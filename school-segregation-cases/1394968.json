Defendants are primary and excess liability insurers,\n\nas well as Transamerica Corporation, the former parent company\n\nof the predecessor manufacturer.\n\n    Over the years, IMO purchased a total of $1.85 billion in\n\ninsurance coverage from all the defendant insurers.       That amount\n\nis sufficient to pay for its anticipated liabilities and defense\n\ncosts for asbestos-related personal injury claims.    Nonetheless,\n\nIMO initiated this litigation to establish its rights under\n\nthose insurance policies and to recover money damages.\n\n    Among many issues and topics, the appeals present some\n\nquestions that have not been previously addressed in the New\n\nJersey Supreme Court's insurance allocation decisions for so-\n\ncalled long-tail environmental losses, beginning with Owens-\n\n\n\n\n                                 7                            A-6240-10T1\n\fIllinois, Inc. v. United Insurance Co., 138 N.J. 437 (1994), and\n\nCarter-Wallace, Inc. v. Admiral Insurance Co., 154 N.J. 312\n\n(1998).   We must decide whether the trial court correctly\n\ntreated primary insurance policies that pay for all litigation\n\ndefense costs \"outside the limits,\" or in addition to, the\n\nindemnification limits of the policies.     We must also decide how\n\nthe coverage limits of excess multi-year policies must be\n\ntreated in the allocation model.     Additional issues include\n\nwhether IMO was entitled to a jury trial on its claims for money\n\ndamages, and numerous challenges to the trial court's\n\ninterpretation of insurance policies within the Owens-Illinois\n\nand Carter-Wallace allocation methodology.\n\n    Having considered the record and the parties' written and\n\noral arguments, we find no ground to reverse the many rulings of\n\nthe several judges who presided over this litigation.     We affirm\n\nthe final judgment of the Law Division.\n\n                                I.\n\n                   Facts and Procedural History\n\nThe Parties\n\n    Plaintiff IMO originated in 1901 as the Delaval Steam\n\nTurbine Company.   It manufactured turbines, pumps, gears, and\n\nother machinery with industrial and military uses, including for\n\nUnited States Navy ships.   In some of Delaval's products\n\n\n\n\n                                8                            A-6240-10T1\n\fmanufactured from the 1940s to the 1980s, component parts\n\ncontained asbestos.\n\n     Defendant Transamerica is a holding company that acquired\n\nDelaval in 1963.   Delaval operated as a subsidiary of\n\nTransamerica under different names until its divestiture in 1986\n\nby means of a spin-off to shareholders.     After the divestiture,\n\nplaintiff became IMO Industries, Inc.\n\n     From the 1960s until 1993, Transamerica owned Transamerica\n\nInsurance Company, which became defendant TIG Insurance Company\n\n(\"TIG\") when it was divested in 1993.     Transamerica acquired\n\nPyramid Insurance Company of Bermuda in the 1970s and still\n\nowned it at the time of this litigation.     Transamerica, TIG, and\n\nPyramid are at times collectively referred to in this litigation\n\nas the Transamerica defendants.\n\n     The other defendants are insurance companies, together with\n\ntheir predecessors and affiliates, that provided different\n\nlevels of primary or excess liability insurance to plaintiff or\n\nTransamerica.   Among the excess insurers that have raised issues\n\non appeal are two groups of insurers that we will refer to in\n\nthis opinion as \"ACE\" and \"LMI.\"1     We will also refer to IMO and\n\nTIG to mean the present company or its predecessors.\n\n\n1\n  \"ACE\" in this opinion shall mean one or more of the following\ninsurers: ACE Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Century\n                                                      (continued)\n\n\n                                  9                         A-6240-10T1\n\fRisk Management Program\n\n    In 1972, Transamerica established a corporate risk\n\nmanagement program (\"TARM\") that oversaw insurance matters for\n\nits subsidiaries.    The objectives of the TARM program were to\n\nprotect Transamerica and its subsidiaries from catastrophic\n\nlosses and to minimize costs for insurance coverage and\n\naccidental losses.   According to Transamerica's director of risk\n\nmanagement in the 1980s, the TARM program was never intended to\n\nbe an insurer for subsidiaries, although Transamerica would\n\noften pay losses that fell within a subsidiary's self-insured\n\nretention (\"SIR\").   A SIR operates in some ways like a\n\ndeductible for an insurance policy but also is significantly\n\ndifferent, as we will discuss later in this opinion.   The TARM\n\nprogram procured insurance on behalf of Transamerica's\n\nsubsidiaries in exchange for an annual fee.   The fee covered the\n\ncosts of purchasing insurance, TARM's operating costs, and the\n\nsubsidiary's share of losses.\n\n\n(continued)\nIndemnity Company, CCI Insurance Company, Insurance Company of\nNorth America, Indemnity Insurance Company of North America,\nCentral National Insurance Company of Omaha, Service Fire\nInsurance Company, Industrial Underwriters Insurance Company,\nand Pacific Employers Insurance Company.\n\n  \"LMI\" stands for \"London Market Insurers\" and shall mean one\nor more of individual Lloyd's syndicates or London Market\ncompanies.\n\n\n\n\n                                 10                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    Transamerica would charge back its payments covering a\n\nsubsidiary's SIRs through the risk management fees.\n\nSubsidiaries like IMO that experienced unique or significant\n\nlosses were also charged a catastrophe fee beyond the normal\n\nrisk management fee.   Before its divestiture in 1986, IMO had\n\npaid approximately $33 million in such fees to Transamerica.\n\nIMO's Insurance Policies\n\n    Before 1964, IMO had general liability policies issued by\n\nNew Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (\"NJM\") and Aetna\n\nCasualty and Surety Company (\"Aetna\").   From 1964 to 1972, IMO\n\npurchased primary insurance directly from TIG.   We will refer to\n\nthese pre-1972 policies as TIG's \"direct policies.\"\n\n    From 1972 through 1976, Transamerica purchased insurance on\n\nbehalf of IMO from the Highlands Insurance Company.   The\n\nHighlands policies were written above a $100,000 SIR, meaning\n\nthat IMO's losses must exceed that level of loss from any single\n\noccurrence before it could access coverage under the Highlands\n\npolicies.   There was no insurance in place to cover IMO's SIR.\n\nTIG also issued excess policies to IMO during this time period.\n\n    From 1977 to 1986, Transamerica purchased first-layer\n\nexcess insurance coverage for IMO from ACE and Pyramid.     These\n\npolicies also required SIRs.   To cover the SIRs, Transamerica\n\npurchased insurance policies from TIG, which are referred to in\n\n\n\n\n                                11                          A-6240-10T1\n\fthis litigation as \"fronting policies.\"     These policies allowed\n\nIMO to obtain insurance certificates showing full coverage for\n\nall losses.    The \"fronting\" reference meant there was no risk\n\nassumed by the insurance carrier, here TIG.2\n\n     The TIG fronting policies had stated coverage limits of $1\n\nmillion from 1977 through 1984 and higher limits for 1985 and\n\n1986, totaling in the aggregate $10.75 million for the ten-year\n\nperiod.   For the fronting policies in effect from 1977 through\n\n1981, defense costs were paid \"outside the limits\" of the\n\npolicies.     This means that the policies would pay their stated\n\n$1 million indemnity limits plus defense costs; the defense\n\ncosts were supplemental to the indemnification coverage and did\n\nnot erode the indemnity limits.     We will refer to these policies\n\nas \"outside the limits\" policies.      Defense costs for the\n\npolicies in effect from 1982 through 1986 were within the policy\n\n2\n  \"Fronting\" means \"[t]he use of a licensed, admitted insurer to\nissue an insurance policy on behalf of a self-insured\norganization or captive insurer without the intention of\ntransferring any of the risk. The risk of loss is retained by\nthe self-insured or captive insurer with an indemnity or\nreinsurance agreement. . . . Fronting arrangements allow\ncaptives and self-insurers to comply with financial\nresponsibility laws imposed by many states that require evidence\nof coverage written by an admitted insurer, such as for\nautomobile liability and workers compensation insurance.\"\nFronting, IRMI Risk & Ins., http://www.irmi.com/online/\ninsurance-glossary/terms/f/fronting.aspx (last visited Sept. 4,\n2014); see also Richard V. Rupp, Insurance & Risk Management\nGlossary 150 (1991) (fronting insurer issues policy on behalf of\ncaptive insurer but assumes little or no financial exposure).\n\n\n\n                                  12                           A-6240-10T1\n\flimits, meaning payments for defense costs did erode the\n\nindemnity limits.\n\n    Thus, IMO had \"direct policies\" from TIG from 1964 through\n\n1972, excess policies at various times including 1972 through\n\n1976, and \"fronting policies\" from 1977 to 1986, the first five\n\nyears of which were \"outside the limits\" policies.   Over the\n\nyears since the 1986 divestiture, TIG made payments totaling\n\nmore than $30 million for IMO's asbestos liabilities and defense\n\ncosts from both its direct and fronting policies.    Adding TIG's\n\npayments from excess policies, TIG paid IMO more than $72\n\nmillion for its asbestos liabilities and costs.\n\n    IMO also received payments from Pyramid's excess policies,\n\nincluding from the time that TIG claimed it had no more\n\nresponsibility for IMO's losses.\n\n    Digressing briefly from the facts to restate the lead issue\n\nin this appeal, TIG claims its policies are exhausted because it\n\nhas paid far more than the amount of loss allocated to it under\n\nthe Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace loss allocation model.\n\nIMO contends TIG's obligations have not ended because the\n\nindemnification limits of the \"outside the limits\" policies\n\ncannot be exhausted by allocating responsibility to those\n\npolicies.   It contends only actual payments that reach the $1\n\nmillion dollar indemnification limits will exhaust TIG's\n\n\n\n\n                                13                          A-6240-10T1\n\fobligation to cover defense costs under the five years of\n\n\"outside the limits\" policies.    According to IMO, as of the end\n\nof 2010, TIG owed an additional $48 million in defense costs\n\nunder those policies.\n\nTransamerica's Agreements with TIG\n\n    Between 1976 and 1992, Transamerica entered into four\n\nagreements with TIG to indemnify TIG for its payments under the\n\nfronting policies.   In 1992, Transamerica and TIG also entered\n\ninto an agreement with regard to the pre-1972 direct policies\n\npursuant to which Transamerica would contribute to TIG half the\n\ntotal amounts of defense and indemnity sought by IMO for\n\nasbestos litigation.    The result of these agreements was that\n\nTransamerica actually paid approximately half the amounts paid\n\nby TIG to IMO under its direct and fronting policies.\n\nDivestiture of IMO\n\n    In 1986, Transamerica divested IMO's predecessor by\n\nspinning off its shares to Transamerica shareholders, and the\n\nnew company became IMO.    The terms of the divestiture were\n\ncontained in a Distribution Agreement dated December 18, 1986.\n\nOn the subject of insurance coverage, the agreement stated:\n\n         Section 6.02 Insurance With respect to all\n         insurance plans of [IMO], [IMO] shall be\n         liable for payment of claims (to the extent\n         not covered by Transamerica's Risk\n         Management Program) arising out of\n         incidents, known or unknown, reported or\n\n\n\n                                 14                         A-6240-10T1\n\f            unreported, which were incurred prior or\n            subsequent to the Distribution Date.\n\n            [(Emphasis added).]\n\nA dispute on appeal pertains to the underscored language and the\n\nobligations, if any, it imposes upon Transamerica after the\n\ndivestiture.\n\nAsbestos Lawsuits, IFAs, and Exhaustion of Policies\n\n    At the time of the 1986 divestiture, IMO had been named as\n\na third-party defendant in three asbestos liability lawsuits.\n\nIMO tendered these claims to TIG for indemnification and\n\ndefense.    TIG provided one hundred percent of the funds to pay\n\nthese claims, and Transamerica then reimbursed TIG at least half\n\nthat amount pursuant to their agreements.     Many more asbestos\n\nclaims were filed after the divestiture, and TIG continued to\n\nprovide a defense to IMO under both its direct policies and its\n\nfronting policies.\n\n    In 1989, IMO sent \"first notice\" letters to excess\n\ninsurers.    These letters made no demand for payment and provided\n\nminimal information about the claims against IMO or any\n\nunderlying policies that might be in place.     In fact, according\n\nto the excess insurers, IMO told them it had ample primary\n\ninsurance coverage and their policies were unlikely to be\n\nreached in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n                                  15                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    In 1991, IMO discovered NJM's and Aetna's older primary\n\ninsurance policies and tendered its asbestos claims to NJM and\n\nto Travelers Insurance Company (\"Travelers\") as successor to\n\nAetna.   Aetna's policies covered IMO from 1955 to 1964.    On\n\nSeptember 30, 1992, IMO entered into an Interim Defense and\n\nIndemnification Funding Agreement (\"IFA\") with TIG and\n\nAetna/Travelers under which all defense costs were to be paid by\n\nTIG and Aetna, and indemnity payments were split in three equal\n\nshares among TIG, Aetna, and IMO.\n\n    NJM, on the other hand, did not acknowledge coverage on its\n\nprimary liability policies issued to IMO from 1935 through 1954.\n\nIMO filed suit against NJM and was successful in compelling it\n\nto provide coverage.   On March 24, 1993, IMO entered into an IFA\n\nwith NJM, which applied in conjunction with the earlier IFA with\n\nTIG and Aetna/Travelers.   Neither of the two IFAs was intended\n\nto be a final allocation of IMO's losses, and both reserved the\n\nparties' rights to seek reallocation of the amounts paid.\n\n    Under the two IFAs, defense costs were split equally among\n\nAetna, NJM, and TIG, and indemnity costs were split equally\n\namong the three insurers and IMO.    In 1998, NJM declared its\n\npolicies exhausted, having paid $4,234,703 in defense and\n\nindemnity costs.   It made no further payments after that time.\n\nWhen Aetna balked at continuing payments, IMO filed suit against\n\n\n\n\n                                16                          A-6240-10T1\n\fAetna and IMO's excess insurers seeking to compel payments under\n\nAetna's IFA.   IMO did not actively pursue the matter against the\n\nexcess insurers, and in 2000 it voluntarily dismissed them from\n\nthe litigation.   A new sharing arrangement was reached among\n\nAetna/Travelers, TIG, and IMO under which Aetna paid one fourth\n\nof defense costs and one fourth of indemnity costs, IMO paid one\n\nthird of indemnity costs and none of the defense costs, and the\n\nbalance of both types of costs was paid by TIG.\n\n    Aetna declared its policies exhausted in August 2003,\n\nhaving paid a total of $15,240,064.   IMO did not challenge\n\nAetna's declaration of exhaustion.    TIG then continued making\n\npayments under the IFAs for several more months, paying one\n\nhundred percent of defense costs and two thirds of the indemnity\n\ncosts.   All of IMO's defense costs through the end of 2003 were\n\npaid by means of the IFAs, and IMO incurred no unreimbursed\n\ndefense costs through that time.\n\n    In early 2004, when TIG declared its 1977 through 1986\n\nfronting policy limits exhausted, TIG had paid a total of\n\n$30,856,193 to IMO as reimbursement of indemnity and defense\n\ncosts, these payments being allocated by TIG to both its pre-\n\n1972 direct policies and to the 1977 through 1986 fronting\n\npolicies.\n\n\n\n\n                                17                          A-6240-10T1\n\fOwens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace\n\n    The New Jersey Supreme Court's 1994 decision in Owens-\n\nIllinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 478-79, first established the\n\n\"continuous trigger\" theory of insurance coverage for long-tail\n\nenvironmental losses, such as exposure to asbestos.    The Court\n\ndefined the term \"occurrence\" in liability policies to mean a\n\nseparate triggering event for insurance coverage in each year\n\nfrom the time a claimant alleging injury was first exposed to\n\nasbestos until manifestation of an asbestos-related disease or\n\nuntil insurance coverage became unavailable.   Ibid.   The Court\n\nalso established a pro-rated model for the allocation of\n\ncoverage responsibilities among multiple insurers based on an\n\ninsurer's time on the loss and limits of risk coverage in the\n\npolicies.   Id. at 474-75.\n\n    In July 1998, the Court issued its decision in Carter-\n\nWallace, supra, 154 N.J. 312, as further development of the\n\nallocation methodology.   The Court held that excess insurers\n\nwere included in the model, and that policies would be exhausted\n\n\"vertically\" in each year of coverage applicable to a claim\n\nrather than all primary insurance policies being exhausted\n\n\"horizontally\" first across the range of \"triggered\" coverage\n\nyears before excess insurers' policies would attach.    Id. at\n\n325-28.\n\n\n\n\n                                18                         A-6240-10T1\n\f    In November 1998, representatives from IMO, TIG, and\n\nTransamerica met and discussed applying the Carter-Wallace\n\nallocation methodology to IMO's claims.   IMO's General Counsel\n\nstrongly disagreed with Carter-Wallace and refused to apply its\n\nmethodology to allocate responsibility among IMO's insurers.      He\n\nwas satisfied with the IFA arrangements in place where IMO paid\n\na third of indemnity and no defense costs.\n\nThe Present Litigation\n\n    In 2002, IMO sought assurance from the Transamerica\n\ndefendants that they would continue to pay full defense costs\n\nand most of the indemnity costs for asbestos claims.   When\n\nassurance was not given, IMO filed its initial complaint in\n\nAugust 2003 against the Transamerica defendants.\n\n    In early 2004, the Transamerica defendants informed IMO\n\nthat TIG's fronting policies were exhausted as of December 31,\n\n2003.   A February 4, 2004 letter written by counsel for Pyramid\n\nstated that, up to December 31, 2003, Transamerica had paid \"at\n\nleast $9,703,101 in indemnity for asbestos bodily injury claims,\n\nand at least $5,138,148 for expenses for those claims\" and that\n\nthose sums exceeded the amount of the SIRs and the limits of\n\nTIG's fronting policies.   The letter informed IMO that any\n\nfuture payments for indemnity and expenses would be paid \"by\n\nPyramid's excess policies, up to the limits of the Pyramid\n\n\n\n\n                                19                         A-6240-10T1\n\fpolicies.\"   Pyramid's future payments would be based on its\n\nCarter-Wallace allocation share after a short transitional\n\nperiod.\n\n     Although IMO eventually added the excess insurers to the\n\npresent litigation, it initially told them in private meetings\n\nthat it had done so to avoid inconsistent judgments if active\n\nlitigation against the excess insurers were to become necessary\n\nin the future.   IMO reassured the excess insurers that their\n\npolicies were not going to be reached because the TIG \"outside\n\nthe limits\" policies for 1977 through 1981 would never reach\n\ntheir limits of coverage.3\n\n     In July 2005, IMO appeared to waver in its belief that the\n\nTIG policies had not been exhausted.    As a result, Pyramid\n\nagreed that its excess policies were triggered and advanced IMO\n\n$2 million toward defense invoices.    In August 2005, however,\n\n\n\n\n3\n  According to TIG and some of the excess insurers, IMO\noriginally took the position that the $1 million limits of the\nfronting policies would never be reached because each asbestos\npersonal injury claim was a separate occurrence, and IMO's\nindemnification liability for those claims was a relatively\nsmall amount. No individual asbestos claim would exhaust the $1\nmillion in indemnification coverage and TIG would perpetually\nhave to provide defense costs on the \"outside the limits\"\npolicies. As we will explain further, IMO and its expert\npresented a different version of their theory of \"limitless\ndefense costs\" during this litigation that did not rely on a\nseparate occurrence and $1 million dollars of indemnity coverage\nfor each individual claim.\n\n\n\n                                20                         A-6240-10T1\n\fIMO again asserted that the TIG policies had not been exhausted.\n\nPyramid then stopped making payments.\n\n    On August 21, 2007, IMO wrote to excess insurers demanding\n\nthat they pay IMO's asbestos losses in accordance with an\n\nallocation calculated by IMO's expert, Dr. Charles Mullin.      In\n\nhis trial testimony, Mullin reviewed his calculations and agreed\n\nthat they indicated TIG's fronting policies should be allocated\n\n$13,349,296 in defense and indemnity costs.      He subsequently\n\nadjusted that figure to $13,433,600.\n\n    Since making its August 2007 demand on excess insurers, IMO\n\nhas settled with more than a dozen of them, with total policy\n\nlimits of at least $708 million.      Some of the excess insurers\n\nthat did not settle and raise issues in this appeal have also\n\npaid millions of dollars to IMO under their policies.\n\n    On September 10, 2008, IMO produced a new allocation of\n\nlosses and claimed that TIG and Transamerica owed millions more\n\nthan the approximately $13.5 million calculated in Mullin's\n\nearlier allocations.    IMO based this claim on TIG's continuing\n\nobligation to pay defense costs under the first five fronting\n\npolicies until its actual payments of indemnification\n\nobligations, rather than allocation, reached the $1 million\n\nlevel of each policy.    IMO claimed that allocation of losses to\n\nthe fronting policies under the Carter-Wallace model was not\n\n\n\n\n                                 21                          A-6240-10T1\n\fsufficient to reach their limits but actual payment had to be\n\nmade by TIG in accordance with the language of those policies.\n\n    In this litigation, IMO has referred to this coverage\n\nposition by several different names, including \"bookend\" and\n\n\"limitless defense costs.\"   The Transamerica defendants refer to\n\nit as the \"running spigot\" theory of coverage under TIG's\n\nfronting policies of 1977 through 1981.   The crux of this theory\n\nis that, with defense costs being paid outside the policy\n\nlimits, TIG's obligation to cover defense costs for claims that\n\ncould be attributed to those policy years would continue until\n\nTIG actually paid $1 million in indemnity costs from the policy\n\nin each of those years.   With the small amount of indemnity\n\npayments on the liability that IMO has for injured plaintiffs in\n\nasbestos cases (many of those cases settling for only several\n\nthousand dollars from IMO), the limits of the TIG \"outside the\n\nlimits\" policies would not be reached for many years.     TIG's\n\nobligation to continue paying for defense costs would continue\n\nindefinitely.\n\nPleadings and Pre-Trial Proceedings\n\n    IMO began this litigation with its first complaint and jury\n\ndemand filed in August 2003 against only the Transamerica\n\ndefendants.   It sought a declaration of rights and obligations\n\nunder the TARM program and under the primary and excess\n\n\n\n\n                                22                          A-6240-10T1\n\finsurance policies issued by TIG and Pyramid.     It also sought\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract and\n\nrelated causes of action.    Defendants filed answers, cross-\n\nclaims, counterclaims, and a third-party complaint against three\n\nexcess insurance carriers.\n\n    In 2004, IMO filed a second amended complaint, adding new\n\nclaims against the Transamerica defendants and also naming\n\nnumerous excess insurers as defendants.      Over time in this\n\nlitigation, most of the excess insurers either settled with IMO\n\nor were dismissed from the case.      Twelve defendants remained in\n\nthe case at the time of the trials beginning in 2009.\n\n    In the intervening time, the court entered orders holding\n\nthat New Jersey law is applicable to certain pertinent issues,\n\ngranting or denying summary judgment on various grounds,\n\ndetermining that the Carter-Wallace allocation methodology would\n\nbe applied, and appointing a special allocation master (\"SAM\")\n\nto consider all allocation-related issues and to make\n\nrecommendations to the trial judge.\n\n    In January 2009, Retired Judge Robert Muir, Jr., was\n\nrecalled to the bench and assigned to the case.      At about that\n\ntime, Pyramid and TIG renewed motions they had filed earlier to\n\nstrike plaintiff's jury demand and to proceed with a bench\n\ntrial.   On June 30, 2009, Judge Muir granted the motions and\n\n\n\n\n                                 23                          A-6240-10T1\n\fordered that all issues would be tried without a jury.   This\n\ncourt and the Supreme Court denied IMO's motions for leave to\n\nappeal that ruling.\n\nBench Trials on Discrete Issues\n\n    In June 2009, Judge Muir tried the issues related to\n\ncertain excess insurers in a four-day bench trial.   He issued a\n\nfinal decision and order on the excess insurers' coverage\n\ndisputes on December 16, 2009.    Several excess insurers â€”\n\nincluding ACE, LMI, and Zurich American Insurance Company and\n\nits predecessors and affiliates (\"Zurich\") â€” have cross-\n\nappealed, challenging Judge Muir's December 2009 decision as\n\nwell as other aspects of the final judgment entered two years\n\nlater.\n\n    After the June 2009 bench trial, Judge Muir scheduled\n\nseparate bench trials on two major issues.    At the Phase I trial\n\nconducted in the early months of 2010, the issue was whether the\n\nTIG fronting policies were in fact exhausted.   Judge Muir found\n\nby an oral decision on October 14, 2010, that the policies were\n\nnot only exhausted by the end of 2003, but that TIG had overpaid\n\nits obligations.\n\n    In reaching that conclusion, Judge Muir found that IMO's\n\nallocation expert, Mullin, was not a credible witness and that\n\nIMO's \"limitless defense costs\" or \"running spigot\" theory was\n\n\n\n\n                                  24                          A-6240-10T1\n\fnot supported by the evidence or legal precedent.   He determined\n\nthat TIG had paid $9,655,200 in indemnity losses and $6,254,400\n\nin defense costs, for a total of $15,909,600 paid under its\n\nfronting policies of 1977 through 1986 and also excess policies\n\nfrom 1972 through 1976.   Since the judge's findings allocated\n\n$13,636,700 to IMO's defense costs and indemnification losses\n\nduring that time period based on an allocation model prepared by\n\nthe SAM, TIG had overpaid its obligations by $2,271,900.    Judge\n\nMuir stated it would be inequitable and unconscionable to allow\n\nIMO to keep the overpayments, but he did not rule further with\n\nrespect to disposition of TIG's overpayments, and did not reach\n\nany decision as to payments TIG had made under its pre-1972\n\ndirect policies.\n\n    At the Phase II trial held in the spring of 2010, Judge\n\nMuir considered the dispute between IMO and Transamerica.     In\n\nhis written decision issued on December 29, 2010, the judge\n\nfound that IMO had failed to establish the existence of an\n\nimplied-in-fact contract requiring Transamerica to continue\n\nreimbursing IMO for its SIRs and other unreimbursed costs of\n\nasbestos claims, and that the written Distribution Agreement\n\ncontrolling the 1986 divestiture of IMO is an unambiguous\n\ncontract that governs the issues between IMO and Transamerica.\n\nThe judge rejected IMO's assertion that Transamerica was IMO's\n\n\n\n\n                                25                          A-6240-10T1\n\fde facto insurer for its SIRs, deductibles, and other expenses,\n\nand he dismissed IMO's claims for breach of contract, estoppel,\n\nand bad faith.\n\n    Judge Muir completed his service on recall in January 2011\n\nafter issuing his decisions on the Phase I and Phase II trials.\n\nRetired Judge Donald Coburn was then assigned on recall to\n\npreside over the case.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\n    Following the Phase I trial, the SAM prepared a retroactive\n\nallocation of IMO's losses, which \"ignored\" payments by TIG and\n\nothers in calculating the allocation figures and made no\n\nrecommendations as to the treatment of overpayments by TIG that\n\nJudge Muir had found.    Because the SAM's report attributed\n\ndefense costs to TIG after 2003, it concluded that TIG still\n\nowed IMO almost $2 million under the fronting policies.\n\n    Judge Coburn directed the SAM to prepare a new loss\n\nallocation report that did not accept IMO's \"running spigot\"\n\ntheory and took into account all payments made by TIG.    The\n\nSAM's revised allocation schedule issued in April 2011 was based\n\non total estimated costs to IMO of $325 million through the end\n\nof 2010.   It allocated $15,232,832 to the TIG fronting policies\n\nunder what TIG calls a \"modified spigot\" theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                 26                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    In his ruling on the final loss allocation, Judge Coburn\n\nrejected parts of the SAM's revised allocation schedule as\n\ncontrary to Judge Muir's Phase I decision.    Applying Judge\n\nMuir's decision that TIG payments from policy years that were\n\noverpaid would be transferred to those years that were\n\nunderpaid, Judge Coburn determined that all payments from TIG,\n\nincluding those previously attributed to the pre-1972 direct\n\npolicies, could be transferred to determine if policies were\n\nexhausted under the proper Carter-Wallace allocation.      He\n\nfurther found that the \"running spigot\" theory was not supported\n\nby IMO's own reasonable expectations when it procured the\n\ninsurance policies, and that the allocation of additional\n\ndefense costs to the fronting policies would be disproportionate\n\nto the degree of risk transferred to TIG under those policies.\n\n    Judge Coburn adjusted the SAM's calculation by reducing\n\ndefense costs attributed to TIG by the amounts incurred after\n\nthe TIG policies were exhausted.    He allocated $8,165,364 in\n\nindemnity and $5,159,341 in defense costs to TIG's pre-1972\n\ndirect policies, a total of $13,324,705.    He allocated\n\n$8,403,478 in indemnity and $5,342,606 in defense costs to TIG's\n\nfronting policies, a total of $13,746,084.    By taking into\n\naccount TIG's payments under the IFAs, which totaled\n\n$30,856,193, and also payments made by another insurer\n\n\n\n\n                               27                               A-6240-10T1\n\faffiliated with TIG, Judge Coburn determined that TIG had\n\noverpaid IMO $15,201,438, which he rounded off to $15,200,000.\n\n    Judge Coburn suggested that the parties discuss resolution\n\nof how that amount might be reimbursed to TIG by the excess\n\ninsurers that had coverage obligations.   The parties, however,\n\nwere not able to resolve the issue.   By final judgment dated\n\nAugust 16, 2011, the judge awarded $15,200,000 to TIG as money\n\ndamages against IMO for TIG's overpayments on its policies, plus\n\nprejudgment interest of $1,400,000.   Of the amount awarded to\n\nTIG, the judgment accounted for a total of $8,521,771 as sums\n\npaid or to be paid by ACE, LMI, and one other excess insurer to\n\nIMO, the balance being IMO's separate responsibility.\n\n    The final judgment also declared that Transamerica had no\n\nfurther obligation to IMO for its asbestos claims, and the\n\nexcess insurers were ordered to pay their shares according to\n\nthe allocation schedule adopted by the final judgment.    The\n\njudgment also denied IMO's application for attorneys' fees and\n\nprejudgment interest and Transamerica's application for\n\nattorneys' fees under an indemnification provision of the 1986\n\nDistribution Agreement.   All remaining claims, counterclaims,\n\nand cross-claims that were not specifically addressed in the\n\nfinal judgment were dismissed with prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                28                          A-6240-10T1\n\f                                 II.\n\n              Exhaustion of TIG's Fronting Policies\n\n    The lead issue in the case â€” the exhaustion issue â€” is\n\nwhether TIG must cover defense costs for an endless or\n\nindefinite time until it has actually paid the indemnification\n\nlimits of its policies, or whether those policies were exhausted\n\nand TIG has no further obligations to IMO.\n\n    IMO, some excess insurers, and amicus curiae Independent\n\nEnergy Producers of New Jersey claim error in Judge Muir's\n\nexhaustion decision and its implementation by Judge Coburn in\n\nthe final allocation judgment.    They contend the judges failed\n\nto hold TIG liable for a continuing obligation to pay defense\n\ncosts although the fronting policies from 1977 through 1981\n\nrequire payment of defense costs \"outside the limits\" of the\n\nindemnification coverage.\n\n    The policies provide that the insurer will \"not be\n\nobligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit\n\nafter the applicable limit of the company's liability has been\n\nexhausted by payment of judgments or settlements\" (emphasis\n\nadded).   IMO argues that the policies unambiguously require\n\nexhaustion by formal payment, not just by allocation of\n\nsufficient losses to the policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                 29                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    Before we address this argument, we will review Owens-\n\nIllinois, supra, 138 N.J. 437, and some cases that followed it.\n\nOwens-Illinois is the seminal case in New Jersey setting forth\n\nthe methodology for proportional allocation of indemnity and\n\ndefense costs among multiple insurers in \"long-tail\"\n\nenvironmental exposure litigation.   Spaulding Composites Co. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 176 N.J. 25, 39 (2003), cert. denied sub\n\nnom. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Caldwell Trucking PRP Grp., 540\n\nU.S. 1142, 124 S. Ct. 1061, 157 L.

Owens-Illinois, supra,\n\n138 N.J. at 447.   The Court explained that, where injuries were\n\nsustained over long periods of time, questions arise as to when\n\nand how liability insurance coverage of the allegedly\n\nresponsible parties is triggered and as to how losses should be\n\nfairly allocated among the range of triggered policies.\n\nSpaulding Composites, supra, 176 N.J. at 32.   The Court observed\n\nthat rigid enforcement of the policy terms as governed by\n\ntraditional principles of insurance law could not capture the\n\ntime of an occurrence in the context of such toxic-tort\n\nlitigation.   Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 457-59.    It\n\nconcluded that \"[m]ass-exposure toxic-tort cases have simply\n\n\n\n\n                                30                          A-6240-10T1\n\fexceeded the capacity of conventional models of judicial\n\nresponse.\"    Id. at 459.\n\n    The Court reviewed a number of options to resolve the\n\nquestion of determining the \"occurrence\" of an injury that does\n\nnot manifest for many years.      It ultimately adopted a\n\n\"continuous-trigger\" theory by which an injury would trigger\n\ncoverage continuously from the date of the claimant's first\n\nexposure to asbestos onward as a single \"occurrence\" for each\n\nyear.    Id. at 478-79.     The Court then adopted a pro-rata\n\nallocation methodology, distributing the insured's losses for\n\nthe triggered time period in percentage shares commensurate with\n\nthe \"degree of risk transferred or retained in each of the years\n\nof repeated exposure to injurious conditions.\"       Id. at 475.     The\n\nresulting allocation among insurance policies would thus be\n\n\"related to both the time on the risk and the degree of risk\n\nassumed.\"    Id. at 479.    The insured would share in the\n\nallocation for periods where it voluntarily retained the risk\n\nrather than contracting for available insurance.       Ibid.    Policy\n\nlimits and exclusions would remain applicable, and the resulting\n\nallocation would conform to the particulars of the policies at\n\nissue.   Id. at 476.\n\n    The Court \"recognize[d] the difficulties of apportioning\n\ncosts with any scientific certainty,\" but accepted that a \"rough\n\n\n\n\n                                    31                          A-6240-10T1\n\fmeasure\" of each insurer's proportionate allocation of losses\n\nmight be the best that could be achieved.    Id. at 476-77.     The\n\nCourt never independently addressed allocation of defense costs\n\nas opposed to indemnification for claims that the insured would\n\nhave to pay to the injured person, though the undeniable\n\nimplication of Owens-Illinois is that defense costs are also\n\nallocable, subject to policy terms, in the same manner as\n\nindemnity expenditures.\n\n    In Carter-Wallace, supra, 154 N.J. at 325-27, the Court\n\nconfirmed the application of the continuous-trigger theory and\n\npro-rata methodology in allocating liability among both primary\n\nand excess policies.   It rejected an argument made by the\n\nsecond-level excess insurer in that case that the insured party\n\nmust exhaust all primary and first-level excess policies in the\n\nentire coverage block before accessing any second-level excess\n\ncoverage.   Id. at 324.\n\n    The Court also rejected the insured's contention that the\n\nentire universe of losses should be collapsed to a single year\n\nso as to access immediately the coverage from all insurers for\n\nthat one year.   Id. at 325.   Neither of these arguments was\n\nfaithful to the holding of Owens-Illinois that ongoing injuries\n\nshould be treated as a single occurrence within each year.\n\nConsequently, the Court adopted an approach requiring that\n\n\n\n\n                                 32                           A-6240-10T1\n\flosses first be allocated \"horizontally\" among the range of\n\nyears in the coverage block, but that policies be exhausted\n\n\"vertically\" within each year, such that each successive layer\n\nof insurance within a given year would be accessed as the one\n\nbelow was exhausted.   Id. at 327-28.   The Court added:\n\n         Our jurisprudence in this area has not been\n         marked by rigid mathematical formulas, and\n         we do not advocate any such inflexibility\n         now. Rather, our focus remains on \"[a] fair\n         method of allocation . . . that is related\n         to both the time on the risk and the degree\n         of risk assumed.\" [Owens-Illinois, supra,\n         138 N.J.] at 479. Nevertheless, we\n         anticipate that the principles of Owens-\n         Illinois, as clarified by our decision\n         today, represent the presumptive rule for\n         resolving the allocation issue among primary\n         and excess insurers in continuous trigger\n         liability cases unless exceptional\n         circumstances dictate application of a\n         different standard.\n\n         [Carter-Wallace, supra, 154 N.J. at 327-28.]\n\n    In Spaulding Composites, supra, 176 N.J. at 28, the Court\n\nconsidered whether application of a \"non-cumulation\" clause in a\n\ncomprehensive general liability policy could be enforced\n\nconsistently with the Owens-Illinois methodology.    Such clauses\n\n\"operate[] to limit an insurer's liability under multiple\n\nsequential . . . policies where losses related to a 'single\n\noccurrence' trigger the successive policies.\"    Id. at 43-44\n\n(emphasis added).   The purpose of such clauses is to avoid the\n\n\"'cumulation' of policy limits for damage arising out of [a]\n\n\n\n                                33                          A-6240-10T1\n\fsingle occurrence . . . .\"    Id. at 44.   Because Owens-Illinois\n\nhad explicitly rejected the theory that an injury in a long-term\n\nenvironmental exposure case constitutes one single occurrence,\n\nthe Court held that non-cumulation clauses simply did not apply\n\nin that context.   Ibid.   It added:\n\n         [E]ven if the non-cumulation clause was not\n         facially inapplicable, we would not enforce\n         it because it would thwart the Owens-\n         Illinois pro-rata allocation modality. Once\n         the court turns to pro rata allocation, it\n         makes sense that the non-cumulation clause,\n         which would allow the insurer to avoid its\n         fair share of responsibility, drops out of\n         the policy.\n\n         [Ibid.]\n\nThus Spaulding Composites supports the proposition that the\n\nOwens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation model supersedes\n\ncontrary terms of an insurance policy.\n\n    The Court again affirmed the allocation model in Benjamin\n\nMoore & Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 179 N.J. 87, 91\n\n(2004), but this time the Court adhered to the language of the\n\npolicies where they did not conflict with the allocation model.\n\nIn Benjamin Moore, the Court determined that an insured would\n\nhave to satisfy its full per-occurrence deductibles for each\n\npolicy before accessing indemnity coverage.     In so doing, the\n\nCourt clarified that:\n\n         when a policy is triggered, so are its\n         fundamental terms and conditions. Although\n\n\n\n                                 34                         A-6240-10T1\n\f         Owens-Illinois did not turn on policy\n         language or traditional interpretation rules\n         because it was crafting an overarching\n         scheme for solving the scientifically\n         unsolvable problem of determining how to\n         allocate progressive environmental damage to\n         sequential policies, that scheme was\n         nevertheless meant to be superimposed on the\n         specific terms of insurance contracts. That\n         is why the Owens-Illinois allocation\n         methodology is subject to \"limits and\n         exclusions.\" In other words, Owens-Illinois\n         was never intended to displace the basic\n         provisions of the insurance contract so long\n         as those provisions are not inconsistent\n         with the underlying methodology specifically\n         adopted in that case.\n\n         [Id. at 101 (emphasis added and citations\n         omitted).]\n\n    IMO argues this last-quoted explanation by the Court means\n\nthat the Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation\n\nmethodology must be superimposed over the terms of TIG's\n\nfronting policies rather than superseding those terms.     If, as\n\nIMO contends, the policies require that only actual payments for\n\nIMO's losses can relieve TIG of its contractual obligation to\n\npay for defense costs, total coverage of IMO's losses and the\n\nattachment point for excess insurers will be affected.\n\n    IMO and amicus curiae contend that Judge Coburn mistakenly\n\ndeemed the policy language requiring actual payment to be\n\nambiguous and inappropriately resolved that ambiguity in favor\n\nof his own belief that a reasonable insured would never expect\n\ncoverage of defense costs far exceeding the indemnity limits of\n\n\n\n                               35                           A-6240-10T1\n\fa policy.   Judge Coburn commented that an insurer would pay its\n\nindemnification limit in full before incurring a much larger\n\nobligation to pay defense costs, but IMO and amicus curiae\n\ncontend that case law prohibits an insurer that provided\n\n\"outside the limits\" defense coverage from avoiding its\n\nobligations by paying its indemnity limit and then abandoning\n\nthe insured.   See, e.g., Chubb/Pacific Indem. Group v. Ins. Co.\n\nof N. Am., 233 Cal. Rptr. 539, 543 (Ct. App. 1987); Douglas v.\n\nAllied Am. Ins., 727 N.E.2d 376, 382 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000);\n\nSimmons v. Jeffords, 260 F. Supp. 641, 642 (E.D. Pa. 1966).\n\n    According to IMO and amicus curiae, many insureds actively\n\nseek and bargain for limitless coverage of litigation defense\n\nand related costs.   Amicus curiae cites examples in the federal\n\ncourts to support its argument that such coverage may far exceed\n\nthe limits of the indemnification obligation of the insurer.\n\nSee, e.g., Emhart Indus. v. Home Ins. Co., 515 F. Supp. 2d 228,\n\n231, 257 (D.R.I. 2007), affâ€™d sub nom. Emhart Indus. v. Century\n\nIndem. Co., 559 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n    In his final allocation decision, Judge Coburn first noted\n\nthat coverage for defense costs outside policy limits was\n\nprovided in policies representing only $40.6 million of more\n\nthan $1.85 billion of total coverage.   Consequently, the SAM's\n\nallocation schedule had \"only used the indemnity amount of each\n\n\n\n\n                                36                          A-6240-10T1\n\fpolicy without attempting to include any value for those\n\nportions of policies that paid defense costs in addition to the\n\nface amount.\"   The parties agreed with this approach for the\n\nsake of efficiency since the difference in the allocation\n\npercentages would be negligible.\n\n    Judge Coburn disagreed with IMO that the policy language of\n\nTIG's \"outside the limits\" fronting policies unambiguously\n\nrequires exhaustion by formal payment.   He stated he would\n\nconstrue that language consistently with Owens-Illinois and the\n\nreasonable expectations of the parties to permit exhaustion by\n\nallocation of indemnity losses rather than by actual payment of\n\nthose losses.   Judge Coburn also adopted Judge Muir's conclusion\n\nthat all of TIG's payments pursuant to the IFAs, whether or not\n\nreimbursed by Transamerica, would count to satisfy the limits of\n\nthe fronting policies.   He agreed with Judge Muir that annual\n\npolicy limits would be exhausted by crediting across coverage\n\nyears payments that TIG had previously attributed to one policy\n\nyear to a different underpaid policy year.   As a result of his\n\ncalculations, Judge Coburn not only accepted Judge Muir's\n\nearlier conclusion that the fronting policies had been exhausted\n\nby the end of 2003, but he found that some of the \"outside the\n\nlimits\" policies had been exhausted in 1999 and others in 2000.\n\nIMO complains that not even TIG and Transamerica claimed that\n\n\n\n\n                                37                          A-6240-10T1\n\fthe fronting policies were exhausted earlier than the end of\n\n2003.\n\n    IMO and amicus curiae also criticize Judge Coburn's\n\nstatements that the expectations of the parties would not make\n\nsense if the obligation of TIG to pay defense costs far exceeded\n\nits obligation to provide indemnity coverage under any policy.\n\nThey argue that many liability policies provide for coverage of\n\nlitigation or defense expenses far beyond the indemnification\n\nlimits of the policies, and courts have uniformly recognized the\n\nenforceability of such policy provisions.     See Gen. Accident\n\nIns. Co. of Am. v. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., 143 N.J. 462, 464\n\n(1996) (using the term \"cost-exclusive\" policies to mean the\n\nsame as our \"outside the limits\" policies).\n\n    We recognize that some of Judge Coburn's statements in his\n\noral decision of May 24, 2011, if applied to other types of\n\nliability coverage, may deviate from the expectations of\n\ninsureds who purchase \"outside the limits\" policies and pay\n\npremiums to cover all their litigation expenses.    But Judge\n\nCoburn was not addressing a typical insurance claim for a single\n\noccurrence and a single insurance policy.   He was deciding how\n\nthe allocation model established in Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\nWallace should apply to long-tail claims, with many primary and\n\nexcess policies covering years of loss, some of which did not\n\n\n\n\n                               38                           A-6240-10T1\n\fhave defined limits of coverage for defense costs.   As Judge\n\nCoburn stated in his decision, \"exhaustion may mean one thing in\n\none context [and] it may mean another thing in another context.\"\n\n    To allay some of the fears expressed by amicus curiae, the\n\nexhaustion decision in this case is closely tied to its facts.\n\nWe reach no general conclusion that an insurer's obligations to\n\ncover defense costs and other litigation expenses through an\n\n\"outside the limits\" policy is limited by the maximum amount of\n\nindemnification coverage provided in that policy.\n\n    In the context of crafting a fair though imprecise\n\nallocation model for long-tail claims, our Supreme Court has\n\nallowed that a policy term that is contrary to the model may\n\n\"drop[] out of the policy.\"   Spaulding Composites, supra, 176\n\nN.J. at 44.   It also suggested that policy terms that are\n\n\"inconsistent with the underlying methodology specifically\n\nadopted in [Owens-Illinois]\" may be displaced.   Benjamin Moore,\n\nsupra, 179 N.J. at 101.   We find no legal error in the trial\n\njudges' interpretation of the \"payment\" provision of the\n\n\"outside the limits\" policies and their reliance on the\n\nsupervening effect of the Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace\n\nallocation methodology.\n\n    Challenging the final allocation judgment on a separate\n\nground, IMO argues that the payments from TIG that were not\n\n\n\n\n                                39                           A-6240-10T1\n\freimbursed by Transamerica were paid out of the direct policies\n\npre-dating 1972 and should not be attributed to the fronting\n\npolicies from 1977 to 1986.    According to IMO, Judge Coburn\n\ndeviated from Judge Muir's decision in transferring payments\n\nacross policy years, resulting in Judge Coburn's finding that\n\nTIG had overpaid its obligations by $15.2 million rather than\n\nthe approximately $2.27 million that Judge Muir found.\n\n    Judge Muir's legal conclusion, however, was not as IMO\n\nclaims.   In responding to IMO's contention that TIG payments\n\nreimbursed by Transamerica should not be credited to TIG's\n\nallocations, Judge Muir concluded that Transamerica's payments\n\nwere equally applicable for TIG's exhaustion purposes as were\n\nTIG's unreimbursed payments.    He stated:\n\n          [W]ho made the payments to IMO [was]\n          irrelevant, just as it would be if TIG went\n          out and borrowed money to make the payments.\n          That the payments were made and were\n          received by IMO as part of the Fronting\n          Policy indemnity duty is the only issue of\n          concern. I reject any adverse inferences\n          IMO projects from the fact Transamerica made\n          payments.\n\n    But Judge Muir did not limit the transfer of overpayments\n\non TIG policies to the years that the fronting policies were in\n\neffect.   The final allocation schedule adopted by the court\n\nshowed some of TIG's policies individually overpaid and others\n\nindividually underpaid.   Judge Coburn carried forward to\n\n\n\n\n                                 40                         A-6240-10T1\n\fadditional calculations Judge Muir's conclusion that overpaid\n\nyears could be shifted to underpaid years and that IMO should\n\nnot be permitted to retain the total overpayment once the\n\nallocation schedule was complete and the entirety of TIG's\n\nobligations was determined.\n\n    TIG's payments totaled more than $30 million.     Although\n\nsome of those payments are attributable to the pre-1972 direct\n\npolicies, more than $15 million, according to Judge Muir's\n\nfindings and more than $13 million according to Judge Coburn's\n\nfindings based on a revised allocation schedule, were\n\nattributable to TIG's fronting policies.   There is no dispute\n\nthat TIG made payments that exceeded the aggregate of its Owens-\n\nIllinois and Carter-Wallace allocations.   So, we can say its\n\npolicies were exhausted not just by allocation, but by\n\nallocation combined with payments that exceeded the total amount\n\nallocated to TIG.\n\n    We also reject IMO's argument that such retrospective\n\nshifting of payments across coverage years violates the holding\n\nof Carter-Wallace that prohibits horizontal distribution of\n\nlosses over several policy years.   That holding pertains to a\n\ndifferent question, whether all primary insurance policies over\n\nthe range of coverage years have to be exhausted before the\n\ncoverage obligations of any excess policies attach.    Carter-\n\n\n\n\n                               41                           A-6240-10T1\n\fWallace, supra, 154 N.J. at 324-25.   That holding is not\n\napplicable to the exhaustion decision in this case.\n\n    A contrary conclusion on shifting of payments among\n\ncoverage years might provide an incentive for an insurer not to\n\npay claims promptly on the chance that a future development in\n\nthe law, or the discovery of additional policies and additional\n\nresponsible insurers, results in a lesser obligation.   When TIG,\n\nacting alone or in conjunction with Aetna and NJM, paid for\n\nIMO's defense expenses in full under the IFAs through 2003, it\n\ndid so without a concession that its payments were the correct\n\namount of its allocated responsibility and without waiving a\n\nright to claim credits when a final allocation was determined.\n\n    As a result of Judge Muir's and Judge Coburn's decisions,\n\ndefense costs are allocated to TIG's fronting policies in\n\ngeneral conformity with the risks transferred to those policies.\n\nOnce the indemnity limits of the fronting policies were reached\n\nby allocation, and the prior aggregate payments from TIG\n\nexceeded those allocations, TIG's coverage was exhausted.     The\n\nalternative, that TIG's responsibility for defense costs would\n\nremain open indefinitely, would contradict the mandate of Owens-\n\nIllinois requiring allocation proportionate to the risks\n\ntransferred to the insurer.   The trial court correctly construed\n\n\n\n\n                                42                          A-6240-10T1\n\fthe \"payment\" language in the \"outside the limits\" policies in\n\nthe context of an Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation.\n\n    IMO further contends that the trial judges ignored the\n\ninsurers' contemporaneous conduct in performing their\n\nobligations under the policies.     It contends that TIG and\n\nTransamerica made payments for seventeen years after the 1986\n\ndivestiture because they understood their obligations to do so\n\nunder their contracts with IMO.     We reject this argument, too.\n\n    It hinges on a spreadsheet prepared by a representative of\n\nTransamerica, which shows that the policies were overpaid in the\n\naggregate but not all the individual fronting policies had\n\nsufficient losses allocated to exhaust them outright.     Judge\n\nMuir rejected the probative value of the spreadsheet as both\n\ninaccurate in its figures and ultimately immaterial to an Owens-\n\nIllinois and Carter-Wallace allocation.    We defer to the judge's\n\nrejection of that evidence as evaluated in the context of the\n\nfull record.   See Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co.,\n\n65 N.J. 474, 483-84 (1974).\n\n    TIG made payments in good faith pursuant to the IFAs.         At\n\nthe time of TIG's payments, allocation pursuant to Owens-\n\nIllinois and Carter-Wallace had not been mandated or was not\n\nattempted yet in this matter.     The overpayments resulted from\n\nongoing development of the law fixing the responsibilities of\n\n\n\n\n                                  43                           A-6240-10T1\n\fthe many insurers on the risk.    The fact that the timing of\n\nTIG's payments failed to coincide with loss allocations as\n\ncalculated later was simply an accident of the development of\n\nthe pertinent law.\n\n    It was also a product of IMO's refusal to allow a Carter-\n\nWallace allocation at an earlier time to replace the IFAs.       If\n\nthe court were to decrease IMO's and the excess insurers'\n\nliability for defense costs at TIG's expense, it would distort\n\nthe parties' relative share of liability in a manner that does\n\nnot accurately reflect the degree of risk each assumed.\n\n    In addition, IMO's \"running spigot\" theory contradicts the\n\ndictates of Owens-Illinois and would afford IMO an impermissible\n\ndouble recovery of some defense costs already borne by its\n\nprimary insurers pursuant to the IFAs.    In this case, producing\n\na proper allocation pursuant to Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\nWallace requires that the fronting policies be construed to have\n\nbeen exhausted by allocation and aggregate payment by TIG that\n\nexceeded the policy limits.\n\n    Finally, Transamerica and TIG offer as an alternative\n\nground for affirmance of the exhaustion issue that IMO should be\n\nbarred from raising its \"running spigot\" theory by the doctrine\n\nof unclean hands.    That doctrine permits the court to refuse\n\nequitable relief to a \"wrongdoer with respect to the subject\n\n\n\n\n                                 44                         A-6240-10T1\n\fmatter of the suit,\" specifically where the party is \"guilty of\n\nbad faith . . . in the underlying transaction.\"      Pellitteri v.\n\nPellitteri, 266 N.J. Super. 56, 65 (App. Div. 1993).     Thus, a\n\ncourt may refuse to hear the wrongdoer's argument, even if\n\notherwise meritorious, in the interest of equity and justice.\n\nGoodwin Motor Corp. v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc., 172 N.J.\n\nSuper. 263, 271 (App. Div. 1980).      Application of the doctrine\n\nlies within the trial court's discretion.      Pellitteri, supra,\n\n266 N.J. Super. at 65.\n\n    Because IMO had previously insisted that TIG adhere to its\n\nobligations under the IFAs rather than determine its obligations\n\npursuant to the Carter-Wallace methodology, Judge Muir invoked\n\nthe doctrine of unclean hands to bar IMO from contesting the\n\nshifting of overpayments to TIG's underpaid policies when IMO\n\npursued a Carter-Wallace allocation in this litigation.      The\n\njudge stated IMO could not reverse course after it filed suit\n\nand take the position that the IFA payments were voluntarily\n\nmade by TIG and Transamerica and could not be used as credits\n\nfor underpaid years.     We agree with the Transamerica defendants\n\nthat the unclean hands doctrine also supports affirmance of\n\nJudge Muir's exhaustion decision.\n\n    In sum, Judge Muir correctly determined that payments by or\n\non behalf of a single insurer could be shifted from one policy\n\n\n\n\n                                  45                         A-6240-10T1\n\fyear to another to determine exhaustion, and that the TIG\n\nfronting policies were exhausted by the end of 2003.   In\n\naddition, Judge Coburn's final judgment, which deemed the\n\nfronting policies exhausted by allocation rather than by payment\n\non specific policies, was consistent with the dictates of Owens-\n\nIllinois.\n\n                               III.\n\n                                  A.\n\n             Coverage Limits of Multi-Year Policies\n\n    On cross-appeals, ACE, LMI, and TIG allege error in the\n\ntreatment of multi-year policies in the allocation schedule.\n\nThey contend that the plain language of their multi-year\n\npolicies mandates that a single coverage limit for the entire\n\nterm of the policy should have been used in the allocation\n\nschedule rather than the full coverage limit for each year the\n\npolicy was in effect.   They contend there was no basis for\n\nrelying on extrinsic evidence to interpret the policies, and the\n\ntrial court's acceptance of annualized application of the\n\ncoverage limits results in multiplying the coverage that IMO\n\npurchased by the number of years the policies were in effect.\n\nACE and LMI Multi-Year Policies\n\n    ACE and LMI challenge Judge Muir's adoption of the SAM's\n\nruling imposing annual occurrence limits on their multi-year\n\n\n\n\n                                  46                        A-6240-10T1\n\fexcess policies.   ACE contends that policies it issued for\n\nNovember 1, 1959, to May 1, 1961; for January 1, 1974, to\n\nJanuary 1, 1977; and for September 1, 1974, to January 1, 1977,\n\nprovide a single per-occurrence limit for the duration of each\n\npolicy.   LMI similarly contends that its multi-year policies\n\nissued during 1967 to 1976 contain single per-occurrence limits.\n\nThe language addressing the limits of liability differs among\n\nthe policies, but each establishes a liability limit for each\n\noccurrence (or accident) and sets forth an aggregate limit for\n\neach annual period.\n\n    IMO does not dispute that the plain language of the\n\npolicies would impose per-occurrence limits on a term rather\n\nthan annual basis, but it sought a blanket ruling that every\n\nyear of a multi-year policy should be treated as if a separate\n\nannual limit is available for asbestos claims.\n\n    The SAM noted that Owens-Illinois did not resolve this\n\nissue and that the Supreme Court granted discretion to the\n\nmaster appointed by the trial court to develop a formula that\n\nfairly reflects the risks transferred to insurers or assumed by\n\nthe insured.

The\n\njudge observed:\n\n            Owens-Illinois undergirded its methodology\n            with the premise that when progressive\n            indivisible injury results from exposure to\n            injurious conditions courts may reasonably\n            treat the progressive injury \"as an\n            occurrence within each of the years of a\n            [comprehensive general liability] policy.\"\n            [138 N.J. at 478.] The single occurrence\n            for multi-year CGL policies contravenes that\n            premise and accordingly is unenforceable.\n\nWe agree and affirm the judge's decision.\n\n    First, we note that the cases upon which ACE and LMI rely,\n\nDiamond Shamrock Chemical Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co.,\n\n258 N.J. Super. 167 (App. Div. 1992), certif. denied, 134 N.J.\n\n481 (1993), and two unpublished decisions of this court, are not\n\non point.    Diamond Shamrock predates Owens-Illinois and was\n\ndecided under the laws of New York.    Id. at 222-23.   As to the\n\nother cases, in addition to being unpublished opinions with no\n\nprecedential value, R. 1:36-3, they were also decided under the\n\nlaws of other states.    These cases do not answer the question of\n\nwhether provisions in policies that apply a single occurrence\n\n\n\n\n                                 48                         A-6240-10T1\n\flimit over multi-year terms contravene the dictates of Owens-\n\nIllinois.\n\n    In Chemical Leaman, supra, 978 F. Supp. at 607-08, the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey\n\napplied Owens-Illinois to the question of multi-year occurrence\n\nlimits.   The court stated that the proper construction of Owens-\n\nIllinois was to \"direct treatment of progressive property damage\n\nas distinct occurrences triggering per-occurrence limits in each\n\nyear of a policy.\"   Id. at 607.    It noted that a precedential\n\nCalifornia case, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. v. Aetna\n\nCasualty & Surety Co., 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 35 (Ct. App. 1993),\n\nreview granted and opinion superseded sub nom. In re Asbestos\n\nInsurance Coverage Cases, 866 P.2d 1311 (Cal. 1994), was\n\ndiscussed favorably in Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 451,\n\n455, 475.    The United States District Court quoted Armstrong\n\nWorld Industries as follows with regard to the proper allocation\n\nmethod for multi-year policies:\n\n            \"This Court finds that the most equitable\n            method of allocation is proration on the\n            basis of policy limits, multiplied by years\n            of coverage. This method is consistent with\n            the policy language in that it takes policy\n            limits into consideration . . . This method\n            also reflects the fact that higher premiums\n            are generally paid for higher 'per person'\n            or 'per occurrence' limits. Since some\n            policies are in effect for more than one\n            year, and injury occurs during every year\n            from first exposure until death . . .\n\n\n\n                                   49                       A-6240-10T1\n\f            [m]ultiplying the policy limits by years of\n            coverage results in a more equitable\n            allocation than proration based on policy\n            limits alone.\"\n\n            [Chemical Leaman, supra, 978 F.

It agreed with the commentary in Barry R. Ostrager &\n\nThomas R. Newman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes Â§ 9.04\n\n(7th ed. 1994), that the decision of the California court in\n\nArmstrong World Industries supports payment of per-occurrence\n\nlimits for each year of a multi-year policy.      Chemical Leaman,\n\nsupra, 978 F. Supp. at 608.    Accordingly, it found that the\n\ninsurance policies at issue in that case with terms greater than\n\none year were \"liable up to their respective per-occurrence\n\nlimits for a separate occurrence during each triggered policy\n\nyear in which they were on the risk.\"     Ibid.\n\n       We implicitly endorsed the holding of Chemical Leaman in\n\nUnited States Mineral Products Co. v. American Insurance Co.,\n\n348 N.J. Super. 526, 545-46 (App. Div. 2002), a case that\n\npertained to the issue of policy extensions, not multi-year\n\npolicies.    Id. at 529.   More generally, we stated, \"[I]t is\n\nclear that underpinning the [Supreme] Court's allocation method\n\n\n\n\n                                  50                         A-6240-10T1\n\fis acceptance of the proposition that losses in an environmental\n\ndamages case must be treated as an occurrence in each of the\n\nperiods covered by a comprehensive general liability policy.\"\n\nId. at 550.\n\n    Were it not for the pro-rata methodology adopted in Owens-\n\nIllinois, each asbestos claim filed against IMO that triggered\n\nthe ACE and LMI policies would be treated as a separate\n\noccurrence subject to the per-occurrence limit for the entire\n\nmulti-year terms of the policies.      The aggregate limits of the\n\npolicies would control the insurers' total liability on the\n\nclaims.   Owens-Illinois changed the ground rules and classified\n\nall asbestos claims made in a year as a single occurrence.      If\n\nall three years were to be viewed as a single occurrence, the\n\ninsured would be deprived of the annual aggregate limits of the\n\npolicies.     Because the imposition of per-occurrence limits in\n\nmulti-year policies contravenes the goals of the pro-rata\n\nmethodology established in Owens-Illinois, such limits are\n\nunenforceable as specifically written.\n\n    Judge Muir's decision adopting annualized application of\n\nthe per-occurrence limits of the ACE and LMI multi-year policies\n\nis a fairer allocation of the risks transferred and assumed by\n\nthose policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                  51                         A-6240-10T1\n\fTIG Multi-Year Policy\n\n    TIG challenges the grant of summary judgment to IMO as to\n\nthe proper interpretation of a three-year policy it issued in\n\nthe 1960s.   Specifically, TIG contends that the $2.5-million\n\naggregate limit for bodily injury liability should have been\n\napplied for the full three-year period, not separately for each\n\npolicy year.\n\n    IMO initially presented the issue to the special discovery\n\nmaster (\"SDM\") appointed for this litigation, a different\n\nindividual from the SAM.   The SDM ruled that the policy language\n\nwas ambiguous in regard to an annual aggregate limit or a single\n\nlimit for the entire three-year period of the policy.     He\n\nfurther ruled that the only available extrinsic evidence bearing\n\non the policy's interpretation was so one-sided in favor of\n\nIMO's position as to justify the conclusion that the $2.5\n\nmillion aggregate limit applied separately in each policy year.\n\nThe trial court subsequently adopted the SDM's ruling.\n\n    The relevant facts are that TIG issued a policy that ran\n\nfrom July 1, 1967, to July 1, 1970.   The policy provided bodily\n\ninjury coverage under its Coverage A designation and property\n\ndamage coverage under its Coverage B designation.   The\n\ndeclarations page described Coverage A as having an aggregate\n\nproducts liability limit of $2.5 million and Coverage B as\n\n\n\n\n                                52                             A-6240-10T1\n\fhaving limits of $500,000 each for aggregate products,\n\noperations, protective, and contractual liabilities.\n\n    Section 6 of the policy, which addressed products liability\n\nCoverages A and B, provided that, \"[s]ubject to the limit of\n\nliability with respect to 'each occurrence' the limits of bodily\n\ninjury liability and property damage liability stated in the\n\nDeclarations as 'aggregate products' are respectively the total\n\nlimits of the Company's liability for all damages arising out of\n\nthe products hazard.\"   Section 7, which addressed operations,\n\nprotective, and contractual liability under Coverage B, used\n\nsimilar language to delineate the boundaries of those coverages,\n\nbut explicitly added in a final, isolated sentence that\n\n\"[a]ggregate limits of liability as stated in the Declarations\n\nshall apply separately to each annual period\" (emphasis added).\n\nIMO argues that this last-quoted provision creates an ambiguity\n\nand that TIG's own representatives treated the $2.5 million\n\nlimit as applying annually rather than as a total limit for all\n\nthree years of the policy.\n\n    In response, TIG cites Chubb Custom Insurance Co. v.\n\nPrudential Insurance Company of America, 195 N.J. 231, 238\n\n(2008), among other case law, and argues there is no ambiguity\n\nin the policy and thus the court may not resort to extrinsic\n\nevidence to interpret it.    TIG contends Section 6 of the policy\n\n\n\n\n                                 53                        A-6240-10T1\n\fis applicable to coverage for bodily injury claims arising out\n\nof exposure to asbestos and that section's silence with respect\n\nto annual coverage limits, together with Section 7's explicit\n\nprovision for separate annual limits for property damage, is\n\nclear policy language that can only be interpreted to limit the\n\npolicy's total aggregate limit for the three years to $2.5\n\nmillion.   According to TIG, the trial court's unwarranted\n\ninterpretation increased the aggregate limit to $7.5 million.\n\n    There is support in the case law for TIG's argument that a\n\nmulti-year policy should not be interpreted as having annual\n\ncoverage limits unless the language of the policy provides such\n\nlimits.    See Diamond Shamrock, supra, 258 N.J. Super. at 224-25;\n\nCSX Transp., Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 82 F.3d 478, 483\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996); Soc'y of the Roman Catholic Church of the\n\nDiocese of Lafayette & Lake Charles, Inc. v. Interstate Fire &\n\nCas. Co., 26 F.3d 1359, 1366 (5th Cir. 1994); Hercules, Inc. v.\n\nAIU Ins. Co., 784 A.2d 481, 495-96 (Del. 2001).    But, again,\n\nthese cases were not applying the Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\nWallace allocation methodology.\n\n    We do not find legal error in the SDM's and the trial\n\ncourt's conclusion that the policy at issue here was\n\nsufficiently ambiguous that resort to extrinsic evidence should\n\nbe employed to interpret it.   The representatives of TIG who had\n\n\n\n\n                                  54                         A-6240-10T1\n\fresponsibility for implementing the policy invariably applied an\n\nannual $2.5 million aggregate limit in their handling of\n\npertinent claims and in other communications.\n\n    TIG argues that the actions of those employees were not\n\nrelevant to interpreting the policy because they were not\n\ninvolved in drafting or issuing the policy in 1967.     They were\n\nadministering the terms of the policy some thirty years later\n\nwithout ever having reviewed the clear limitations language of\n\nthe policy.   The limitations language of the policy, however, is\n\nnot as clear as TIG claims, and TIG had no witness to contradict\n\nthe interpretation that its own representatives placed on the\n\nmulti-year policy.\n\n    We do not find reversible error in the trial court's\n\nruling.   The court's application of an annual aggregate limit\n\nfor bodily injury to each year of TIG's multi-year policy was\n\nconsistent with the Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation\n\nmethodology, and we will not disturb that ruling on appeal.\n\n                                B.\n\n              \"Stub Policies\" (Partial-Year Coverage)\n\n    The ACE defendants claim that the coverage limit of a \"stub\n\npolicy,\" that is, a policy issued or extended for only part of a\n\nyear, should be pro-rated.   They assert that assigning the full\n\npolicy limit for purposes of the Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\n\n\n\n                                55                          A-6240-10T1\n\fWallace methodology unfairly allows the insured to increase the\n\nliability limits for which it paid a premium.    We disagree.\n\n    An ACE policy in effect from February 13, 1976, to January\n\n1, 1977, provides umbrella liability coverage to a limit of $1\n\nmillion for each occurrence, and $1 million annual aggregate.\n\nACE contends its coverage limit should be pro-rated to reflect\n\nthe time on the risk, which would be eleven-twelfths (or 0.9167)\n\nof $1 million.\n\n    The SAM found that policies issued or extended for a term\n\nof less than one year should be treated for purposes of the\n\nallocation as having a separate annual aggregate limit that will\n\nbe in place for the term of the shortened policy period.    Judge\n\nMuir adopted the SAM's report and recommendation.\n\n    In United States Mineral Products, supra, 348 N.J. Super.\n\nat 536-37, we reasoned that an insured who paid a pro-rated\n\npremium for an additional two weeks of coverage on an excess\n\npolicy identical to that provided by the initial policy would\n\nexpect that such a premium reflected only the insurer's reduced\n\ntime on the risk, not a reduction of the policy's aggregate\n\nlimits.   We concluded that the stub policy created an additional\n\nset of aggregate limits that were available to the insured for\n\nthe term of the policy.   Id. at 550.   Treating a stub policy as\n\nproviding a pro-rated limit would result in the loss allocated\n\n\n\n\n                                56                         A-6240-10T1\n\fto the policy being reduced twice, once by its time on the risk\n\nand a second time by the pro-rating of the policy limit.\n\n       Our holding in United States Mineral Products is clear.     If\n\nthe annual aggregate limits of a stub policy are to be pro-\n\nrated, specific language in the policy must so provide.      Id. at\n\n559.   Nothing in the ACE policy indicates that the annual\n\naggregate limits are pro-rated.\n\n       Judge Muir did not err in attributing the full policy limit\n\nto the ACE policy for the period of time it insured the risk.\n\n                                  C.\n\n               SIRs as Outside the Limits of Policies\n\n       ACE contends that the trial court erred in determining that\n\nIMO's payment of its SIR obligations was outside the coverage\n\nlimits of ACE policies.\n\n       ACE issued two excess umbrella policies to Transamerica and\n\nits subsidiaries, which were in effect from January 1, 1976,\n\nthrough April 1, 1979.    They provided a $1,000,000 limit of\n\ncoverage, and also stated:\n\n           $500,000 Combined Annual Aggregate That\n           Would Otherwise Be Recoverable Hereunder\n           Shall Be Retained by the Insured in Addition\n           to the Underlying Set Forth Above.\n\n       ACE sought a ruling that the limits of the policies were\n\neroded by IMO's retention of $500,000.    The SAM issued a written\n\nreport and recommendation concluding that the $1 million annual\n\n\n\n                                  57                         A-6240-10T1\n\flimits are not eroded by the retention.   He noted that \"[i]t is\n\nlong standing custom and practice in the insurance industry to\n\ndistinguish between deductibles and self insured retentions.\"\n\nWhile the limits of a policy are reduced by a deductible, they\n\nremain intact in the case of a self-insured retention.     The SAM\n\nrejected ACE's argument that the phrase \"that would otherwise be\n\nrecoverable\" as quoted from the policy demonstrated an intention\n\nthat the $500,000 \"retention\" would be deducted from the\n\ncoverage limits.\n\n    The SAM also observed that ACE's position was weakened by\n\nits past course of conduct.   It had paid its full $1 million\n\nlimit for claims occurring during the 1977-78 policy period.\n\nMoreover, an ACE claims adjuster stated in a 1980 status report\n\nthat the policy limits were \"in excess of a self insured\n\nretention of the insured of $500,000 each occurrence plus an\n\nannual aggregate of an additional $500,000 which can be utilized\n\nonly once per year.\"   The SAM found that the adjustor's\n\n\"interpretation of the clause is entirely logical and consistent\n\nwith the reading of the endorsements whereby the word 'retained'\n\nis given the standard meaning denoting a self insured retention,\n\nas commonly understood in the insurance industry.\"\n\n    Judge Muir adopted the SAM's ruling and denied ACE's motion\n\nfor summary judgment with respect to this issue.   The final\n\n\n\n\n                                58                          A-6240-10T1\n\fjudgment allocated a total of $1 million each to the two ACE\n\npolicies.\n\n    Although the SAM found that the distinction between a\n\ndeductible and a SIR is \"black letter insurance law,\" the issue\n\nappears not to have been directly addressed by a New Jersey\n\ncourt.    In fact, we have in the past observed that \"[o]ur courts\n\nappear to have used the terms self-insured retention and\n\ndeductible interchangeably.\"     Moore v. Nayer, 321 N.J. Super.\n\n419, 438-39 (App. Div. 1999), appeal dismissed, 164 N.J. 187\n\n(2000).   However, because Moore was addressing co-insurance and\n\ndid not consider the effect of deductibles or SIRs on policy\n\nlimits, it is not controlling on this issue.\n\n    New Jersey courts have recognized that an insured's\n\ndeductible erodes the policy limits.    See Benjamin Moore, supra,\n\n179 N.J. at 105-06; cf. Am. Nurses Ass'n v. Passaic Gen. Hosp.,\n\n98 N.J. 83, 88-89 (1984) (explaining why a deductible does not\n\nconstitute \"other insurance\").    On the other hand, federal\n\ncourts have stated clearly that a SIR does not reduce the limits\n\nof an insurance policy.    In In re September 11th Liability\n\nInsurance Coverage Cases, 333 F. Supp. 2d 111, 124 n.7 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2003), the United States District Court explained the\n\ndistinction between SIRs and deductibles:\n\n            A SIR differs from a deductible in that a\n            SIR is an amount that an insured retains and\n\n\n\n                                  59                        A-6240-10T1\n\f           covers before insurance coverage begins to\n           apply. Once a SIR is satisfied, the insurer\n           is then liable for amounts exceeding the\n           retention, less any agreed deductible.\n           Barry R. Ostrager & Thomas R. Newman,\n           Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes\n           Â§ 13.13[a] (12th ed. vol.2, 2004). . . .\n           In contrast, a deductible is an amount that\n           an insurer subtracts from a policy amount,\n           reducing the amount of insurance.

Judge Muir relied on language in Owens-\n\nIllinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 477, prohibiting the insurers in\n\nthat case from re-litigating already-settled claims after\n\n\n\n\n                                  61                         A-6240-10T1\n\frefusing to defend them.   We agree with that decision.   Allowing\n\nexcess insurers to contest coverage is not feasible for long-\n\ntail, multi-claim coverage cases and would compromise the\n\nallocation methodology mandated by the Supreme Court.\n\n    Ordinarily, the insured \"bears the burden of establishing\n\nthat a claim lies within [a] policy's scope of coverage.\"\n\nShaler ex rel. Shaler v. Toms River Obstetrics & Gynecology\n\nAssocs., 383 N.J. Super. 650, 662 (App. Div.), certif. denied,\n\n187 N.J. 82 (2006).   ACE and LMI argued from the outset that IMO\n\nmust satisfy its burden of establishing that claims it had paid\n\nwere covered under the terms of the ACE and LMI policies.\n\n    Judge Muir first observed that IMO and the insurers that\n\nhad participated in its defense had adopted reasonable\n\nprocedures for settling only claims for which IMO potentially\n\nfaced liability.    At the time of that observation, about 75,000\n\nasbestos-related claims had been filed against IMO, of which IMO\n\nhad settled approximately 15,000 and obtained dismissal of about\n\n30,000.   IMO began to notify the excess insurers of the claims\n\nin 1989 and offered to make its claim files available to them\n\nfor inspection.    Meanwhile, the excess insurers declined to\n\ninvolve themselves in defense of the claims.   They chose their\n\ncourse of action although they had the right, explicitly stated\n\nin their policies, to associate in the defense.    Judge Muir\n\n\n\n\n                                 62                         A-6240-10T1\n\fconsidered this \"continuing indifference\" to be \"tantamount to a\n\nrefusal [by the excess insurers] to involve themselves in\n\npresented-claims defense.\"\n\n    A primary insurer that refuses its obligation to defend\n\nclaims against its insured without first timely challenging\n\ncoverage forfeits the right to hold an insured to that burden at\n\na later time.   Griggs v. Bertram, 88 N.J. 347, 363-64 (1982).\n\nExcess insurers, on the other hand, generally have no duty to\n\nparticipate in the defense and may rely on the good faith of the\n\nprimary insurer in settling claims against the insured.     CNA\n\nIns. Co. v. Selective Ins. Co., 354 N.J. Super. 369, 383-84\n\n(App. Div. 2002).\n\n    In Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 477, the Court\n\ndistinguished long-tail coverage cases from the norm in the\n\ninsured's burden of proving coverage for each claim.    It stated:\n\n         Because the defendants refused to involve\n         themselves in the defense of the claims as\n         presented, they should be bound by the facts\n         set forth in plaintiff's own records with\n         respect to the dates of exposure and with\n         respect to the amounts of settlements and\n         defense costs. Those losses for indemnity\n         and defense costs should be allocated\n         promptly among the companies in accordance\n         with the mathematical model developed,\n         subject to policy limits and exclusions. We\n         stress that there can be no relitigation of\n         those settled claims.\n\n         [(Citation omitted and emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n\n                                63                          A-6240-10T1\n\f    Judge Muir understood this last directive of the Court as\n\napplying with equal force to primary and excess insurers to bar\n\nthem from contesting coverage of claims.   He stated that Owens-\n\nIllinois was a watershed decision delineating \"the response\n\nrequired of excess insurers to their insureds' liability for\n\nasbestos related injuries sustained over decades,\" and,\n\nmoreover, that it was a \"critical point that divides past case\n\nlaw principles from its doctrines.\"\n\n    Applying the language used by the Supreme Court in Owens-\n\nIllinois, Judge Muir concluded that where insurers, primary or\n\nexcess, \"refused\" to avail themselves of the right to associate\n\nin defense of claims against the insured, they \"should be bound\n\nby facts set forth in the insureds' records with respect to\n\namounts of settlements and defense costs\" and could not\n\notherwise \"relitigate the settled claims.\"\n\n    ACE and LMI contend they have a right as excess insurers\n\nbut no affirmative duty to associate in IMO's defense.    They add\n\nthat Owens-Illinois neither imposed any such duty nor otherwise\n\nlimited the right of excess insurers to demand that their\n\ninsured bear its normal burden of establishing coverage for each\n\nclaim made against their policies.\n\n    As this court's underlying opinion in Owens-Illinois noted,\n\nboth primary and excess policies were involved in that case.\n\n\n\n\n                               64                           A-6240-10T1\n\fOwens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co., 264 N.J. Super. 460,\n\n467, 477 (App. Div. 1993), rev'd in part, 138 N.J. 437 (1994).\n\nThe Supreme Court did not explicitly condition its directive\n\nprohibiting re-litigation of coverage issues to the primary\n\ninsurers' affirmative duty to defend.       Rather, the Court stated:\n\n\"In future cases, insurers aware of their responsibility under\n\nthe continuing-trigger theory might minimize their costs by\n\nassuming responsibility for or involving themselves in the\n\ndefense of the actions . . . .\"    Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J.\n\nat 478 (emphasis added).\n\n    It stands to reason that accommodating a challenge to\n\ncoverage in tens of thousands of individual claims would not\n\nonly prove daunting but would compromise the integrity of the\n\nframework Owens-Illinois offers for efficient and equitable\n\nallocation of losses among policies.      As we have stated, policy\n\nterms and traditional principles applicable to ordinary coverage\n\nlitigation must bend insofar as they conflict with application\n\nof the Owens-Illinois framework.       Benjamin Moore, supra, 179\n\nN.J. at 104.   The Court could thus impose a greater obligation\n\non the part of excess insurers than specifically stated in their\n\npolicies to participate in the insured's defense, or risk losing\n\nthe right to challenge coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n                                  65                          A-6240-10T1\n\f    Nor is our conclusion inequitable.   IMO put the excess\n\ninsurers on notice of the thousands of claims against it, and\n\nOwens-Illinois put them on notice of the necessity of\n\nparticipating in order to preserve their right to challenge\n\ncoverage determinations.\n\n    The trial court appropriately gave effect to a plainly\n\nstated directive of Owens-Illinois â€” that insurers who have\n\ndeclined to associate in the defense of claims against the\n\ninsured may be precluded from later challenging coverage.\n\n                                  B.\n\n                 Duty to Defend Uncovered Claims\n\n    ACE argues that the court erred in determining that defense\n\ncosts incurred by IMO in connection with uncovered asbestos\n\nclaims are recoverable under policies that limit defense\n\nreimbursement to costs paid as a consequence of a covered\n\noccurrence.   ACE contends the majority of its policies are\n\nultimate net loss policies that only obligate it to indemnify\n\nIMO where IMO itself becomes obligated by adjudication or\n\ncompromise to pay for a covered occurrence.   Relying on case law\n\nfrom other jurisdictions, ACE maintains that courts interpreting\n\nsimilar policy language have held that the duty to indemnify\n\ndefense costs arises only when the costs are incurred in\n\nconnection with covered claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                  66                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    LMI advances the same argument, although its policies\n\ndiffer from the ACE policies.   However, both excess insurers'\n\npolicies use the same definition of ultimate net loss.   LMI\n\nargues that the ultimate net loss provision makes the existence\n\nof an actually covered claim, and not just a potentially covered\n\nclaim, a prerequisite for indemnification of defense costs.     It\n\nasserts that requiring IMO to segregate defense costs and to\n\nidentify those utilized for actually covered claims would have\n\nno impact on the allocation process, and it would not be overly\n\ndifficult to apportion defense costs after the allocation is\n\ncompleted.\n\n    IMO responds that the excess insurers' policies promise to\n\npay for the costs of defending liabilities arising from covered\n\n\"occurrences,\" not covered \"claims.\"   It emphasizes that Owens-\n\nIllinois defines an \"occurrence\" to be the decision to\n\nmanufacture asbestos-containing products, not the exposure of a\n\nspecific claimant to an asbestos product.\n\n    IMO further asserts that the excess insurers have relied on\n\ncases that are not pertinent to the proper definition of\n\noccurrence, and that the differences between the law of New\n\nJersey and the law of New York and other states as to the nature\n\nof a covered occurrence distinguish the holdings of the case law\n\ncited by ACE and LMI.   IMO argues that the trial court's refusal\n\n\n\n\n                                67                         A-6240-10T1\n\fto parse defense costs between covered and uncovered claims\n\naccords with the realities of defending mass tort claims, where\n\nthe effective defense of meritless claims is part and parcel of\n\nthe defense of covered claims.\n\n    A representative provision of the many policies involved\n\nprovides that the insurer will indemnify the insured:\n\n         for all sums which the [in]sured shall be\n         obligated to pay by reason of the liability:\n         (a) imposed upon the [in]sured by law, or\n         (b) assumed under contract or agreement . .\n         . for damages on account of: (i) Personal\n         Injuries . . . caused by or arising out of\n         each occurrence . . . as defined in the\n         Underlying Umbrella Policies . . . .\n\n         [(Emphasis added).]\n\nA representative underlying policy covers damages and expenses\n\nfor the insured's \"ultimate net loss,\" which it defines as:\n\n         the total sum which the insured, or any\n         company as his insurer, or both becomes\n         obligated to pay by reason of personal\n         injury . . . either through adjudication or\n         compromise . . . expense for . . . lawyers .\n         . . and investigators and other persons and\n         for litigation, settlement, adjustment and\n         investigation of claims and suits which are\n         paid as a consequence of any occurrence\n         covered hereunder . . . .\n\n         [(Emphasis added).]\n\nThe excess insurers argue that the phrase \"be [or becomes]\n\nobligated to pay\" absolves them of paying for defending against\n\nclaims that are dismissed or adjudicated to be without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                 68                      A-6240-10T1\n\f    In a written report and recommendation dated March 27,\n\n2008, the SAM ruled that \"[t]he common straightforward reading\n\nof the language is that indemnification for defense related\n\nexpenses must be related to an occurrence.      If there is no\n\noccurrence then there can be no covered damages.\"      He observed\n\nthat New Jersey law defines the occurrence as IMO's decision to\n\nsell asbestos products, and concluded that all of IMO's defense\n\nexpenses flow from that decision.      He therefore recommended that\n\nthe court deny the excess insurers' motion and find that IMO is\n\nentitled to receive indemnity for all its defense expenses.\n\n    On the request of LMI and ACE for reconsideration, the SAM\n\nnoted: \"Mass-tort asbestos claims are defended very differently\n\nfrom the average claims,\" and some defendants choose to try\n\nquestionable cases to a conclusion in order to send a deterrent\n\nmessage to the plaintiffs' bar.    He also noted that applying\n\nLMI's and ACE's interpretation of an occurrence to each\n\nindividual claim would present a significant practical\n\nchallenge, in that it would impose an unworkable burden on IMO\n\nand require the expenditure of substantial judicial resources.\n\nHe added:\n\n            It is extremely difficult to see how\n            adjudicating LMI's policies' provision to\n            indemnify defense costs for only covered\n            claims would not hijack the allocation\n            process. While IMO should be required to\n            demonstrate that a claim does fall within a\n\n\n\n                                  69                         A-6240-10T1\n\f          given policy year, to require an evidentiary\n          process on thousands of claims to determine\n          their linkage to defense costs would be\n          unworkable and unmanageable. It would seem\n          extremely difficult to connect every defense\n          payment to a claim and to make a second\n          determination that the claim is, indeed, a\n          covered claim.\n\n    Judge Muir adopted the SAM's reasoning and ruling by an\n\norder dated November 4, 2009.\n\n    Both the excess policies and the underlying policies\n\nobligate the insurers to pay for damages arising out of an\n\n\"occurrence.\"   In Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 447, where\n\nthe insurers' policies had coverage and ultimate net loss\n\nprovisions virtually identical to those in this case, the Court\n\nrecited our conclusion that the manufacture and sale of the\n\nasbestos-containing product should be regarded as the single\n\noccurrence triggering liability for asbestos-related injuries or\n\ndamage.   Id. at 445-46 (citing Owens-Illinois, supra, 264 N.J.\n\nSuper. at 503).   Our opinion, in turn, had relied on the\n\nreasoning of the District Court in Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Aetna\n\nCasualty & Surety Co., 597 F. Supp. 1515, 1525 (D.D.C. 1984),\n\nwhich held that \"the number of injuries or claims, even if\n\ntemporally removed from their causes, are irrelevant when\n\ndetermining the number of occurrences.\"   See also In re\n\nIntegrity Ins. Co., 214 N.J. 51, 69-70 (2013) (the majority of\n\ncourts have adopted a \"cause test\" for defining \"occurrences\");\n\n\n\n                                70                          A-6240-10T1\n\fU.S. Mineral Prods., supra, 348 N.J. Super. at 542 (manufacture\n\nand sale of asbestos-containing product constitutes single\n\noccurrence triggering liability).\n\n    The same result must follow here in the context of proving\n\ncoverage for each individual claimant.    The excess insurers'\n\nobligation to cover IMO's ultimate net losses, which include\n\ndefense costs, was triggered when IMO manufactured and sold\n\nasbestos-containing products and claimants became injured by\n\nthose products.    IMO's decision to trade in such products\n\nresulted in IMO paying damages to claimants following litigation\n\nor settlement.    Under the terms of the excess insurance\n\npolicies, LMI and ACE are required to indemnify IMO for the sums\n\nit expended in defending all those claims.\n\n    The conclusion that the excess insurers must reimburse IMO\n\nfor defense costs even if some of them were incurred to defend\n\nuncovered claims is also compelled by another aspect of Owens-\n\nIllinois.   As the SAM noted, the need to segregate and classify\n\ndefense costs according to each individual claim would greatly\n\ncomplicate the already complex allocation process.    Challenges\n\namong the parties as to whether particular claims were covered\n\nor uncovered would increase litigation and require additional\n\njudicial attention.   The reason the Court developed the pro-rata\n\nmethodology was to reduce the litigation costs and judicial\n\n\n\n\n                                 71                           A-6240-10T1\n\finefficiencies attendant to resolving insurance coverage for\n\nlong-term environmental damages.       Owens-Illinois, supra, 138\n\nN.J. at 474.    Adopting the process that the excess insurers\n\nsuggest would directly contravene those objectives.\n\n    The unpublished and out-of-state decisions cited by the\n\nexcess insurers are not controlling.      None of them applies an\n\nanalysis based on the principles articulated in Owens-Illinois.\n\n    We affirm the trial court's ruling that defense costs are\n\nsubject to allocation even if a portion of them ultimately were\n\ndevoted to defending against claims that were determined not to\n\nbe covered under the insurance policies.\n\n                                  V.\n\n                         Denial of Jury Trial\n\n    IMO contends that the court erred in denying its demand for\n\na jury trial on the legal issues in the case for which it sought\n\nmoney damages.     More specifically, IMO argues that the court\n\nimproperly relied on the relief sought in IMO's original\n\ncomplaint.     It further argues that claims for future costs did\n\nnot predominate the Phase I and II trials, and that the court\n\nmisapplied the holding of Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. Liberty Mutual\n\nInsurance Co. (In re Environmental Insurance Declaratory\n\nJudgment Actions) (\"In re Environmental\"), 149 N.J. 278 (1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                  72                          A-6240-10T1\n\f    IMO sought a jury trial on its TARM and bad faith claims\n\nagainst the Transamerica defendants and on its bad faith denial\n\nof coverage claims against other insurers, for which it sought\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages.   The Transamerica defendants\n\nmoved to strike IMO's jury demand, arguing that IMO's claims\n\nwere predominately equitable, that all the claims that sought\n\nmoney damages were ancillary to IMO's declaratory judgment and\n\nspecific performance claims, and that relevant case law\n\nsupported dispensing with a jury in the complex circumstances of\n\nthis litigation.\n\n    Judge Muir reviewed the substance of the original complaint\n\nand each amended complaint filed by IMO.   He stated that the\n\nequitable or legal nature of a lawsuit is primarily determined\n\nby the remedies sought in the original complaint.   Cf. Mantell\n\nv. Int'l Plastic Harmonica Co., 141 N.J. Eq. 379, 383-89 (E. &\n\nA. 1947) (parties cannot amend a pleading to change the\n\njurisdiction of the court hearing the case).   Relying on the\n\nholdings of Mantell and Boardwalk Properties, Inc. v. BPHC\n\nAcquisitions, 253 N.J. Super. 515 (App. Div. 1991), the judge\n\ndetermined that IMO's predominant claims were for specific\n\nperformance in the future and for a declaration that defendant\n\ninsurers were obligated to provide coverage for future\n\n\n\n\n                               73                         A-6240-10T1\n\findemnification and defense costs.

Thus, the trial court's ruling may not be\n\ndisregarded if IMO had a right to a jury trial protected by our\n\nState Constitution.\n\n    IMO does not have a right to a jury trial unless such a\n\nright is in fact found in our State Constitution or in a\n\nstatute.

Ins. Co., 206 N.J. 562, 575 (2011).     How the\n\nparties classify the matter is irrelevant; the court must\n\nexamine the substance of the allegations and the relief sought.\n\nWood, supra, 206 N.J. at 576.\n\n    IMO alleges that its third amended complaint contained\n\nprominent and independent claims for money damages, which gave\n\nit a right to a jury trial.    It adds that some claims first made\n\nin the third amended complaint did not arise until six months\n\nafter the original complaint was filed, and those allegations\n\ncould not have been included in the original filing.     Therefore,\n\nit argues, Judge Muir should not have focused on the declaratory\n\nrelief IMO sought in its original complaint.\n\n    When equitable issues or defenses are presented, the matter\n\nof whether a jury trial should be granted is left to the\n\ndetermination of the judge.     Sun Coast Merch. Corp. v. Myron\n\nCorp., 393 N.J. Super. 55, 86-87 (App. Div. 2007), certif.\n\n\n\n\n                                  75                         A-6240-10T1\n\fdenied, 194 N.J. 270 (2008).    Pursuant to the doctrine of\n\nancillary jurisdiction, if a complaint presents a primarily\n\nequitable action but also includes causes of action at law, the\n\ncourt of equity can assume jurisdiction over the legal issues.\n\nWood, supra, 206 N.J. at 575.\n\n    In Lyn-Anna Properties v. Harborview Development Corp., 145\n\nN.J. 313 (1996), the Court held that the chancery court has\n\nancillary jurisdiction over legal issues to the extent that\n\nthose are \"incidental or essential to the determination of some\n\nequitable question.\"    Id. at 330 (quoting Shaw v. G.B. Beaumont\n\nCo., 88 N.J. Eq. 333, 336 (E. & A. 1917)).     When a complaint\n\nseeks both legal and equitable remedies, the court must consider\n\nthe nature of the controversy in addition to the requested\n\nrelief.   Id. at 331.   If the predominant relief is equitable,\n\nthen the legal issues are ancillary and may be decided in a\n\nbench trial.   Id. at 330.   If a legal claim is not incidental or\n\nessential to the predominant equitable remedy, then it should be\n\nsevered and transferred to the Law Division.     Ibid.\n\n    Furthermore, the court may strive to dispose of all matters\n\nin a controversy in a single action if it can do so without\n\nviolating a litigant's constitutional or statutory rights.\n\nMassari v. Einsiedler, 6 N.J. 303, 313 (1951).     In Boardwalk\n\nProperties, supra, 253 N.J. Super. at 526-27, we stated that the\n\n\n\n\n                                 76                           A-6240-10T1\n\fChancery Division can decide both legal and equitable issues and\n\nprovide appropriate remedies.   We also stated that matters\n\ntriable without a jury under the Constitution of 1844 are\n\nsimilarly triable without a jury under the Constitution of 1947.\n\nId. at 527-28.\n\n    When legal claims arise from controversies that are\n\nindependent of the equitable action, they should be tried\n\nseparately before a jury.   Ibid.; see, e.g., N.J. Highway Auth.\n\nv. Renner, 18 N.J. 485, 488-89 (1955).     The court should examine\n\nthe legal claims and determine if they are \"so intertwined with\n\nthe equitable issues that the legal issues\" fall within the\n\nequity court's jurisdiction to decide them without a jury.\n\nBoardwalk Properties, supra, 253 N.J. Super. at 528.\n\n    Here, the original complaint focused on declaratory relief,\n\nalthough it also included prayers for compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages.   Primarily, IMO sought the court's aid in defining and\n\nfixing the obligations of Transamerica and TIG in relation to\n\nthe 1986 Distribution Agreement.     The crux of the complaint was\n\nthe alleged \"imminent\" exhaustion of the TIG insurance policies.\n\nThe defense costs and indemnification payments that IMO sought\n\nwere in connection with pending or future asbestos cases.\n\n    The second amended complaint named several dozen excess\n\ninsurers, but IMO still sought the same declaration of rights as\n\n\n\n\n                                77                          A-6240-10T1\n\fits original complaint and, further, a declaration of rights of\n\nIMO and the obligations of Transamerica in connection with the\n\nexcess insurers.   For the most part, the asbestos claims in\n\ndispute were either ongoing or future claims.\n\n    The twenty-four counts of the third amended complaint did\n\nnot change the primary relief sought.    IMO's bad faith claims\n\nwere rooted in the alleged wrongful abandonment of its defense\n\nand the failure to notify IMO in advance that certain insurance\n\npolicies were about to be exhausted.    Again, IMO was concerned\n\nthat defendants failed or \"will fail\" to fulfill their\n\nobligations under the insurance contracts, and have refused or\n\n\"will refuse\" to defend and indemnify IMO against asbestos\n\nclaims filed in New Jersey and other states.\n\n    All of IMO's pleadings sought declarations about the future\n\nobligations of defendants.   Any alleged claims of bad faith,\n\nwrongful abandonment, breach of fiduciary duty, or tortious\n\ninterference stem from whether the contractual rights alleged by\n\nIMO in fact existed.   From the outset and throughout the\n\nlitigation, IMO's complaints were mainly equitable.\n\n    Although additional causes of action for money damages may\n\nhave arisen after the filing of the initial complaint, those\n\nclaims are still intertwined with the primary events and the\n\nallegations presented in the original complaint.    See Eckerd\n\n\n\n\n                                78                          A-6240-10T1\n\fDrugs of N.J., Inc. v. S.R. 215, Rite-Aid Corp., 170 N.J. Super.\n\n37, 42-43 (Ch. Div. 1979).   As we have stated, they are linked\n\nto the question of whether or not the Transamerica defendants\n\nand the excess insurers had an obligation to provide ongoing or\n\nfuture defense and indemnification, and an earlier notice of\n\nexhaustion.\n\n    IMO argues that none of its claims fell within the\n\nexceptions to the right to a jury trial as stated in In re\n\nEnvironmental, supra, 149 N.J. at 291-300.    In that case, the\n\nplaintiff was seeking a judgment declaring that the insurers\n\nwere required to indemnify and defend for future costs of an\n\nenvironmental remediation action.    Id. at 286.   The issue on\n\nappeal was whether a constitutional right to a jury trial\n\nexisted in a declaratory judgment action involving claims\n\nagainst insurers for breach of contract and recovery of future\n\ncosts where the plaintiff also sought compensatory damages for\n\npast costs.   Ibid.\n\n    The case was complex.    It involved dozens of insurance\n\ncompanies and estimated future costs that exceeded $1 billion.\n\nId. at 288-89.   The Supreme Court observed that the action was\n\nat its root a request for specific performance of the insurance\n\ncontracts because the plaintiff wished to be placed in the\n\nposition it would have enjoyed had the insurers performed on the\n\n\n\n\n                                79                          A-6240-10T1\n\finsurance contracts.    Id. at 293-95.    In addition, specific\n\nperformance was an appropriate remedy because several of the\n\nalleged breaches had not yet occurred, leaving the insured's\n\ndamages incalculable.     Id. at 296.   Therefore, the plaintiff did\n\nnot have a right to a jury trial.       Id. at 287, 295.   A court of\n\nequity could decide any ancillary legal issues and award money\n\ndamages for past losses.    Id. at 295.\n\n       Similarly in this case, there was no right to a jury trial\n\nbecause IMO's complaints presented a unique and complex mass-\n\ntort insurance coverage case focused on a declaration of the\n\nparties' rights and obligations and on the specific performance\n\nof insurance contracts as so declared.      In fact, the Court in In\n\nre Environmental observed that the predominance of equitable\n\nissues combined with the complexity of the subject matter\n\ndistinguished that case from other insurance actions.        Id. at\n\n298.   The same is true here.\n\n       IMO's breach of contract and bad faith claims grew out of\n\nthe same dispute and were intertwined with its equitable claims.\n\nThey were based on the same facts and proofs as the claims for\n\ndeclaratory judgment and specific performance.      They were\n\nproperly and economically adjudicated within the equity court's\n\nancillary jurisdiction.    Wood, supra, 206 N.J. at 575.\n\n\n\n\n                                  80                            A-6240-10T1\n\f    Additionally, this case is different from Ward v. Merrimack\n\nMutual Fire Insurance Co., 312 N.J. Super. 162, 167-69 (App.\n\nDiv. 1998), because Ward was a coverage case where the primary\n\nremedy sought was money for damages already incurred.   The\n\nplaintiff was not making claims for any future or ongoing\n\ninjury.   Ibid.\n\n    We conclude that Judge Muir did not err as a matter of law\n\nwhen he denied IMO's demand for a jury trial and decided the\n\nequitable matters and the ancillary legal issues by means of\n\nbench trials.\n\n\n    [At the court's direction, the remainder of this\n    opinion has been redacted for purposes of\n    publication.

Defendants are primary and excess liability insurers,\n\nas well as Transamerica Corporation, the former parent company\n\nof the predecessor manufacturer.\n\n    Over the years, IMO purchased a total of $1.85 billion in\n\ninsurance coverage from all the defendant insurers.       That amount\n\nis sufficient to pay for its anticipated liabilities and defense\n\ncosts for asbestos-related personal injury claims.    Nonetheless,\n\nIMO initiated this litigation to establish its rights under\n\nthose insurance policies and to recover money damages.\n\n    Among many issues and topics, the appeals present some\n\nquestions that have not been previously addressed in the New\n\nJersey Supreme Court's insurance allocation decisions for so-\n\ncalled long-tail environmental losses, beginning with Owens-\n\n\n\n\n                                 7                            A-6240-10T1\n\fIllinois, Inc. v.

We must decide whether the trial court correctly\n\ntreated primary insurance policies that pay for all litigation\n\ndefense costs \"outside the limits,\" or in addition to, the\n\nindemnification limits of the policies.     We must also decide how\n\nthe coverage limits of excess multi-year policies must be\n\ntreated in the allocation model.     Additional issues include\n\nwhether IMO was entitled to a jury trial on its claims for money\n\ndamages, and numerous challenges to the trial court's\n\ninterpretation of insurance policies within the Owens-Illinois\n\nand Carter-Wallace allocation methodology.\n\n    Having considered the record and the parties' written and\n\noral arguments, we find no ground to reverse the many rulings of\n\nthe several judges who presided over this litigation.

It manufactured turbines, pumps, gears, and\n\nother machinery with industrial and military uses, including for\n\nUnited States Navy ships.

Delaval operated as a subsidiary of\n\nTransamerica under different names until its divestiture in 1986\n\nby means of a spin-off to shareholders.     After the divestiture,\n\nplaintiff became IMO Industries, Inc.\n\n     From the 1960s until 1993, Transamerica owned Transamerica\n\nInsurance Company, which became defendant TIG Insurance Company\n\n(\"TIG\") when it was divested in 1993.     Transamerica acquired\n\nPyramid Insurance Company of Bermuda in the 1970s and still\n\nowned it at the time of this litigation.     Transamerica, TIG, and\n\nPyramid are at times collectively referred to in this litigation\n\nas the Transamerica defendants.\n\n     The other defendants are insurance companies, together with\n\ntheir predecessors and affiliates, that provided different\n\nlevels of primary or excess liability insurance to plaintiff or\n\nTransamerica.   Among the excess insurers that have raised issues\n\non appeal are two groups of insurers that we will refer to in\n\nthis opinion as \"ACE\" and \"LMI.\"1     We will also refer to IMO and\n\nTIG to mean the present company or its predecessors.\n\n\n1\n  \"ACE\" in this opinion shall mean one or more of the following\ninsurers: ACE Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Century\n                                                      (continued)\n\n\n                                  9                         A-6240-10T1\n\fRisk Management Program\n\n    In 1972, Transamerica established a corporate risk\n\nmanagement program (\"TARM\") that oversaw insurance matters for\n\nits subsidiaries.    The objectives of the TARM program were to\n\nprotect Transamerica and its subsidiaries from catastrophic\n\nlosses and to minimize costs for insurance coverage and\n\naccidental losses.   According to Transamerica's director of risk\n\nmanagement in the 1980s, the TARM program was never intended to\n\nbe an insurer for subsidiaries, although Transamerica would\n\noften pay losses that fell within a subsidiary's self-insured\n\nretention (\"SIR\").   A SIR operates in some ways like a\n\ndeductible for an insurance policy but also is significantly\n\ndifferent, as we will discuss later in this opinion.   The TARM\n\nprogram procured insurance on behalf of Transamerica's\n\nsubsidiaries in exchange for an annual fee.   The fee covered the\n\ncosts of purchasing insurance, TARM's operating costs, and the\n\nsubsidiary's share of losses.\n\n\n(continued)\nIndemnity Company, CCI Insurance Company, Insurance Company of\nNorth America, Indemnity Insurance Company of North America,\nCentral National Insurance Company of Omaha, Service Fire\nInsurance Company, Industrial Underwriters Insurance Company,\nand Pacific Employers Insurance Company.\n\n  \"LMI\" stands for \"London Market Insurers\" and shall mean one\nor more of individual Lloyd's syndicates or London Market\ncompanies.\n\n\n\n\n                                 10                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    Transamerica would charge back its payments covering a\n\nsubsidiary's SIRs through the risk management fees.\n\nSubsidiaries like IMO that experienced unique or significant\n\nlosses were also charged a catastrophe fee beyond the normal\n\nrisk management fee.   Before its divestiture in 1986, IMO had\n\npaid approximately $33 million in such fees to Transamerica.\n\nIMO's Insurance Policies\n\n    Before 1964, IMO had general liability policies issued by\n\nNew Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (\"NJM\") and Aetna\n\nCasualty and Surety Company (\"Aetna\").   From 1964 to 1972, IMO\n\npurchased primary insurance directly from TIG.   We will refer to\n\nthese pre-1972 policies as TIG's \"direct policies.\"\n\n    From 1972 through 1976, Transamerica purchased insurance on\n\nbehalf of IMO from the Highlands Insurance Company.   The\n\nHighlands policies were written above a $100,000 SIR, meaning\n\nthat IMO's losses must exceed that level of loss from any single\n\noccurrence before it could access coverage under the Highlands\n\npolicies.   There was no insurance in place to cover IMO's SIR.\n\nTIG also issued excess policies to IMO during this time period.\n\n    From 1977 to 1986, Transamerica purchased first-layer\n\nexcess insurance coverage for IMO from ACE and Pyramid.     These\n\npolicies also required SIRs.   To cover the SIRs, Transamerica\n\npurchased insurance policies from TIG, which are referred to in\n\n\n\n\n                                11                          A-6240-10T1\n\fthis litigation as \"fronting policies.\"     These policies allowed\n\nIMO to obtain insurance certificates showing full coverage for\n\nall losses.    The \"fronting\" reference meant there was no risk\n\nassumed by the insurance carrier, here TIG.2\n\n     The TIG fronting policies had stated coverage limits of $1\n\nmillion from 1977 through 1984 and higher limits for 1985 and\n\n1986, totaling in the aggregate $10.75 million for the ten-year\n\nperiod.   For the fronting policies in effect from 1977 through\n\n1981, defense costs were paid \"outside the limits\" of the\n\npolicies.     This means that the policies would pay their stated\n\n$1 million indemnity limits plus defense costs; the defense\n\ncosts were supplemental to the indemnification coverage and did\n\nnot erode the indemnity limits.     We will refer to these policies\n\nas \"outside the limits\" policies.      Defense costs for the\n\npolicies in effect from 1982 through 1986 were within the policy\n\n2\n  \"Fronting\" means \"[t]he use of a licensed, admitted insurer to\nissue an insurance policy on behalf of a self-insured\norganization or captive insurer without the intention of\ntransferring any of the risk. The risk of loss is retained by\nthe self-insured or captive insurer with an indemnity or\nreinsurance agreement. . . . Fronting arrangements allow\ncaptives and self-insurers to comply with financial\nresponsibility laws imposed by many states that require evidence\nof coverage written by an admitted insurer, such as for\nautomobile liability and workers compensation insurance.\"\nFronting, IRMI Risk & Ins., http://www.irmi.com/online/\ninsurance-glossary/terms/f/fronting.aspx (last visited Sept. 4,\n2014); see also Richard V. Rupp, Insurance & Risk Management\nGlossary 150 (1991) (fronting insurer issues policy on behalf of\ncaptive insurer but assumes little or no financial exposure).\n\n\n\n                                  12                           A-6240-10T1\n\flimits, meaning payments for defense costs did erode the\n\nindemnity limits.\n\n    Thus, IMO had \"direct policies\" from TIG from 1964 through\n\n1972, excess policies at various times including 1972 through\n\n1976, and \"fronting policies\" from 1977 to 1986, the first five\n\nyears of which were \"outside the limits\" policies.   Over the\n\nyears since the 1986 divestiture, TIG made payments totaling\n\nmore than $30 million for IMO's asbestos liabilities and defense\n\ncosts from both its direct and fronting policies.    Adding TIG's\n\npayments from excess policies, TIG paid IMO more than $72\n\nmillion for its asbestos liabilities and costs.\n\n    IMO also received payments from Pyramid's excess policies,\n\nincluding from the time that TIG claimed it had no more\n\nresponsibility for IMO's losses.\n\n    Digressing briefly from the facts to restate the lead issue\n\nin this appeal, TIG claims its policies are exhausted because it\n\nhas paid far more than the amount of loss allocated to it under\n\nthe Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace loss allocation model.\n\nIMO contends TIG's obligations have not ended because the\n\nindemnification limits of the \"outside the limits\" policies\n\ncannot be exhausted by allocating responsibility to those\n\npolicies.   It contends only actual payments that reach the $1\n\nmillion dollar indemnification limits will exhaust TIG's\n\n\n\n\n                                13                          A-6240-10T1\n\fobligation to cover defense costs under the five years of\n\n\"outside the limits\" policies.    According to IMO, as of the end\n\nof 2010, TIG owed an additional $48 million in defense costs\n\nunder those policies.\n\nTransamerica's Agreements with TIG\n\n    Between 1976 and 1992, Transamerica entered into four\n\nagreements with TIG to indemnify TIG for its payments under the\n\nfronting policies.   In 1992, Transamerica and TIG also entered\n\ninto an agreement with regard to the pre-1972 direct policies\n\npursuant to which Transamerica would contribute to TIG half the\n\ntotal amounts of defense and indemnity sought by IMO for\n\nasbestos litigation.    The result of these agreements was that\n\nTransamerica actually paid approximately half the amounts paid\n\nby TIG to IMO under its direct and fronting policies.\n\nDivestiture of IMO\n\n    In 1986, Transamerica divested IMO's predecessor by\n\nspinning off its shares to Transamerica shareholders, and the\n\nnew company became IMO.    The terms of the divestiture were\n\ncontained in a Distribution Agreement dated December 18, 1986.\n\nOn the subject of insurance coverage, the agreement stated:\n\n         Section 6.02 Insurance With respect to all\n         insurance plans of [IMO], [IMO] shall be\n         liable for payment of claims (to the extent\n         not covered by Transamerica's Risk\n         Management Program) arising out of\n         incidents, known or unknown, reported or\n\n\n\n                                 14                         A-6240-10T1\n\f            unreported, which were incurred prior or\n            subsequent to the Distribution Date.\n\n            [(Emphasis added).]\n\nA dispute on appeal pertains to the underscored language and the\n\nobligations, if any, it imposes upon Transamerica after the\n\ndivestiture.\n\nAsbestos Lawsuits, IFAs, and Exhaustion of Policies\n\n    At the time of the 1986 divestiture, IMO had been named as\n\na third-party defendant in three asbestos liability lawsuits.\n\nIMO tendered these claims to TIG for indemnification and\n\ndefense.    TIG provided one hundred percent of the funds to pay\n\nthese claims, and Transamerica then reimbursed TIG at least half\n\nthat amount pursuant to their agreements.     Many more asbestos\n\nclaims were filed after the divestiture, and TIG continued to\n\nprovide a defense to IMO under both its direct policies and its\n\nfronting policies.\n\n    In 1989, IMO sent \"first notice\" letters to excess\n\ninsurers.    These letters made no demand for payment and provided\n\nminimal information about the claims against IMO or any\n\nunderlying policies that might be in place.     In fact, according\n\nto the excess insurers, IMO told them it had ample primary\n\ninsurance coverage and their policies were unlikely to be\n\nreached in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n                                  15                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    In 1991, IMO discovered NJM's and Aetna's older primary\n\ninsurance policies and tendered its asbestos claims to NJM and\n\nto Travelers Insurance Company (\"Travelers\") as successor to\n\nAetna.   Aetna's policies covered IMO from 1955 to 1964.    On\n\nSeptember 30, 1992, IMO entered into an Interim Defense and\n\nIndemnification Funding Agreement (\"IFA\") with TIG and\n\nAetna/Travelers under which all defense costs were to be paid by\n\nTIG and Aetna, and indemnity payments were split in three equal\n\nshares among TIG, Aetna, and IMO.\n\n    NJM, on the other hand, did not acknowledge coverage on its\n\nprimary liability policies issued to IMO from 1935 through 1954.\n\nIMO filed suit against NJM and was successful in compelling it\n\nto provide coverage.   On March 24, 1993, IMO entered into an IFA\n\nwith NJM, which applied in conjunction with the earlier IFA with\n\nTIG and Aetna/Travelers.   Neither of the two IFAs was intended\n\nto be a final allocation of IMO's losses, and both reserved the\n\nparties' rights to seek reallocation of the amounts paid.\n\n    Under the two IFAs, defense costs were split equally among\n\nAetna, NJM, and TIG, and indemnity costs were split equally\n\namong the three insurers and IMO.    In 1998, NJM declared its\n\npolicies exhausted, having paid $4,234,703 in defense and\n\nindemnity costs.   It made no further payments after that time.\n\nWhen Aetna balked at continuing payments, IMO filed suit against\n\n\n\n\n                                16                          A-6240-10T1\n\fAetna and IMO's excess insurers seeking to compel payments under\n\nAetna's IFA.   IMO did not actively pursue the matter against the\n\nexcess insurers, and in 2000 it voluntarily dismissed them from\n\nthe litigation.   A new sharing arrangement was reached among\n\nAetna/Travelers, TIG, and IMO under which Aetna paid one fourth\n\nof defense costs and one fourth of indemnity costs, IMO paid one\n\nthird of indemnity costs and none of the defense costs, and the\n\nbalance of both types of costs was paid by TIG.\n\n    Aetna declared its policies exhausted in August 2003,\n\nhaving paid a total of $15,240,064.   IMO did not challenge\n\nAetna's declaration of exhaustion.    TIG then continued making\n\npayments under the IFAs for several more months, paying one\n\nhundred percent of defense costs and two thirds of the indemnity\n\ncosts.   All of IMO's defense costs through the end of 2003 were\n\npaid by means of the IFAs, and IMO incurred no unreimbursed\n\ndefense costs through that time.\n\n    In early 2004, when TIG declared its 1977 through 1986\n\nfronting policy limits exhausted, TIG had paid a total of\n\n$30,856,193 to IMO as reimbursement of indemnity and defense\n\ncosts, these payments being allocated by TIG to both its pre-\n\n1972 direct policies and to the 1977 through 1986 fronting\n\npolicies.\n\n\n\n\n                                17                          A-6240-10T1\n\fOwens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace\n\n    The New Jersey Supreme Court's 1994 decision in Owens-\n\nIllinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 478-79, first established the\n\n\"continuous trigger\" theory of insurance coverage for long-tail\n\nenvironmental losses, such as exposure to asbestos.    The Court\n\ndefined the term \"occurrence\" in liability policies to mean a\n\nseparate triggering event for insurance coverage in each year\n\nfrom the time a claimant alleging injury was first exposed to\n\nasbestos until manifestation of an asbestos-related disease or\n\nuntil insurance coverage became unavailable.   Ibid.   The Court\n\nalso established a pro-rated model for the allocation of\n\ncoverage responsibilities among multiple insurers based on an\n\ninsurer's time on the loss and limits of risk coverage in the\n\npolicies.   Id. at 474-75.\n\n    In July 1998, the Court issued its decision in Carter-\n\nWallace, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1929269\"><a href=\"/opinion/1929269/carter-wallace-v-admiral-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, as further development of the\n\nallocation methodology.   The Court held that excess insurers\n\nwere included in the model, and that policies would be exhausted\n\n\"vertically\" in each year of coverage applicable to a claim\n\nrather than all primary insurance policies being exhausted\n\n\"horizontally\" first across the range of \"triggered\" coverage\n\nyears before excess insurers' policies would attach.    Id. at\n\n325-28.\n\n\n\n\n                                18                         A-6240-10T1\n\f    In November 1998, representatives from IMO, TIG, and\n\nTransamerica met and discussed applying the Carter-Wallace\n\nallocation methodology to IMO's claims.   IMO's General Counsel\n\nstrongly disagreed with Carter-Wallace and refused to apply its\n\nmethodology to allocate responsibility among IMO's insurers.      He\n\nwas satisfied with the IFA arrangements in place where IMO paid\n\na third of indemnity and no defense costs.\n\nThe Present Litigation\n\n    In 2002, IMO sought assurance from the Transamerica\n\ndefendants that they would continue to pay full defense costs\n\nand most of the indemnity costs for asbestos claims.   When\n\nassurance was not given, IMO filed its initial complaint in\n\nAugust 2003 against the Transamerica defendants.\n\n    In early 2004, the Transamerica defendants informed IMO\n\nthat TIG's fronting policies were exhausted as of December 31,\n\n2003.   A February 4, 2004 letter written by counsel for Pyramid\n\nstated that, up to December 31, 2003, Transamerica had paid \"at\n\nleast $9,703,101 in indemnity for asbestos bodily injury claims,\n\nand at least $5,138,148 for expenses for those claims\" and that\n\nthose sums exceeded the amount of the SIRs and the limits of\n\nTIG's fronting policies.   The letter informed IMO that any\n\nfuture payments for indemnity and expenses would be paid \"by\n\nPyramid's excess policies, up to the limits of the Pyramid\n\n\n\n\n                                19                         A-6240-10T1\n\fpolicies.\"   Pyramid's future payments would be based on its\n\nCarter-Wallace allocation share after a short transitional\n\nperiod.\n\n     Although IMO eventually added the excess insurers to the\n\npresent litigation, it initially told them in private meetings\n\nthat it had done so to avoid inconsistent judgments if active\n\nlitigation against the excess insurers were to become necessary\n\nin the future.   IMO reassured the excess insurers that their\n\npolicies were not going to be reached because the TIG \"outside\n\nthe limits\" policies for 1977 through 1981 would never reach\n\ntheir limits of coverage.3\n\n     In July 2005, IMO appeared to waver in its belief that the\n\nTIG policies had not been exhausted.    As a result, Pyramid\n\nagreed that its excess policies were triggered and advanced IMO\n\n$2 million toward defense invoices.    In August 2005, however,\n\n\n\n\n3\n  According to TIG and some of the excess insurers, IMO\noriginally took the position that the $1 million limits of the\nfronting policies would never be reached because each asbestos\npersonal injury claim was a separate occurrence, and IMO's\nindemnification liability for those claims was a relatively\nsmall amount. No individual asbestos claim would exhaust the $1\nmillion in indemnification coverage and TIG would perpetually\nhave to provide defense costs on the \"outside the limits\"\npolicies. As we will explain further, IMO and its expert\npresented a different version of their theory of \"limitless\ndefense costs\" during this litigation that did not rely on a\nseparate occurrence and $1 million dollars of indemnity coverage\nfor each individual claim.\n\n\n\n                                20                         A-6240-10T1\n\fIMO again asserted that the TIG policies had not been exhausted.\n\nPyramid then stopped making payments.\n\n    On August 21, 2007, IMO wrote to excess insurers demanding\n\nthat they pay IMO's asbestos losses in accordance with an\n\nallocation calculated by IMO's expert, Dr. Charles Mullin.      In\n\nhis trial testimony, Mullin reviewed his calculations and agreed\n\nthat they indicated TIG's fronting policies should be allocated\n\n$13,349,296 in defense and indemnity costs.      He subsequently\n\nadjusted that figure to $13,433,600.\n\n    Since making its August 2007 demand on excess insurers, IMO\n\nhas settled with more than a dozen of them, with total policy\n\nlimits of at least $708 million.      Some of the excess insurers\n\nthat did not settle and raise issues in this appeal have also\n\npaid millions of dollars to IMO under their policies.\n\n    On September 10, 2008, IMO produced a new allocation of\n\nlosses and claimed that TIG and Transamerica owed millions more\n\nthan the approximately $13.5 million calculated in Mullin's\n\nearlier allocations.    IMO based this claim on TIG's continuing\n\nobligation to pay defense costs under the first five fronting\n\npolicies until its actual payments of indemnification\n\nobligations, rather than allocation, reached the $1 million\n\nlevel of each policy.    IMO claimed that allocation of losses to\n\nthe fronting policies under the Carter-Wallace model was not\n\n\n\n\n                                 21                          A-6240-10T1\n\fsufficient to reach their limits but actual payment had to be\n\nmade by TIG in accordance with the language of those policies.\n\n    In this litigation, IMO has referred to this coverage\n\nposition by several different names, including \"bookend\" and\n\n\"limitless defense costs.\"   The Transamerica defendants refer to\n\nit as the \"running spigot\" theory of coverage under TIG's\n\nfronting policies of 1977 through 1981.   The crux of this theory\n\nis that, with defense costs being paid outside the policy\n\nlimits, TIG's obligation to cover defense costs for claims that\n\ncould be attributed to those policy years would continue until\n\nTIG actually paid $1 million in indemnity costs from the policy\n\nin each of those years.   With the small amount of indemnity\n\npayments on the liability that IMO has for injured plaintiffs in\n\nasbestos cases (many of those cases settling for only several\n\nthousand dollars from IMO), the limits of the TIG \"outside the\n\nlimits\" policies would not be reached for many years.     TIG's\n\nobligation to continue paying for defense costs would continue\n\nindefinitely.\n\nPleadings and Pre-Trial Proceedings\n\n    IMO began this litigation with its first complaint and jury\n\ndemand filed in August 2003 against only the Transamerica\n\ndefendants.   It sought a declaration of rights and obligations\n\nunder the TARM program and under the primary and excess\n\n\n\n\n                                22                          A-6240-10T1\n\finsurance policies issued by TIG and Pyramid.     It also sought\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract and\n\nrelated causes of action.    Defendants filed answers, cross-\n\nclaims, counterclaims, and a third-party complaint against three\n\nexcess insurance carriers.\n\n    In 2004, IMO filed a second amended complaint, adding new\n\nclaims against the Transamerica defendants and also naming\n\nnumerous excess insurers as defendants.      Over time in this\n\nlitigation, most of the excess insurers either settled with IMO\n\nor were dismissed from the case.      Twelve defendants remained in\n\nthe case at the time of the trials beginning in 2009.\n\n    In the intervening time, the court entered orders holding\n\nthat New Jersey law is applicable to certain pertinent issues,\n\ngranting or denying summary judgment on various grounds,\n\ndetermining that the Carter-Wallace allocation methodology would\n\nbe applied, and appointing a special allocation master (\"SAM\")\n\nto consider all allocation-related issues and to make\n\nrecommendations to the trial judge.\n\n    In January 2009, Retired Judge Robert Muir, Jr., was\n\nrecalled to the bench and assigned to the case.      At about that\n\ntime, Pyramid and TIG renewed motions they had filed earlier to\n\nstrike plaintiff's jury demand and to proceed with a bench\n\ntrial.   On June 30, 2009, Judge Muir granted the motions and\n\n\n\n\n                                 23                          A-6240-10T1\n\fordered that all issues would be tried without a jury.   This\n\ncourt and the Supreme Court denied IMO's motions for leave to\n\nappeal that ruling.\n\nBench Trials on Discrete Issues\n\n    In June 2009, Judge Muir tried the issues related to\n\ncertain excess insurers in a four-day bench trial.   He issued a\n\nfinal decision and order on the excess insurers' coverage\n\ndisputes on December 16, 2009.    Several excess insurers â€”\n\nincluding ACE, LMI, and Zurich American Insurance Company and\n\nits predecessors and affiliates (\"Zurich\") â€” have cross-\n\nappealed, challenging Judge Muir's December 2009 decision as\n\nwell as other aspects of the final judgment entered two years\n\nlater.\n\n    After the June 2009 bench trial, Judge Muir scheduled\n\nseparate bench trials on two major issues.    At the Phase I trial\n\nconducted in the early months of 2010, the issue was whether the\n\nTIG fronting policies were in fact exhausted.   Judge Muir found\n\nby an oral decision on October 14, 2010, that the policies were\n\nnot only exhausted by the end of 2003, but that TIG had overpaid\n\nits obligations.\n\n    In reaching that conclusion, Judge Muir found that IMO's\n\nallocation expert, Mullin, was not a credible witness and that\n\nIMO's \"limitless defense costs\" or \"running spigot\" theory was\n\n\n\n\n                                  24                          A-6240-10T1\n\fnot supported by the evidence or legal precedent.   He determined\n\nthat TIG had paid $9,655,200 in indemnity losses and $6,254,400\n\nin defense costs, for a total of $15,909,600 paid under its\n\nfronting policies of 1977 through 1986 and also excess policies\n\nfrom 1972 through 1976.   Since the judge's findings allocated\n\n$13,636,700 to IMO's defense costs and indemnification losses\n\nduring that time period based on an allocation model prepared by\n\nthe SAM, TIG had overpaid its obligations by $2,271,900.    Judge\n\nMuir stated it would be inequitable and unconscionable to allow\n\nIMO to keep the overpayments, but he did not rule further with\n\nrespect to disposition of TIG's overpayments, and did not reach\n\nany decision as to payments TIG had made under its pre-1972\n\ndirect policies.\n\n    At the Phase II trial held in the spring of 2010, Judge\n\nMuir considered the dispute between IMO and Transamerica.     In\n\nhis written decision issued on December 29, 2010, the judge\n\nfound that IMO had failed to establish the existence of an\n\nimplied-in-fact contract requiring Transamerica to continue\n\nreimbursing IMO for its SIRs and other unreimbursed costs of\n\nasbestos claims, and that the written Distribution Agreement\n\ncontrolling the 1986 divestiture of IMO is an unambiguous\n\ncontract that governs the issues between IMO and Transamerica.\n\nThe judge rejected IMO's assertion that Transamerica was IMO's\n\n\n\n\n                                25                          A-6240-10T1\n\fde facto insurer for its SIRs, deductibles, and other expenses,\n\nand he dismissed IMO's claims for breach of contract, estoppel,\n\nand bad faith.\n\n    Judge Muir completed his service on recall in January 2011\n\nafter issuing his decisions on the Phase I and Phase II trials.\n\nRetired Judge Donald Coburn was then assigned on recall to\n\npreside over the case.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\n    Following the Phase I trial, the SAM prepared a retroactive\n\nallocation of IMO's losses, which \"ignored\" payments by TIG and\n\nothers in calculating the allocation figures and made no\n\nrecommendations as to the treatment of overpayments by TIG that\n\nJudge Muir had found.    Because the SAM's report attributed\n\ndefense costs to TIG after 2003, it concluded that TIG still\n\nowed IMO almost $2 million under the fronting policies.\n\n    Judge Coburn directed the SAM to prepare a new loss\n\nallocation report that did not accept IMO's \"running spigot\"\n\ntheory and took into account all payments made by TIG.    The\n\nSAM's revised allocation schedule issued in April 2011 was based\n\non total estimated costs to IMO of $325 million through the end\n\nof 2010.   It allocated $15,232,832 to the TIG fronting policies\n\nunder what TIG calls a \"modified spigot\" theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                 26                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    In his ruling on the final loss allocation, Judge Coburn\n\nrejected parts of the SAM's revised allocation schedule as\n\ncontrary to Judge Muir's Phase I decision.    Applying Judge\n\nMuir's decision that TIG payments from policy years that were\n\noverpaid would be transferred to those years that were\n\nunderpaid, Judge Coburn determined that all payments from TIG,\n\nincluding those previously attributed to the pre-1972 direct\n\npolicies, could be transferred to determine if policies were\n\nexhausted under the proper Carter-Wallace allocation.      He\n\nfurther found that the \"running spigot\" theory was not supported\n\nby IMO's own reasonable expectations when it procured the\n\ninsurance policies, and that the allocation of additional\n\ndefense costs to the fronting policies would be disproportionate\n\nto the degree of risk transferred to TIG under those policies.\n\n    Judge Coburn adjusted the SAM's calculation by reducing\n\ndefense costs attributed to TIG by the amounts incurred after\n\nthe TIG policies were exhausted.    He allocated $8,165,364 in\n\nindemnity and $5,159,341 in defense costs to TIG's pre-1972\n\ndirect policies, a total of $13,324,705.    He allocated\n\n$8,403,478 in indemnity and $5,342,606 in defense costs to TIG's\n\nfronting policies, a total of $13,746,084.    By taking into\n\naccount TIG's payments under the IFAs, which totaled\n\n$30,856,193, and also payments made by another insurer\n\n\n\n\n                               27                               A-6240-10T1\n\faffiliated with TIG, Judge Coburn determined that TIG had\n\noverpaid IMO $15,201,438, which he rounded off to $15,200,000.\n\n    Judge Coburn suggested that the parties discuss resolution\n\nof how that amount might be reimbursed to TIG by the excess\n\ninsurers that had coverage obligations.   The parties, however,\n\nwere not able to resolve the issue.   By final judgment dated\n\nAugust 16, 2011, the judge awarded $15,200,000 to TIG as money\n\ndamages against IMO for TIG's overpayments on its policies, plus\n\nprejudgment interest of $1,400,000.   Of the amount awarded to\n\nTIG, the judgment accounted for a total of $8,521,771 as sums\n\npaid or to be paid by ACE, LMI, and one other excess insurer to\n\nIMO, the balance being IMO's separate responsibility.\n\n    The final judgment also declared that Transamerica had no\n\nfurther obligation to IMO for its asbestos claims, and the\n\nexcess insurers were ordered to pay their shares according to\n\nthe allocation schedule adopted by the final judgment.    The\n\njudgment also denied IMO's application for attorneys' fees and\n\nprejudgment interest and Transamerica's application for\n\nattorneys' fees under an indemnification provision of the 1986\n\nDistribution Agreement.   All remaining claims, counterclaims,\n\nand cross-claims that were not specifically addressed in the\n\nfinal judgment were dismissed with prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                28                          A-6240-10T1\n\f                                 II.\n\n              Exhaustion of TIG's Fronting Policies\n\n    The lead issue in the case â€” the exhaustion issue â€” is\n\nwhether TIG must cover defense costs for an endless or\n\nindefinite time until it has actually paid the indemnification\n\nlimits of its policies, or whether those policies were exhausted\n\nand TIG has no further obligations to IMO.\n\n    IMO, some excess insurers, and amicus curiae Independent\n\nEnergy Producers of New Jersey claim error in Judge Muir's\n\nexhaustion decision and its implementation by Judge Coburn in\n\nthe final allocation judgment.    They contend the judges failed\n\nto hold TIG liable for a continuing obligation to pay defense\n\ncosts although the fronting policies from 1977 through 1981\n\nrequire payment of defense costs \"outside the limits\" of the\n\nindemnification coverage.\n\n    The policies provide that the insurer will \"not be\n\nobligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit\n\nafter the applicable limit of the company's liability has been\n\nexhausted by payment of judgments or settlements\" (emphasis\n\nadded).   IMO argues that the policies unambiguously require\n\nexhaustion by formal payment, not just by allocation of\n\nsufficient losses to the policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                 29                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    Before we address this argument, we will review Owens-\n\nIllinois, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164986\"><a href=\"/opinion/2164986/owens-illinois-inc-v-united-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and some cases that followed it.\n\nOwens-Illinois is the seminal case in New Jersey setting forth\n\nthe methodology for proportional allocation of indemnity and\n\ndefense costs among multiple insurers in \"long-tail\"\n\nenvironmental exposure litigation.

Owens-Illinois, supra,\n\n138 N.J. at 447.   The Court explained that, where injuries were\n\nsustained over long periods of time, questions arise as to when\n\nand how liability insurance coverage of the allegedly\n\nresponsible parties is triggered and as to how losses should be\n\nfairly allocated among the range of triggered policies.\n\nSpaulding Composites, supra, 176 N.J. at 32.   The Court observed\n\nthat rigid enforcement of the policy terms as governed by\n\ntraditional principles of insurance law could not capture the\n\ntime of an occurrence in the context of such toxic-tort\n\nlitigation.   Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 457-59.    It\n\nconcluded that \"[m]ass-exposure toxic-tort cases have simply\n\n\n\n\n                                30                          A-6240-10T1\n\fexceeded the capacity of conventional models of judicial\n\nresponse.\"    Id. at 459.\n\n    The Court reviewed a number of options to resolve the\n\nquestion of determining the \"occurrence\" of an injury that does\n\nnot manifest for many years.      It ultimately adopted a\n\n\"continuous-trigger\" theory by which an injury would trigger\n\ncoverage continuously from the date of the claimant's first\n\nexposure to asbestos onward as a single \"occurrence\" for each\n\nyear.    Id. at 478-79.     The Court then adopted a pro-rata\n\nallocation methodology, distributing the insured's losses for\n\nthe triggered time period in percentage shares commensurate with\n\nthe \"degree of risk transferred or retained in each of the years\n\nof repeated exposure to injurious conditions.\"       Id. at 475.     The\n\nresulting allocation among insurance policies would thus be\n\n\"related to both the time on the risk and the degree of risk\n\nassumed.\"    Id. at 479.    The insured would share in the\n\nallocation for periods where it voluntarily retained the risk\n\nrather than contracting for available insurance.       Ibid.    Policy\n\nlimits and exclusions would remain applicable, and the resulting\n\nallocation would conform to the particulars of the policies at\n\nissue.   Id. at 476.\n\n    The Court \"recognize[d] the difficulties of apportioning\n\ncosts with any scientific certainty,\" but accepted that a \"rough\n\n\n\n\n                                    31                          A-6240-10T1\n\fmeasure\" of each insurer's proportionate allocation of losses\n\nmight be the best that could be achieved.    Id. at 476-77.     The\n\nCourt never independently addressed allocation of defense costs\n\nas opposed to indemnification for claims that the insured would\n\nhave to pay to the injured person, though the undeniable\n\nimplication of Owens-Illinois is that defense costs are also\n\nallocable, subject to policy terms, in the same manner as\n\nindemnity expenditures.\n\n    In Carter-Wallace, supra, 154 N.J. at 325-27, the Court\n\nconfirmed the application of the continuous-trigger theory and\n\npro-rata methodology in allocating liability among both primary\n\nand excess policies.   It rejected an argument made by the\n\nsecond-level excess insurer in that case that the insured party\n\nmust exhaust all primary and first-level excess policies in the\n\nentire coverage block before accessing any second-level excess\n\ncoverage.   Id. at 324.\n\n    The Court also rejected the insured's contention that the\n\nentire universe of losses should be collapsed to a single year\n\nso as to access immediately the coverage from all insurers for\n\nthat one year.   Id. at 325.   Neither of these arguments was\n\nfaithful to the holding of Owens-Illinois that ongoing injuries\n\nshould be treated as a single occurrence within each year.\n\nConsequently, the Court adopted an approach requiring that\n\n\n\n\n                                 32                           A-6240-10T1\n\flosses first be allocated \"horizontally\" among the range of\n\nyears in the coverage block, but that policies be exhausted\n\n\"vertically\" within each year, such that each successive layer\n\nof insurance within a given year would be accessed as the one\n\nbelow was exhausted.   Id. at 327-28.   The Court added:\n\n         Our jurisprudence in this area has not been\n         marked by rigid mathematical formulas, and\n         we do not advocate any such inflexibility\n         now. Rather, our focus remains on \"[a] fair\n         method of allocation . . . that is related\n         to both the time on the risk and the degree\n         of risk assumed.\" [Owens-Illinois, supra,\n         138 N.J.] at 479. Nevertheless, we\n         anticipate that the principles of Owens-\n         Illinois, as clarified by our decision\n         today, represent the presumptive rule for\n         resolving the allocation issue among primary\n         and excess insurers in continuous trigger\n         liability cases unless exceptional\n         circumstances dictate application of a\n         different standard.\n\n         [Carter-Wallace, supra, 154 N.J. at 327-28.]\n\n    In Spaulding Composites, supra, 176 N.J. at 28, the Court\n\nconsidered whether application of a \"non-cumulation\" clause in a\n\ncomprehensive general liability policy could be enforced\n\nconsistently with the Owens-Illinois methodology.    Such clauses\n\n\"operate[] to limit an insurer's liability under multiple\n\nsequential . . . policies where losses related to a 'single\n\noccurrence' trigger the successive policies.\"    Id. at 43-44\n\n(emphasis added).   The purpose of such clauses is to avoid the\n\n\"'cumulation' of policy limits for damage arising out of [a]\n\n\n\n                                33                          A-6240-10T1\n\fsingle occurrence . . . .\"    Id. at 44.   Because Owens-Illinois\n\nhad explicitly rejected the theory that an injury in a long-term\n\nenvironmental exposure case constitutes one single occurrence,\n\nthe Court held that non-cumulation clauses simply did not apply\n\nin that context.   Ibid.   It added:\n\n         [E]ven if the non-cumulation clause was not\n         facially inapplicable, we would not enforce\n         it because it would thwart the Owens-\n         Illinois pro-rata allocation modality. Once\n         the court turns to pro rata allocation, it\n         makes sense that the non-cumulation clause,\n         which would allow the insurer to avoid its\n         fair share of responsibility, drops out of\n         the policy.\n\n         [Ibid.]\n\nThus Spaulding Composites supports the proposition that the\n\nOwens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation model supersedes\n\ncontrary terms of an insurance policy.\n\n    The Court again affirmed the allocation model in Benjamin\n\nMoore & Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436110/benjamin-moore-co-v-aetna-cas/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91\n\n(2004), but this time the Court adhered to the language of the\n\npolicies where they did not conflict with the allocation model.\n\nIn Benjamin Moore, the Court determined that an insured would\n\nhave to satisfy its full per-occurrence deductibles for each\n\npolicy before accessing indemnity coverage.     In so doing, the\n\nCourt clarified that:\n\n         when a policy is triggered, so are its\n         fundamental terms and conditions. Although\n\n\n\n                                 34                         A-6240-10T1\n\f         Owens-Illinois did not turn on policy\n         language or traditional interpretation rules\n         because it was crafting an overarching\n         scheme for solving the scientifically\n         unsolvable problem of determining how to\n         allocate progressive environmental damage to\n         sequential policies, that scheme was\n         nevertheless meant to be superimposed on the\n         specific terms of insurance contracts. That\n         is why the Owens-Illinois allocation\n         methodology is subject to \"limits and\n         exclusions.\" In other words, Owens-Illinois\n         was never intended to displace the basic\n         provisions of the insurance contract so long\n         as those provisions are not inconsistent\n         with the underlying methodology specifically\n         adopted in that case.\n\n         [Id. at 101 (emphasis added and citations\n         omitted).]\n\n    IMO argues this last-quoted explanation by the Court means\n\nthat the Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation\n\nmethodology must be superimposed over the terms of TIG's\n\nfronting policies rather than superseding those terms.     If, as\n\nIMO contends, the policies require that only actual payments for\n\nIMO's losses can relieve TIG of its contractual obligation to\n\npay for defense costs, total coverage of IMO's losses and the\n\nattachment point for excess insurers will be affected.\n\n    IMO and amicus curiae contend that Judge Coburn mistakenly\n\ndeemed the policy language requiring actual payment to be\n\nambiguous and inappropriately resolved that ambiguity in favor\n\nof his own belief that a reasonable insured would never expect\n\ncoverage of defense costs far exceeding the indemnity limits of\n\n\n\n                               35                           A-6240-10T1\n\fa policy.   Judge Coburn commented that an insurer would pay its\n\nindemnification limit in full before incurring a much larger\n\nobligation to pay defense costs, but IMO and amicus curiae\n\ncontend that case law prohibits an insurer that provided\n\n\"outside the limits\" defense coverage from avoiding its\n\nobligations by paying its indemnity limit and then abandoning\n\nthe insured.

Consequently, the SAM's\n\nallocation schedule had \"only used the indemnity amount of each\n\n\n\n\n                                36                          A-6240-10T1\n\fpolicy without attempting to include any value for those\n\nportions of policies that paid defense costs in addition to the\n\nface amount.\"   The parties agreed with this approach for the\n\nsake of efficiency since the difference in the allocation\n\npercentages would be negligible.\n\n    Judge Coburn disagreed with IMO that the policy language of\n\nTIG's \"outside the limits\" fronting policies unambiguously\n\nrequires exhaustion by formal payment.   He stated he would\n\nconstrue that language consistently with Owens-Illinois and the\n\nreasonable expectations of the parties to permit exhaustion by\n\nallocation of indemnity losses rather than by actual payment of\n\nthose losses.   Judge Coburn also adopted Judge Muir's conclusion\n\nthat all of TIG's payments pursuant to the IFAs, whether or not\n\nreimbursed by Transamerica, would count to satisfy the limits of\n\nthe fronting policies.   He agreed with Judge Muir that annual\n\npolicy limits would be exhausted by crediting across coverage\n\nyears payments that TIG had previously attributed to one policy\n\nyear to a different underpaid policy year.   As a result of his\n\ncalculations, Judge Coburn not only accepted Judge Muir's\n\nearlier conclusion that the fronting policies had been exhausted\n\nby the end of 2003, but he found that some of the \"outside the\n\nlimits\" policies had been exhausted in 1999 and others in 2000.\n\nIMO complains that not even TIG and Transamerica claimed that\n\n\n\n\n                                37                          A-6240-10T1\n\fthe fronting policies were exhausted earlier than the end of\n\n2003.\n\n    IMO and amicus curiae also criticize Judge Coburn's\n\nstatements that the expectations of the parties would not make\n\nsense if the obligation of TIG to pay defense costs far exceeded\n\nits obligation to provide indemnity coverage under any policy.\n\nThey argue that many liability policies provide for coverage of\n\nlitigation or defense expenses far beyond the indemnification\n\nlimits of the policies, and courts have uniformly recognized the\n\nenforceability of such policy provisions.

But Judge\n\nCoburn was not addressing a typical insurance claim for a single\n\noccurrence and a single insurance policy.   He was deciding how\n\nthe allocation model established in Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\nWallace should apply to long-tail claims, with many primary and\n\nexcess policies covering years of loss, some of which did not\n\n\n\n\n                               38                           A-6240-10T1\n\fhave defined limits of coverage for defense costs.   As Judge\n\nCoburn stated in his decision, \"exhaustion may mean one thing in\n\none context [and] it may mean another thing in another context.\"\n\n    To allay some of the fears expressed by amicus curiae, the\n\nexhaustion decision in this case is closely tied to its facts.\n\nWe reach no general conclusion that an insurer's obligations to\n\ncover defense costs and other litigation expenses through an\n\n\"outside the limits\" policy is limited by the maximum amount of\n\nindemnification coverage provided in that policy.\n\n    In the context of crafting a fair though imprecise\n\nallocation model for long-tail claims, our Supreme Court has\n\nallowed that a policy term that is contrary to the model may\n\n\"drop[] out of the policy.\"   Spaulding Composites, supra, 176\n\nN.J. at 44.   It also suggested that policy terms that are\n\n\"inconsistent with the underlying methodology specifically\n\nadopted in [Owens-Illinois]\" may be displaced.   Benjamin Moore,\n\nsupra, 179 N.J. at 101.   We find no legal error in the trial\n\njudges' interpretation of the \"payment\" provision of the\n\n\"outside the limits\" policies and their reliance on the\n\nsupervening effect of the Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace\n\nallocation methodology.\n\n    Challenging the final allocation judgment on a separate\n\nground, IMO argues that the payments from TIG that were not\n\n\n\n\n                                39                           A-6240-10T1\n\freimbursed by Transamerica were paid out of the direct policies\n\npre-dating 1972 and should not be attributed to the fronting\n\npolicies from 1977 to 1986.    According to IMO, Judge Coburn\n\ndeviated from Judge Muir's decision in transferring payments\n\nacross policy years, resulting in Judge Coburn's finding that\n\nTIG had overpaid its obligations by $15.2 million rather than\n\nthe approximately $2.27 million that Judge Muir found.\n\n    Judge Muir's legal conclusion, however, was not as IMO\n\nclaims.   In responding to IMO's contention that TIG payments\n\nreimbursed by Transamerica should not be credited to TIG's\n\nallocations, Judge Muir concluded that Transamerica's payments\n\nwere equally applicable for TIG's exhaustion purposes as were\n\nTIG's unreimbursed payments.    He stated:\n\n          [W]ho made the payments to IMO [was]\n          irrelevant, just as it would be if TIG went\n          out and borrowed money to make the payments.\n          That the payments were made and were\n          received by IMO as part of the Fronting\n          Policy indemnity duty is the only issue of\n          concern. I reject any adverse inferences\n          IMO projects from the fact Transamerica made\n          payments.\n\n    But Judge Muir did not limit the transfer of overpayments\n\non TIG policies to the years that the fronting policies were in\n\neffect.   The final allocation schedule adopted by the court\n\nshowed some of TIG's policies individually overpaid and others\n\nindividually underpaid.   Judge Coburn carried forward to\n\n\n\n\n                                 40                         A-6240-10T1\n\fadditional calculations Judge Muir's conclusion that overpaid\n\nyears could be shifted to underpaid years and that IMO should\n\nnot be permitted to retain the total overpayment once the\n\nallocation schedule was complete and the entirety of TIG's\n\nobligations was determined.\n\n    TIG's payments totaled more than $30 million.     Although\n\nsome of those payments are attributable to the pre-1972 direct\n\npolicies, more than $15 million, according to Judge Muir's\n\nfindings and more than $13 million according to Judge Coburn's\n\nfindings based on a revised allocation schedule, were\n\nattributable to TIG's fronting policies.   There is no dispute\n\nthat TIG made payments that exceeded the aggregate of its Owens-\n\nIllinois and Carter-Wallace allocations.   So, we can say its\n\npolicies were exhausted not just by allocation, but by\n\nallocation combined with payments that exceeded the total amount\n\nallocated to TIG.\n\n    We also reject IMO's argument that such retrospective\n\nshifting of payments across coverage years violates the holding\n\nof Carter-Wallace that prohibits horizontal distribution of\n\nlosses over several policy years.   That holding pertains to a\n\ndifferent question, whether all primary insurance policies over\n\nthe range of coverage years have to be exhausted before the\n\ncoverage obligations of any excess policies attach.    Carter-\n\n\n\n\n                               41                           A-6240-10T1\n\fWallace, supra, 154 N.J. at 324-25.   That holding is not\n\napplicable to the exhaustion decision in this case.\n\n    A contrary conclusion on shifting of payments among\n\ncoverage years might provide an incentive for an insurer not to\n\npay claims promptly on the chance that a future development in\n\nthe law, or the discovery of additional policies and additional\n\nresponsible insurers, results in a lesser obligation.   When TIG,\n\nacting alone or in conjunction with Aetna and NJM, paid for\n\nIMO's defense expenses in full under the IFAs through 2003, it\n\ndid so without a concession that its payments were the correct\n\namount of its allocated responsibility and without waiving a\n\nright to claim credits when a final allocation was determined.\n\n    As a result of Judge Muir's and Judge Coburn's decisions,\n\ndefense costs are allocated to TIG's fronting policies in\n\ngeneral conformity with the risks transferred to those policies.\n\nOnce the indemnity limits of the fronting policies were reached\n\nby allocation, and the prior aggregate payments from TIG\n\nexceeded those allocations, TIG's coverage was exhausted.     The\n\nalternative, that TIG's responsibility for defense costs would\n\nremain open indefinitely, would contradict the mandate of Owens-\n\nIllinois requiring allocation proportionate to the risks\n\ntransferred to the insurer.   The trial court correctly construed\n\n\n\n\n                                42                          A-6240-10T1\n\fthe \"payment\" language in the \"outside the limits\" policies in\n\nthe context of an Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation.\n\n    IMO further contends that the trial judges ignored the\n\ninsurers' contemporaneous conduct in performing their\n\nobligations under the policies.     It contends that TIG and\n\nTransamerica made payments for seventeen years after the 1986\n\ndivestiture because they understood their obligations to do so\n\nunder their contracts with IMO.     We reject this argument, too.\n\n    It hinges on a spreadsheet prepared by a representative of\n\nTransamerica, which shows that the policies were overpaid in the\n\naggregate but not all the individual fronting policies had\n\nsufficient losses allocated to exhaust them outright.     Judge\n\nMuir rejected the probative value of the spreadsheet as both\n\ninaccurate in its figures and ultimately immaterial to an Owens-\n\nIllinois and Carter-Wallace allocation.    We defer to the judge's\n\nrejection of that evidence as evaluated in the context of the\n\nfull record.   See Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2059288\"><a href=\"/opinion/2059288/rova-farms-resort-v-investors-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483-84 (1974).\n\n    TIG made payments in good faith pursuant to the IFAs.         At\n\nthe time of TIG's payments, allocation pursuant to Owens-\n\nIllinois and Carter-Wallace had not been mandated or was not\n\nattempted yet in this matter.     The overpayments resulted from\n\nongoing development of the law fixing the responsibilities of\n\n\n\n\n                                  43                           A-6240-10T1\n\fthe many insurers on the risk.    The fact that the timing of\n\nTIG's payments failed to coincide with loss allocations as\n\ncalculated later was simply an accident of the development of\n\nthe pertinent law.\n\n    It was also a product of IMO's refusal to allow a Carter-\n\nWallace allocation at an earlier time to replace the IFAs.       If\n\nthe court were to decrease IMO's and the excess insurers'\n\nliability for defense costs at TIG's expense, it would distort\n\nthe parties' relative share of liability in a manner that does\n\nnot accurately reflect the degree of risk each assumed.\n\n    In addition, IMO's \"running spigot\" theory contradicts the\n\ndictates of Owens-Illinois and would afford IMO an impermissible\n\ndouble recovery of some defense costs already borne by its\n\nprimary insurers pursuant to the IFAs.    In this case, producing\n\na proper allocation pursuant to Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\nWallace requires that the fronting policies be construed to have\n\nbeen exhausted by allocation and aggregate payment by TIG that\n\nexceeded the policy limits.\n\n    Finally, Transamerica and TIG offer as an alternative\n\nground for affirmance of the exhaustion issue that IMO should be\n\nbarred from raising its \"running spigot\" theory by the doctrine\n\nof unclean hands.    That doctrine permits the court to refuse\n\nequitable relief to a \"wrongdoer with respect to the subject\n\n\n\n\n                                 44                         A-6240-10T1\n\fmatter of the suit,\" specifically where the party is \"guilty of\n\nbad faith . . . in the underlying transaction.\"      Pellitteri v.\n\nPellitteri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1438742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1438742/pellitteri-v-pellitteri/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

Super. at 65.\n\n    Because IMO had previously insisted that TIG adhere to its\n\nobligations under the IFAs rather than determine its obligations\n\npursuant to the Carter-Wallace methodology, Judge Muir invoked\n\nthe doctrine of unclean hands to bar IMO from contesting the\n\nshifting of overpayments to TIG's underpaid policies when IMO\n\npursued a Carter-Wallace allocation in this litigation.      The\n\njudge stated IMO could not reverse course after it filed suit\n\nand take the position that the IFA payments were voluntarily\n\nmade by TIG and Transamerica and could not be used as credits\n\nfor underpaid years.     We agree with the Transamerica defendants\n\nthat the unclean hands doctrine also supports affirmance of\n\nJudge Muir's exhaustion decision.\n\n    In sum, Judge Muir correctly determined that payments by or\n\non behalf of a single insurer could be shifted from one policy\n\n\n\n\n                                  45                         A-6240-10T1\n\fyear to another to determine exhaustion, and that the TIG\n\nfronting policies were exhausted by the end of 2003.   In\n\naddition, Judge Coburn's final judgment, which deemed the\n\nfronting policies exhausted by allocation rather than by payment\n\non specific policies, was consistent with the dictates of Owens-\n\nIllinois.\n\n                               III.\n\n                                  A.\n\n             Coverage Limits of Multi-Year Policies\n\n    On cross-appeals, ACE, LMI, and TIG allege error in the\n\ntreatment of multi-year policies in the allocation schedule.\n\nThey contend that the plain language of their multi-year\n\npolicies mandates that a single coverage limit for the entire\n\nterm of the policy should have been used in the allocation\n\nschedule rather than the full coverage limit for each year the\n\npolicy was in effect.   They contend there was no basis for\n\nrelying on extrinsic evidence to interpret the policies, and the\n\ntrial court's acceptance of annualized application of the\n\ncoverage limits results in multiplying the coverage that IMO\n\npurchased by the number of years the policies were in effect.\n\nACE and LMI Multi-Year Policies\n\n    ACE and LMI challenge Judge Muir's adoption of the SAM's\n\nruling imposing annual occurrence limits on their multi-year\n\n\n\n\n                                  46                        A-6240-10T1\n\fexcess policies.

LMI similarly contends that its multi-year policies\n\nissued during 1967 to 1976 contain single per-occurrence limits.\n\nThe language addressing the limits of liability differs among\n\nthe policies, but each establishes a liability limit for each\n\noccurrence (or accident) and sets forth an aggregate limit for\n\neach annual period.\n\n    IMO does not dispute that the plain language of the\n\npolicies would impose per-occurrence limits on a term rather\n\nthan annual basis, but it sought a blanket ruling that every\n\nyear of a multi-year policy should be treated as if a separate\n\nannual limit is available for asbestos claims.\n\n    The SAM noted that Owens-Illinois did not resolve this\n\nissue and that the Supreme Court granted discretion to the\n\nmaster appointed by the trial court to develop a formula that\n\nfairly reflects the risks transferred to insurers or assumed by\n\nthe insured.

If\n\nall three years were to be viewed as a single occurrence, the\n\ninsured would be deprived of the annual aggregate limits of the\n\npolicies.

Specifically, TIG contends that the $2.5-million\n\naggregate limit for bodily injury liability should have been\n\napplied for the full three-year period, not separately for each\n\npolicy year.\n\n    IMO initially presented the issue to the special discovery\n\nmaster (\"SDM\") appointed for this litigation, a different\n\nindividual from the SAM.   The SDM ruled that the policy language\n\nwas ambiguous in regard to an annual aggregate limit or a single\n\nlimit for the entire three-year period of the policy.     He\n\nfurther ruled that the only available extrinsic evidence bearing\n\non the policy's interpretation was so one-sided in favor of\n\nIMO's position as to justify the conclusion that the $2.5\n\nmillion aggregate limit applied separately in each policy year.\n\nThe trial court subsequently adopted the SDM's ruling.\n\n    The relevant facts are that TIG issued a policy that ran\n\nfrom July 1, 1967, to July 1, 1970.   The policy provided bodily\n\ninjury coverage under its Coverage A designation and property\n\ndamage coverage under its Coverage B designation.   The\n\ndeclarations page described Coverage A as having an aggregate\n\nproducts liability limit of $2.5 million and Coverage B as\n\n\n\n\n                                52                             A-6240-10T1\n\fhaving limits of $500,000 each for aggregate products,\n\noperations, protective, and contractual liabilities.\n\n    Section 6 of the policy, which addressed products liability\n\nCoverages A and B, provided that, \"[s]ubject to the limit of\n\nliability with respect to 'each occurrence' the limits of bodily\n\ninjury liability and property damage liability stated in the\n\nDeclarations as 'aggregate products' are respectively the total\n\nlimits of the Company's liability for all damages arising out of\n\nthe products hazard.\"   Section 7, which addressed operations,\n\nprotective, and contractual liability under Coverage B, used\n\nsimilar language to delineate the boundaries of those coverages,\n\nbut explicitly added in a final, isolated sentence that\n\n\"[a]ggregate limits of liability as stated in the Declarations\n\nshall apply separately to each annual period\" (emphasis added).\n\nIMO argues that this last-quoted provision creates an ambiguity\n\nand that TIG's own representatives treated the $2.5 million\n\nlimit as applying annually rather than as a total limit for all\n\nthree years of the policy.\n\n    In response, TIG cites Chubb Custom Insurance Co. v.\n\nPrudential Insurance Company of America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357576\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357576/chubb-custom-ins-co-v-prudential-ins-co-of-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238\n\n(2008), among other case law, and argues there is no ambiguity\n\nin the policy and thus the court may not resort to extrinsic\n\nevidence to interpret it.

But, again,\n\nthese cases were not applying the Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\nWallace allocation methodology.\n\n    We do not find legal error in the SDM's and the trial\n\ncourt's conclusion that the policy at issue here was\n\nsufficiently ambiguous that resort to extrinsic evidence should\n\nbe employed to interpret it.   The representatives of TIG who had\n\n\n\n\n                                  54                         A-6240-10T1\n\fresponsibility for implementing the policy invariably applied an\n\nannual $2.5 million aggregate limit in their handling of\n\npertinent claims and in other communications.\n\n    TIG argues that the actions of those employees were not\n\nrelevant to interpreting the policy because they were not\n\ninvolved in drafting or issuing the policy in 1967.     They were\n\nadministering the terms of the policy some thirty years later\n\nwithout ever having reviewed the clear limitations language of\n\nthe policy.   The limitations language of the policy, however, is\n\nnot as clear as TIG claims, and TIG had no witness to contradict\n\nthe interpretation that its own representatives placed on the\n\nmulti-year policy.\n\n    We do not find reversible error in the trial court's\n\nruling.   The court's application of an annual aggregate limit\n\nfor bodily injury to each year of TIG's multi-year policy was\n\nconsistent with the Owens-Illinois and Carter-Wallace allocation\n\nmethodology, and we will not disturb that ruling on appeal.\n\n                                B.\n\n              \"Stub Policies\" (Partial-Year Coverage)\n\n    The ACE defendants claim that the coverage limit of a \"stub\n\npolicy,\" that is, a policy issued or extended for only part of a\n\nyear, should be pro-rated.   They assert that assigning the full\n\npolicy limit for purposes of the Owens-Illinois and Carter-\n\n\n\n\n                                55                          A-6240-10T1\n\fWallace methodology unfairly allows the insured to increase the\n\nliability limits for which it paid a premium.    We disagree.\n\n    An ACE policy in effect from February 13, 1976, to January\n\n1, 1977, provides umbrella liability coverage to a limit of $1\n\nmillion for each occurrence, and $1 million annual aggregate.\n\nACE contends its coverage limit should be pro-rated to reflect\n\nthe time on the risk, which would be eleven-twelfths (or 0.9167)\n\nof $1 million.\n\n    The SAM found that policies issued or extended for a term\n\nof less than one year should be treated for purposes of the\n\nallocation as having a separate annual aggregate limit that will\n\nbe in place for the term of the shortened policy period.    Judge\n\nMuir adopted the SAM's report and recommendation.\n\n    In United States Mineral Products, supra, 348 N.J. Super.\n\nat 536-37, we reasoned that an insured who paid a pro-rated\n\npremium for an additional two weeks of coverage on an excess\n\npolicy identical to that provided by the initial policy would\n\nexpect that such a premium reflected only the insurer's reduced\n\ntime on the risk, not a reduction of the policy's aggregate\n\nlimits.   We concluded that the stub policy created an additional\n\nset of aggregate limits that were available to the insured for\n\nthe term of the policy.   Id. at 550.   Treating a stub policy as\n\nproviding a pro-rated limit would result in the loss allocated\n\n\n\n\n                                56                         A-6240-10T1\n\fto the policy being reduced twice, once by its time on the risk\n\nand a second time by the pro-rating of the policy limit.\n\n       Our holding in United States Mineral Products is clear.     If\n\nthe annual aggregate limits of a stub policy are to be pro-\n\nrated, specific language in the policy must so provide.      Id. at\n\n559.   Nothing in the ACE policy indicates that the annual\n\naggregate limits are pro-rated.\n\n       Judge Muir did not err in attributing the full policy limit\n\nto the ACE policy for the period of time it insured the risk.\n\n                                  C.\n\n               SIRs as Outside the Limits of Policies\n\n       ACE contends that the trial court erred in determining that\n\nIMO's payment of its SIR obligations was outside the coverage\n\nlimits of ACE policies.\n\n       ACE issued two excess umbrella policies to Transamerica and\n\nits subsidiaries, which were in effect from January 1, 1976,\n\nthrough April 1, 1979.    They provided a $1,000,000 limit of\n\ncoverage, and also stated:\n\n           $500,000 Combined Annual Aggregate That\n           Would Otherwise Be Recoverable Hereunder\n           Shall Be Retained by the Insured in Addition\n           to the Underlying Set Forth Above.\n\n       ACE sought a ruling that the limits of the policies were\n\neroded by IMO's retention of $500,000.    The SAM issued a written\n\nreport and recommendation concluding that the $1 million annual\n\n\n\n                                  57                         A-6240-10T1\n\flimits are not eroded by the retention.   He noted that \"[i]t is\n\nlong standing custom and practice in the insurance industry to\n\ndistinguish between deductibles and self insured retentions.\"\n\nWhile the limits of a policy are reduced by a deductible, they\n\nremain intact in the case of a self-insured retention.     The SAM\n\nrejected ACE's argument that the phrase \"that would otherwise be\n\nrecoverable\" as quoted from the policy demonstrated an intention\n\nthat the $500,000 \"retention\" would be deducted from the\n\ncoverage limits.\n\n    The SAM also observed that ACE's position was weakened by\n\nits past course of conduct.   It had paid its full $1 million\n\nlimit for claims occurring during the 1977-78 policy period.\n\nMoreover, an ACE claims adjuster stated in a 1980 status report\n\nthat the policy limits were \"in excess of a self insured\n\nretention of the insured of $500,000 each occurrence plus an\n\nannual aggregate of an additional $500,000 which can be utilized\n\nonly once per year.\"   The SAM found that the adjustor's\n\n\"interpretation of the clause is entirely logical and consistent\n\nwith the reading of the endorsements whereby the word 'retained'\n\nis given the standard meaning denoting a self insured retention,\n\nas commonly understood in the insurance industry.\"\n\n    Judge Muir adopted the SAM's ruling and denied ACE's motion\n\nfor summary judgment with respect to this issue.   The final\n\n\n\n\n                                58                          A-6240-10T1\n\fjudgment allocated a total of $1 million each to the two ACE\n\npolicies.\n\n    Although the SAM found that the distinction between a\n\ndeductible and a SIR is \"black letter insurance law,\" the issue\n\nappears not to have been directly addressed by a New Jersey\n\ncourt.

Rather, the Court stated:\n\n\"In future cases, insurers aware of their responsibility under\n\nthe continuing-trigger theory might minimize their costs by\n\nassuming responsibility for or involving themselves in the\n\ndefense of the actions . . . .\"    Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J.\n\nat 478 (emphasis added).\n\n    It stands to reason that accommodating a challenge to\n\ncoverage in tens of thousands of individual claims would not\n\nonly prove daunting but would compromise the integrity of the\n\nframework Owens-Illinois offers for efficient and equitable\n\nallocation of losses among policies.      As we have stated, policy\n\nterms and traditional principles applicable to ordinary coverage\n\nlitigation must bend insofar as they conflict with application\n\nof the Owens-Illinois framework.       Benjamin Moore, supra, 179\n\nN.J. at 104.   The Court could thus impose a greater obligation\n\non the part of excess insurers than specifically stated in their\n\npolicies to participate in the insured's defense, or risk losing\n\nthe right to challenge coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n                                  65                          A-6240-10T1\n\f    Nor is our conclusion inequitable.   IMO put the excess\n\ninsurers on notice of the thousands of claims against it, and\n\nOwens-Illinois put them on notice of the necessity of\n\nparticipating in order to preserve their right to challenge\n\ncoverage determinations.\n\n    The trial court appropriately gave effect to a plainly\n\nstated directive of Owens-Illinois â€” that insurers who have\n\ndeclined to associate in the defense of claims against the\n\ninsured may be precluded from later challenging coverage.\n\n                                  B.\n\n                 Duty to Defend Uncovered Claims\n\n    ACE argues that the court erred in determining that defense\n\ncosts incurred by IMO in connection with uncovered asbestos\n\nclaims are recoverable under policies that limit defense\n\nreimbursement to costs paid as a consequence of a covered\n\noccurrence.   ACE contends the majority of its policies are\n\nultimate net loss policies that only obligate it to indemnify\n\nIMO where IMO itself becomes obligated by adjudication or\n\ncompromise to pay for a covered occurrence.   Relying on case law\n\nfrom other jurisdictions, ACE maintains that courts interpreting\n\nsimilar policy language have held that the duty to indemnify\n\ndefense costs arises only when the costs are incurred in\n\nconnection with covered claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                  66                        A-6240-10T1\n\f    LMI advances the same argument, although its policies\n\ndiffer from the ACE policies.   However, both excess insurers'\n\npolicies use the same definition of ultimate net loss.   LMI\n\nargues that the ultimate net loss provision makes the existence\n\nof an actually covered claim, and not just a potentially covered\n\nclaim, a prerequisite for indemnification of defense costs.     It\n\nasserts that requiring IMO to segregate defense costs and to\n\nidentify those utilized for actually covered claims would have\n\nno impact on the allocation process, and it would not be overly\n\ndifficult to apportion defense costs after the allocation is\n\ncompleted.\n\n    IMO responds that the excess insurers' policies promise to\n\npay for the costs of defending liabilities arising from covered\n\n\"occurrences,\" not covered \"claims.\"   It emphasizes that Owens-\n\nIllinois defines an \"occurrence\" to be the decision to\n\nmanufacture asbestos-containing products, not the exposure of a\n\nspecific claimant to an asbestos product.\n\n    IMO further asserts that the excess insurers have relied on\n\ncases that are not pertinent to the proper definition of\n\noccurrence, and that the differences between the law of New\n\nJersey and the law of New York and other states as to the nature\n\nof a covered occurrence distinguish the holdings of the case law\n\ncited by ACE and LMI.   IMO argues that the trial court's refusal\n\n\n\n\n                                67                         A-6240-10T1\n\fto parse defense costs between covered and uncovered claims\n\naccords with the realities of defending mass tort claims, where\n\nthe effective defense of meritless claims is part and parcel of\n\nthe defense of covered claims.\n\n    A representative provision of the many policies involved\n\nprovides that the insurer will indemnify the insured:\n\n         for all sums which the [in]sured shall be\n         obligated to pay by reason of the liability:\n         (a) imposed upon the [in]sured by law, or\n         (b) assumed under contract or agreement . .\n         . for damages on account of: (i) Personal\n         Injuries . . . caused by or arising out of\n         each occurrence . . . as defined in the\n         Underlying Umbrella Policies . . . .\n\n         [(Emphasis added).]\n\nA representative underlying policy covers damages and expenses\n\nfor the insured's \"ultimate net loss,\" which it defines as:\n\n         the total sum which the insured, or any\n         company as his insurer, or both becomes\n         obligated to pay by reason of personal\n         injury . . . either through adjudication or\n         compromise . . . expense for . . . lawyers .\n         . . and investigators and other persons and\n         for litigation, settlement, adjustment and\n         investigation of claims and suits which are\n         paid as a consequence of any occurrence\n         covered hereunder . . . .\n\n         [(Emphasis added).]\n\nThe excess insurers argue that the phrase \"be [or becomes]\n\nobligated to pay\" absolves them of paying for defending against\n\nclaims that are dismissed or adjudicated to be without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                 68                      A-6240-10T1\n\f    In a written report and recommendation dated March 27,\n\n2008, the SAM ruled that \"[t]he common straightforward reading\n\nof the language is that indemnification for defense related\n\nexpenses must be related to an occurrence.      If there is no\n\noccurrence then there can be no covered damages.\"      He observed\n\nthat New Jersey law defines the occurrence as IMO's decision to\n\nsell asbestos products, and concluded that all of IMO's defense\n\nexpenses flow from that decision.      He therefore recommended that\n\nthe court deny the excess insurers' motion and find that IMO is\n\nentitled to receive indemnity for all its defense expenses.\n\n    On the request of LMI and ACE for reconsideration, the SAM\n\nnoted: \"Mass-tort asbestos claims are defended very differently\n\nfrom the average claims,\" and some defendants choose to try\n\nquestionable cases to a conclusion in order to send a deterrent\n\nmessage to the plaintiffs' bar.    He also noted that applying\n\nLMI's and ACE's interpretation of an occurrence to each\n\nindividual claim would present a significant practical\n\nchallenge, in that it would impose an unworkable burden on IMO\n\nand require the expenditure of substantial judicial resources.\n\nHe added:\n\n            It is extremely difficult to see how\n            adjudicating LMI's policies' provision to\n            indemnify defense costs for only covered\n            claims would not hijack the allocation\n            process. While IMO should be required to\n            demonstrate that a claim does fall within a\n\n\n\n                                  69                         A-6240-10T1\n\f          given policy year, to require an evidentiary\n          process on thousands of claims to determine\n          their linkage to defense costs would be\n          unworkable and unmanageable. It would seem\n          extremely difficult to connect every defense\n          payment to a claim and to make a second\n          determination that the claim is, indeed, a\n          covered claim.\n\n    Judge Muir adopted the SAM's reasoning and ruling by an\n\norder dated November 4, 2009.\n\n    Both the excess policies and the underlying policies\n\nobligate the insurers to pay for damages arising out of an\n\n\"occurrence.\"   In Owens-Illinois, supra, 138 N.J. at 447, where\n\nthe insurers' policies had coverage and ultimate net loss\n\nprovisions virtually identical to those in this case, the Court\n\nrecited our conclusion that the manufacture and sale of the\n\nasbestos-containing product should be regarded as the single\n\noccurrence triggering liability for asbestos-related injuries or\n\ndamage.

Super. at 542 (manufacture\n\nand sale of asbestos-containing product constitutes single\n\noccurrence triggering liability).\n\n    The same result must follow here in the context of proving\n\ncoverage for each individual claimant.    The excess insurers'\n\nobligation to cover IMO's ultimate net losses, which include\n\ndefense costs, was triggered when IMO manufactured and sold\n\nasbestos-containing products and claimants became injured by\n\nthose products.    IMO's decision to trade in such products\n\nresulted in IMO paying damages to claimants following litigation\n\nor settlement.    Under the terms of the excess insurance\n\npolicies, LMI and ACE are required to indemnify IMO for the sums\n\nit expended in defending all those claims.\n\n    The conclusion that the excess insurers must reimburse IMO\n\nfor defense costs even if some of them were incurred to defend\n\nuncovered claims is also compelled by another aspect of Owens-\n\nIllinois.   As the SAM noted, the need to segregate and classify\n\ndefense costs according to each individual claim would greatly\n\ncomplicate the already complex allocation process.    Challenges\n\namong the parties as to whether particular claims were covered\n\nor uncovered would increase litigation and require additional\n\njudicial attention.

The court should examine\n\nthe legal claims and determine if they are \"so intertwined with\n\nthe equitable issues that the legal issues\" fall within the\n\nequity court's jurisdiction to decide them without a jury.\n\nBoardwalk Properties, supra, 253 N.J. Super. at 528.\n\n    Here, the original complaint focused on declaratory relief,\n\nalthough it also included prayers for compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages.   Primarily, IMO sought the court's aid in defining and\n\nfixing the obligations of Transamerica and TIG in relation to\n\nthe 1986 Distribution Agreement.     The crux of the complaint was\n\nthe alleged \"imminent\" exhaustion of the TIG insurance policies.\n\nThe defense costs and indemnification payments that IMO sought\n\nwere in connection with pending or future asbestos cases.\n\n    The second amended complaint named several dozen excess\n\ninsurers, but IMO still sought the same declaration of rights as\n\n\n\n\n                                77                          A-6240-10T1\n\fits original complaint and, further, a declaration of rights of\n\nIMO and the obligations of Transamerica in connection with the\n\nexcess insurers.   For the most part, the asbestos claims in\n\ndispute were either ongoing or future claims.\n\n    The twenty-four counts of the third amended complaint did\n\nnot change the primary relief sought.    IMO's bad faith claims\n\nwere rooted in the alleged wrongful abandonment of its defense\n\nand the failure to notify IMO in advance that certain insurance\n\npolicies were about to be exhausted.    Again, IMO was concerned\n\nthat defendants failed or \"will fail\" to fulfill their\n\nobligations under the insurance contracts, and have refused or\n\n\"will refuse\" to defend and indemnify IMO against asbestos\n\nclaims filed in New Jersey and other states.\n\n    All of IMO's pleadings sought declarations about the future\n\nobligations of defendants.   Any alleged claims of bad faith,\n\nwrongful abandonment, breach of fiduciary duty, or tortious\n\ninterference stem from whether the contractual rights alleged by\n\nIMO in fact existed.   From the outset and throughout the\n\nlitigation, IMO's complaints were mainly equitable.\n\n    Although additional causes of action for money damages may\n\nhave arisen after the filing of the initial complaint, those\n\nclaims are still intertwined with the primary events and the\n\nallegations presented in the original complaint.    See Eckerd\n\n\n\n\n                                78                          A-6240-10T1\n\fDrugs of N.J., Inc. v. S.R. 215, Rite-Aid Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526276\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526276/eckerd-drugs-of-nj-inc-v-sr-215-rite-aid-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

As we have stated, they are linked\n\nto the question of whether or not the Transamerica defendants\n\nand the excess insurers had an obligation to provide ongoing or\n\nfuture defense and indemnification, and an earlier notice of\n\nexhaustion.\n\n    IMO argues that none of its claims fell within the\n\nexceptions to the right to a jury trial as stated in In re\n\nEnvironmental, supra, 149 N.J. at 291-300.    In that case, the\n\nplaintiff was seeking a judgment declaring that the insurers\n\nwere required to indemnify and defend for future costs of an\n\nenvironmental remediation action.    Id. at 286.   The issue on\n\nappeal was whether a constitutional right to a jury trial\n\nexisted in a declaratory judgment action involving claims\n\nagainst insurers for breach of contract and recovery of future\n\ncosts where the plaintiff also sought compensatory damages for\n\npast costs.   Ibid.\n\n    The case was complex.    It involved dozens of insurance\n\ncompanies and estimated future costs that exceeded $1 billion.\n\nId. at 288-89.   The Supreme Court observed that the action was\n\nat its root a request for specific performance of the insurance\n\ncontracts because the plaintiff wished to be placed in the\n\nposition it would have enjoyed had the insurers performed on the\n\n\n\n\n                                79                          A-6240-10T1\n\finsurance contracts.    Id. at 293-95.    In addition, specific\n\nperformance was an appropriate remedy because several of the\n\nalleged breaches had not yet occurred, leaving the insured's\n\ndamages incalculable.     Id. at 296.   Therefore, the plaintiff did\n\nnot have a right to a jury trial.       Id. at 287, 295.   A court of\n\nequity could decide any ancillary legal issues and award money\n\ndamages for past losses.    Id. at 295.\n\n       Similarly in this case, there was no right to a jury trial\n\nbecause IMO's complaints presented a unique and complex mass-\n\ntort insurance coverage case focused on a declaration of the\n\nparties' rights and obligations and on the specific performance\n\nof insurance contracts as so declared.      In fact, the Court in In\n\nre Environmental observed that the predominance of equitable\n\nissues combined with the complexity of the subject matter\n\ndistinguished that case from other insurance actions.        Id. at\n\n298.   The same is true here.\n\n       IMO's breach of contract and bad faith claims grew out of\n\nthe same dispute and were intertwined with its equitable claims.\n\nThey were based on the same facts and proofs as the claims for\n\ndeclaratory judgment and specific performance.      They were\n\nproperly and economically adjudicated within the equity court's\n\nancillary jurisdiction.    Wood, supra, 206 N.J. at 575.\n\n\n\n\n                                  80                            A-6240-10T1\n\f    Additionally, this case is different from Ward v. Merrimack\n\nMutual Fire Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2162348\"><a href=\"/opinion/2162348/ward-v-merrimack-mut-fire-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

The\n\nplaintiff was not making claims for any future or ongoing\n\ninjury.   Ibid.\n\n    We conclude that Judge Muir did not err as a matter of law\n\nwhen he denied IMO's demand for a jury trial and decided the\n\nequitable matters and the ancillary legal issues by means of\n\nbench trials.\n\n\n    [At the court's direction, the remainder of this\n    opinion has been redacted for purposes of\n    publication.
