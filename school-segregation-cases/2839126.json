BORMAN, District Judge.                Plaintiff-Appellant Anthony D. Nicholson\n\n(“Nicholson”), who is an African-American, was formerly employed in the Parks and Recreation\n\nDepartment with the Defendant-Appellee City of Clarksville (“Clarksville”), Tennessee. He alleges\n\nthat, while employed by Clarksville, he was subjected to a racially hostile work environment, was\n\ndenied promotions based on his race, and was subject to retaliatory actions after he complained about\n\nracial discrimination.\n\n       Nicholson filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of\n\nTennessee on April 13, 2011, and an Amended Complaint on July 21, 2011. Nicholson alleged three\n\n\n\n*The Honorable Paul D. Borman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan,\nsitting by designation.\n\n                                                 1\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nclaims: (1) constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983; (2) violation of Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; and (3) violation of the Tennessee Human\n\nRights Act (“THRA”), Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-21-101 et seq. (2011).\n\n       On October 5, 2011, the district court granted Clarksville’s Motion for Partial Judgment on\n\nthe Pleadings, dismissing Nicholson’s claims under § 1983 and the THRA as barred by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations. Nicholson did not appeal this Order. Thus, only the Title VII claim\n\nremained at issue.\n\n       On July 2, 2012, Clarksville filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On September 12, 2012,\n\nthe district court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Clarksville’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. Nicholson filed a timely appeal on October 12, 2012.\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       Nicholson began working for Clarksville’s Parks and Recreation Department in 2004 as a\n\npart-time, seasonal employee, and was later promoted to a full-time “Maintenance I” position.\n\nNicholson claims that he witnessed, experienced or had knowledge of several different incidents\n\nduring his employment with Clarksville that evidence hostility towards African-American\n\nemployees.\n\nA. 2005 Incident\n\n       Sometime in 2005, a Caucasian assistant director for the Parks and Recreation Department\n\naddressed a group of employees, including Nicholson, by stating that if the employees did not\n\ncomplete their work their “asses were fired.” (R. 38, Resp. to Clarksville’s Statement of Undisputed\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nMaterial Facts (“SUMF”) ¶ 4, Page ID # 477.) The group of employees that the assistant director\n\naddressed with this comment included a Caucasian employee, Maintenance Department Supervisor\n\nGarry Harp. Nicholson was not disciplined in connection with this incident.\n\nB. 2007 Job Reassignment, “Cussing” Incidents and Reprimand\n\n       Nicholson’s job assignment was changed in 2007 to Heritage Park, where he worked under\n\na Caucasian supervisor named Richard Davis. Nicholson claims that the Maintenance Director,\n\nJames Crotty, told Davis to “work the shit out of [Nicholson] so that [Nicholson] would wind up\n\nquitting[.]” (R. 31-1, Exs. to Clarksville’s Mot. for Summ. J., Nicholson Dep. 141, Page ID # 250.)\n\nNicholson also claims that Davis hired a part-time employee named Bill, who “was, basically, there\n\nto watch [Nicholson] to see if he could find anything out on [Nicholson].” (Nicholson Dep. 141,\n\nPage ID # 250.)\n\n       Also in 2007, Nicholson claims that he was “cussed” by a white supervisor named James\n\nClark for returning late from a lunch break. Nicholson testified that he was told to ride with a\n\nCaucasian employee, Tim Bishop, during his lunch break, and that even though Bishop was\n\nresponsible for taking too long to return after lunch, Clark “cussed” Nicholson. (Nicholson Dep.\n\n128-29, Page ID # 242-43.) Nicholson received a written reprimand for this incident, which stated\n\nthat Nicholson was sitting in his truck, not Bishop’s, and that when Clark asked Nicholson to return\n\nto work, Nicholson responded “‘who the hell are you talking to,’ and proceeded arguing.”\n\n(Nicholson Dep., Ex. 11, Reprimand Memo, Page ID # 261.) Bishop did not receive a reprimand.\n\nNicholson testified that Clark later apologized and that the issue was resolved.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n               A.      I was told to ride with [Bishop]. So in the meantime, he was\n                       the driver of the truck, and it was his truck. Then we got back\n                       to the park. Why is -- James [Clark] came to me with it.\n                       James came to me, cussing me. And later, James apologized,\n                       and we was okay about it.\n\n               Q.      Resolved it?\n\n               A.      Yes sir.\n\n(Nicholson Dep. 129, Page ID # 243.)\n\n       Nicholson clarified at his deposition that his use of the word “cussed” refers to “[l]ittle\n\nstuff[,]” like coarse and “aggressive” language, and does not include racial slurs.\n\n               Q.      Now, when you say “cussed,” I mean, like -- you made\n                       reference several times to, get your ass out here or get your\n                       ass back to work, or you know, what the hell you doing. Is\n                       that the kind of stuff you’re talking about?\n\n               A.      Yeah. Little stuff like, you know, you can say other stuff with\n                       it. I just can’t recall what all was said, but it was cussing.\n\n                ....\n\n               A.      Yeah. If they use it -- I mean, it’s a certain time -- if you use\n                       it jokingly, okay, that’s fine. But aggressively, no, it’s not\n                       fine.\n\n(Nicholson Dep. 131, 133, Page ID # 241, 239.)\n\nC. Marlon Matthews Incidents\n\n       Nicholson also testified that he witnessed an incident where an African-American employee,\n\nMarlon Matthews, was “cussed” by a Caucasian employee, John Walk. Nicholson could not recall\n\nwhat Walk said to Matthews, and only remembered that it was “something dealing with work.”\n\n(Nicholson Dep. 131, Page ID # 241.)\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Matthews admitted at his deposition that he used racially derogatory language while working,\n\nand that he and Walk were “good friends” who “joke around.” (R. 31-4, Exs. to Clarksville’s Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J., Matthews Dep. 24-25, Page ID # 332-33.) Matthews stated that “pretty much\n\neverybody” he worked with used racial slurs, and that “[s]ome of it is not on a serious term.”\n\n(Mathews Dep. 24, Page ID # 332.) Mose Garrett, an African-American employee, also testified that\n\n“both African-American employees and Caucasian employees use the N-word[,]” and that it is most\n\noften used by employees who are “trash talking, [and] joking around.” (R. 40-5, Exs. to Nicholson’s\n\nResp. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Garrett Dep. 21, Page ID # 540.) Matthews testified that “one\n\nparticular person” used racially derogatory language around Matthews, and “[c]alled [Matthews] the\n\nN-word” to his face. (Matthews Dep. 19, Page ID # 330.) Matthews reported this individual to\n\nMaintenance Director James Crotty and the individual was terminated for the incident.\n\nD. Crotty Incidents\n\n       Nicholson claims that a Caucasian employee named Dutch Crotty, who was the brother of\n\nMaintenance Director James Crotty, used racial slurs. Specifically, Nicholson witnessed an incident\n\nin 2007 in which Dutch Crotty called a Caucasian female employee who was in a relationship with\n\nan African American a “nigger lover.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF, ¶ 10, Page ID # 478.)\n\n       An African-American employee named Donald Carney testified that he twice complained\n\nto James Crotty about Dutch Crotty’s use of racial slurs and racially derogatory jokes. Carney\n\ntestified that he was fired by James Crotty the first time Carney complained about Dutch Crotty.\n\nHowever, after Carney spoke to the Mayor of Clarksville, he was allowed to work for the remainder\n\nof the season.\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Carney complained about Dutch Crotty a second time after Carney heard Dutch refer to a\n\nCaucasian female employee as a “nigger lover.” James Crotty suspended both Carney and Dutch\n\nCrotty after this incident. Carney was not rehired as a seasonal employee the next year, but he was\n\nlater re-hired as a regular, full-time employee.\n\n       Nicholson claims that, in 2007, he heard James Crotty refer to an African-American\n\nemployee as “blue.” Nicholson testified that he believed Crotty’s use of the word “blue” was\n\noffensive and derogatory, because it referenced the employee’s skin color: “It was the color of his\n\nskin. He was real dark.” (Nicholson Dep. 109, Page ID # 549.) Clarksville employee Kevin\n\nCowling also testified that he believed “blue” was a racial slur when Crotty used the term. (R. 40-2,\n\nExs. to Nicholson’s Resp. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Cowling Dep. 92, Page ID # 525.)\n\n       James and Dutch Crotty were both terminated in November 2008 after an incident involving\n\nmoney received from the sale of scrap metal. Nicholson testified that he was aware of the incidents\n\nbetween Dutch Crotty and Carney, and believed that Carney was fired in connection with those\n\nincidents. Carney also testified that Dutch Crotty was the only employee he ever heard using racial\n\nslurs, and that he was satisfied with the way Clarksville handled the “situation” with Dutch Crotty.\n\n(Carney Dep. 18, 32, Page ID # 314, 318.)\n\nE. Song Lyrics Incident\n\n       At his deposition, Nicholson recalled an incident where he was riding with a Caucasian\n\nemployee, who was Garry Harp’s nephew, “[a]nd he was listening to a song, and he kept on -- and\n\nthe song had the N-word, and he kept on saying the N-word.” (Nicholson Dep. 147, Page ID. # 252.)\n\nNicholson asked the employee to stop using the “N-word,” and the employee stopped using the word\n\n                                                   6\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\naround Nicholson. (Id.) While the employee never used the word around Nicholson again,\n\nNicholson claims that he “heard he did it again.” (Nicholson Dep. 147-48, Page ID # 251-52.)\n\nF. Segregated Work Crew\n\n        Nicholson testified that, in 2008, he believed that a work crew at Heritage Park was\n\nsegregated by race by assigning the Caucasian employees to work on the soccer fields, on one side\n\nof the park, and assigning the African-American employees to work on the baseball fields, on the\n\nother side of the park. In response to Clarksville’s Interrogatories, Nicholson claimed that he\n\ncomplained to Clarksville management about the segregated work crew, but that “nothing was ever\n\ndone.” (R. 31-2, Nicholson’s Resp. to Clarksville’s Interrogatories ¶ 8, Page ID # 300.) However,\n\nNicholson does not dispute that Maintenance Department Supervisor Garry Harp spoke with\n\nmaintenance workers regarding the alleged segregation, and that “[Nicholson] and other maintenance\n\nworkers told Harp that the workers chose their own work area based on what they wanted to do and\n\nwho they wanted to work with, and that work assignments were not assigned based on race.” (R.\n\n31-8, Exs. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Harp Decl. ¶ 11, Page ID # 411; Resp. to Clarksville’s\n\nSUMF ¶ 44, Page ID # 483.)\n\n        Clarksville employee Lorenzo Wells testified that he worked on the baseball field because\n\n“[he] knew more about softball. [H]e really didn’t know too much about soccer at all.” (R. 31-9,\n\nExs. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Wells Dep. 21, Page ID # 415.) Wells also stated that he has\n\nasked Caucasian employees to help him with work on the baseball fields, and he has been asked to\n\nhelp on the soccer fields. Mose Garrett likewise testified that he has worked on both the soccer\n\nfields and baseball fields in the past.\n\n                                                7\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nG. 2008 Incidents\n\n       James Crotty changed Nicholson’s work assignment to the “trash truck” in 2008. Nicholson\n\ntestified that “at that time, I was going through my divorce, and [Crotty] knew, as far as I was trying\n\nto get my kids as much as I could. And out there at Heritage, you work a lot of weekends. So he\n\nwas, basically, trying to break me down.” (Nicholson Dep. 142, Page ID # 249.) Nicholson claimed\n\nthat he was required to log his hours and stay for a full eight-hour day while working on the trash\n\ntruck, while other employees were not required to log their hours, and would get paid for eight hours\n\nafter only working for four. James Crotty advised Nicholson that he would watch videos to make\n\nsure that Nicholson worked the full eight hours while assigned to the trash truck. Nicholson worked\n\non the trash truck for “a couple weeks” before he was taken off that assignment. (Nicholson Dep.\n\n142, Page ID # 249.)\n\n       Also in 2008, Nicholson witnessed Charlie Moody, a Caucasian employee, “physically kick\n\nan African American employee, Mose Garrett, in the butt.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶ 28, Page\n\nID # 481.) A Caucasian supervisor witnessed the incident and laughed, but took no disciplinary\n\naction. Nicholson later heard Moody say that he “was just playing with” Garrett (Nicholson Dep.\n\n136, Page ID # 236), and Garrett testified that Moody apologized for the incident three or four times,\n\nthat his apology was sincere, and that the incident never happened again.\n\nH. Noose Incidents\n\n       In November 2008, a maintenance crew found a noose hanging from a tree in a Clarksville\n\npark. Clarksville employee Marlon Matthews also found a noose in his work truck earlier that year.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nNicholson believed that a third noose was also found, but could not recall any details at his\n\ndeposition.\n\n        Derrick Oliver, an African-American park ranger with the Clarksville Parks and Recreation\n\nDepartment, conducted an investigation to determine who was responsible for hanging the nooses.\n\nA second investigation was also conducted by Bronson Gibbs, Clarksville’s Risk Manager. In\n\naddition, Clarksville’s request that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations perform its own\n\ninvestigation was granted. Nicholson stated that he was never interviewed as part of any of the\n\ninvestigations, but also conceded that he did not have any direct knowledge of who was responsible\n\nfor hanging the nooses. None of the investigations were able to identify the individual(s) responsible\n\nfor hanging the nooses.\n\n        In response to the noose incidents, Clarksville also initiated a city-wide sensitivity training\n\nprogram titled “Diversity and You.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶ 38, Page ID # 482.) Nicholson\n\nattended this training on February 10, 2009. Marlon Matthews testified that the Diversity and You\n\ntraining caused him to “curb[ his] language a whole lot after that.” (Matthews Dep. 35, Page ID #\n\n336.)\n\nI. Orville Sykes Incident\n\n        In January 2009, a Caucasian supervisor named Orville Sykes “cussed” Nicholson while\n\nNicholson was cutting down a tree with a chainsaw. Sykes told Nicholson, “boy you don’t know\n\nwhat you doing [sic],” and told Nicholson to “get [his] ass out of here.” (Nicholson’s Resp. to\n\nClarksville’s Interrogatory Request ¶ 13, Page ID # 304; Nicholson Dep. 65, Page ID # 217.) After\n\nSykes gave Nicholson “a verbal resume[,]” Nicholson turned off his chainsaw and handed it to\n\n                                                  9\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nSykes. (Nicholson Dep. 65-66, Page ID # 216-17.) Nicholson testified: “Orville Sykes was telling\n\nme about, hey, I’ve been chopping down trees for this long, that long. . . . So I figured he got more\n\nexperience, so I cut [the chainsaw] off; handed it to him.” (Id.) When Sykes began asking for\n\nNicholson’s name, Nicholson refused to answer because Sykes did not address him directly. The\n\nManager of Operations and Planning for the Parks and Recreation Department, Kevin Cowling,\n\nissued Nicholson a verbal reprimand for refusing to tell Sykes his name. However, Nicholson\n\ntestified that Cowling “said he would take care of [the reprimand], and I never knew -- I never heard\n\nanything else about that.” (Nicholson Dep. 66, Page ID # 216.)\n\nJ. Denial of Promotions\n\n       In May and October of 2009, Nicholson applied for two separate promotions to a\n\nMaintenance Worker II position. Nicholson could not recall at his deposition whether he was\n\ninterviewed for the Maintenance Worker II positions in 2009, but he did recall that he was previously\n\ninterviewed for a Maintenance Worker II position. (Nicholson Dep. 47, Page ID # 543.) Clarksville\n\ncontends that Nicholson was interviewed for the May 2009 position. Nicholson did not receive\n\neither promotion.\n\n       Maintenance Department Supervisor Garry Harp stated that Nicholson was not selected for\n\neither Maintenance Worker II position because he “did not possess all the skills necessary for the\n\nMaintenance II position, such as welding and plumbing.” (Harp Decl. ¶ 6, Page ID # 410.) Harp\n\nfurther attested to two opportunities that he had given Nicholson to demonstrate his welding and\n\nplumbing skills:\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n               One time, I allowed Mr. Nicholson to weld a broken gate [at] the fair\n               grounds. Mr. Nicholson did not repair it correctly the first time, and\n               I gave him a second chance to do it. In total, Mr. Nicholson took two\n               days to weld the gate, requiring me to give him overtime pay, and the\n               gate was still not properly repaired when he finished. Then, I asked\n               Marlon Matthews, a Maintenance II employee, to repair it and he\n               fixed it correctly in a very short period of time.\n\n                       Another time, Mr. Nicholson attempted to repair a faucet to\n               demonstrate his basic plumbing skills, which are also required of a\n               Maintenance II worker. He took the fixture apart, but was unable to\n               repair or put it back together. He left the faucet open and\n               disassembled overnight before telling me the next day that he could\n               not fix it.\n\n(Harp Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, Page ID # 410.)\n\n       Nicholson admitted that the gate broke the first time he tried to fix it. However, Nicholson\n\navers that he told Harp that he could not fully repair the gate initially because he needed additional\n\nparts. Nicholson also admitted that Marlon Matthews put the gate up again later, but claims that it\n\nbroke again afterward. Nicholson believes that the gate was breaking because “somebody was . . .\n\njust hitting it or something.” (Nicholson Dep. 49, Page ID # 544.) Nicholson also stated that he was\n\ntold he did not get the two Maintenance Worker II promotions because he had high blood pressure\n\nand because his Commercial Drivers License was invalid.\n\n       Nicholson stated that he spoke to Garry Harp about a Maintenance Worker II position that\n\nhe applied for in 2010, and Harp told Nicholson that he did not receive the position because of a\n\nback injury Nicholson had sustained while working. Nicholson also spoke to Garry Harp about a\n\nsupervisor opening, and Harp told Nicholson not to apply for the position “because [he] wouldn’t\n\nget it.” (Nicholson’s Resp. to Clarksville’s Interrogatories ¶ 9, Page ID # 302.)\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n         Mose Garrett testified that he had previously applied for a Maintenance Worker II position,\n\nbut a Caucasian employee named Tommy Little, who only had experience in swimming pool\n\nmaintenance, received the promotion instead. However, it is undisputed that other African-American\n\nemployees were promoted. Marlon Matthews was promoted from a Maintenance Worker I to a\n\nMaintenance Worker II position.       In 2010, an African-American employee named William\n\nHumphrey was promoted from Maintenance Worker I to a supervisory position as Department Crew\n\nChief.\n\n         In September 2010, Nicholson received a performance evaluation from his supervisor,\n\nRichard Davis, rating his performance as “meets expectations.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶¶\n\n111-12, Page ID # 494.) Davis changed his rating of Nicholson to “unsatisfactory” after Cowling\n\ntold Davis that the evaluation should reflect Nicholson’s performance throughout the entire year.\n\nCowling testified that he did not believe Davis’s initial evaluation of Nicholson as “meets\n\nexpectations” was accurate, because “Mr. Davis had expressed to [Cowling], on several occasions\n\nthroughout the year, that, you know, he had problems with [Nicholson] not wanting to do some\n\nthings, or not communicating, or asking why other people couldn’t do that if he didn’t want to do\n\nsomething.” (Cowling Dep. 108-09, Page ID # 406-07.) Nicholson was terminated in 2011.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n         This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Allen v. Highlands\n\nHosp. Corp., 545 F.3d 387, 393 (6th Cir. 2008). Summary judgment is proper under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(a) where “the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” The facts must be viewed, and all reasonable\n\n                                                 12\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\ninferences must be drawn, in favor of the nonmoving party. Pennington v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\n\nCo., 553 F.3d 447, 450 (6th Cir. 2009) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n\n475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)). The Court must ultimately determine “whether the evidence presents a\n\nsufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party\n\nmust prevail as a matter of law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Nicholson argues that the district court erred when it found no genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to Nicholson’s hostile work environment, failure to promote, and retaliation claims. Nicholson\n\ncontends that the discrete incidents of harassment he has alleged, when considered under the totality\n\nof the circumstances, were sufficient to alter the terms and conditions of his employment with\n\nClarksville. Nicholson also argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nClarksville’s claimed reasons for denying him promotions were pretextual, and that Clarksville\n\nengaged in retaliatory conduct in response to Nicholson’s formal and informal complaints about\n\nracial discrimination in the workplace.\n\nA. Hostile Work Environment\n\n       Nicholson’s hostile work environment claims under § 1981 and Title VII are subject to the\n\nsame standards. Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647, 658 (6th Cir. 1999). To establish a hostile\n\nwork environment claim, Nicholson must show “(1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he\n\nwas subject to unwelcomed harassment; (3) the harassment was race-based; (4) the harassment\n\nunreasonably interfered with his work performance by creating an environment that was\n\nintimidating, hostile, or offensive; and (5) [Clarksville] was liable for the harassing conduct.” Kuhn\n\n                                                 13\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nv. Washtenaw County, 709 F.3d 612, 627 (6th Cir. 2013). The United States Supreme Court has\n\nnoted that harassing conduct “must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions\n\nof employment[.]” Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998). “[S]imple teasing,\n\noffhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious)” do not create a hostile work\n\nenvironment. Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). “These standards for judging\n\nhostility are sufficiently demanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a general civility code.”\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In evaluating a hostile work environment claim, the Court looks to the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, “considering even those claims that were not directed at a particular plaintiff and\n\nthose claims that a particular plaintiff did not witness.” Berryman v. SuperValu Holdings, Inc., 669\n\nF.3d 714, 718 (6th Cir. 2012). However, while a plaintiff need not be the subject of, or a witness\n\nto, harassing behavior, “he does need to know about it.” Id.\n\n        Factors relevant to a hostile work environment claim “may include the frequency of the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere\n\noffensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.”\n\nHarris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993).\n\n        Relying on Jackson, supra, Nicholson argues that the actions taken by Clarksville employees\n\nand supervisors, when considered together, were sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile\n\nwork environment claim. In Jackson, the plaintiff, an African-American woman, produced evidence\n\nshowing, inter alia, frequent use of racial slurs by co-workers and supervisors, racist graffiti in rest\n\nrooms depicting lynchings and the phrase “KKK is back,” the phrase “Blacks out back” on a door\n\n                                                  14\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nat the employer’s plant for at least two years, defacement of an African-American employee’s work\n\nshirt by writing the words “N----- Sucker” over his name, and different treatment for Caucasian and\n\nAfrican-American employees in terms of on-the-job training and opportunities for advancement.\n\nJackson, 191 F.3d at 651-54. The Jackson plaintiff was also called a “n----- bitch” and physically\n\nassaulted by a Caucasian co-worker. Id. at 655. After the plaintiff took a leave of absence due to\n\nthe assault, the employee who had assaulted her came to work wearing a hard hat with a swastika\n\non it. Id. Throughout the plaintiff’s employment, her employer demonstrated “a pattern of\n\nunresponsiveness . . . to the complaints of its African-American employees[.]” Id. at 665. This\n\nCourt found that, in considering the totality of the circumstances, including instances of racial\n\nharassment that were not directed specifically at the plaintiff, the trial court erred when it granted\n\njudgement as a matter of law in favor of the employer. Id. at 668.\n\n       Clarksville argues that Nicholson’s evidence only shows isolated incidents of general\n\nprofanity, and the few incidents involving racial slurs are insufficient to create a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. Clarksville asserts that sporadic and isolated comments by employees cannot\n\namount to “extreme” conduct that changes the terms and conditions of employment. Clarksville\n\nfurther argues that Nicholson’s hostile work environment claim fails because he cannot show that\n\nClarksville had knowledge of the alleged racial harassment and failed to act.\n\n       The district court properly determined that Nicholson had failed to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact on his hostile work environment claim. Most of the incidents relied on by Nicholson\n\nonly involved coarse language used by Clarksville employees, and did not evidence racial animus.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Nicholson admits that the 2005 incident, where an assistant manager told a group of\n\nemployees that their “asses were fired” if they did not complete their work, involved coarse language\n\ndirected at both African-American and Caucasian employees. This incident, which involved no\n\nracial slurs, cannot be construed as evidencing a racially hostile work environment.\n\n       As to 2007, Nicholson cannot recall what language John Walk used when he “cussed”\n\nMarlon Matthews. Absent any indication of racial hostility, this incident does not support\n\nNicholson’s claim of a racially hostile work environment.\n\n       Nicholson claims that his 2007 written reprimand by his supervisor, James Clark, evidences\n\nracial animus, because Clark did not also reprimand Tim Bishop, Nicholson’s Caucasian co-worker,\n\nwho also arrived late after lunch. However, the reprimand submitted into evidence reflects that\n\nNicholson was reprimanded for arguing with his supervisor, not for arriving late after lunch.\n\nNicholson does not claim that Bishop also argued with Clark and was not reprimanded.\n\nFurthermore, Nicholson admits that Clark later apologized for the reprimand and the issue was\n\nresolved to Nicholson’s satisfaction.\n\n       Similarly, there is no indication that the 2008 kicking incident involving Mose Garrett and\n\nCharlie Moody was motivated by racial animus, and Garrett testified that Moody sincerely\n\napologized after the incident.\n\n       Although Nicholson initially complained about the alleged segregation of a work crew in\n\n2008, he admits that he later told the Maintenance Department Supervisor that the work crew\n\nactually chose their own work assignments, and employees were not assigned to the baseball or\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nsoccer fields based on their race. Further, there was testimony that each crew also worked on the\n\nother crew’s field – baseball and soccer.\n\n        The evidence reflects four instances of racial slurs between the years 2007 and 2009. Only\n\none of these incidents involved language specifically directed at Nicholson – the 2009 incident in\n\nwhich Orville Sykes referred to Nicholson as “boy.” Nicholson was aware of two racial slurs in\n\n2007 – Dutch Crotty referring to a female employee as a “nigger lover,” and James Crotty referring\n\nto an African-American employee as “blue.” Both Crottys were subsequently terminated by\n\nClarksville. Nicholson also recalls an incident where he rode in a truck with a Caucasian employee\n\nand heard him singing along with a song that used the “N-word.” When Nicholson asked him to stop\n\nsinging along around Nicholson, the employee complied.\n\n        These four isolated instances over the course of two years, while inappropriate and offensive,\n\nare not so severe and pervasive as to alter the terms and conditions of Nicholson’s employment. See\n\nFarragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (noting that “isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not\n\namount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’”); see also\n\nArmstrong v. Whirlpool Corp., 363 F. App’x 317, 327 (6th Cir. 2010) (affirming district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment on hostile work environment claim involving “a handful of uses of the\n\nn-word and its derivatives, . . . some racist jokes . . ., a few references . . . to the Ku Klux Klan and\n\nJames Earl Ray, and the presence of racist graffiti that was removed as soon as [the plaintiff]\n\nreported it to a supervisor.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n        Nicholson argues that the totality of circumstances should include Clarksville’s failure to\n\npromote Nicholson, unwarranted disciplinary actions, and alleged retaliation. Even considering\n\n                                                   17\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nthese facts, however, Nicholson still fails to establish a hostile work environment claim. As\n\ndiscussed infra, there is no evidence that Clarksville denied Nicholson’s requests for promotion to\n\nthe Maintenance Worker II position because of Nicholson’s race. Likewise, there is no evidence that\n\nany disciplinary actions taken by Clarksville were unwarranted, or that Nicholson was disciplined\n\nmore harshly based on his race. Furthermore, if the 2008 noose incidents are considered as part of\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, they are insufficient to support a hostile work environment claim\n\nbecause there is no evidence that Clarksville employees hung the nooses. Indeed, the undisputed\n\nevidence shows that the nooses were immediately removed after they were discovered, that\n\nClarksville initiated two separate investigations seeking to identify the individual or individuals who\n\nhung the nooses, and also requested a third investigation from the Tennessee Bureau of\n\nInvestigations.   Further, the evidence establishes that in response to these noose incidents,\n\nClarksville held a diversity sensitivity training program for its employees.\n\n       Nicholson testified that he was aware that Donald Carney was suspended after he complained\n\nabout Dutch Crotty’s use of racial slurs, and that Carney was not rehired by Clarksville as a seasonal\n\nemployee the year after. However, Carney was later hired as a full-time, permanent employee at\n\nClarksville. As noted supra, both Dutch Crotty and his brother, James Crotty, were terminated by\n\nClarksville. Viewed as a whole, these facts do not imply a severe and pervasive hostility towards\n\nAfrican-American employees.\n\n       Viewing the totality of the circumstances, Nicholson has failed to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to whether the discriminatory conduct alleged was so severe and pervasive that\n\nit altered the terms and conditions of Nicholson’s employment. The district court therefore did not\n\n                                                  18\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nerr by entering summary judgment in Clarksville’s favor on Nicholson’s hostile work environment\n\nclaim.1\n\n\n\nB. Failure to Promote\n\n          To establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination on a failure to promote claim,\n\nNicholson must establish that: “(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he applied and was\n\nqualified for a promotion; (3) he was considered for and denied the promotion; and (4) other\n\nemployees of similar qualifications who were not members of the protected class received\n\npromotions.” Dews v. A.B. Dick Co., 231 F.3d 1016, 1020-21 (6th Cir. 2000). If Nicholson\n\nestablishes a prima facie case, he is entitled to a presumption of discrimination unless Clarksville\n\nproffers “a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.” Id. at 1021. The burden then\n\nshifts back to Nicholson to show that Clarksville’s “proffered reason is pretextual.” Id. (citing\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973) and St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v.\n\nHicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11 (1993)).\n\n          Clarksville contends, in a footnote, that Nicholson has failed to establish a prima facie case\n\nbecause he cannot show that he was qualified for the Maintenance Worker II position. (Appellee’s\n\nBr. at 27 n. 15.) This issue was similarly argued by Clarksville in the district court, which noted that\n\nClarksville “asserts in a single sentence, without any explanation, that the plaintiff failed to establish\n\na prima facie case of discrimination because he was not qualified for the open M2 positions.” (Sept.\n\n\n          1\n          Because Nicholson’s hostile work environment claim was properly dismissed by the\ndistrict court, we do not address Clarksville’s alternate argument regarding supervisor liability.\n\n                                                   19\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n12, 2012 Memorandum Op. 18 n. 11, Page ID # 620.) Clarksville’s assertion that Nicholson cannot\n\nestablish a prima facie case is unsupported by any law or analysis, and is therefore waived. “Issues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are\n\ndeemed waived. It is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal\n\nway, leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.” McPherson v. Kelsey, 125 F.3d 989, 995-96 (6th\n\nCir. 1997) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        The argument in both Nicholson’s and Clarksville’s briefs focuses on whether Nicholson has\n\nproduced evidence showing that Clarksville’s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is\n\npretextual. “A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the proffered reason (1) has no\n\nbasis in fact, (2) did not actually motivate the defendant’s challenged conduct, or (3) was insufficient\n\nto warrant the challenged conduct.” Dews, 231 F.3d at 1021. Nicholson bears “the ultimate burden\n\nof producing sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably reject [Clarksville’s]\n\nexplanation and infer that [Clarksville] intentionally discriminated against him.” Johnson v. Kroger\n\nCo., 319 F.3d 858, 866 (6th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Clarksville asserts that Nicholson was not promoted to a Maintenance Worker II position\n\nbecause he failed to demonstrate the required welding and plumbing skills, and because he was\n\nargumentative and resisted directives from his superiors. Nicholson attempts to show that this\n\nreason is a mere pretext for discrimination by relying on several different facts.\n\n        Nicholson first contends that he made complaints to his supervisors regarding racial\n\ndiscrimination, and subsequently applied for promotions “but was not even interviewed each time.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. at 30.) However, Nicholson admitted at his deposition that he had been interviewed\n\n                                                  20\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nfor a Maintenance Worker II position. (Nicholson Dep. 47, Page ID # 543.) Nicholson also does\n\nnot dispute that a gate he was asked to fix collapsed after he tack welded it on two different\n\noccasions, and that it was ultimately fixed correctly by Marlon Matthews “in a very short period of\n\ntime.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶¶ 74-75.) While Nicholson stated that he believes that\n\n“somebody was . . . just hitting [the gate]” (Nicholson Dep. 49, Page ID # 544), Nicholson’s\n\nsubjective belief as to why the gate collapsed does not establish that Clarksville’s reasons for\n\ndenying Nicholson a promotion were a mere pretext in light of the undisputed facts in the record.\n\n       Nicholson also notes that Garry Harp told him not to apply for a promotion because he would\n\nnot get it, but Nicholson does not show that Harp’s comment was based on racial animus. This fact,\n\nstanding alone, does not evidence that Clarksville’s proffered reasons for denying Nicholson’s\n\npromotions are a pretext.\n\n       Nicholson next appears to argue that one of the Caucasian employees who received a\n\npromotion to the Maintenance Worker II position was less qualified than Nicholson because he did\n\nnot have a Commercial Drivers License (“CDL”), which was a requirement for the position.\n\nHowever, Clarksville’s promotion of Marlon Matthews to a Maintenance Worker II position\n\nundermines this argument. Matthews, who is African American, was allowed to obtain a CDL after\n\nhe was promoted. As stated by the district court, “to the extent that the defendant failed to\n\nconsistently apply its requirement mandating possession of a commercial driver’s license, it did so\n\nin such a way that both white and African American employees benefitted.” (Sept. 12, 2012\n\nMemorandum Op. 21, Page ID # 623.)\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Nicholson argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to pretext based on the action\n\nof his supervisor, Richard Davis, changing his employee evaluation in 2010 from “meets\n\nexpectations” to “unsatisfactory.” Nicholson admits, though, that Kevin Cowling did not think the\n\ninitial evaluation was accurate, and asked Davis to change Nicholson’s evaluation to reflect his\n\nperformance throughout the year. Nicholson does not produce any evidence tending to show that\n\nCowling’s request was based on racial animus.\n\n       Nicholson has failed to produce sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact as to whether\n\nClarksville’s proffered reasons for denying his promotion to the Maintenance Worker II position\n\nwere pretextual. The district court’s grant of summary judgment on Nicholson’s failure to promote\n\nclaim is therefore affirmed.\n\nC. Retaliation\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Nicholson must demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that (1) he engaged in a protected activity under Title VII, (2)\n\nNicholson’s protected activity was known to Clarksville, (3) Clarksville took adverse employment\n\nactions against Nicholson, and (4) there was a causal connection between the adverse employment\n\naction and the protected activity. Taylor v. Geithner, 703 F.3d 328, 336 (6th Cir. 2013). “The\n\nburden of establishing a prima facie case in a retaliation action is not onerous, but one easily met.”\n\nMickey v. Zeidler Tool and Die Co., 516 F.3d 516, 523 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). If Nicholson establishes a prima facie case, Clarksville then has the burden of production\n\nand must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Fuhr v. Hazel Park School\n\nDist., 710 F.3d 668, 674 (6th Cir. 2013). “If a defendant successfully produces such a legitimate\n\n                                                  22\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nreason, then the burden of production returns to the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that the proffered reason was a mere pretext for discrimination.” Id. at 675.\n\nFurthermore, the United States Supreme Court recently clarified that a Title VII plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate “but for” causation to sustain a retaliation claim.\n\n               Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional\n               principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated\n               in § 2000e-2(m). This requires proof that the unlawful retaliation\n               would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action\n               or actions of the employer.\n\nUniv. of Tex. Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2013 WL 3155234, at *14 (June\n\n24, 2013).2\n\n       Nicholson argues that he “made a number of complaints to his supervisors concerning racial\n\ndiscrimination in the workplace starting with his report of segregation in 2008.” (Appellant’s Br.\n\n35.) However, Nicholson has not produced any evidence of further complaints he made about racial\n\ndiscrimination after he complained about the segregated work crew in Heritage Park. The district\n\ncourt nevertheless noted that “the record evidence shows that the plaintiff filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) on March 27,\n\n2009.” (Sept. 12, 2012 Memorandum Op. 25, Page ID # 627.) Therefore, Nicholson’s complaint\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         We need not address whether the Nassar holding regarding Title VII retaliation applies\nas well to Nicholson’s § 1981 retaliation claim because Nicholson cannot satisfy even the\ncausation requirement for Title VII retaliation claims under the pre-Nassar law that our Circuit\nhas applied to § 1981 claims. See Bobo v. United Parcel Servs., 665 F.3d 741, 756-57 (6th Cir.\n2012) (analyzing Title VII and § 1981 claims for retaliation using motivating-factor standard and\nPrice Waterhouse burden shifting).\n\n                                                 23\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nregarding the segregated work crew in 2008 and his March 27, 2009 EEOC charge are the only\n\nprotected activities at issue.\n\n        Clarksville argues that, assuming Nicholson’s complaint in 2008 constitutes protected\n\nactivity, Nicholson cannot show a “causal connection” between that protected activity and any\n\nalleged adverse employment actions.\n\n        Nicholson relies on temporal proximity to establish a causal connection between his\n\nprotected activity and the alleged adverse employment actions taken by Clarksville. “One way by\n\nwhich a plaintiff can demonstrate a causal connection is to show close temporal proximity between\n\nthe adverse employment actions and the protected activity.” Taylor, 703 F.3d at 339. But a prima\n\nfacie case based on temporal proximity alone requires a short period of time between the protected\n\nactivity and the adverse employment action, “usually less than six months.” Nguyen v. City of\n\nCleveland, 229 F.3d 559, 567 (6th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). As this Court\n\nnoted in Mickey, supra:\n\n                Where an adverse employment action occurs very close in time after\n                an employer learns of a protected activity, such temporal proximity\n                between the events is significant enough to constitute evidence of a\n                causal connection for the purposes of satisfying a prima facie case of\n                retaliation. But where some time elapses between when the employer\n                learns of a protected activity and the subsequent adverse employment\n                action, the employee must couple temporal proximity with other\n                evidence of retaliatory conduct to establish causality.\n\n516 F.3d at 525. In Cooper v. City of North Olmstead, 795 F.2d 1265 (6th Cir. 1986), this Court\n\nfound that “[t]he mere fact that Cooper was discharged four months after filing a discrimination\n\nclaim is insufficient to support an [inference] of retaliation.” Id. at 1272.\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n          Regarding Nicholson’s complaint about the segregated work crew, he states only that he\n\nmade the complaint sometime in 2008 and has not produced evidence approximating a more specific\n\ndate. Because Nicholson relies on temporal proximity to establish the causal connection element of\n\nhis prima facie case of retaliation, he bears the burden of establishing temporal proximity by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Taylor, 703 F.3d at 336. Nicholson has failed to produce evidence\n\neven approximating when he made his complaint in 2008, and therefore cannot establish a prima\n\nfacie case of retaliation with respect to his 2008 complaint.\n\n          The only other protected activity evidenced in the record is Nicholson’s March 27, 2009\n\nEEOC charge. After he filed this charge, Nicholson asserts that Clarksville engaged in adverse\n\nemployment activities by declining to promote him in May and October of 2009, by changing his\n\nperformance evaluation in September 2010, and by subjecting him to unwarranted disciplinary\n\naction.\n\n          The October 2009 denial of promotion occurred more than six months after Nicholson\n\nengaged in protected activity, and the changes to Nicholson’s performance evaluation in September\n\n2010 occurred 18 months after the protected activity. A time period greater than six months, without\n\nmore, is not a sufficiently short period of time to satisfy the causal connection element of a\n\nretaliation claim. See Cooper, 795 F.2d at 1272; see also Clay v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 501\n\nF.3d 695, 718 (6th Cir. 2007) (finding no causal connection where gap between protected activity\n\nand adverse employment action was six months); Cecil v. Louisville Water Co., 301 F. App’x 490,\n\n502 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that adverse employment activity that occurred 10 months and 17\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nmonths after protected activity was insufficient, on its own, “to create a reasonable inference of\n\ncausation.”).\n\n        The approximately two-month gap between Nicholson’s protected activity on March 27,\n\n2009, and the denial of promotion in May 2009, may be sufficient to show a causal connection. See\n\nDye v. Office of the Racing Comm’n, 702 F.3d 286, 306 (6th Cir. 2012) (holding that “[a] lapse of\n\ntwo months, as is the case here, is sufficient to show a causal connection, and the district court erred\n\nin holding otherwise.”); but see Warf v. U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, 713 F.3d 874, 880 (6th Cir.\n\n2013) (finding that the plaintiff had not established a prima facie case of retaliation where failure to\n\npromote occurred one month after the plaintiff’s protected activity, because “only one of the\n\nsupervisors [who had knowledge of the protected activity] was on the selection committee for the\n\nposition and the rest of the selection committee did not have any knowledge of her complaint[,]” and\n\n“the selection committee considered Warf for the position . . . .”).\n\n        Assuming that Nicholson has established a prima facie case of retaliation based on the\n\ntemporal proximity between his March 2009 EEOC charge and the May 2009 denial of promotion,\n\nhis retaliation claim fails because he cannot demonstrate that Clarksville’s proffered legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for its denial of promotion were a pretext for retaliation. As discussed\n\nabove, Clarksville has produced evidence that it did not promote Nicholson to the Maintenance\n\nWorker II position because he lacked the requisite welding and plumbing skills, and because he was\n\nargumentative and resisted directives from his supervisors. Nicholson has failed to show that these\n\nreasons are a mere pretext.\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n        Nicholson argues that summary judgment is not appropriate in this matter because\n\nClarksville’s true motivations for its actions are difficult to ascertain. See Singfield v. Akron\n\nMetropolitan Housing Authority, 389 F.3d 555, 564 (6th Cir. 2004) (noting “that in discrimination\n\nand retaliation cases, an employer’s true motivations are particularly difficult to ascertain . . . thereby\n\nfrequently making such factual determinations unsuitable for disposition at the summary judgment\n\nstage . . . .”). However, in Singfield, the plaintiff produced evidence showing that, but for the\n\ndefendant’s alleged retaliation, it would not have discovered its alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons for terminating his employment. Id. Nicholson has failed to produce similar evidence of\n\nbut-for causation in the instant matter. His retaliation claim was therefore properly dismissed. See\n\nNassar, supra.\n\n                                                   IV.\n\n        For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    27\n\f",

BORMAN, District Judge.                Plaintiff-Appellant Anthony D. Nicholson\n\n(“Nicholson”), who is an African-American, was formerly employed in the Parks and Recreation\n\nDepartment with the Defendant-Appellee City of Clarksville (“Clarksville”), Tennessee. He alleges\n\nthat, while employed by Clarksville, he was subjected to a racially hostile work environment, was\n\ndenied promotions based on his race, and was subject to retaliatory actions after he complained about\n\nracial discrimination.\n\n       Nicholson filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of\n\nTennessee on April 13, 2011, and an Amended Complaint on July 21, 2011. Nicholson alleged three\n\n\n\n*The Honorable Paul D. Borman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan,\nsitting by designation.\n\n                                                 1\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nclaims: (1) constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983; (2) violation of Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; and (3) violation of the Tennessee Human\n\nRights Act (“THRA”), Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-21-101 et seq. (2011).\n\n       On October 5, 2011, the district court granted Clarksville’s Motion for Partial Judgment on\n\nthe Pleadings, dismissing Nicholson’s claims under § 1983 and the THRA as barred by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations. Nicholson did not appeal this Order. Thus, only the Title VII claim\n\nremained at issue.\n\n       On July 2, 2012, Clarksville filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On September 12, 2012,\n\nthe district court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Clarksville’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. Nicholson filed a timely appeal on October 12, 2012.\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       Nicholson began working for Clarksville’s Parks and Recreation Department in 2004 as a\n\npart-time, seasonal employee, and was later promoted to a full-time “Maintenance I” position.\n\nNicholson claims that he witnessed, experienced or had knowledge of several different incidents\n\nduring his employment with Clarksville that evidence hostility towards African-American\n\nemployees.\n\nA. 2005 Incident\n\n       Sometime in 2005, a Caucasian assistant director for the Parks and Recreation Department\n\naddressed a group of employees, including Nicholson, by stating that if the employees did not\n\ncomplete their work their “asses were fired.” (R. 38, Resp. to Clarksville’s Statement of Undisputed\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nMaterial Facts (“SUMF”) ¶ 4, Page ID # 477.) The group of employees that the assistant director\n\naddressed with this comment included a Caucasian employee, Maintenance Department Supervisor\n\nGarry Harp. Nicholson was not disciplined in connection with this incident.\n\nB. 2007 Job Reassignment, “Cussing” Incidents and Reprimand\n\n       Nicholson’s job assignment was changed in 2007 to Heritage Park, where he worked under\n\na Caucasian supervisor named Richard Davis. Nicholson claims that the Maintenance Director,\n\nJames Crotty, told Davis to “work the shit out of [Nicholson] so that [Nicholson] would wind up\n\nquitting[.]” (R. 31-1, Exs. to Clarksville’s Mot. for Summ. J., Nicholson Dep. 141, Page ID # 250.)\n\nNicholson also claims that Davis hired a part-time employee named Bill, who “was, basically, there\n\nto watch [Nicholson] to see if he could find anything out on [Nicholson].” (Nicholson Dep. 141,\n\nPage ID # 250.)\n\n       Also in 2007, Nicholson claims that he was “cussed” by a white supervisor named James\n\nClark for returning late from a lunch break. Nicholson testified that he was told to ride with a\n\nCaucasian employee, Tim Bishop, during his lunch break, and that even though Bishop was\n\nresponsible for taking too long to return after lunch, Clark “cussed” Nicholson. (Nicholson Dep.\n\n128-29, Page ID # 242-43.) Nicholson received a written reprimand for this incident, which stated\n\nthat Nicholson was sitting in his truck, not Bishop’s, and that when Clark asked Nicholson to return\n\nto work, Nicholson responded “‘who the hell are you talking to,’ and proceeded arguing.”\n\n(Nicholson Dep., Ex. 11, Reprimand Memo, Page ID # 261.) Bishop did not receive a reprimand.\n\nNicholson testified that Clark later apologized and that the issue was resolved.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n               A.      I was told to ride with [Bishop]. So in the meantime, he was\n                       the driver of the truck, and it was his truck. Then we got back\n                       to the park. Why is -- James [Clark] came to me with it.\n                       James came to me, cussing me. And later, James apologized,\n                       and we was okay about it.\n\n               Q.      Resolved it?\n\n               A.      Yes sir.\n\n(Nicholson Dep. 129, Page ID # 243.)\n\n       Nicholson clarified at his deposition that his use of the word “cussed” refers to “[l]ittle\n\nstuff[,]” like coarse and “aggressive” language, and does not include racial slurs.\n\n               Q.      Now, when you say “cussed,” I mean, like -- you made\n                       reference several times to, get your ass out here or get your\n                       ass back to work, or you know, what the hell you doing. Is\n                       that the kind of stuff you’re talking about?\n\n               A.      Yeah. Little stuff like, you know, you can say other stuff with\n                       it. I just can’t recall what all was said, but it was cussing.\n\n                ....\n\n               A.      Yeah. If they use it -- I mean, it’s a certain time -- if you use\n                       it jokingly, okay, that’s fine. But aggressively, no, it’s not\n                       fine.\n\n(Nicholson Dep. 131, 133, Page ID # 241, 239.)\n\nC. Marlon Matthews Incidents\n\n       Nicholson also testified that he witnessed an incident where an African-American employee,\n\nMarlon Matthews, was “cussed” by a Caucasian employee, John Walk. Nicholson could not recall\n\nwhat Walk said to Matthews, and only remembered that it was “something dealing with work.”\n\n(Nicholson Dep. 131, Page ID # 241.)\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Matthews admitted at his deposition that he used racially derogatory language while working,\n\nand that he and Walk were “good friends” who “joke around.” (R. 31-4, Exs. to Clarksville’s Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J., Matthews Dep. 24-25, Page ID # 332-33.) Matthews stated that “pretty much\n\neverybody” he worked with used racial slurs, and that “[s]ome of it is not on a serious term.”\n\n(Mathews Dep. 24, Page ID # 332.) Mose Garrett, an African-American employee, also testified that\n\n“both African-American employees and Caucasian employees use the N-word[,]” and that it is most\n\noften used by employees who are “trash talking, [and] joking around.” (R. 40-5, Exs. to Nicholson’s\n\nResp. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Garrett Dep. 21, Page ID # 540.) Matthews testified that “one\n\nparticular person” used racially derogatory language around Matthews, and “[c]alled [Matthews] the\n\nN-word” to his face. (Matthews Dep. 19, Page ID # 330.) Matthews reported this individual to\n\nMaintenance Director James Crotty and the individual was terminated for the incident.\n\nD. Crotty Incidents\n\n       Nicholson claims that a Caucasian employee named Dutch Crotty, who was the brother of\n\nMaintenance Director James Crotty, used racial slurs. Specifically, Nicholson witnessed an incident\n\nin 2007 in which Dutch Crotty called a Caucasian female employee who was in a relationship with\n\nan African American a “nigger lover.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF, ¶ 10, Page ID # 478.)\n\n       An African-American employee named Donald Carney testified that he twice complained\n\nto James Crotty about Dutch Crotty’s use of racial slurs and racially derogatory jokes. Carney\n\ntestified that he was fired by James Crotty the first time Carney complained about Dutch Crotty.\n\nHowever, after Carney spoke to the Mayor of Clarksville, he was allowed to work for the remainder\n\nof the season.\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Carney complained about Dutch Crotty a second time after Carney heard Dutch refer to a\n\nCaucasian female employee as a “nigger lover.” James Crotty suspended both Carney and Dutch\n\nCrotty after this incident. Carney was not rehired as a seasonal employee the next year, but he was\n\nlater re-hired as a regular, full-time employee.\n\n       Nicholson claims that, in 2007, he heard James Crotty refer to an African-American\n\nemployee as “blue.” Nicholson testified that he believed Crotty’s use of the word “blue” was\n\noffensive and derogatory, because it referenced the employee’s skin color: “It was the color of his\n\nskin. He was real dark.” (Nicholson Dep. 109, Page ID # 549.) Clarksville employee Kevin\n\nCowling also testified that he believed “blue” was a racial slur when Crotty used the term. (R. 40-2,\n\nExs. to Nicholson’s Resp. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Cowling Dep. 92, Page ID # 525.)\n\n       James and Dutch Crotty were both terminated in November 2008 after an incident involving\n\nmoney received from the sale of scrap metal. Nicholson testified that he was aware of the incidents\n\nbetween Dutch Crotty and Carney, and believed that Carney was fired in connection with those\n\nincidents. Carney also testified that Dutch Crotty was the only employee he ever heard using racial\n\nslurs, and that he was satisfied with the way Clarksville handled the “situation” with Dutch Crotty.\n\n(Carney Dep. 18, 32, Page ID # 314, 318.)\n\nE. Song Lyrics Incident\n\n       At his deposition, Nicholson recalled an incident where he was riding with a Caucasian\n\nemployee, who was Garry Harp’s nephew, “[a]nd he was listening to a song, and he kept on -- and\n\nthe song had the N-word, and he kept on saying the N-word.” (Nicholson Dep. 147, Page ID. # 252.)\n\nNicholson asked the employee to stop using the “N-word,” and the employee stopped using the word\n\n                                                   6\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\naround Nicholson. (Id.) While the employee never used the word around Nicholson again,\n\nNicholson claims that he “heard he did it again.” (Nicholson Dep. 147-48, Page ID # 251-52.)\n\nF. Segregated Work Crew\n\n        Nicholson testified that, in 2008, he believed that a work crew at Heritage Park was\n\nsegregated by race by assigning the Caucasian employees to work on the soccer fields, on one side\n\nof the park, and assigning the African-American employees to work on the baseball fields, on the\n\nother side of the park. In response to Clarksville’s Interrogatories, Nicholson claimed that he\n\ncomplained to Clarksville management about the segregated work crew, but that “nothing was ever\n\ndone.” (R. 31-2, Nicholson’s Resp. to Clarksville’s Interrogatories ¶ 8, Page ID # 300.) However,\n\nNicholson does not dispute that Maintenance Department Supervisor Garry Harp spoke with\n\nmaintenance workers regarding the alleged segregation, and that “[Nicholson] and other maintenance\n\nworkers told Harp that the workers chose their own work area based on what they wanted to do and\n\nwho they wanted to work with, and that work assignments were not assigned based on race.” (R.\n\n31-8, Exs. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Harp Decl. ¶ 11, Page ID # 411; Resp. to Clarksville’s\n\nSUMF ¶ 44, Page ID # 483.)\n\n        Clarksville employee Lorenzo Wells testified that he worked on the baseball field because\n\n“[he] knew more about softball. [H]e really didn’t know too much about soccer at all.” (R. 31-9,\n\nExs. to Clarksville’s Mot. Summ. J., Wells Dep. 21, Page ID # 415.) Wells also stated that he has\n\nasked Caucasian employees to help him with work on the baseball fields, and he has been asked to\n\nhelp on the soccer fields. Mose Garrett likewise testified that he has worked on both the soccer\n\nfields and baseball fields in the past.\n\n                                                7\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nG. 2008 Incidents\n\n       James Crotty changed Nicholson’s work assignment to the “trash truck” in 2008. Nicholson\n\ntestified that “at that time, I was going through my divorce, and [Crotty] knew, as far as I was trying\n\nto get my kids as much as I could. And out there at Heritage, you work a lot of weekends. So he\n\nwas, basically, trying to break me down.” (Nicholson Dep. 142, Page ID # 249.) Nicholson claimed\n\nthat he was required to log his hours and stay for a full eight-hour day while working on the trash\n\ntruck, while other employees were not required to log their hours, and would get paid for eight hours\n\nafter only working for four. James Crotty advised Nicholson that he would watch videos to make\n\nsure that Nicholson worked the full eight hours while assigned to the trash truck. Nicholson worked\n\non the trash truck for “a couple weeks” before he was taken off that assignment. (Nicholson Dep.\n\n142, Page ID # 249.)\n\n       Also in 2008, Nicholson witnessed Charlie Moody, a Caucasian employee, “physically kick\n\nan African American employee, Mose Garrett, in the butt.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶ 28, Page\n\nID # 481.) A Caucasian supervisor witnessed the incident and laughed, but took no disciplinary\n\naction. Nicholson later heard Moody say that he “was just playing with” Garrett (Nicholson Dep.\n\n136, Page ID # 236), and Garrett testified that Moody apologized for the incident three or four times,\n\nthat his apology was sincere, and that the incident never happened again.\n\nH. Noose Incidents\n\n       In November 2008, a maintenance crew found a noose hanging from a tree in a Clarksville\n\npark. Clarksville employee Marlon Matthews also found a noose in his work truck earlier that year.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nNicholson believed that a third noose was also found, but could not recall any details at his\n\ndeposition.\n\n        Derrick Oliver, an African-American park ranger with the Clarksville Parks and Recreation\n\nDepartment, conducted an investigation to determine who was responsible for hanging the nooses.\n\nA second investigation was also conducted by Bronson Gibbs, Clarksville’s Risk Manager. In\n\naddition, Clarksville’s request that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations perform its own\n\ninvestigation was granted. Nicholson stated that he was never interviewed as part of any of the\n\ninvestigations, but also conceded that he did not have any direct knowledge of who was responsible\n\nfor hanging the nooses. None of the investigations were able to identify the individual(s) responsible\n\nfor hanging the nooses.\n\n        In response to the noose incidents, Clarksville also initiated a city-wide sensitivity training\n\nprogram titled “Diversity and You.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶ 38, Page ID # 482.) Nicholson\n\nattended this training on February 10, 2009. Marlon Matthews testified that the Diversity and You\n\ntraining caused him to “curb[ his] language a whole lot after that.” (Matthews Dep. 35, Page ID #\n\n336.)\n\nI. Orville Sykes Incident\n\n        In January 2009, a Caucasian supervisor named Orville Sykes “cussed” Nicholson while\n\nNicholson was cutting down a tree with a chainsaw. Sykes told Nicholson, “boy you don’t know\n\nwhat you doing [sic],” and told Nicholson to “get [his] ass out of here.” (Nicholson’s Resp. to\n\nClarksville’s Interrogatory Request ¶ 13, Page ID # 304; Nicholson Dep. 65, Page ID # 217.) After\n\nSykes gave Nicholson “a verbal resume[,]” Nicholson turned off his chainsaw and handed it to\n\n                                                  9\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nSykes. (Nicholson Dep. 65-66, Page ID # 216-17.) Nicholson testified: “Orville Sykes was telling\n\nme about, hey, I’ve been chopping down trees for this long, that long. . . . So I figured he got more\n\nexperience, so I cut [the chainsaw] off; handed it to him.” (Id.) When Sykes began asking for\n\nNicholson’s name, Nicholson refused to answer because Sykes did not address him directly. The\n\nManager of Operations and Planning for the Parks and Recreation Department, Kevin Cowling,\n\nissued Nicholson a verbal reprimand for refusing to tell Sykes his name. However, Nicholson\n\ntestified that Cowling “said he would take care of [the reprimand], and I never knew -- I never heard\n\nanything else about that.” (Nicholson Dep. 66, Page ID # 216.)\n\nJ. Denial of Promotions\n\n       In May and October of 2009, Nicholson applied for two separate promotions to a\n\nMaintenance Worker II position. Nicholson could not recall at his deposition whether he was\n\ninterviewed for the Maintenance Worker II positions in 2009, but he did recall that he was previously\n\ninterviewed for a Maintenance Worker II position. (Nicholson Dep. 47, Page ID # 543.) Clarksville\n\ncontends that Nicholson was interviewed for the May 2009 position. Nicholson did not receive\n\neither promotion.\n\n       Maintenance Department Supervisor Garry Harp stated that Nicholson was not selected for\n\neither Maintenance Worker II position because he “did not possess all the skills necessary for the\n\nMaintenance II position, such as welding and plumbing.” (Harp Decl. ¶ 6, Page ID # 410.) Harp\n\nfurther attested to two opportunities that he had given Nicholson to demonstrate his welding and\n\nplumbing skills:\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n               One time, I allowed Mr. Nicholson to weld a broken gate [at] the fair\n               grounds. Mr. Nicholson did not repair it correctly the first time, and\n               I gave him a second chance to do it. In total, Mr. Nicholson took two\n               days to weld the gate, requiring me to give him overtime pay, and the\n               gate was still not properly repaired when he finished. Then, I asked\n               Marlon Matthews, a Maintenance II employee, to repair it and he\n               fixed it correctly in a very short period of time.\n\n                       Another time, Mr. Nicholson attempted to repair a faucet to\n               demonstrate his basic plumbing skills, which are also required of a\n               Maintenance II worker. He took the fixture apart, but was unable to\n               repair or put it back together. He left the faucet open and\n               disassembled overnight before telling me the next day that he could\n               not fix it.\n\n(Harp Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, Page ID # 410.)\n\n       Nicholson admitted that the gate broke the first time he tried to fix it. However, Nicholson\n\navers that he told Harp that he could not fully repair the gate initially because he needed additional\n\nparts. Nicholson also admitted that Marlon Matthews put the gate up again later, but claims that it\n\nbroke again afterward. Nicholson believes that the gate was breaking because “somebody was . . .\n\njust hitting it or something.” (Nicholson Dep. 49, Page ID # 544.) Nicholson also stated that he was\n\ntold he did not get the two Maintenance Worker II promotions because he had high blood pressure\n\nand because his Commercial Drivers License was invalid.\n\n       Nicholson stated that he spoke to Garry Harp about a Maintenance Worker II position that\n\nhe applied for in 2010, and Harp told Nicholson that he did not receive the position because of a\n\nback injury Nicholson had sustained while working. Nicholson also spoke to Garry Harp about a\n\nsupervisor opening, and Harp told Nicholson not to apply for the position “because [he] wouldn’t\n\nget it.” (Nicholson’s Resp. to Clarksville’s Interrogatories ¶ 9, Page ID # 302.)\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n         Mose Garrett testified that he had previously applied for a Maintenance Worker II position,\n\nbut a Caucasian employee named Tommy Little, who only had experience in swimming pool\n\nmaintenance, received the promotion instead. However, it is undisputed that other African-American\n\nemployees were promoted. Marlon Matthews was promoted from a Maintenance Worker I to a\n\nMaintenance Worker II position.       In 2010, an African-American employee named William\n\nHumphrey was promoted from Maintenance Worker I to a supervisory position as Department Crew\n\nChief.\n\n         In September 2010, Nicholson received a performance evaluation from his supervisor,\n\nRichard Davis, rating his performance as “meets expectations.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶¶\n\n111-12, Page ID # 494.) Davis changed his rating of Nicholson to “unsatisfactory” after Cowling\n\ntold Davis that the evaluation should reflect Nicholson’s performance throughout the entire year.\n\nCowling testified that he did not believe Davis’s initial evaluation of Nicholson as “meets\n\nexpectations” was accurate, because “Mr. Davis had expressed to [Cowling], on several occasions\n\nthroughout the year, that, you know, he had problems with [Nicholson] not wanting to do some\n\nthings, or not communicating, or asking why other people couldn’t do that if he didn’t want to do\n\nsomething.” (Cowling Dep. 108-09, Page ID # 406-07.) Nicholson was terminated in 2011.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n         This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Allen v.

Nicholson\n\ncontends that the discrete incidents of harassment he has alleged, when considered under the totality\n\nof the circumstances, were sufficient to alter the terms and conditions of his employment with\n\nClarksville. Nicholson also argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nClarksville’s claimed reasons for denying him promotions were pretextual, and that Clarksville\n\nengaged in retaliatory conduct in response to Nicholson’s formal and informal complaints about\n\nracial discrimination in the workplace.\n\nA. Hostile Work Environment\n\n       Nicholson’s hostile work environment claims under § 1981 and Title VII are subject to the\n\nsame standards. Jackson v. Quanex Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766145\"><a href=\"/opinion/766145/linda-jackson-v-quanex-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 (6th Cir. 1999).

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In evaluating a hostile work environment claim, the Court looks to the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, “considering even those claims that were not directed at a particular plaintiff and\n\nthose claims that a particular plaintiff did not witness.” Berryman v.

In Jackson, the plaintiff, an African-American woman, produced evidence\n\nshowing, inter alia, frequent use of racial slurs by co-workers and supervisors, racist graffiti in rest\n\nrooms depicting lynchings and the phrase “KKK is back,” the phrase “Blacks out back” on a door\n\n                                                  14\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nat the employer’s plant for at least two years, defacement of an African-American employee’s work\n\nshirt by writing the words “N----- Sucker” over his name, and different treatment for Caucasian and\n\nAfrican-American employees in terms of on-the-job training and opportunities for advancement.\n\nJackson, 191 F.3d at 651-54. The Jackson plaintiff was also called a “n----- bitch” and physically\n\nassaulted by a Caucasian co-worker. Id. at 655. After the plaintiff took a leave of absence due to\n\nthe assault, the employee who had assaulted her came to work wearing a hard hat with a swastika\n\non it. Id. Throughout the plaintiff’s employment, her employer demonstrated “a pattern of\n\nunresponsiveness . . . to the complaints of its African-American employees[.]” Id. at 665. This\n\nCourt found that, in considering the totality of the circumstances, including instances of racial\n\nharassment that were not directed specifically at the plaintiff, the trial court erred when it granted\n\njudgement as a matter of law in favor of the employer. Id. at 668.\n\n       Clarksville argues that Nicholson’s evidence only shows isolated incidents of general\n\nprofanity, and the few incidents involving racial slurs are insufficient to create a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. Clarksville asserts that sporadic and isolated comments by employees cannot\n\namount to “extreme” conduct that changes the terms and conditions of employment. Clarksville\n\nfurther argues that Nicholson’s hostile work environment claim fails because he cannot show that\n\nClarksville had knowledge of the alleged racial harassment and failed to act.\n\n       The district court properly determined that Nicholson had failed to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact on his hostile work environment claim. Most of the incidents relied on by Nicholson\n\nonly involved coarse language used by Clarksville employees, and did not evidence racial animus.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Nicholson admits that the 2005 incident, where an assistant manager told a group of\n\nemployees that their “asses were fired” if they did not complete their work, involved coarse language\n\ndirected at both African-American and Caucasian employees. This incident, which involved no\n\nracial slurs, cannot be construed as evidencing a racially hostile work environment.\n\n       As to 2007, Nicholson cannot recall what language John Walk used when he “cussed”\n\nMarlon Matthews. Absent any indication of racial hostility, this incident does not support\n\nNicholson’s claim of a racially hostile work environment.\n\n       Nicholson claims that his 2007 written reprimand by his supervisor, James Clark, evidences\n\nracial animus, because Clark did not also reprimand Tim Bishop, Nicholson’s Caucasian co-worker,\n\nwho also arrived late after lunch. However, the reprimand submitted into evidence reflects that\n\nNicholson was reprimanded for arguing with his supervisor, not for arriving late after lunch.\n\nNicholson does not claim that Bishop also argued with Clark and was not reprimanded.\n\nFurthermore, Nicholson admits that Clark later apologized for the reprimand and the issue was\n\nresolved to Nicholson’s satisfaction.\n\n       Similarly, there is no indication that the 2008 kicking incident involving Mose Garrett and\n\nCharlie Moody was motivated by racial animus, and Garrett testified that Moody sincerely\n\napologized after the incident.\n\n       Although Nicholson initially complained about the alleged segregation of a work crew in\n\n2008, he admits that he later told the Maintenance Department Supervisor that the work crew\n\nactually chose their own work assignments, and employees were not assigned to the baseball or\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nsoccer fields based on their race. Further, there was testimony that each crew also worked on the\n\nother crew’s field – baseball and soccer.\n\n        The evidence reflects four instances of racial slurs between the years 2007 and 2009. Only\n\none of these incidents involved language specifically directed at Nicholson – the 2009 incident in\n\nwhich Orville Sykes referred to Nicholson as “boy.” Nicholson was aware of two racial slurs in\n\n2007 – Dutch Crotty referring to a female employee as a “nigger lover,” and James Crotty referring\n\nto an African-American employee as “blue.” Both Crottys were subsequently terminated by\n\nClarksville. Nicholson also recalls an incident where he rode in a truck with a Caucasian employee\n\nand heard him singing along with a song that used the “N-word.” When Nicholson asked him to stop\n\nsinging along around Nicholson, the employee complied.\n\n        These four isolated instances over the course of two years, while inappropriate and offensive,\n\nare not so severe and pervasive as to alter the terms and conditions of Nicholson’s employment. See\n\nFarragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (noting that “isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not\n\namount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’”); see also\n\nArmstrong v. Whirlpool Corp., 363 F. App’x 317, 327 (6th Cir. 2010) (affirming district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment on hostile work environment claim involving “a handful of uses of the\n\nn-word and its derivatives, . . . some racist jokes . . ., a few references . . . to the Ku Klux Klan and\n\nJames Earl Ray, and the presence of racist graffiti that was removed as soon as [the plaintiff]\n\nreported it to a supervisor.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n        Nicholson argues that the totality of circumstances should include Clarksville’s failure to\n\npromote Nicholson, unwarranted disciplinary actions, and alleged retaliation. Even considering\n\n                                                   17\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nthese facts, however, Nicholson still fails to establish a hostile work environment claim. As\n\ndiscussed infra, there is no evidence that Clarksville denied Nicholson’s requests for promotion to\n\nthe Maintenance Worker II position because of Nicholson’s race. Likewise, there is no evidence that\n\nany disciplinary actions taken by Clarksville were unwarranted, or that Nicholson was disciplined\n\nmore harshly based on his race. Furthermore, if the 2008 noose incidents are considered as part of\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, they are insufficient to support a hostile work environment claim\n\nbecause there is no evidence that Clarksville employees hung the nooses. Indeed, the undisputed\n\nevidence shows that the nooses were immediately removed after they were discovered, that\n\nClarksville initiated two separate investigations seeking to identify the individual or individuals who\n\nhung the nooses, and also requested a third investigation from the Tennessee Bureau of\n\nInvestigations.   Further, the evidence establishes that in response to these noose incidents,\n\nClarksville held a diversity sensitivity training program for its employees.\n\n       Nicholson testified that he was aware that Donald Carney was suspended after he complained\n\nabout Dutch Crotty’s use of racial slurs, and that Carney was not rehired by Clarksville as a seasonal\n\nemployee the year after. However, Carney was later hired as a full-time, permanent employee at\n\nClarksville. As noted supra, both Dutch Crotty and his brother, James Crotty, were terminated by\n\nClarksville. Viewed as a whole, these facts do not imply a severe and pervasive hostility towards\n\nAfrican-American employees.\n\n       Viewing the totality of the circumstances, Nicholson has failed to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to whether the discriminatory conduct alleged was so severe and pervasive that\n\nit altered the terms and conditions of Nicholson’s employment. The district court therefore did not\n\n                                                  18\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v.

Failure to Promote\n\n          To establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination on a failure to promote claim,\n\nNicholson must establish that: “(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he applied and was\n\nqualified for a promotion; (3) he was considered for and denied the promotion; and (4) other\n\nemployees of similar qualifications who were not members of the protected class received\n\npromotions.” Dews v.

Clarksville’s assertion that Nicholson cannot\n\nestablish a prima facie case is unsupported by any law or analysis, and is therefore waived. “Issues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are\n\ndeemed waived. It is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal\n\nway, leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.” McPherson v. Kelsey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746760\"><a href=\"/opinion/746760/douglas-c-mcpherson-and-connie-k-mcpherson/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995-96 (6th\n\nCir. 1997) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        The argument in both Nicholson’s and Clarksville’s briefs focuses on whether Nicholson has\n\nproduced evidence showing that Clarksville’s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is\n\npretextual. “A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the proffered reason (1) has no\n\nbasis in fact, (2) did not actually motivate the defendant’s challenged conduct, or (3) was insufficient\n\nto warrant the challenged conduct.” Dews, 231 F.3d at 1021. Nicholson bears “the ultimate burden\n\nof producing sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably reject [Clarksville’s]\n\nexplanation and infer that [Clarksville] intentionally discriminated against him.” Johnson v. Kroger\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780868\"><a href=\"/opinion/780868/stanley-johnson-v-the-kroger-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 866 (6th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Clarksville asserts that Nicholson was not promoted to a Maintenance Worker II position\n\nbecause he failed to demonstrate the required welding and plumbing skills, and because he was\n\nargumentative and resisted directives from his superiors. Nicholson attempts to show that this\n\nreason is a mere pretext for discrimination by relying on several different facts.\n\n        Nicholson first contends that he made complaints to his supervisors regarding racial\n\ndiscrimination, and subsequently applied for promotions “but was not even interviewed each time.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. at 30.) However, Nicholson admitted at his deposition that he had been interviewed\n\n                                                  20\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\nfor a Maintenance Worker II position. (Nicholson Dep. 47, Page ID # 543.) Nicholson also does\n\nnot dispute that a gate he was asked to fix collapsed after he tack welded it on two different\n\noccasions, and that it was ultimately fixed correctly by Marlon Matthews “in a very short period of\n\ntime.” (Resp. to Clarksville’s SUMF ¶¶ 74-75.) While Nicholson stated that he believes that\n\n“somebody was . . . just hitting [the gate]” (Nicholson Dep. 49, Page ID # 544), Nicholson’s\n\nsubjective belief as to why the gate collapsed does not establish that Clarksville’s reasons for\n\ndenying Nicholson a promotion were a mere pretext in light of the undisputed facts in the record.\n\n       Nicholson also notes that Garry Harp told him not to apply for a promotion because he would\n\nnot get it, but Nicholson does not show that Harp’s comment was based on racial animus. This fact,\n\nstanding alone, does not evidence that Clarksville’s proffered reasons for denying Nicholson’s\n\npromotions are a pretext.\n\n       Nicholson next appears to argue that one of the Caucasian employees who received a\n\npromotion to the Maintenance Worker II position was less qualified than Nicholson because he did\n\nnot have a Commercial Drivers License (“CDL”), which was a requirement for the position.\n\nHowever, Clarksville’s promotion of Marlon Matthews to a Maintenance Worker II position\n\nundermines this argument. Matthews, who is African American, was allowed to obtain a CDL after\n\nhe was promoted. As stated by the district court, “to the extent that the defendant failed to\n\nconsistently apply its requirement mandating possession of a commercial driver’s license, it did so\n\nin such a way that both white and African American employees benefitted.” (Sept. 12, 2012\n\nMemorandum Op. 21, Page ID # 623.)\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fNo. 12-6318\nNicholson v. City of Clarksville\n\n       Nicholson argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to pretext based on the action\n\nof his supervisor, Richard Davis, changing his employee evaluation in 2010 from “meets\n\nexpectations” to “unsatisfactory.” Nicholson admits, though, that Kevin Cowling did not think the\n\ninitial evaluation was accurate, and asked Davis to change Nicholson’s evaluation to reflect his\n\nperformance throughout the year. Nicholson does not produce any evidence tending to show that\n\nCowling’s request was based on racial animus.\n\n       Nicholson has failed to produce sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact as to whether\n\nClarksville’s proffered reasons for denying his promotion to the Maintenance Worker II position\n\nwere pretextual. The district court’s grant of summary judgment on Nicholson’s failure to promote\n\nclaim is therefore affirmed.\n\nC. Retaliation\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Nicholson must demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that (1) he engaged in a protected activity under Title VII, (2)\n\nNicholson’s protected activity was known to Clarksville, (3) Clarksville took adverse employment\n\nactions against Nicholson, and (4) there was a causal connection between the adverse employment\n\naction and the protected activity.

City of Clarksville\n\nreason, then the burden of production returns to the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that the proffered reason was a mere pretext for discrimination.” Id. at 675.\n\nFurthermore, the United States Supreme Court recently clarified that a Title VII plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate “but for” causation to sustain a retaliation claim.\n\n               Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional\n               principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated\n               in § 2000e-2(m). This requires proof that the unlawful retaliation\n               would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action\n               or actions of the employer.\n\nUniv. of Tex.

However, Nicholson has not produced any evidence of further complaints he made about racial\n\ndiscrimination after he complained about the segregated work crew in Heritage Park. The district\n\ncourt nevertheless noted that “the record evidence shows that the plaintiff filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) on March 27,\n\n2009.” (Sept. 12, 2012 Memorandum Op. 25, Page ID # 627.) Therefore, Nicholson’s complaint\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         We need not address whether the Nassar holding regarding Title VII retaliation applies\nas well to Nicholson’s § 1981 retaliation claim because Nicholson cannot satisfy even the\ncausation requirement for Title VII retaliation claims under the pre-Nassar law that our Circuit\nhas applied to § 1981 claims.

But a prima\n\nfacie case based on temporal proximity alone requires a short period of time between the protected\n\nactivity and the adverse employment action, “usually less than six months.” Nguyen v.

As this Court\n\nnoted in Mickey, supra:\n\n                Where an adverse employment action occurs very close in time after\n                an employer learns of a protected activity, such temporal proximity\n                between the events is significant enough to constitute evidence of a\n                causal connection for the purposes of satisfying a prima facie case of\n                retaliation. But where some time elapses between when the employer\n                learns of a protected activity and the subsequent adverse employment\n                action, the employee must couple temporal proximity with other\n                evidence of retaliatory conduct to establish causality.\n\n516 F.3d at 525.

City of Clarksville\n\n          Regarding Nicholson’s complaint about the segregated work crew, he states only that he\n\nmade the complaint sometime in 2008 and has not produced evidence approximating a more specific\n\ndate. Because Nicholson relies on temporal proximity to establish the causal connection element of\n\nhis prima facie case of retaliation, he bears the burden of establishing temporal proximity by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Taylor, 703 F.3d at 336. Nicholson has failed to produce evidence\n\neven approximating when he made his complaint in 2008, and therefore cannot establish a prima\n\nfacie case of retaliation with respect to his 2008 complaint.\n\n          The only other protected activity evidenced in the record is Nicholson’s March 27, 2009\n\nEEOC charge. After he filed this charge, Nicholson asserts that Clarksville engaged in adverse\n\nemployment activities by declining to promote him in May and October of 2009, by changing his\n\nperformance evaluation in September 2010, and by subjecting him to unwarranted disciplinary\n\naction.\n\n          The October 2009 denial of promotion occurred more than six months after Nicholson\n\nengaged in protected activity, and the changes to Nicholson’s performance evaluation in September\n\n2010 occurred 18 months after the protected activity. A time period greater than six months, without\n\nmore, is not a sufficiently short period of time to satisfy the causal connection element of a\n\nretaliation claim.
