In this case the trial court granted a summary\r\njudgment in favor of the manufacturer on the products liability issue,\r\nand ordered the manufacturer to pay the retailer's costs, expenses, and\r\nattorney's fees incurred in defending the products liability case.  The\r\nmanufacturer appeals from the order to pay costs, expenses, and\r\nattorney's fees.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDu Pont manufactured a herbicide that it marketed under the\r\nbrand name \"Accent.\"  Ernest Boemer bought Accent from Bee\r\nAgricultural Company (Bee Ag) and applied it to his crops.  Boemer\r\nalleged that Accent damaged his crops, and sued Du Pont and Bee Ag\r\n(\"the Accent case\"), asserting causes of action for breach of warranty,\r\ncommon law strict liability, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and\r\nviolations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.  Although these causes\r\nof action were alleged against the defendants generally, the only facts\r\npleaded by Boemer supporting his fraud, negligent misrepresentation,\r\nand DTPA causes of action concerned the actions of Du Pont.  Boemer\r\ndid not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Bee Ag independent of Du\r\nPont in the Accent case.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBee Ag and Judy Schauer, the widow and heir of Fred Schauer,<sup>(1)</sup>\r\nthen filed a separate case against Boemer to collect debts allegedly\r\nowed to them by Boemer (\"the collection case\").  Boemer\r\ncounterclaimed in the collection case, reasserting his Accent related\r\nclaims, and also stating a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  Boemer's\r\nclaim for breach of fiduciary duty concerned allegations that Fred\r\nSchauer had promised to provide credit to Boemer and induced Boemer\r\ninto a dependent relationship on Schauer, which Schauer then exploited\r\nfor his own personal gain and to the detriment of Boemer.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBee Ag then filed additional pleadings seeking indemnity from Du\r\nPont under section 82.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode.  Bee Ag entered into a settlement agreement with Boemer,\r\naccepting a promissory note and 45% of the net proceeds from\r\nBoemer's claim against Du Pont in satisfaction of its collection claims\r\nagainst Boemer.  Boemer stipulated that his sole remaining cause of\r\naction against Bee Ag after the settlement agreement was a DTPA\r\nunconscionability claim.  The trial court then granted a summary\r\njudgment motion brought by Du Pont and entered a take-nothing\r\njudgment in the Accent case.  A bench trial was held on the issue of\r\nBee Ag's indemnification claim, and the trial court ordered Du Pont to\r\npay $61,442.38 to Bee Ag.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOn appeal, Du Pont advances several arguments against the\r\naward to Bee Ag.  First, Du Pont argues that, because Boemer asserted\r\nfraud, negligent misrepresentation, and a DTPA claim against Bee Ag,\r\nBee Ag does not qualify for indemnity under section 82.002.  Du Pont\r\nargues that it should not be responsible for costs incurred in the\r\ncollection case, and that Bee Ag failed to segregate its attorney's fees\r\nbetween the Accent case and the collection case.  Du Pont also\r\ncontends that the settlement between Bee Ag and Du Pont left Bee Ag\r\nwith a conflict of interest in the Accent litigation, and that\r\nindemnification should not be available under these kinds of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSection 82.002(a) provides:\r\n\r\n</p><p>A manufacturer shall indemnify and hold harmless a seller\r\nagainst loss arising out of a products liability action, except\r\nfor any loss caused by the seller's negligence, intentional\r\nmisconduct, or other act or omission, such as negligently\r\nmodifying or altering the product, for which the seller is\r\nindependently liable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 82.002(a) (Vernon 1997).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDu Pont argues that, because Boemer advanced fraud, negligent\r\nmisrepresentation, and DTPA claims against Bee Ag, Bee Ag's\r\nattorney's fees are at least partially attributable to the allegations that\r\nBee Ag had engaged in negligence or intentional misconduct.  Bee Ag\r\ncontends that mere allegations of wrongdoing are not sufficient to\r\nremove an innocent retailer from the indemnification offered by section\r\n82.002.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tTexas appellate courts have reached somewhat contradictory\r\nconclusions on this issue.  In <em>Hurst v. American Racing Equip</em>., 981\r\nS.W.2d 458 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1998, no pet.) the plaintiff had been\r\ninjured when lug bolts broke off of his van.  He sued the manufacturer,\r\ndistributor, and retailer of the wheels on products liability grounds, and\r\nalso asserted a cause of action against the retailer for negligent\r\ninspection and installation of the wheels.  <em>Id</em>. at 460.  The court of\r\nappeals held that the retailer was not entitled to indemnification for\r\nattorney's fees from the manufacturer because it was required to\r\ndefend against the negligence action, and could not argue that all of its\r\nattorney's fees were incurred in defense of the products liability claim. \r\n<em>Id</em>. at 463.<em>  </em>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn <em>Freightliner Corp. v. Ruan Leasing Co</em>., 6 S.W.3d 726 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1999, pet. granted) a truck driver was injured while trying\r\nto open the hood of a truck when the hood-handle broke.  In addition to\r\nproducts liability claims against the owner of the truck and the\r\nmanufacturers of the truck and the hood, allegations also arose that the\r\nowner had been negligent in its maintenance of the hood.<em>  </em>The Austin\r\ncourt declined to follow <em>Hurst</em> and held that a mere allegation of\r\nnegligence, without a finding of actual liability, is not sufficient to defeat\r\nthe claim for indemnity.  <em>Id</em>. at 731-32.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHowever, we need not choose a side in the split between the\r\nTexarkana Court's <em>Hurst</em> opinion and the Austin Court's <em>Freightliner</em>\r\nopinion.  Although Boemer's fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and\r\nDTPA claims were asserted generally, the only facts pleaded to support\r\nthose claims concerned the action of Du Pont only.  There is no\r\nreference to any negligence or intentional misconduct on the part of Bee\r\nAg that would make it \"independently liable.\"  Rather, it is apparent that\r\nBoemer's only allegations against Bee Ag in the Accent case concern\r\nBee Ag's potential liability for selling the product manufactured by Du\r\nPont.  Furthermore, for the one claim that did allege independent\r\nliability against Bee Ag, the breach of fiduciary duty claim asserted in\r\nthe collection case, Bee Ag <em>did</em> segregate its attorney fees, unlike in\r\n<em>Hurst </em>or <em>Freightliner</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBee Ag retained separate counsel for the Accent case and the\r\ncollection case.  Bee Ag sought indemnification for only the fees\r\nincurred by Meredith, Donnell, &amp; Abernathy, the law firm it employed\r\nfor the Accent case.  Du Pont argues that some of the items listed in the\r\nbilling records for Meredith, Donnell, &amp; Abernathy pertained to the\r\ncollection case.  The billing records do contain occasional references to\r\nbrief consultations with Ward Thomas, Bee Ag's lawyer for the\r\ncollection case, and reviewing letters and documents from that case. \r\nThese activities constitute a tiny minority of the time billed.  In order for\r\nMeredith, Donnell, &amp; Abernathy to provide appropriate legal services to\r\nBee Ag in the Accent case, it was necessary that the law firm maintain\r\nat least a cursory familiarity with the progress of the collection case\r\ninvolving the same parties.  Eventually the two cases were\r\nconsolidated, further emphasizing the appropriateness of a lawyer\r\nworking on the Accent case remaining informed about events in the\r\ncollection case.  We find nothing improper in permitting Bee Ag to\r\nobtain indemnification for the occasional references to the collection\r\ncase in the law firm's billing records.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDu Pont also complains that the conduct of Bee Ag in accepting\r\na percentage of Boemer's possible recovery against Du Pont in\r\nsettlement of its claims against him presented Bee Ag with a conflict of\r\ninterest, and this conflict should prevent Bee Ag from receiving\r\nindemnification.  Du Pont argues that permitting Bee Ag to recover is\r\n\"contrary to the public policies identified in <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co.\r\nv. Gandy</em>, 925 S.W.2d 696 (Tex. 1996),\" and violates its Due Process\r\nrights.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn <em>Gandy</em>, the Texas Supreme Court held that a settlement\r\nagreement violated public policy and was void where the plaintiff and\r\ndefendant agreed on liability of $6 million, but the plaintiff agreed not\r\nto seek collection from the defendant, instead accepting assignment of\r\nthe defendant's rights to collect the $6 million from the defendant's\r\ninsurer.  The Texas Supreme Court noted that the right to assign a\r\ncause of action arises from the common law, not statutory law, and has\r\nits roots in equity, not law.  <em>Id</em>. at 705-07.  As arbiter of Texas common\r\nlaw, the Texas Supreme Court refused to permit the assignment\r\narranged by the parties in <em>Gandy</em>.  <em>Id.</em> at 719.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHowever, the issue in the instant case is not whether Bee Ag\r\nshould be permitted to act as the assignee of Boemer's claims against\r\nDu Pont, but whether Bee Ag is entitled to statutory indemnity under\r\nsection 82.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. \r\nTherefore, <em>Gandy</em> and its discussion of the common law and public\r\npolicy are inapposite.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDu Pont makes no argument in support of its \"Due Process\" point. \r\nIt does cite two cases, but does not explain how either supports its\r\nappeal.  In the first case, <em>Kalteyer v. Sullivan</em>, 46 S.W. 288 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp--San Antonio 1898, writ ref'd), the court invalidated an order of the\r\ncity of San Antonio granting Sullivan the right to close an alley.  The\r\ncourt held that owners of property along the alley such as Kalteyer had\r\nproperty interests in the alley which the city council could not take\r\naway.  <em>Id</em>. at 290-91.  In <em>Stevens v. City of Dublin</em>, 169 S.W. 188 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Fort Worth 1914, no writ), the court held that a municipality\r\nhad exceeded its police powers in permanently closing a street that\r\npassed next to a school.  Although neither opinion mentions the term\r\n\"Due Process\" nor invokes the Constitution, both cases do refer to\r\nproperty rights of the plaintiffs and the government's lack of authority\r\nto remove those property rights, which seems referable to\r\nConstitutional Due Process protections.  Nevertheless, we fail to see,\r\nand appellant has not troubled itself to explain, how the property rights\r\nasserted in those cases are relevant to the instant case.  We conclude\r\nthat Du Pont has failed to demonstrate any violation of its Due Process\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHaving overruled all of the arguments asserted by the appellant,\r\nwe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMELCHOR CHAVEZ\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Publish.\r\n\r\n</p><p>TEX.

We find nothing improper in permitting Bee Ag to\r\nobtain indemnification for the occasional references to the collection\r\ncase in the law firm's billing records.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDu Pont also complains that the conduct of Bee Ag in accepting\r\na percentage of Boemer's possible recovery against Du Pont in\r\nsettlement of its claims against him presented Bee Ag with a conflict of\r\ninterest, and this conflict should prevent Bee Ag from receiving\r\nindemnification.  Du Pont argues that permitting Bee Ag to recover is\r\n\"contrary to the public policies identified in <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co.\r\nv. Gandy</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768110/state-farm-fire-and-cas-co-v-gandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span> (Tex. 1996),\" and violates its Due Process\r\nrights.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn <em>Gandy</em>, the Texas Supreme Court held that a settlement\r\nagreement violated public policy and was void where the plaintiff and\r\ndefendant agreed on liability of $6 million, but the plaintiff agreed not\r\nto seek collection from the defendant, instead accepting assignment of\r\nthe defendant's rights to collect the $6 million from the defendant's\r\ninsurer.  The Texas Supreme Court noted that the right to assign a\r\ncause of action arises from the common law, not statutory law, and has\r\nits roots in equity, not law.  <em>Id</em>. at 705-07.  As arbiter of Texas common\r\nlaw, the Texas Supreme Court refused to permit the assignment\r\narranged by the parties in <em>Gandy</em>.  <em>Id.</em> at 719.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHowever, the issue in the instant case is not whether Bee Ag\r\nshould be permitted to act as the assignee of Boemer's claims against\r\nDu Pont, but whether Bee Ag is entitled to statutory indemnity under\r\nsection 82.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. \r\nTherefore, <em>Gandy</em> and its discussion of the common law and public\r\npolicy are inapposite.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDu Pont makes no argument in support of its \"Due Process\" point. \r\nIt does cite two cases, but does not explain how either supports its\r\nappeal.  In the first case, <em>Kalteyer v. Sullivan</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3968288\"><a href=\"/opinion/4197611/kalteyer-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span> (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp--San Antonio 1898, writ ref'd), the court invalidated an order of the\r\ncity of San Antonio granting Sullivan the right to close an alley.  The\r\ncourt held that owners of property along the alley such as Kalteyer had\r\nproperty interests in the alley which the city council could not take\r\naway.  <em>Id</em>. at 290-91.  In <em>Stevens v. City of Dublin</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3915216\"><a href=\"/opinion/4150678/stevens-v-city-of-dublin/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span> (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Fort Worth 1914, no writ), the court held that a municipality\r\nhad exceeded its police powers in permanently closing a street that\r\npassed next to a school.  Although neither opinion mentions the term\r\n\"Due Process\" nor invokes the Constitution, both cases do refer to\r\nproperty rights of the plaintiffs and the government's lack of authority\r\nto remove those property rights, which seems referable to\r\nConstitutional Due Process protections.  Nevertheless, we fail to see,\r\nand appellant has not troubled itself to explain, how the property rights\r\nasserted in those cases are relevant to the instant case.  We conclude\r\nthat Du Pont has failed to demonstrate any violation of its Due Process\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHaving overruled all of the arguments asserted by the appellant,\r\nwe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMELCHOR CHAVEZ\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Publish.\r\n\r\n</p><p>TEX.
