Treating a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants as a motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed the complaint.  Because the trial judge took this action without first notifying appellants of his intention to do so and without affording appellants the required opportunity to oppose the treatment of the motion as one for summary judgment, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 1976, appellants were involved in an altercation with several other inmates at the Iowa State Penitentiary.  Defendants James Menke (security director of the prison) and Ronald Knipe (assistant security director) interviewed a number of prisoners about the incident.  Following this investigation, appellants were charged on February 23 with serious rule violations, including assault, fighting and possession of a weapon.  On March 12, disciplinary hearings were conducted with Menke and Knipe participating as members of the hearing committee.  Upon being found guilty of the alleged violations, appellants were each sentenced to ten days in isolation, loss of recreational privileges and classification to indefinite administrative segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 1976, appellants each filed with the district court a pro se complaint alleging in substance that his constitutional rights had been violated because Menke and Knipe had acted as both investigators and members of the hearing committee.  Finding the factual allegations contained in these complaints to be vague and conclusory, the district court ordered the defendant prison officials to file a report regarding the circumstances surrounding the altercation.  Realizing that the disciplinary procedures which had been followed might raise serious questions of due process violations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the defendants conducted a second hearing on June 14, without the participation of Menke and Knipe as members of the committee.  Appellants were again found guilty and their sentences were reaffirmed.  Thereafter, on July 6, defendants filed their report, explaining the nature of the charges against appellants, their sentences and the reason for the second hearing.  Along with this report, defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), asserting that any constitutional infirmity in the first disciplinary hearing had been cured by the second.  A brief was filed in support of this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13 appellants filed two additional documents, one denominated a \"complaint,\" the other \"brief in support of plaintiffs.\" These documents, inter alia, expressed appellants' belief that the second hearing had been a sham and that appellants were not receiving meaningful review of their administrative segregation status.  Also on August 13, the district court filed his order dismissing appellants' complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with the proposition that the procedural requirements of Rule 56 are to be strictly adhered to.  Ailshire v. Darnell,508 F.2d 526, 528 (8th Cir. 1974).  That rule provides that a motion for summary judgment \"shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  The purpose of this notice provision is to allow the opposing party a meaningful opportunity to resist the motion by submitting counteraffidavits.  Therefore, the required notice cannot be dispensed with merely because a motion to dismiss is treated as a motion for summary judgment by the district court, and this is true even though more than 10 days have elapsed between the filing of the motion and the entry of the order of dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See Ailshire v. Darnell, supra, 508 F.2d at 527-28; Scott v.

We are particularly concerned in the context of this case, where two pro se complainants submitted from their jail cells typewritten statements of ambiguous import.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See, e. g., Curry v. Brown, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 231, 440 F.2d 259, 261-62 (1971); Hudson v.

The district court concluded that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the second disciplinary hearing cured any conceivable due process violations occurring in the first.  This view does not dispose of the claim that the second hearing itself fell short of affording due process guarantees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating the documents filed by appellants in response to defendants' motion to dismiss as amendments to the original complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the district court construed these documents as having properly raised the question of the impartiality of the second hearing committee.  In ordering dismissal, however, the court stated that \"(i)t cannot be concluded from the record that the second hearing was lacking the impartiality needed to satisfy due process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not now consider whether this finding was justified by the record before the district court.  We observe only that appellants were under no burden at this stage of the proceedings to prove the factual existence of bias.  It is enough to withstand a motion to dismiss that the plaintiff has made factual allegations which, accepted as true, state a basis for relief.  A motion to dismiss should be granted only when it \"appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\"  Conley v.
