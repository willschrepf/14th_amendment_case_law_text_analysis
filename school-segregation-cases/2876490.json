Picquin-George a/k/a John R. Daley, Jr. (“Daley”), proceeding\n\npro se and in forma pauperis, appeals an order of the United States District Court for the\n\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his complaint. Because this appeal is\n\nmeritless, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).\n\n       Daley, an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institute at Schuylkill, commenced\n\nthis Bivens action against the prison’s warden and health administration department\n\n(“Appellees”). Daley’s original complaint sets forth allegations that the prison\n\nimproperly denied his requests for more comprehensive HIV testing, that the prison\n\ndenied him sufficient access to the institution’s law libraries, that the law library located\n\nin the prison’s segregation unit maintains an inadequate collection of legal research\n\nmaterials, and that he was retaliated against for requesting employment at the law library.\n\n       The Magistrate Judge immediately screened the complaint as required by 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1915A, and concluded, in an order entered November 22, 2005, that Daley had\n\nfailed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. The order granted Daley leave to\n\namend the complaint, but because his subsequent filings did not meaningfully develop his\n\ninitial allegations, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation on January 9,\n\n2006, advising dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1). Daley timely filed\n\nobjections to the Magistrate Judge’s report on the grounds that he had never consented to\n\nreferral of his case to a magistrate, that the court did not have the authority to refer his\n\nsuit to a magistrate, and that, for various other reasons, the report erroneously concluded\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fthat Daley had failed to state a claim. In spite of these objections, the District Court\n\nadopted the report and recommendation in its entirety and dismissed the case in an order\n\nentered February 15, 2006. This appeal followed.1\n\n       As this Court has granted Daley leave to appeal in forma pauperis, his appeal is\n\nsubject to dismissal if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989). First, we must consider\n\nwhether Daley has stated a non-frivolous claim against Appellees for denying his request\n\nto undergo more comprehensive HIV testing. Daley has attached to his original\n\ncomplaint a copy of a memorandum he received from the warden, dated September 22,\n\n2005, acknowledging that Daley was given a blood test for the purpose of detecting HIV\n\nand stating that his request for semen and urine testing was being denied because “semen\n\nand urine are not routinely used in the diagnosis of HIV.” Daley alleges that Appellees’\n\nfailure to administer these additional tests amounts to a violation of his constitutional and\n\nstatutory rights. Specifically, Daley’s original complaint cites to 18 U.S.C. § 4014(a),\n\n\n       1\n        We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We consider Appellant’s\nnotice of appeal timely even though it was not filed until May 22, 2006, over three\nmonths after entry of the judgment being appealed. Subject to certain exceptions not\napplicable to this case, a litigant has 150 days to file an appeal of a judgment that is not\n“set forth on a separate document.” F ED. R. C IV. P. 58(a)(1), (b)(2)(B); F ED. R. A PP. P.\n4(a)(7)(A)(ii). The District Court did not comply with the separate-document rule\nbecause its order language was placed at the end of a seven-page document substantially\ndevoted to recitation of procedural history and legal analysis. See In re Cedant Corp.\nSecurities Litigation, 454 F.3d 235, 241 (3d Cir. 2006) (to qualify as a separate document,\nan order “must omit (or at least substantially omit) the District Court’s reasons for\ndisposing of the parties’ claims”).\n\n                                              3\n\fwhich mandates HIV testing of at-risk federal prisoners sentenced for a term of six\n\nmonths or more, and 18 U.S.C. § 4048(l), which requires the Federal Bureau of Prisons to\n\nprovide prisoners with medically appropriate HIV and AIDS treatment. Daley also\n\nalleges that denial of his request amounts to a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.\n\n       In evaluating these claims, the District Court properly took notice of an online\n\npublication issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that the\n\ndrawing of blood is the “standard screening test” used to determine the presence of HIV\n\nand that the accuracy of urine tests is “somewhat less than that of the blood . . . tests.”\n\nUnited States Dep’t of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and\n\nPrevention, What are the different HIV screening tests available in the U.S.?, at\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa8.htm (last visited Oct. 4, 2006). Thus, since a\n\nblood test had already been administered, prison medical personnel did not violate their\n\nstatutory testing duties by denying Daley’s request for urine and semen testing. It follows\n\nthat denial of Daley’s request does not evidence “deliberate indifference to serious\n\nmedical needs,” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976), in violation of the Cruel and\n\nUnusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. See Doe v. Wigginton, 21 F.3d\n\n733, 738-39 (6th Cir. 1994). Finally, we find no basis for Daley’s Fourteenth\n\nAmendment claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       We next address Daley’s allegations that the prison segregation unit’s law library\n\ndoes not contain adequate research materials and that he has been denied sufficient time\n\nto access the prison’s law libraries. Denial of access to a prison law library is actionable\n\nas a constitutional violation only insofar as the denial impedes a prisoner’s constitutional\n\nright of access to the courts. See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 350-51 (1996).\n\nAccordingly, a prisoner does not have standing to bring a denial of access suit if he\n\nmerely alleges that a prison law library is inaccessible or has a deficient collection of\n\nlegal research materials. See id. at 351. Rather, to gain standing, a prisoner must\n\ndemonstrate actual injury by alleging that the “shortcomings in the library or legal\n\nassistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.” Id.; see also Allah v.\n\nSeiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 224 n.5 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that prisoner has standing to\n\nbring right of access claim where complaint alleges that lack of access to prison library\n\nresulted in inability to file brief in post-conviction appeal). We agree with the District\n\nCourt that Daley’s right of access claims are without merit because he has failed to\n\ndescribe how the alleged inadequacies have impeded his ability to bring or prosecute a\n\nclaim. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 242 (3d Cir. 1999) (affirming\n\ndismissal of right of access claim because prisoner failed to describe how prison\n\nworkload prevented him from pursuing his appeal); Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.3d 166,\n\n182-83 (3d Cir. 1997) (affirming dismissal of right of access claim because plaintiffs\n\nfailed to allege actual injury derived from challenged prison policy). We also note that\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fwhile the original complaint cites various regulatory provisions that require federal prison\n\nwardens to ensure prisoners have access to certain minimal library services (i.e., 28\n\nC.F.R. §§ 543.11, 544.100, .101), Daley has failed to set forth comprehensible facts\n\nindicating that the warden has not met these requirements.\n\n         Finally, we note that the District Court properly dismissed Daley’s retaliation\n\nclaim because he has not alleged that he suffered adverse action as a result of exercising a\n\nconstitutional right. See Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir. 2003). Moreover,\n\nthe retaliation claim fails because he has not alleged that any defendant was personally\n\ninvolved in the wrongdoing. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the District Court that Daley has failed to\n\nstate a claim on which relief may be granted. We also agree that Daley’s objections to the\n\nDistrict Court’s adoption of the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation are\n\ngroundless. Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f",

Daley also\n\nalleges that denial of his request amounts to a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.\n\n       In evaluating these claims, the District Court properly took notice of an online\n\npublication issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that the\n\ndrawing of blood is the “standard screening test” used to determine the presence of HIV\n\nand that the accuracy of urine tests is “somewhat less than that of the blood . . . tests.”\n\nUnited States Dep’t of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and\n\nPrevention, What are the different HIV screening tests available in the U.S.?, at\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa8.htm (last visited Oct. 4, 2006). Thus, since a\n\nblood test had already been administered, prison medical personnel did not violate their\n\nstatutory testing duties by denying Daley’s request for urine and semen testing. It follows\n\nthat denial of Daley’s request does not evidence “deliberate indifference to serious\n\nmedical needs,” Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (1976), in violation of the Cruel and\n\nUnusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. See Doe v. Wigginton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667605\"><a href=\"/opinion/667605/john-doe-v-john-t-wigginton/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738-39 (6th Cir. 1994). Finally, we find no basis for Daley’s Fourteenth\n\nAmendment claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       We next address Daley’s allegations that the prison segregation unit’s law library\n\ndoes not contain adequate research materials and that he has been denied sufficient time\n\nto access the prison’s law libraries. Denial of access to a prison law library is actionable\n\nas a constitutional violation only insofar as the denial impedes a prisoner’s constitutional\n\nright of access to the courts. See Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350-51 (1996).\n\nAccordingly, a prisoner does not have standing to bring a denial of access suit if he\n\nmerely alleges that a prison law library is inaccessible or has a deficient collection of\n\nlegal research materials. See id. at 351. Rather, to gain standing, a prisoner must\n\ndemonstrate actual injury by alleging that the “shortcomings in the library or legal\n\nassistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.” Id.; see also Allah v.\n\nSeiverling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770720\"><a href=\"/opinion/770720/michael-malik-allah-v-thomas-seiverling-robert-sparbanie-john-deletto-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 n.5 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that prisoner has standing to\n\nbring right of access claim where complaint alleges that lack of access to prison library\n\nresulted in inability to file brief in post-conviction appeal). We agree with the District\n\nCourt that Daley’s right of access claims are without merit because he has failed to\n\ndescribe how the alleged inadequacies have impeded his ability to bring or prosecute a\n\nclaim. See Tourscher v. McCullough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765240\"><a href=\"/opinion/765240/mark-d-tourscher-v-martin-horn-secretary-of-the-pa-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (3d Cir. 1999) (affirming\n\ndismissal of right of access claim because prisoner failed to describe how prison\n\nworkload prevented him from pursuing his appeal); Reynolds v. Wagner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747610\"><a href=\"/opinion/747610/richard-reynolds-david-borrell-rolando-felix-julio-aracho-robert-santillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n182-83 (3d Cir. 1997) (affirming dismissal of right of access claim because plaintiffs\n\nfailed to allege actual injury derived from challenged prison policy). We also note that\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fwhile the original complaint cites various regulatory provisions that require federal prison\n\nwardens to ensure prisoners have access to certain minimal library services (i.e., 28\n\nC.F.R. §§ 543.11, 544.100, .101), Daley has failed to set forth comprehensible facts\n\nindicating that the warden has not met these requirements.\n\n         Finally, we note that the District Court properly dismissed Daley’s retaliation\n\nclaim because he has not alleged that he suffered adverse action as a result of exercising a\n\nconstitutional right. See Mitchell v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780725\"><a href=\"/opinion/780725/mark-mitchell-v-martin-f-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (3d Cir. 2003). Moreover,\n\nthe retaliation claim fails because he has not alleged that any defendant was personally\n\ninvolved in the wrongdoing. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the District Court that Daley has failed to\n\nstate a claim on which relief may be granted. We also agree that Daley’s objections to the\n\nDistrict Court’s adoption of the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation are\n\ngroundless. Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f</pre>",
