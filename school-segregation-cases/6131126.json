BLOMERTH, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n                This appeal arises out of a lower-tier subcontract related to a highway-construction\n\nproject. Appellant Star Operations, Inc. was hired as a subcontractor by Central Texas Highway\n\nConstructors, the design-build contractor for the project, to build infrastructure for the illumination,\n\nsignal, intelligent-transportation, and toll-collection systems as part of the construction of SH 130\n\ntoll-road Segments 5 and 6 southeast of Austin. Appellee Dig Tech, Inc. sued Star and its\n\npayment-bond surety, appellant Great American Insurance Company of New York, asserting that\n\nStar had breached an oral contract with Dig Tech. Dig Tech alleged that Star had hired it to perform\n\nsome of the hole-boring work for the installation of electrical conduit needed for Star to complete\n\nits part of the construction project and that Star did not pay Dig Tech for the work it did. After a jury\n\ntrial, the jury found in Dig Tech’s favor and awarded Dig Tech the amount of its unpaid invoices,\n\n$228,524, and attorneys’ fees. On appeal, Star and Great American Insurance raise fourteen issues\n\fchallenging the judgment. For the reasons explained below, we will affirm the judgment in part, and\n\nwe will reverse in part on the issue of court costs and remand the cause for further proceedings on\n\nthat issue.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) entered into a facility concession\n\nagreement (FCA) with SH 130 Concession Company, the developer, for SH 130 Concession to\n\nfinance and perform the construction of SH 130 toll-road Segments 5 and 6 southeast of Austin and\n\nto grant SH 130 Concession the concession to lease the sections and toll them for 50 years after the\n\nproject’s completion.1 See generally Tex. Transp. Code §§ 223.201-.209 (authorizing TxDOT to\n\nenter into public-private partnership agreements to facilitate private-sector investment and\n\nparticipation in development of state’s transportation system). SH 130 Concession hired Central\n\n\n\n\n        1\n           Star asserts that “it was undisputed and uncontroverted that the Project involved the use\nof federal funds.” We note that the record citations provided by Star include a citation to the section\nof TxDOT’s agreement with SH 130 Concession that states “[r]egardless of whether federal credit\nor funds are made available to Facility, Developer shall comply and require its Contractors to\ncomply with all federal requirements applicable to transportation projects that receive federal credit\nor funds, including those set forth in Exhibit 8.” (Emphasis added.) The remainder of its record\ncitations in support of this point are to Attachment 1 to Exhibit 8, which was attached to each of the\nparties’ individual subcontracts with Central Texas. That portion of the form attachment states:\n“The work herein proposed will be financed in whole or in part with Federal funds, and therefore\nall of the statutes, rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Government and applicable to\nwork financed in whole or in part with Federal funds will apply to such work.” No party has pointed\nus to any evidence in the record of the federal government’s participation in or funding of the project\noutside of these record citations. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume that the project\nreceived some unknown amount of federal funding because Dig Tech does not challenge\nStar’s assertion.\n\n                                                  2\n\fTexas Highway Constructors as the design-build contractor on the project. As previously mentioned,\n\nCentral Texas in turn hired Star as a subcontractor to build infrastructure for the illumination, signal,\n\nintelligent-transportation, and toll-collection systems. Star and Central Texas entered into two\n\nsubcontracting agreements related to this work. As part of those agreements, Central Texas required\n\nStar to furnish a performance bond and a payment bond for each subcontract. Star’s surety on the\n\nbonds is Great American. The payment bond at issue here provides that “Star Operations, Inc., as\n\nprincipal, . . . and Great American Insurance Company of New York, . . . as surety, . . . are held and\n\nfirmly bound unto CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTORS LLC as Obligee . . . for the\n\nuse and benefit of Claimants as herein below defined in the amount of . . . $3,100,000.00 for the\n\npayment whereof Principal and Surety bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators,\n\nsuccessors and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.”2 Central Texas also\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           There is no dispute that Dig Tech is a “claimant” as that term is defined in the bond. In\ntheir arguments about notice of the bond claim, however, Star and Great American allude to the fact\nthat Dig Tech’s May 1 notice letter only references one of the payment bonds and one of Star’s\nsubcontracts with Central Texas. When Dig Tech had not received payment from Star by late April,\non April 23, 2012, Dig Tech’s vice-president and owner Mike Furry requested “a copy of the\ncontract” between Star and Central Texas and “a copy of your payment bond” from Lana Lewis, the\npresident and founder of Star. Furry testified that he never received a copy of the contract from\nLewis. Later correspondence among the various entities involved in the projects refers to both\ncontracts and both bonds. The bond attached to the May 1 notice letter was admitted into evidence\nat trial. The judgment states that Great American “is obligated under the terms of its bond to make\nthe payments that Star Operations failed to make,” but does not specify the bond number. Star does\nnot assert on appeal that the work performed by Dig Tech related only to one or the other of its\nsubcontracts or that funds to pay the judgment are lacking under either bond. Because we have not\nbeen asked to determine whether both bonds applied to Dig Tech’s work or whether the trial court’s\naward refers to one or both bonds, we express no opinion and make no determination about whether\nthe judgment applies to one or both bonds. For simplicity’s sake, throughout this opinion, we will\nrefer to the “bond,” not the “bonds.”\n\n                                                   3\n\fseparately hired Dig Tech as a subcontractor responsible for relocating and adjusting\n\nelectric-distribution facilities owned by Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative. The contract at issue in\n\nthis case is an oral lower-tier subcontract that Star later entered into with Dig Tech for some\n\nhole-boring work for the installation of electrical conduit that Star needed done to complete its part\n\nof the construction project.3\n\n               Dig Tech completed the requested work and sought payment for it from Star. Dig\n\nTech sent Star a letter on March 13, 2012, requesting payment for the invoices that had been\n\nsubmitted before that time and copied Central Texas on the letter. After inquiry from Central Texas\n\nto Star on Friday, March 16, Star informed Central Texas that the invoices were set up to be paid the\n\nfollowing Tuesday. On April 12, Central Texas’s project-controls manager, Michael Kiehnau,\n\nemailed Star’s president and founder, Lana Lewis, to inform her that Dig Tech’s vice-president and\n\nowner, Mike Furry, had called Kiehnau to let him know that Star had not contacted Dig Tech about\n\npayment, and consequently, Dig Tech would be filing a bond claim. Kiehnau told Lewis, “I urge you\n\nto resolve this issue immediately.” On April 23, Furry requested that Lewis send him “a copy of the\n\ncontract between Star [O]perations and [Central Texas]. Also, I would like you to provide me with\n\na copy of your payment bond.” Furry testified that he never received a copy of the contract from\n\nLewis. On May 1, 2012, Dig Tech notified Star, Central Texas, and Great American of Dig Tech’s\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Although Star refers to this contract in its briefing as the “purported oral contract,” Star\ndoes not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict that “Dig Tech and\nStar Operations agree[d] that Dig Tech would conduct boring work for Star Operations, and that Star\nOperations would pay Dig Tech for such boring work.”\n\n                                                  4\n\fclaim via certified mail, return receipt requested, and further notified them that if all invoices were\n\nnot paid in full, Dig Tech would file suit on the bond “on the 91st day after April 4, 2012, the last\n\nday on which Dig Tech’s work or labor was done or performed.”4 Dig Tech subsequently filed suit\n\nagainst Star and Great American, alleging claims for breach of contract (express or implied),\n\nquantum meruit, and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                After a ten-day trial, the jury found that Dig Tech and Star Operations had an\n\nagreement that Dig Tech would perform hole-boring work for Star and Star would pay for that work,\n\nbut Star failed to comply with its agreement to pay and its failure to comply was unexcused.5 The\n\njury also found that although Dig Tech intentionally interfered with Star’s subcontract with\n\ndesign-build contractor Central Texas, Dig Tech did so only because it had a good-faith belief that\n\nit had a right to threaten garnishment for the work it performed and any harm to Star did not result\n\nfrom any malice on the part of Dig Tech. The jury further found that Star, but not Dig Tech, had\n\n“unclean hands.”\n\n                The jury awarded Dig Tech $228,524 for its unpaid work and also awarded attorneys’\n\nfees. The final judgment included an award of court costs, “including the cost of deposition\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           The bond states: “Principal [Star] and Surety [Great American] hereby jointly and\nseverally agree with the Obligee [Central Texas] that every Claimant as herein defined, who has not\nbeen paid in full before the expiration of a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which the last\nof such Claimant’s work or labor was done or performed, or materials were furnished by such\nClaimant, may sue on this bond for the use of such Claimant, prosecute the suit to final judgment\nof such sum or sums as may be justly due Claimant, and have execution thereon. The Obligee\n[Central Texas] shall not be liable for payment of any costs or expenses of any such suit.”\n        5\n         The evidence at trial included e-mails stating a quote and proposed terms, start date, and\nprojected duration of work, as well as evidence that the work was completed and accepted by Star.\n\n                                                   5\n\ftranscripts and subpoenas necessarily obtained for use in this suit,” pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 131. The trial court also ordered in the judgment that “Dig Tech substantially complied\n\nwith the notice provisions of the McGregor Act in order to perfect its bond claim against Great\n\nAmerican Insurance,” and accordingly, Great American “is obligated under the terms of its bond to\n\nmake the payments that Star Operations failed to make.” Star and Great American appeal from\n\nthe judgment.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                Star and Great American challenge the judgment in fourteen issues. Seven issues\n\nflow from their contention that the trial court should have applied federal law to Dig Tech’s contract\n\nclaim. Issues eight through eleven concern the law related to Dig Tech’s claim against the Great\n\nAmerican payment bond and whether Dig Tech perfected its claim against the bond. In their twelfth\n\nissue, Star and Great American contend that the trial court erred by awarding damages to Dig Tech\n\nwithout any evidence of Dig Tech’s actual damages as net loss after reduction of income-tax\n\npayments or unpaid income-tax liability, which they assert is required by Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 18.091. In issue thirteen, they challenge the trial court’s award of attorneys’\n\nfees to Dig Tech based on their contention that Dig Tech failed to segregate recoverable attorneys’\n\nfees from unrecoverable attorneys’ fees. In issue fourteen, Star and Great American argue that the\n\ntrial court erred by awarding Dig Tech costs for copies of deposition transcripts as “taxable costs”\n\nwhen Dig Tech did not notice or initiate the depositions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fApplication of the Christian doctrine\n\n               The first seven issues are related to Star and Great American’s contention that the trial\n\ncourt should have applied a federal-law principle, the Christian doctrine, to Dig Tech’s contract\n\nclaim because the highway project was federally funded. Star and Great American assert that the\n\nChristian case stands for the proposition that when the subject matter of a contract is governed by\n\nvalid federal regulations, the regulations are incorporated into the contract as a matter of law, even\n\nif the parties had not agreed to be bound by them. See G. L. Christian & Assocs. v. United States,\n\n312 F.2d 418, 424-26 (Ct. Cl. 1963), aff’d on reh’g, 320 F.2d 345 (Ct. Cl. 1963) (denying\n\ncontractor’s breach-of-contract claim when government terminated construction contract for its own\n\nconvenience even though contract lacked termination clause because court concluded that standard\n\ntermination clause required by Armed Service Procurement Regulations must be read into contract).\n\nAccording to Star and Great American, applying the Christian doctrine in this case means that Dig\n\nTech failed to comply with three conditions precedent. They contend that federal law required Dig\n\nTech to obtain a written contract with Star and to obtain approval from TxDOT for the oral contract\n\nwith Star as conditions precedent to formation of an enforceable contract. They further contend that\n\nfederal law required Dig Tech to provide statutorily compliant certified payrolls as a condition\n\nprecedent to any liability arising from Star’s failure to pay Dig Tech, and that the payrolls provided\n\nby Dig Tech were not statutorily compliant based on errors in the classification or pay rate of\n\napproximately four employees in a one-week period. Therefore, they argue that the trial court erred\n\nby refusing to submit jury questions on (1) Dig Tech’s alleged failure to obtain a written contract\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fwith Star, (2) Dig Tech’s alleged failure to obtain approval from TxDOT for the purported oral\n\ncontract with Star, and (3) Dig Tech’s alleged failure to provide statutorily compliant certified\n\npayrolls. They also argue that the trial court erred in awarding contract damages to Dig Tech based\n\non their contention that Dig Tech’s failure to satisfy these three conditions precedent renders the oral\n\nagreement that Dig Tech sued upon unenforceable by law. We first consider the effect of the\n\nChristian doctrine on Dig Tech’s contract claim.\n\n                Under the Christian doctrine, which has been developed in a line of decisions from\n\nthe Federal Circuit, “a mandatory contract clause that expresses a significant or deeply ingrained\n\nstrand of public procurement policy is considered to be included in a contract by operation of law.”\n\nS.J. Amoroso Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, 12 F.3d 1072, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (emphasis\n\nadded) (citing Christian, 312 F.2d at 424, 427). The doctrine “echoes Supreme Court law that the\n\nUnited States is neither bound nor estopped by its agents who act beyond their authority or contrary\n\nto statute and regulations,” and its application “turns not on whether the clause was intentionally or\n\ninadvertently omitted, but on whether procurement policies are being ‘avoided or evaded\n\n(deliberately or negligently) by lesser [governmental] officials.’” Id. (quoting Christian, 320 F.2d\n\nat 351). “Thus, under the Christian Doctrine a court may insert a clause into a government contract\n\nby operation of law if that clause is required under applicable federal administrative regulations,”\n\nso long as the clause “express[es] a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement\n\npolicy.” General Eng’g & Mach. Works v. O’Keefe, 991 F.2d 775, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (emphasis\n\nadded) (holding that Navy was entitled to reimbursement based on contractor’s failure to maintain\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fmaterial-handling charges in separate cost pool as required by regulatory payments clause\n\nincorporated into contract by operation of law). The Christian doctrine does not allow all mandatory\n\ncontract clauses to be automatically incorporated by operation of law into a contract. Id. The\n\ndoctrine is limited to those mandatory clauses expressing significant public procurement policy and\n\nto “less fundamental or significant mandatory procurement contract clauses if not written to benefit\n\nor protect the party seeking incorporation.” Id. at 779-80.\n\n               Star and Great American contend that the Christian doctrine should be applied to\n\nincorporate into the alleged oral agreement between Star and Dig Tech all applicable federal\n\nregulations, but most specifically those regulations requiring (1) prior written consent of TxDOT to\n\nany subcontract, (2) a written contract between Star and Dig Tech, and (3) Dig Tech’s provision of\n\nstatutorily compliant certified payroll. See 23 C.F.R. § 635.116(b) (subcontractor and contractor\n\nresponsibilities related to federally funded highway projects); 29 C.F.R. §§ 3.1-.11 (wage regulations\n\nfor contractors and subcontractors on public building or work financed with federal funds). Star and\n\nGreat American have not argued that these regulations “express a significant or deeply ingrained\n\nstrand of public procurement policy.” See General Eng’g & Mach. Works, 991 F.2d at 779. More\n\nimportantly, however, none of the regulations that Star and Great American want to incorporate in\n\nthe Dig Tech contract prescribe mandatory contract clauses like those incorporated into contracts\n\nunder the Christian doctrine. See, e.g., Amoroso, 12 F.3d at 1075 (applying Christian doctrine to\n\nconstruction contract to substitute mandatory clause of Buy American Act applicable to construction\n\ncontracts by operation of law when contract had incorrectly included clause for nonappropriated fund\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fsupply contracts); Christian, 312 F.2d at 424 (incorporating standard termination clause that\n\nregulation required to “be inserted in all fixed-price construction contracts amounting to more\n\nthan $1,000”).\n\n                 Section 635.116 of Title 23 establishes requirements for entering into a subcontract\n\non a federally funded highway project, but the regulation does not mandate that any specific clause\n\nbe incorporated into the contract:\n\n\n       The [state transportation department] shall not permit any of the contract work to be\n       performed under a subcontract, unless such arrangement has been authorized by the\n       [state transportation department] in writing. Prior to authorizing a subcontract, the\n       [state transportation department] shall assure that each subcontract is evidenced in\n       writing and that it contains all pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime\n       contract. The Division Administrator [chief federal highway administration official\n       for the particular state] may permit the [state transportation department] to satisfy the\n       subcontract assurance requirements by concurrence in a [state transportation\n       department] process which requires the contractor to certify that each subcontract\n       arrangement will be in the form of a written agreement containing all the\n       requirements and pertinent provisions of the prime contract. Prior to the Division\n       Administrator’s concurrence, the [state transportation department] must demonstrate\n       that it has an acceptable plan for monitoring such certifications.\n\n\n23 C.F.R. § 635.116(b). Similarly, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Title 29 require contractors and\n\nsubcontractors engaged in construction of any federally funded public work to furnish weekly wage\n\nstatements to the federal or state agency contracting for or financing the work and to keep payroll\n\nrecords reflecting the correct classification, rate of pay, hours worked, etc., for each worker, but\n\nthose sections do not mandate the inclusion of any specific clause into the contract or subcontract\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fgoverning the work.6 See generally 29 C.F.R. §§ 3.1-3.10 (prescribing anti-kickback regulations\n\nunder Copeland Act and regulations intended to aid in enforcement of minimum-wage\n\nrequirements); see also id. § 3.11 (requiring federally funded public-work contracts to expressly bind\n\ncontractors or subcontractors to comply with applicable regulations, but not mandating inclusion of\n\nspecific clause). Star and Great American seek to broaden the reach of the Christian doctrine,\n\narguing not only that under the doctrine all applicable federal regulations should be incorporated into\n\nthe subcontract between Dig Tech and Star, but also that those incorporated regulations should be\n\nread as implied conditions precedent to the formation or performance of the oral subcontract. We\n\ndecline to extend the reach of the Christian doctrine in this manner. Based on this record, we\n\nconclude that the regulations relied upon by Star and Great American do not require the\n\nincorporation of any mandatory contract clauses under the Christian doctrine into the oral\n\nsubcontract between Dig Tech and Star.\n\n               Star and Great American also argue, however, that the federal requirements were\n\nexpressly incorporated into any and all contracts on the highway project, and thus would be\n\nincorporated into any subcontract between Dig Tech and Star. While Star and Great American are\n\ncorrect that the federal requirements were expressly incorporated into Central Texas’s subcontracts\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Evidence was admitted at trial that Dig Tech submitted certified payroll records to Star for\nthe twenty-six-week period that Dig Tech performed work for Star on the project. Star points to\nevidence in the record that four individuals were either misclassified or paid the wrong amount of\nhourly pay for their classification or both for at least one week that they worked and an instance in\nwhich two employees were listed incorrectly as being paid straight time when they had worked\novertime in one week. Dig Tech responds by pointing to evidence in the record that Star never\nreviewed the certified payrolls that were submitted or notified Dig Tech of any compliance issues\nso that Dig Tech could correct them until after Dig Tech filed suit against Star.\n\n                                                  11\n\fwith Star and with Dig Tech, as required by the FCA (the contract between TxDOT and SH 130\n\nConcession Company),7 the FCA also explicitly provides that those provisions “shall not be\n\nincorporated by reference in any case” in any lower-tier subcontracts.\n\n               “FCA Exhibit 8—Federal Requirements” is an attachment to Star’s subcontracts with\n\nCentral Texas and to Dig Tech’s contract with Central Texas, and its Attachment 2 (titled “Required\n\nContract Provisions Federal-Aid Construction Contracts”) contains the following general provision:\n\n\n       Except as otherwise provided for in each section, the contractor [Central Texas]\n       shall insert in each subcontract all of the stipulations contained in these Required\n       Contract Provisions, and further require their inclusion in any lower tier subcontract\n       or purchase order that may in turn be made. The Required Contract Provisions shall\n       not be incorporated by reference in any case. The prime contractor [Central Texas]\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           The FCA provides:\n\n       Developer [SH 130 Concession Company] shall comply and require its contractors\n       to comply with all federal requirements applicable to transportation projects that\n       receive federal credit or funds, including those set forth in Exhibit 8.\n\nIn FCA Section 10.2, concerning “Responsibility for Work, Contractors and Employees,” the FCA\nfurther provides that:\n\n       Each Contract shall include terms and conditions sufficient to ensure compliance by\n       the Contractor with the requirements of the FCA Documents, and shall include those\n       terms that are specifically required by the FCA Documents to be included therein\n       including, to the extent applicable, those set forth in Exhibit 8.\n\nStar’s subcontracts with Central Texas and Dig Tech’s subcontract with Central Texas expressly\nincorporate the entire FCA into those subcontracts:\n\n       Facility Concession Agreement (FCA) is the agreement between the Developer [SH\n       130 Concession Company] and the Texas Department of Transportation. The FCA\n       and related FCA documents are incorporated into this Subcontract Agreement.\n\n                                                12\n\f       shall be responsible for compliance by any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor\n       with these Required Contract provisions.8\n\n\n(Emphases added.) Attachment 2’s Section VII, “Subletting or Assigning the Contract,” includes\n\nthe following provision:\n\n\n       No portion of the contract shall be sublet, assigned or otherwise disposed of except\n       with the written consent of the SHA [state highway authority] contracting officer\n       [defined as TxDOT or its Authorized Representative], or authorized representative,\n       and such consent when given shall not be construed to relieve the contractor [defined\n       as Design-Build Contractor (Central Texas)] of any responsibility for the fulfillment\n       of the contract. Written consent will be given only after the [state highway authority]\n       has assured that each subcontract is evidenced in writing and that it contains all\n       pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime contract.\n\n\nIn Section V, “Statements and Payrolls,” Attachment 2 also incorporates by express reference the\n\nCopeland Act regulations found in 29 C.F.R. pt. 3 and includes the requirement of weekly\n\nsubmission of certified payroll statements, as provided in those regulations.\n\n               However, Star’s subcontracts with Central Texas also include the following provision\n\nconcerning lower-tier subcontracts:\n\n\n       9.4 SUBCONTRACTS. Seller [Star Operations] shall not subcontract any Work\n       . . . without the prior written consent of D&C Contractor [Central Texas], which\n       consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller [Star] shall be solely\n       responsible for the engagement and management of its Subcontractors in the\n       performance of the Work, for the performance of Work by its Subcontractors and for\n       all acts or omissions of Subcontractors. Seller shall insure that all Work furnished\n       or performed by Subcontractors conforms to the requirements of the Agreement\n       Documents. Neither the consent by D&C Contractor, nor anything contained herein,\n\n\n       8\n         Attachment 1 to Exhibit 8 establishes the following definitions for the required contract\nprovisions included in Exhibit 8: “‘contractor,’ ‘prime contractor,’ ‘bidder’ or ‘prospective\nprimary participant’ . . . shall be construed to mean the Design-Build Contractor or its\nauthorized representative.”\n\n                                                 13\n\f       shall create any contractual relationship between any lower tier Subcontractor and\n       D&C Contractor. All lower-tier subcontracts must contain the terms and conditions\n       that are incorporated in this Agreement.\n\n       No Subcontractor is intended to be or shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary\n       of the Agreement. Each agreement between Seller and any Subcontractor shall be\n       in writing, and shall be assignable to D&C Contractor upon the completion or\n       termination of the Work. A copy of each such agreement with pricing removed shall\n       be provided to D&C Contractor upon request.\n\n       . . . . The Seller agrees that it is fully responsible to the D&C Contractor for the acts\n       and omissions of its subcontractors . . . .\n\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n               Construing all of these provisions together, we conclude that the parties’ subcontracts\n\nwith Central Texas expressly contained the federal requirements that were included as terms of the\n\nFCA. But nothing in the record indicates that the parties intended to incorporate those requirements\n\ninto Star’s oral contract with Dig Tech, and we have concluded that the Christian doctrine does not\n\nrequire their wholesale incorporation into that contract. In fact, the federal requirements themselves\n\nstate that “[t]he Required Contract Provisions shall not be incorporated by reference in any case.”\n\nWe note that Section 9.4 of Star’s contract with Central Texas explicitly places responsibility on Star\n\nfor the engagement of any lower-tier subcontractors and the lower-tier subcontractor’s acts and\n\nomissions. To the extent that Star’s contract with Central Texas required any lower-tier subcontracts\n\nto be in writing and approved by TxDOT, it was the responsibility of Star, not the lower-tier\n\nsubcontractor engaged by Star, to ensure compliance. In this case, Star seeks to use its own\n\nnoncompliance with its subcontracts with Central Texas as a defense to enforcement of its oral\n\ncontract with Dig Tech.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f               In essence, Star seeks to use promises it made to perform in its contract with Central\n\nTexas to create conditions precedent in Star’s separate contract with Dig Tech. Conditions precedent\n\nare not favored in the law. When courts construe contracts, “forfeiture by finding a condition\n\nprecedent is to be avoided when another reasonable reading of the contract is possible.” Criswell\n\nv. European Crossroads Shopping Ctr., Ltd., 792 S.W.2d 945, 948 (Tex. 1990) (citing\n\nSchwarz-Jordan, Inc. of Hous. v. Delisle Constr. Co., 569 S.W.2d 878, 881 (Tex. 1978)). “A\n\ncondition precedent may be either a condition to the formation of a contract or to an obligation to\n\nperform an existing agreement. Conditions may, therefore, relate either to the formation of contracts\n\nor to liability under them.” Hohenberg Bros. Co. v. George E. Gibbons & Co., 537 S.W.2d 1, 3\n\n(Tex. 1976); see also Rincones v. Windberg, 705 S.W.2d 846, 848 (Tex. App.—Austin 1986, no\n\nwrit) (distinguishing between condition precedent, which postpones effective date of instrument until\n\nhappening of contingency, and condition subsequent, which refers to future event that excuses\n\nobligation to perform an already binding contract).\n\n               A condition precedent to formation occurs if the parties to a contract agree that it shall\n\nnot become effective or binding until or unless some specified condition is performed or occurs. See\n\nPerry v. Little, 377 S.W.2d 765, 769 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1964, writ ref’d n.r.e.). “Conditions\n\nprecedent to an obligation to perform are those acts or events, which occur subsequently to the\n\nmaking of a contract, that must occur before there is a right to immediate performance and before\n\nthere is a breach of contractual duty.” Hohenberg Bros., 537 S.W.2d at 3. When construing written\n\ncontracts, although no particular words are required for the existence of a condition, terms such as\n\n“if,” “provided that,” or “on condition that,” usually indicate an intent that the provision be a\n\ncondition precedent rather than a promise. Id. To determine whether a condition precedent exists,\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fwe must ascertain the intention of the parties by looking at the whole contract. Criswell, 792 S.W.2d\n\nat 948.\n\n                Courts look to the communications between the parties, as well as to the acts and\n\ncircumstances surrounding their communications, when determining the existence and terms of an\n\noral contract. See Davis v. Chaparro, 431 S.W.3d 717, 722 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2014, pet. denied)\n\n(holding evidence supported trial court’s finding of meeting of minds to pay reasonable fee for\n\nservices rendered based on parties’ conversations). Star points to no evidence in the record, and we\n\nhave found no evidence, that indicates the parties intended the agreement between Star and Dig Tech\n\nto become binding only after it was memorialized in a written contract and approved by TxDOT.\n\nStar’s allegation that Dig Tech was required to submit statutorily compliant certified payroll to Star\n\nas a condition precedent to Star’s obligation to pay Dig Tech for its work is likewise not supported\n\nby the evidence in the record. Although Dig Tech submitted a certified payroll report to Star each\n\nweek during the period that it did work for Star, as required by federal regulations, there is no\n\nevidence of Star and Dig Tech communicating about making payment conditional on submission of\n\nstatutorily compliant payroll before Dig Tech began its work, and the parties’ actions afterward also\n\nsupport the conclusion that the parties had not agreed on such a condition. Star’s human-resources\n\nand payroll director testified that she did not do anything with Dig Tech’s certified payroll statements\n\nexcept electronically store them in a computer file; Star never forwarded the certified payroll\n\nstatements to Central Texas; Star’s president testified that she never reviewed the payroll statements\n\nbefore Dig Tech filed suit or discussed any classifications in the payroll statements with her\n\nemployees or Dig Tech; and Star’s president never told Dig Tech that one of the reasons Star refused\n\nto pay is because of any mistake or error in the payroll statements or provided Dig Tech with an\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fopportunity to correct the errors that Star asserts are in some of the certified payroll statements.\n\nFurthermore, Star’s president admitted that Star refused to pay Dig Tech before she had ever\n\nreviewed Dig Tech’s certified payroll statements. We conclude that the parties never agreed that\n\nthese three federal requirements should be conditions precedent to their agreement that Dig Tech\n\nwould perform hole-boring work for Star.\n\n               We overrule Star’s first seven issues. The trial court correctly concluded as a matter\n\nof law that the Christian doctrine did not require the incorporation of the three federal requirements\n\npropounded by Star into Star’s subcontract with Dig Tech. While those three requirements were\n\nexpress provisions of Star’s contracts with Central Texas and Dig Tech’s contracts with Central\n\nTexas, they were not incorporated into Star’s oral subcontract with Dig Tech. Star and Dig Tech did\n\nnot agree to make them conditions precedent to the formation or enforceability of Star’s subcontract\n\nwith Dig Tech. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to submit proposed jury questions\n\non the lack of a written contract, the lack of TxDOT approval of the oral contract, or Dig Tech’s\n\nalleged failure to provide statutorily compliant certified payroll statements. Likewise, because the\n\nthree federal requirements were not conditions precedent to the formation of an enforceable contract,\n\nthe trial court did not err by awarding Dig Tech contract damages.\n\n\nDig Tech’s claim against the Great American payment bond\n\n               In issues eight through eleven, Star and Great American challenge the trial court’s\n\napplication of the law to Dig Tech’s claim against the payment bond. Star and Great American\n\nassert that the federal Miller Act applies to the project, and therefore, federal courts have exclusive\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the bond dispute. Alternatively, if the Texas McGregor Act applies,\n\nStar and Great American assert that the evidence at trial showed that Dig Tech failed to comply with\n\n                                                  17\n\fthat Act’s notice requirements and thus failed to perfect its bond claim as a matter of law. Star and\n\nGreat American consequently challenge the trial court’s ruling as a matter of law that Dig Tech\n\nperfected its bond claim, the trial court’s denial of Great American’s motion for instructed verdict\n\nand of Star and Great American’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the trial\n\ncourt’s refusal to submit Great American’s proposed jury questions on whether Dig Tech\n\nsubstantially complied with the McGregor Act’s notice requirements.\n\n\nMiller Act v. McGregor Act\n\n               We first consider whether the Miller Act applies to Dig Tech’s bond claim.9 The\n\nMiller Act requires bonds to be issued as follows:\n\n\n       (b)     Type of bonds required.--Before any contract of more than $100,000 is\n               awarded for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or\n               public work of the Federal Government, a person must furnish to the\n               Government the following bonds, which become binding when the contract\n               is awarded:\n\n               (1)     Performance bond.--A performance bond with a surety satisfactory\n                       to the officer awarding the contract, and in an amount the officer\n                       considers adequate, for the protection of the Government.\n\n               (2)     Payment bond.--A payment bond with a surety satisfactory to the\n                       officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material\n                       in carrying out the work provided for in the contract for the use of\n                       each person. The amount of the payment bond shall equal the total\n                       amount payable by the terms of the contract unless the officer\n                       awarding the contract determines, in a writing supported by specific\n                       findings, that a payment bond in that amount is impractical, in which\n                       case the contracting officer shall set the amount of the payment bond.\n\n\n\n       9\n         Star and Great American raised this issue in a plea to the jurisdiction, in Great American’s\nmotion for directed verdict, and in Star and Great American’s motion for judgment notwithstanding\nthe verdict; none of these motions were granted.\n\n                                                 18\n\f                        The amount of the payment bond shall not be less than the amount of\n                        the performance bond.\n\n\n40 U.S.C. § 3131(b) (italics added). Article 7 of the contracts between Central Texas and Star\n\nrequired Star to provide both a performance bond and a payment bond each in an amount equal to\n\nthe full contract price on forms attached to the contracts. The bond at issue in this case is the\n\npayment bond issued by Star and Great American on behalf of Central Texas. The “Subcontract\n\nLabor and Material Payment Bond” that Star and Great American executed is a payment bond\n\nprovided for the use and benefit of claimants who furnish labor or materials required for use in the\n\nperformance of Star’s contract with Central Texas. The bond provides that Star, Great American,\n\nand Central Texas agree that claimants not timely paid in full may sue on the bond “in a state court\n\nof competent jurisdiction in and for the county or other political subdivision of the state in which the\n\nproject, or any part thereof, is situated, or in the United States District Court for the district in which\n\nthe project, or any part thereof, is situated, and not elsewhere.”\n\n                Star and Great American argue that the Miller Act requires contractors on “public\n\nwork” projects to provide performance and payment bonds and that this highway project is a public\n\nwork because it is a federally funded project for the purpose of creating a roadway for public use.\n\nStar relies on a Fifth Circuit case, Continental Casualty Co. v. C.O. Brand, Inc., for the proposition\n\nthat “a ‘public work’ within the Miller Act is ‘any work in which the United States is interested and\n\nwhich is done for the public and for which the United States is authorized to expend funds.’”\n\n355 F.2d 969, 974 (5th Cir. 1966) (quoting Peterson v. United States ex rel. Marsh Lumber Co.,\n\n119 F.2d 145, 147 (6th Cir. 1941)). In Continental Casualty, the court was not considering whether\n\nto apply either the Miller Act or a state act requiring bonds in a construction project. The issue in\n\n\n                                                    19\n\fthat case was whether the notice provision of the Miller Act requiring notice only to the prime\n\ncontractor or the dual-notice provision of the Capeheart Military Housing Act requiring notice to any\n\ntwo of the prime contractor, any one of the obligees, and the surety should apply in a suit on a\n\nCapeheart Act bond. Id. at 970. In making the statement quoted by Star, the court was disagreeing\n\nwith the Tenth Circuit’s holding that Capeheart Act housing projects are not “public works” within\n\nthe meaning of the Miller Act. Id. at 974.\n\n                In a more recent case deciding whether the Miller Act should apply to a company’s\n\nbonds issued for various “public-works contracts” entered into with Arizona state and municipal\n\nentities, including highway construction with funding from the Federal Highway Administration, the\n\nNinth Circuit upheld the district court’s determination that the projects were not “public works of\n\nthe United States.” Operating Eng’rs Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. JWJ Contracting Co.,\n\n135 F.3d 671, 675-76 (9th Cir. 1998). The court explained that:\n\n\n        Although there is no clear test for designating a project a “public work of the United\n        States,” courts often look to the following as indicia: whether the United States is a\n        contracting party, an obligee to the bond, an initiator or ultimate operator of the\n        project; whether the work is done on property belonging to the United States; or\n        whether the bonds are issued under the Miller Act.10\n\n\n        10\n           Star relies on two cases that it asserts stand for the proposition that the Miller Act applies\nto “public works,” even if the United States does not own the real estate, is not a party to the\nconstruction contract, and is not an obligee on the bond. See Roth Bros., Inc. v. Ohio Farmers Ins.\nCo., 1:12-CV-0158-JMS-DKL, 2012 WL 2120013 (S.D. Ind. June 11, 2012) (order denying motion\nto dismiss); Sullivan v. Faras-RLS Grp., Ltd., 795 F. Supp. 305 (D. Ariz. 1992). Both are\ndistinguishable from the facts in this case. In Sullivan, the project was initiated by the United States\nPostal Service, funded entirely with federal funds through the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs,\nbuilt to Postal Service specifications and federal construction-project standards, “located on a\n‘federal Indian reservation,’” and leased to the federal government for twenty years. Sullivan,\n795 F. Supp. at 306. When concluding the Miller Act applied to the post-office project, the court\ndistinguished the project at issue from another case in part because the state highway project in the\nother case, like the project at issue in this case, was only partially federally funded, was not built for\n\n                                                   20\n\fId. at 675. The court concluded that all those indicia were absent in the case before it, and in\n\naddition, that JWJ Contracting as principal and Continental Insurance as its surety were unlikely to\n\nhave issued the bonds in the sum total amount payable under the contract terms as required by state\n\nlaw when they could have issued them for half that amount under the terms of the Miller Act then\n\nin effect. Id. at 675-76. Moreover, the court determined that the bonds were not “furnished to the\n\nUnited States” or “for the protection of the United States,” as required by the Miller Act. Id. at 676;\n\nsee also 40 U.S.C. § 3131(b).\n\n               In this case, the United States or an agency of the United States or a person acting as\n\nthe agent of the United States did not contract for the work at issue. See United States ex rel. Miller\n\nv. Mattingly Bridge Co., 344 F. Supp. 459, 461 (W.D. Ky. 1972) (holding that Miller Act applies\n\nonly in these situations based on its construction of word “contracts” as covering only contracts\n\nbetween United States and prime contractor, not contracts to which United States was not a party).\n\nThe bond here was issued on the contract between Star, as subcontractor, and Central Texas, as\n\nprime contractor. Star does not contend that either of these parties was acting as an agent of the\n\nUnited States. In addition, the United States government is not an initiator or ultimate operator of\n\nthe project, and the work was not done on property belonging to the United States. See Operating\n\nEng’rs, 135 F.3d at 675-76. The property is not intended to be leased to any agency of the United\n\nStates government, and “the project [is] to benefit the people of [Texas] and not the general public\n\nof the United States.” See Sullivan v. Faras-RLS Grp., Ltd., 795 F. Supp. 305, 307 (D. Ariz. 1992).\n\n\n\nleasing to the United States, and “was to benefit the people of [the state] and not the general public\nof the United States.” Id. at 307. Similarly, the bond claim at issue in Roth Brothers involved a\nbuilding project for a building to be leased to the federal government and used for the FBI.\n2012 WL 2120013, at *1-2.\n\n                                                  21\n\fFurthermore, the Miller Act specifically requires that the payment bond be furnished to the United\n\nStates government. 40 U.S.C. § 3131(b). The contract between Central Texas and Star required that\n\nthe bond be furnished to Central Texas, and there is no evidence in the record showing that the bond\n\nat issue was furnished to the United States, rather than Central Texas, or that the United States was\n\nalso an obligee on the bond. See United States ex rel. Tri-State Road Boring, Inc. v. United States\n\nFid. & Guar. Co., 959 F. Supp. 345, 347 (E.D. La. 1996) (holding subcontractor’s payment bond on\n\ncontract for construction of airport control tower was not Miller Act bond because it was not\n\nfurnished to United States). In addition, the form of the bond itself provided that suit may be brought\n\nin state court or federal court where the project is situated, providing another indication that the\n\nparties did not intend for the bond to be construed as a Miller Act bond, because federal courts have\n\nexclusive subject-matter jurisdiction over Miller Act claims. See United States ex rel. Harvey Gulf\n\nInt’l Marine, Inc. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 573 F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir. 1978) (noting federal courts’\n\nexclusive jurisdiction over Miller Act claims). For all these reasons, we conclude that the bond was\n\nnot issued on a contract governed by the Miller Act.\n\n               We conclude that the trial court correctly decided as a matter of law that the Miller\n\nAct did not deprive it of subject-matter jurisdiction over Dig Tech’s suit seeking payment on the\n\nbond. We overrule Star and Great American’s eighth issue.\n\n\nApplication of the McGregor Act\n\n               Star and Great American argue in the alternative that if the McGregor Act applies to\n\nDig Tech’s claim against the bond, the trial court erred by ruling as a matter of law that Dig Tech\n\nperfected its claim. At trial, evidence was admitted showing that Dig Tech provided notice to Star,\n\nCentral Texas, and Great American of its claim on the payment bond that Central Texas required\n\n                                                  22\n\fStar to furnish as part of the subcontracts between Central Texas and Star. Star and Great American\n\nchallenge the effectiveness of Dig Tech’s notice to Central Texas and to Great American. At the\n\nclose of Dig Tech’s case, Great American moved for directed verdict on the notice issues, which it\n\nhad previously raised in defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction. Great American argued that Dig Tech\n\nnever gave notice to the “prime contractor,” as that term is defined in the Act, and never gave sworn\n\nnotice to Great American, as required by the Act. The trial court denied Great American’s motion.\n\nLater in trial, during the charge conference, Dig Tech asked the trial court for an order that “Dig\n\nTech has substantially complied with the notice provisions such that [Great American] has notice\n\nof our bond claim.” The trial judge stated that he was not submitting that issue to the jury and\n\n“essentially that’s exactly what’s happened here. . . . I’ve agreed not to submit this to the jury as a\n\nfact question — as a matter of law[,] I’m making that determination . . . .”\n\n               Star and Great American contend that this was error because Dig Tech failed to\n\ncomply in two ways with the Act’s notice provisions. First, they assert that the Act required Dig\n\nTech to provide notice to the “prime contractor” of its claim, and that as the Act defines “prime\n\ncontractor,” the prime contractor in this case was SH 130 Concession. See Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§§ 2253.001 (defining “prime contractor” as “a person, firm, or corporation that makes a public work\n\ncontract with a governmental entity”), .041 (establishing notice to prime contractor and surety\n\nrequired from payment-bond beneficiary for payment claim), .047 (establishing additional notice\n\nrequired from payment-bond beneficiary without direct contractual relationship with prime\n\ncontractor). Second, they assert that Dig Tech never provided a sworn statement of account to Great\n\nAmerican that complied with the requirements of Section 2253.041.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f               The Texas Legislature passed the McGregor Act to create a method to ensure that\n\nsubcontractors and suppliers on public-works projects are paid for their labor and materials because\n\nthey generally may not place liens against public buildings or other public works.

Substantial\n\ncompliance has been defined as satisfaction of the “essential requirements of a statute” and occurs\n\nwhen an actor’s deviation does not seriously impede the legislative purpose of the statutory\n\nrequirements. See Stratton v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 8 S.W.3d 26, 30 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999,\n\nno pet.).\n\n               Star and Great American argue that their complaints about Dig Tech’s notice are\n\nanalogous to the issues in cases holding that untimely notification does not substantially comply with\n\nthe McGregor Act. See, e.g., Suretec, 232 S.W.3d at 815-16; Laboratory Design & Equip., Inc.\n\nv. Brooks Dev. Auth., No. 04-07-00284-CV, 2008 WL 36614, at *3 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\nJan. 2, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding as matter of law that notice mailed over one year late\n\nwithout sworn statement prevented subcontractor from recovering against payment bond). The\n\nsubstance of Star and Great American’s issues with Dig Tech’s notice, however, is not that the notice\n\nwas untimely. Instead, they argue that Great American never received the sworn statement required\n\nto be delivered with notice of the claim and that Dig Tech did not serve the proper party as\n\nprime contractor.\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f               We first address Star and Great American’s argument that Great American never\n\nreceived the sworn statement required to be delivered with notice of the claim because our\n\ndisposition of that issue aids in our resolution of the other notice issue. Dig Tech’s counsel sent\n\nGreat American a letter via certified mail on May 1, 2012 (with return receipt signed May 7),\n\ninforming Great American that the law firm represented Dig Tech in its claim for unpaid amounts\n\ndue based on labor and materials provided to Star on the SH 130 Segments 5 and 6 project. The\n\nletter advised Great American that no payments at all had been made to Dig Tech, and accordingly,\n\nsuit would be filed on the bond “on the 91st day after April 4, 2012, the last day on which Dig Tech’s\n\nwork or labor was done or performed, if all invoices have not been paid in full by that time.” The\n\nletter further advised Great American that all invoices and claims for payment had previously been\n\nsent to Star and that “the invoices and descriptions of work” were copied and enclosed with the\n\nletter. Great American does not dispute that the invoices and descriptions were attached to the letter.\n\nGreat American also does not assert that the amount claimed was later materially amended.\n\n               While notice is a substantive condition precedent to a party’s ability to pursue a claim\n\non a bond, numerous courts have liberally construed the requirement that written notice of a claim\n\n“must be accompanied by a sworn statement of account that states in substance: (1) the amount\n\nclaimed is just and correct; and (2) all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits known to the\n\naffiant have been allowed.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.041(c) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Boring\n\n& Tunneling Co., 321 S.W.3d at 28-29 (First Court of Appeals); Kirby Rest. Equip., 170 S.W.3d at\n\n147-48 (Fourth Court of Appeals); Acme Brick, 816 S.W.2d at 441 (Tenth Court of Appeals);\n\nFeatherlite, 714 S.W.2d at 69-70 (Fourteenth Court of Appeals); Parker Bros. & Co., 437 S.W.2d\n\nat 881-82 (First Court of Appeals). Dig Tech’s letter indicated that it was presenting a claim for\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f“unpaid amounts due” for work completed for Star. This type of language has been deemed\n\nsufficient to inform the surety in substance that the amount claimed is “just and correct” and that “all\n\njust and lawful offsets, payments, and credits known to the affiant have been allowed.” See Kirby\n\nRest. Equip., 170 S.W.3d at 148 & n.2. Great American also contends that because no sworn\n\nstatement accompanied the notice, Dig Tech failed to perfect its claim, relying on Laboratory\n\nDesign. See 2008 WL 36614, at *3 (holding claimant who mailed notice over one year after\n\nstatutory deadline without including sworn statement did not substantially comply with statutory\n\nrequirements). The opinion in that case describes an earlier letter informing the governmental\n\nauthority (acting as surety) of the amount owed, but it does not provide any description of the later\n\nletter filed over a year after the deadline that the claimant argued substantially complied with the\n\nstatutory requirements. See id. at *1 (describing June 3, 2004 letter), *3 (identifying letter mailed\n\nJune 15, 2005, as letter relied on to establish notice of claim). Consequently, it is unclear what, if\n\nany, similarity the notice letter in that case has to the notice letter in this case. In addition, the court\n\nin Laboratory Design does not appear to have been presented with the issue of actual notice, which\n\nalso makes it distinguishable from the facts here.\n\n                In this case, Dig Tech presented evidence at trial supporting its contention that its\n\nnotice to Great American substantially complied with the McGregor Act and that Great American\n\nhad actual notice of Dig Tech’s claim. Substantial compliance occurs “‘when an actor’s deviation\n\nfrom compliance [with the essential requirements of a statute] does not seriously impede the\n\nlegislative purpose of the statute,’ that is, when actual notice of the claims are provided.” Dudley\n\nConstr., Ltd. v. Act Pipe & Supply, Inc., ___ S.W.3d ___, 06-15-00045-CV, 2016 WL 3917211, at\n\n*9 (Tex. App.—Texarkana July 14, 2016, pet. granted) (quoting Boring & Tunneling Co.,\n\n\n                                                    28\n\f321 S.W.3d at 28, and holding sufficient evidence to support finding of substantial compliance when\n\nentity’s former name was used on notices to prime contractor but actual notice was received). In this\n\ncase, Dig Tech’s May 1 letter sent via certified mail to Great American and the May 9 letter from\n\nCentral Texas to Star claimed an amount due based on the invoices included in the claim that was\n\nsubstantially the same as the amount Dig Tech sought at trial and was awarded. In addition, two\n\nother documents admitted at trial support Dig Tech’s claim that Great American had actual notice\n\nof the claim. The first document is a May 18, 2012 email from Star’s president to a Star employee,\n\nwhich states “Anthony - Please forward me any email correspondence you have concerning Dig\n\nTech. I need to respond and coordinate with our attorney and surety. Please send today as this has\n\nbeen escalated.” (Emphasis added.) The second document is a February 1, 2013 letter from Star’s\n\npresident presenting a formal prompt-payment complaint against Central Texas. In that letter, Star’s\n\npresident states the following: “Dig Tech has asserted NO CLAIMS against [Central Texas]. Dig\n\nTech asserted claims against STAR back in May 2012 and filed notice on STAR’S BOND furnished\n\nfor the benefit of [Central Texas]. Star provided payment and performance bonds to [Central Texas]\n\nfor both subcontract agreements . . . . Central Texas has no contractual reason to withhold funds\n\nclaimed by Dig Tech.” (Italics added.)\n\n               The legislative purpose of the McGregor Act “is to protect claimants who supply\n\nlabor and material in the construction of public works, and to provide a simple and direct method\n\nof giving notice and perfecting claims.” Argee, 932 S.W.2d at 52-53. The evident purpose of the\n\nAct’s requirement that a claimant accompany its written notice of a claim to a surety with a sworn\n\nstatement is to provide the surety with true and accurate information about the amount of the claim,\n\nso that the surety may prepare to defend against the claim. On this record, Dig Tech’s deviation from\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fthe Act’s requirement to include a sworn statement has not seriously hindered the legislature’s\n\npurpose in imposing the sworn-statement requirement because Great American had actual notice of\n\ntrue and accurate information about the amount of the claim. See Stratton, 8 S.W.3d at 31. Actual\n\nnotice to the surety constitutes substantial compliance with the notice requirements. See Dudley\n\nConstr., Ltd., ___ S.W.3d ___, 2016 WL 3917211, at *9.\n\n               Similarly, on this record, we conclude that Dig Tech’s provision of actual notice to\n\nboth Star, the principal and obligor on the bond, and Great American, the surety, constitutes\n\nsubstantial compliance with the Act’s requirement that the claimant notify the prime contractor and\n\nsurety. See Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 2253.041, .047. As an initial matter, Star and Great American fail\n\nto explain why lack of notice to SH 130 Concession should preclude Dig Tech from recovery on the\n\nbond, when Dig Tech notified the three parties named on the bond—the obligee, Central Texas; the\n\nprincipal and obligor, Star; and the surety, Great American. See Redland Ins. Co. v. Southwest\n\nStainless, L.P., 181 S.W.3d 509, 512-13 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, no pet.) (holding\n\nsubcontractor’s failure to send notice of claim to prime contractor via certified mail did not preclude\n\nsubcontractor from recovery on bond when surety received actual notice that complied with statutory\n\nrequirements); see also Argee Corp., 932 S.W.2d at 53 (“We do not perceive the legislative purpose\n\nbehind the McGregor Act to be that of creating technical tricks, traps and stumbling blocks to the\n\nfiling of legitimate notices of claims.”).\n\n               Moreover, the only payment bond required under the Act is the bond that the\n\ngovernmental entity requires the prime contractor to obtain. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.021(a)(2), (c).\n\nOn that bond, the governmental entity is the obligee, while the prime contractor is the principal and\n\nobligor who is liable and who may be sued jointly and severally with its surety by a payment-bond\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fbeneficiary if a claim is not paid. In contrast, on the bond at issue in this case, Central Texas is the\n\nobligee, while Star is the principal and obligor who is liable and who may be sued jointly and\n\nseverally with Great American, its surety, if a claim is not paid. The parties do not dispute that Dig\n\nTech is a payment-bond beneficiary of Great American’s bond, which was provided by Star for the\n\nprotection of Cental Texas, the obligee named in the bond, from claims by subcontractors\n\nand suppliers.\n\n                 The McGregor Act contemplates projects that are more simply structured than the\n\nproject at issue here. The Act requires a governmental entity that makes a public-work contract with\n\na prime contractor to require the contractor to execute payment and performance bonds in favor of\n\nthe governmental entity before work begins. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.021(a). The performance\n\nbond protects the state or governmental entity, id. § 2253.021(b), while the payment bond protects\n\n“payment bond beneficiaries who have a direct contractual relationship with the prime contractor\n\nor a subcontractor to supply public work labor or material,” id. § 2253.021(c)(1). The Act does not\n\nmandate that subcontractors on a public-work project obtain payment bonds. In this case, the\n\nSH 130 Segments 5 and 6 construction project was governed by a comprehensive development\n\nagreement (CDA) involving multiple contracts, including the Facility Concession Agreement\n\nentered into by TxDOT and SH 130 Concession Company.11 See generally Tex. Transp. Code\n\n§§ 223.201-.209 (authorizing TxDOT to enter into CDAs). As part of that agreement, TxDOT\n\n\n       11\n          That agreement explains that TxDOT entered into the CDA with Cintra-Zachry, LP and\nthat the CDA contemplated that Cintra-Zachry or one of its affiliates (i.e., SH 130 Concession\nCompany) may enter into agreements for development of one or more transportation facilities,\nincluding SH 130 Segments 5 and 6. Central Texas’s project-controls manager explained at trial\nthat his employer was actually Zachry Construction Corporation because Central Texas was a\nspecial-purpose entity created by Zachry Construction Corporation for the purpose of designing and\nconstructing the SH 130 Segments 5 and 6.\n\n                                                  31\n\frequired SH 130 Concession Company to obtain payment and performance bonds. SH 130\n\nConcession Company, as developer on the project, then entered into an agreement with Central\n\nTexas for Central Texas to design and build the SH 130 Segments 5 and 6. Central Texas, in turn,\n\nentered into subcontracts with various subcontractors and suppliers, including Star. Central Texas\n\ncontractually required Star to obtain its own payment and performance bonds. Given the complex\n\nstructure of the CDA and its chain of contracts under which each subcontractor is contractually\n\nrequired to obtain its own payment bonds, essentially stepping into the shoes of a prime contractor\n\nvis-à-vis its lower-tier subcontractor, Dig Tech’s notice to Central Texas, Star, and Great American\n\ncomports with the overarching purpose of the McGregor Act.\n\n               The Act also requires a payment-bond beneficiary to give notice to the prime\n\ncontractor of both unpaid claims and the amount of any retainage applicable to the account that has\n\nnot become due under the terms of the agreement between the prime contractor or a subcontractor\n\nand the payment-bond beneficiary. Id. § 2253.041(a), (d). The purpose of these notice requirements\n\nis “to protect the prime contractor from incurring double liability,” which could happen in the past\n\nbefore the legislature added the notice provisions to the statute, if a contractor paid a subcontractor\n\nin full and then later found a claim presented against it from someone who dealt only with the\n\nsubcontractor. Spaw-Glass Corp., 877 S.W.2d at 540. In this particular case, the record indicates\n\nthat SH 130 Concession was the party who had a contract with the governmental entity (i.e., the\n\n“prime contractor” as defined by the Act), but that SH 130 Concession bore no risk of liability to Dig\n\nTech, much less a risk of double liability. Under the terms of the bond, Star and Great American\n\nbound themselves to Central Texas as obligee “for the use and benefit of Claimants” in the amount\n\nof $3.1 million for payment for labor and material required for the performance of Star’s subcontract\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fwith Central Texas. Both Star, as principal, and Great American, as surety, received actual notice\n\nof Dig Tech’s claim. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.73 (allowing payment-bond beneficiary to “sue\n\nthe principal or surety, jointly or severally on the payment bond” for unpaid claim); Dealers Elec.\n\nSupply Co., 292 S.W.3d at 660 (holding that McGregor Act provides “mandatory and exclusive\n\nremedy against a surety and obligor on a public-work payment bond” issued under the Act). On this\n\nrecord, we must give the statute “the most comprehensive and liberal construction possible” to\n\naccomplish the remedial purpose of the Act.12 See Dealers Elec. Supply Co., 292 S.W.3d at 659\n\n(holding McGregor Act’s overarching purpose is “to protect unpaid laborers and materialmen by\n\nproviding them an additional funding source—a payment bond—in the event the prime contractor\n\nfails to meet its obligations”); Featherlite, 714 S.W.2d at 69. Under the circumstances presented\n\n\n\n       12\n            Although no party has raised this issue, it is questionable whether the McGregor Act\nshould apply to the contractually required bond at issue in this case. The only payment bond\nrequired under the Act is one that a governmental entity requires a prime contractor to execute to the\ngovernmental entity before beginning the work. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.021; see also Johnson\nServ. Co. v. Cinbar Eng’g Co., 409 S.W.2d 471, 473 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1966, no writ)\n(holding that subcontractor’s bond to subcontractor was not required under McGregor Act because\n“[i]f the bond in suit is not a bond required by any statute, it is not a statutory bond; it is a\ncommon law bond” (citing Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co. of New York v. Texas Sand & Gravel Co.,\n68 S.W.2d 551, 552 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1934, writ dism’d)). While the McGregor Act is a\nsubcontractor or supplier’s “mandatory and exclusive remedy against a surety and obligor on a\npublic-work payment bond” issued under the Act, “that exclusivity does not extend beyond suit\nagainst the [McGregor Act] bond itself” to preclude other statutory or common-law remedies.\nDealers Elec. Supply Co. v. Scroggins Constr. Co., 292 S.W.3d 650, 659-60 (Tex. 2009). As stated,\nthe parties proceeded at trial and on appeal as if the McGregor Act must apply if the Miller Act does\nnot and have not raised the issue of the Act’s applicability. The bond itself contains no specific\nnotice requirements, meaning that if the McGregor Act does not apply, Dig Tech was not required\nto provide notice of its claim at any particular time or in any particular form before suit. See Johnson\nServ. Co., 409 S.W.2d at 474 (holding that because McGregor Act did not apply, claimant’s case\nagainst surety must be determined only by bond’s terms, not any McGregor Act provisions). As a\nresult, whether we analyze Dig Tech’s claim against the bond under the McGregor Act or as a\ncommon-law contractual obligation, we conclude the trial court did not err by determining that Dig\nTech perfected its bond claim against Great American.\n\n                                                  33\n\fhere, Dig Tech’s deviation from the Act’s requirement to provide the prime contractor with notice\n\nhas not seriously hindered the legislature’s purpose because Star as principal and Great American\n\nas surety on the bond both had actual notice of true and accurate information about the amount of\n\nthe claim before suit was filed against them.13 See Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.073 (allowing\n\npayment-bond beneficiary to “sue the principal or surety, jointly or severally, on the payment bond”);\n\nStratton, 8 S.W.3d at 31. Based on the specific facts before us, this actual notice to the parties who\n\nwere liable on the bond constitutes substantial compliance. See also Dudley Constr., Ltd.,\n\n___ S.W.3d ___, 2016 WL 3917211, at *9. Releasing Great American from its liability on the bond\n\nbecause SH 130 Concession—who was not a party to the bond and who has no potential liability\n\nrelated to the bond—did not receive notice (and does not complain of its lack of notice) of the bond\n\nclaim would be contrary to the purpose of the statutory scheme and create an absurd result. See FKM\n\nP’ship, Ltd. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Hous. Sys., 255 S.W.3d 619, 633 (Tex. 2008) (“We use\n\ndefinitions prescribed by the Legislature . . . but otherwise, we construe the statute’s words according\n\nto their plain and common meaning unless a contrary intention is apparent from the context, or\n\nunless such a construction leads to absurd results.”).\n\n               Having determined that Dig Tech’s actual notice to Central Texas, Star, and Great\n\nAmerican substantially complies with the McGregor’s Act notice requirements, we conclude that\n\n\n\n       13\n          Star and Great American also allude to the fact that Dig Tech only references one of Star’s\nsubcontracts and bonds in its May 1 letter, implying that therefore Great American had insufficient\nnotice that both subcontracts and bonds were at issue. We note that before sending its notice, Dig\nTech requested that Star send it a copy of Star’s contract with Central Texas and its bond. Dig\nTech’s vice-president Mike Furry testified that Star’s president never sent him the contract. It is\nunclear from the record how Dig Tech eventually obtained any information about Star’s contracts\nand bonds, but this information was in Star’s possession, not Dig Tech’s. This is the sort of\ntechnical trap that the McGregor Act aims to prevent.\n\n                                                  34\n\fthe trial court did not err by ruling that Dig Tech perfected its claim against the bond. Therefore, the\n\ntrial court did not err by denying Great American’s motion for directed verdict and defendants’\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or by refusing to submit Great American’s\n\nproposed jury questions on Dig Tech’s substantial compliance with the McGregor Act’s notice\n\nrequirements. We overrule Star and Great American’s issues nine through eleven.\n\n\nApplication of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 18.091\n\n                 In their twelfth issue, Star and Great American assert that the trial court erred in\n\nawarding damages to Dig Tech without any evidence of Dig Tech’s actual damages presented in the\n\nform of a net loss after reduction for income-tax payments or unpaid income-tax liability, which\n\nthey contend is required by Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 18.091. Section\n\n18.091 states:\n\n\n        § 18.091. Proof of Certain Losses; Jury Instruction\n\n        (a)      Notwithstanding any other law, if any claimant seeks recovery for loss of\n                 earnings, loss of earning capacity, loss of contributions of a pecuniary value,\n                 or loss of inheritance, evidence to prove the loss must be presented in the\n                 form of a net loss after reduction for income tax payments or unpaid tax\n                 liability pursuant to any federal income tax law.\n\n        (b)      If any claimant seeks recovery for loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity,\n                 loss of contributions of a pecuniary value, or loss of inheritance, the court\n                 shall instruct the jury as to whether any recovery for compensatory damages\n                 sought by the claimant is subject to federal or state income taxes.\n\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 18.091. Star and Great American’s argument focuses on the “loss\n\nof earnings” category in Subsection (a) and they make no assertion that the other three categories\n\nwould be applicable to this case. Star and Great American reason that since Dig Tech’s invoices\n\n\n                                                   35\n\fwould result in ordinary revenue, they constitute “earnings” within the meaning of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code and federal income tax would be duly owed by Dig Tech. Consequently, Star and\n\nGreat American assert that Dig Tech’s failure to present net-of-taxes evidence precludes its recovery\n\nat trial.\n\n               In support of their assertion that Section 18.091 requires Dig Tech to prove\n\nnet-of-taxes damages in this case, Star and Great American rely on Interconex, Inc. v. Ugarov,\n\n224 S.W.3d 523 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) and Big Bird Tree Service\n\nv. Gallegos, 365 S.W.3d 173, 179 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied). As a preliminary matter,\n\nneither of those cases stand for the specific proposition advanced by Star and Great American. In\n\nInterconex, there was a jury trial on the sole issue of damages, following a default judgment on\n\nliability claims of breach of contract, negligence, and defamation. 224 S.W.3d at 527-28. The only\n\nelements of damages submitted to the jury were past and future lost earnings. Id. at 530. On appeal,\n\nInterconex asserted that the plaintiff failed to comply with the net-of-taxes requirement of Section\n\n18.091, but the court found that such issue was waived and therefore it did not address the\n\nnet-of-taxes requirement, nor did it expressly or tacitly approve the application of Section 18.091\n\nin a breach-of-contract case. Id. at 532-33.\n\n               In Gallegos, an employee brought a negligence action against his employer, seeking\n\ndamages for lost earning capacity resulting from an on-the-job injury. 365 S.W.3d at 175. The\n\nemployee testified to pre-tax wages without objection and the court’s ultimate analysis came down\n\nto the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s award of lost earning capacity in the past and\n\nin the future. Id. at 178-79. The case specifically involved damages resulting from a personal injury\n\n\n\n\n                                                  36\n\fand there was no discussion of the application of Section 18.091 to other types of damages such as\n\ncontract damages.\n\n                In their briefing, the parties advance differing views of whether Section 18.091\n\napplies to this type of case. A review of the pleadings, evidence, charge, and judgment in this case\n\nindicates that this is a breach-of-contract case as opposed to a case involving damages resulting from\n\na personal injury rendering a party unable to work.14 Star and Great American argue that the\n\nlanguage of Section 18.091 is broad and is not expressly limited to personal-injury cases. Dig Tech\n\ncounters that Section 18.091 applies only to personal-injury cases, not contract cases, because\n\ndamages received in a breach-of-contract case are taxable, and application of the section would\n\neffectively result in double taxation on such contract plaintiffs.\n\n                Our inquiry starts with the language of the statute. Both Subsection (a) and (b)\n\ncontain the phrase “if any claimant seeks recovery for . . .” preceding the types of losses that must\n\nbe presented in the form of net of taxes. This language expressly points the analysis to the type of\n\ndamages sought to be recovered, rather than the type of liability claims (contract or personal injury)\n\nin question. The liability claims are still relevant, however, because different liability claims result\n\nin different types of damages. Here, Dig Tech sought recovery of breach-of-contract damages from\n\nStar based on the amount of the unpaid invoices in question. After the evidence closed, the jury was\n\ncharged with fairly standard breach-of-contract jury questions asking whether Dig Tech and Star had\n\nan agreement, whether Star failed to comply with the agreement, and whether Star’s failure to\n\ncomply was excused by Dig Tech’s failure to comply with a material obligation of the same\n\n\n       14\n          Dig Tech also requested and received quantum meruit questions included in the charge\nbut because the jury answered “Yes” to Question 1 (existence of a contract), the jury was instructed\nnot to answer those questions.\n\n                                                  37\n\fagreement. Ultimately, the jury was asked the damages question conditioned on a finding of Star’s\n\nfailure to comply. Question 4 of the charge (the damages question) reads as follows:\n\n\n                                             Question 4\n\n                What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably\n       compensate Dig Tech for its damages, if any, that resulted from Star Operations’\n       failure to comply?\n\n               Consider the following elements of damages, if any, and none other.\n\n               The reasonable value of the work performed by Dig Tech at the time and\n               place it was performed.\n\n               Answer in Dollars and Cents, if any.\n\n               Answer: _______________\n\n\nDig Tech did not seek recovery of “loss of earnings” as that phrase is typically used in the Texas\n\nPattern Jury Charge and Texas case law, nor was the jury charged to assess such an element of\n\ndamages. The cases on loss of earnings tend to center on the burden of proof and distinguishing loss\n\nof earnings from loss-of-earning capacity. See Strauss v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 67 S.W.3d 428,\n\n435-43 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.). However, the parties have cited no cases,\n\nand we have found none, that allow a corporation such as Dig Tech to recover loss of earnings as a\n\nmeasure of damages following the breach of an agreement. The cases in which this measure of\n\ndamages is sought to be recovered are generally personal-injury cases. The Internal Revenue Code\n\nauthorizes compensation received on account of personal injuries or sickness to be excluded from\n\ngross income. 26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(2). “Presumably, the purpose of [Section 18.091] is to prevent\n\na plaintiff from obtaining a windfall by being awarded pretax income on awards that are not subject\n\nto taxation.” Gallegos, 365 S.W.3d at 179.\n\n                                                38\n\f                In contrast, a corporation such as Dig Tech would be required to report\n\nbreach-of-contract damages from a court award as ordinary income. Internal Revenue Service,\n\nU.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, Pub. No. 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income: For Use in Preparing\n\n2016 Returns 29 (2017), https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p525.pdf. Furthermore, Dig Tech did not\n\nseek recovery of loss of earnings, and the evidence did not demonstrate that it lost earnings or\n\nsuffered a loss of the opportunity or ability to obtain earnings. Instead, Dig Tech failed to receive\n\nits benefit of the bargain—payment—after it had performed the work. Based on the facts of the\n\nbusiness dispute presented by this case, Star and Great American’s assertion would require us to\n\nstretch the interpretation of Section 18.091 to fit a category of damages to which it seemingly was\n\nnot intended to apply and in which there is no discernable potential for a plaintiff to obtain a windfall\n\nof tax-free damages. We decline to do so. Accordingly, we overrule Star and Great American’s\n\nissue twelve.\n\n\nDig Tech’s attorneys’ fees award\n\n                In their thirteenth issue, Star and Great American assert that the trial court erred in\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees to Dig Tech because Dig Tech failed to segregate recoverable attorneys’\n\nfees from unrecoverable attorneys’ fees. In support of this argument, Star and Great American cite\n\nTony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299 (Tex. 2006). However, we need not address\n\nthis issue. Star and Great American offered no objection to the attorneys’ fees question—Question\n\nNo. 9—during the charge conference. Consequently, Star and Great American did not specifically\n\nobject to the attorneys’ fees question on the ground that it failed to segregate recoverable fees from\n\nunrecoverable fees. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 272, 274. Accordingly, Star and Great American failed to\n\npreserve error on this issue. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; see Young v. Neatherlin, 102 S.W.3d 415, 420\n\n                                                   39\n\f(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (“[T]he Texas Supreme Court has held that error\n\nis preserved by an objection to the jury charge on the ground that the charge did not properly\n\nsegregate attorney’s fees.” (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991)).\n\n\nTaxable costs\n\n                In their fourteenth and final issue, Star and Great American assert that the trial court\n\nerred in awarding Dig Tech costs for copies of deposition transcripts as “taxable costs” when Dig\n\nTech did not notice or initiate the depositions in question. Whether a particular expense is\n\nrecoverable under a statute or rule as court costs is a question of law, which we review de novo.\n\nGumpert v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 312 S.W.3d 237, 239 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.). The\n\nallocation of costs is a matter for the trial court’s discretion and cannot be overturned on appeal\n\nabsent an abuse of discretion. Id. at 239.\n\n                Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 31.007 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n        (b)     A judge of any court may include in any order or judgment all costs,\n                including the following:\n\n                (1)     fees of the clerk and service fees due the county;\n\n                (2)     fees of the court reporter for the original of stenographic transcripts\n                        necessarily obtained for use in the suit;\n\n                (3)     masters, interpreters, and guardians ad litem appointed pursuant to\n                        these rules and state statutes; and\n\n                (4)     such other costs and fees as may be permitted by these rules and state\nstatutes.\n\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 31.007(b). Relevant here is Subsection (b)(2), which allows the\n\n“fees of the court reporter for the original of stenographic transcripts necessarily obtained for use in\n\n                                                  40\n\fthe suit” to be included as costs awarded in the judgment. The dispute here focuses not on whether\n\nthe seven deposition transcripts in question were necessarily obtained for use in the suit but on\n\nwhether Dig Tech could recover costs for obtaining copies of those deposition transcripts when it\n\ndid not notice or initiate the depositions, and thus it was only paying for the copies, as opposed to\n\npaying the court reporter’s fee for the original transcript. Section 31.007(b)(2) specifically allows\n\nrecovery of the court reporter’s fee for the original stenographic transcript as a taxable court cost.\n\nWe agree with the reasoning of our sister court in Gumpert. In that case, the court concluded that\n\nSection 31.007(b) specifically limits recovery of costs to the fees of the court reporter for the original\n\nof stenographic transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the suit and that because no other statute\n\nor rule authorizes the recovery of costs to obtain copies of deposition transcripts, it was error to\n\naward such costs. Id. at 241-42; see also Waste Mgmt. of Tex., Inc. v. Texas Disposal Sys. Landfill,\n\nInc., No. 03-10-00826-CV, 2014 WL 6705741, at *4 (Tex. App.—Austin Nov. 14, 2014, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.) (following Gumpert and holding that costs for video depositions or copies of depositions\n\nor transcripts are not recoverable as court costs).\n\n                Similarly in this case, we conclude it was error for the trial court to award the costs\n\nof obtaining copies of deposition transcripts, and we sustain Star and Great American’s fourteenth\n\nissue. Accordingly, we will reverse that portion of the trial court’s judgment relating to court costs\n\nand remand this cause for further proceedings to allow the trial court the opportunity to recalculate\n\nthe taxable costs.\n\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n                We reverse that portion of the trial court’s judgment relating to court costs for\n\nobtaining copies of deposition transcripts, and we remand the case to the trial court for further\n\n                                                   41\n\fproceedings consistent with this opinion.

BLOMERTH, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n                This appeal arises out of a lower-tier subcontract related to a highway-construction\n\nproject. Appellant Star Operations, Inc. was hired as a subcontractor by Central Texas Highway\n\nConstructors, the design-build contractor for the project, to build infrastructure for the illumination,\n\nsignal, intelligent-transportation, and toll-collection systems as part of the construction of SH 130\n\ntoll-road Segments 5 and 6 southeast of Austin. Appellee Dig Tech, Inc. sued Star and its\n\npayment-bond surety, appellant Great American Insurance Company of New York, asserting that\n\nStar had breached an oral contract with Dig Tech. Dig Tech alleged that Star had hired it to perform\n\nsome of the hole-boring work for the installation of electrical conduit needed for Star to complete\n\nits part of the construction project and that Star did not pay Dig Tech for the work it did. After a jury\n\ntrial, the jury found in Dig Tech’s favor and awarded Dig Tech the amount of its unpaid invoices,\n\n$228,524, and attorneys’ fees. On appeal, Star and Great American Insurance raise fourteen issues\n\fchallenging the judgment. For the reasons explained below, we will affirm the judgment in part, and\n\nwe will reverse in part on the issue of court costs and remand the cause for further proceedings on\n\nthat issue.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) entered into a facility concession\n\nagreement (FCA) with SH 130 Concession Company, the developer, for SH 130 Concession to\n\nfinance and perform the construction of SH 130 toll-road Segments 5 and 6 southeast of Austin and\n\nto grant SH 130 Concession the concession to lease the sections and toll them for 50 years after the\n\nproject’s completion.1 See generally Tex. Transp. Code §§ 223.201-.209 (authorizing TxDOT to\n\nenter into public-private partnership agreements to facilitate private-sector investment and\n\nparticipation in development of state’s transportation system). SH 130 Concession hired Central\n\n\n\n\n        1\n           Star asserts that “it was undisputed and uncontroverted that the Project involved the use\nof federal funds.” We note that the record citations provided by Star include a citation to the section\nof TxDOT’s agreement with SH 130 Concession that states “[r]egardless of whether federal credit\nor funds are made available to Facility, Developer shall comply and require its Contractors to\ncomply with all federal requirements applicable to transportation projects that receive federal credit\nor funds, including those set forth in Exhibit 8.” (Emphasis added.) The remainder of its record\ncitations in support of this point are to Attachment 1 to Exhibit 8, which was attached to each of the\nparties’ individual subcontracts with Central Texas. That portion of the form attachment states:\n“The work herein proposed will be financed in whole or in part with Federal funds, and therefore\nall of the statutes, rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Government and applicable to\nwork financed in whole or in part with Federal funds will apply to such work.” No party has pointed\nus to any evidence in the record of the federal government’s participation in or funding of the project\noutside of these record citations. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume that the project\nreceived some unknown amount of federal funding because Dig Tech does not challenge\nStar’s assertion.\n\n                                                  2\n\fTexas Highway Constructors as the design-build contractor on the project. As previously mentioned,\n\nCentral Texas in turn hired Star as a subcontractor to build infrastructure for the illumination, signal,\n\nintelligent-transportation, and toll-collection systems. Star and Central Texas entered into two\n\nsubcontracting agreements related to this work. As part of those agreements, Central Texas required\n\nStar to furnish a performance bond and a payment bond for each subcontract. Star’s surety on the\n\nbonds is Great American. The payment bond at issue here provides that “Star Operations, Inc., as\n\nprincipal, . . . and Great American Insurance Company of New York, . . . as surety, . . . are held and\n\nfirmly bound unto CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTORS LLC as Obligee . . . for the\n\nuse and benefit of Claimants as herein below defined in the amount of . . . $3,100,000.00 for the\n\npayment whereof Principal and Surety bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators,\n\nsuccessors and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.”2 Central Texas also\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           There is no dispute that Dig Tech is a “claimant” as that term is defined in the bond. In\ntheir arguments about notice of the bond claim, however, Star and Great American allude to the fact\nthat Dig Tech’s May 1 notice letter only references one of the payment bonds and one of Star’s\nsubcontracts with Central Texas. When Dig Tech had not received payment from Star by late April,\non April 23, 2012, Dig Tech’s vice-president and owner Mike Furry requested “a copy of the\ncontract” between Star and Central Texas and “a copy of your payment bond” from Lana Lewis, the\npresident and founder of Star. Furry testified that he never received a copy of the contract from\nLewis. Later correspondence among the various entities involved in the projects refers to both\ncontracts and both bonds. The bond attached to the May 1 notice letter was admitted into evidence\nat trial. The judgment states that Great American “is obligated under the terms of its bond to make\nthe payments that Star Operations failed to make,” but does not specify the bond number. Star does\nnot assert on appeal that the work performed by Dig Tech related only to one or the other of its\nsubcontracts or that funds to pay the judgment are lacking under either bond. Because we have not\nbeen asked to determine whether both bonds applied to Dig Tech’s work or whether the trial court’s\naward refers to one or both bonds, we express no opinion and make no determination about whether\nthe judgment applies to one or both bonds. For simplicity’s sake, throughout this opinion, we will\nrefer to the “bond,” not the “bonds.”\n\n                                                   3\n\fseparately hired Dig Tech as a subcontractor responsible for relocating and adjusting\n\nelectric-distribution facilities owned by Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative. The contract at issue in\n\nthis case is an oral lower-tier subcontract that Star later entered into with Dig Tech for some\n\nhole-boring work for the installation of electrical conduit that Star needed done to complete its part\n\nof the construction project.3\n\n               Dig Tech completed the requested work and sought payment for it from Star. Dig\n\nTech sent Star a letter on March 13, 2012, requesting payment for the invoices that had been\n\nsubmitted before that time and copied Central Texas on the letter. After inquiry from Central Texas\n\nto Star on Friday, March 16, Star informed Central Texas that the invoices were set up to be paid the\n\nfollowing Tuesday. On April 12, Central Texas’s project-controls manager, Michael Kiehnau,\n\nemailed Star’s president and founder, Lana Lewis, to inform her that Dig Tech’s vice-president and\n\nowner, Mike Furry, had called Kiehnau to let him know that Star had not contacted Dig Tech about\n\npayment, and consequently, Dig Tech would be filing a bond claim. Kiehnau told Lewis, “I urge you\n\nto resolve this issue immediately.” On April 23, Furry requested that Lewis send him “a copy of the\n\ncontract between Star [O]perations and [Central Texas]. Also, I would like you to provide me with\n\na copy of your payment bond.” Furry testified that he never received a copy of the contract from\n\nLewis. On May 1, 2012, Dig Tech notified Star, Central Texas, and Great American of Dig Tech’s\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Although Star refers to this contract in its briefing as the “purported oral contract,” Star\ndoes not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict that “Dig Tech and\nStar Operations agree[d] that Dig Tech would conduct boring work for Star Operations, and that Star\nOperations would pay Dig Tech for such boring work.”\n\n                                                  4\n\fclaim via certified mail, return receipt requested, and further notified them that if all invoices were\n\nnot paid in full, Dig Tech would file suit on the bond “on the 91st day after April 4, 2012, the last\n\nday on which Dig Tech’s work or labor was done or performed.”4 Dig Tech subsequently filed suit\n\nagainst Star and Great American, alleging claims for breach of contract (express or implied),\n\nquantum meruit, and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                After a ten-day trial, the jury found that Dig Tech and Star Operations had an\n\nagreement that Dig Tech would perform hole-boring work for Star and Star would pay for that work,\n\nbut Star failed to comply with its agreement to pay and its failure to comply was unexcused.5 The\n\njury also found that although Dig Tech intentionally interfered with Star’s subcontract with\n\ndesign-build contractor Central Texas, Dig Tech did so only because it had a good-faith belief that\n\nit had a right to threaten garnishment for the work it performed and any harm to Star did not result\n\nfrom any malice on the part of Dig Tech. The jury further found that Star, but not Dig Tech, had\n\n“unclean hands.”\n\n                The jury awarded Dig Tech $228,524 for its unpaid work and also awarded attorneys’\n\nfees. The final judgment included an award of court costs, “including the cost of deposition\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           The bond states: “Principal [Star] and Surety [Great American] hereby jointly and\nseverally agree with the Obligee [Central Texas] that every Claimant as herein defined, who has not\nbeen paid in full before the expiration of a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which the last\nof such Claimant’s work or labor was done or performed, or materials were furnished by such\nClaimant, may sue on this bond for the use of such Claimant, prosecute the suit to final judgment\nof such sum or sums as may be justly due Claimant, and have execution thereon. The Obligee\n[Central Texas] shall not be liable for payment of any costs or expenses of any such suit.”\n        5\n         The evidence at trial included e-mails stating a quote and proposed terms, start date, and\nprojected duration of work, as well as evidence that the work was completed and accepted by Star.\n\n                                                   5\n\ftranscripts and subpoenas necessarily obtained for use in this suit,” pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 131. The trial court also ordered in the judgment that “Dig Tech substantially complied\n\nwith the notice provisions of the McGregor Act in order to perfect its bond claim against Great\n\nAmerican Insurance,” and accordingly, Great American “is obligated under the terms of its bond to\n\nmake the payments that Star Operations failed to make.” Star and Great American appeal from\n\nthe judgment.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                Star and Great American challenge the judgment in fourteen issues. Seven issues\n\nflow from their contention that the trial court should have applied federal law to Dig Tech’s contract\n\nclaim. Issues eight through eleven concern the law related to Dig Tech’s claim against the Great\n\nAmerican payment bond and whether Dig Tech perfected its claim against the bond. In their twelfth\n\nissue, Star and Great American contend that the trial court erred by awarding damages to Dig Tech\n\nwithout any evidence of Dig Tech’s actual damages as net loss after reduction of income-tax\n\npayments or unpaid income-tax liability, which they assert is required by Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 18.091. In issue thirteen, they challenge the trial court’s award of attorneys’\n\nfees to Dig Tech based on their contention that Dig Tech failed to segregate recoverable attorneys’\n\nfees from unrecoverable attorneys’ fees. In issue fourteen, Star and Great American argue that the\n\ntrial court erred by awarding Dig Tech costs for copies of deposition transcripts as “taxable costs”\n\nwhen Dig Tech did not notice or initiate the depositions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fApplication of the Christian doctrine\n\n               The first seven issues are related to Star and Great American’s contention that the trial\n\ncourt should have applied a federal-law principle, the Christian doctrine, to Dig Tech’s contract\n\nclaim because the highway project was federally funded. Star and Great American assert that the\n\nChristian case stands for the proposition that when the subject matter of a contract is governed by\n\nvalid federal regulations, the regulations are incorporated into the contract as a matter of law, even\n\nif the parties had not agreed to be bound by them.

They contend that federal law required Dig\n\nTech to obtain a written contract with Star and to obtain approval from TxDOT for the oral contract\n\nwith Star as conditions precedent to formation of an enforceable contract. They further contend that\n\nfederal law required Dig Tech to provide statutorily compliant certified payrolls as a condition\n\nprecedent to any liability arising from Star’s failure to pay Dig Tech, and that the payrolls provided\n\nby Dig Tech were not statutorily compliant based on errors in the classification or pay rate of\n\napproximately four employees in a one-week period. Therefore, they argue that the trial court erred\n\nby refusing to submit jury questions on (1) Dig Tech’s alleged failure to obtain a written contract\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fwith Star, (2) Dig Tech’s alleged failure to obtain approval from TxDOT for the purported oral\n\ncontract with Star, and (3) Dig Tech’s alleged failure to provide statutorily compliant certified\n\npayrolls. They also argue that the trial court erred in awarding contract damages to Dig Tech based\n\non their contention that Dig Tech’s failure to satisfy these three conditions precedent renders the oral\n\nagreement that Dig Tech sued upon unenforceable by law. We first consider the effect of the\n\nChristian doctrine on Dig Tech’s contract claim.\n\n                Under the Christian doctrine, which has been developed in a line of decisions from\n\nthe Federal Circuit, “a mandatory contract clause that expresses a significant or deeply ingrained\n\nstrand of public procurement policy is considered to be included in a contract by operation of law.”\n\nS.J.

The Christian doctrine does not allow all mandatory\n\ncontract clauses to be automatically incorporated by operation of law into a contract. Id. The\n\ndoctrine is limited to those mandatory clauses expressing significant public procurement policy and\n\nto “less fundamental or significant mandatory procurement contract clauses if not written to benefit\n\nor protect the party seeking incorporation.” Id. at 779-80.\n\n               Star and Great American contend that the Christian doctrine should be applied to\n\nincorporate into the alleged oral agreement between Star and Dig Tech all applicable federal\n\nregulations, but most specifically those regulations requiring (1) prior written consent of TxDOT to\n\nany subcontract, (2) a written contract between Star and Dig Tech, and (3) Dig Tech’s provision of\n\nstatutorily compliant certified payroll. See 23 C.F.R. § 635.116(b) (subcontractor and contractor\n\nresponsibilities related to federally funded highway projects); 29 C.F.R. §§ 3.1-.11 (wage regulations\n\nfor contractors and subcontractors on public building or work financed with federal funds). Star and\n\nGreat American have not argued that these regulations “express a significant or deeply ingrained\n\nstrand of public procurement policy.” See General Eng’g & Mach. Works, 991 F.2d at 779. More\n\nimportantly, however, none of the regulations that Star and Great American want to incorporate in\n\nthe Dig Tech contract prescribe mandatory contract clauses like those incorporated into contracts\n\nunder the Christian doctrine. See, e.g., Amoroso, 12 F.3d at 1075 (applying Christian doctrine to\n\nconstruction contract to substitute mandatory clause of Buy American Act applicable to construction\n\ncontracts by operation of law when contract had incorrectly included clause for nonappropriated fund\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fsupply contracts); Christian, 312 F.2d at 424 (incorporating standard termination clause that\n\nregulation required to “be inserted in all fixed-price construction contracts amounting to more\n\nthan $1,000”).\n\n                 Section 635.116 of Title 23 establishes requirements for entering into a subcontract\n\non a federally funded highway project, but the regulation does not mandate that any specific clause\n\nbe incorporated into the contract:\n\n\n       The [state transportation department] shall not permit any of the contract work to be\n       performed under a subcontract, unless such arrangement has been authorized by the\n       [state transportation department] in writing. Prior to authorizing a subcontract, the\n       [state transportation department] shall assure that each subcontract is evidenced in\n       writing and that it contains all pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime\n       contract. The Division Administrator [chief federal highway administration official\n       for the particular state] may permit the [state transportation department] to satisfy the\n       subcontract assurance requirements by concurrence in a [state transportation\n       department] process which requires the contractor to certify that each subcontract\n       arrangement will be in the form of a written agreement containing all the\n       requirements and pertinent provisions of the prime contract. Prior to the Division\n       Administrator’s concurrence, the [state transportation department] must demonstrate\n       that it has an acceptable plan for monitoring such certifications.\n\n\n23 C.F.R. § 635.116(b). Similarly, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Title 29 require contractors and\n\nsubcontractors engaged in construction of any federally funded public work to furnish weekly wage\n\nstatements to the federal or state agency contracting for or financing the work and to keep payroll\n\nrecords reflecting the correct classification, rate of pay, hours worked, etc., for each worker, but\n\nthose sections do not mandate the inclusion of any specific clause into the contract or subcontract\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fgoverning the work.6 See generally 29 C.F.R. §§ 3.1-3.10 (prescribing anti-kickback regulations\n\nunder Copeland Act and regulations intended to aid in enforcement of minimum-wage\n\nrequirements); see also id. § 3.11 (requiring federally funded public-work contracts to expressly bind\n\ncontractors or subcontractors to comply with applicable regulations, but not mandating inclusion of\n\nspecific clause). Star and Great American seek to broaden the reach of the Christian doctrine,\n\narguing not only that under the doctrine all applicable federal regulations should be incorporated into\n\nthe subcontract between Dig Tech and Star, but also that those incorporated regulations should be\n\nread as implied conditions precedent to the formation or performance of the oral subcontract. We\n\ndecline to extend the reach of the Christian doctrine in this manner. Based on this record, we\n\nconclude that the regulations relied upon by Star and Great American do not require the\n\nincorporation of any mandatory contract clauses under the Christian doctrine into the oral\n\nsubcontract between Dig Tech and Star.\n\n               Star and Great American also argue, however, that the federal requirements were\n\nexpressly incorporated into any and all contracts on the highway project, and thus would be\n\nincorporated into any subcontract between Dig Tech and Star. While Star and Great American are\n\ncorrect that the federal requirements were expressly incorporated into Central Texas’s subcontracts\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Evidence was admitted at trial that Dig Tech submitted certified payroll records to Star for\nthe twenty-six-week period that Dig Tech performed work for Star on the project. Star points to\nevidence in the record that four individuals were either misclassified or paid the wrong amount of\nhourly pay for their classification or both for at least one week that they worked and an instance in\nwhich two employees were listed incorrectly as being paid straight time when they had worked\novertime in one week. Dig Tech responds by pointing to evidence in the record that Star never\nreviewed the certified payrolls that were submitted or notified Dig Tech of any compliance issues\nso that Dig Tech could correct them until after Dig Tech filed suit against Star.\n\n                                                  11\n\fwith Star and with Dig Tech, as required by the FCA (the contract between TxDOT and SH 130\n\nConcession Company),7 the FCA also explicitly provides that those provisions “shall not be\n\nincorporated by reference in any case” in any lower-tier subcontracts.\n\n               “FCA Exhibit 8—Federal Requirements” is an attachment to Star’s subcontracts with\n\nCentral Texas and to Dig Tech’s contract with Central Texas, and its Attachment 2 (titled “Required\n\nContract Provisions Federal-Aid Construction Contracts”) contains the following general provision:\n\n\n       Except as otherwise provided for in each section, the contractor [Central Texas]\n       shall insert in each subcontract all of the stipulations contained in these Required\n       Contract Provisions, and further require their inclusion in any lower tier subcontract\n       or purchase order that may in turn be made. The Required Contract Provisions shall\n       not be incorporated by reference in any case. The prime contractor [Central Texas]\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           The FCA provides:\n\n       Developer [SH 130 Concession Company] shall comply and require its contractors\n       to comply with all federal requirements applicable to transportation projects that\n       receive federal credit or funds, including those set forth in Exhibit 8.\n\nIn FCA Section 10.2, concerning “Responsibility for Work, Contractors and Employees,” the FCA\nfurther provides that:\n\n       Each Contract shall include terms and conditions sufficient to ensure compliance by\n       the Contractor with the requirements of the FCA Documents, and shall include those\n       terms that are specifically required by the FCA Documents to be included therein\n       including, to the extent applicable, those set forth in Exhibit 8.\n\nStar’s subcontracts with Central Texas and Dig Tech’s subcontract with Central Texas expressly\nincorporate the entire FCA into those subcontracts:\n\n       Facility Concession Agreement (FCA) is the agreement between the Developer [SH\n       130 Concession Company] and the Texas Department of Transportation. The FCA\n       and related FCA documents are incorporated into this Subcontract Agreement.\n\n                                                12\n\f       shall be responsible for compliance by any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor\n       with these Required Contract provisions.8\n\n\n(Emphases added.) Attachment 2’s Section VII, “Subletting or Assigning the Contract,” includes\n\nthe following provision:\n\n\n       No portion of the contract shall be sublet, assigned or otherwise disposed of except\n       with the written consent of the SHA [state highway authority] contracting officer\n       [defined as TxDOT or its Authorized Representative], or authorized representative,\n       and such consent when given shall not be construed to relieve the contractor [defined\n       as Design-Build Contractor (Central Texas)] of any responsibility for the fulfillment\n       of the contract. Written consent will be given only after the [state highway authority]\n       has assured that each subcontract is evidenced in writing and that it contains all\n       pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime contract.\n\n\nIn Section V, “Statements and Payrolls,” Attachment 2 also incorporates by express reference the\n\nCopeland Act regulations found in 29 C.F.R. pt. 3 and includes the requirement of weekly\n\nsubmission of certified payroll statements, as provided in those regulations.\n\n               However, Star’s subcontracts with Central Texas also include the following provision\n\nconcerning lower-tier subcontracts:\n\n\n       9.4 SUBCONTRACTS. Seller [Star Operations] shall not subcontract any Work\n       . . . without the prior written consent of D&C Contractor [Central Texas], which\n       consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller [Star] shall be solely\n       responsible for the engagement and management of its Subcontractors in the\n       performance of the Work, for the performance of Work by its Subcontractors and for\n       all acts or omissions of Subcontractors. Seller shall insure that all Work furnished\n       or performed by Subcontractors conforms to the requirements of the Agreement\n       Documents. Neither the consent by D&C Contractor, nor anything contained herein,\n\n\n       8\n         Attachment 1 to Exhibit 8 establishes the following definitions for the required contract\nprovisions included in Exhibit 8: “‘contractor,’ ‘prime contractor,’ ‘bidder’ or ‘prospective\nprimary participant’ . . . shall be construed to mean the Design-Build Contractor or its\nauthorized representative.”\n\n                                                 13\n\f       shall create any contractual relationship between any lower tier Subcontractor and\n       D&C Contractor. All lower-tier subcontracts must contain the terms and conditions\n       that are incorporated in this Agreement.\n\n       No Subcontractor is intended to be or shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary\n       of the Agreement. Each agreement between Seller and any Subcontractor shall be\n       in writing, and shall be assignable to D&C Contractor upon the completion or\n       termination of the Work. A copy of each such agreement with pricing removed shall\n       be provided to D&C Contractor upon request.\n\n       . . . . The Seller agrees that it is fully responsible to the D&C Contractor for the acts\n       and omissions of its subcontractors . . . .\n\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n               Construing all of these provisions together, we conclude that the parties’ subcontracts\n\nwith Central Texas expressly contained the federal requirements that were included as terms of the\n\nFCA. But nothing in the record indicates that the parties intended to incorporate those requirements\n\ninto Star’s oral contract with Dig Tech, and we have concluded that the Christian doctrine does not\n\nrequire their wholesale incorporation into that contract. In fact, the federal requirements themselves\n\nstate that “[t]he Required Contract Provisions shall not be incorporated by reference in any case.”\n\nWe note that Section 9.4 of Star’s contract with Central Texas explicitly places responsibility on Star\n\nfor the engagement of any lower-tier subcontractors and the lower-tier subcontractor’s acts and\n\nomissions. To the extent that Star’s contract with Central Texas required any lower-tier subcontracts\n\nto be in writing and approved by TxDOT, it was the responsibility of Star, not the lower-tier\n\nsubcontractor engaged by Star, to ensure compliance. In this case, Star seeks to use its own\n\nnoncompliance with its subcontracts with Central Texas as a defense to enforcement of its oral\n\ncontract with Dig Tech.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f               In essence, Star seeks to use promises it made to perform in its contract with Central\n\nTexas to create conditions precedent in Star’s separate contract with Dig Tech. Conditions precedent\n\nare not favored in the law.

Star points to no evidence in the record, and we\n\nhave found no evidence, that indicates the parties intended the agreement between Star and Dig Tech\n\nto become binding only after it was memorialized in a written contract and approved by TxDOT.\n\nStar’s allegation that Dig Tech was required to submit statutorily compliant certified payroll to Star\n\nas a condition precedent to Star’s obligation to pay Dig Tech for its work is likewise not supported\n\nby the evidence in the record. Although Dig Tech submitted a certified payroll report to Star each\n\nweek during the period that it did work for Star, as required by federal regulations, there is no\n\nevidence of Star and Dig Tech communicating about making payment conditional on submission of\n\nstatutorily compliant payroll before Dig Tech began its work, and the parties’ actions afterward also\n\nsupport the conclusion that the parties had not agreed on such a condition. Star’s human-resources\n\nand payroll director testified that she did not do anything with Dig Tech’s certified payroll statements\n\nexcept electronically store them in a computer file; Star never forwarded the certified payroll\n\nstatements to Central Texas; Star’s president testified that she never reviewed the payroll statements\n\nbefore Dig Tech filed suit or discussed any classifications in the payroll statements with her\n\nemployees or Dig Tech; and Star’s president never told Dig Tech that one of the reasons Star refused\n\nto pay is because of any mistake or error in the payroll statements or provided Dig Tech with an\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fopportunity to correct the errors that Star asserts are in some of the certified payroll statements.\n\nFurthermore, Star’s president admitted that Star refused to pay Dig Tech before she had ever\n\nreviewed Dig Tech’s certified payroll statements. We conclude that the parties never agreed that\n\nthese three federal requirements should be conditions precedent to their agreement that Dig Tech\n\nwould perform hole-boring work for Star.\n\n               We overrule Star’s first seven issues. The trial court correctly concluded as a matter\n\nof law that the Christian doctrine did not require the incorporation of the three federal requirements\n\npropounded by Star into Star’s subcontract with Dig Tech. While those three requirements were\n\nexpress provisions of Star’s contracts with Central Texas and Dig Tech’s contracts with Central\n\nTexas, they were not incorporated into Star’s oral subcontract with Dig Tech. Star and Dig Tech did\n\nnot agree to make them conditions precedent to the formation or enforceability of Star’s subcontract\n\nwith Dig Tech. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to submit proposed jury questions\n\non the lack of a written contract, the lack of TxDOT approval of the oral contract, or Dig Tech’s\n\nalleged failure to provide statutorily compliant certified payroll statements. Likewise, because the\n\nthree federal requirements were not conditions precedent to the formation of an enforceable contract,\n\nthe trial court did not err by awarding Dig Tech contract damages.\n\n\nDig Tech’s claim against the Great American payment bond\n\n               In issues eight through eleven, Star and Great American challenge the trial court’s\n\napplication of the law to Dig Tech’s claim against the payment bond. Star and Great American\n\nassert that the federal Miller Act applies to the project, and therefore, federal courts have exclusive\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the bond dispute. Alternatively, if the Texas McGregor Act applies,\n\nStar and Great American assert that the evidence at trial showed that Dig Tech failed to comply with\n\n                                                  17\n\fthat Act’s notice requirements and thus failed to perfect its bond claim as a matter of law. Star and\n\nGreat American consequently challenge the trial court’s ruling as a matter of law that Dig Tech\n\nperfected its bond claim, the trial court’s denial of Great American’s motion for instructed verdict\n\nand of Star and Great American’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the trial\n\ncourt’s refusal to submit Great American’s proposed jury questions on whether Dig Tech\n\nsubstantially complied with the McGregor Act’s notice requirements.\n\n\nMiller Act v. McGregor Act\n\n               We first consider whether the Miller Act applies to Dig Tech’s bond claim.9 The\n\nMiller Act requires bonds to be issued as follows:\n\n\n       (b)     Type of bonds required.--Before any contract of more than $100,000 is\n               awarded for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or\n               public work of the Federal Government, a person must furnish to the\n               Government the following bonds, which become binding when the contract\n               is awarded:\n\n               (1)     Performance bond.--A performance bond with a surety satisfactory\n                       to the officer awarding the contract, and in an amount the officer\n                       considers adequate, for the protection of the Government.\n\n               (2)     Payment bond.--A payment bond with a surety satisfactory to the\n                       officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material\n                       in carrying out the work provided for in the contract for the use of\n                       each person. The amount of the payment bond shall equal the total\n                       amount payable by the terms of the contract unless the officer\n                       awarding the contract determines, in a writing supported by specific\n                       findings, that a payment bond in that amount is impractical, in which\n                       case the contracting officer shall set the amount of the payment bond.\n\n\n\n       9\n         Star and Great American raised this issue in a plea to the jurisdiction, in Great American’s\nmotion for directed verdict, and in Star and Great American’s motion for judgment notwithstanding\nthe verdict; none of these motions were granted.\n\n                                                 18\n\f                        The amount of the payment bond shall not be less than the amount of\n                        the performance bond.\n\n\n40 U.S.C. § 3131(b) (italics added). Article 7 of the contracts between Central Texas and Star\n\nrequired Star to provide both a performance bond and a payment bond each in an amount equal to\n\nthe full contract price on forms attached to the contracts. The bond at issue in this case is the\n\npayment bond issued by Star and Great American on behalf of Central Texas. The “Subcontract\n\nLabor and Material Payment Bond” that Star and Great American executed is a payment bond\n\nprovided for the use and benefit of claimants who furnish labor or materials required for use in the\n\nperformance of Star’s contract with Central Texas. The bond provides that Star, Great American,\n\nand Central Texas agree that claimants not timely paid in full may sue on the bond “in a state court\n\nof competent jurisdiction in and for the county or other political subdivision of the state in which the\n\nproject, or any part thereof, is situated, or in the United States District Court for the district in which\n\nthe project, or any part thereof, is situated, and not elsewhere.”\n\n                Star and Great American argue that the Miller Act requires contractors on “public\n\nwork” projects to provide performance and payment bonds and that this highway project is a public\n\nwork because it is a federally funded project for the purpose of creating a roadway for public use.\n\nStar relies on a Fifth Circuit case, Continental Casualty Co. v. C.O. Brand, Inc., for the proposition\n\nthat “a ‘public work’ within the Miller Act is ‘any work in which the United States is interested and\n\nwhich is done for the public and for which the United States is authorized to expend funds.’”\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"270552\"><a href=\"/opinion/270552/continental-casualty-company-v-c-o-brand-inc-and-hartford-accident/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974 (5th Cir. 1966) (quoting Peterson v.

In Continental Casualty, the court was not considering whether\n\nto apply either the Miller Act or a state act requiring bonds in a construction project.

In making the statement quoted by Star, the court was disagreeing\n\nwith the Tenth Circuit’s holding that Capeheart Act housing projects are not “public works” within\n\nthe meaning of the Miller Act. Id. at 974.\n\n                In a more recent case deciding whether the Miller Act should apply to a company’s\n\nbonds issued for various “public-works contracts” entered into with Arizona state and municipal\n\nentities, including highway construction with funding from the Federal Highway Administration, the\n\nNinth Circuit upheld the district court’s determination that the projects were not “public works of\n\nthe United States.” Operating Eng’rs Health & Welfare Trust Fund v.

The court explained that:\n\n\n        Although there is no clear test for designating a project a “public work of the United\n        States,” courts often look to the following as indicia: whether the United States is a\n        contracting party, an obligee to the bond, an initiator or ultimate operator of the\n        project; whether the work is done on property belonging to the United States; or\n        whether the bonds are issued under the Miller Act.10\n\n\n        10\n           Star relies on two cases that it asserts stand for the proposition that the Miller Act applies\nto “public works,” even if the United States does not own the real estate, is not a party to the\nconstruction contract, and is not an obligee on the bond.

Sullivan,\n795 F. Supp. at 306. When concluding the Miller Act applied to the post-office project, the court\ndistinguished the project at issue from another case in part because the state highway project in the\nother case, like the project at issue in this case, was only partially federally funded, was not built for\n\n                                                   20\n\fId. at 675.

For all these reasons, we conclude that the bond was\n\nnot issued on a contract governed by the Miller Act.\n\n               We conclude that the trial court correctly decided as a matter of law that the Miller\n\nAct did not deprive it of subject-matter jurisdiction over Dig Tech’s suit seeking payment on the\n\nbond. We overrule Star and Great American’s eighth issue.\n\n\nApplication of the McGregor Act\n\n               Star and Great American argue in the alternative that if the McGregor Act applies to\n\nDig Tech’s claim against the bond, the trial court erred by ruling as a matter of law that Dig Tech\n\nperfected its claim. At trial, evidence was admitted showing that Dig Tech provided notice to Star,\n\nCentral Texas, and Great American of its claim on the payment bond that Central Texas required\n\n                                                  22\n\fStar to furnish as part of the subcontracts between Central Texas and Star. Star and Great American\n\nchallenge the effectiveness of Dig Tech’s notice to Central Texas and to Great American. At the\n\nclose of Dig Tech’s case, Great American moved for directed verdict on the notice issues, which it\n\nhad previously raised in defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction. Great American argued that Dig Tech\n\nnever gave notice to the “prime contractor,” as that term is defined in the Act, and never gave sworn\n\nnotice to Great American, as required by the Act. The trial court denied Great American’s motion.\n\nLater in trial, during the charge conference, Dig Tech asked the trial court for an order that “Dig\n\nTech has substantially complied with the notice provisions such that [Great American] has notice\n\nof our bond claim.” The trial judge stated that he was not submitting that issue to the jury and\n\n“essentially that’s exactly what’s happened here. . . . I’ve agreed not to submit this to the jury as a\n\nfact question — as a matter of law[,] I’m making that determination . . . .”\n\n               Star and Great American contend that this was error because Dig Tech failed to\n\ncomply in two ways with the Act’s notice provisions. First, they assert that the Act required Dig\n\nTech to provide notice to the “prime contractor” of its claim, and that as the Act defines “prime\n\ncontractor,” the prime contractor in this case was SH 130 Concession. See Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§§ 2253.001 (defining “prime contractor” as “a person, firm, or corporation that makes a public work\n\ncontract with a governmental entity”), .041 (establishing notice to prime contractor and surety\n\nrequired from payment-bond beneficiary for payment claim), .047 (establishing additional notice\n\nrequired from payment-bond beneficiary without direct contractual relationship with prime\n\ncontractor). Second, they assert that Dig Tech never provided a sworn statement of account to Great\n\nAmerican that complied with the requirements of Section 2253.041.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f               The Texas Legislature passed the McGregor Act to create a method to ensure that\n\nsubcontractors and suppliers on public-works projects are paid for their labor and materials because\n\nthey generally may not place liens against public buildings or other public works.

App.—San Antonio\n\nJan. 2, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding as matter of law that notice mailed over one year late\n\nwithout sworn statement prevented subcontractor from recovering against payment bond). The\n\nsubstance of Star and Great American’s issues with Dig Tech’s notice, however, is not that the notice\n\nwas untimely. Instead, they argue that Great American never received the sworn statement required\n\nto be delivered with notice of the claim and that Dig Tech did not serve the proper party as\n\nprime contractor.\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f               We first address Star and Great American’s argument that Great American never\n\nreceived the sworn statement required to be delivered with notice of the claim because our\n\ndisposition of that issue aids in our resolution of the other notice issue. Dig Tech’s counsel sent\n\nGreat American a letter via certified mail on May 1, 2012 (with return receipt signed May 7),\n\ninforming Great American that the law firm represented Dig Tech in its claim for unpaid amounts\n\ndue based on labor and materials provided to Star on the SH 130 Segments 5 and 6 project. The\n\nletter advised Great American that no payments at all had been made to Dig Tech, and accordingly,\n\nsuit would be filed on the bond “on the 91st day after April 4, 2012, the last day on which Dig Tech’s\n\nwork or labor was done or performed, if all invoices have not been paid in full by that time.” The\n\nletter further advised Great American that all invoices and claims for payment had previously been\n\nsent to Star and that “the invoices and descriptions of work” were copied and enclosed with the\n\nletter. Great American does not dispute that the invoices and descriptions were attached to the letter.\n\nGreat American also does not assert that the amount claimed was later materially amended.\n\n               While notice is a substantive condition precedent to a party’s ability to pursue a claim\n\non a bond, numerous courts have liberally construed the requirement that written notice of a claim\n\n“must be accompanied by a sworn statement of account that states in substance: (1) the amount\n\nclaimed is just and correct; and (2) all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits known to the\n\naffiant have been allowed.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.041(c) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Boring\n\n& Tunneling Co., 321 S.W.3d at 28-29 (First Court of Appeals); Kirby Rest. Equip., 170 S.W.3d at\n\n147-48 (Fourth Court of Appeals); Acme Brick, 816 S.W.2d at 441 (Tenth Court of Appeals);\n\nFeatherlite, 714 S.W.2d at 69-70 (Fourteenth Court of Appeals); Parker Bros. & Co., 437 S.W.2d\n\nat 881-82 (First Court of Appeals). Dig Tech’s letter indicated that it was presenting a claim for\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f“unpaid amounts due” for work completed for Star. This type of language has been deemed\n\nsufficient to inform the surety in substance that the amount claimed is “just and correct” and that “all\n\njust and lawful offsets, payments, and credits known to the affiant have been allowed.” See Kirby\n\nRest. Equip., 170 S.W.3d at 148 & n.2. Great American also contends that because no sworn\n\nstatement accompanied the notice, Dig Tech failed to perfect its claim, relying on Laboratory\n\nDesign. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">36614</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (holding claimant who mailed notice over one year after\n\nstatutory deadline without including sworn statement did not substantially comply with statutory\n\nrequirements). The opinion in that case describes an earlier letter informing the governmental\n\nauthority (acting as surety) of the amount owed, but it does not provide any description of the later\n\nletter filed over a year after the deadline that the claimant argued substantially complied with the\n\nstatutory requirements. See id. at *1 (describing June 3, 2004 letter), *3 (identifying letter mailed\n\nJune 15, 2005, as letter relied on to establish notice of claim). Consequently, it is unclear what, if\n\nany, similarity the notice letter in that case has to the notice letter in this case. In addition, the court\n\nin Laboratory Design does not appear to have been presented with the issue of actual notice, which\n\nalso makes it distinguishable from the facts here.\n\n                In this case, Dig Tech presented evidence at trial supporting its contention that its\n\nnotice to Great American substantially complied with the McGregor Act and that Great American\n\nhad actual notice of Dig Tech’s claim. Substantial compliance occurs “‘when an actor’s deviation\n\nfrom compliance [with the essential requirements of a statute] does not seriously impede the\n\nlegislative purpose of the statute,’ that is, when actual notice of the claims are provided.” Dudley\n\nConstr., Ltd. v.

In this\n\ncase, Dig Tech’s May 1 letter sent via certified mail to Great American and the May 9 letter from\n\nCentral Texas to Star claimed an amount due based on the invoices included in the claim that was\n\nsubstantially the same as the amount Dig Tech sought at trial and was awarded. In addition, two\n\nother documents admitted at trial support Dig Tech’s claim that Great American had actual notice\n\nof the claim. The first document is a May 18, 2012 email from Star’s president to a Star employee,\n\nwhich states “Anthony - Please forward me any email correspondence you have concerning Dig\n\nTech. I need to respond and coordinate with our attorney and surety. Please send today as this has\n\nbeen escalated.” (Emphasis added.) The second document is a February 1, 2013 letter from Star’s\n\npresident presenting a formal prompt-payment complaint against Central Texas. In that letter, Star’s\n\npresident states the following: “Dig Tech has asserted NO CLAIMS against [Central Texas]. Dig\n\nTech asserted claims against STAR back in May 2012 and filed notice on STAR’S BOND furnished\n\nfor the benefit of [Central Texas]. Star provided payment and performance bonds to [Central Texas]\n\nfor both subcontract agreements . . . . Central Texas has no contractual reason to withhold funds\n\nclaimed by Dig Tech.” (Italics added.)\n\n               The legislative purpose of the McGregor Act “is to protect claimants who supply\n\nlabor and material in the construction of public works, and to provide a simple and direct method\n\nof giving notice and perfecting claims.” Argee, 932 S.W.2d at 52-53. The evident purpose of the\n\nAct’s requirement that a claimant accompany its written notice of a claim to a surety with a sworn\n\nstatement is to provide the surety with true and accurate information about the amount of the claim,\n\nso that the surety may prepare to defend against the claim. On this record, Dig Tech’s deviation from\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fthe Act’s requirement to include a sworn statement has not seriously hindered the legislature’s\n\npurpose in imposing the sworn-statement requirement because Great American had actual notice of\n\ntrue and accurate information about the amount of the claim. See Stratton, 8 S.W.3d at 31. Actual\n\nnotice to the surety constitutes substantial compliance with the notice requirements.

See Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 2253.041, .047. As an initial matter, Star and Great American fail\n\nto explain why lack of notice to SH 130 Concession should preclude Dig Tech from recovery on the\n\nbond, when Dig Tech notified the three parties named on the bond—the obligee, Central Texas; the\n\nprincipal and obligor, Star; and the surety, Great American.

(holding\n\nsubcontractor’s failure to send notice of claim to prime contractor via certified mail did not preclude\n\nsubcontractor from recovery on bond when surety received actual notice that complied with statutory\n\nrequirements); see also Argee Corp., 932 S.W.2d at 53 (“We do not perceive the legislative purpose\n\nbehind the McGregor Act to be that of creating technical tricks, traps and stumbling blocks to the\n\nfiling of legitimate notices of claims.”).\n\n               Moreover, the only payment bond required under the Act is the bond that the\n\ngovernmental entity requires the prime contractor to obtain. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.021(a)(2), (c).\n\nOn that bond, the governmental entity is the obligee, while the prime contractor is the principal and\n\nobligor who is liable and who may be sued jointly and severally with its surety by a payment-bond\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fbeneficiary if a claim is not paid. In contrast, on the bond at issue in this case, Central Texas is the\n\nobligee, while Star is the principal and obligor who is liable and who may be sued jointly and\n\nseverally with Great American, its surety, if a claim is not paid. The parties do not dispute that Dig\n\nTech is a payment-bond beneficiary of Great American’s bond, which was provided by Star for the\n\nprotection of Cental Texas, the obligee named in the bond, from claims by subcontractors\n\nand suppliers.\n\n                 The McGregor Act contemplates projects that are more simply structured than the\n\nproject at issue here. The Act requires a governmental entity that makes a public-work contract with\n\na prime contractor to require the contractor to execute payment and performance bonds in favor of\n\nthe governmental entity before work begins. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.021(a). The performance\n\nbond protects the state or governmental entity, id. § 2253.021(b), while the payment bond protects\n\n“payment bond beneficiaries who have a direct contractual relationship with the prime contractor\n\nor a subcontractor to supply public work labor or material,” id. § 2253.021(c)(1). The Act does not\n\nmandate that subcontractors on a public-work project obtain payment bonds. In this case, the\n\nSH 130 Segments 5 and 6 construction project was governed by a comprehensive development\n\nagreement (CDA) involving multiple contracts, including the Facility Concession Agreement\n\nentered into by TxDOT and SH 130 Concession Company.11 See generally Tex. Transp. Code\n\n§§ 223.201-.209 (authorizing TxDOT to enter into CDAs). As part of that agreement, TxDOT\n\n\n       11\n          That agreement explains that TxDOT entered into the CDA with Cintra-Zachry, LP and\nthat the CDA contemplated that Cintra-Zachry or one of its affiliates (i.e., SH 130 Concession\nCompany) may enter into agreements for development of one or more transportation facilities,\nincluding SH 130 Segments 5 and 6. Central Texas’s project-controls manager explained at trial\nthat his employer was actually Zachry Construction Corporation because Central Texas was a\nspecial-purpose entity created by Zachry Construction Corporation for the purpose of designing and\nconstructing the SH 130 Segments 5 and 6.\n\n                                                  31\n\frequired SH 130 Concession Company to obtain payment and performance bonds. SH 130\n\nConcession Company, as developer on the project, then entered into an agreement with Central\n\nTexas for Central Texas to design and build the SH 130 Segments 5 and 6. Central Texas, in turn,\n\nentered into subcontracts with various subcontractors and suppliers, including Star. Central Texas\n\ncontractually required Star to obtain its own payment and performance bonds. Given the complex\n\nstructure of the CDA and its chain of contracts under which each subcontractor is contractually\n\nrequired to obtain its own payment bonds, essentially stepping into the shoes of a prime contractor\n\nvis-à-vis its lower-tier subcontractor, Dig Tech’s notice to Central Texas, Star, and Great American\n\ncomports with the overarching purpose of the McGregor Act.\n\n               The Act also requires a payment-bond beneficiary to give notice to the prime\n\ncontractor of both unpaid claims and the amount of any retainage applicable to the account that has\n\nnot become due under the terms of the agreement between the prime contractor or a subcontractor\n\nand the payment-bond beneficiary. Id. § 2253.041(a), (d). The purpose of these notice requirements\n\nis “to protect the prime contractor from incurring double liability,” which could happen in the past\n\nbefore the legislature added the notice provisions to the statute, if a contractor paid a subcontractor\n\nin full and then later found a claim presented against it from someone who dealt only with the\n\nsubcontractor. Spaw-Glass Corp., 877 S.W.2d at 540. In this particular case, the record indicates\n\nthat SH 130 Concession was the party who had a contract with the governmental entity (i.e., the\n\n“prime contractor” as defined by the Act), but that SH 130 Concession bore no risk of liability to Dig\n\nTech, much less a risk of double liability. Under the terms of the bond, Star and Great American\n\nbound themselves to Central Texas as obligee “for the use and benefit of Claimants” in the amount\n\nof $3.1 million for payment for labor and material required for the performance of Star’s subcontract\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fwith Central Texas. Both Star, as principal, and Great American, as surety, received actual notice\n\nof Dig Tech’s claim. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 2253.73 (allowing payment-bond beneficiary to “sue\n\nthe principal or surety, jointly or severally on the payment bond” for unpaid claim); Dealers Elec.\n\nSupply Co., 292 S.W.3d at 660 (holding that McGregor Act provides “mandatory and exclusive\n\nremedy against a surety and obligor on a public-work payment bond” issued under the Act). On this\n\nrecord, we must give the statute “the most comprehensive and liberal construction possible” to\n\naccomplish the remedial purpose of the Act.12 See Dealers Elec. Supply Co., 292 S.W.3d at 659\n\n(holding McGregor Act’s overarching purpose is “to protect unpaid laborers and materialmen by\n\nproviding them an additional funding source—a payment bond—in the event the prime contractor\n\nfails to meet its obligations”); Featherlite, 714 S.W.2d at 69. Under the circumstances presented\n\n\n\n       12\n            Although no party has raised this issue, it is questionable whether the McGregor Act\nshould apply to the contractually required bond at issue in this case. The only payment bond\nrequired under the Act is one that a governmental entity requires a prime contractor to execute to the\ngovernmental entity before beginning the work. Tex.

As stated,\nthe parties proceeded at trial and on appeal as if the McGregor Act must apply if the Miller Act does\nnot and have not raised the issue of the Act’s applicability. The bond itself contains no specific\nnotice requirements, meaning that if the McGregor Act does not apply, Dig Tech was not required\nto provide notice of its claim at any particular time or in any particular form before suit. See Johnson\nServ. Co., 409 S.W.2d at 474 (holding that because McGregor Act did not apply, claimant’s case\nagainst surety must be determined only by bond’s terms, not any McGregor Act provisions). As a\nresult, whether we analyze Dig Tech’s claim against the bond under the McGregor Act or as a\ncommon-law contractual obligation, we conclude the trial court did not err by determining that Dig\nTech perfected its bond claim against Great American.\n\n                                                  33\n\fhere, Dig Tech’s deviation from the Act’s requirement to provide the prime contractor with notice\n\nhas not seriously hindered the legislature’s purpose because Star as principal and Great American\n\nas surety on the bond both had actual notice of true and accurate information about the amount of\n\nthe claim before suit was filed against them.13 See Tex.

We note that before sending its notice, Dig\nTech requested that Star send it a copy of Star’s contract with Central Texas and its bond. Dig\nTech’s vice-president Mike Furry testified that Star’s president never sent him the contract. It is\nunclear from the record how Dig Tech eventually obtained any information about Star’s contracts\nand bonds, but this information was in Star’s possession, not Dig Tech’s. This is the sort of\ntechnical trap that the McGregor Act aims to prevent.\n\n                                                  34\n\fthe trial court did not err by ruling that Dig Tech perfected its claim against the bond.

We overrule Star and Great American’s issues nine through eleven.\n\n\nApplication of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 18.091\n\n                 In their twelfth issue, Star and Great American assert that the trial court erred in\n\nawarding damages to Dig Tech without any evidence of Dig Tech’s actual damages presented in the\n\nform of a net loss after reduction for income-tax payments or unpaid income-tax liability, which\n\nthey contend is required by Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 18.091. Section\n\n18.091 states:\n\n\n        § 18.091. Proof of Certain Losses; Jury Instruction\n\n        (a)      Notwithstanding any other law, if any claimant seeks recovery for loss of\n                 earnings, loss of earning capacity, loss of contributions of a pecuniary value,\n                 or loss of inheritance, evidence to prove the loss must be presented in the\n                 form of a net loss after reduction for income tax payments or unpaid tax\n                 liability pursuant to any federal income tax law.\n\n        (b)      If any claimant seeks recovery for loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity,\n                 loss of contributions of a pecuniary value, or loss of inheritance, the court\n                 shall instruct the jury as to whether any recovery for compensatory damages\n                 sought by the claimant is subject to federal or state income taxes.\n\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 18.091. Star and Great American’s argument focuses on the “loss\n\nof earnings” category in Subsection (a) and they make no assertion that the other three categories\n\nwould be applicable to this case. Star and Great American reason that since Dig Tech’s invoices\n\n\n                                                   35\n\fwould result in ordinary revenue, they constitute “earnings” within the meaning of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code and federal income tax would be duly owed by Dig Tech. Consequently, Star and\n\nGreat American assert that Dig Tech’s failure to present net-of-taxes evidence precludes its recovery\n\nat trial.\n\n               In support of their assertion that Section 18.091 requires Dig Tech to prove\n\nnet-of-taxes damages in this case, Star and Great American rely on Interconex, Inc. v.

On appeal,\n\nInterconex asserted that the plaintiff failed to comply with the net-of-taxes requirement of Section\n\n18.091, but the court found that such issue was waived and therefore it did not address the\n\nnet-of-taxes requirement, nor did it expressly or tacitly approve the application of Section 18.091\n\nin a breach-of-contract case. Id. at 532-33.\n\n               In Gallegos, an employee brought a negligence action against his employer, seeking\n\ndamages for lost earning capacity resulting from an on-the-job injury. 365 S.W.3d at 175. The\n\nemployee testified to pre-tax wages without objection and the court’s ultimate analysis came down\n\nto the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s award of lost earning capacity in the past and\n\nin the future. Id. at 178-79. The case specifically involved damages resulting from a personal injury\n\n\n\n\n                                                  36\n\fand there was no discussion of the application of Section 18.091 to other types of damages such as\n\ncontract damages.\n\n                In their briefing, the parties advance differing views of whether Section 18.091\n\napplies to this type of case. A review of the pleadings, evidence, charge, and judgment in this case\n\nindicates that this is a breach-of-contract case as opposed to a case involving damages resulting from\n\na personal injury rendering a party unable to work.14 Star and Great American argue that the\n\nlanguage of Section 18.091 is broad and is not expressly limited to personal-injury cases. Dig Tech\n\ncounters that Section 18.091 applies only to personal-injury cases, not contract cases, because\n\ndamages received in a breach-of-contract case are taxable, and application of the section would\n\neffectively result in double taxation on such contract plaintiffs.\n\n                Our inquiry starts with the language of the statute. Both Subsection (a) and (b)\n\ncontain the phrase “if any claimant seeks recovery for . . .” preceding the types of losses that must\n\nbe presented in the form of net of taxes. This language expressly points the analysis to the type of\n\ndamages sought to be recovered, rather than the type of liability claims (contract or personal injury)\n\nin question. The liability claims are still relevant, however, because different liability claims result\n\nin different types of damages. Here, Dig Tech sought recovery of breach-of-contract damages from\n\nStar based on the amount of the unpaid invoices in question. After the evidence closed, the jury was\n\ncharged with fairly standard breach-of-contract jury questions asking whether Dig Tech and Star had\n\nan agreement, whether Star failed to comply with the agreement, and whether Star’s failure to\n\ncomply was excused by Dig Tech’s failure to comply with a material obligation of the same\n\n\n       14\n          Dig Tech also requested and received quantum meruit questions included in the charge\nbut because the jury answered “Yes” to Question 1 (existence of a contract), the jury was instructed\nnot to answer those questions.\n\n                                                  37\n\fagreement. Ultimately, the jury was asked the damages question conditioned on a finding of Star’s\n\nfailure to comply. Question 4 of the charge (the damages question) reads as follows:\n\n\n                                             Question 4\n\n                What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably\n       compensate Dig Tech for its damages, if any, that resulted from Star Operations’\n       failure to comply?\n\n               Consider the following elements of damages, if any, and none other.\n\n               The reasonable value of the work performed by Dig Tech at the time and\n               place it was performed.\n\n               Answer in Dollars and Cents, if any.\n\n               Answer: _______________\n\n\nDig Tech did not seek recovery of “loss of earnings” as that phrase is typically used in the Texas\n\nPattern Jury Charge and Texas case law, nor was the jury charged to assess such an element of\n\ndamages. The cases on loss of earnings tend to center on the burden of proof and distinguishing loss\n\nof earnings from loss-of-earning capacity. See Strauss v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335502\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335502/strauss-v-continental-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n435-43 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.). However, the parties have cited no cases,\n\nand we have found none, that allow a corporation such as Dig Tech to recover loss of earnings as a\n\nmeasure of damages following the breach of an agreement. The cases in which this measure of\n\ndamages is sought to be recovered are generally personal-injury cases. The Internal Revenue Code\n\nauthorizes compensation received on account of personal injuries or sickness to be excluded from\n\ngross income. 26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(2). “Presumably, the purpose of [Section 18.091] is to prevent\n\na plaintiff from obtaining a windfall by being awarded pretax income on awards that are not subject\n\nto taxation.” Gallegos, 365 S.W.3d at 179.\n\n                                                38\n\f                In contrast, a corporation such as Dig Tech would be required to report\n\nbreach-of-contract damages from a court award as ordinary income. Internal Revenue Service,\n\nU.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, Pub. No. 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income: For Use in Preparing\n\n2016 Returns 29 (2017), https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p525.pdf. Furthermore, Dig Tech did not\n\nseek recovery of loss of earnings, and the evidence did not demonstrate that it lost earnings or\n\nsuffered a loss of the opportunity or ability to obtain earnings. Instead, Dig Tech failed to receive\n\nits benefit of the bargain—payment—after it had performed the work. Based on the facts of the\n\nbusiness dispute presented by this case, Star and Great American’s assertion would require us to\n\nstretch the interpretation of Section 18.091 to fit a category of damages to which it seemingly was\n\nnot intended to apply and in which there is no discernable potential for a plaintiff to obtain a windfall\n\nof tax-free damages. We decline to do so. Accordingly, we overrule Star and Great American’s\n\nissue twelve.\n\n\nDig Tech’s attorneys’ fees award\n\n                In their thirteenth issue, Star and Great American assert that the trial court erred in\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees to Dig Tech because Dig Tech failed to segregate recoverable attorneys’\n\nfees from unrecoverable attorneys’ fees. In support of this argument, Star and Great American cite\n\nTony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.

However, we need not address\n\nthis issue. Star and Great American offered no objection to the attorneys’ fees question—Question\n\nNo. 9—during the charge conference. Consequently, Star and Great American did not specifically\n\nobject to the attorneys’ fees question on the ground that it failed to segregate recoverable fees from\n\nunrecoverable fees. See Tex. R.

Id. at 239.\n\n                Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 31.007 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n        (b)     A judge of any court may include in any order or judgment all costs,\n                including the following:\n\n                (1)     fees of the clerk and service fees due the county;\n\n                (2)     fees of the court reporter for the original of stenographic transcripts\n                        necessarily obtained for use in the suit;\n\n                (3)     masters, interpreters, and guardians ad litem appointed pursuant to\n                        these rules and state statutes; and\n\n                (4)     such other costs and fees as may be permitted by these rules and state\nstatutes.\n\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 31.007(b). Relevant here is Subsection (b)(2), which allows the\n\n“fees of the court reporter for the original of stenographic transcripts necessarily obtained for use in\n\n                                                  40\n\fthe suit” to be included as costs awarded in the judgment. The dispute here focuses not on whether\n\nthe seven deposition transcripts in question were necessarily obtained for use in the suit but on\n\nwhether Dig Tech could recover costs for obtaining copies of those deposition transcripts when it\n\ndid not notice or initiate the depositions, and thus it was only paying for the copies, as opposed to\n\npaying the court reporter’s fee for the original transcript. Section 31.007(b)(2) specifically allows\n\nrecovery of the court reporter’s fee for the original stenographic transcript as a taxable court cost.\n\nWe agree with the reasoning of our sister court in Gumpert. In that case, the court concluded that\n\nSection 31.007(b) specifically limits recovery of costs to the fees of the court reporter for the original\n\nof stenographic transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the suit and that because no other statute\n\nor rule authorizes the recovery of costs to obtain copies of deposition transcripts, it was error to\n\naward such costs.
