However, the District Court retained the case until six months after the next Quarterly County Court election.

This court is composed of magistrates, also known as justices of the peace.  Although the judicial functions formerly exercised by justices of the peace now are vested in the local Courts of General Sessions, the members of the Quarterly Court continue to perform many important functions of local government.  In The Redistricting Cases, 111 Tenn. 234, 253, 80 S.W. 750 (1903), the Supreme Court of Tennessee said: 'It is quite impossible . . . to speak intelligently of our county organizations without bringing into view the county court, the chief organ in the expression of its political, judicial and municipal life.'  In the same opinion the court quoted with approval an earlier decision describing Quarterly County Courts as 'miniature legislatures.'  111 Tenn. at 257, 80 S.W. 750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally in Tennessee the magistrates constituting the Quarterly County Court have been elected from the civil districts and not from the county at large.

A similar provision was contained in the Constitution of 1834.

As thus reapportioned, the Quarterly County Court consists of 27 members, one from each of the ten civil districts, 13 from the City of Jackson and four from the county at large.

In November, 1968 special election there were 6 black candidates running from 5 different county districts out of a total of 82 candidates running from 10 civil districts and 13 county districts.  The low vote for a successful white candidate (John P. Petty-- County District 11) was 3,338 votes, whereas the high vote among the unsuccessful black candidates was 2,614 (Ausie Brooks running from County District 8-- the City of Jackson).  Had 2/3 of the Madison County registered blacks voted for Leon Batchelor, a black, in County District 13 in that election, he would have been elected without obtaining a single white vote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Savannah Williamson, the only black, ran 5th out of a field of 8 candidates from County District 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The plaintiffs produced evidence showing that all county officials elected by the Quarterly County Court were white (except of Notaries Public) including all five Road and Workhouse Commissioners, but all elected county officials including Sheriff, Trustee, Register and 9 Constables were also white.

No blacks have been appointed by the County Court to the County Library Board, the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Beer Commission, the County Agriculture Committee or Road Commission or General Hospital Committee, among others.  It is therefore no wonder that black plaintiffs have alleged in this complaint that the County Court and their elected Chairman, the County Judge, are and have been insensitive to and are comparatively unconcerned about black problems, needs, and aspirations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The history of Madison County, like virtually all other West Tennessee counties, has been a history of segregation prior to the mid-1950's, and unquestionably there has been overt racial discrimination in many aspects of life, in both the public and private areas, for most of Madison County's 150 year history, or at least until very recent years.  For 100 years perhaps no black has been elected to a public office in Madison County, though it should be pointed out that the newly elected Mayor of Jackson apparently has appointed a number of blacks to positions of responsibility in City affairs on several City boards and agencies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The County Court and the County School Boards over many years have fought efforts to desegregate its public schools.

This was, of course, the experience in nearby City of Memphis and in Shelby County, Tennessee, when municipal and county governmental elections were fashioned in the 1960's on the basis of single member district voting.  The 'minority' Republican Party in Shelby County also experienced like success in electing Republican state representatives and senators from single member districts rather than on an 'at large' basis in the early 1960's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It appears that white magistrates both prior to and after the 1968 reapportionment did make contact with and seek support of black leaders and voters in campaigns for the Madison County Quarterly Court.
