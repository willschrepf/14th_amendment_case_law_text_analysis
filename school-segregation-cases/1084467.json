Pooler argues that his\n\ntrial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in the penalty phase of his murder\n\ntrial for (1) failing to discover that certain information Pooler himself told counsel\n\nabout his background was false, and (2) relying on court-appointed competency\n\nexperts to testify instead of retaining defense experts to investigate mitigation\n\nevidence specifically. The Florida state courts denied Pooler’s ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims. After review and oral argument, we conclude, as did\n\nthe district court, that the state courts’ denial of Pooler’s claims was not\n\nunreasonable. We affirm.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Facts of the Crime\n\n      On January 30, 1995, Pooler murdered his ex-girlfriend, Kim Brown, after\n\nlearning that she had begun seeing another man. Before the murder, Pooler\n\nthreatened to kill Brown. Two days later, Pooler went to Brown’s apartment and\n\nshot her five times while she begged Pooler not to kill her. Pooler also shot\n\nBrown’s younger brother. The Florida Supreme Court summarized the evidence\n\npresented at the guilt phase of Pooler’s trial:\n\n      On January 28, 1995, Carolyn Glass, a long-time acquaintance of Kim\n      Brown, told her that Pooler had said he was going to kill her because\n      if he could not have her, no one else would. . . . Two days later, Pooler\n      knocked on the front door of the apartment where Kim and her\n                                           2\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 3 of 58\n\n      younger brother, Alvonza Colson, lived with their mother. Seeing\n      Pooler through the door window, Kim told him that she did not want\n      to see him anymore. Alvonza opened the door halfway and asked\n      Pooler what he wanted but would not let him in. When Pooler\n      brandished a gun, Alvonza let go of the door and tried to run out the\n      door, but he was shot in the back by Pooler. Pooler pulled Alvonza\n      back into the apartment by his leg. Kim begged Pooler not to kill her\n      brother or her and began vomiting into her hands. She suggested they\n      take Alvonza to the hospital. Pooler originally agreed but then told\n      Alvonza to stay and call himself an ambulance while Pooler left with\n      Kim. However, rather than follow Pooler out the door, Kim shut and\n      locked it behind him. Alvonza told Kim to run out the back door for\n      her life while he stayed in the apartment to call for an ambulance.\n      When he discovered that the telephone wires had been cut, he started\n      for the back door, just as Pooler was breaking in through the front\n      entrance.\n             Pooler first found Alvonza, who was hiding in an area near the\n      back door, but when he heard Kim yelling for help, he left Alvonza\n      and continued after Kim. When he eventually caught up with her, he\n      struck her in the head with his gun, causing it to discharge. In front of\n      numerous witnesses, he pulled her toward his car as she screamed and\n      begged him not to kill her. When she fought against going in the car,\n      Pooler pulled her back toward the apartment building and shot her\n      several times, pausing once to say, “You want some more?” Kim had\n      been shot a total of five times, including once in the head. Pooler then\n      got into his car and drove away.\n\nPooler v. State, 704 So. 2d 1375, 1377 (Fla. 1997) (“Pooler I”).\n\n      Police arrested Pooler at his home. The State indicted him on charges of\n\nfirst-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and armed burglary. The state\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 4 of 58\n\ntrial court appointed veteran criminal defense attorney Michael Salnick to\n\nrepresent Pooler. 1\n\nB.     Trial Counsel’s Investigation of Mitigating Evidence\n\n       In May 1995, trial counsel Salnick moved the court for funds to hire an\n\ninvestigator to help prepare for trial, and also specifically to travel to Louisiana—\n\nwhere Pooler grew up and where his family still lived—to interview witnesses “for\n\nPhase 2 [i.e., penalty phase] discovery.” The state trial court granted the motion,\n\nand Salnick retained an experienced private investigator, Marvin Jenne.\n\n       Salnick and Jenne had worked together “in almost every significant case”\n\nSalnick had in private practice. 2 Salnick instructed Jenne to “find anything and\n\neverything” he could about Pooler, whether good or bad. Salnick, as he later\n\ntestified in postconviction proceedings, wanted to consider anything that would\n\nsave his client’s life.\n\n       Investigator Jenne’s invoice includes entries showing these penalty-phase-\n\nrelated efforts: (1) attending a 2.2 hour meeting with Pooler to discuss “potential\n\nfamily members in Louisiana to be interviewed in Phase II investigation”; (2)\n\n\n\n       1\n        At the time of his appointment to represent Pooler, Salnick had been practicing law for\nabout sixteen years. Salnick had experience handling murder cases and penalty-phase\nproceedings.\n       2\n       At the time of Pooler’s case, Jenne had been an investigator for fifteen years and had\nworked on five to ten capital cases.\n\n\n                                                4\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 5 of 58\n\nsending letters to Pooler’s family members in Louisiana; (3) making telephone\n\ncalls to family members Delores Pooler, Darren Warren, and Carolyn Upps; (4)\n\ntraveling to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for three days to interview Pooler’s family\n\nmembers regarding mitigation; (5) sending multiple letters to schools Pooler\n\nattended; and (6) attending a 1.9 hour meeting with Pooler to discuss the\n\ninterviews with Pooler’s family members. 3\n\n       Pooler told Salnick and Jenne that he graduated high school, had four\n\ndaughters in Louisiana, and worked for seven years at a moving company. Pooler\n\nalso reported that he served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam\n\nWar, re-enlisted after his original period of enlistment, and received an honorable\n\ndischarge.\n\n       Investigator Jenne tried to corroborate all the background information he\n\nreceived from Pooler by talking with other persons. Jenne made telephone calls\n\nand sent letters requesting Pooler’s school records, but he “was basically told [the\n\nrecords] were not available.” Jenne asked Pooler’s relatives, including his father,\n\nwhether Pooler graduated from high school. The relatives said Pooler graduated.\n\n       The defense made an effort to obtain Pooler’s military records, but the\n\nattempt was unsuccessful. Pooler’s brother confirmed that Pooler served in the\n\n       3\n        Jenne’s records contain the name and telephone number of Pooler’s nephew Brian\nWarren, who lived in Orlando, Florida. Jenne did not recall whether he ever spoke with Brian\nWarren.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 6 of 58\n\nMarines and was honorably discharged. Jenne asked other relatives about Pooler’s\n\nmilitary service, and all of them said he served honorably in Vietnam.\n\n      Jenne obtained some employment records relating to Pooler’s work history\n\nin Palm Beach County, Florida. Jenne interviewed two of Pooler’s co-workers at\n\nthe moving company in West Palm Beach, Alice Bradford and Carlton Weeks.\n\nSalnick decided Alice Bradford would be the better witness because Weeks, who\n\nwas Pooler’s supervisor, made some comments that Salnick “thought could have\n\nbeen troublesome and if he was deposed and it was further explored there might\n\nhave been some more negative information that came out.”\n\n      Weeks stated that Pooler was a “good worker as long as things went totally\n\nhis way,” but Pooler was “aggressive” and had “a chip on his shoulder.” Pooler\n\nwas short-tempered, wanted to take charge on every task he was assigned, and\n\nmost of his co-workers “did not care to work with him.” Because of Pooler’s\n\naggressiveness, there was “[a]lways a problem” between him and his co-workers.\n\nPooler “was just narrow minded and hard headed and very aggressive.” Pooler got\n\ninto arguments with co-workers that Weeks had to resolve. Weeks found it\n\ndifficult to find people to work with Pooler “because of his temperament.”\n\n      Furthermore, Weeks believed that Pooler “appear[ed] to be a violent\n\nperson.” Pooler owned a gun and sometimes brought it to work. One time, Pooler\n\ngot into an argument with a co-worker and returned with his gun and was “waving\n\n\n                                         6\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 7 of 58\n\nit around threatening people.” In fact, Salnick reported that “[o]ne of the things\n\nthat ran through a lot of stuff that we looked at, was that Mr. Pooler had a violent\n\nbackground, he had been known to carry a gun, chased people, he’d been known to\n\nargue, to hit somebody.”\n\n       The defense team investigated whether Pooler had a drinking problem,\n\nwhich entailed obtaining police reports and interviewing relatives and current and\n\nformer employers. Salnick discovered before trial that Pooler had gone to the\n\npolice department a few hours before Brown’s murder to report a crime. The\n\npolice report stated that Pooler had been sitting in his car early that morning with a\n\nfriend of Pooler’s girlfriend. Pooler “fell asleep due to intoxication,” and when he\n\nawoke about two hours later, “his wallet was in his front pocket and $301.00 were\n\nmissing.” Pooler reported the theft occurred about 3:00 am, and he arrived at the\n\npolice station at 6:43 am.\n\n       Pooler told Salnick that the woman who robbed him was a prostitute.\n\nSalnick did not want the jury to be aware of Pooler’s time spent with a prostitute a\n\nfew hours before he murdered his ex-girlfriend, stating later that “[t]here is no way\n\nI would have done that. I just didn’t think it was appropriate.” 4\n\nC.     Pretrial Competency Hearing\n\n       4\n        Moreover, Salnick chose not to pursue a voluntary intoxication defense in the guilt phase\nbecause Pooler told Salnick he did “not want a defense that is going to admit that he committed\nthe crime.”\n\n\n                                               7\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 8 of 58\n\n      In November 1995, the state trial court held a hearing to determine whether\n\nPooler was competent to stand trial. The state trial court appointed clinical\n\nneuropsychologist Dr. Laurence S. Levine and psychiatrist Dr. Norman\n\nSilversmith to examine Pooler and testify at the competency hearing.\n\n      Dr. Levine examined Pooler for six hours. Dr. Levine interviewed Pooler,\n\nadministered a number of neuropsychological tests, and reviewed Pooler’s jail\n\nmedical records and arrest record. Among the tests Dr. Levine administered was\n\nthe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (“WAIS-R”). Pooler’s overall\n\nscore was 80, which was at the bottom of the low-average range. Dr. Levine found\n\nno evidence of malingering.\n\n      Dr. Levine found Pooler overall to be competent. Dr. Levine also found that\n\nPooler “would be expected to have some difficulties,” though not insurmountable\n\nones, in helping his counsel to plan his defense and to challenge the State’s\n\nwitnesses. Pooler’s attention functioning “was not terribly impaired but it was not\n\noptimum.” Additionally, Pooler’s vocabulary and reading ability were “far lower\n\nthan the average range.” Thus, Pooler would “require somewhat more support and\n\nmore explanation.” Nevertheless, Dr. Levine opined that Pooler “was a fine\n\nsubject,” “listened carefully to [Levine’s] explanation of the evaluation,” and\n\n“responded very appropriately and intelligently with regard to protecting [his]\n\nconfidential [legal documents].”\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012     Page: 9 of 58\n\n      Dr. Levine believed it possible that Pooler had hypothyroidism and\n\npsychomotor retardation, which could affect his ability to assist counsel. Dr.\n\nLevine recommended that his attorney take time to help explain complex legal\n\nissues to Pooler and use simple language in doing so.\n\n      Pooler reported no prior psychiatric treatment to Dr. Levine. All Dr. Levine\n\ncould find in the records he reviewed was treatment for depression following\n\nPooler’s arrest for Brown’s murder.\n\n      Psychiatrist Dr. Norman Silversmith, the second expert to testify at the\n\ncompetency hearing, examined Pooler for about an hour. Dr. Silversmith\n\ninterviewed Pooler but “did not run any standard clinical psychological tests.” Dr.\n\nSilversmith’s questioning of Pooler included “background information, marital\n\nstatus, school history, work histories, and . . . medical history.”\n\n      Pooler appeared to have no difficulty understanding Dr. Silversmith, had an\n\nintact memory, and was not delusional or confused. Pooler’s psychological\n\nfunctioning was within normal limits.\n\n      Dr. Silversmith opined that Pooler was competent to stand trial. Although\n\nthe purpose of Dr. Silversmith’s evaluation of Pooler was competency and not “to\n\nmake a diagnostic impression determination,” he nevertheless felt “there was no\n\nquestion that there was a personality or character disorder” present, though he “did\n\nnot specify whether it would be antisocial or passive dependent.” Dr. Silversmith\n\n\n                                           9\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 10 of 58\n\n“also indicated that [Pooler had] a mental disorder non-psychotic, unspecified.”\n\nDr. Silversmith allowed, though, that “incarceration in and of itself contributes to\n\nmental or emotional issues, so it’s an unspecified mental disorder.” Dr.\n\nSilversmith did not make a definitive diagnosis, but he believed Pooler was\n\ncertainly suffering anxiety and “a certain degree of depression,” which “could\n\ncertainly have suggested an adjustment disorder, adjacent with incarceration.” Dr.\n\nSilversmith’s report noted that Pooler did not “appear to be suffering from any\n\novert mental illness or mental retardation.”\n\n      At the conclusion of the competency hearing, the state trial court found that\n\nPooler was competent to stand trial.\n\nD.    Guilt Phase\n\n      The guilt phase of Pooler’s trial lasted from January 9 to 17, 1996. The\n\nState called victim Alvonza Colson, who described Pooler’s shooting him,\n\nmurdering his sister, and the burglary. Colson identified Pooler as the perpetrator.\n\nThe State also called witnesses who testified, among other things, that: (1) a week\n\nbefore the murder, Pooler told one of Brown’s neighbors that he would kill Brown\n\nbecause he loved her and, if he could not have her, no one else would; (2)\n\nbystanders, who knew Pooler, saw him shoot Brown while she begged for her life\n\nand heard Pooler yell at Brown while he was doing so, “Bitch, didn’t I tell you I\n\n[would] kill you?”; (3) Pooler shot Brown and she fell, at which point he turned\n\n\n                                          10\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 11 of 58\n\nher over, asked if she “want[ed] some more,” and shot her in the head; (4) after\n\nPooler shot Brown, he kicked her body before getting in his car and driving away;\n\nand (5) none of Brown’s five gunshot wounds were immediately fatal.\n\n        The jury convicted Pooler of the first-degree murder of Brown, the\n\nattempted first-degree murder of Colson, and the burglary of Brown and Colson’s\n\nhome.\n\nE.      Penalty Phase: Defense’s Mental Health Testimony in Mitigation\n\n        The penalty phase ran from February 2 to 8, 1996. The State put forth no\n\nevidence, resting upon the guilt-phase evidence. The defense called, as mitigation\n\nwitnesses, mental health experts and lay witnesses. The defense wanted to show\n\nthat Pooler had low intelligence and mental health disturbances and problems, but\n\nyet had worked hard and served in the military, including in Vietnam, and should\n\nhave his life spared.\n\n        Neuropsychologist Dr. Levine first testified that he was appointed by the\n\nstate trial court to evaluate Pooler’s competency. Dr. Levine described the\n\nevaluation, which included assessments of Pooler’s intelligence and cognitive\n\nfunctioning. Pooler’s cognitive functioning was “in the low average to mildly\n\nimpaired range.” Pooler’s performance IQ results ranged from about 75 to 85.\n\nLow average is 80 to 89, and borderline retarded is 70 to 79.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f               Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 12 of 58\n\n      On the WAIS-R intelligence test, Pooler’s scores were 81 for verbal IQ, a 79\n\nfor performance IQ, and a full-scale IQ of 80. Pooler’s scores put him “right on\n\nthe cusp of the low average to the borderline range.” Pooler scored in the\n\nborderline range on four of nine WAIS-R subtests. Pooler’s reading ability, which\n\nwas at the third-grade level, “was dramatically impaired.”\n\n      Pooler shared with Dr. Levine portions of his educational, military, and job\n\nhistory. Pooler told him that Pooler graduated from high school, served in the\n\nmilitary and achieved the rank of sergeant, and held down a job for an extended\n\nperiod of time. To Dr. Levine, this suggested Pooler’s intelligence should be in the\n\naverage range, not low average to borderline, but Dr. Levine found that all of\n\nPooler’s test results were internally consistent, and there was no evidence of\n\nmalingering.\n\n      Dr. Levine also talked about Pooler’s mental health. Dr. Levine learned\n\nfrom the jail’s medical records that Pooler, after his arrest, “had a significant\n\nemotional reaction to whatever it was that was going on.” Pooler “had pretty much\n\nresolved his mental health issues” by the time Dr. Levine examined him. Dr.\n\nLevine noted, though, that Pooler appeared to be “experiencing some depressive\n\nsymptoms.” Dr. Levine’s “clinical impression” was that Pooler had some\n\nsymptoms of depression but “did not meet the criteria for a [depression]\n\ndiagnosis.”\n\n\n                                           12\n\f              Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 13 of 58\n\n       In mitigation, the defense next called psychologist Steve Alexander. Dr.\n\nAlexander, also appointed by the court, had evaluated Pooler’s competency, too. 5\n\nDr. Alexander concluded that Pooler was not competent to stand trial.\n\n       Dr. Alexander admitted that Pooler’s ability to appreciate the criminality of\n\nhis conduct, or to conform his conduct to the law’s requirements, was not\n\nimpaired. Dr. Alexander saw no signs of “any long-term mental illness, or\n\npersonality disorder or disturbance that would have been existing at the time of the\n\nshooting.”\n\n       However, Dr. Alexander believed Pooler was not competent because he did\n\nnot fully understand the current legal proceedings. Other inmates were telling\n\nPooler incorrect information and Pooler “was grossly misinformed for what\n\nappropriate court procedure was and what role he would take in trial.” Thus,\n\nPooler “would totally misunderstand the proceedings as they were unfolding, and\n\ndue to misunderstandings and misperceptions maybe even be disruptive.”\n\n       Although Dr. Alexander found it “clear in talking to [Pooler that] he’s a man\n\nof relatively limited intelligence,” he did not need to administer an IQ test because\n\nPooler was “not so mentally deficient or retarded that that was the basis of an\n\n\n\n       5\n         The record does not reveal when Dr. Alexander was appointed or why he did not testify\nat the pretrial competency hearing. Salnick did not call Dr. Silversmith, who testified at the\ncompetency hearing that Pooler was competent.\n\n\n                                              13\n\f                Case: 12-12059   Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 14 of 58\n\nincompetency.” Dr. Alexander estimated Pooler’s IQ was between 75 and 85,\n\nwhich was “in the lower low average range . . . or the upper end of a borderline.”\n\n      According to Dr. Alexander, Pooler was gullible and displayed “some gross\n\nmisperceptions about the legal system and the way it worked.” Pooler’s\n\nincompetence to stand trial was not caused by a mental illness, defect, or disease,\n\n“but instead was just a real lack of understanding [and] basically distrust, given his\n\nsituation, . . . being fearful, not knowing who to believe, and then erroneously,\n\ngiven his . . . limitations, erroneously placing value and importance on the opinions\n\nof other inmates rather than on his attorney.”\n\n      In mitigation, the defense also called psychiatrist Jude Desormeau, who\n\ntestified about Pooler’s depression, his being on suicide watch in the jail, and being\n\nin the jail’s mental health unit receiving treatment. Dr. Desormeau examined\n\nPooler in February 1995 after he was referred by the psychiatric nurse at the jail.\n\nPooler was depressed and anxious and had spoken of harming himself, so he was\n\nplaced on suicide watch.\n\n      Dr. Desormeau concluded Pooler was suffering from “an adjustment\n\ndisorder with mixed features,” making Pooler “very depressed and very anxious\n\nand tearful.” Dr. Desormeau prescribed a tranquilizer. After seven to ten days,\n\nPooler stabilized and was sent to a different doctor. Pooler was then taken off the\n\ntranquilizer.\n\n\n                                          14\n\f               Case: 12-12059   Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 15 of 58\n\n      Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Armstrong, a staff psychiatrist at the jail, also\n\ntestified about Pooler’s depression and adjustment disorder. Dr. Armstrong saw\n\nPooler before he was discharged from the jail’s mental health unit into the general\n\npopulation. Pooler was in Dr. Armstrong’s mental health transitional unit for\n\nabout two weeks. At first, Pooler reported both that he was depressed and that he\n\nheard a voice calling his name, which began when he came to the jail. By the end\n\nof his stay, Pooler “was functioning very well and was ready for the general\n\npopulation.”\n\nF.    Penalty Phase: Defense’s Lay Witnesses\n\n      In mitigation, the defense also called Arthur Rock, a deputy sheriff at the\n\njail, who testified Pooler was “a well-behaved inmate.” Rock reviewed Pooler’s\n\nyear-long jail file and reported that Pooler had received only one disciplinary\n\nwrite-up that year, with no indication of violence in the incident.\n\n      As for Pooler’s long-term employment, co-worker Alice Bradford testified\n\nthat she worked with Pooler at the moving company for the seven years Pooler was\n\nemployed there. Pooler was reliable and punctual.\n\n      Bradford came to know Pooler outside of work because Pooler would help\n\nBradford, who was a single parent, with yard work. Bradford trusted Pooler in her\n\nhome, and he never did anything inappropriate there. Bradford trusted Pooler\n\naround her son. Pooler was very nice, polite, and respectful whenever Bradford\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 16 of 58\n\nsaw him. Bradford believed Pooler to have fairly good intelligence, but the work\n\nhe performed for her was uncomplicated, menial labor.\n\n      In mitigation, the defense also called Pooler’s family members to testify,\n\nspecifically his brother, sister, and father. Pooler’s brother Henry testified that\n\nwhen he and Pooler grew up, their family was close. The Poolers were a religious\n\nfamily. The family was very supportive of Henry and Pooler. Henry was still\n\nclose to Pooler and spoke to him on the phone often. Henry said that he could not\n\nask for a better brother, because Pooler was so “free-hearted.”\n\n      Pooler had four daughters. When they were growing up, Pooler provided for\n\nthem, took care of them, made sure they went to school, and took them to church.\n\n      Henry and Pooler went to school in the 1960s, in segregated schools. Pooler\n\nwas a pretty good student in high school, as he had to maintain a C average to play\n\non the basketball team.\n\n      According to brother Henry, Pooler served more than six years in the United\n\nStates Marine Corps, including service in Vietnam. Pooler initially served six\n\nmonths in the active reserve, then re-enlisted for six years. After Pooler returned\n\nfrom Vietnam, he “looked like he was off a little bit.” Pooler had a bad temper\n\nwhen he returned.\n\n      Pooler’s sister Carolyn testified that she and Pooler got along well when\n\nthey were growing up, though it had been awhile since she had seen him. Pooler\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 17 of 58\n\n“was more like a father figure” to Carolyn, watching over her and taking care of\n\nher.\n\n       Pooler’s family were members of the Baptist Church, and they didn’t have\n\ntrouble getting along with one another “like most families will.” They were “there\n\nfor one another, help[ed] one another, whatever the situation may be.”\n\n       According to sister Carolyn, Pooler was a “very good father” and a “good\n\nprovider” for his daughters. Pooler was baptized, prayed a lot, and was “a good\n\nperson.” Carolyn exhorted the jury to “talk to God before you come up with a\n\ndecision to pass onto Leroy,” because she felt Pooler was worthy of “another\n\nchance” at God’s forgiveness.\n\n       Pooler’s father Henry Pooler, Sr., also testified. Pooler’s father “raised\n\n[Pooler] as far as [he] could,” and Pooler had never given his father any trouble.\n\nPooler’s father told the jury that he loved Pooler and did the best he could for\n\nPooler and his other children.\n\nG.     Penalty Phase Closing Argument\n\n       In his closing argument, defense counsel Salnick argued, among other\n\nthings, that he put on the mental health experts to show Pooler had borderline\n\nintelligence and some mental health problems. To show reliability of the mental\n\nhealth testimony, Salnick emphasized that Dr. Levine and Dr. Alexander both were\n\ncourt-appointed. Salnick discussed the doctors’ findings and argued that the jury\n\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 18 of 58\n\ncould “take into account a mental disturbance, infirmity, problem, intellectual\n\nabilities.” Salnick argued that when the mental health evidence is combined, it\n\nsuggests a life imprisonment sentence is appropriate:\n\n      Now, if you start adding those things up and you start with what\n      happened with the suicide watch and the depression, and then you\n      have a doctor that didn’t find him incompetent but found him\n      borderline in terms of his intelligence, and you have a doctor who\n      found him incompetent, that tells you that there’s some problem here.\n      And I would suggest that from that evidence this problem translates\n      that Leroy Pooler needs the rest of his life in prison, but not to take his\n      life, not here, not here, not in this circumstance.\n\n      Salnick pointed out that Pooler was “a 47 year old man with a first grade\n\nword level, a third grade reading level.” Pooler grew up in segregated schools and\n\ndid not “get the full benefit of a high school education.” Pooler’s family members\n\nconfirmed that, after he returned from Vietnam, “he wasn’t the same, he got angry,\n\nhe was different.” That change was significant “because that chain of events\n\nultimately, unfortunately and sadly, gets us right here.”\n\n      Salnick then recounted the testimony about Pooler’s good qualities and\n\nargued that, although Brown’s murder was “totally inappropriate, totally wrong,\n\ntotally offensive,” it nevertheless represented “one morning out of 47 years.”\n\nSalnick said that Pooler was “a simple man,” “not an intellect,” but “a simple man\n\nfrom a hard working background, who for some reason did something way out of\n\nhis character when this event occurred. This is not the type of a man to be put to\n\ndeath.”\n                                          18\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 19 of 58\n\nH.     Jury Recommendation, Sentencing, and Direct Appeal\n\n       The jury recommended death by a nine-to-three vote. The state trial court\n\nsentenced Pooler to death.\n\n       The court found three statutory aggravating factors: (1) a prior violent felony\n\nconviction (the attempted first-degree murder of Colson); (2) the murder occurred\n\nduring the commission of a burglary; and (3) the murder was especially heinous,\n\natrocious, or cruel.\n\n       The state trial court found the statutory mitigating factor that Pooler\n\nmurdered Brown while under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional\n\ndisturbance, but gave that factor little weight. 6\n\n       The state trial court also found the following non-statutory mitigating\n\nfactors: (1) Pooler served honorably in the military; (2) Pooler had a good\n\nemployment record; (3) Pooler was a good parent; (4) Pooler had done specific\n\ngood deeds and had certain good characteristics; and (5) if not given the death\n\npenalty, Pooler could receive only life without parole or consecutive life sentences.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         The state trial court expressly found that the defense had not established certain other\nstatutory mitigating circumstances: (1) Pooler’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his\nconduct or conform to the requirements of the law was not substantially impaired; (2) Pooler did\nnot act under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person; and (3)\nPooler’s age at the time of the murder (47 years old) was not mitigating.\n\n\n                                               19\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012        Page: 20 of 58\n\nThe state trial court gave Pooler’s honorable military service considerable weight\n\nand attached either some or little weight to the other non-statutory mitigators.7\n\n       The state trial court concluded that not only did the statutory aggravating\n\nfactors far outweigh the mitigators, but also that each of the three aggravating\n\nfactors standing alone would have outweighed all the mitigating factors.\n\n       On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed Pooler’s convictions\n\nand death sentence. Pooler I, 704 So. 2d 1375. The United States Supreme Court\n\ndenied Pooler’s certiorari petition. Pooler v. Florida, 525 U.S. 848, 119 S. Ct. 119\n\n(1998).\n\nI.     Rule 3.850 Motion and Supporting Materials\n\n       On September 17, 1999, Pooler filed in the Florida trial court (the “3.850\n\ncourt”) a Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion to vacate his\n\nconvictions and death sentence. Pooler’s 3.850 motion claimed, inter alia, that his\n\ntrial counsel Salnick provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately\n\ninvestigate and present mitigation evidence in the penalty phase.\n\n       Attached to the motion were (1) Pooler’s school and military records, and\n\n(2) declarations from Pooler’s nephews Brian and Darren Warren. Pooler’s school\n\n\n       7\n         The state trial court expressly rejected as non-statutory mitigating factors the following:\n(1) Pooler had a good jail record and could adapt well to prison life; (2) Pooler could be\nrehabilitated; (3) Pooler had low normal intelligence; (4) Pooler had mental health problems; and\n(5) the murder resulted from a heated domestic dispute and Pooler was unlikely to endanger\nothers in the future.\n\n\n                                                20\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 21 of 58\n\nrecords end at 11th grade.8 The school records indicate that Pooler scored 75 on an\n\nIQ test in second grade.\n\n       Pooler’s military records show that he: (1) served as a guard and a rifleman\n\nin the Vietnam War; (2) was disciplined frequently, including for six instances\n\nduring a one-year period of being absent without leave; (3) was punished for using\n\ndisrespectful language to a superior officer and for refusing to obey orders; and (4)\n\nwas found guilty in a special court-martial for unauthorized absences and\n\nsentenced to a reduction in pay grade and two months’ confinement with hard\n\nlabor.9 Pooler received three basic service medals: the National Defense Service\n\nMedal, the Vietnamese Service Medal, and the Vietnamese Campaign Medal.\n\n       In their declarations, Pooler’s nephews Brian and Darren Warren discussed\n\nPooler’s emotional problems after returning from Vietnam, his frequent alcohol\n\nabuse, and that he was a good father to his four daughters. Pooler seemed to have\n\nflashbacks to his war experiences; became paranoid, moody, and short-tempered;\n\nand complained that the army “took [his] mind.” Pooler “began to use alcohol to\n\nthe extreme,” and by early 1995, Pooler’s “recreation consisted of hanging out in\n\n\n\n       8\n        The military records indicate that Pooler completed two years of high school and left\nwithout graduating.\n       9\n        Pooler also received a bad conduct discharge, which the U.S. Navy Court of Military\nReview reversed on appeal. Pooler ultimately was released from active duty “under honorable\nconditions.”\n\n\n                                               21\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 22 of 58\n\nthe parking lot near [victim Brown’s] apartment and drinking large amounts of . . .\n\nbeer and hard liquor.” But Pooler loved his daughters, tried to be a good father to\n\nthem, and was involved in their lives.\n\nJ.     3.850 Evidentiary Hearing\n\n       At the 3.850 evidentiary hearing, Pooler called four witnesses: trial counsel\n\nSalnick, his investigator Jenne, Detective Francisco Alonso, and psychologist\n\nMichael Brannon. 10\n\n       Salnick testified about his pretrial mitigation investigation. Salnick “had no\n\nproblem communicating with Mr. Pooler,” whom he characterized as “articulate.”\n\nSalnick stated that “Pooler may not have been a [Rhodes] scholar but he was\n\nextremely street smart, savvy, and understood exactly what was going on.” Pooler\n\nhad “specific recollection of things just prior to the homicide.”\n\n       Salnick initially had some concerns about whether Pooler was competent,\n\nand said, “in a case involving the death penalty you want to look at everything to\n\nmake sure your client is okay mentally.” Nevertheless, Salnick explained:\n\n\n       10\n         The 3.850 court conducted proceedings on Pooler’s competency. Pooler’s 3.850\ncounsel stated that he (1) “had difficulties in obtaining information from Mr. Pooler, such as\nemployment history, military history, and educational background,” and (2) the information on\nsuch subjects that counsel obtained from other sources was “inconsistent at best [with] material\ngathered from Pooler himself.”\n       The 3.850 court appointed mental health experts Dr. John Spencer and Dr. Michael\nBrannon to examine Pooler’s competency. Both Dr. Spencer and Dr. Brannon found Pooler\ncompetent, and after a competency hearing, the 3.850 court found Pooler was competent. Dr.\nSpencer died shortly before the evidentiary hearing.\n\n\n                                               22\n\f              Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 23 of 58\n\n        I was convinced that Mr. Pooler knew what was going on, and that\n        Mr. Pooler was capable of relaying facts to me, Mr. Pooler[] was\n        capable of sharing with me information. He had no trouble giving us\n        witnesses[’] names, even on the eve of trial he came up with\n        something, and you go through that information and you, as an\n        attorney, you have to sort out what you are going to use and what you\n        are not going to use.\n\n        Salnick noted that mental health issues are common in penalty phase trials.\n\nA penalty phase investigation generally includes a mental health evaluation,\n\nalthough it depends on the case. Salnick explained that “every attorney\n\n[investigates a client’s psychological background in] different ways,” and that\n\n“[s]ometimes you use competency experts, if you need[] them[,] for Phase II;\n\nsometimes you hire new experts.”\n\n        Salnick testified that there were “a bunch” of strategic reasons for not hiring\n\nhis own mental health experts to testify at Pooler’s penalty phase, and instead\n\nchoosing to call the court-appointed competency experts and the jail personnel.\n\nFor example, the court-appointed experts had credibility because they supported\n\nthe defense’s position in the penalty phase and were not being paid by the defense\n\nteam.\n\n        Salnick did not hire new doctors to do a penalty phase psychological workup\n\non Pooler because of what he already had gathered. Salnick said, “We had the\n\ncompetency doctors, we had Dr. Desormeau, we had Dr. Armstrong, we had\n\nfamily members, we had a jail employee, we had a co-worker from his\n\n\n                                           23\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 24 of 58\n\nemployment and we made a strategic decision as to how we were going to proceed\n\nwith Phase II.”\n\n      Salnick testified that he and Jenne tried to get Pooler’s military records, but\n\nwere unsuccessful. And in any event, had they obtained and presented the military\n\nrecords, it “would have backfired” because Salnick had seen a portion of Pooler’s\n\nmilitary records in the 3.850 case and “it talks about AWOL, and hitting people,\n\nand talks about [Pooler having] not such a stel[l]ar career in the military.” Those\n\nthings were inconsistent with what the defense was trying to show in the penalty\n\nphase, which was that Pooler served his country honorably in Vietnam.\n\n      Salnick had argued to the jury that Pooler had a good military record\n\n“[b]ased exactly on what [Pooler] told [Salnick].” Salnick explained:\n\n      If my client tells me that information and my investigator, who I\n      believe went to Louisiana for a period of time, and that’s corroborated\n      by a relative, it seems to me that is consistent with our strategy to\n      show that this incident was the product of a man who for 15 years had\n      not been arrested, lived a good life and served our country. That was\n      certainly what we decided, and based on it at the time it was certainly\n      reasonable.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n      Salnick learned later that what Pooler told Salnick before trial, and what his\n\nrelatives confirmed—Pooler graduated from high school—was not true. But\n\nSalnick testified that because his client told him something and his client’s\n\nrelatives backed it up, it was “extremely reasonable” to present it to the jury.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 25 of 58\n\nSalnick “had no reason to disbelieve” his client. Salnick reiterated that although\n\nJenne tried to get the military records, “with Mr. Pooler telling us that he had been\n\nin the service and was honorably discharged, with his brother corroborating that,\n\nwe didn’t need any more at that point.”\n\n      Salnick was aware of the notion that in a penalty phase trial it can be helpful\n\nto present evidence of bad circumstances from the defendant’s life so that “perhaps\n\nthe jury may opt to be forgiving and spare his or her life.” Salnick believed that in\n\n“some cases that’s a very good strategy depending upon the information that you\n\nhave.” And in some cases, there are no significant positive aspects of the\n\ndefendant’s life to present. But in Pooler’s case, Salnick had positive evidence,\n\nand decided “as a matter of strategy” to present a positive story of Pooler’s life:\n\n      We had an individual . . . [who] served his country in Vietnam, re-\n      upped, raised his daughter[s], always took care of them . . . . His\n      brother Henry said how he was a good parent, worked, he had a job,\n      graduated from high school, and how he was honorably discharged,\n      how he did live his good life. . . . Those are the types of things that\n      we thought would be better, so that’s—granted, when he was young\n      he had a criminal record but he had 15 years of living, you know, a\n      hard-working productive life; he had one job, I think, for eight years.\n      This is a guy who on that particular day was not the person that he had\n      been for 15 years, and we felt that as a matter of strategy, and a matter\n      of tactic, that’s what we wanted to present to the jury. You convicted\n      him. Now let’s look at this: He served his country, worked, and took\n      care of his 79-year-old father.\n\n      Although during his pretrial investigation Salnick had discovered evidence\n\nthat Pooler had a bad temper, a violent background, and had been known to argue\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 26 of 58\n\nwith people and carry a gun, Salnick “certainly didn’t want that to come in” during\n\nthe penalty phase, for Salnick’s plan was “to show the human being that [Pooler]\n\nwas and could still be if [his] life was spared.”\n\n      Salnick’s investigator Marvin Jenne also described the pretrial investigation.\n\nJenne and Pooler “got along pretty good all the time” and “had a good personal\n\nworking relationship.” Jenne tried to corroborate all the background information\n\nhe received from Pooler by talking with other persons.\n\n      Pooler’s 3.850 counsel also called West Palm Beach Police Detective\n\nFrancisco Alonso, who testified that on the day of Brown’s murder, at 6:30 a.m.,\n\nhe took a report from Pooler that $301 had been stolen from his wallet. Pooler said\n\nhe was sitting in his car with a girlfriend’s friend, fell asleep, and awoke to find his\n\nwallet missing.\n\n      Although Detective Alonso’s report stated that Pooler had fallen asleep from\n\nintoxication before the alleged theft at 3:00 a.m., when Pooler arrived to make the\n\nreport, he did not appear drunk. Pooler “smelled like he [had been] drinking,\n\nsmelled like alcohol but he was coherent, he wasn’t slurring his speech, he was\n\nattentive, and [he] gave [Detective Alonso] the exact . . . amount of $301.”\n\nDetective Alonso saw Pooler drive away from the police station, and would not\n\nhave let him drive if he had thought Pooler was still intoxicated.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 27 of 58\n\n      Psychologist Dr. Michael Brannon, Pooler’s final 3.850 witness, evaluated\n\nPooler and administered an intelligence test. Pooler received an IQ score of 75,\n\nwhich put him in the borderline range. Dr. Brannon found that Pooler was\n\ncompetent to proceed. Dr. Brannon believed that, in his self-reporting of his\n\nbackground, Pooler was confabulating—that is, not outright lying but filling in the\n\ngaps in one’s memory with inaccurate information.\n\n      Dr. Brannon believed Pooler “had a severe alcohol problem,” a “high\n\nprobability of severe substance dependency,” and alcohol dependency disorders.\n\nDr. Brannon summarized his areas of concern: (1) Pooler’s IQ, which fell in the\n\nborderline range based on current and past testing; (2) Pooler’s neuro-\n\npsychological deficits, as shown in Dr. Levine’s report; (3) Pooler’s alcohol\n\ndependence and abuse; and (4) the possibility, which more investigation would be\n\nneeded to confirm, that Pooler had post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) from\n\nVietnam. Pooler “certainly shows extreme traumatic stress-like reactions,” but Dr.\n\nBrannon did not know whether they rose to the level of PTSD.\n\nK.    3.850 Court’s Denial of Pooler’s 3.850 Motion\n\n      The 3.850 court denied Pooler’s 3.850 motion. The 3.850 court found that\n\nSalnick conducted a reasonable investigation and that Salnick’s strategy at the\n\npenalty phase was “to present the defendant in a positive light, that he had been a\n\nproductive member of society.” This strategy was “in direct contrast” with\n\n\n                                         27\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 28 of 58\n\nPooler’s 3.850 contention that the defense should have offered less-flattering-to-\n\nPooler evidence at the penalty phase, but “[m]ere disagreement with trial strategy\n\ndoes not amount to a basis for postconviction relief.”\n\n      The 3.850 court concluded, “It is clear from the evidence presented that trial\n\ncounsel conducted a reasonable investigation, and when written documentation\n\nwas not available, [an] alternate means of corroboration was found (i.e., family\n\nmembers).” In light of Salnick’s investigation and chosen penalty-phase strategy,\n\nand “given the corroboration obtained from family members, the failure to obtain\n\n[Pooler’s] military and employment records was not prejudicial.”\n\n      As to the mental health experts, the 3.850 court observed that Salnick “opted\n\nto present the testimony” of the experts, Drs. Levine, Desormeau, Armstrong, and\n\nAlexander, who evaluated Pooler “for competency purposes and mental health\n\nissues for the court and in the jail.” Moreover, “information regarding [Pooler’s]\n\nschool, military and employment history was given to the mental health experts,”\n\nand “jail and medical records as well as the fact that there was no prior report of\n\npsychiatric treatment were given to the experts.” The 3.850 court found that\n\nPooler “failed to meet his burden under Strickland.”\n\n      As to Salnick’s not presenting intoxication evidence, the 3.850 court noted\n\nthat: (1) Salnick successfully used evidence of Pooler’s intoxication a week before\n\nthe murder, when Pooler threatened Brown in his statement to witness Carolyn\n\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 29 of 58\n\nGlass, to preclude the State from obtaining an instruction on the cold, calculated,\n\nand premeditated (“CCP”) aggravating circumstance; (2) Salnick reviewed and\n\ndiscussed with Pooler the contents of Detective Alonso’s police report regarding\n\nthe theft of money from Pooler a few hours before the murder, which stated that\n\nPooler fell asleep from intoxication at 3:00 a.m.; (3) the murder occurred between\n\n8:00 and 9:00 a.m., five to six hours after Pooler fell asleep and about two hours\n\nafter Pooler reported the theft to Detective Alonso; (4) the police report did not\n\nindicate Pooler was drunk when he filed the report; (5) Pooler could recall specific\n\ndetails about the day of the murder; and (6) Salnick was aware of the possibility of\n\npresenting evidence of intoxication but decided not to do so. The 3.850 court also\n\npointed out Detective Alonso’s testimony that Pooler did not appear impaired\n\nwhile filing the report and Detective Alonso knowingly permitted Pooler to drive\n\naway from the police station.\n\n      In sum, the 3.850 court found that Pooler had failed “to prove that trial\n\ncounsel did not properly investigate mitigating factors to present to the court and\n\nthe jury” at the penalty phase. The 3.850 court stated:\n\n      After applying the “highly deferential” scrutiny to counsel’s strategic\n      decisions as required by Strickland, the court finds that the defendant\n      has failed to prove that his attorney’s representation fell below an\n      objective standard of reasonableness and that there was a reasonable\n      probability that the results of the proceeding would have been\n      different but for counsel’s strategic decisions.\n\nL.    3.850 Appeal\n\n                                          29\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 30 of 58\n\n      Pooler appealed the denial of his 3.850 motion to the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt, which affirmed. Pooler v. State, 980 So. 2d 460 (Fla. 2008) (“Pooler II”).\n\n      The Florida Supreme Court divided Pooler’s penalty phase ineffective\n\ncounsel claim into three sub-parts: (1) failure to investigate and present evidence of\n\nPooler’s alcohol abuse or dependency; (2) failure to investigate and present\n\nPooler’s school, military, and employment records; and (3) failure to retain mental\n\nhealth experts and provide them with adequate background information. Id. at 464.\n\n      As to alcohol abuse or dependency, the Florida Supreme Court concluded\n\nthat Pooler had not shown either deficient performance or prejudice:\n\n      First, Salnick’s performance was not deficient. . . . Salnick conducted\n      a reasonable investigation into Pooler’s background. Neither Pooler\n      nor his family indicated to Salnick that he had a substance abuse\n      problem or that he had been drinking at the time of the shooting.\n      However, Salnick discovered that Pooler had been drinking two days\n      before the murder when he threatened to kill Kim Brown. He used this\n      information during the penalty phase to prevent the State from\n      obtaining an instruction on CCP. Further, Salnick testified at the\n      evidentiary hearing that he chose not to introduce Pooler’s police\n      report during the penalty phase because it would open the door for the\n      State to cross-examine Pooler regarding the fact that he had been with\n      a prostitute when he passed out drunk and that she stole his money.\n      This was a reasonable tactical decision made after a reasonable\n      investigation; therefore, Salnick’s performance was not deficient.\n      Moreover, . . . none of the evidence introduced by Pooler at the\n      evidentiary hearing shows that he was intoxicated at the time of the\n      murder. Therefore, any alleged failure on Salnick’s part to investigate\n      and present it at trial was not prejudicial.\n\nId. at 466-67 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 31 of 58\n\n      As to the school, military, and employment records, the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that Salnick’s pre-trial investigation was reasonable given that\n\nPooler’s family members corroborated what Pooler self-reported on these subjects:\n\n      Salnick conducted a reasonable investigation. His failure to obtain\n      Pooler’s records does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance.\n      Pooler consistently represented to Salnick that he was an average\n      student, graduated from high school, and was honorably discharged\n      from the Marine Corps. To test the validity of Pooler’s\n      representations, Salnick’s investigator, Marvin Jenne, traveled to\n      Louisiana and interviewed members of Pooler’s family. All of the\n      family members Jenne located and interviewed corroborated Pooler’s\n      positive representations. Further, Jenne made an attempt, albeit\n      unsuccessful, to obtain Pooler’s school records. Based on Pooler’s\n      positive representations of himself which were substantiated by his\n      family members, Salnick had no reason to believe Pooler’s records\n      would contain anything negative or mitigating. Therefore, he formed a\n      reasonable trial strategy of presenting Pooler in a positive light.\n\nId. at 467 (citation omitted). Thus, Pooler did not satisfy the deficient performance\n\nprong of the ineffective assistance test. Id.\n\n      The Florida Supreme Court also found that Pooler failed to show prejudice\n\ngiven the mitigating evidence Salnick did introduce, Salnick’s trial strategy, and\n\nthat the additional evidence in these records was a double-edged sword and would\n\nhave undermined Pooler’s other mitigating evidence:\n\n      Moreover, no prejudice resulted from counsel’s choice of strategy. At\n      trial, Salnick showed that Pooler had been a productive member of\n      society and crime-free for fifteen years prior to the murder. He\n      presented evidence that Pooler had served honorably in the military in\n      Vietnam, reenlisted, raised a daughter, took care of his relatives, was a\n      good parent, worked at the same job for eight years, and was well\n      liked by his coworkers. Of all the mitigation presented, the trial court\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 32 of 58\n\n      gave considerable weight only to Pooler’s honorable military service.\n      Had Salnick introduced Pooler’s military, school, or employment\n      records, he would have undermined Pooler’s only significant\n      mitigation. See Reed v. State, 875 So.2d 415, 437 (Fla. 2004) (“An\n      ineffective assistance claim does not arise from the failure to present\n      mitigation evidence where that evidence presents a double-edged\n      sword.”). Furthermore, Pooler’s records would not have opened up\n      mitigation leads sufficient to overcome the aggravation found by the\n      trial court. Accordingly, counsel’s failure to obtain these records does\n      not undermine confidence in Pooler’s death sentence.\n\nId. at 467–68.\n\n      The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the 3.850 court’s denial of Pooler’s\n\nclaim about the mental health experts. Id. at 469. The Florida Supreme Court\n\nconcluded that Salnick’s performance was reasonable:\n\n      Salnick reasonably relied on Pooler’s corroborated representations\n      regarding his scholastic and military background. Salnick\n      communicated this information to the experts, and Pooler also gave\n      the experts the same information during their evaluations of him.\n      Furthermore, Salnick testified at the evidentiary hearing that he\n      retained these experts because, given their neutrality, they would be\n      more credible and difficult to impeach. This was a reasonable\n      strategic decision.\n\nId. (citation omitted). The Florida Supreme Court also concluded that, even\n\nassuming Salnick’s performance were deficient, Pooler did not show prejudice:\n\n      Even if we assume counsel’s decision to forego further testing\n      constituted deficient performance, Pooler failed to establish that any\n      prejudice resulted from it. He presented no evidence that the defense\n      experts were incompetent or that they failed to assist in the evaluation,\n      preparation, and presentation of the defense. Nor did Pooler identify\n      anything of substance that a more in-depth psychoanalysis would have\n      added. [3.850 expert] Dr. Brannon’s finding that Pooler had\n      neurological damage from head injuries was already indicated in Dr.\n                                         32\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 33 of 58\n\n      Levine’s evaluation. Also, Dr. Brannon’s determination that Pooler\n      had a borderline retarded IQ of 75 does not constitute a clear\n      indication of actual mental retardation because it is within the range\n      estimated by Dr. Alexander and is not substantially inconsistent with\n      the trial court’s finding that Pooler had an IQ of 80. Furthermore,\n      because Pooler did not call any of his trial experts to testify at his\n      postconviction hearing, he failed to demonstrate that they would have\n      changed their opinions had they conducted more in-depth\n      psychological evaluations or been provided with his records. Under\n      these circumstances, a new sentencing proceeding is not mandated.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n      The United States Supreme Court denied Pooler’s certiorari petition. Pooler\n\nv. Florida, 555 U.S. 911, 129 S. Ct. 255 (2008).\n\nM.    Federal Habeas Proceedings\n\n      In May 2008, Pooler filed his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 federal habeas petition,\n\nwhich was denied. The district court concluded, inter alia, that the Florida\n\nSupreme Court’s decision affirming the 3.850 court’s denial of Pooler’s penalty-\n\nphase ineffective counsel claim was not unreasonable, but granted a certificate of\n\nappealability (“COA”) on that claim. Pooler appealed.\n\n                           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      Section 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n\nAct of 1996 (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, provides that\n\nfederal courts may not grant a writ of habeas corpus to a state court prisoner on any\n\nclaim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court’s decision “was\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n                                         33\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 34 of 58\n\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” or “was based on\n\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n\nState court proceeding.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d); see Trepal v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of\n\nCorr., 684 F.3d 1088, 1107 (11th Cir. 2012). Thus, AEDPA “imposes a highly\n\ndeferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings and demands that state-court\n\ndecisions be given the benefit of the doubt.” Trepal, 684 F.3d at 1107 (quoting\n\nHardy v. Cross, 565 U.S. —, —, 132 S. Ct. 490, 491 (2011)).\n\n      “We review de novo the district court’s decision about whether the state\n\ncourt acted contrary to clearly established federal law, unreasonably applied\n\nfederal law, or made an unreasonable determination of fact.” Johnson v. Upton,\n\n615 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\n                                III. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Strickland Test for Ineffective Counsel Claims\n\n      Pooler’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is governed by the Supreme\n\nCourt’s two-pronged test announced in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See Johnson, 615 F.3d at 1330. Under the Strickland test,\n\nfor a convicted defendant to show that he received constitutionally ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, he must show that (1) his attorney’s performance was\n\ndeficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. A court need not “address both components of\n\n\n                                         34\n\f               Case: 12-12059   Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 35 of 58\n\nthe inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.” Id. at 697, 104\n\nS. Ct. 2069.\n\n      The performance standard is “objectively reasonable attorney conduct under\n\nprevailing professional norms.” Johnson, 615 F.3d at 1330; see Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 (“The proper measure of attorney performance\n\nremains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.”). The\n\nquestion is “whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or\n\nomissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.”\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. In answering this question, we\n\nemploy a highly deferential review of counsel’s conduct, for “we must indulge a\n\nstrong presumption that counsel’s performance was reasonable and that counsel\n\nmade all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.”\n\nRhode v. Hall, 582 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Newland v. Hall,\n\n527 F.3d 1162, 1184 (11th Cir. 2008)). In short, Pooler “must establish that no\n\ncompetent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.” Id.\n\n(quoting Newland, 527 F.3d at 1184).\n\n      Attorneys have a duty to conduct reasonable pretrial investigations.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690–91, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. The Strickland Court\n\nexplained:\n\n      [S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts\n      relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and\n                                          35\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 36 of 58\n\n      strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are\n      reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n      judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words,\n      counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\n      reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\n      In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate\n      must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,\n      applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments.\n\nId.\n\n      Furthermore, “[t]he reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be determined\n\nor substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions,” for\n\nattorneys—usually, and “quite properly”—base their actions “on information\n\nsupplied by the defendant.” Id. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. “In particular, what\n\ninvestigation decisions are reasonable depends critically” upon information the\n\ndefendant furnishes to his counsel. Id. The Supreme Court in Strickland noted\n\nthat, “when the facts that support a certain potential line of defense are generally\n\nknown to counsel because of what the defendant has said, the need for further\n\ninvestigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether.” Id.\n\nTherefore, “inquiry into counsel’s conversations with the defendant may be critical\n\nto a proper assessment of counsel’s investigation decisions.” Id.\n\n      For prejudice, the standard is whether “there is a reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different.” Rose v. McNeil, 634 F.3d 1224, 1241 (11th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n132 S. Ct. 190 (2011) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068).\n                                          36\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 37 of 58\n\nBecause Pooler alleges ineffective assistance in the penalty phase, he must show\n\nthat “there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer would\n\nhave concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did\n\nnot warrant death.” Id. at 1241–42 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      In assessing prejudice, “we consider the totality of the available mitigation\n\nevidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas\n\nproceeding—and reweigh it against the evidence in aggravation.” Porter v.\n\nMcCollum, 558 U.S. 30, —, 130 S. Ct. 447, 453–54 (2009) (quotation marks and\n\nbrackets omitted). To satisfy the prejudice prong, the “likelihood of a different\n\nresult must be substantial, not just conceivable.” Harrington v. Richter, — U.S. —,\n\n131 S. Ct. 770, 792 (2011). “Counsel’s errors must be so serious as to deprive the\n\ndefendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.” Id. at 787–88 (quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n      Because we must view Pooler’s ineffective counsel claim—which is\n\ngoverned by the deferential Strickland test—through the lens of AEDPA\n\ndeference, the resulting standard of review is “doubly deferential.” Digsby v.\n\nMcNeil, 627 F.3d 823, 831 (11th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2936 (2011);\n\nsee also Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788 (“The standards created by Strickland and §\n\n2254(d) are both ‘highly deferential,’ and when the two apply in tandem, review is\n\n‘doubly’ so.” (citations omitted)). The ultimate question before us is not whether\n\n\n                                           37\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 38 of 58\n\nPooler’s trial counsel Salnick’s actions were reasonable, but whether “there is any\n\nreasonable argument that [Salnick] satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.”\n\nRichter, 131 S. Ct. at 778. If any such reasonable argument exists, then Pooler\n\ncannot prevail.\n\nB.    Performance: Investigation\n\n      Pooler argues that Salnick rendered ineffective assistance during the penalty\n\nphase investigation by relying on Pooler’s own statements about his background\n\nwithout obtaining the school, military, and employment records that would have\n\nshown Pooler’s positive statements about his background and achievements were\n\nuntrue. The Florida Supreme Court rejected this contention and found Salnick’s\n\npenalty-phase preparation was reasonable under the circumstances. Pooler II, 980\n\nSo. 2d at 467. The Florida Supreme Court’s decision is not contrary to, or based\n\non an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. Nor is it based on an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts.\n\n      It was not unreasonable for the Florida Supreme Court to conclude, based on\n\nthe evidence presented at trial and in the 3.850 proceedings, that Salnick’s\n\ninvestigation of mitigating evidence, and his strategic decisions about what\n\nevidence to present in the penalty phase, fell within “the wide range of\n\nprofessionally competent assistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at\n\n2066. The facts show that Salnick, an experienced criminal defense attorney,\n\n\n                                           38\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 39 of 58\n\nretained Jenne, a veteran investigator, to help with the mitigation search, and\n\nSalnick instructed Jenne to find “anything and everything” he could about Pooler.\n\nThe two men began by speaking with Pooler himself, who furnished them with\n\ninformation and with names of witnesses. According to Salnick, Pooler had no\n\ntrouble sharing information, and Jenne thought he and Pooler had a “good personal\n\nworking relationship.”\n\n      Nevertheless, Salnick and Jenne did not simply take Pooler’s information at\n\nface value. They interviewed the witnesses Pooler identified. Jenne testified he\n\nknew that criminal defendants often don’t tell their attorneys and investigators the\n\nfull truth, and he made an effort to corroborate all the information Pooler gave him.\n\n      Importantly, Salnick and Jenne testified that they tried to get these records\n\nPooler claims they should have obtained. Salnick testified they tried to get Pooler’s\n\nmilitary records, but were unsuccessful. Jenne testified that he made telephone\n\ncalls and sent letters requesting Pooler’s school records, but he was told they were\n\nunavailable. Jenne tried to get Pooler’s employment records also, and did get the\n\nones from local employers, but could not obtain the records from Louisiana.\n\n      When Salnick and Jenne could not get the requested records, they sought\n\nalternative corroboration from Pooler’s close relatives, who could reasonably be\n\nexpected to know the details of Pooler’s background. Only after they obtained that\n\ncorroboration did they present the evidence at trial.\n\n\n                                          39\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 40 of 58\n\n      It was not unreasonable, or contrary to Supreme Court precedent, for the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court to find that counsel’s performance as to these records was\n\nnot deficient under Strickland. Salnick and his investigator Jenne did try to get the\n\ncorroborating records, and when they could not, they tried to—and did—obtain\n\nconfirmation through other means. See Housel v. Head, 238 F.3d 1289, 1295–96\n\n(11th Cir. 2001) (counsel’s failure to discover and present evidence of defendant’s\n\npoor, abusive upbringing was not deficient performance because defendant told\n\ncounsel there was nothing traumatic in his upbringing, counsel followed up by\n\ninterviewing defendant’s mother and other witnesses, and mother confirmed that\n\nupbringing was normal); see also Stewart v. Sec’y, Dep’t of Corr., 476 F.3d 1193,\n\n1210–12 (11th Cir. 2007) (attorney’s performance not unreasonable for not\n\nfinding, and providing to expert, evidence of defendant’s childhood abuse because\n\n(1) defendant failed to mention abuse and in fact told attorney “just the opposite,”\n\nand (2) attorney interviewed a number of family members, none of whom\n\nmentioned abuse and all of whom said that defendant’s childhood was\n\n“harmonious and happy” (brackets omitted)); Williams v. Head, 185 F.3d 1223,\n\n1237 (11th Cir. 1999) (attorney’s performance not unreasonable for not finding\n\nevidence of defendant’s childhood abuse and mistreatment where defendant\n\nhimself gave no reason to suspect abuse or mistreatment, and where attorney spoke\n\nto defendant’s mother and “got nothing from her about [the defendant] having been\n\n\n                                         40\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 41 of 58\n\nabused or mistreated”). That the information Pooler gave his counsel—and the\n\nconfirmation supplied by Pooler’s closest relatives—turned out to be false is of no\n\nmoment, for we do not judge counsel’s performance by hindsight. See Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 (“A fair assessment of attorney performance\n\nrequires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to\n\nreconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the\n\nconduct from counsel’s perspective at the time.”). Significantly, Pooler presents\n\nno evidence, other than the fact that his 3.850 counsel obtained the records and\n\ntrial counsel did not, tending to show that the efforts trial counsel actually made to\n\ntry to get the records were unreasonably deficient. See Lambrix v. Singletary, 72\n\nF.3d 1500, 1505–06 (11th Cir. 1996) (rejecting ineffective assistance claim for\n\nfailure to discover evidence of defendant’s childhood abuse and neglect where\n\nthere was “no indication that [defendant or his] relatives gave counsel reason to\n\nbelieve that such evidence might exist” and there was no “documentary evidence\n\nof [defendant’s] abuse or neglect that would have been readily available to counsel\n\nat the time” (emphasis added)).\n\n      As noted above, the reasonableness of an attorney’s investigative decisions\n\n“depends critically” upon information the defendant furnishes to his counsel.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. Moreover, “searching for old\n\nrecords can promise less than looking for a needle in a haystack, when a lawyer\n\n\n                                          41\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012        Page: 42 of 58\n\ntruly has reason to doubt there is any needle there.” Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.\n\n374, 389, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 2467 (2005).\n\n       This is not a case where defense counsel took his client’s word on faith, with\n\nno attempt at confirmation. 11 See, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, —, 130\n\nS. Ct. 447, 452–53 (2009) (concluding penalty-phase counsel performed\n\ndeficiently when he had only one short meeting with defendant about mitigating\n\nevidence; did not interview any family members; did not obtain any school,\n\nmedical, or military records; presented almost no mitigating evidence; and left jury\n\nhardly knowing anything about defendant). Nor is it a case where counsel ignored\n\nevidence in his possession that cast doubt upon his client’s story or suggested the\n\nneed for further investigation. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 527, 123 S.\n\nCt. 2527, 2538 (2003) (stating that “[i]n assessing the reasonableness of an\n\n\n\n       11\n         Even if it were, that does not necessarily mean that the Florida Supreme Court’s\ndecision finding no deficient performance would be unreasonable. See, e.g., Callahan v.\nCampbell, 427 F.3d 897, 934 (11th Cir. 2005) (“Especially when it comes to childhood abuse,\ninformation supplied by a petitioner is extremely important in determining whether a lawyer’s\nperformance is constitutionally adequate. This Court has already stated in no uncertain terms:\n‘An attorney does not render ineffective assistance by failing to discover and develop evidence\nof childhood abuse that his client does not mention to him.’” (citations, quotation marks, and\nbrackets omitted)). Pooler, though, citing Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 377, 125 S. Ct.\n2456, 2460 (2005), contends that “even when the defendant and/or his family suggest that no\nmitigating evidence is available, defense counsel has an absolute duty to investigate.” This\nargument misconstrues (and goes well beyond) the limited holding of Rompilla, which provides\nthat “even when a capital defendant’s family members and the defendant himself have suggested\nthat no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain\nand review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of\naggravation at the sentencing phase of trial.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                                42\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 43 of 58\n\nattorney’s investigation, . . . a court must consider not only the quantum of\n\nevidence already known to counsel, but also whether the known evidence would\n\nlead a reasonable attorney to investigate further,” and finding that “[i]n light of\n\nwhat the . . . records [discovered by counsel] actually revealed, . . . counsel chose\n\nto abandon their investigation at an unreasonable juncture”); Middleton v. Dugger,\n\n849 F.2d 491, 493–94 (11th Cir. 1988) (stating attorney’s performance was\n\ndeficient because he “conducted almost no background investigation, despite\n\ndiscussions with [the defendant] concerning the existence of such mitigating\n\nevidence”).\n\n      Instead, this is “a case, like Strickland itself, in which defense counsel’s\n\n‘decision not to seek more’ mitigating evidence from the defendant’s background\n\n‘than was already in hand’ fell ‘well within the range of professionally reasonable\n\njudgments.’” Johnson v. Upton, 615 F.3d 1318, 1338 (11th Cir. 2010). It was\n\nneither unreasonable nor contrary to existing Supreme Court holdings for the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court to conclude Salnick’s performance was not deficient\n\ndespite not successfully obtaining Pooler’s records to supplement the information\n\ngiven to experts.\n\nC.    Performance: Mental Health Experts\n\n      Pooler also argues that Salnick’s performance was unreasonably deficient\n\nbecause he relied on the court-appointed experts who evaluated Pooler and did not\n\n\n                                          43\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 44 of 58\n\nretain other mental health experts to evaluate Pooler. The record reveals that this\n\nwas a conscious, strategic decision by Salnick, one that the Florida Supreme Court\n\nexpressly found to be reasonable. Pooler II, 980 So. 2d at 469. Salnick testified\n\nthat he had “a bunch” of strategic reasons for choosing to rely, in the penalty\n\nphase, on Dr. Levine and Dr. Alexander, including that they would be more\n\ncredible to the jury because they were hired by the court and not the defense team.\n\nSalnick also said that he did not hire a defense mental health expert to do a\n\nmitigation-related evaluation because of what he already had for the penalty phase.\n\nSalnick believed Dr. Levine’s and Dr. Alexander’s conclusions dovetailed with his\n\nchosen penalty-phase strategy of presenting evidence that would humanize Pooler\n\nand portray him as a man who worked hard, served his country, and was good to\n\nhis family.\n\n      Under the particular circumstances here, it was neither unreasonable nor\n\ncontrary to Supreme Court precedent for the Florida Supreme Court to conclude\n\nthat a reasonable attorney could have decided, as Salnick did, to rely on the two\n\nexperts here. Those circumstances include the facts that: (1) trial counsel was\n\nalready performing a mitigation investigation into Pooler’s background, including\n\nan inquiry into his medical and psychological history; and (2) well before trial,\n\ncounsel read the reports from, and heard the competency-hearing testimony of,\n\nmultiple experts who had evaluated Pooler’s then-current mental functioning. And\n\n\n                                         44\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 45 of 58\n\nmost importantly, nothing in those expert reports during competency proceedings,\n\nor in the additional mitigation search Salnick and Jenne performed, suggested a\n\nneed for mental health experts to look further. See Newland v. Hall, 527 F.3d\n\n1162, 1210–14 (11th Cir. 2008) (finding no deficient performance in counsel’s\n\nfailure to hire independent mental health expert after (1) court-appointed\n\ncompetency experts evaluated defendant and reported he was not suffering from\n\npsychological defect at time of murder, and (2) counsel’s observations of\n\ndefendant showed nothing indicating mental illness). Here, the two experts\n\nadministered neuropsychological and intelligence tests and reported that Pooler\n\nhad: (1) a low-average to borderline intelligence level, with an overall IQ around\n\n80; (2) poor reading ability; (3) sub-optimal attention functioning; (4) no prior\n\npsychiatric treatment except for the treatment for depression after his arrest; (5)\n\npossible hypothyroidism and psychomotor retardation; (6) suffered head trauma 30\n\nyears before in a car accident, but with no cognitive or thinking ability changes\n\nfollowing it; (7) intact memory function, with no delusions or confusion; (8) no\n\nevident symptoms of mental illness; and (9) no signs of long-term mental illness or\n\ndisturbance existing at the time of Brown’s murder. 12 The two experts inquired\n\n\n\n       12\n         Dr. Silversmith believed Pooler had a personality disorder of an unspecified type, either\nantisocial or passive dependent (although Dr. Alexander saw no sign of a personality disorder),\nplus an unspecified, non-psychotic mental disorder to which Pooler’s pretrial incarceration may\nhave contributed. Thus, this also was not unknown to Salnick.\n\n\n                                               45\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 46 of 58\n\nabout Pooler’s history and background, and Dr. Levine in particular spent about\n\neight hours examining Pooler.\n\n      Armed with Dr. Levine’s and Dr. Alexander’s reports of Pooler’s cognitive\n\nfunctioning and emotional state, and added to what Salnick had learned of Pooler’s\n\nbackground (his family life, military service, and regular employment), the Florida\n\nSupreme Court could reasonably conclude that Salnick’s strategic choice—to\n\neschew further mental health evaluations and emphasize Pooler’s positive\n\nqualities—was not constitutionally deficient performance. See Housel, 238 F.3d at\n\n1296 (finding no deficient performance in counsel’s failure to investigate and\n\npresent mental health evidence of brain damage and hypoglycemic irritability\n\nepisodes because (1) counsel reviewed two psychological evaluations that did not\n\nsuggest a need to investigate further, (2) the defendant never mentioned his\n\nhypoglycemia to counsel, (3) counsel knew about defendant’s prior head injury but\n\nsaw nothing unusual in defendant’s behavior, and thus, (4) counsel “knew enough\n\nabout [the defendant’s] mental health reasonably to conclude that further\n\ninvestigation would not bear fruit”); see also Newland, 527 F.3d at 1213–14.\n\nD.    Performance: Alcohol Use\n\n      Pooler also argued that Salnick performed unreasonably because he failed to\n\nfollow up on information about Pooler’s nephew Brian Warren and Pooler’s\n\nalleged use of alcohol on the day of the murder. As to this contention, the Florida\n\n\n                                         46\n\f              Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 47 of 58\n\nSupreme Court decision was likewise reasonable and not contrary to prior holdings\n\nof the United States Supreme Court.\n\n       Regarding Brian Warren, it is undisputed that Salnick and Jenne interviewed\n\na number of Pooler’s relatives, including Pooler’s father, brother, and sister, and\n\nthat Jenne spent three days in Louisiana speaking with persons who knew Pooler.13\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “there comes a point at which evidence\n\nfrom more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and\n\nthe search for it distractive from more important duties.” Bobby v. Van Hook, 558\n\nU.S. 4, —, 130 S. Ct. 13, 19 (2009).\n\n       Regarding Pooler’s alcohol consumption, the record shows that Salnick\n\ninvestigated and was in fact aware of this evidence. Salnick and Jenne interviewed\n\na number of witnesses, including Pooler’s relatives and employers, about Pooler’s\n\nuse of alcohol. Salnick obtained the police report about the theft Pooler reported\n\non the day of the murder—which said Pooler “fell asleep due to intoxication”—\n\n\n\n\n       13\n          Jenne may have spoken with Pooler’s nephew Darren Warren, too. Jenne’s invoice\nshows a phone call placed to Darren Warren on April 25, 1995. However, Darren Warren’s\ndeclaration states that he was never contacted by Pooler’s defense team. Because Darren Warren\ndid not testify at the 3.850 hearing and Jenne was not asked about the phone call, a factual\ndispute remains.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 48 of 58\n\nand spoke to Pooler about it. 14 Pooler told Salnick that the woman who allegedly\n\nrobbed him was a prostitute, and Salnick did not want to open the door to that fact\n\ncoming before the jury, stating that “[t]here is no way I would have done that. I\n\njust didn’t think it was appropriate.”\n\n       More generally, presenting evidence of Pooler’s alcohol use may not have\n\nbeen mitigating in the jury’s eyes, and may well have opened the door not only to\n\nevidence of Pooler’s cavorting with a prostitute hours before he brutally killed his\n\nex-girlfriend, but also to the abundant evidence of Pooler’s bad temper and\n\npropensity to violence when he was drunk. See Housel, 238 F.3d at 1298 (stating\n\ncounsel “could reasonably have decided to avoid using evidence of [defendant]’s\n\nintoxication on the night of the offense and his history of substance abuse” because\n\n“[e]vidence of drug and alcohol abuse is ‘a two-edged sword,’ and a lawyer may\n\nreasonably decide that it could hurt as much as help the defense” (citation\n\nomitted)); Johnson v. Sec’y, Dep’t of Corr., 643 F.3d 907, 934–35 (11th Cir. 2011)\n\n(noting counsel may fail to investigate line of mitigating evidence because of\n\n“strategic purpose” of “avoiding the possibility of opening the door to what could\n\nbe harmful evidence”); see also Suggs v. McNeil, 609 F.3d 1218, 1231 (11th Cir\n\n2010) (observing that evidence of alcohol abuse “is often a ‘two-edged sword’”\n\n       14\n         Salnick even discussed with Pooler the possibility of plying a voluntary intoxication\ndefense in the guilt phase, but rejected that option because Pooler was adamant that he did not\nwant to use a defense that involved admitting he committed the crimes.\n\n\n                                               48\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 49 of 58\n\nthat may have caused some jurors to vote for death); Grayson v. Thompson, 257\n\nF.3d 1194, 1227 (11th Cir. 2001) (concluding alcohol-abuse evidence could have\n\nbeen harmful); Tompkins v. Moore, 193 F.3d 1327, 1338 (11th Cir. 1999) (same);\n\nWaldrop v. Jones, 77 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir. 1996) (same). In any event, the\n\nalcohol evidence was inconsistent with Salnick’s penalty phase strategy of\n\ngenerating a measure of sympathy for Pooler and showing him to be a good friend\n\nand family man, a military veteran, and a productive, employed member of society.\n\nSee Housel, 238 F.3d at 1296 (finding reasonable counsel’s choice to employ a\n\nhumanizing penalty phase strategy that emphasized the defendant’s “family-\n\nfriendly side” instead of presenting evidence of his intoxication on the night of the\n\nmurder).\n\n      Accordingly, the Florida Supreme Court’s rejection of this allegation of\n\ndeficient performance, as with the others, was reasonable and consistent with\n\nexisting Supreme Court precedent.\n\nE.    Prejudice\n\n      Likewise, Pooler has not met his burden under AEDPA of showing that the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court’s finding that Pooler was not prejudiced was (1) contrary to\n\nprior Supreme Court holdings, (2) based on an unreasonable application of prior\n\nSupreme Court holdings, or (3) based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in state court.\n\n\n                                           49\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 50 of 58\n\n       Much of the 3.850 evidence Pooler claims his trial counsel Salnick should\n\nhave presented in the penalty phase was not mitigating but aggravating, or else\n\nwould have opened the door to the introduction of aggravating evidence that would\n\nhave diluted its impact. See Reed v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 593 F.3d 1217,\n\n1246 (11th Cir. 2010) (“The probability of proposed mitigating evidence opening\n\nthe door to strong aggravating evidence is an important factor to consider in\n\nassessing the reasonable probability of a different sentencing result.”); Wood v.\n\nAllen, 542 F.3d 1281, 1313 (11th Cir. 2008), aff’d, 558 U.S. 290, 130 S. Ct. 841\n\n(2010) (“[W]e have rejected prejudice arguments where mitigation evidence was a\n\n‘two-edged sword’ or would have opened the door to damaging evidence.”); see\n\nalso Suggs, 609 F.3d at 1231–33; Grayson, 257 F.3d at 1227–28; Waldrop, 77 F.3d\n\nat 1313. For example, the school records contain repeated negative comments\n\nabout Pooler’s diligence, conduct, and attendance. 15 The military records show\n\nthat Pooler was frequently disciplined for offenses, mostly absences without leave,\n\nand was found guilty in a court-martial for using disrespectful language to a\n\nsuperior officer and for refusing to obey orders and suffered a reduction in rank.\n\nAnd the 3.850 evidence includes numerous instances of Pooler displaying a bad,\n\n\n       15\n          Pooler’s school records contain notes such as, “Leroy stays out of school too much,”\n“School doesn’t seem to interest Leroy,” he is “very slow . . . [and] plays and talks while in\nclass,” he “is very mischievous, stays out of school playing hooky,” and he “could do much\nbetter.”\n\n\n\n                                               50\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 51 of 58\n\nviolent temper: (1) nephew Brian Warren said that Pooler “became violent and had\n\na hard time controlling his temper”; (2) Brian Warren was “actually physically\n\nafraid of” Pooler in the time period leading up to Brown’s murder, and Darren\n\nWarren also said that Pooler’s behavior was frightening; and (3) Pooler, while\n\ndrunk, told Brian Warren he would kill Brown and several times told Brown that\n\nhe would kill her. Salnick too testified that he had discovered evidence that Pooler\n\nhad a bad temper, a violent background, and was known to argue with people and\n\ncarry a gun.16 Admitting such testimony would have negated Salnick’s successful\n\nattempt at keeping this harmful information from the jury.\n\n       Other 3.850 evidence Pooler claims Salnick should have presented was\n\nmerely cumulative to evidence Salnick already put on. Brian and Darren Warren\n\ntestified that Pooler tried to be a good father to his four daughters, but Pooler’s\n\nother family members testified to that in the penalty phase. Dr. Brannon’s\n\ntestimony (e.g., that Pooler had borderline intelligence, poor reading ability, and\n\nneuropsychological deficits) echoed what was already presented through Dr.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n         For instance, Pooler’s supervisor Carlton Weeks testified that Pooler was ill-tempered\nand aggressive, that people did not want to work with him, that he seemed to be a violent person,\nand that Weeks knew of one instance in which Pooler brandished a gun during an argument.\n\n\n\n                                               51\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 52 of 58\n\nLevine and/or Pooler’s family members. 17 And Pooler’s trial counsel already\n\npresented evidence of Pooler’s military service in Vietnam. “Obviously, a\n\npetitioner cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of the Strickland test with evidence\n\nthat is merely cumulative of evidence already presented at trial.” Rose v. McNeil,\n\n634 F.3d 1224, 1243 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 190 (2011).\n\n       What remains when the damaging and cumulative 3.850 evidence is stripped\n\naway is fairly weak. In short, when we consider all the evidence—what was\n\npresented at trial and in the 3.850 proceeding—we conclude that there is no\n\nreasonable probability that Pooler would have received a life sentence instead of\n\ndeath. More to the point, we conclude that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision\n\nthat Pooler did not satisfy Strickland’s prejudice prong was not contrary to\n\nSupreme Court precedent, did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent,\n\nand was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nstate-court evidence.\n\nF.     Pooler’s Reliance on Porter\n\n       We also reject all of Pooler’s arguments that are based on Porter v.\n\nMcCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 130 S. Ct. 447 (2009). First, we point out that the\n\n\n\n       17\n         In fact, notwithstanding Pooler’s arguments that Salnick’s performance was deficient\nfor not obtaining a mitigation-specific expert evaluation of Pooler, Dr. Brannon conducted such\nan evaluation and found little that was not already noted by the several competency experts.\n\n\n\n                                               52\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 53 of 58\n\nSupreme Court’s 2009 Porter decision was after the Florida Supreme Court’s 2008\n\ndecision in Pooler II, and thus Porter itself does not constitute clearly established\n\nfederal law for § 2254(d) purposes for Pooler’s case. Thus, the issue is not\n\nwhether the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Pooler II was contrary to or an\n\nunreasonable application of Porter, but whether the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nPorter illustrates that the Florida Supreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland\n\nor some other pre-Pooler II holding of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n      Second, and in any event, the factual differences between the two cases—as\n\nto both the performance and prejudice prongs of the ineffective-counsel analysis—\n\nare substantial and numerous. For example, Porter’s counsel at the penalty phase\n\ncalled only one witness (Porter’s ex-wife) and presented almost no mitigating\n\nevidence at all. Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 449. The penalty phase evidence “left the jury\n\nknowing hardly anything about [Porter] other than the facts of his crimes.” Id.\n\n      By contrast, Pooler’s counsel Salnick called four mental health experts\n\n(neuropsychologist Levine, psychologist Alexander, and jail psychiatrists\n\nDesormeau and Armstrong), jail officer Arthur Rock, Pooler’s friend and co-\n\nworker Alice Bradford, and three of Pooler’s family members (his brother, sister,\n\nand father). These witnesses told the jury, among other things, that Pooler: (1) had\n\nan IQ around 80, in the low-average to mildly impaired range, and a third-grade\n\nreading level; (2) suffered depressive symptoms in jail, but behaved well there; (3)\n\n\n                                          53\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 54 of 58\n\nwas a reliable and punctual employee of the same employer for seven years; (4)\n\nhelped Bradford, a single parent, with yard work; (5) was nice, polite, and\n\nrespectful to Bradford and she trusted him around her son; (6) grew up in a close,\n\nsupportive, religious family; (7) was a good father to his four daughters; (8) served\n\nmore than six years in the United States Marine Corps, including service in\n\nVietnam; and (9) had problems, including temper problems, after he returned from\n\nVietnam. The jury heard much that would humanize Pooler, but nevertheless\n\nrecommended that Pooler receive the death penalty.\n\n      Third, Porter materially differs from the instant case because in Porter, the\n\nSupreme Court decided the performance prong de novo, without AEDPA\n\ndeference. See id. at 452. And Porter’s trial counsel’s penalty-phase preparation\n\nwas plainly deficient. As the Supreme Court noted, Porter’s counsel: (1) “had\n\nonly one short meeting with Porter regarding the penalty phase”; (2) did not\n\ninterview Porter’s family members; (3) did not ever request Porter’s school,\n\nmilitary, and medical records; (4) ignored avenues of investigation revealed by the\n\ncourt-ordered competency evaluations, which “reported Porter’s very few years of\n\nregular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his\n\nfather’s ‘over-discipline’”; and (5) told the jury that “Porter was not ‘mentally\n\nhealthy’” but did not present any mental health evidence. Id. at 449, 453 (brackets\n\nomitted). Here, not only do we have a decision of the Florida Supreme Court on\n\n\n                                          54\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 55 of 58\n\ncounsel’s performance to which we must defer under AEDPA, but the evidence\n\nrecounted above demonstrates that trial counsel Salnick investigated mitigating\n\nevidence much more thoroughly and presented much more of what he found.\n\n      Further, as to prejudice, the mitigating evidence adduced in Porter’s 3.850\n\nproceedings was far more powerful than that present here. In Porter, unlike this\n\ncase, there was evidence of extensive childhood physical abuse: Porter’s father\n\nroutinely beat Porter’s mother in Porter’s presence, despite Porter’s attempts to\n\nprotect her, and Porter himself was a “favorite target” of his father’s abuse. Id. at\n\n449. Porter’s father beat Porter and, at least once, shot at him with a gun. Id.\n\nAccording to Porter’s siblings, Porter’s father “was violent every weekend.” Id.\n\nPorter’s case also featured expert testimony that Porter had brain damage, which is\n\nnot present in this case. Id. at 451.\n\n      Additionally, Porter’s 3.850 hearing featured detailed and moving testimony\n\nabout Porter’s military service from Porter’s company commander. Id. at 450.\n\nThis testimony revealed that: (1) Porter enlisted in the Army at age 17 and served\n\nin the Korean War; (2) at the battle of Kunu-ri, Porter’s unit fought in bitter cold,\n\nwith little or no food or sleep through five days of combat, all of which Porter\n\nendured while having a gunshot wound in his leg; (3) Porter’s unit then “engaged\n\nin a ‘fierce hand-to-hand fight’” with the enemy before finally receiving\n\npermission to withdraw; (4) less than three months later, Porter fought at the battle\n\n\n                                          55\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 56 of 58\n\nof Chip’yong-ni, during which Porter’s regiment “was cut off from the rest of the\n\nEighth Army and defended itself for two days and two nights under constant fire”;\n\n(5) Porter’s company was ordered to charge the enemy’s defensive positions on\n\nhigh ground, during which the company came under heavy mortar, artillery, and\n\nmachine gun fire; (6) Porter’s company suffered more than 50% casualties in the\n\nbattle, and Porter himself was wounded again; and (7) for his wartime military\n\nservice, Porter was awarded two Purple Hearts, the Combat Infantryman Badge,\n\nand other decorations, and his unit received the Presidential Unit Citation for its\n\nperformance at Chip’yong-ni. Id. at 449–50.\n\n       In contrast, Pooler’s 3.850 proceedings produced no evidence of childhood\n\nphysical abuse and much less detailed evidence of Pooler’s wartime service in\n\nVietnam. Pooler’s military records did show that he participated in counter-\n\ninsurgency and combat operations and was awarded three basic service medals.\n\nBut no one with first-hand knowledge of Pooler’s wartime service testified on his\n\nbehalf either at trial or in the 3.850 proceedings. 18\n\n       And Pooler’s military records show that he was frequently the subject of\n\nmilitary discipline. While both Porter and Pooler were disciplined for being absent\n\n\n\n       18\n           As to adjustment problems after wartime, the Supreme Court noted that “Porter’s expert\ntestified that [Porter’s] symptoms would easily warrant a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress\ndisorder.” Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 450 n.4. Pooler’s 3.850 expert Dr. Brannon, however, could not\nsay whether Pooler’s symptoms actually rose to the level of PTSD.\n\n\n                                               56\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 57 of 58\n\nwithout leave (“AWOL”), Pooler’s infractions were more numerous and serious.\n\nPorter went AWOL twice while in Korea—for which he was not punished at all\n\nbecause unauthorized absences in the field were not uncommon occurrences in\n\nwartime and sometimes were unintentional—and once back in the United States in\n\norder to see his son. Id. at 450 & n.3. Pooler, on the other hand, was found\n\nAWOL six times in one year, and was also punished for using disrespectful\n\nlanguage to a superior officer and for refusing to obey orders. As the Florida\n\nSupreme Court noted in Pooler II, “Pooler’s military records revealed that he was\n\ncharged with at least nineteen different offenses on fifteen different occasions\n\nbetween October 1969 and February 1971 and that he was court-martialed for\n\nseveral of these offenses.” Pooler II, 980 So. 2d at 467.\n\n      Therefore, Porter presented a far more mitigating evidentiary profile than\n\nthis case does. In Porter, the penalty-phase jury heard almost nothing of Porter\n\nexcept his crimes, but could have—and should have—been presented with\n\npersuasive evidence of Porter’s extensive childhood abuse, his potential brain\n\ndamage, and his heroic military service under horrific conditions, which left him\n\nphysically and mentally wounded. In Pooler, though, the jury already heard about\n\nPooler’s close family life; his low intelligence; his being a good father, friend, and\n\nemployee; and his voluntary service in the Vietnam War and its negative effect on\n\nhim. And Pooler’s counsel successfully kept the jury from hearing significant\n\n\n                                          57\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012        Page: 58 of 58\n\nnegative evidence that was later adduced in the 3.850 proceedings and that is not\n\npresent in Porter: for example, that Pooler was aggressive and short-tempered, that\n\nmost of his co-workers did not want to work with him, that Pooler was known to\n\ncarry a gun and brandish it during arguments, that Pooler spent time with a\n\nprostitute hours before murdering his ex-girlfriend Brown, that Pooler was\n\nfrequently disciplined in the Army, that Pooler was an indifferent student, and that\n\nPooler’s own family members were afraid of him when he drank, which was\n\nfrequently.\n\n       Simply put, Porter does not show that the Florida Supreme Court in Pooler II\n\nunreasonably applied Strickland or any other pre-existing United States Supreme\n\nCourt holding. 19\n\n                                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court’s denial of\n\nPooler’s § 2254 petition.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n       19\n          Pooler also relies on Sears v. Upton, — U.S. —, 130 S. Ct. 3259 (2010), but that case is\nmaterially different, too. Sears’s counsel performed only a cursory mitigation investigation and\npresented evidence only about the defendant’s middle-class upbringing and the potential effect of\na death sentence on his family. Id. at 3261–62. Counsel failed to discover, or present, any\nevidence about the defendant being abused as a child or his substantial cognitive impairments.\nId. at 3262–64. And most importantly, the Sears Court did not conclude that the defendant had\nsatisfied the Strickland prejudice prong. Id. at 3267. It merely found that the state court\nmisapplied Strickland and remanded for further proceedings. See id. (“It is for the state court . . .\nto undertake this [Strickland prejudice prong] reweighing in the first instance.”).\n\n\n                                                 58\n\f",

The Florida state courts denied Pooler’s ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims. After review and oral argument, we conclude, as did\n\nthe district court, that the state courts’ denial of Pooler’s claims was not\n\nunreasonable. We affirm.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Facts of the Crime\n\n      On January 30, 1995, Pooler murdered his ex-girlfriend, Kim Brown, after\n\nlearning that she had begun seeing another man. Before the murder, Pooler\n\nthreatened to kill Brown. Two days later, Pooler went to Brown’s apartment and\n\nshot her five times while she begged Pooler not to kill her. Pooler also shot\n\nBrown’s younger brother. The Florida Supreme Court summarized the evidence\n\npresented at the guilt phase of Pooler’s trial:\n\n      On January 28, 1995, Carolyn Glass, a long-time acquaintance of Kim\n      Brown, told her that Pooler had said he was going to kill her because\n      if he could not have her, no one else would. . . . Two days later, Pooler\n      knocked on the front door of the apartment where Kim and her\n                                           2\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 3 of 58\n\n      younger brother, Alvonza Colson, lived with their mother. Seeing\n      Pooler through the door window, Kim told him that she did not want\n      to see him anymore. Alvonza opened the door halfway and asked\n      Pooler what he wanted but would not let him in. When Pooler\n      brandished a gun, Alvonza let go of the door and tried to run out the\n      door, but he was shot in the back by Pooler. Pooler pulled Alvonza\n      back into the apartment by his leg. Kim begged Pooler not to kill her\n      brother or her and began vomiting into her hands. She suggested they\n      take Alvonza to the hospital. Pooler originally agreed but then told\n      Alvonza to stay and call himself an ambulance while Pooler left with\n      Kim. However, rather than follow Pooler out the door, Kim shut and\n      locked it behind him. Alvonza told Kim to run out the back door for\n      her life while he stayed in the apartment to call for an ambulance.\n      When he discovered that the telephone wires had been cut, he started\n      for the back door, just as Pooler was breaking in through the front\n      entrance.\n             Pooler first found Alvonza, who was hiding in an area near the\n      back door, but when he heard Kim yelling for help, he left Alvonza\n      and continued after Kim. When he eventually caught up with her, he\n      struck her in the head with his gun, causing it to discharge. In front of\n      numerous witnesses, he pulled her toward his car as she screamed and\n      begged him not to kill her. When she fought against going in the car,\n      Pooler pulled her back toward the apartment building and shot her\n      several times, pausing once to say, “You want some more?” Kim had\n      been shot a total of five times, including once in the head. Pooler then\n      got into his car and drove away.\n\nPooler v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1760797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1760797/pooler-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377 (Fla. 1997) (“Pooler I”).\n\n      Police arrested Pooler at his home. The State indicted him on charges of\n\nfirst-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and armed burglary. The state\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 4 of 58\n\ntrial court appointed veteran criminal defense attorney Michael Salnick to\n\nrepresent Pooler. 1\n\nB.     Trial Counsel’s Investigation of Mitigating Evidence\n\n       In May 1995, trial counsel Salnick moved the court for funds to hire an\n\ninvestigator to help prepare for trial, and also specifically to travel to Louisiana—\n\nwhere Pooler grew up and where his family still lived—to interview witnesses “for\n\nPhase 2 [i.e., penalty phase] discovery.” The state trial court granted the motion,\n\nand Salnick retained an experienced private investigator, Marvin Jenne.\n\n       Salnick and Jenne had worked together “in almost every significant case”\n\nSalnick had in private practice. 2 Salnick instructed Jenne to “find anything and\n\neverything” he could about Pooler, whether good or bad. Salnick, as he later\n\ntestified in postconviction proceedings, wanted to consider anything that would\n\nsave his client’s life.\n\n       Investigator Jenne’s invoice includes entries showing these penalty-phase-\n\nrelated efforts: (1) attending a 2.2 hour meeting with Pooler to discuss “potential\n\nfamily members in Louisiana to be interviewed in Phase II investigation”; (2)\n\n\n\n       1\n        At the time of his appointment to represent Pooler, Salnick had been practicing law for\nabout sixteen years. Salnick had experience handling murder cases and penalty-phase\nproceedings.\n       2\n       At the time of Pooler’s case, Jenne had been an investigator for fifteen years and had\nworked on five to ten capital cases.\n\n\n                                                4\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 5 of 58\n\nsending letters to Pooler’s family members in Louisiana; (3) making telephone\n\ncalls to family members Delores Pooler, Darren Warren, and Carolyn Upps; (4)\n\ntraveling to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for three days to interview Pooler’s family\n\nmembers regarding mitigation; (5) sending multiple letters to schools Pooler\n\nattended; and (6) attending a 1.9 hour meeting with Pooler to discuss the\n\ninterviews with Pooler’s family members. 3\n\n       Pooler told Salnick and Jenne that he graduated high school, had four\n\ndaughters in Louisiana, and worked for seven years at a moving company. Pooler\n\nalso reported that he served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam\n\nWar, re-enlisted after his original period of enlistment, and received an honorable\n\ndischarge.\n\n       Investigator Jenne tried to corroborate all the background information he\n\nreceived from Pooler by talking with other persons. Jenne made telephone calls\n\nand sent letters requesting Pooler’s school records, but he “was basically told [the\n\nrecords] were not available.” Jenne asked Pooler’s relatives, including his father,\n\nwhether Pooler graduated from high school. The relatives said Pooler graduated.\n\n       The defense made an effort to obtain Pooler’s military records, but the\n\nattempt was unsuccessful. Pooler’s brother confirmed that Pooler served in the\n\n       3\n        Jenne’s records contain the name and telephone number of Pooler’s nephew Brian\nWarren, who lived in Orlando, Florida. Jenne did not recall whether he ever spoke with Brian\nWarren.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 6 of 58\n\nMarines and was honorably discharged. Jenne asked other relatives about Pooler’s\n\nmilitary service, and all of them said he served honorably in Vietnam.\n\n      Jenne obtained some employment records relating to Pooler’s work history\n\nin Palm Beach County, Florida. Jenne interviewed two of Pooler’s co-workers at\n\nthe moving company in West Palm Beach, Alice Bradford and Carlton Weeks.\n\nSalnick decided Alice Bradford would be the better witness because Weeks, who\n\nwas Pooler’s supervisor, made some comments that Salnick “thought could have\n\nbeen troublesome and if he was deposed and it was further explored there might\n\nhave been some more negative information that came out.”\n\n      Weeks stated that Pooler was a “good worker as long as things went totally\n\nhis way,” but Pooler was “aggressive” and had “a chip on his shoulder.” Pooler\n\nwas short-tempered, wanted to take charge on every task he was assigned, and\n\nmost of his co-workers “did not care to work with him.” Because of Pooler’s\n\naggressiveness, there was “[a]lways a problem” between him and his co-workers.\n\nPooler “was just narrow minded and hard headed and very aggressive.” Pooler got\n\ninto arguments with co-workers that Weeks had to resolve. Weeks found it\n\ndifficult to find people to work with Pooler “because of his temperament.”\n\n      Furthermore, Weeks believed that Pooler “appear[ed] to be a violent\n\nperson.” Pooler owned a gun and sometimes brought it to work. One time, Pooler\n\ngot into an argument with a co-worker and returned with his gun and was “waving\n\n\n                                         6\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 7 of 58\n\nit around threatening people.” In fact, Salnick reported that “[o]ne of the things\n\nthat ran through a lot of stuff that we looked at, was that Mr. Pooler had a violent\n\nbackground, he had been known to carry a gun, chased people, he’d been known to\n\nargue, to hit somebody.”\n\n       The defense team investigated whether Pooler had a drinking problem,\n\nwhich entailed obtaining police reports and interviewing relatives and current and\n\nformer employers. Salnick discovered before trial that Pooler had gone to the\n\npolice department a few hours before Brown’s murder to report a crime. The\n\npolice report stated that Pooler had been sitting in his car early that morning with a\n\nfriend of Pooler’s girlfriend. Pooler “fell asleep due to intoxication,” and when he\n\nawoke about two hours later, “his wallet was in his front pocket and $301.00 were\n\nmissing.” Pooler reported the theft occurred about 3:00 am, and he arrived at the\n\npolice station at 6:43 am.\n\n       Pooler told Salnick that the woman who robbed him was a prostitute.\n\nSalnick did not want the jury to be aware of Pooler’s time spent with a prostitute a\n\nfew hours before he murdered his ex-girlfriend, stating later that “[t]here is no way\n\nI would have done that. I just didn’t think it was appropriate.” 4\n\nC.     Pretrial Competency Hearing\n\n       4\n        Moreover, Salnick chose not to pursue a voluntary intoxication defense in the guilt phase\nbecause Pooler told Salnick he did “not want a defense that is going to admit that he committed\nthe crime.”\n\n\n                                               7\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 8 of 58\n\n      In November 1995, the state trial court held a hearing to determine whether\n\nPooler was competent to stand trial. The state trial court appointed clinical\n\nneuropsychologist Dr. Laurence S. Levine and psychiatrist Dr. Norman\n\nSilversmith to examine Pooler and testify at the competency hearing.\n\n      Dr. Levine examined Pooler for six hours. Dr. Levine interviewed Pooler,\n\nadministered a number of neuropsychological tests, and reviewed Pooler’s jail\n\nmedical records and arrest record. Among the tests Dr. Levine administered was\n\nthe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (“WAIS-R”). Pooler’s overall\n\nscore was 80, which was at the bottom of the low-average range. Dr. Levine found\n\nno evidence of malingering.\n\n      Dr. Levine found Pooler overall to be competent. Dr. Levine also found that\n\nPooler “would be expected to have some difficulties,” though not insurmountable\n\nones, in helping his counsel to plan his defense and to challenge the State’s\n\nwitnesses. Pooler’s attention functioning “was not terribly impaired but it was not\n\noptimum.” Additionally, Pooler’s vocabulary and reading ability were “far lower\n\nthan the average range.” Thus, Pooler would “require somewhat more support and\n\nmore explanation.” Nevertheless, Dr. Levine opined that Pooler “was a fine\n\nsubject,” “listened carefully to [Levine’s] explanation of the evaluation,” and\n\n“responded very appropriately and intelligently with regard to protecting [his]\n\nconfidential [legal documents].”\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012     Page: 9 of 58\n\n      Dr. Levine believed it possible that Pooler had hypothyroidism and\n\npsychomotor retardation, which could affect his ability to assist counsel. Dr.\n\nLevine recommended that his attorney take time to help explain complex legal\n\nissues to Pooler and use simple language in doing so.\n\n      Pooler reported no prior psychiatric treatment to Dr. Levine. All Dr. Levine\n\ncould find in the records he reviewed was treatment for depression following\n\nPooler’s arrest for Brown’s murder.\n\n      Psychiatrist Dr. Norman Silversmith, the second expert to testify at the\n\ncompetency hearing, examined Pooler for about an hour. Dr. Silversmith\n\ninterviewed Pooler but “did not run any standard clinical psychological tests.” Dr.\n\nSilversmith’s questioning of Pooler included “background information, marital\n\nstatus, school history, work histories, and . . . medical history.”\n\n      Pooler appeared to have no difficulty understanding Dr. Silversmith, had an\n\nintact memory, and was not delusional or confused. Pooler’s psychological\n\nfunctioning was within normal limits.\n\n      Dr. Silversmith opined that Pooler was competent to stand trial. Although\n\nthe purpose of Dr. Silversmith’s evaluation of Pooler was competency and not “to\n\nmake a diagnostic impression determination,” he nevertheless felt “there was no\n\nquestion that there was a personality or character disorder” present, though he “did\n\nnot specify whether it would be antisocial or passive dependent.” Dr. Silversmith\n\n\n                                           9\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 10 of 58\n\n“also indicated that [Pooler had] a mental disorder non-psychotic, unspecified.”\n\nDr. Silversmith allowed, though, that “incarceration in and of itself contributes to\n\nmental or emotional issues, so it’s an unspecified mental disorder.” Dr.\n\nSilversmith did not make a definitive diagnosis, but he believed Pooler was\n\ncertainly suffering anxiety and “a certain degree of depression,” which “could\n\ncertainly have suggested an adjustment disorder, adjacent with incarceration.” Dr.\n\nSilversmith’s report noted that Pooler did not “appear to be suffering from any\n\novert mental illness or mental retardation.”\n\n      At the conclusion of the competency hearing, the state trial court found that\n\nPooler was competent to stand trial.\n\nD.    Guilt Phase\n\n      The guilt phase of Pooler’s trial lasted from January 9 to 17, 1996. The\n\nState called victim Alvonza Colson, who described Pooler’s shooting him,\n\nmurdering his sister, and the burglary. Colson identified Pooler as the perpetrator.\n\nThe State also called witnesses who testified, among other things, that: (1) a week\n\nbefore the murder, Pooler told one of Brown’s neighbors that he would kill Brown\n\nbecause he loved her and, if he could not have her, no one else would; (2)\n\nbystanders, who knew Pooler, saw him shoot Brown while she begged for her life\n\nand heard Pooler yell at Brown while he was doing so, “Bitch, didn’t I tell you I\n\n[would] kill you?”; (3) Pooler shot Brown and she fell, at which point he turned\n\n\n                                          10\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 11 of 58\n\nher over, asked if she “want[ed] some more,” and shot her in the head; (4) after\n\nPooler shot Brown, he kicked her body before getting in his car and driving away;\n\nand (5) none of Brown’s five gunshot wounds were immediately fatal.\n\n        The jury convicted Pooler of the first-degree murder of Brown, the\n\nattempted first-degree murder of Colson, and the burglary of Brown and Colson’s\n\nhome.\n\nE.      Penalty Phase: Defense’s Mental Health Testimony in Mitigation\n\n        The penalty phase ran from February 2 to 8, 1996. The State put forth no\n\nevidence, resting upon the guilt-phase evidence. The defense called, as mitigation\n\nwitnesses, mental health experts and lay witnesses. The defense wanted to show\n\nthat Pooler had low intelligence and mental health disturbances and problems, but\n\nyet had worked hard and served in the military, including in Vietnam, and should\n\nhave his life spared.\n\n        Neuropsychologist Dr. Levine first testified that he was appointed by the\n\nstate trial court to evaluate Pooler’s competency. Dr. Levine described the\n\nevaluation, which included assessments of Pooler’s intelligence and cognitive\n\nfunctioning. Pooler’s cognitive functioning was “in the low average to mildly\n\nimpaired range.” Pooler’s performance IQ results ranged from about 75 to 85.\n\nLow average is 80 to 89, and borderline retarded is 70 to 79.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f               Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 12 of 58\n\n      On the WAIS-R intelligence test, Pooler’s scores were 81 for verbal IQ, a 79\n\nfor performance IQ, and a full-scale IQ of 80. Pooler’s scores put him “right on\n\nthe cusp of the low average to the borderline range.” Pooler scored in the\n\nborderline range on four of nine WAIS-R subtests. Pooler’s reading ability, which\n\nwas at the third-grade level, “was dramatically impaired.”\n\n      Pooler shared with Dr. Levine portions of his educational, military, and job\n\nhistory. Pooler told him that Pooler graduated from high school, served in the\n\nmilitary and achieved the rank of sergeant, and held down a job for an extended\n\nperiod of time. To Dr. Levine, this suggested Pooler’s intelligence should be in the\n\naverage range, not low average to borderline, but Dr. Levine found that all of\n\nPooler’s test results were internally consistent, and there was no evidence of\n\nmalingering.\n\n      Dr. Levine also talked about Pooler’s mental health. Dr. Levine learned\n\nfrom the jail’s medical records that Pooler, after his arrest, “had a significant\n\nemotional reaction to whatever it was that was going on.” Pooler “had pretty much\n\nresolved his mental health issues” by the time Dr. Levine examined him. Dr.\n\nLevine noted, though, that Pooler appeared to be “experiencing some depressive\n\nsymptoms.” Dr. Levine’s “clinical impression” was that Pooler had some\n\nsymptoms of depression but “did not meet the criteria for a [depression]\n\ndiagnosis.”\n\n\n                                           12\n\f              Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 13 of 58\n\n       In mitigation, the defense next called psychologist Steve Alexander. Dr.\n\nAlexander, also appointed by the court, had evaluated Pooler’s competency, too. 5\n\nDr. Alexander concluded that Pooler was not competent to stand trial.\n\n       Dr. Alexander admitted that Pooler’s ability to appreciate the criminality of\n\nhis conduct, or to conform his conduct to the law’s requirements, was not\n\nimpaired. Dr. Alexander saw no signs of “any long-term mental illness, or\n\npersonality disorder or disturbance that would have been existing at the time of the\n\nshooting.”\n\n       However, Dr. Alexander believed Pooler was not competent because he did\n\nnot fully understand the current legal proceedings. Other inmates were telling\n\nPooler incorrect information and Pooler “was grossly misinformed for what\n\nappropriate court procedure was and what role he would take in trial.” Thus,\n\nPooler “would totally misunderstand the proceedings as they were unfolding, and\n\ndue to misunderstandings and misperceptions maybe even be disruptive.”\n\n       Although Dr. Alexander found it “clear in talking to [Pooler that] he’s a man\n\nof relatively limited intelligence,” he did not need to administer an IQ test because\n\nPooler was “not so mentally deficient or retarded that that was the basis of an\n\n\n\n       5\n         The record does not reveal when Dr. Alexander was appointed or why he did not testify\nat the pretrial competency hearing. Salnick did not call Dr. Silversmith, who testified at the\ncompetency hearing that Pooler was competent.\n\n\n                                              13\n\f                Case: 12-12059   Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 14 of 58\n\nincompetency.” Dr. Alexander estimated Pooler’s IQ was between 75 and 85,\n\nwhich was “in the lower low average range . . . or the upper end of a borderline.”\n\n      According to Dr. Alexander, Pooler was gullible and displayed “some gross\n\nmisperceptions about the legal system and the way it worked.” Pooler’s\n\nincompetence to stand trial was not caused by a mental illness, defect, or disease,\n\n“but instead was just a real lack of understanding [and] basically distrust, given his\n\nsituation, . . . being fearful, not knowing who to believe, and then erroneously,\n\ngiven his . . . limitations, erroneously placing value and importance on the opinions\n\nof other inmates rather than on his attorney.”\n\n      In mitigation, the defense also called psychiatrist Jude Desormeau, who\n\ntestified about Pooler’s depression, his being on suicide watch in the jail, and being\n\nin the jail’s mental health unit receiving treatment. Dr. Desormeau examined\n\nPooler in February 1995 after he was referred by the psychiatric nurse at the jail.\n\nPooler was depressed and anxious and had spoken of harming himself, so he was\n\nplaced on suicide watch.\n\n      Dr. Desormeau concluded Pooler was suffering from “an adjustment\n\ndisorder with mixed features,” making Pooler “very depressed and very anxious\n\nand tearful.” Dr. Desormeau prescribed a tranquilizer. After seven to ten days,\n\nPooler stabilized and was sent to a different doctor. Pooler was then taken off the\n\ntranquilizer.\n\n\n                                          14\n\f               Case: 12-12059   Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 15 of 58\n\n      Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Armstrong, a staff psychiatrist at the jail, also\n\ntestified about Pooler’s depression and adjustment disorder. Dr. Armstrong saw\n\nPooler before he was discharged from the jail’s mental health unit into the general\n\npopulation. Pooler was in Dr. Armstrong’s mental health transitional unit for\n\nabout two weeks. At first, Pooler reported both that he was depressed and that he\n\nheard a voice calling his name, which began when he came to the jail. By the end\n\nof his stay, Pooler “was functioning very well and was ready for the general\n\npopulation.”\n\nF.    Penalty Phase: Defense’s Lay Witnesses\n\n      In mitigation, the defense also called Arthur Rock, a deputy sheriff at the\n\njail, who testified Pooler was “a well-behaved inmate.” Rock reviewed Pooler’s\n\nyear-long jail file and reported that Pooler had received only one disciplinary\n\nwrite-up that year, with no indication of violence in the incident.\n\n      As for Pooler’s long-term employment, co-worker Alice Bradford testified\n\nthat she worked with Pooler at the moving company for the seven years Pooler was\n\nemployed there. Pooler was reliable and punctual.\n\n      Bradford came to know Pooler outside of work because Pooler would help\n\nBradford, who was a single parent, with yard work. Bradford trusted Pooler in her\n\nhome, and he never did anything inappropriate there. Bradford trusted Pooler\n\naround her son. Pooler was very nice, polite, and respectful whenever Bradford\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 16 of 58\n\nsaw him. Bradford believed Pooler to have fairly good intelligence, but the work\n\nhe performed for her was uncomplicated, menial labor.\n\n      In mitigation, the defense also called Pooler’s family members to testify,\n\nspecifically his brother, sister, and father. Pooler’s brother Henry testified that\n\nwhen he and Pooler grew up, their family was close. The Poolers were a religious\n\nfamily. The family was very supportive of Henry and Pooler. Henry was still\n\nclose to Pooler and spoke to him on the phone often. Henry said that he could not\n\nask for a better brother, because Pooler was so “free-hearted.”\n\n      Pooler had four daughters. When they were growing up, Pooler provided for\n\nthem, took care of them, made sure they went to school, and took them to church.\n\n      Henry and Pooler went to school in the 1960s, in segregated schools. Pooler\n\nwas a pretty good student in high school, as he had to maintain a C average to play\n\non the basketball team.\n\n      According to brother Henry, Pooler served more than six years in the United\n\nStates Marine Corps, including service in Vietnam. Pooler initially served six\n\nmonths in the active reserve, then re-enlisted for six years. After Pooler returned\n\nfrom Vietnam, he “looked like he was off a little bit.” Pooler had a bad temper\n\nwhen he returned.\n\n      Pooler’s sister Carolyn testified that she and Pooler got along well when\n\nthey were growing up, though it had been awhile since she had seen him. Pooler\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 17 of 58\n\n“was more like a father figure” to Carolyn, watching over her and taking care of\n\nher.\n\n       Pooler’s family were members of the Baptist Church, and they didn’t have\n\ntrouble getting along with one another “like most families will.” They were “there\n\nfor one another, help[ed] one another, whatever the situation may be.”\n\n       According to sister Carolyn, Pooler was a “very good father” and a “good\n\nprovider” for his daughters. Pooler was baptized, prayed a lot, and was “a good\n\nperson.” Carolyn exhorted the jury to “talk to God before you come up with a\n\ndecision to pass onto Leroy,” because she felt Pooler was worthy of “another\n\nchance” at God’s forgiveness.\n\n       Pooler’s father Henry Pooler, Sr., also testified. Pooler’s father “raised\n\n[Pooler] as far as [he] could,” and Pooler had never given his father any trouble.\n\nPooler’s father told the jury that he loved Pooler and did the best he could for\n\nPooler and his other children.\n\nG.     Penalty Phase Closing Argument\n\n       In his closing argument, defense counsel Salnick argued, among other\n\nthings, that he put on the mental health experts to show Pooler had borderline\n\nintelligence and some mental health problems. To show reliability of the mental\n\nhealth testimony, Salnick emphasized that Dr. Levine and Dr. Alexander both were\n\ncourt-appointed. Salnick discussed the doctors’ findings and argued that the jury\n\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 18 of 58\n\ncould “take into account a mental disturbance, infirmity, problem, intellectual\n\nabilities.” Salnick argued that when the mental health evidence is combined, it\n\nsuggests a life imprisonment sentence is appropriate:\n\n      Now, if you start adding those things up and you start with what\n      happened with the suicide watch and the depression, and then you\n      have a doctor that didn’t find him incompetent but found him\n      borderline in terms of his intelligence, and you have a doctor who\n      found him incompetent, that tells you that there’s some problem here.\n      And I would suggest that from that evidence this problem translates\n      that Leroy Pooler needs the rest of his life in prison, but not to take his\n      life, not here, not here, not in this circumstance.\n\n      Salnick pointed out that Pooler was “a 47 year old man with a first grade\n\nword level, a third grade reading level.” Pooler grew up in segregated schools and\n\ndid not “get the full benefit of a high school education.” Pooler’s family members\n\nconfirmed that, after he returned from Vietnam, “he wasn’t the same, he got angry,\n\nhe was different.” That change was significant “because that chain of events\n\nultimately, unfortunately and sadly, gets us right here.”\n\n      Salnick then recounted the testimony about Pooler’s good qualities and\n\nargued that, although Brown’s murder was “totally inappropriate, totally wrong,\n\ntotally offensive,” it nevertheless represented “one morning out of 47 years.”\n\nSalnick said that Pooler was “a simple man,” “not an intellect,” but “a simple man\n\nfrom a hard working background, who for some reason did something way out of\n\nhis character when this event occurred. This is not the type of a man to be put to\n\ndeath.”\n                                          18\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 19 of 58\n\nH.     Jury Recommendation, Sentencing, and Direct Appeal\n\n       The jury recommended death by a nine-to-three vote. The state trial court\n\nsentenced Pooler to death.\n\n       The court found three statutory aggravating factors: (1) a prior violent felony\n\nconviction (the attempted first-degree murder of Colson); (2) the murder occurred\n\nduring the commission of a burglary; and (3) the murder was especially heinous,\n\natrocious, or cruel.\n\n       The state trial court found the statutory mitigating factor that Pooler\n\nmurdered Brown while under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional\n\ndisturbance, but gave that factor little weight. 6\n\n       The state trial court also found the following non-statutory mitigating\n\nfactors: (1) Pooler served honorably in the military; (2) Pooler had a good\n\nemployment record; (3) Pooler was a good parent; (4) Pooler had done specific\n\ngood deeds and had certain good characteristics; and (5) if not given the death\n\npenalty, Pooler could receive only life without parole or consecutive life sentences.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         The state trial court expressly found that the defense had not established certain other\nstatutory mitigating circumstances: (1) Pooler’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his\nconduct or conform to the requirements of the law was not substantially impaired; (2) Pooler did\nnot act under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person; and (3)\nPooler’s age at the time of the murder (47 years old) was not mitigating.\n\n\n                                               19\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012        Page: 20 of 58\n\nThe state trial court gave Pooler’s honorable military service considerable weight\n\nand attached either some or little weight to the other non-statutory mitigators.7\n\n       The state trial court concluded that not only did the statutory aggravating\n\nfactors far outweigh the mitigators, but also that each of the three aggravating\n\nfactors standing alone would have outweighed all the mitigating factors.\n\n       On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed Pooler’s convictions\n\nand death sentence.

Rule 3.850 Motion and Supporting Materials\n\n       On September 17, 1999, Pooler filed in the Florida trial court (the “3.850\n\ncourt”) a Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion to vacate his\n\nconvictions and death sentence. Pooler’s 3.850 motion claimed, inter alia, that his\n\ntrial counsel Salnick provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately\n\ninvestigate and present mitigation evidence in the penalty phase.\n\n       Attached to the motion were (1) Pooler’s school and military records, and\n\n(2) declarations from Pooler’s nephews Brian and Darren Warren. Pooler’s school\n\n\n       7\n         The state trial court expressly rejected as non-statutory mitigating factors the following:\n(1) Pooler had a good jail record and could adapt well to prison life; (2) Pooler could be\nrehabilitated; (3) Pooler had low normal intelligence; (4) Pooler had mental health problems; and\n(5) the murder resulted from a heated domestic dispute and Pooler was unlikely to endanger\nothers in the future.\n\n\n                                                20\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 21 of 58\n\nrecords end at 11th grade.8 The school records indicate that Pooler scored 75 on an\n\nIQ test in second grade.\n\n       Pooler’s military records show that he: (1) served as a guard and a rifleman\n\nin the Vietnam War; (2) was disciplined frequently, including for six instances\n\nduring a one-year period of being absent without leave; (3) was punished for using\n\ndisrespectful language to a superior officer and for refusing to obey orders; and (4)\n\nwas found guilty in a special court-martial for unauthorized absences and\n\nsentenced to a reduction in pay grade and two months’ confinement with hard\n\nlabor.9 Pooler received three basic service medals: the National Defense Service\n\nMedal, the Vietnamese Service Medal, and the Vietnamese Campaign Medal.\n\n       In their declarations, Pooler’s nephews Brian and Darren Warren discussed\n\nPooler’s emotional problems after returning from Vietnam, his frequent alcohol\n\nabuse, and that he was a good father to his four daughters. Pooler seemed to have\n\nflashbacks to his war experiences; became paranoid, moody, and short-tempered;\n\nand complained that the army “took [his] mind.” Pooler “began to use alcohol to\n\nthe extreme,” and by early 1995, Pooler’s “recreation consisted of hanging out in\n\n\n\n       8\n        The military records indicate that Pooler completed two years of high school and left\nwithout graduating.\n       9\n        Pooler also received a bad conduct discharge, which the U.S. Navy Court of Military\nReview reversed on appeal. Pooler ultimately was released from active duty “under honorable\nconditions.”\n\n\n                                               21\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 22 of 58\n\nthe parking lot near [victim Brown’s] apartment and drinking large amounts of . . .\n\nbeer and hard liquor.” But Pooler loved his daughters, tried to be a good father to\n\nthem, and was involved in their lives.\n\nJ.     3.850 Evidentiary Hearing\n\n       At the 3.850 evidentiary hearing, Pooler called four witnesses: trial counsel\n\nSalnick, his investigator Jenne, Detective Francisco Alonso, and psychologist\n\nMichael Brannon. 10\n\n       Salnick testified about his pretrial mitigation investigation. Salnick “had no\n\nproblem communicating with Mr. Pooler,” whom he characterized as “articulate.”\n\nSalnick stated that “Pooler may not have been a [Rhodes] scholar but he was\n\nextremely street smart, savvy, and understood exactly what was going on.” Pooler\n\nhad “specific recollection of things just prior to the homicide.”\n\n       Salnick initially had some concerns about whether Pooler was competent,\n\nand said, “in a case involving the death penalty you want to look at everything to\n\nmake sure your client is okay mentally.” Nevertheless, Salnick explained:\n\n\n       10\n         The 3.850 court conducted proceedings on Pooler’s competency. Pooler’s 3.850\ncounsel stated that he (1) “had difficulties in obtaining information from Mr. Pooler, such as\nemployment history, military history, and educational background,” and (2) the information on\nsuch subjects that counsel obtained from other sources was “inconsistent at best [with] material\ngathered from Pooler himself.”\n       The 3.850 court appointed mental health experts Dr. John Spencer and Dr. Michael\nBrannon to examine Pooler’s competency. Both Dr. Spencer and Dr. Brannon found Pooler\ncompetent, and after a competency hearing, the 3.850 court found Pooler was competent. Dr.\nSpencer died shortly before the evidentiary hearing.\n\n\n                                               22\n\f              Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 23 of 58\n\n        I was convinced that Mr. Pooler knew what was going on, and that\n        Mr. Pooler was capable of relaying facts to me, Mr. Pooler[] was\n        capable of sharing with me information. He had no trouble giving us\n        witnesses[’] names, even on the eve of trial he came up with\n        something, and you go through that information and you, as an\n        attorney, you have to sort out what you are going to use and what you\n        are not going to use.\n\n        Salnick noted that mental health issues are common in penalty phase trials.\n\nA penalty phase investigation generally includes a mental health evaluation,\n\nalthough it depends on the case. Salnick explained that “every attorney\n\n[investigates a client’s psychological background in] different ways,” and that\n\n“[s]ometimes you use competency experts, if you need[] them[,] for Phase II;\n\nsometimes you hire new experts.”\n\n        Salnick testified that there were “a bunch” of strategic reasons for not hiring\n\nhis own mental health experts to testify at Pooler’s penalty phase, and instead\n\nchoosing to call the court-appointed competency experts and the jail personnel.\n\nFor example, the court-appointed experts had credibility because they supported\n\nthe defense’s position in the penalty phase and were not being paid by the defense\n\nteam.\n\n        Salnick did not hire new doctors to do a penalty phase psychological workup\n\non Pooler because of what he already had gathered. Salnick said, “We had the\n\ncompetency doctors, we had Dr. Desormeau, we had Dr. Armstrong, we had\n\nfamily members, we had a jail employee, we had a co-worker from his\n\n\n                                           23\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 24 of 58\n\nemployment and we made a strategic decision as to how we were going to proceed\n\nwith Phase II.”\n\n      Salnick testified that he and Jenne tried to get Pooler’s military records, but\n\nwere unsuccessful. And in any event, had they obtained and presented the military\n\nrecords, it “would have backfired” because Salnick had seen a portion of Pooler’s\n\nmilitary records in the 3.850 case and “it talks about AWOL, and hitting people,\n\nand talks about [Pooler having] not such a stel[l]ar career in the military.” Those\n\nthings were inconsistent with what the defense was trying to show in the penalty\n\nphase, which was that Pooler served his country honorably in Vietnam.\n\n      Salnick had argued to the jury that Pooler had a good military record\n\n“[b]ased exactly on what [Pooler] told [Salnick].” Salnick explained:\n\n      If my client tells me that information and my investigator, who I\n      believe went to Louisiana for a period of time, and that’s corroborated\n      by a relative, it seems to me that is consistent with our strategy to\n      show that this incident was the product of a man who for 15 years had\n      not been arrested, lived a good life and served our country. That was\n      certainly what we decided, and based on it at the time it was certainly\n      reasonable.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n      Salnick learned later that what Pooler told Salnick before trial, and what his\n\nrelatives confirmed—Pooler graduated from high school—was not true. But\n\nSalnick testified that because his client told him something and his client’s\n\nrelatives backed it up, it was “extremely reasonable” to present it to the jury.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 25 of 58\n\nSalnick “had no reason to disbelieve” his client. Salnick reiterated that although\n\nJenne tried to get the military records, “with Mr. Pooler telling us that he had been\n\nin the service and was honorably discharged, with his brother corroborating that,\n\nwe didn’t need any more at that point.”\n\n      Salnick was aware of the notion that in a penalty phase trial it can be helpful\n\nto present evidence of bad circumstances from the defendant’s life so that “perhaps\n\nthe jury may opt to be forgiving and spare his or her life.” Salnick believed that in\n\n“some cases that’s a very good strategy depending upon the information that you\n\nhave.” And in some cases, there are no significant positive aspects of the\n\ndefendant’s life to present. But in Pooler’s case, Salnick had positive evidence,\n\nand decided “as a matter of strategy” to present a positive story of Pooler’s life:\n\n      We had an individual . . . [who] served his country in Vietnam, re-\n      upped, raised his daughter[s], always took care of them . . . . His\n      brother Henry said how he was a good parent, worked, he had a job,\n      graduated from high school, and how he was honorably discharged,\n      how he did live his good life. . . . Those are the types of things that\n      we thought would be better, so that’s—granted, when he was young\n      he had a criminal record but he had 15 years of living, you know, a\n      hard-working productive life; he had one job, I think, for eight years.\n      This is a guy who on that particular day was not the person that he had\n      been for 15 years, and we felt that as a matter of strategy, and a matter\n      of tactic, that’s what we wanted to present to the jury. You convicted\n      him. Now let’s look at this: He served his country, worked, and took\n      care of his 79-year-old father.\n\n      Although during his pretrial investigation Salnick had discovered evidence\n\nthat Pooler had a bad temper, a violent background, and had been known to argue\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 26 of 58\n\nwith people and carry a gun, Salnick “certainly didn’t want that to come in” during\n\nthe penalty phase, for Salnick’s plan was “to show the human being that [Pooler]\n\nwas and could still be if [his] life was spared.”\n\n      Salnick’s investigator Marvin Jenne also described the pretrial investigation.\n\nJenne and Pooler “got along pretty good all the time” and “had a good personal\n\nworking relationship.” Jenne tried to corroborate all the background information\n\nhe received from Pooler by talking with other persons.\n\n      Pooler’s 3.850 counsel also called West Palm Beach Police Detective\n\nFrancisco Alonso, who testified that on the day of Brown’s murder, at 6:30 a.m.,\n\nhe took a report from Pooler that $301 had been stolen from his wallet. Pooler said\n\nhe was sitting in his car with a girlfriend’s friend, fell asleep, and awoke to find his\n\nwallet missing.\n\n      Although Detective Alonso’s report stated that Pooler had fallen asleep from\n\nintoxication before the alleged theft at 3:00 a.m., when Pooler arrived to make the\n\nreport, he did not appear drunk. Pooler “smelled like he [had been] drinking,\n\nsmelled like alcohol but he was coherent, he wasn’t slurring his speech, he was\n\nattentive, and [he] gave [Detective Alonso] the exact . . . amount of $301.”\n\nDetective Alonso saw Pooler drive away from the police station, and would not\n\nhave let him drive if he had thought Pooler was still intoxicated.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 27 of 58\n\n      Psychologist Dr. Michael Brannon, Pooler’s final 3.850 witness, evaluated\n\nPooler and administered an intelligence test. Pooler received an IQ score of 75,\n\nwhich put him in the borderline range. Dr. Brannon found that Pooler was\n\ncompetent to proceed. Dr. Brannon believed that, in his self-reporting of his\n\nbackground, Pooler was confabulating—that is, not outright lying but filling in the\n\ngaps in one’s memory with inaccurate information.\n\n      Dr. Brannon believed Pooler “had a severe alcohol problem,” a “high\n\nprobability of severe substance dependency,” and alcohol dependency disorders.\n\nDr. Brannon summarized his areas of concern: (1) Pooler’s IQ, which fell in the\n\nborderline range based on current and past testing; (2) Pooler’s neuro-\n\npsychological deficits, as shown in Dr. Levine’s report; (3) Pooler’s alcohol\n\ndependence and abuse; and (4) the possibility, which more investigation would be\n\nneeded to confirm, that Pooler had post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) from\n\nVietnam. Pooler “certainly shows extreme traumatic stress-like reactions,” but Dr.\n\nBrannon did not know whether they rose to the level of PTSD.\n\nK.    3.850 Court’s Denial of Pooler’s 3.850 Motion\n\n      The 3.850 court denied Pooler’s 3.850 motion. The 3.850 court found that\n\nSalnick conducted a reasonable investigation and that Salnick’s strategy at the\n\npenalty phase was “to present the defendant in a positive light, that he had been a\n\nproductive member of society.” This strategy was “in direct contrast” with\n\n\n                                         27\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 28 of 58\n\nPooler’s 3.850 contention that the defense should have offered less-flattering-to-\n\nPooler evidence at the penalty phase, but “[m]ere disagreement with trial strategy\n\ndoes not amount to a basis for postconviction relief.”\n\n      The 3.850 court concluded, “It is clear from the evidence presented that trial\n\ncounsel conducted a reasonable investigation, and when written documentation\n\nwas not available, [an] alternate means of corroboration was found (i.e., family\n\nmembers).” In light of Salnick’s investigation and chosen penalty-phase strategy,\n\nand “given the corroboration obtained from family members, the failure to obtain\n\n[Pooler’s] military and employment records was not prejudicial.”\n\n      As to the mental health experts, the 3.850 court observed that Salnick “opted\n\nto present the testimony” of the experts, Drs. Levine, Desormeau, Armstrong, and\n\nAlexander, who evaluated Pooler “for competency purposes and mental health\n\nissues for the court and in the jail.” Moreover, “information regarding [Pooler’s]\n\nschool, military and employment history was given to the mental health experts,”\n\nand “jail and medical records as well as the fact that there was no prior report of\n\npsychiatric treatment were given to the experts.” The 3.850 court found that\n\nPooler “failed to meet his burden under Strickland.”\n\n      As to Salnick’s not presenting intoxication evidence, the 3.850 court noted\n\nthat: (1) Salnick successfully used evidence of Pooler’s intoxication a week before\n\nthe murder, when Pooler threatened Brown in his statement to witness Carolyn\n\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 29 of 58\n\nGlass, to preclude the State from obtaining an instruction on the cold, calculated,\n\nand premeditated (“CCP”) aggravating circumstance; (2) Salnick reviewed and\n\ndiscussed with Pooler the contents of Detective Alonso’s police report regarding\n\nthe theft of money from Pooler a few hours before the murder, which stated that\n\nPooler fell asleep from intoxication at 3:00 a.m.; (3) the murder occurred between\n\n8:00 and 9:00 a.m., five to six hours after Pooler fell asleep and about two hours\n\nafter Pooler reported the theft to Detective Alonso; (4) the police report did not\n\nindicate Pooler was drunk when he filed the report; (5) Pooler could recall specific\n\ndetails about the day of the murder; and (6) Salnick was aware of the possibility of\n\npresenting evidence of intoxication but decided not to do so. The 3.850 court also\n\npointed out Detective Alonso’s testimony that Pooler did not appear impaired\n\nwhile filing the report and Detective Alonso knowingly permitted Pooler to drive\n\naway from the police station.\n\n      In sum, the 3.850 court found that Pooler had failed “to prove that trial\n\ncounsel did not properly investigate mitigating factors to present to the court and\n\nthe jury” at the penalty phase. The 3.850 court stated:\n\n      After applying the “highly deferential” scrutiny to counsel’s strategic\n      decisions as required by Strickland, the court finds that the defendant\n      has failed to prove that his attorney’s representation fell below an\n      objective standard of reasonableness and that there was a reasonable\n      probability that the results of the proceeding would have been\n      different but for counsel’s strategic decisions.\n\nL.    3.850 Appeal\n\n                                          29\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 30 of 58\n\n      Pooler appealed the denial of his 3.850 motion to the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt, which affirmed. Pooler v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1853745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1853745/pooler-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2008) (“Pooler II”).\n\n      The Florida Supreme Court divided Pooler’s penalty phase ineffective\n\ncounsel claim into three sub-parts: (1) failure to investigate and present evidence of\n\nPooler’s alcohol abuse or dependency; (2) failure to investigate and present\n\nPooler’s school, military, and employment records; and (3) failure to retain mental\n\nhealth experts and provide them with adequate background information. Id. at 464.\n\n      As to alcohol abuse or dependency, the Florida Supreme Court concluded\n\nthat Pooler had not shown either deficient performance or prejudice:\n\n      First, Salnick’s performance was not deficient. . . . Salnick conducted\n      a reasonable investigation into Pooler’s background. Neither Pooler\n      nor his family indicated to Salnick that he had a substance abuse\n      problem or that he had been drinking at the time of the shooting.\n      However, Salnick discovered that Pooler had been drinking two days\n      before the murder when he threatened to kill Kim Brown. He used this\n      information during the penalty phase to prevent the State from\n      obtaining an instruction on CCP. Further, Salnick testified at the\n      evidentiary hearing that he chose not to introduce Pooler’s police\n      report during the penalty phase because it would open the door for the\n      State to cross-examine Pooler regarding the fact that he had been with\n      a prostitute when he passed out drunk and that she stole his money.\n      This was a reasonable tactical decision made after a reasonable\n      investigation; therefore, Salnick’s performance was not deficient.\n      Moreover, . . . none of the evidence introduced by Pooler at the\n      evidentiary hearing shows that he was intoxicated at the time of the\n      murder. Therefore, any alleged failure on Salnick’s part to investigate\n      and present it at trial was not prejudicial.\n\nId. at 466-67 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 31 of 58\n\n      As to the school, military, and employment records, the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that Salnick’s pre-trial investigation was reasonable given that\n\nPooler’s family members corroborated what Pooler self-reported on these subjects:\n\n      Salnick conducted a reasonable investigation. His failure to obtain\n      Pooler’s records does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance.\n      Pooler consistently represented to Salnick that he was an average\n      student, graduated from high school, and was honorably discharged\n      from the Marine Corps. To test the validity of Pooler’s\n      representations, Salnick’s investigator, Marvin Jenne, traveled to\n      Louisiana and interviewed members of Pooler’s family. All of the\n      family members Jenne located and interviewed corroborated Pooler’s\n      positive representations. Further, Jenne made an attempt, albeit\n      unsuccessful, to obtain Pooler’s school records. Based on Pooler’s\n      positive representations of himself which were substantiated by his\n      family members, Salnick had no reason to believe Pooler’s records\n      would contain anything negative or mitigating. Therefore, he formed a\n      reasonable trial strategy of presenting Pooler in a positive light.\n\nId. at 467 (citation omitted). Thus, Pooler did not satisfy the deficient performance\n\nprong of the ineffective assistance test. Id.\n\n      The Florida Supreme Court also found that Pooler failed to show prejudice\n\ngiven the mitigating evidence Salnick did introduce, Salnick’s trial strategy, and\n\nthat the additional evidence in these records was a double-edged sword and would\n\nhave undermined Pooler’s other mitigating evidence:\n\n      Moreover, no prejudice resulted from counsel’s choice of strategy. At\n      trial, Salnick showed that Pooler had been a productive member of\n      society and crime-free for fifteen years prior to the murder. He\n      presented evidence that Pooler had served honorably in the military in\n      Vietnam, reenlisted, raised a daughter, took care of his relatives, was a\n      good parent, worked at the same job for eight years, and was well\n      liked by his coworkers. Of all the mitigation presented, the trial court\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 32 of 58\n\n      gave considerable weight only to Pooler’s honorable military service.\n      Had Salnick introduced Pooler’s military, school, or employment\n      records, he would have undermined Pooler’s only significant\n      mitigation. See Reed v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1695833\"><a href=\"/opinion/1695833/reed-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (Fla. 2004) (“An\n      ineffective assistance claim does not arise from the failure to present\n      mitigation evidence where that evidence presents a double-edged\n      sword.”). Furthermore, Pooler’s records would not have opened up\n      mitigation leads sufficient to overcome the aggravation found by the\n      trial court. Accordingly, counsel’s failure to obtain these records does\n      not undermine confidence in Pooler’s death sentence.\n\nId. at 467–68.\n\n      The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the 3.850 court’s denial of Pooler’s\n\nclaim about the mental health experts. Id. at 469. The Florida Supreme Court\n\nconcluded that Salnick’s performance was reasonable:\n\n      Salnick reasonably relied on Pooler’s corroborated representations\n      regarding his scholastic and military background. Salnick\n      communicated this information to the experts, and Pooler also gave\n      the experts the same information during their evaluations of him.\n      Furthermore, Salnick testified at the evidentiary hearing that he\n      retained these experts because, given their neutrality, they would be\n      more credible and difficult to impeach. This was a reasonable\n      strategic decision.\n\nId. (citation omitted). The Florida Supreme Court also concluded that, even\n\nassuming Salnick’s performance were deficient, Pooler did not show prejudice:\n\n      Even if we assume counsel’s decision to forego further testing\n      constituted deficient performance, Pooler failed to establish that any\n      prejudice resulted from it. He presented no evidence that the defense\n      experts were incompetent or that they failed to assist in the evaluation,\n      preparation, and presentation of the defense. Nor did Pooler identify\n      anything of substance that a more in-depth psychoanalysis would have\n      added. [3.850 expert] Dr. Brannon’s finding that Pooler had\n      neurological damage from head injuries was already indicated in Dr.\n                                         32\n\f              Case: 12-12059    Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 33 of 58\n\n      Levine’s evaluation. Also, Dr. Brannon’s determination that Pooler\n      had a borderline retarded IQ of 75 does not constitute a clear\n      indication of actual mental retardation because it is within the range\n      estimated by Dr. Alexander and is not substantially inconsistent with\n      the trial court’s finding that Pooler had an IQ of 80.

Under the Strickland test,\n\nfor a convicted defendant to show that he received constitutionally ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, he must show that (1) his attorney’s performance was\n\ndeficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. A court need not “address both components of\n\n\n                                         34\n\f               Case: 12-12059   Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 35 of 58\n\nthe inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.” Id. at 697, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

The\n\nquestion is “whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or\n\nomissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.”\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. In answering this question, we\n\nemploy a highly deferential review of counsel’s conduct, for “we must indulge a\n\nstrong presumption that counsel’s performance was reasonable and that counsel\n\nmade all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.”\n\nRhode v.

In short, Pooler “must establish that no\n\ncompetent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.” Id.\n\n(quoting Newland, 527 F.3d at 1184).\n\n      Attorneys have a duty to conduct reasonable pretrial investigations.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690–91, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. The Strickland Court\n\nexplained:\n\n      [S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts\n      relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and\n                                          35\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 36 of 58\n\n      strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are\n      reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n      judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words,\n      counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\n      reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\n      In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate\n      must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,\n      applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments.\n\nId.\n\n      Furthermore, “[t]he reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be determined\n\nor substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions,” for\n\nattorneys—usually, and “quite properly”—base their actions “on information\n\nsupplied by the defendant.” Id. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. “In particular, what\n\ninvestigation decisions are reasonable depends critically” upon information the\n\ndefendant furnishes to his counsel. Id. The Supreme Court in Strickland noted\n\nthat, “when the facts that support a certain potential line of defense are generally\n\nknown to counsel because of what the defendant has said, the need for further\n\ninvestigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether.” Id.\n\nTherefore, “inquiry into counsel’s conversations with the defendant may be critical\n\nto a proper assessment of counsel’s investigation decisions.” Id.\n\n      For prejudice, the standard is whether “there is a reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different.” Rose v.

Ct. at 778. If any such reasonable argument exists, then Pooler\n\ncannot prevail.\n\nB.    Performance: Investigation\n\n      Pooler argues that Salnick rendered ineffective assistance during the penalty\n\nphase investigation by relying on Pooler’s own statements about his background\n\nwithout obtaining the school, military, and employment records that would have\n\nshown Pooler’s positive statements about his background and achievements were\n\nuntrue. The Florida Supreme Court rejected this contention and found Salnick’s\n\npenalty-phase preparation was reasonable under the circumstances. Pooler II, 980\n\nSo. 2d at 467. The Florida Supreme Court’s decision is not contrary to, or based\n\non an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. Nor is it based on an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts.\n\n      It was not unreasonable for the Florida Supreme Court to conclude, based on\n\nthe evidence presented at trial and in the 3.850 proceedings, that Salnick’s\n\ninvestigation of mitigating evidence, and his strategic decisions about what\n\nevidence to present in the penalty phase, fell within “the wide range of\n\nprofessionally competent assistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at\n\n2066. The facts show that Salnick, an experienced criminal defense attorney,\n\n\n                                           38\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 39 of 58\n\nretained Jenne, a veteran investigator, to help with the mitigation search, and\n\nSalnick instructed Jenne to find “anything and everything” he could about Pooler.\n\nThe two men began by speaking with Pooler himself, who furnished them with\n\ninformation and with names of witnesses. According to Salnick, Pooler had no\n\ntrouble sharing information, and Jenne thought he and Pooler had a “good personal\n\nworking relationship.”\n\n      Nevertheless, Salnick and Jenne did not simply take Pooler’s information at\n\nface value. They interviewed the witnesses Pooler identified. Jenne testified he\n\nknew that criminal defendants often don’t tell their attorneys and investigators the\n\nfull truth, and he made an effort to corroborate all the information Pooler gave him.\n\n      Importantly, Salnick and Jenne testified that they tried to get these records\n\nPooler claims they should have obtained. Salnick testified they tried to get Pooler’s\n\nmilitary records, but were unsuccessful. Jenne testified that he made telephone\n\ncalls and sent letters requesting Pooler’s school records, but he was told they were\n\nunavailable. Jenne tried to get Pooler’s employment records also, and did get the\n\nones from local employers, but could not obtain the records from Louisiana.\n\n      When Salnick and Jenne could not get the requested records, they sought\n\nalternative corroboration from Pooler’s close relatives, who could reasonably be\n\nexpected to know the details of Pooler’s background. Only after they obtained that\n\ncorroboration did they present the evidence at trial.\n\n\n                                          39\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 40 of 58\n\n      It was not unreasonable, or contrary to Supreme Court precedent, for the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court to find that counsel’s performance as to these records was\n\nnot deficient under Strickland. Salnick and his investigator Jenne did try to get the\n\ncorroborating records, and when they could not, they tried to—and did—obtain\n\nconfirmation through other means. See Housel v.

Significantly, Pooler presents\n\nno evidence, other than the fact that his 3.850 counsel obtained the records and\n\ntrial counsel did not, tending to show that the efforts trial counsel actually made to\n\ntry to get the records were unreasonably deficient.

The record reveals that this\n\nwas a conscious, strategic decision by Salnick, one that the Florida Supreme Court\n\nexpressly found to be reasonable. Pooler II, 980 So. 2d at 469. Salnick testified\n\nthat he had “a bunch” of strategic reasons for choosing to rely, in the penalty\n\nphase, on Dr. Levine and Dr. Alexander, including that they would be more\n\ncredible to the jury because they were hired by the court and not the defense team.\n\nSalnick also said that he did not hire a defense mental health expert to do a\n\nmitigation-related evaluation because of what he already had for the penalty phase.\n\nSalnick believed Dr. Levine’s and Dr. Alexander’s conclusions dovetailed with his\n\nchosen penalty-phase strategy of presenting evidence that would humanize Pooler\n\nand portray him as a man who worked hard, served his country, and was good to\n\nhis family.\n\n      Under the particular circumstances here, it was neither unreasonable nor\n\ncontrary to Supreme Court precedent for the Florida Supreme Court to conclude\n\nthat a reasonable attorney could have decided, as Salnick did, to rely on the two\n\nexperts here. Those circumstances include the facts that: (1) trial counsel was\n\nalready performing a mitigation investigation into Pooler’s background, including\n\nan inquiry into his medical and psychological history; and (2) well before trial,\n\ncounsel read the reports from, and heard the competency-hearing testimony of,\n\nmultiple experts who had evaluated Pooler’s then-current mental functioning.

Here, the two experts\n\nadministered neuropsychological and intelligence tests and reported that Pooler\n\nhad: (1) a low-average to borderline intelligence level, with an overall IQ around\n\n80; (2) poor reading ability; (3) sub-optimal attention functioning; (4) no prior\n\npsychiatric treatment except for the treatment for depression after his arrest; (5)\n\npossible hypothyroidism and psychomotor retardation; (6) suffered head trauma 30\n\nyears before in a car accident, but with no cognitive or thinking ability changes\n\nfollowing it; (7) intact memory function, with no delusions or confusion; (8) no\n\nevident symptoms of mental illness; and (9) no signs of long-term mental illness or\n\ndisturbance existing at the time of Brown’s murder. 12 The two experts inquired\n\n\n\n       12\n         Dr. Silversmith believed Pooler had a personality disorder of an unspecified type, either\nantisocial or passive dependent (although Dr. Alexander saw no sign of a personality disorder),\nplus an unspecified, non-psychotic mental disorder to which Pooler’s pretrial incarceration may\nhave contributed.

See Housel, 238 F.3d at\n\n1296 (finding no deficient performance in counsel’s failure to investigate and\n\npresent mental health evidence of brain damage and hypoglycemic irritability\n\nepisodes because (1) counsel reviewed two psychological evaluations that did not\n\nsuggest a need to investigate further, (2) the defendant never mentioned his\n\nhypoglycemia to counsel, (3) counsel knew about defendant’s prior head injury but\n\nsaw nothing unusual in defendant’s behavior, and thus, (4) counsel “knew enough\n\nabout [the defendant’s] mental health reasonably to conclude that further\n\ninvestigation would not bear fruit”); see also Newland, 527 F.3d at 1213–14.\n\nD.    Performance: Alcohol Use\n\n      Pooler also argued that Salnick performed unreasonably because he failed to\n\nfollow up on information about Pooler’s nephew Brian Warren and Pooler’s\n\nalleged use of alcohol on the day of the murder. As to this contention, the Florida\n\n\n                                         46\n\f              Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 47 of 58\n\nSupreme Court decision was likewise reasonable and not contrary to prior holdings\n\nof the United States Supreme Court.\n\n       Regarding Brian Warren, it is undisputed that Salnick and Jenne interviewed\n\na number of Pooler’s relatives, including Pooler’s father, brother, and sister, and\n\nthat Jenne spent three days in Louisiana speaking with persons who knew Pooler.13\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “there comes a point at which evidence\n\nfrom more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and\n\nthe search for it distractive from more important duties.” Bobby v.

Salnick and Jenne interviewed\n\na number of witnesses, including Pooler’s relatives and employers, about Pooler’s\n\nuse of alcohol. Salnick obtained the police report about the theft Pooler reported\n\non the day of the murder—which said Pooler “fell asleep due to intoxication”—\n\n\n\n\n       13\n          Jenne may have spoken with Pooler’s nephew Darren Warren, too. Jenne’s invoice\nshows a phone call placed to Darren Warren on April 25, 1995. However, Darren Warren’s\ndeclaration states that he was never contacted by Pooler’s defense team. Because Darren Warren\ndid not testify at the 3.850 hearing and Jenne was not asked about the phone call, a factual\ndispute remains.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 48 of 58\n\nand spoke to Pooler about it. 14 Pooler told Salnick that the woman who allegedly\n\nrobbed him was a prostitute, and Salnick did not want to open the door to that fact\n\ncoming before the jury, stating that “[t]here is no way I would have done that. I\n\njust didn’t think it was appropriate.”\n\n       More generally, presenting evidence of Pooler’s alcohol use may not have\n\nbeen mitigating in the jury’s eyes, and may well have opened the door not only to\n\nevidence of Pooler’s cavorting with a prostitute hours before he brutally killed his\n\nex-girlfriend, but also to the abundant evidence of Pooler’s bad temper and\n\npropensity to violence when he was drunk.

Salnick too testified that he had discovered evidence that Pooler\n\nhad a bad temper, a violent background, and was known to argue with people and\n\ncarry a gun.16 Admitting such testimony would have negated Salnick’s successful\n\nattempt at keeping this harmful information from the jury.\n\n       Other 3.850 evidence Pooler claims Salnick should have presented was\n\nmerely cumulative to evidence Salnick already put on.

More to the point, we conclude that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision\n\nthat Pooler did not satisfy Strickland’s prejudice prong was not contrary to\n\nSupreme Court precedent, did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent,\n\nand was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nstate-court evidence.\n\nF.     Pooler’s Reliance on Porter\n\n       We also reject all of Pooler’s arguments that are based on Porter v.\n\nMcCollum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, we point out that the\n\n\n\n       17\n         In fact, notwithstanding Pooler’s arguments that Salnick’s performance was deficient\nfor not obtaining a mitigation-specific expert evaluation of Pooler, Dr. Brannon conducted such\nan evaluation and found little that was not already noted by the several competency experts.\n\n\n\n                                               52\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012    Page: 53 of 58\n\nSupreme Court’s 2009 Porter decision was after the Florida Supreme Court’s 2008\n\ndecision in Pooler II, and thus Porter itself does not constitute clearly established\n\nfederal law for § 2254(d) purposes for Pooler’s case. Thus, the issue is not\n\nwhether the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Pooler II was contrary to or an\n\nunreasonable application of Porter, but whether the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nPorter illustrates that the Florida Supreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland\n\nor some other pre-Pooler II holding of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n      Second, and in any event, the factual differences between the two cases—as\n\nto both the performance and prejudice prongs of the ineffective-counsel analysis—\n\nare substantial and numerous. For example, Porter’s counsel at the penalty phase\n\ncalled only one witness (Porter’s ex-wife) and presented almost no mitigating\n\nevidence at all. Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 449. The penalty phase evidence “left the jury\n\nknowing hardly anything about [Porter] other than the facts of his crimes.” Id.\n\n      By contrast, Pooler’s counsel Salnick called four mental health experts\n\n(neuropsychologist Levine, psychologist Alexander, and jail psychiatrists\n\nDesormeau and Armstrong), jail officer Arthur Rock, Pooler’s friend and co-\n\nworker Alice Bradford, and three of Pooler’s family members (his brother, sister,\n\nand father). These witnesses told the jury, among other things, that Pooler: (1) had\n\nan IQ around 80, in the low-average to mildly impaired range, and a third-grade\n\nreading level; (2) suffered depressive symptoms in jail, but behaved well there; (3)\n\n\n                                          53\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 54 of 58\n\nwas a reliable and punctual employee of the same employer for seven years; (4)\n\nhelped Bradford, a single parent, with yard work; (5) was nice, polite, and\n\nrespectful to Bradford and she trusted him around her son; (6) grew up in a close,\n\nsupportive, religious family; (7) was a good father to his four daughters; (8) served\n\nmore than six years in the United States Marine Corps, including service in\n\nVietnam; and (9) had problems, including temper problems, after he returned from\n\nVietnam. The jury heard much that would humanize Pooler, but nevertheless\n\nrecommended that Pooler receive the death penalty.\n\n      Third, Porter materially differs from the instant case because in Porter, the\n\nSupreme Court decided the performance prong de novo, without AEDPA\n\ndeference. See id. at 452. And Porter’s trial counsel’s penalty-phase preparation\n\nwas plainly deficient. As the Supreme Court noted, Porter’s counsel: (1) “had\n\nonly one short meeting with Porter regarding the penalty phase”; (2) did not\n\ninterview Porter’s family members; (3) did not ever request Porter’s school,\n\nmilitary, and medical records; (4) ignored avenues of investigation revealed by the\n\ncourt-ordered competency evaluations, which “reported Porter’s very few years of\n\nregular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his\n\nfather’s ‘over-discipline’”; and (5) told the jury that “Porter was not ‘mentally\n\nhealthy’” but did not present any mental health evidence. Id. at 449, 453 (brackets\n\nomitted). Here, not only do we have a decision of the Florida Supreme Court on\n\n\n                                          54\n\f             Case: 12-12059      Date Filed: 12/17/2012   Page: 55 of 58\n\ncounsel’s performance to which we must defer under AEDPA, but the evidence\n\nrecounted above demonstrates that trial counsel Salnick investigated mitigating\n\nevidence much more thoroughly and presented much more of what he found.\n\n      Further, as to prejudice, the mitigating evidence adduced in Porter’s 3.850\n\nproceedings was far more powerful than that present here. In Porter, unlike this\n\ncase, there was evidence of extensive childhood physical abuse: Porter’s father\n\nroutinely beat Porter’s mother in Porter’s presence, despite Porter’s attempts to\n\nprotect her, and Porter himself was a “favorite target” of his father’s abuse. Id. at\n\n449. Porter’s father beat Porter and, at least once, shot at him with a gun. Id.\n\nAccording to Porter’s siblings, Porter’s father “was violent every weekend.” Id.\n\nPorter’s case also featured expert testimony that Porter had brain damage, which is\n\nnot present in this case. Id. at 451.\n\n      Additionally, Porter’s 3.850 hearing featured detailed and moving testimony\n\nabout Porter’s military service from Porter’s company commander. Id. at 450.\n\nThis testimony revealed that: (1) Porter enlisted in the Army at age 17 and served\n\nin the Korean War; (2) at the battle of Kunu-ri, Porter’s unit fought in bitter cold,\n\nwith little or no food or sleep through five days of combat, all of which Porter\n\nendured while having a gunshot wound in his leg; (3) Porter’s unit then “engaged\n\nin a ‘fierce hand-to-hand fight’” with the enemy before finally receiving\n\npermission to withdraw; (4) less than three months later, Porter fought at the battle\n\n\n                                          55\n\f               Case: 12-12059       Date Filed: 12/17/2012       Page: 56 of 58\n\nof Chip’yong-ni, during which Porter’s regiment “was cut off from the rest of the\n\nEighth Army and defended itself for two days and two nights under constant fire”;\n\n(5) Porter’s company was ordered to charge the enemy’s defensive positions on\n\nhigh ground, during which the company came under heavy mortar, artillery, and\n\nmachine gun fire; (6) Porter’s company suffered more than 50% casualties in the\n\nbattle, and Porter himself was wounded again; and (7) for his wartime military\n\nservice, Porter was awarded two Purple Hearts, the Combat Infantryman Badge,\n\nand other decorations, and his unit received the Presidential Unit Citation for its\n\nperformance at Chip’yong-ni. Id. at 449–50.\n\n       In contrast, Pooler’s 3.850 proceedings produced no evidence of childhood\n\nphysical abuse and much less detailed evidence of Pooler’s wartime service in\n\nVietnam. Pooler’s military records did show that he participated in counter-\n\ninsurgency and combat operations and was awarded three basic service medals.\n\nBut no one with first-hand knowledge of Pooler’s wartime service testified on his\n\nbehalf either at trial or in the 3.850 proceedings. 18\n\n       And Pooler’s military records show that he was frequently the subject of\n\nmilitary discipline. While both Porter and Pooler were disciplined for being absent\n\n\n\n       18\n           As to adjustment problems after wartime, the Supreme Court noted that “Porter’s expert\ntestified that [Porter’s] symptoms would easily warrant a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress\ndisorder.” Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 450 n.4. Pooler’s 3.850 expert Dr. Brannon, however, could not\nsay whether Pooler’s symptoms actually rose to the level of PTSD.\n\n\n                                               56\n\f             Case: 12-12059     Date Filed: 12/17/2012      Page: 57 of 58\n\nwithout leave (“AWOL”), Pooler’s infractions were more numerous and serious.\n\nPorter went AWOL twice while in Korea—for which he was not punished at all\n\nbecause unauthorized absences in the field were not uncommon occurrences in\n\nwartime and sometimes were unintentional—and once back in the United States in\n\norder to see his son. Id. at 450 & n.3. Pooler, on the other hand, was found\n\nAWOL six times in one year, and was also punished for using disrespectful\n\nlanguage to a superior officer and for refusing to obey orders. As the Florida\n\nSupreme Court noted in Pooler II, “Pooler’s military records revealed that he was\n\ncharged with at least nineteen different offenses on fifteen different occasions\n\nbetween October 1969 and February 1971 and that he was court-martialed for\n\nseveral of these offenses.” Pooler II, 980 So. 2d at 467.\n\n      Therefore, Porter presented a far more mitigating evidentiary profile than\n\nthis case does. In Porter, the penalty-phase jury heard almost nothing of Porter\n\nexcept his crimes, but could have—and should have—been presented with\n\npersuasive evidence of Porter’s extensive childhood abuse, his potential brain\n\ndamage, and his heroic military service under horrific conditions, which left him\n\nphysically and mentally wounded. In Pooler, though, the jury already heard about\n\nPooler’s close family life; his low intelligence; his being a good father, friend, and\n\nemployee; and his voluntary service in the Vietnam War and its negative effect on\n\nhim. And Pooler’s counsel successfully kept the jury from hearing significant\n\n\n                                          57\n\f               Case: 12-12059        Date Filed: 12/17/2012        Page: 58 of 58\n\nnegative evidence that was later adduced in the 3.850 proceedings and that is not\n\npresent in Porter: for example, that Pooler was aggressive and short-tempered, that\n\nmost of his co-workers did not want to work with him, that Pooler was known to\n\ncarry a gun and brandish it during arguments, that Pooler spent time with a\n\nprostitute hours before murdering his ex-girlfriend Brown, that Pooler was\n\nfrequently disciplined in the Army, that Pooler was an indifferent student, and that\n\nPooler’s own family members were afraid of him when he drank, which was\n\nfrequently.\n\n       Simply put, Porter does not show that the Florida Supreme Court in Pooler II\n\nunreasonably applied Strickland or any other pre-existing United States Supreme\n\nCourt holding. 19\n\n                                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court’s denial of\n\nPooler’s § 2254 petition.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n       19\n          Pooler also relies on Sears v. Upton, — U.S. —, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149653\"><a href=\"/opinion/149653/sears-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010), but that case is\nmaterially different, too. Sears’s counsel performed only a cursory mitigation investigation and\npresented evidence only about the defendant’s middle-class upbringing and the potential effect of\na death sentence on his family. Id. at 3261–62. Counsel failed to discover, or present, any\nevidence about the defendant being abused as a child or his substantial cognitive impairments.\nId. at 3262–64. And most importantly, the Sears Court did not conclude that the defendant had\nsatisfied the Strickland prejudice prong. Id. at 3267. It merely found that the state court\nmisapplied Strickland and remanded for further proceedings. See id. (“It is for the state court . . .\nto undertake this [Strickland prejudice prong] reweighing in the first instance.”).\n\n\n                                                 58\n\f</pre>",
