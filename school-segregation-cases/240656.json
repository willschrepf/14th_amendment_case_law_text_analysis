App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court is Affirmed.\n\nN ORMA M CG EE O GLE, delivered the opinion of the Court, in which J ERRY L. S MITH and\nJ OHN E VERETT W ILLIAMS, JJ., joined.\n\nBenjamin L. McGowan, Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the appellant, Ladarius Tyree Springs.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; Leslie E. Price, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; William H. Cox, District Attorney General; and C. Matthew Rogers, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                          OPINION\n\n       The Hamilton County grand jury indicted the then eighteen-year-old defendant for one\ncount of aggravated burglary and two counts of aggravated robbery occurring on December\n19, 2007. On August 1, 2008, the defendant pled guilty to one count of aggravated burglary\nand the remaining counts were dismissed. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the trial court\nsentenced the defendant to six years as a Range I, standard offender to be served on\n\fsupervised probation following the service of eleven months and twenty-nine days\nincarceration. At sentencing, the defendant received pretrial jail credit from December 19,\n2007 until August 1, 2008.\n\n       On September 4, 2008, the defendant was arrested for simple assault, to which he\nultimately pled guilty. A violation of probation report followed based upon this new arrest.\nFollowing the revocation of the defendant’s probation, on August 31, 2009, the trial court\nentered an amended judgment sentencing the defendant to six years to be served on\ncommunity corrections. On November 4, 2009, the trial court rescinded the community\ncorrections order after the defendant was unable to find a community corrections program\nthat would accept him. On March 15, 2010, the trial court entered a second amended\njudgment ordering the defendant to serve his six year sentence in the custody of the\nTennessee Department of Correction, with applicable jail credit. This timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n        At the February 23, 2009 revocation hearing, the State presented the testimony of\nDavid Lane, an officer with the Tennessee Department of Probation and Parole. Mr. Lane\ntestified that he had supervised the defendant’s probationary sentence. He said that he had\nan opportunity to meet with the defendant only two times before he was arrested for assault.\nAlthough he had never had the chance to visit the defendant’s home, Mr. Lane alleged a\ncurfew violation in the violation of probation report based upon the defendant’s arrest\noccurring at 3:00 a.m. Mr. Lane testified that the arrest report for the assault indicated that\nthe defendant had participated “in a group assault” that did not involve weapons or alcohol.\n\n       The defendant admitted at the hearing that he had violated the terms of his probation.\nHe acknowledged Mr. Lane’s testimony as true and accurate. He explained that his parents\n“weren’t really there for [him]” growing up. He said that he was placed in foster care when\nhe was ten or eleven years old because his mother “wasn’t doing what she was supposed to\ndo” concerning the care of him and his six siblings and because she “got on drugs real bad.”\nHis father was “in and out of jail” throughout his childhood.\n\n        The defendant testified that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder. He said that intelligence testing during school showed that his\nintelligence quotient (IQ) “wasn’t right all the way up there.” 1\n\n       The defendant told the court that he knew that he had “messed up . . . [but he had]\nbeen sitting behind that wall thinking it’s time for [him] to grow up and be a real man.” He\nexplained that he had been employed at several restaurants while in high school and that he\n\n       1\n           When asked by the trial court, defense counsel said that the defendant had an IQ of 71.\n\n                                                    -2-\n\fwanted to obtain his general equivalency diploma (GED) if returned to probation. He said\nthat he did not want to go to prison because he was frightened by stories he had heard about\nit. On cross-examination, the defendant denied that the assault involved any gang activity.\nHe also said that he did not use alcohol or illegal drugs.\n\n         When questioned by the trial court, the defendant said that he would live with his\nsister if granted probation. He acknowledged that the assault arrest occurred within a month\nof being placed on probation.\n\n        At the conclusion of the February 23, 2009 revocation hearing, the trial court found\nthat the defendant had violated the terms of his probation by the new arrest and by being out\npast curfew. He reserved the sentencing issue to allow the defendant an “opportunity to look\ninto some kind of a residential program . . . where he’s going to have some sort of structure.”\nThe trial court added that “although I think punitive measures are necessary, I want to try to\ngive him the opportunity to do something with some structure before I do send him on to that\n[prison] environment.” The trial court stated that it “looked at him on the witness stand and\nI don’t really want to send him to the penitentiary at what he presented here . . . . I will send\nhim if he doesn’t . . . show anything any better than what he’s shown so far.”\n\n       As previously discussed, the record reveals that the defendant was placed on\ncommunity corrections supervision in August 2009. However, the trial court rescinded its\nAugust 21, 2009 order on November 4, 2009 based upon a determination by community\ncorrections personnel that the defendant could not be placed in their program.2 On March\n15, 2010, an additional hearing was held concerning the defendant’s sentence. From this\nhearing, we can glean that the defendant had spent a substantial amount of time, “about two\nyears,” in the custody of the Hamilton County Jail.\n\n        Michelle Johnson, an internal affairs investigator with “the local CCA Silverdale\nfacility” – a community corrections agency, testified that she investigated an incident that led\nto the defendant being transferred from the facility back to the jail. She said that on\nDecember 26, 2009, the defendant was involved in an altercation with seven to eight inmates.\nThe defendant swung “what appeared to be a lock in a sock” at several inmates. Ms. Johnson\nconducted a search of the defendant’s cell and discovered the “lock in a sock” and several\ngang-related notes indicating that the defendant was a member of the Traveling Vice Lords.\nThe defendant was transferred to the jail based upon this incident and “numerous disciplinary\nproblems,” which had required him to be housed in the segregation unit eight times.\n\n\n\n        2\n        It appears from the record that these actions all occurred via court order and that no hearings were\nheld. There are no transcripts relevant to these orders contained in the record on appeal.\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       Hamilton County Sheriff’s Department Deputy Marc Stockman testified that he\nprepared an incident report concerning the defendant on January 10, 2010. The defendant\nand another inmate became involved in an altercation because the other inmate had been\nthrowing urine at the defendant. When the defendant was moved to another location, a\n“plastic shank” was discovered among his personal belongings inside a property box under\nthe defendant’s bed.\n\n        The defendant denied his involvement in the altercation at the community corrections\nfacility. He said that he did not have anything in his hand. He denied ownership of the “lock\nin the sock” and implied that it could have belonged to someone else because it was a two-\nman cell. He denied ownership of the shank found in his property box at the jail. The\ndefendant said that he had “been controlling [his] temper since [he] got locked up” and that\nhe wanted a chance at probation. However, he admitted that he had verbally threatened a\nguard in February 2010 because the guard “made [him] mad.”\n\n        Defense counsel acknowledged that the trial court had allowed some opportunity to\naddress the defendant’s rehabilitative needs but that nothing was “to be found in our current\nsystem.” Defense counsel asked the trial court to place the defendant on intensive probation\nso that the defendant could address these needs outside the penitentiary setting.\n\n       The trial court held that intensive probation would not be structured enough for the\ndefendant. The trial court found that the defendant “had indicated that his behavior is so\ndeeply ingrained that he really cannot rehabilitate himself outside of custody without\nendangering himself and others.” The trial court reiterated that the defendant had violated\nthe terms of his probation by his 2008 assault arrest. The trial court imposed a sentence of\nincarceration based upon its concerns that the defendant “presents too much of a danger to\nthe general public to be out on the streets” and that the defendant “really hasn’t proven\nhimself to be a good candidate to be rehabilitated.” The defendant timely appealed this\njudgment.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argues “that he is a good candidate for alternative sentencing\nand that the court erred in discounting his explanations” concerning his misbehavior while\nincarcerated locally. He also contends that the trial court erroneously allowed testimony\nconcerning the altercation at the community corrections facility despite the State’s failure to\nproduce the video recording of the incident. The State responds that there was substantial\nevidence of the defendant’s lack of amenability to rehabilitation upon which to base the trial\ncourt’s decision to order the sentence in confinement. Following our review, we agree with\nthe State.\n\n       Upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a probationer has violated the\n\n                                              -4-\n\fterms of his probation, a trial court is authorized to order him to serve the balance of his\noriginal sentence in confinement. See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-35-310 and -311(e); see also\nState v. Harkins, 811 S.W.2d 79, 82 (Tenn. 1991). Probation revocation rests in the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court and will not be overturned by this court absent an abuse of that\ndiscretion. State v. Leach, 914 S.W.2d 104, 106 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). An abuse of\ndiscretion exists when “the record contains no substantial evidence to support the trial court’s\nconclusion that a violation has occurred.” State v. Conner, 919 S.W.2d 48, 50 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1995).\n\n       It was within the trial court’s authority to order the defendant to serve his original\nsentence upon revoking his probation. See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-35-310 and -311(e); State\nv. Mitchell, 810 S.W.2d 733, 735 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). “[A]n accused, already on\nprobation, is not entitled to a second grant of probation or another form of alternative\nsentencing.” State v. Jeffrey A. Warfield, No. 01C01-9711-CC-00504, 1999 WL 61065, at\n*2 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Feb. 10, 1999); see also State v. Timothy A. Johnson, No.\nM2001-01362-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 242351, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Feb.\n11, 2002).\n\n        There is substantial evidence to support the trial court’s revocation of probation in this\ncase. The defendant admitted to the violations at the February 2009 hearing. When offered\nthe opportunity for a sentence less than confinement in the penitentiary, the defendant\ninvolved himself in further altercations that showed his lack of amenability to rehabilitation.\nFurthermore, we deem the defendant’s argument concerning the State’s failure to produce\nthe video recording unpersuasive. The defendant could have sought the recording through\ndiscovery and presented the same. The trial court limited Ms. Johnson’s testimony to those\nfacts she observed and made findings based upon his credibility determinations of the\nwitnesses. The defendant’s admitted and repeated altercations during the pendency of the\ntrial court’s sentencing decision justify the denial of alternative sentencing in this case.\nTherefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, the\njudgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     NORMA MCGEE OGLE\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f",

Crim. App. at Nashville, Feb.\n11, 2002).\n\n        There is substantial evidence to support the trial court’s revocation of probation in this\ncase. The defendant admitted to the violations at the February 2009 hearing. When offered\nthe opportunity for a sentence less than confinement in the penitentiary, the defendant\ninvolved himself in further altercations that showed his lack of amenability to rehabilitation.\nFurthermore, we deem the defendant’s argument concerning the State’s failure to produce\nthe video recording unpersuasive. The defendant could have sought the recording through\ndiscovery and presented the same. The trial court limited Ms. Johnson’s testimony to those\nfacts she observed and made findings based upon his credibility determinations of the\nwitnesses. The defendant’s admitted and repeated altercations during the pendency of the\ntrial court’s sentencing decision justify the denial of alternative sentencing in this case.\nTherefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, the\njudgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     NORMA MCGEE OGLE\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f</pre>",
