Whether he raises a constitutional challenge to his convictions, and, if so, how we should rule on that challenge, are questions that have divided our panel three ways, as will become clear from our separate writings. Despite this tripartite fractionation, however, different majorities of the panel conclude that (1) the question of &#167; 666's as-applied constitutionality is properly before the panel and should be addressed; (2) the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction of this criminal bribery case against Lipscomb; and (3) the court abused its discretion in transferring the trial <i>sua sponte</i> over Lipscomb's objections. We therefore reverse his conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Lipscomb's conduct and particular jurisdictional facts are important to the varying views of the members of this panel. We therefore recount them in considerable detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Lipscomb's Offense Conduct</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb served on the Dallas City Council (the \"Council\") from 1984 to 1993 and again from 1995 until 2000. During his first period of service, Lipscomb vigorously opposed any measure favorable to taxicab companies, including Yellow Cab and Checker Cab (together, \"Yellow Cab\"), both owned by his co-conspirator, Floyd Richards. Lipscomb's animus against cab companies apparently was grounded in a belief that cab companies perennially failed to serve the minority community adequately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his second period of service on the Council, however, Lipscomb demonstrated a considerably kinder disposition toward cab companies, especially Yellow Cab. In 1994, during Lipscomb's hiatus from the Council, Richards asked Lipscomb to help improve Yellow Cab's reputation in the minority community and offered to pay Lipscomb $1,000 a month in cash for that help. Lipscomb assented to this proposal. Richards and Lipscomb agreed to continue this arrangement as long as it was mutually agreeable. All this transpired orally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richards continued to make the monthly payments to Lipscomb after he was re-elected to the Council. At times, Richards would receive phone calls from Lipscomb indicating that he needed a payment, after which Lipscomb would visit Yellow Cab's office and receive cash that Richards took from the company safe. Sometimes during these meetings, Richards and Lipscomb would discuss taxicab issues then pending before the Council. The government alleged that in addition to making these monthly payments to Lipscomb, Richards gave Lipscomb free use of cars, free cellular telephone service, and free cab rides worth more than $3,300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Lipscomb ran again, his advisers heard Richards declare that he was willing to spend up to $30,000 to get Lipscomb elected. When Richards learned that corporations could not contribute to campaigns and that individuals could contribute no more than $1,000, however, he decided to \"lend\" $20,500 to a business owned by Lipscomb's daughter and son-in-law. That money was intended by all concerned to help fund Lipscomb's campaign, and it did so; but Lipscomb did not report the campaign \"loan\" or any of the payments in his campaign finance reports or his personal financial statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richards testified that although he never made the quid pro quo explicit, he expected that, in return for the monthly payments and the campaign funding, Lipscomb would cast votes favorable to Yellow Cab. Richards testified further that he and Lipscomb had an understanding, and that Richards was satisfied that Lipscomb knew that the payments would stop if he voted the wrong way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb's support of Yellow Cab went far beyond the casting of favorable votes at meetings of the Council. Over time, he and Richards discussed each of the taxicab issues on which Lipscomb allegedly was influenced by this bribery: (1) operating authority and fleet increases, (2) location of dispatch offices, (3) age limits and inspections, and (4) insurance ratings. Lipscomb had opposed Yellow Cab on these issues before 1994, but when he returned to the Council, he supported that company vigorously and often.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in 1994 Lipscomb, as a private citizen, had spoken out against authority for Yellow Cab and two other cab companies to operate in Dallas. Once he returned to the council, though, he supported Yellow Cab's requests for increases in the size of its cab fleets. Yet when cab companies unaffiliated with Richards sought authority to operate in Dallas, Lipscomb urged that their applications be removed from the council's agenda. When another cab company's request for operating authority was taken up by the council, Lipscomb tried to require a voice vote on the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yellow Cab also needed relief from a city ordinance requiring cab companies to maintain their dispatch offices inside the Dallas city limits. After a city staffer learned that Yellow Cab was violating this policy, she sought to enforce it, but the Council referred the matter to its Transportation Committee. Even though Lipscomb did not serve on that committee, he attended its meeting and browbeat the staffer, going so far as to ask her when she would retire. Eventually, with Lipscomb's encouragement, the Council permitted cab companies to operate dispatch offices in the Dallas suburbs, thus legitimating Yellow Cab's office, the only one in violation, in which Yellow Cab had invested $15,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Yellow Cab had the newest fleet among the cab companies serving Dallas, the City was encouraged by Yellow Cab energetically to enforce against its competitors the City's age limit on vehicles for hire and its requirement that they be inspected. In 1992, Lipscomb had favored relaxing both rules, but in 1996, after he was told by Richards that he wanted stricter enforcement, Lipscomb began to support age limits on sedan-style limousines similar to the limits that applied to taxicabs. He also sought to remove older shuttles and limousines from service more quickly, and he opposed the Council's effort to revisit its earlier vote &#8212; favorable to Yellow Cab &#8212; to approve stricter age limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb also acted on Yellow Cab's behalf with respect to insurance issues. Yellow Cab lobbied the Council to require that the insurance coverage mandated for taxis be written by insurers with favorable financial ratings. This proposal proved to be controversial: The City's Director of Human Services, whose department handled insurance matters, was concerned that a rating requirement might favor large firms and exclude small businesses owned by minorities or women. Lipscomb nevertheless sought to put the rating requirement on the Council's agenda, and both seconded and voted for a motion to increase the minimum rating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Lipscomb energetically used many of the tools at the disposal of a Council member &#8212; his vote, his oversight authority, his agenda-setting power, and his other parliamentary privileges &#8212; to support policies favorable to Yellow Cab, even though these policies conflicted with his previous positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Jurisdictional Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Lipscomb's second period of council service, the City, through many of its agencies and departments, received substantial federal funds. In the year ending in September 1996, Dallas received $44.3 million and spent $48.1 million in federal financial assistance which funded a wide range of joint priorities: community development, farmer's market infrastructure, emergency shelter, housing, community policing, airport and freeway improvements, arts development, pollution control, emergency management, interlibrary cooperation, child immunization, homeless health care, and substance abuse control, among others. Federal support in 1996 dwarfed state support, which totaled only $3.7 million received and $3.1 million spent. Other years were similar: in 1997, the city received $54.3 million and spent $53.3 million in federal funds, but received only $3.0 million and spent $3.8 million in state funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony of the city's chief financial officer showed that in Dallas's efforts to obtain and then allocate federal funds, the Council played an integral role:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And once the City gets the Department of Housing money or grant funds, does the City then disburse those funds?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, we do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And is the disbursement by approval of a City Councilmember or the City Council at large?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. If the individual expenditure is greater than $50,000, or $15,000 in the case of professional services, it would come back to the Council for approval of that specific contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And does that frequently happen?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, uh-huh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. All right. And, in fact, does the Council have to approve, vote for and approve the application to HUD and the other agencies of the federal government to get federal money?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes. They vote for the application and the acceptance of the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council as a whole thus controlled &#8212; and individual council members influenced &#8212; the City's applications for, and receipt and expenditure of, at least forty million federal dollars each year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government secured a lengthy indictment against Lipscomb. Counts 2 through 33 charged him with specific substantive bribery violations of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) and charged Richards with aiding and abetting those offenses. Conversely, counts 34 through 65 charged Richards with bribery violations of &#167; 666(a)(2) and charged Lipscomb with aiding and abetting. Count 1 charged Lipscomb with conspiring to violate &#167; 666. Notably, the government did not charge Lipscomb with the misuse of state or federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks before the long-scheduled trial date, the district court, acting <i>sua sponte,</i> without giving notice to the parties or holding a hearing, and over Lipscomb's strenuous objections, transferred the trial from the Dallas Division of the Northern District of Texas to the Amarillo Division. Thereafter, Richards entered into a plea agreement which, among other things, required him to testify at trial. The jury convicted Lipscomb on all counts. The district court sentenced him to 41 months' imprisonment, imposed a $7,500 fine, and ordered him to pay a $6,500 special assessment. The court also directed that the sentence be served under home confinement because of Lipscomb's failing health and advanced age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb appeals his conviction on several grounds. The government cross-appeals the home-confinement aspect of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Lipscomb's Challenge to the Jurisdictional Reach of &#167; 666</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it stood at the time and now stands, &#167; 666 contains two monetary thresholds. Section 666 reads, in principal part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>&#167; 666. Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving Federal funds</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section exists &#8212; (1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving <i>anything of value of $5,000 or more;</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of this section is that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits <i>in excess of $10,000</i> under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb insists that we should narrowly construe &#167; 666 to avoid the constitutional question that arises if we interpret the statute to prohibit activity not directly related to federal spending or federally funded programs. He proposes that we construe the statute to require a nexus between his offense conduct and federal funds &#8212; or, put differently, that his conduct implicate a tangible federal interest. He also contends that, when so construed, the statute does not reach his conduct. Neither contention succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phylogeny of &#167; 666 jurisprudence does reflect a growing tension between two possible focuses of the statute. One, which another court has dubbed the \"funds focus,\" would concentrate on deterring direct depletion of federal funds; the other, the so-called \"corruption focus,\" would combat \"the corrupting, public-trust eroding effects of bribery\" and would not require that federal funds be depleted or misallocated as a direct result of the bribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Lipscomb's proposal that we adopt the narrower, funds focus, however, would require us to ignore our consistently broad interpretation of &#167; 666 as targeting corruption <i>qua</i> corruption. Furthermore, even if we were to read &#167; 666 and our cases to construe it narrowly, to superimpose a nexus element, we would still conclude that there is a sufficient linkage between Lipscomb's conduct and federal funds to support jurisdiction of Lipscomb's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Westmoreland <i>and Its Progeny: The Corruption Focus &#8212; No Further Nexus Required</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first interpreted &#167; 666 in <i>United States v. Westmoreland.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The defendant, Westmoreland, was a county supervisor who was convicted of accepting bribes and kickbacks in connection with the purchasing of supplies for the county's highway construction projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The county received slightly more than $200,000 in total federal revenue-sharing funds, of which roughly 15% was allocated to Westmoreland's district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Westmoreland contended that \"the federal revenue sharing funds received [by her district] ... were segregated and not expended for the types of purchases she made.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> She therefore argued that the bribery \"concerned only state monies and did not fall within the purview of the statute.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We rejected such a construction as contrary to the statute's text:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Westmoreland's protestations, we find the relevant statutory language plain and unambiguous. By the terms of section 666, when a local government agency receives an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a federal assistance program, its agents are governed by the statute, and an agent violates subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct \"in <i>any</i> transaction or matter or series of transactions or matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the affairs of\" the local government agency. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(b) (Supp. 1984) (emphasis added). Subsection (b) contains nothing to indicate that \"any transaction involving $5,000\" means \"any federally funded transaction involving $5,000\" or \"any transaction involving $5,000 of federal funds[.]\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Westmoreland also made the argument that Lipscomb makes here: \"[A]n expansive interpretation [of &#167; 666] ... extends federal power in a manner that, in many instances, the federal interest at stake does not warrant.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The <i>Westmoreland</i> panel responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Congress has spoken, however, we do not sit to judge the wisdom of its action. It is sufficient that Congress seeks to preserve the integrity of federal funds by assuring the integrity of the organizations or agencies that receive them.... [T]he direct involvement of federal funds in a transaction is not an essential element of bribery under section 666(b); the government need not prove that federal monies funded a corrupt transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Westmoreland</i> thus held that no connection was required between the federal funds allocated to the county and the supervisor's illegal conduct. Instead, the only requisite involvement of federal funds was the county's receipt of more than $10,000 per year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Westmoreland,</i> we have sometimes applied its broad reading of &#167; 666 unconditionally. For example, in <i>United States v. Moeller,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> the government appealed the dismissal of &#167; 666 counts against employees of the Texas Federal Inspection Service (\"TFIS\"), a cooperative venture of the agriculture departments of Texas and the United States, in which state workers were empowered to conduct federal inspections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Although we said that \"there must be some nexus between the <i>criminal conduct</i> and the <i>agency</i> receiving federal assistance,\" that nexus was purely textual: It was present when the Texas Department of Agriculture, a government agency for purposes of &#167; 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal funds, and the defendants, TFIS employees, were agents of that federally-funded agency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Thus <i>Moeller</i> cannot be read to have imposed the extratextual nexus that Lipscomb urges us to engraft on &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some uncertainty seeped into our &#167; 666 jurisprudence as a result of <i>United States v.

[The briber] was without question a prisoner held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of agreements with the Federal Government. The preferential treatment accorded to him was a <i>threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program.</i> Whatever might be said about &#167; 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in other cases, the application of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Salinas,</i> the Supreme Court has decided only one more &#167; 666 case: <i>Fischer v. United States,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> which also sent mixed messages. Echoing <i>Salinas,</i> the <i>Fischer</i> Court described &#167; 666 as \"expansive, both as to the conduct forbidden and the entities covered\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> and read the statute to reveal Congress's \"expansive, unambiguous <i>intent to ensure the integrity</i> of organizations participating in federal assistance programs\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> &#8212; clearly embracing the \"corruption focus.\" The Court therefore affirmed the conviction of a defendant who had defrauded a municipal hospital authority that participated in the federal Medicare program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> In so doing, however, the Court once again mentioned in passing a conceivable constitutional problem: To read the statutory term \"benefits\" too broadly, the Court cautioned, so as to mean \"[a]ny receipt of federal funds,\" could \"turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense, upsetting the proper federal balance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Justice Thomas, joined in dissent by Justice Scalia, likewise warned that \"[w]ithout a jurisdictional provision that would ensure that in <i>each</i> case the exercise of federal power is related to the federal interest in a federal program, &#167; 666 would criminalize routine acts of fraud or bribery\" and threaten principles of federalism.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Salinas</i> and <i>Fischer</i> did not unconditionally validate our view that once a local government accepts more than $10,000 per year from the federal government, no further federal interest is needed to justify prosecution under &#167; 666, neither did either of those cases condemn our broad approach. The <i>Salinas</i> Court merely observed in passing that, even if a federal interest were required, such an interest clearly existed in preventing federal prisoners from bribing local jail officials participating in a federal incarceration program. Similarly, the <i>Fischer</i> Court construed a term in &#167; 666 broadly, simply musing that federalism principles might somehow limit the statute's sweep. As either a statutory or constitutional matter, then, the Court might be seen as harboring inchoate qualms about whether, for &#167; 666 to apply, there might be some need for a direct interest in the funds involved in the prohibited conduct (or, alternatively, a need for either a nexus between the federal dollars and the offense conduct or an extra-textual jurisdictional element to &#167; 666). Lipscomb argues this inference forcefully, noting that <i>Salinas</i> left open the question whether &#167; 666 \"requires some other kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of federal funds.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> He urges us to overlook <i>Westmoreland</i> and answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, of course, we could not do even if we were so inclined. Mere ruminations in Supreme Court opinions do not empower a subsequent panel of our court to disregard, much less overrule, the holding of a prior panel. And, as we noted just last year, \"[w]e are not convinced that <i>Salinas</i> wrought a change upon our earlier precedents.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Because <i>Salinas</i> and <i>Fischer</i> went no further than to advert in <i>dicta</i> to the mere possibility that the argument now advanced by Lipscomb might someday be favored, we are bound to adhere to <i>Westmoreland</i>'s statutory holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, our post-<i>Salinas</i> decisions interpreting &#167; 666 must be read as adhering to this rule. Nevertheless, the cautionary words in <i>Salinas</i> and <i>Fischer,</i> combined with our prior opinions' silence on the constitutional question, divided the next panel of this court to interpret &#167; 666. The panel majority in <i>United States v. Phillips</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> reiterated <i>Moeller</i>'s requirement of a nexus between the misconduct and the agency (as distinct from a nexus between the misconduct and the federal funds themselves),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> but added some extra-textual teeth in holding that defendant Phillips, a tax assessor, was not an \"agent\" of Louisiana's St. Helena Parish, which received over $10,000 in federal funds, so as to be liable himself under &#167; 666 for putting on his payroll a political ally who then did no work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> The panel instead viewed Phillips as an agent of the Louisiana Tax Commission, which received no federal funds, and concluded that the statute did not reach his activity. Underlying this definitional question about \"agent,\" however, lurked the majority's concern that the defendant was too functionally distant from the flow of federal funds to the parish:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Salinas</i> that the funds in question need not be purely federal, nor must the conduct in question have a direct effect on federal funds. The statute possibly can reach misuse of virtually all funds of an agency that administers the federal program in question. It is a different matter altogether, however, to suggest that the statute can reach any government employee who misappropriates purely local funds, <i>without regard to how organizationally removed the employee is from the particular agency that administers the federal program.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that it is at least arguable, albeit tenuously, that this \"organizationally removed\" language conflicts with <i>Westmoreland</i> and <i>Moeller,</i> even though the <i>Phillips</i> majority purported to distinguish those two cases factually, and the <i>Phillips</i> panel may be perceived as having favored the \"funds focus\" for &#167; 666. To the extent that there is a conflict, however, the older case controls, as the <i>Phillips</i> dissenter correctly noted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only by interpreting \"agent\" narrowly was the <i>Phillips</i> majority able to avoid the constitutional question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> The <i>Phillips</i> dissent read our own precedents as rejecting any nexus requirement whatsoever and took issue with the panel majority's narrow definition of \"agent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> The dissent asserted that a \"specific nexus &#8212; between Phillips and the federal funds inside Parish coffers &#8212; is not required\" and furthermore that \"it is sufficient that the criminal conduct affect the agency receiving federal assistance: in essence, we have determined that there is an inherent federal interest in insuring that agencies receiving significant amounts of federal funding are not corrupt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> In a nutshell, this is precisely the \"corruption focus\" that we had firmly adopted in <i>Westmoreland,</i> a focus that has never been overruled either by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

These cases provide additional support for the proposition that &#167; 666 easily reaches Lipscomb's conduct. In <i>United States v. Reyes,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> we affirmed the &#167; 666 conviction of city council members who had been bribed to vote in favor of awarding a municipal construction project to a particular contractor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> The government noted that a federal loan would have supported the project had it gone forward, but we explicitly declined to rely on that fact, stating instead that federal support of the three city departments involved in the project &#8212; the finance, housing, and legal departments &#8212; justified prosecuting under &#167; 666:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying <i>Westmoreland</i> and <i>Moeller</i>..., we conclude that the connection between federal benefits and the charged conduct is sufficient to uphold Reyes's convictions under &#167; 666.... Like the county supervisor in <i>Westmoreland</i> and the senior agency officials in <i>Moeller,</i> here <i>the charged criminal conduct related to city council members, who, by voting up or down on bids, ultimately decide how federal money will be spent.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an analysis firmly supports Lipscomb's susceptibility to conviction under &#167; 666: In Dallas, federal money supports the City's transportation and human services departments &#8212; the very agencies of city government that Lipscomb sought corruptly to influence. <i>Reyes</i> reaffirms, as a statutory matter, that whatever nexus &#167; 666 requires &#8212; if any &#8212; is present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, we decided <i>United States v. Williams</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> without discussing any jurisdictional element or nexus requirement at all &#8212; despite the fact that if there had been a jurisdictional flaw, it would have been incumbent on the <i>Williams</i> panel to address that problem, even <i>sua sponte. Williams</i> involved facts virtually identical to those present in <i>Reyes,</i> in <i>Westmoreland,</i> and here. Williams, a former member of the Jackson, Mississippi City Council, was convicted under &#167; 666 of aiding and abetting the solicitation and acceptance of bribes &#8212; specifically, $150,000 in exchange for a re-vote on a cable television license contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> The <i>Williams</i> court did not describe any direct federal fiscal interest at stake in that re-vote. Such questions, however, may not have been briefed or argued in <i>Williams,</i> as the opinion in that case expressly rejected only other challenges &#8212; those grounded in equal protection, due process, and sufficiency and admissibility of the evidence &#8212; to Williams's conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> Taken in isolation, <i>Williams</i> has little if any precedential value on the nexus issue, one way or the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But of course <i>Williams</i> does not stand alone. It is merely the most recent in a series of our opinions &#8212; <i>Westmoreland, Moeller, Marmolejo, Reyes,</i> and <i>Williams</i> &#8212; that have consistently applied the broad \"corruption focus\" of &#167; 666. The <i>Phillips</i> panel did construe the term \"agent\" to avoid the constitutional question, but we cannot do that here: As a textual matter, the term \"agent\" plainly includes city council members. <i>Westmoreland</i> applied &#167; 666 to a county supervisor; <i>Reyes</i> and <i>Williams</i> both applied it to city council members. Hence <i>Westmoreland</i>'s view of &#167; 666 continues to be the law in this circuit and to preclude a more narrow construction of the statute. Even though we get to the question from different jurisdictional perspectives, Judge Duh&#233; and I are in complete accord on the result for Lipscomb of the foregoing analysis of &#167; 666: He was subject to being tried in federal district court for violating that statute, and he was subject to being convicted by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>IV. DID LIPSCOMB RAISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the constitutional problem that Lipscomb's statutory-construction argument presages (and writing for myself alone, although supplementing Judge Smith's analysis), I must make three observations on our intrapanel disagreement over whether the constitutional issue is properly before us. To me, this debate: (1) is more semantical than substantive, (2) is in tension with controlling Supreme Court precedent, and (3) overlooks the real nature of the constitutional question at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Semantics first: As the Supreme Court recently said, \"jurisdiction ... is a word of many, too many, meanings.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a> This imprecision is one source of our panel's split here. Judge Duh&#233; reads \"jurisdiction\" in the pleadings, briefs, and record to mean <i>adjudicative</i> jurisdiction only &#8212; the authority of federal courts to hear only those categories of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) authorized by Congress, between those categories of persons (personal jurisdiction) permitted by the Constitution. But in the context of the expressly constitutional arguments that Lipscomb sometimes makes, Judge Smith and I read his use of \"jurisdiction\" &#8212; at least on those occasions &#8212; to mean <i>legislative</i> jurisdiction, the \"authority\" of Congress \"to make its law applicable to particular persons or activities.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb also uses the ambiguous phrase \"federal jurisdiction,\" which could be either adjudicative or legislative. That ambiguity is not only terminological, but also conceptual. To state the obvious, legislative jurisdiction flows <i>from</i> the Constitution <i>to</i> the Congress and limits, in today's context, the subject matter and the classes of persons that Congress may regulate by statute. In contrast, adjudicative jurisdiction generally flows <i>from</i> Congress <i>to</i> the courts as grants of subject-matter jurisdiction, grants made by Congress in enacting laws pursuant to its power to constitute inferior federal courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> In the instant context, the judicial power extends constitutionally to cases arising under federal criminal laws. Consequently, a court's <i>adjudicative</i> jurisdiction to convict a defendant of a federal crime cannot exist in the absence of Congress's <i>legislative</i> jurisdiction to criminalize the particular conduct of which the particular defendant is accused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reach of Congress's legislative jurisdiction, of course, is sometimes bounded by structural constitutional provisions. For example, grants of jurisdiction are limited by the Necessary and Proper Clause, which covers laws that \"carry into Execution ... all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States or in any Department or Officer thereof.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> I cannot even imagine how it could be \"necessary and proper\" to the exercise of either the judicial power or the power to constitute inferior courts for us to have <i>adjudicative</i> jurisdiction over a case implicating a statute that Congress lacked the <i>legislative</i> jurisdiction to enact. It should go without saying, therefore, that our subject-matter jurisdiction has constitutional as well as statutory limits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a>: It involves \"the courts' statutory <i>or constitutional</i> power to adjudicate the case.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To repeat, then: A federal forum simply must lack adjudicative jurisdiction to hear a case based on a federal statute that Congress lacked the legislative jurisdiction (translation: constitutional power or authority) to apply to the situation in question. If I am correct in my position that this case implicates our constitutional duty, at every level and at every stage of the proceedings, to ensure the existence of our adjudicative jurisdiction, then that duty trumps the canon of constitutional avoidance that Justice Brandeis discussed in <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a> a canon that on other occasions I have dutifully obeyed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> At the risk of exposing my own intellectual shortcomings, then, I confess that neither semantically nor substantively can I understand the distinction, which Judge Duh&#233; detects in Lipscomb's pleadings and briefs, between adjudicative, subject-matter jurisdiction and legislative jurisdiction (<i>structural</i> constitutionality)&#8212;a distinction that is clear to Judge Duh&#233; but in this case remains blurred to me. If a successful as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of &#167; 666 would limit Congress's legislative jurisdiction, i.e., would identify someone or some act beyond Congress's authority, it cannot help but limit our adjudicative jurisdiction to the same degree. In this sense, because Lipscomb appears to raise a structural jurisdictional challenge, I question whether his is the kind of constitutional argument that may be waived through delay or disuse; if it \"involves a court's power to hear a case, [it] can never be forfeited or waived.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I read them, Lipscomb's pleadings and briefs do raise &#8212; and thus do not waive &#8212; the constitutional issue. Rather, they question both Congress's legislative jurisdiction (constitutional authority) to enact &#167; 666 and our adjudicative power to apply &#167; 666 here. Lipscomb has raised a classic challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction: He \"argues that the extension of federal jurisdiction over acts such as [his] would exceed the power of Congress.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My belief that we should consider this argument finds support in <i>Salinas</i> itself. There the Supreme Court easily undertook to determine whether &#167; 666 was constitutional, and squarely held that it was, as applied,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> despite the fact that neither we nor the district court had addressed the statute's constitutionality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a> In support of its \"holding,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a> the Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[s]tatutes should be construed to avoid constitutional questions, but this interpretative canon is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature. Any other conclusion, while purporting to be an exercise in judicial restraint, would trench upon the legislative powers vested in Congress....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles apply to the rules of statutory construction we have followed to give proper respect to the federal-state balance....

Starting with these two premises, I cannot avoid the conclusion that Lipscomb did raise the constitutional flaw. By construing the statute as all three of us do, we are sailing into the very waters that Lipscomb warned us were constitutionally uncharted.

Even if &#167; 666 is not a conditional-grant statute &#8212; a conclusion of which I am less certain than is Judge Smith &#8212; the conditional-grant cases establish both that \"internal limits on congressional spending power are difficult to discern\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> and that, to whatever extent the Tenth Amendment is an external limit on the spending power, that Amendment does <i>not</i> function as \"a prohibition on the indirect achievement of objectives which Congress is not empowered to achieve directly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> The Tenth Amendment thus is not as great an obstacle to the necessity and propriety of &#167; 666 as Judge Smith believes it to be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Conditional-Grant Precedents</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress likely enacted &#167; 666 pursuant to the Spending Clause of the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a> Under that clause, it is settled, Congress may regulate the states by conditioning grants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> Cases on such conditions have established that the structural limits on federal power that often arise in the commerce-clause context do not operate with the same force against conditional-grant provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Dole,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn78\" id=\"fn78_ref\">78</a> which involved a statute conditioning a small portion of each state's federal highway aid on the state's establishing a minimum drinking age.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn79\" id=\"fn79_ref\">79</a> The Court upheld the drinking-age requirement as an exercise of Congress's Spending-Clause authority to condition federal grants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn80\" id=\"fn80_ref\">80</a> The Court also announced that when Congress chooses to go beyond its enumerated powers, and to use its spending power \"to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal monies upon compliance with federal statutory ... directives,\" the statutory condition must itself meet four conditions, the failure to meet any one of which might render a statute unconstitutionally broad.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn81\" id=\"fn81_ref\">81</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The</i> Dole <i>Test Is Instructive Here</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given <i>Dole</i>'s context, applying its test to &#167; 666 could be trebly problematic. First, like Judge Smith, two district courts have concluded that &#167; 666 is not a conditional-grant statute at all, because it does not require the state (here, Texas) or its political subdivision (here, Dallas) to do anything.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn82\" id=\"fn82_ref\">82</a> As the court in <i>United States v. Cantor</i> noted, &#167; 666 \"does not impose a condition on the receipt of federal funds. The statute neither requires a state's compliance with federal ... directives nor prevents state action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn83\" id=\"fn83_ref\">83</a> Like the <i>Cantor</i> court, however, I believe that this lack of direct effect on states and localities actually supports the statute's constitutionality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn84\" id=\"fn84_ref\">84</a> Furthermore, the Supreme Court has not held that, for a statute to be a conditional-grant provision and stand or fall under a <i>Dole</i> analysis, the statute must require states or localities either to take or to refrain from taking any action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn85\" id=\"fn85_ref\">85</a> <i>Dole</i> may describe Congress's spending power generally, not just its power to condition grants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, &#167; 666 is a freestanding ban: It neither grants any funds nor takes part in a broader funding statute. This fact has prompted the objection that its criminal sanction cannot be a condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn86\" id=\"fn86_ref\">86</a> Although superficially appealing, this argument elevates form too highly over substance. The anticorruption principle in &#167; 666 applies equally to every federal dollar granted, and &#167; 666 logically cuts across all federal grants to states and localities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn87\" id=\"fn87_ref\">87</a> To require Congress to insert a mini-&#167; 666 into every chapter of the United States Code that authorizes intergovernmental financial assistance would constitute excessive scrupulosity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, several judges have objected that Congress's spending power cannot include the power to criminalize conduct by third parties, and that <i>Dole</i> therefore cannot apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn88\" id=\"fn88_ref\">88</a> (This argument begs the broader question, which I address below, whether &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to the spending power.) Many courts, including this one in <i>Phillips,</i> have nevertheless interpreted &#167; 666 using <i>Dole</i>'s factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn89\" id=\"fn89_ref\">89</a> Therefore, although we may debate whether the &#167; 666 peg fits the conditional-grant hole, I shall test it under the four prongs of <i>Dole.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The</i> Dole <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dole</i> first requires that \"exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of the general welfare.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn90\" id=\"fn90_ref\">90</a> In assessing whether this is so, <i>Dole</i> cautions, \"courts should defer substantially to the judgment of Congress.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn91\" id=\"fn91_ref\">91</a> Congress has stated that the purpose of &#167; 666 is to \"protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn92\" id=\"fn92_ref\">92</a> Mindful of the deference due this judgment, I accept that Congress easily could have thought that &#167; 666 advanced the general welfare by protecting the federal fisc and by ensuring that state and local decisions regarding federal programs are not made by corrupt officials. I do not doubt, then, that Congress enacted &#167; 666 \"in pursuit of the general welfare.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Dole</i> warns that \"if Congress desires to condition the States' receipt of federal funds, it must do so unambiguously..., enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn93\" id=\"fn93_ref\">93</a> Even though &#167; 666 does not require the states to act, it does make state and local government officers criminally liable for specific misdeeds. Thus the states arguably have a dignity interest at stake, and if so, they have a right to know the threat to that interest that &#167; 666 would pose &#8212; and the language of &#167; 666, which is anything but ambiguous, surely lets them know. To the extent that &#167; 666 is a conditional-grant statute, both the grant (of $10,000 or more in federal funds) and the condition (criminalizing official bribery and theft) are pellucid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn94\" id=\"fn94_ref\">94</a> I see little danger that a state or locality that receives federal funds could mistake the potential of &#167; 666 to criminalize conduct by its officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Dole</i> mandates that conditions on federal spending be related \"to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn95\" id=\"fn95_ref\">95</a> or that conditions \"bear some relationship to the federal spending.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn96\" id=\"fn96_ref\">96</a> \"The required degree of this relationship is one of reasonableness or minimum rationality.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn97\" id=\"fn97_ref\">97</a> It suffices here to observe that many courts have held that &#167; 666 is reasonably related to the federal interest in safeguarding federal dollars from control of dishonest administrators, and that &#167; 666 therefore passes spending-power muster. At least one court has so concluded when the offense conduct did not involve federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn98\" id=\"fn98_ref\">98</a> Some of the other decisions arriving at this conclusion, however, may have dismissed facial, rather than as-applied, challenges to the statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn99\" id=\"fn99_ref\">99</a>; and other cases have affirmed convictions for conduct that implicated federal funds more directly than did Lipscomb's actions here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn100\" id=\"fn100_ref\">100</a> Because <i>Dole</i>'s relatedness inquiry merges with my analysis of whether applying &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to the spending power, I discuss both questions together in detail below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, in <i>Dole</i>'s final prong, the Court cautioned that \"other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fn101_ref\">101</a> Yet the Court then reiterated its <i>Oklahoma</i> holding that \"<i>a perceived Tenth Amendment limitation on congressional regulation of state affairs did not concomitantly limit the range of conditions legitimately placed on federal grants.</i>\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn102\" id=\"fn102_ref\">102</a> Rather, the \"independent bar\" simply means that Congress may not use its spending power \"to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn103\" id=\"fn103_ref\">103</a> In this case, no action by Texas or Dallas is alleged to be unconstitutional, so the fourth <i>Dole</i> prong is plainly not at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, to the extent that <i>Dole</i> controls whether &#167; 666 can apply here, the only problem lies in the third part of the <i>Dole</i> test: reasonable relationship to a federal interest. Because this reasonably-related prong of <i>Dole</i> is a specific application of the more general test for whether an act of Congress is necessary and proper to an enumerated power,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn104\" id=\"fn104_ref\">104</a> I treat these questions together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">AS-APPLIED CONSTITUTIONALITY UNDER <i>McCULLOCH</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to assigning Congress the spending power, which brings with it the power to condition grants, the Constitution also gives Congress the power \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be <i>necessary and proper</i> for carrying into Execution\" the powers expressly delegated to the federal government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn105\" id=\"fn105_ref\">105</a> Prosecuting Lipscomb under &#167; 666 is therefore constitutional if &#167; 666 is \"necessary and proper\" to Congress's spending power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

To the <i>McCulloch</i> Court, this example demonstrated that \"necessary\" has a range of meanings, including \"needful, requisite, essential, or conducive to.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn111\" id=\"fn111_ref\">111</a> It was through the lens of this broad construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause that Marshall saw justification for Congress's creation of the national bank, the power to create which is nowhere enumerated in Article I. Whether that broad construction justifies applying &#167; 666 here depends on Congress's intent in enacting the statute, as well as on the nature of the federal interest embodied in this case and the relationship between that interest and Lipscomb's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Legislative History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">History often tells us why Congress deemed a statute necessary and proper. Not so for &#167; 666, however, because it was enacted as part of an omnibus spending bill of the type that makes the search for legislative history Sisyphean. What history exists is multilayered, sparse, equivocal, and even mysterious. By no means, I respectfully submit, is it capable of supporting Judge Smith's contention that \"Congress did not find it necessary that &#167; 666 be applied in cases not involving federal funds or programs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn112\" id=\"fn112_ref\">112</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The 1986 Technical Amendment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We owe the current language of &#167; 666 to the Criminal Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn113\" id=\"fn113_ref\">113</a> As that Act's title suggests, and as we recognized in <i>Westmoreland,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn114\" id=\"fn114_ref\">114</a> Congress did not intend the Act to change &#167; 666 substantively in ways that would affect our reading of it here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn115\" id=\"fn115_ref\">115</a> This is important, because the 1986 amendment rewrote language that reveals how Congress would have answered our constitutional question in 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The 1984 Enactment</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As first enacted, &#167; 666(b) read:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, being an agent of an organization, or of a State or local government agency ...

As eventually enacted, &#167; 666 was a small part of a large crime bill which was engrafted on a huge omnibus spending bill that funded many departments and agencies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn117\" id=\"fn117_ref\">117</a> None of this bill's reports, written as they were by the Appropriations Committees, gives context for &#167; 666, a criminal statute which, of course, appropriated no funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn118\" id=\"fn118_ref\">118</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 666 as enacted was identical to a provision in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which passed the Senate but never made it out of the House Judiciary Committee on its own and evidently had to piggyback on the omnibus spending bill to gain legislative momentum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn119\" id=\"fn119_ref\">119</a> The Senate report on the crime bill, printed in 1983, can be taken as an authoritative statement of the Senate Judiciary Committee's intent for what became &#167; 666. It is tenuous at best, however, to rely, as does Judge Smith, solely on one committee report &#8212; on a wholly separate bill &#8212; as stating the views of the entire Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The questionable probative weight of the Senate report aside, that report is still not determinative here, for the evidence goes both ways. The relevant passage is titled \"Part C &#8212; Program Fraud and Bribery,\" and states that &#167; 666</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">is designed to create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery <i>involving Federal monies</i> that are disbursed to private organizations or State and local governments <i>pursuant to a Federal program.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn120\" id=\"fn120_ref\">120</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report notes, however, that under the prior law banning theft of federal property, prosecuting was often impossible</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because title has passed to the recipient [government] before the property is stolen, or the funds are so commingled that the Federal character of the funds cannot be shown. This gives rise to a serious gap in the law, since even though title to the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such program funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn121\" id=\"fn121_ref\">121</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the report's emphasis on program funds would support a narrow reading of the necessity and propriety of &#167; 666, its emphasis on commingling supports a broad one. In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee's most explicit direction actually suggests that the Committee intended to limit the scope of &#167; 666, but in a way that still would cover Lipscomb-like conduct:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee intends that the term \"Federal program involving a grant, a contract, a subsidy, a loan, a guarantee, insurance, or another form of Federal assistance\" be construed broadly, consistent with the <i>purpose of this section to protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from</i> theft, fraud, and <i>undue influence by bribery.</i> However, the concept is not unlimited. The term \"Federal program\" means that there must exist a specific statutory scheme authorizing the Federal assistance in order to promote and achieve certain policy objectives. Thus, not every Federal contract or disbursement of funds would be covered. For example, if a government agency lawfully purchases more than $10,000 in equipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this section to make a theft of $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn122\" id=\"fn122_ref\">122</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus one of the two lines that the Senate Judiciary Committee expressly drew &#8212; to exclude theft from a supplier from the coverage of &#167; 666 &#8212; would not exclude Lipscomb's conduct, quintessentially \"undue influence by bribery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>The Specified Cases</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immediate next sentence in the report, subject to much exegesis by Judge Smith, states: \"It is, however, the intent [`of this section'] to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the types involved in the <i>Del Toro, Hinton,</i> and <i>Mosley</i> cases.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn123\" id=\"fn123_ref\">123</a> With continued due respect to Judge Smith, I do not discern in this sentence any clear direction to us. Both <i>Hinton</i> and <i>Mosley sustained</i> convictions of bribed local officials whom courts considered to be federal officials under the prior bribery statute because they exerted federal authority and controlled the disbursement of federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn124\" id=\"fn124_ref\">124</a> Simple logic dictates that just because the Committee intended &#167; 666 in part to codify these cases does not meant that it sought to <i>limit</i> &#167; 666 to these cases exclusively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Del Toro,</i> the federal interest was more attenuated. The defendants were convicted of bribing a New York City official to ensure that they would supply office space to a city program that was eligible for federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn125\" id=\"fn125_ref\">125</a> The <i>Del Toro</i> court reversed these bribery convictions, noting that even if the official had succeeded in provisionally securing the lease as desired, three local agencies would have had to approve the lease before the city could apply to the federal government for funds, so that \"[t]here were no existing committed federal funds for the purpose.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn126\" id=\"fn126_ref\">126</a> The Senate Committee's intent to overrule <i>Del Toro</i> thus reflects that the Committee thought it necessary and proper for &#167; 666 to reach bribery even before the federal government had committed funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn127\" id=\"fn127_ref\">127</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most that can be concluded from the report, then, is that the Senate Judiciary Committee delimited the scope of &#167; 666 in part by seeking to exclude theft from suppliers but to include bribery of officials running programs that <i>might</i> receive federal funds. I do not see the report as shedding much light on our question. Lipscomb's conduct falls into a middle ground that the report simply does not address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>The 1981 Bill</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plot thickens still further when an effort is made to verify the assertion in the 1983 report that the language of &#167; 666 was derived from a 1981 bill that never became law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn128\" id=\"fn128_ref\">128</a> The 1981 bill and its report emerged from Senate Judiciary &#8212; the same committee that later wrote the 1983 bill and report. The Committee omitted from both the 1983 bill and the 1984 act, however, the very language in the 1981 bill that would have answered our question: (c) Jurisdiction. &#8212; There is federal jurisdiction over an offense described in this section if &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) the public servant is an agent of a State or local government charged by a federal statute, or by a regulation issued pursuant thereto, with administering monies or property derived from a federal program, <i>and the official action or legal duty</i> [with respect to which the bribe is taken] <i>is related to the administration of such program.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn129\" id=\"fn129_ref\">129</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in 1983, the Senate Judiciary Committee had in hand&#8212;and even mentioned &#8212; a two-year-old bill that would have required a federal interest or nexus as a jurisdictional predicate. Yet the 1983 bill and 1984 enactment contained none of that language or anything similar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn130\" id=\"fn130_ref\">130</a> The reason for that absence is unclear. In 1981, when the Committee clearly sought to require a federal nexus, it had sufficient command of the English language to do so. To suppose that the Committee lost that faculty over either two or four years is ludicrous. Section 666 as enacted and amended, therefore, might have reflected a change in the Senate Judiciary Committee's view on whether to require a federal nexus, but we cannot say this with certainty: For all we know, the Committee might well have sought to exercise federal criminal jurisdiction up to its constitutional limits, leaving the issue to the courts to decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Views of Other Courts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the reason for &#167; 666's silence on this question, the courts have struggled to produce the answer. Some district courts have tested &#167; 666 against the Tenth Amendment, treating the statute as an emanation of the spending power, and have come to varying conclusions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn131\" id=\"fn131_ref\">131</a> Additionally, four of our fellow appellate courts have examined the sweep of &#167; 666, either as a statutory matter or a constitutional one, and are also divided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb relies on <i>United States v.

To pass muster under the Spending Clause, legislation regulating behavior of entities receiving federal funds must, among other things, be based upon a federal interest in the particular conduct. <i>See South Dakota v. Dole,</i> 483 U.S. 203, 207, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). Applying &#167; 666 to offense conduct, absent evidence of any federal interest, would appear to be an unconstitutional exercise of power under the Spending Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn133\" id=\"fn133_ref\">133</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To avoid this supposed constitutional problem, the <i>Zwick</i> court believed that to read &#167; 666 literally is to err, and held that \"&#167; 666 requires that the government prove a federal interest is implicated by the defendant's offense conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn134\" id=\"fn134_ref\">134</a> Not to require a nexus, reasoned the Third Circuit, would erase significant federal-state boundaries by turning &#167; 666 into a general anti-corruption law, which, in the Third Circuit's view, Congress had not intended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn135\" id=\"fn135_ref\">135</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What then, under <i>Zwick,</i> would constitute a federal interest? \"The amount of federal funds\" alone, reasoned the <i>Zwick</i> court, could constitute the interest if the federal funds provided \"the greater part of a township's budget\"; if not, the offense conduct would have to implicate a substantive or programmatic interest, even though \"a highly attenuated implication of a federal interest will suffice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn136\" id=\"fn136_ref\">136</a> Since deciding <i>Zwick,</i> the Third Circuit has clarified that the federal interest can reach very deep into the ranks of local government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn137\" id=\"fn137_ref\">137</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In diametric opposition to the Third Circuit, two other circuits have declined to read an extra-textual nexus into &#167; 666. The Sixth Circuit has rejected a constitutional attack on its pre-<i>Salinas</i> position that except for the textual $10,000 threshold, &#167; 666 does not require a nexus between federal funds and the offense conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn138\" id=\"fn138_ref\">138</a> The Supreme Court recently declined to review this result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn139\" id=\"fn139_ref\">139</a> The Seventh Circuit likewise has held that the broad text of &#167; 666 controls: \"It is not our part to trim &#167; 666 by giving its text a crabbed reading.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn140\" id=\"fn140_ref\">140</a> Noting that the fungibility of money militates against a narrow reading of &#167; 666, the Seventh Circuit concluded as a statutory matter that the district court properly convicted a township supervisor, even though his bribe-taking related only to his control of the town's general-assistance program, which did not receive any federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn141\" id=\"fn141_ref\">141</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his reliance on <i>Zwick,</i> Lipscomb would rely on a precedent from the Second Circuit, but close inspection of that case reveals that it actually supports his conviction here. In <i>United States v. Santopietro,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn142\" id=\"fn142_ref\">142</a> that court stood by its earlier requirement of \"at least some connection between the bribe and a risk to the integrity of the federal [sic] funded program.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn143\" id=\"fn143_ref\">143</a> &#8212; obviously a \"corruption focus.\" Nevertheless, the example that the Second Circuit gave of bribery that &#167; 666 would <i>not</i> reach &#8212; a bribe paid to the hypothetical meat inspector of a city that received a federal grant only for its parks department &#8212; involves a federal interest that is much more attenuated from the perpetrator than does this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn144\" id=\"fn144_ref\">144</a> Furthermore, the <i>Santopietro</i> court <i>affirmed</i> the convictions of former officials of Waterbury, Connecticut, who had accepted bribes from real estate developers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn145\" id=\"fn145_ref\">145</a> Linkage between the officials' offense conduct and federal funds was actually more remote than the connection in the instant case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]orrupt payments were made by real estate developers to secure the use of the appellants' influence with city agencies including the City Plan Commission, the Zoning Commission, the Water Department, and the Fire Marshal, and the use of their influence to further the interests of the developers in the appointments of members and chairpersons of land use boards and relevant committees and agencies in the City of Waterbury. During the relevant periods, substantial federal funds were received by Waterbury for housing, urban development, and other programs within the purview of these agencies and officials. <i>Since federal funds were received by Waterbury for housing and urban development programs and the corrupt payments concerned real estate transactions within the purview of the agencies administering federal funds, the requisite connection between the bribes and the integrity of federally funded programs is satisfied.</i> Thus, this is not a case where the transactions sought to be influenced concerned one department of a city and the requisite $10,000 of federal funds were received by a totally unrelated department.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn146\" id=\"fn146_ref\">146</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Santopietro</i> thus stands indisputably for a <i>purview</i> test: To be prosecuted under &#167; 666, a bribed official must at least influence other officials who have within their purview federally funded programs, but the corruption need not touch those programs. In other words, <i>Santopietro</i> asks whether a defendant <i>could have</i> influenced the use of federal funds by controlling the <i>same</i> agencies or staffers whom he actually corruptly influenced with respect to purely local matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a purview test, applied to the case at bar, supports convicting Lipscomb, who took bribes in return for influencing matters within the purviews of two Dallas departments, human services and transportation, which both received federal funds. The connection between federal funds and corrupt conduct is closer here than in <i>Santopietro,</i> where the court did not explain how the \"City Plan Commission, the Zoning Commission, the Water Department, and the Fire Marshal\" administered federal funds, but rather suggested that these agencies and officials made decisions &#8212; presumably determining whether proposed developments complied with zoning, fire, and other codes<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn147\" id=\"fn147_ref\">147</a> &#8212; with respect to housing and urban development programs, likely administered by other agencies, that did receive federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn148\" id=\"fn148_ref\">148</a> In other words, the federal interest in <i>Santopietro</i> was more remote than it is here, as Lipscomb himself cast votes to approve requests for federal funds, and himself both lobbied and pressured officials who ran federally-funded programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A less cumbersome and more direct purview rule would apply &#167; 666 to defendants who themselves influence or control federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn149\" id=\"fn149_ref\">149</a> Such a rule also would support convicting Lipscomb here. The <i>Santopietro</i> court, however, did not affirmatively adopt this rule, explicitly leaving open the question whether the former mayor could be prosecuted under &#167; 666 for <i>any</i> transaction involving the city if the federal funds were entirely unrelated to that transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn150\" id=\"fn150_ref\">150</a> <i>Santopietro,</i> therefore, although confirming a nexus rule, also could be read as supporting Lipscomb's conviction under such a rule or (just possibly) as skirting the relevant question entirely. Thus, of the two cases from other circuits &#8212; <i>Zwick</i> and <i>Santopietro</i> &#8212; that Lipscomb relies on heavily, only <i>Zwick</i> could support finding &#167; 666 unconstitutional as applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Federal Interests at Stake</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My own review is guided by the traditional, rational-relationship test for whether a statute is necessary and proper to an enumerated federal power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn151\" id=\"fn151_ref\">151</a> In this case, two federal interests support the view that Congress reasonably could have thought it necessary and proper to apply &#167; 666 to agents and officials like Lipscomb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Absolute Amount of Federal Dollars</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the <i>total</i> federal funding received by Dallas &#8212; $56 million in 1998 &#8212; justified federal jurisdiction over Lipscomb's conduct. Lipscomb focuses on the fact that $56 million was only 3.5% of Dallas's city budget in that year. In part, this is a dispute over the meaning of one passage in <i>Zwick:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can conceive of several ways in which the government could prove a federal interest in a &#167; 666 [case].... The amount of federal funds could provide the requisite federal implication, even if the purpose of those funds has no explicit relationship to the subject of the bribe. If, for example, in a given year, the greater part of a township's budget came from federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate federal interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn152\" id=\"fn152_ref\">152</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the abstract, this \"greater part\" yardstick may have an appealing ring, but it is utterly divorced from reality. In actuality, no state government and, I suspect, only a rare county or city government (not even the District of Columbia), is so wholly a creature of the United States as to rely on Washington for \"the greater part\" of its revenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn153\" id=\"fn153_ref\">153</a> In the rare case that federal funding is a majority of total revenue, federal power to criminalize local corruption would undoubtedly exist; but surely the <i>absolute</i> level of federal grants, as well as their <i>relative</i> importance to the city's budget, would provide a federal interest, to the protection of which &#167; 666 is necessary and proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether this is so &#8212; to judge if &#167; 666 is indeed reasonably related to the federal interest in safeguarding $56 million &#8212; I would analogize the federal government and Dallas to partners in spending federal dollars to advance shared goals. In the private sector, what would a reasonable funding partner who has advanced $56 million do after learning that its service partner takes kickbacks, albeit regarding matters not within the partnership's scope? The funding partner might well dissolve the partnership rather than wait for the service partner's corruption to widen and infect partnership dealings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The partnership analogy does not bear close inspection, but its failure, instead of undermining the constitutionality of &#167; 666, actually supports it. The analogy founders on the fact that in the public sector, states, counties, and municipalities hold monopolies on delivering many governmental services to their citizens. Thus, when Congress seeks to benefit the citizenry of a particular state and locality, it can turn to very few potential public partners. This scarcity suggests that if the federal-Dallas partnership were dissolved when corruption among Dallas officials is discovered &#8212; or if the federal government were to withhold funds in such a case &#8212; the purpose of the federally funded programs would be defeated, and Congress would be prevented from using the spending power to promote the welfare of citizens of Dallas. The populace of Dallas, however, is by definition innocent of official corruption, and should not suffer a cut in federally funded services on account of it. The prospective specter of criminal sanctions against corrupt officials themselves, rather than post-hoc, fiscally punitive measures against Dallas, is therefore a logical and appropriate solution for local corruption that threatens &#8212; even indirectly, as here &#8212; $56 million in federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council votes to apply for federal funds, to accept federal funds, and to approve all large contracts, including those involving federal funds. Congress could rationally believe that the integrity of $56 million of federal funds applied for by the Council &#8212; particularly when the federal treasury is funding not just one or two projects but many &#8212; suffices as a federal interest weighty enough to justify federal criminal jurisdiction over Council members who are bribed with respect to local issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Integrity of State and Local Officials with Authority over Federal Funds</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second federal interest at stake here is the integrity <i>vel non</i> of federal programs and funds, regardless of the quantum or budget percentage of funds at issue. A corrupt state or city official who has real responsibility for, or often participates in, the allocation of federal funds is a \"threat to the integrity\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn154\" id=\"fn154_ref\">154</a> of those funds, even if they are not actually or directly infected by his corruption. Congress may legitimately view as necessary and proper the imposition of federal criminal liability for bribery, so as to ensure the honesty of state and local officials who have federal funds in their purview or federal programs under their authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Smith advances two explicit arguments against such liability (neither of which, with respect, I find persuasive) and one implicit argument that is defeated by the text of the statute and the facts of this case. The implicit contention is that bribery of Lipscomb alone, apart from any of his fourteen council colleagues, cannot create a sufficient federal interest or nexus, because Lipscomb cannot act for the Council. This argument might also be grounded in the fact that, alone, one legislator does not administer program funds. The text of &#167; 666 disposes of this argument, as a statutory matter, because Congress clearly sought to apply &#167; 666 to legislative-branch officials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn155\" id=\"fn155_ref\">155</a> As a constitutional matter, there is little or no basis for holding that federal jurisdiction over bribery of Council members depends on whether the briber can command a majority. One Council member's vote, after all, can tip the balance on a close question; and, as Lipscomb's conduct here demonstrates, a member has a number of arrows in his parliamentary quiver besides the final vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Smith also speculates that the State of Texas would have prosecuted Lipscomb had it known of the evidence against him. This is not a constitutional argument; it merely begs the constitutional question regarding the limits of the spending power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn156\" id=\"fn156_ref\">156</a> And, as either a positive or a normative statement &#8212; that the federal government either does or should leave such prosecutions to the states &#8212; it fails. There are at least three reasons why federal rather than state bribery prosecutions might be necessary and proper in cases like Lipscomb's. First, the federal government might have a greater incentive to prosecute than does the state government, either because the offense conduct directly or potentially affects federal funds or because the federal government provides more money to the locality than does the state government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn157\" id=\"fn157_ref\">157</a> The latter proposition is true in this case: In terms of dollars provided to Dallas, the federal government has a stake in the city's fiscal integrity that is between fifteen and twenty times greater than the state's stake.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn158\" id=\"fn158_ref\">158</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, federal officials might be less corruptible than state and local officials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn159\" id=\"fn159_ref\">159</a> and an informant with evidence of misconduct by a state or local official might feel safer in taking his information to federal authorities; indeed, he could even prefer that it not be shared with state or local authorities. Third, federal prosecutors are less likely to be linked to state and local politicians and are generally more independent of local political forces that might try to protect high officials from aggressive state enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Smith's second contention against high-official liability is a law-and-economics argument that, in my opinion, does not hold water and affords courts little basis, if any, on which to pronounce a statute unconstitutional, whether facially or as applied. As I understand his argument, it is that if courts permit the United States as well as states to prosecute high local officials for bribery involving <i>local</i> funds and programs, corrupt officials will change their behavior and, on the margin, take more bribes directly related to <i>federal</i> funds and programs than they otherwise would.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn160\" id=\"fn160_ref\">160</a> With respect, I perceive at least three flaws of logic in this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, social science has not yet proven that the rational-actor model adequately explains the real-world behavior of white-collar criminals: As behavioral law and economics warns us, inadequate information, biases, and heuristics often prevent individuals from acting rationally. For example, unless a local official is well integrated into a culture of white-collar criminality (which would itself suggest that federal prosecution may be necessary), he will lack even anecdotal data on the probability that either the state or the federal government will detect and prosecute bribery. (Anecdotal data would, of course, be the only data available.) Therefore, an official considering whether to take a bribe would not be likely to calculate the odds of detection or prosecution in the dispassionately mathematical way that the rational-actor model might suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, standard law-and-economics analysis actually justifies federal criminal jurisdiction on the basis of interstate externalities, an argument eminently applicable here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn161\" id=\"fn161_ref\">161</a> If bribery in Dallas threatens federally-provided funds, that corruption threatens the federal Treasury, which is funded by taxes collected not just from Texas but from all across the Nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly and most importantly, even if Judge Smith's law-and-economics objection to federal jurisdiction here were an accurate predictor, it has little force. The most that his prediction might prove is that Congress has deluded itself into passing a law that may be self-defeating, because it increases the vulnerability of federal funds to corruption and thus disregards economic facts. \"But a law can be both economic folly and constitutional.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn162\" id=\"fn162_ref\">162</a> A means-ends tradeoff, weighing costs against benefits, is precisely the sort of political judgment that members of Congress are entitled &#8212; and better equipped than judges &#8212; to make, and that courts should generally defer to. As judges, we do not experience the perils attendant on taxing one's own constituents, do not enjoy the political significance of bringing home the fiscal bacon, and do not share the frustration of seeing hard-won federal dollars bleed off through the hands of corrupt local officials. Lacking the power to tax and spend, federal judges should defer to a plausible risk-reward construct that Congress has enacted to protect the federal fisc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Constitutional Limits to &#167; 666?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb strongly argues that if &#167; 666 constitutionally criminalizes conduct like his by state and local agents, then there are no limits to its sweep, and federal criminal law extends to briberies totally removed from federal funds. As I have analyzed Lipscomb's constitutional challenge to the statute as it applies to him, I need not determine here whether there is a constitutional limit on &#167; 666's reach. A brief comment is nonetheless in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a statutory matter, even <i>Westmoreland</i> &#8212; our broadest (and controlling) reading of &#167; 666 &#8212; did not address whether &#167; 666 can reach the lowest levels of state and local bureaucracies. <i>Westmoreland</i> did, however, advert to the limits in the statute's text:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he statute does not encompass every local bribery as Westmoreland suggests. Although the extent of the federal government's assistance programs will bring many organizations and agencies within the statute's scope, the statute limits its reach to entities that receive a substantial amount of federal funds and to agents who have the authority to effect significant transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn163\" id=\"fn163_ref\">163</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a constitutional matter, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, the test is whether prosecution would be rationally related to a federal interest &#8212; that is, to effecting Congress's spending power. In this case, two already-noted federal interests justify applying &#167; 666 to Lipscomb's conduct: (1) the total amount of federal funds extended to Dallas and (2) Lipscomb's purview &#8212; his high rank and his broad influence over many programs that receive federal funds. Of these two interests, his purview would easily accommodate, in another case, the Second Circuit's hypothetical implication in <i>Santopietro</i> that it could not be necessary and proper to the spending power for federal criminal liability to extend to a corrupt city meat inspector when the city receives federal funds only for its parks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn164\" id=\"fn164_ref\">164</a> That case is not before us today, however, so I need not predict, in double <i>dicta,</i> whether there might be categories of prosecutions under &#167; 666 that are not necessary and proper to the spending power. For today's purposes it is sufficient to note that if there are such categories, Lipscomb is far removed from them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional argument in this case boils down to how <i>direct</i> must local corruption's threat to federal funds be for &#167; 666 to apply. Lipscomb insists that, although federal funds need not be directly involved in the offense conduct, the state or local official's conduct still must threaten the integrity of federal funds more directly than did his. Not so. The foregoing analysis has shown that (1) the text of &#167; 666 reads otherwise; (2) the legislative history does not clearly contradict it (as it must to override a clear criminal statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn165\" id=\"fn165_ref\">165</a>); and (3) our controlling precedents on point reject such a limit. Reduced to the bare essentials, application of &#167; 666 to Lipscomb's conduct is indeed <i>reasonably related</i> to a <i>federal interest,</i> and thus is <i>necessary and proper</i> to Congress's exercise of its <i>spending power.</i> Congress could have believed, quite legitimately, that preventing federal funds from passing through state and local legislative bodies whose members are corrupt, and to do so with the deterrent of criminalizing the legislators' corruption, even with respect to purely state or local issues, was necessary and proper to the federal spending power. As courts can require of Congress nothing more than such a rational relationship to the spending power, &#167; 666 is constitutional as applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. VENUE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established that the federal courts have jurisdiction of this case, we turn to Lipscomb's assignments of reversible error by the district court. Chief among these is his contention that the court abused its discretion in transferring the trial from Dallas to Amarillo <i>sua sponte,</i> shortly before trial, and over Lipscomb's objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Transfer Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court read its unexpected transfer order into the record at the end of a hearing on December 20, 1999. The order reads, nearly in its entirety:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As everyone knows this case will involve the trial of one of the best[-]known sitting elected officials in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex for allegations of public corruption. This Court cannot recall such a trial of a sitting elected official in Dallas for allegations of public corruption. This case has already received significant media attention and undoubtedly will receive more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court notes that both sides have requested or not opposed requests for individual voir dire examination of the prospective jury panel and both sides have requested use of a jury questionnaire. Both motions, unusual and rare motions in federal criminal cases in Dallas, are made precisely because of the high profile of Defendant Lipscomb, a Dallas City Councilman of twelve years['] experience and one of the most influential and well[-]known political leaders in the Dallas African[-]American community for the last three decades. Councilman Lipscomb has been an effective representative of his constituency and locally has strong supporters and detractors. These facts will obviously make selection of a jury of twelve with no preconceived opinions about Al Lipscomb no easy task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated this case has thus far generated substantial publicity in the local media and will generate more throughout the trial. Such coverage has resulted in the Court reading in the newspapers certain information that has been filed under seal. The Court is also concerned about the ability to select a fair and impartial jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the various motions regarding jury selection that both sides have filed[,] the Court is not convinced that such measures would be sufficient to assure Councilman Lipscomb, the other defendants, and the Government a fair trial. It is this Court's fervent desire and absolute obligation to see to it that a fair trial is conducted &#8212; fair to both the defendants and the Government. This Court will do all in its power under the law to make sure the verdict in this case is based on the evidence presented in the courtroom, and absolutely nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no \"divisional\" venue in criminal cases under Federal Criminal Rule [sic] of Procedure 18. Since the 1966 amendment of this rule[,] providing for prosecution to be had in the district in which the offense was committed, a division of a federal judicial district is no longer a unit of venue in criminal cases. <i>United States v. Burns,</i> 662 F.2d 1378 (11th Cir., 1981); <i>Zicarelli v. Gray,</i> 543 F.2d 466 (3rd Cir., 1976). Within[-]district transfers of criminal cases are allowed under the law in this circuit. See <i>United States v. []Bridges,</i> 551 F.2d 651 (5th Cir.1977) and <i>United States v. James,</i> 528 F.2d 999 (5th Cir.1976), <i>cert. denied,</i> 429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 382, 50 L.Ed.2d 326, 429 U.S. 1055, 97 S.Ct. 770, 50 L.Ed.2d 772 (1977). Indeed, this Court disposed of <i>all</i> criminal cases filed in the Wichita Falls Division of the Northern District of Texas (about 100 cases) over a 4-&#189; year period (1994 to 1999) in the Dallas Division of the Northern District of Texas. The law is clear that in the Court's sound discretion, after considering the statutory elements, which this Court has done, this case may be tried anywhere within the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amarillo is a good[-]size[d] city[,] serviced by several airlines and is only a five[-]hour drive from Dallas. No defendant is indigent and all have retained, as opposed to appointed, council [sic]. The Court has made a careful analysis and given due consideration of the convenience of the witnesses and the parties, and considered the prompt administration of justice. These considerations, coupled with the concerns for selection of an impartial jury as expressed by the parties in their pretrial motions, as well as all the concerns the Court has expressed above, causes [sic] the Court to find that the prompt administration of justice would best be effectuated by having the trial of this case in the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court is absolutely convinced that the prompt administration of justice will best be served by conducting this trial in Amarillo, where it is unlikely [sic] that few, if any on the jury panel will have ever heard of Al Lipscomb or Floyd Richards, and fewer still, if any[,] will have any preconceived ideas or opinions about them. This will help assure that the jury verdict is based on the merits of the evidence presented in the courtroom, and nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the issuance of this order, no party had presented evidence regarding prejudice from pretrial publicity or regarding any other issue relative to venue. On hearing the order read, lawyers for Lipscomb and his co-defendant, Richards, objected. Lipscomb filed written objections nine days later &#8212; objections on which the court did not rule before the trial began, as long scheduled, on January 11, 2000, in Amarillo, some three hundred miles from Dallas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a motion for a new trial following his conviction, Lipscomb renewed his objections to the venue transfer, which motion the district court later denied. Also after trial, the government filed thirty-seven newspaper articles about Lipscomb's case that had appeared from March through December 19, 1999, as well as other articles that appeared after the transfer order &#8212; none of which had been in the record when the transfer order issued and none of which were so much as mentioned by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Standard of Review: Abuse of Discretion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review all questions concerning venue under the abuse of discretion standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn166\" id=\"fn166_ref\">166</a> In general, \"[a] district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn167\" id=\"fn167_ref\">167</a> A district court also abuses its discretion if it \"bases its decision ... on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn168\" id=\"fn168_ref\">168</a> As a leading treatise on standards of review suggests, a trial court abuses its discretion \"when the judge has considered the wrong factors in applying his discretion (the judgment call was made as to issues or factors not within the scope of his discretionary powers).\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn169\" id=\"fn169_ref\">169</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversal of an intradistrict transfer is proper only if a party demonstrates a \"substantial ground for overturning the district court's decision.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn170\" id=\"fn170_ref\">170</a> In the typical case, the defendant appeals the trial court's <i>denial</i> of a Rule 18 motion to transfer venue.

Rule 21 governs transfers to another district and provides that this may be done only on motion of the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn177\" id=\"fn177_ref\">177</a> Rule 18, in contrast, governs intradistrict transfers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as otherwise permitted by statute or by these rules, the prosecution shall be had in a district in which the offense was committed. The court shall fix the place of trial within the district with due regard to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses and the prompt administration of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn178\" id=\"fn178_ref\">178</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the text of Rule 18 refers only to convenience and prompt administration, the district court may consider other factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn179\" id=\"fn179_ref\">179</a> In this case, the court mentioned several, which we shall evaluate in turn, and we shall rule out others that are not relevant here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Convenience</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 18's \"due regard to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses\" militates strongly against transfer in this case. The record shows that the defendant and all witnesses resided in Dallas. In addition, every defense attorney practiced there, and the judge was based in Dallas. Not a single relevant event occurred outside Dallas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn180\" id=\"fn180_ref\">180</a> As \"convenience of the prosecution ... is not a factor to consider in changing venue,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn181\" id=\"fn181_ref\">181</a> the convenience facts rarely cut as totally against transfer as they did here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not mention these contra-transfer facts in its order. It merely noted that Amarillo was served by several airlines, that it was a five hours' drive from Dallas, and &#8212; perhaps inaccurately and irrelevantly &#8212; that the defendants were represented by \"retained\" counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn182\" id=\"fn182_ref\">182</a> These facts, of course, did not diminish the basic truth that trial in Amarillo was inconvenient for Lipscomb, his counsel, and all witnesses. This case is, therefore, easily distinguishable from the two cases on which the district court relied, because convenience did not militate against transfer in either of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn183\" id=\"fn183_ref\">183</a> Those cases do not support the court's <i>sua sponte</i> transfer here, and the trial court erred as a matter of law in relying on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Court Policy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court also referred to its prior transfers of \"about 100 [criminal] cases\" from Wichita Falls to Dallas (less than half the distance, we note, as Dallas to Amarillo). This historical fact, however, does not support the transfer at issue. Nothing in the record shows why those transfers took place. Such reference to the court's prior venue practice verges on circularity and runs the risk of creating a <i>per se</i> rule that violates Rule 18's focus on the facts of each case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn184\" id=\"fn184_ref\">184</a> To whatever extent the district court perceived from past transfers a generalized but informal policy regarding transfers as a matter of course, without reference to the permissible considerations under Rule 18 that may have supported those transfers, it committed legal error by including an impermissible consideration in its Rule 18 balancing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As local court policy is irrelevant, and permissible convenience considerations militated strongly against transfer to Amarillo, the issue becomes whether any other legitimate factors, discernible from the record as it stood when the order was made, sufficiently supported transfer to bring this one within the range of discretionary choices to which we must defer on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Speedy Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule's second textual factor &#8212; \"due regard to ... the prompt administration of justice\" &#8212; is in part a literal command that trials comply with the Speedy Trial Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn185\" id=\"fn185_ref\">185</a> This factor, however, did not support trial transfer in this case, as a review of the record shows. Lipscomb was indicted on March 4, 1999, and he appeared in court the next day. Trial was initially set for May 17, but Lipscomb moved for continuance. The court refused to continue the trial date indefinitely, instead setting a hearing for May at which counsel had to submit their schedules for the coming months. Counsel for Lipscomb had court engagements scheduled in each month from August through November of 1999, so at the hearing, all parties agreed on January 10, 2000, as the trial date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn186\" id=\"fn186_ref\">186</a> Later, in November, the trial court extended the trial date one day, to January 11. Early in December, 1999, Lipscomb filed another motion to continue the trial, which motion the district court promptly denied. When, on December 20, the district court unexpectedly ordered the transfer, the parties already knew that (1) trial was firmly set for January 11 and (2) there was no reason to expect that voir dire would not begin on that day. Nothing in the record suggests that facilities appropriate for the trial were unavailable in Dallas at that time. There were thus no speedy-trial issues in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did characterize the possibility of a difficult voir dire as an obstacle to \"prompt administration.\" We do not understand the term \"prompt administration\" to have been promulgated in the Rules with the intention of permitting courts to avoid even attempting arduous voir dire proceedings. Rather, the triggering purpose of the \"prompt administration\" amendment to Rule 18 was to clarify that district courts are authorized to fix the place of trial so as to comply with the Speedy Trial Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn187\" id=\"fn187_ref\">187</a> That Act concerns itself solely with the timeliness of when trial <i>begins,</i> not with when either voir dire or the entire trial will <i>conclude,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn188\" id=\"fn188_ref\">188</a> and in this circuit, trial is deemed to begin with voir dire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn189\" id=\"fn189_ref\">189</a> Because the transfer to Amarillo did not change, much less hasten, the already-scheduled start of the trial, the transfer did not accomplish the \"prompt administration\" of this case in the textual, speedy-trial sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we have held that a trial court, in its discretion, may fix the place of trial with regard to factors other than convenience and prompt administration: such factors commonly include, but are not necessarily limited to, docket management, courthouse space and security, and &#8212; most importantly for this case &#8212; pretrial publicity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Docket Management</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of docket management, we have construed the term \"prompt administration of justice\" to refer not just to the particular case that may be transferred, but also to other trials on the court's docket.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn190\" id=\"fn190_ref\">190</a> A district court may consider docket management in its Rule 18 balancing, and docket issues may even outweigh convenience factors that point entirely the other way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn191\" id=\"fn191_ref\">191</a> But nothing in the court's remarks or in the record of this case suggests that docket management was implicated here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>Logistics</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor that a court may consider in fixing the place of trial within its district is whether a particular courthouse meets a particular trial's security requirements or other facilities needs. Courtroom availability, unsurprisingly, is a permissible consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn192\" id=\"fn192_ref\">192</a> So too are the amount of jail space available there for defendants or witnesses<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn193\" id=\"fn193_ref\">193</a> and the adequacy of security arrangements in a particular criminal trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn194\" id=\"fn194_ref\">194</a> Even so, the record and transfer order here are devoid of any indication that such logistical considerations played any role in the transfer from Dallas to Amarillo, and no party argues to us that they did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">6. <i>Pretrial Publicity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial publicity, then, is the only factor that might counterbalance convenience and render the transfer to Amarillo a proper exercise of discretion. We have not delineated the quality or quantity of prejudicial publicity that will support a <i>trial court's sua sponte</i> transfer in the face of countervailing convenience factors. We have, however, defined the opposite end of the zone of deference for <i>inter</i>district transfers: When pretrial publicity is the basis for a <i>defendant's</i> motion to transfer to another district under Rule 21, a trial court errs as a matter of law in denying such a motion only if the defendant can show that pretrial publicity inflamed the jury pool, pervasively prejudiced the community against the defendant, probatively incriminated the defendant, or exceeded \"the sensationalism inherent in the crime.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn195\" id=\"fn195_ref\">195</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court neither identified nor analyzed the publicity that it conclusionally relied on as sufficiently prejudicial to require a highly inconvenient transfer over the defendant's objections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn196\" id=\"fn196_ref\">196</a> Indeed, until after the trial, the record did not even contain copies of the publicity at issue. (Notably, we have not found one criminal case in which the trial court inferred prejudice justifying a transfer from publicity of which it merely took judicial notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn197\" id=\"fn197_ref\">197</a>) The court did nothing more than globally label the unspecified publicity as \"significant\" and \"substantial\" and state that voir dire in Dallas would be \"no easy task.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn198\" id=\"fn198_ref\">198</a> But surely, this is not the standard for determining whether pretrial publicity renders a trial unfair.

Essentially, he proposes that publicity prejudicial to him may justify transfer, but publicity prejudicial to the government cannot. To support this contention, he points to the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 18, which state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place fixed for trial prejudice <i>against the defendant</i> so great as to render the trial unfair, the court may, of course, fix another place of trial within the district (if there be such) where such prejudice does not exist.

Yet, as Lipscomb correctly notes, whenever we have upheld a <i>sua sponte</i> transfer over the defendant's objection (whether the prejudice from publicity was to the government or to the defendant), a mistrial had already demonstrated that the venire pool had been badly tainted by publicity and that retrial within the transferring division would pose virtually insuperable difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our most recent ruling to this effect, in <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn209\" id=\"fn209_ref\">209</a> exemplifies this pattern: The defendant's first trial was interrupted by two bomb threats and ended in a hung jury, and his second trial ended in a mistrial after three jurors reported that they received anonymous phone calls urging them to convict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn210\" id=\"fn210_ref\">210</a> \"[C]onsiderable publicity ... from the first two trials\" resulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn211\" id=\"fn211_ref\">211</a> Under such easily distinguishable circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering an intradistrict transfer <i>sua sponte.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn212\" id=\"fn212_ref\">212</a> To the same effect are our decisions in <i>United States v.

Alvarado.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn221\" id=\"fn221_ref\">221</a> Even a cursory reading of <i>Alvarado,</i> however, shows that our terse discussion of the transfer issue there is entirely silent on several key questions: (1) Did the district court in that case transfer the case <i>sua sponte;</i> (2) if the transfer was <i>sua sponte,</i> did the district court create a record that showed prejudice by analyzing publicity or by attempting <i>voir dire;</i> (3) by what standard did the district court determine the publicity to be prejudicial; and (4) what was the nature of the publicity itself?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn222\" id=\"fn222_ref\">222</a> From the opinion, none of these issues appears to have been contested. As far as the <i>Alvarado</i> opinion goes, the defendants' argument was founded entirely on a miscitation and misunderstanding of the criminal venue statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn223\" id=\"fn223_ref\">223</a> Research into the district court case confirms not only that the <i>Alvarado</i> defendants actually moved to transfer, but also that they asked (unsuccessfully) that a newspaper reporter be instructed not to print anything concerning the rejection of a plea agreement, lest such publicity prejudice the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn224\" id=\"fn224_ref\">224</a> The <i>Alvarado</i> district court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendants' motion to transfer \"due to publicity in the area\" and took the motion under advisement until after voir dire on publicity was concluded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn225\" id=\"fn225_ref\">225</a> At that point, the district court denied the motion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn226\" id=\"fn226_ref\">226</a>; but the court later reconsidered that denial and granted the motion after a witness caused a mistrial by testifying that defendants had pled guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn227\" id=\"fn227_ref\">227</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All these facts provide context for, and render entirely understandable, the silence of our <i>Alvarado</i> opinion. These facts also completely distinguish <i>Alvarado</i> from this case: The <i>Alvarado</i> trial court did <i>not</i> transfer the case <i>sua sponte</i> as did the <i>Lipscomb</i> court; and the <i>Alvarado</i> defendants advocated transfer, unlike Lipscomb, who vigorously opposed it. Rather than undermine our conclusion here, the <i>Alvarado</i> facts confirm our impression that the transfer in the instant case was quite unusual. Any court that views <i>Alvarado</i> as trumping today's holding under our rule of orderliness will have been led into serious error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn228\" id=\"fn228_ref\">228</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have found only one case (from another circuit) that comes close to supporting the proposition for which the government contends, but that case ultimately is unpersuasive. In <i>United States v. Mabry,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn229\" id=\"fn229_ref\">229</a> a defendant moved for individual voir dire regarding pretrial publicity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn230\" id=\"fn230_ref\">230</a> The trial court interpreted this motion as raising a concern about whether trial in the Albuquerque division of the district of New Mexico would be fair &#8212; seemingly <i>to the defendants,</i> not to the government &#8212; and transferred the case, over the defendants' objections, to Roswell,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn231\" id=\"fn231_ref\">231</a> which we estimate to be some two hundred miles from Albuquerque. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit found no abuse of discretion: \"There was no substantial inconvenience to the defendants or the witnesses as a result of the transfer and no real prejudice has been demonstrated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn232\" id=\"fn232_ref\">232</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern several reasons not to follow the <i>Mabry</i> result here. First, the <i>Mabry</i> district court did not appear to transfer the case out of concern that the <i>government</i> receive a fair trial. To this extent, <i>Mabry</i> actually supports Lipscomb's contention on that point. Second, the cases on which the Tenth Circuit relied buttress <i>Mabry</i>'s result only weakly, if at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn233\" id=\"fn233_ref\">233</a> Third, <i>Mabry</i>'s transfer holding has been largely ignored by other courts, perhaps because the Supreme Court later abrogated <i>Mabry</i>'s entrapment-instruction holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn234\" id=\"fn234_ref\">234</a> <i>Mabry</i> is thus hardly persuasive authority here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here did not learn through hard experience that voir dire would be challenging. It developed no facts to suggest that the pretrial publicity presumptively or actually tainted the jury pool; it failed to analyze the publicity itself for prejudice; it applied a wrong and unrealistically high standard to determine whether the putative jury would be prejudiced; and it relied on cases of ours that are not on point. There is a plethora of support for holding that the district court abused its discretion in transferring Lipscomb's case to Amarillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">7. <i>Summary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both our precedents and persuasive authorities from other courts suggest, even if only by negative implication, that this case's facts and proceedings make it a true outlier in the Rule 18 jurisprudence. In concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in the aforementioned cases, neither we nor the other courts have purported to fix any bright-line boundary of that discretion. We are constrained to set one such limit by example, however, believing that the district court's doctrinal mistakes and clear factual errors make this case an appropriate vehicle with which to circumscribe at least one boundary of the use of Rule 18 discretion. When as here, facts of convenience militate exclusively <i>against</i> transfer, and no factor other than pretrial publicity &#8212; some favorable and some unfavorable to both the prosecution and the defense &#8212; might, if properly developed and analyzed, militate in favor of transfer, the trial court abuses its discretion under Rule 18 by ordering a far-distant intradistrict transfer, <i>sua sponte</i> and over the defendant's objections, without (1) attempting voir dire or otherwise creating a record, (2) providing an analysis of the publicity for the record to show how it prejudiced the jury pool, or (3) conducting a <i>Rideau</i>-style presumptive analysis. In this instance, we as an appellate court can detect virtually nothing on the Rule 18 scale to counterbalance the defendant's established inconvenience; and something outweighs nothing every time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the district court's abuse of discretion, we must reverse Lipscomb's conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial in a venue determined consistently with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court had jurisdiction to try Lipscomb for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, which is facially constitutional and &#8212; in my own sole opinion &#8212; is constitutional as applied to him. As we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in transferring Lipscomb's trial, however, we must reverse and remand for a new trial. The other issues Lipscomb raises on appeal are either moot, meritless, or irrelevant to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CONVICTION REVERSED, SENTENCE VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 (2000) (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>United States v.

In this manner, Judge Wiener reaches the constitutionality of &#167; 666, by calling it a jurisdictional question.

He writes: \"[A] federal forum must lack adjudicative jurisdiction to hear a case based on a federal statute that Congress lacked the legislative jurisdiction (translation: constitutional power or authority) to apply to the situation in question.\" This implies that federal courts must <i>always</i> consider constitutionality, even raising it <i>sua sponte,</i> when interpreting a statute. This elevates constitutionality to a category of claims over which we <i>always</i> have jurisdiction, and this is unsupported by our jurisprudence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully submit that Judge Wiener's is an erroneous analytical framework, and leads to inappropriate consideration of the constitutionality of &#167; 666.

This is an abstract description of our task &#8212; what it means here is that we must first determine whether Lipscomb's actions fall within the jurisdiction of &#167; 666, and if our answer is \"yes,\" then address the merits of his appeal. It is at this second step that, were constitutionality at issue, it would arise. Constitutionality is an issue on the merits, not a jurisdictional one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our governing precedent interpreting &#167; 666 does exactly this. We have first answered the jurisdictional question, and have not taken it upon ourselves to consider the constitutionality of &#167; 666 if it was not appropriately before us on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

A panel of this court affirmed her conviction. Judge King's carefully crafted opinion first considers the jurisdictional scope of &#167; 666. After finding that &#167; 666 did apply to Westmoreland's conduct, and thereby answering the jurisdictional question in the affirmative, the opinion addresses the substantive issues of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine years later, the Supreme Court decided <i>Salinas v. United States,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> an appeal of the conviction of a Texas county sheriff for accepting bribes in exchange for allowing a federal prisoner housed in the county jail to receive conjugal visits. There, the Court affirmed the sheriff's conviction, holding that federal jurisdiction under &#167; 666 is not limited to cases in which the bribe has a demonstrated effect upon federal funds. The Court later asserted the constitutionality of &#167; 666 as applied to that case. The <i>Salinas</i> decision followed the two-step approach &#8212; first determine jurisdiction, and then address whatever substantive issues are before the court. The Court decided <i>Salinas</i> on jurisdictional grounds, and then went on to mention that &#167; 666 was constitutional as applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Salinas,</i> this circuit has been faced with questions of the jurisdictional reach of &#167; 666 twice before the case at bar.

Thus, the statute's jurisdiction did not extend to his actions. No discussion of the merits was required; and the ensuing discussion on potential constitutional issues is entirely dicta, because this court was without jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our most recent holding on the applicability of &#167; 666 was in <i>United States v. Reyes,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> where we affirmed the &#167; 666 conviction of a city councilman for accepting kickbacks on city contracts. We held that whatever nexus is statutorily required for jurisdiction under &#167; 666, existed in that situation.

We must satisfy ourselves of our jurisdiction, and then go on to address whatever issues are before us on the merits. For the foregoing reasons, the constitutionality of &#167; 666 is a question on the merits that we will only address if (a) we find we have jurisdiction over this case, and (b) we find it appropriately before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Lipscomb argues that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction, because his actions do not fall within those governed by &#167; 666. He argues that jurisdiction under &#167; 666 does not extend to cases of local bribery such as his, where the underlying conduct does not directly involve federal funds. A detailed review of Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent demonstrates that his argument fails as a matter of statutory construction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) Early Fifth Circuit Precedent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first interpreted &#167; 666 in <i>United States v. Westmoreland.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> There, the defendant was a county supervisor convicted of accepting bribes in purchases of materials for the county's highway construction projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a> The district court found that the federal funds received by the county were not spent by Westmoreland,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a> and nonetheless convicted her under &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Westmoreland argued on appeal that her bribery did not fall under the jurisdiction of &#167; 666, because it did not concern federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a> We rejected this argument, concluding through statutory interpretation that federal funds need not be traceable to the \"tainted transactions\" in order for those transactions to be punishable under the statute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e find the relevant statutory language plain and unambiguous. By the terms of section 666, when a local government agency receives an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a federal assistance program, its agents are governed by the statute, and an agent violates subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct \"in <i>any</i> transaction or matter or series of transactions or matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the affairs of\" the local government agency. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(b) (Supp. 1984) [emphasis added]. Subsection (b) contains nothing to indicate that \"any transaction involving $5,000\" means \"any federally funded transaction involving $5,000\" or \"any transaction involving $5,000 of federal funds,\" and other subsections of the statute contain no inconsistent provisions that might suggest such a qualification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next reviewed the jurisdictional reach of &#167; 666 in <i>United States v. Moeller.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1\" id=\"fn18-1_ref\">18</a> There, the government appealed the dismissal of &#167; 666 claims against employees of the Texas Federal Inspection Service, state workers empowered to conduct federal inspections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-1\" id=\"fn19-1_ref\">19</a> We held that jurisdiction under &#167; 666 extended to the employees' actions, because the Texas Department of Agriculture, a \"government agency\" within &#167; 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal funds; and the defendants were \"agents\" of that federally-funded agency for purposes of &#167; 666.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20-1\" id=\"fn20-1_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

Federal funds need not be directly involved in a violation of &#167; 666. The <i>Phillips</i> panel construed the term \"agent\" narrowly, and reversed the conviction, but that is irrelevant to our case, because the term \"agent\" plainly includes city council members. The <i>Westmoreland</i> view of &#167; 666 therefore continues to be the law in this circuit, and precludes us from more narrowly construing the statute here. Because Lipscomb's actions satisfy the jurisdictional requirements found in the language of &#167; 666, we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to try Lipscomb under &#167; 666, and turn to the issues which the parties put before us on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Whether Congress had the authority it claimed to enact &#167; 666 under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, U.S. CONST., art. I, &#167; 8, is a close question. However, although my colleagues hold otherwise, it is not our question today. We may only decide those issues properly before us, and the constitutional question is not such an issue.

Judge Wiener cites this as evidence that we too should consider the constitutionality of &#167; 666 here. However, the Supreme Court's assertion in passing that &#167; 666 was constitutional as applied does not bind us to rule on the constitutionality of &#167; 666 as applied to Lipscomb here. First, we are not the Supreme Court and have different limitations on our jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, unlike us, is the definitive voice in interpreting federal statutes. <i>See</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> 571 (1994). Second, the Supreme Court in <i>Salinas</i> declined to avoid the constitutional question because it considered it a greater disservice to \"rewrite language enacted by the legislature\" than to fail to avoid the issue. <i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 59, 118 S.Ct. 469. This reasoning does not compel us to reach the constitutionality of &#167; 666 here; if anything, it counsels against that. We are <i>not</i> rewriting &#167; 666 &#8212; we are faithfully reading the language of the statute, and recognizing that in order to question the congressionally-enacted language, the issue of constitutionality must be explicitly before us.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29-1_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> 529 U.S. 667, 120 S.Ct. 1780, 146 L.Ed.2d 707 (2000)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30-1_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> <i>See id.,</i> 529 U.S. at 669-70, 681, 120 S.Ct. at 1782-83, 1788-89.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31-1_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> 219 F.3d 404 (5th Cir.2000)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32-1_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> <i>See United States v.

I seek no magic words; I wish only that the parties would clearly raise those issues they wish us and the district court to decide (as our precedent requires). The parties here did not meet even this most-light burden on the issue of the constitutionality of &#167; 666.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, Judge Smith accuses me of invoking the \"rigid form pleading\" that was eliminated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This misunderstands my analysis. To the contrary, I am not concerned with what the parties raise in the complaints and answers that set out in broad brushstrokes the case they intend to bring. However, we must (and our precedent shows we do) require parties to specifically argue before us and the district court, at some point during the adjudication of their dispute, what issues they wish decided. The courts are not required to divine what issues are before them, nor do they have the power to choose what issues they would like to be before them &#8212; that is the responsibility of the parties.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The conclusions of Judge Wiener and Judge Smith place a burden on the trial court to read between the lines of the parties' arguments and ascertain what the parties \"should have\" or \"could have\" argued. That is just not the way our judicial system works. The burden lies with the parties to place a case or controversy before the court. On the issue of constitutionality, that burden was not met here. Requiring judges to act as mindreaders, as Judge Wiener and Judge Smith do here, cannot be an acceptable part of our judicial system.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p297\">\n      <span class=\"num\">297</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the conviction and render a judgment of dismissal with prejudice, thereby precluding a retrial of defendant Albert Lipscomb. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the contrary result reached by Judge Wiener's opinion and Judge Duh&#233;'s partial concurrence, which is to subject this seventy-seven-year-old defendant &#8212; who has already served more than half of his approximately three and one-half-year sentence of incarceration waiting for his appeal to be decided &#8212; to a new trial under a statute that has no application to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p298\">\n      <span class=\"num\">298</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of the three judges on this panel are of the view that Lipscomb properly raised the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 is unconstitutional as applied to him. Nonetheless, we fail to decide that issue because one of the judges declines to address it, leaving the other two judges evenly split on the question. If we were to address it, we should easily conclude that Congress has no authority to criminalize Lipscomb's conduct, and the government had no authority to subject him to a first trial, let alone a second one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p299\">\n      <span class=\"num\">299</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Duh&#233; is correct that \"[c]onstitutionality is an issue on the merits, not a jurisdictional one.\" He also accurately states that a criminal defendant may waive constitutional challenges to a statute by failing to argue them. Although Judge Duh&#233; follows the proper methodology by looking to Lipscomb's four trial motions and his appellate brief for the answer, Judge Duh&#233; errs in applying a hyper-technical test in reviewing Lipscomb's arguments, a test that elevates semantics over substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p300\">\n      <span class=\"num\">300</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry is a relatively easy one: Has Lipscomb argued that Congress cannot reach his conduct under the United States Constitution? When we focus on the text of Lipscomb's motions and briefs, we can have no doubt that the answer is yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p301\">\n      <span class=\"num\">301</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Duh&#233; argues that Lipscomb's September 3, 1999, \"Motion To Dismiss the Indictment or, Alternatively, for an Evidentiary Hearing Requiring the Government To Establish Federal Jurisdiction\" is a motion that \"seeks proof of federal jurisdiction, and does not challenge the constitutionality of &#167; 666.\" But the full text shows that Lipscomb is making a constitutional argument; he just uses the words \"jurisdiction\" and \"power\" interchangeably:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p302\">\n      <span class=\"num\">302</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in <i>Salinas,</i> the Court squarely left open the question whether Section 666 \"requires some other kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of federal funds\" lest it be applied in some manner which <i>would alter or fail to \"give proper respect to the federal-state balance\" of powers</i> [quoting <i>Salinas</i>]. The Court found \"no serious doubt about <i>the constitutionality of Section 666(a)(1)(B) as applied</i> to the facts of this case\" [quoting <i>Salinas</i>].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p303\">\n      <span class=\"num\">303</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, no sufficient jurisdictional basis is evident.... Any exercise of federal jurisdiction must demonstrate a proper respect for concepts of <i>dual sovereignty and federalism.</i> On its face, this indictment fails even to allege an appropriate basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction and accordingly <i>Section 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in this case.</i>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p304\">\n      <span class=\"num\">304</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Tenth Amendment</i> ... provides: [quoting] ... \"[T]he `double security' embodied in the concept of federalism requires `a proper balance between the States and the Federal Government'\" [citing <i>Gregory v. Ashcroft,</i> 501 U.S. 452, 459, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991)]. The States' <i>constitutional</i> prerogatives plainly include their \"<i>constitutional</i> responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own government....\" Under our federal system, states possess the primary authority to define and enforce criminal law [citing <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 561 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995)].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p305\">\n      <span class=\"num\">305</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the application of Section 666 in circumstances with no evident assertion of a federal interest offends two state prerogatives: (1) the States' <i>constitutional responsibility</i> for regulation of electoral government and for the establishment and operation of its own government and the qualifications of its officials; and (2) the definition and enforcement of criminal law. <i>As a constitutional principle, it simply cannot be that $10,000.00 in federal funds provided to a major city trumps the Tenth Amendment and the prerogatives and responsibilities reserved to the States therein. The Tenth Amendment,</i> after all, \"was enacted to allay lingering concerns about the extent of national power\" [citing <i>Alden v. Maine,</i> 527 U.S. 706, 713-14, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999)]. \"When the Federal Government asserts authority over a States' [<i>sic</i>] most fundamental political processes, its [<i>sic</i>] strikes at the heart of the political accountability so essential to our liberty and <i>republican form of government</i>\" [citing <i>Alden</i>; <i>Printz v.

[F]ederal jurisdiction is being exercised in a manner that plainly intrudes upon the prerogative of the States to define, apply and enforce criminal law, and to monitor and oversee the operation of its government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p307\">\n      <span class=\"num\">307</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p308\">\n      <span class=\"num\">308</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Lipscomb were merely arguing jurisdiction, why would he five times cite <i>Salinas</i> &#8212; which does not even mention jurisdiction &#8212; for the proposition that &#167; 666 has been unconstitutionally applied to him? Why would he employ a \"Special Counsel for Tenth Amendment purposes only,\" and have that counsel sign the motion? Why would he twice invoke the Tenth Amendment and cite the Tenth Amendment cases of <i>Gregory, Printz,</i> and <i>New York v. United States,</i> as well as <i>Alden</i>'s Tenth Amendment discussion? Why would he six times argue that &#167; 666 abridges the states' constitutional responsibilities and prerogatives? Why would he three times argue that &#167; 666 upsets the constitution's federal-state balance of powers? Why would he three times state that &#167; 666 is being unconstitutionally applied to him?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p309\">\n      <span class=\"num\">309</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Duh&#233; sidesteps all of this and, instead, notes that the motion's title mentions federal jurisdiction, not constitutionality, and Lipscomb uses the word \"jurisdiction\" throughout his argument. Since when do we accord one word such talismanic power that its mere presence or absence in a motion or brief can negate all remaining arguments? Since when do we forbid a defendant from raising two points &#8212; both constitutionality and jurisdiction &#8212; in one motion? The Federal Rules of Procedure eliminated just the type of rigid form pleading that Judge Duh&#233; invokes today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p310\">\n      <span class=\"num\">310</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb's motion is less than polished, and his interchange of \"jurisdiction\" and \"power\" is clumsy. As Judge Wiener explains, sometimes Lipscomb uses \"jurisdiction\" to refer to a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction, and sometimes he uses \"jurisdiction\" to refer to the persons and acts over which Congress may legislate. But any confusion is easily eliminated: Substitute \"federal power\" or \"congressional power\" every time Lipscomb says \"jurisdiction\" in his motion, and the motion's meaning remains the same. But substitute \"subject matter jurisdiction\" or \"federal court jurisdiction,\" and parts of the motion become nonsensical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p311\">\n      <span class=\"num\">311</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the final paragraph makes no sense when \"federal court jurisdiction\" is used:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p312\">\n      <span class=\"num\">312</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proper state-federal balance is disturbed when there is an intrusion upon State prerogatives in important areas reserved to the States. This indictment fails to identify the federal interest served by this exercise of [<i>federal court jurisdiction</i>] and therefore constitutes an unconstitutional application of Section 666.... [<i>Federal court jurisdiction</i>] is being exercised in a manner that plainly intrudes upon the prerogative of the States to define, apply and enforce criminal law, and to monitor and oversee the operation of its government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p313\">\n      <span class=\"num\">313</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this paragraph reads perfectly well when \"congressional power\" is filled in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p314\">\n      <span class=\"num\">314</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb's lack of artfulness should not doom his appeal, especially given that the Supreme Court and our circuit often have been guilty of the same offense of conflating \"jurisdiction\" and \"power.\" In <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), the Court acknowledged that it has sometimes employed a \"somewhat expansive notion of jurisdiction\" that covered both general constitutional questions and the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 1784-85 (internal quotations omitted). Recently, the en banc court of this circuit reheard <i>United States v. Longoria,</i> 259 F.3d 363 (5th Cir.), <i>vacated for rehearing en banc,</i> 262 F.3d 455 (5th Cir.2001), to undo the confusion generated by our loose use of the term \"jurisdiction.\" Lipscomb should not be held to a higher standard of legal diction than are the judges and Justices of this court and the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p315\">\n      <span class=\"num\">315</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Duh&#233; and I also read Lipscomb's February 8, 2000, motion for judgment of acquittal quite differently. Lipscomb made, <i>inter alia,</i> the following arguments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p316\">\n      <span class=\"num\">316</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As applied to Lipscomb, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 is unconstitutional.</i> No evidence was introduced that any of the funds given to Lipscomb can be connected to \"a threat to the integrity and proper function of a federal program.\" None of the federal funds was shown to relate to the taxicab industry. At no time did any of the votes alleged in the indictment impinge upon the use, distribution, diversion or application of any federal funds. Congress intended to protect federal and the integrity of those funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p317\">\n      <span class=\"num\">317</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p318\">\n      <span class=\"num\">318</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb flatly states that &#167; 666 is unconstitutional as applied to him, and he follows with a constitutional argument from <i>Salinas.</i> The <i>Salinas</i> Court explained that because the crime \"was a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program[, w]hatever might be said about &#167; 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in other cases, the application of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.\" <i>Salinas v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 52, 61, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997). Lipscomb argues the inverse &#8212; because his crime did not threaten the integrity and proper operation of a federal program, the application of &#167; 666 to him is not constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p319\">\n      <span class=\"num\">319</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Duh&#233; recharacterizes this argument as a challenge to the jurisdictional reach of &#167; 666; Lipscomb, he concludes, actually is asserting that &#167; 666 requires a nexus between federal funds and the bribery. Judge Duh&#233; does not explain why, if this is so, Lipscomb failed to place this argument under heading B of his motion &#8212; \"The Government has failed to establish the jurisdictional prerequisite for each substantive count.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p320\">\n      <span class=\"num\">320</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Judge Duh&#233; explain why Lipscomb would support this argument by quoting from the same passage in <i>Salinas</i> that held, \"The text of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) is unambiguous ... [and] does not require the Government to prove federal funds were involved in the bribery transaction.\" <i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 60, 118 S.Ct. 469. Instead, Judge Duh&#233; notes that neither the government nor the district court mentioned the constitutional issue. Just because the district court and the government may have misunderstood Lipscomb's claim, however, does not mean he failed to present it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p321\">\n      <span class=\"num\">321</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb devotes ten pages of his appellate brief to the constitutional issue. Even though Lipscomb admits that \"[i]t is not a jurisdictional requirement of [&#167;] 666 that the alleged bribe actually affect federal funds,\" Judge Duh&#233; insists that Lipscomb is making only a jurisdictional argument. More incredibly, Judge Duh&#233; claims Lipscomb \"never mentions a constitutional question,\" even though Lipscomb states, \"there must be some connection between the bribe and the expenditure of federal funds. Otherwise, the reach of &#167; 666 intrudes well beyond the scope of federal authority into areas of state responsibility, and <i>serious constitutional questions are presented.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p322\">\n      <span class=\"num\">322</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb further notes that the <i>Salinas</i> Court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p323\">\n      <span class=\"num\">323</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">left open the question whether Section 666 \"requires some other kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of federal funds\" lest it be applied in some manner which <i>would alter or fail to \"give respect to the federal-state balance\" of powers</i> [citation]. \"Whatever might be said about [&#167;] 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in other cases, the <i>application of Section 666(a)(1)(B)</i> to Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.\" [citation].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p324\">\n      <span class=\"num\">324</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb follows with the observation that \"[a]ny exercise of federal jurisdiction must demonstrate a proper respect for <i>concepts of dual sovereignty and federalism</i> (citing the <i>Tenth Amendment</i>). The States' <i>constitutional prerogatives</i> plainly include <i>constitutional</i> responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own government.... [citing <i>Gregory,</i> 501 U.S. at 462, 111 S.Ct. 2395].\" He adds, \"As a <i>constitutional principle,</i> it simply cannot be that $10,000.00 in federal funds provided to a major city trumps the <i>Tenth Amendment and the prerogatives and responsibilities reserved to the States</i>\" (referring also to our \"<i>republican form of government</i>\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p325\">\n      <span class=\"num\">325</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb further argues that &#167; 666 is enacted under the <i>Spending Clause,</i> which has limits. Beyond those limits, the \"delicate balance of federalism\" is obliterated, he argues. Finally, Lipscomb notes that a prosecution under &#167; 666 must be \"undergirded by some adequate federal jurisdictional base\" to avoid <i>serious constitutional problems.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p326\">\n      <span class=\"num\">326</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Lipscomb uses the term \"jurisdiction\" loosely, and he sometimes makes two arguments under one heading in his brief. Nonetheless, he easily has raised adequately the requisite constitutional arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p327\">\n      <span class=\"num\">327</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the caption of this opinion as a dissent, this part II is not a dissent, because there is no majority decision, on this issue, from which to dissent. Judge Wiener opines that &#167; 666 is constitutional as applied, and I conclude, to the contrary, that the statute is unconstitutional as applied. But Judge Duh&#233; declines to address this issue, even in the alternative, despite that it is law of the case, under the majority holding of two judges, that the issue is properly raised and preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p328\">\n      <span class=\"num\">328</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, although a majority of this court holds that Lipscomb properly raised and preserved this constitutional challenge, and although this challenge, if decided, could lead to Lipscomb's immediate release with no possibility of retrial, we do not rule on it. The government had no authority to try Lipscomb the first time around; instead of announcing that fact and ending these proceedings, we compound the error by forcing Lipscomb to undergo a second illegitimate trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p329\">\n      <span class=\"num\">329</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The full absurdity of today's decision comes to light when we imagine the future of this case. If Lipscomb is convicted a second time, he presumably will appeal (if he lives that long; he is elderly and too ill to be incarcerated in prison). In his second appeal, Lipscomb could argue the same constitutional claim before this same court &#8212; perhaps even before this same panel &#8212; and this time, because he was careful to omit the word \"jurisdiction\" from his brief, he could be acquitted and told that the government never had the power to try or detain him in the first case. As I explain below, this should be our decision today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p330\">\n      <span class=\"num\">330</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Judge Wiener explains, <i>Westmoreland</i>'s broad construction of &#167; 666 continues to be the law in this circuit, so we are precluded from construing the statute to avoid a constitutional question. We must, perforce, examine Lipscomb's constitutional challenge to the statute as applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p331\">\n      <span class=\"num\">331</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted &#167; 666 under the Spending Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a> <i>Phillips,</i> 219 F.3d at 414. It is well recognized that Congress may use its spending power to regulate the states indirectly through the use of conditional grants. E.g., 1 LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW &#167; 5-6, at 833 (3d ed. 2000). The power to regulate indirectly is nevertheless a limited one, as explained in <i>South Dakota v. Dole,</i> 483 U.S. 203, 207-08, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p332\">\n      <span class=\"num\">332</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dole</i> involved a statute conditioning a small portion of each state's federal highway aid on the state's establishing a minimum drinking age. <i>Id.</i> at 205, 107 S.Ct. 2793. The Court upheld the condition based on Congress's authority under the Spending Clause to \"condition\" states' access to federal funds. <i>Id.</i> at 206, 107 S.Ct. 2793. The Court held that when Congress chooses to go beyond specific enumerated powers and to use its spending power \"to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal monies upon compliance with federal statutory and administrative directives,\" it must meet four conditions, the failure to meet any of which might render a statute unconstitutionally broad: (1) The power must be used in pursuit of the general welfare; (2) Congress must state any conditions unambiguously; (3) conditions must be related to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs; and (4) conditions must not violate other independent constitutional restrictions on government activity. <i>Id.</i> at 207-08, 107 S.Ct. 2793.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p333\">\n      <span class=\"num\">333</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Dole</i> test is inappropriate to analyze the constitutionality of &#167; 666, however, because the section does not qualify as a conditional-grant statute. First, &#167; 666 does not unambiguously state that certain conditions attach to the receipt of any particular federal grants. Second, a condition statute generally requires a state's compliance with federal regulatory or administrative directives in exchange for receipt of federal funds. <i>Va. Dep't of Educ. v. Riley,</i> 106 F.3d 559, 570-72 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (plurality opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p334\">\n      <span class=\"num\">334</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 666, however, neither requires an act of compliance nor applies directly to the recipient governments, as did the statute in <i>Oklahoma v. United States Civil Serv. Comm'n,</i> 330 U.S. 127, 67 S.Ct. 544, 91 L.Ed. 794 (1947).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2\" id=\"fn3-2_ref\">3</a> Instead, &#167; 666 applies directly to individuals; as the court in <i>United States v. Cantor,</i> 897 F.Supp. 110, 113 (S.D.N.Y.1995), stated persuasively, &#167; 666 does not impose <i>any</i> conditions at all, much less conditions related to federal interests, on particular national projects or programs: \"18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 does not impose a condition on the receipt of federal funds. The statute neither requires a state's compliance with federal regulatory or administrative directives, nor prevents state action.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, &#167; 666 cannot be classified as a conditional grant to the states,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a> and, correspondingly, <i>Dole</i> cannot be applied to analyze its constitutionality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-2\" id=\"fn5-2_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p335\">\n      <span class=\"num\">335</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that <i>Dole</i> does not answer the question, we turn elsewhere for constitutional grounding. In <i>Salinas,</i> the Court held &#167; 666 constitutional as applied, addressing constitutionality only briefly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p336\">\n      <span class=\"num\">336</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here is no serious doubt about the constitutionality of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of this case. Beltran was without question a prisoner held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of agreements with the Federal Government. The preferential treatment accorded to him was a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program. Whatever might be said about &#167; 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in other cases, the application of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds. See <i>Westfall v. United States,</i> 274 U.S. 256, 259, 47 S.Ct. 629, 71 L.Ed. 1036 (1927).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p337\">\n      <span class=\"num\">337</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 60-61, 118 S.Ct. 469. Unfortunately, the Court did not reveal the framework it used in concluding that &#167; 666 was constitutionally applied in <i>Salinas,</i> nor did it say what test should be used in determining whether other applications of the statute are constitutional. We conduct our own inquiry, because this case, unlike <i>Salinas,</i> does not involve any readily apparent connection to federal funds or programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p338\">\n      <span class=\"num\">338</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have said, the fact that &#167; 666 is not a direct exercise of the spending power does not doom its constitutionality. The Constitution gives Congress the power \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" U.S. CONST. art. I, &#167; 8. Thus, to determine whether the application of &#167; 666 to Lipscomb's acceptance of bribes by a local taxi company is constitutional, we must decide whether prosecuting such behavior is \"necessary and proper\" to carrying out Congress's spending power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2\" id=\"fn6-2_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p339\">\n      <span class=\"num\">339</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine the relevant legislative history to discover why Congress thought that &#167; 666 was necessary and for what purposes it deemed the statute proper, for although Congress is not the final judge of what is necessary and proper to carry out its powers, it is likely to have an informed opinion on the matter. Such opinion is particularly persuasive to the extent that it finds legislation is necessary and proper only in limited circumstances, because, in such cases, we need not worry that Congress's interpretation is motivated by a desire to expand its power beyond proper bounds. Thus, when Congress states that legislation passed as necessary and proper to carry out one of its enumerated powers is actually necessary only in certain circumstances, we should be hesitant to conclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits the legislation to reach further than Congress felt necessary or proper to carry out its delegated powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p340\">\n      <span class=\"num\">340</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have recognized the particular relevance of the legislative history of &#167; 666 in cases &#8212; like this &#8212; in which that history shows Congress's limited goals in drafting a broadly worded statute. The legislative history of the act shows that Congress passed &#167; 666 because it was concerned with its inability to protect federal funds once they are transferred from the federal government to states, local governments, and agencies. Section 666 \"is designed to create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery involving Federal monies that are disbursed to private organizations or State and local governments pursuant to a Federal program.\" 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510 (emphasis added). Congress also stated that \"the purpose of this section [is] to protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p341\">\n      <span class=\"num\">341</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Salinas,</i> the Court noted that &#167; 666 was enacted in response to specific difficulties the federal government had encountered under preceding statutes in prosecuting the theft of federal funds by non-federal employees. The Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p342\">\n      <span class=\"num\">342</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before &#167; 666 was enacted, the federal criminal code contained a single, general bribery provision codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201. Section 201 by its terms applied only to \"public official[s],\" which the statute defined as \"officer[s] or employee[s] or person[s] acting for or on behalf of the United States....\" &#167; 201(a). The Courts of Appeals divided over whether state and local employees could be considered \"public officials\" under &#167; 201(a) .... &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) was designed to extend federal bribery prohibitions to bribes offered to state and local officials employed by agencies receiving federal funds. The facts and reasoning of <i>[United States v.] Del Toro,</i> [513 F.2d 656, 661-62 (2d Cir.1975)], give particular instruction in this respect. In that case, the Second Circuit held that a city employee was not a \"public official\" under &#167; 201(a) even though federal funds would eventually cover 100% of the costs and 80% of the salaries of the program he administered. 513 F.2d, at 662. Because the program had not yet entered a formal request for federal funding, the Second Circuit reasoned, \"[t]here were no existing committed federal funds for the purpose.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The enactment of &#167; 666 forecloses this type of limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p343\">\n      <span class=\"num\">343</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 58-59, 118 S.Ct. 469. Moreover, in <i>United States v. Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d 672, 684 (3d Cir.1999), the court explained that under a separate statute criminalizing the theft of federal property, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 641,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p344\">\n      <span class=\"num\">344</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the federal government could prosecute only when it could establish that the stolen property was property of the United States, which often was impossible if title had passed before the property was stolen or when federal funds were so commingled with non-federal funds that the federal character of those funds could not be shown.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-2\" id=\"fn7-2_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p345\">\n      <span class=\"num\">345</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Senate Report states that the intent of &#167; 666 is \"to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the types involved in the <i>Del Toro, Hinton,</i> and <i>Mosley</i> cases cited herein[.]\" S. REP. No. 98-225, 369-370, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3511. The court in <i>Zwick</i> noted that the corrupt transactions in these three cases all plainly implicated federal interests. <i>Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d at 684.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p346\">\n      <span class=\"num\">346</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Del Toro,</i> the defendants conspired to bribe Pedro Morales, the Assistant Administrator of the Harlem-East Harlem Model Cities Program, for which the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") paid 100% of the cost of the program and 80% of its salaries. Because Morales was a city employee, however, the court concluded that, notwithstanding that he was administering a HUD program, he was not a \"public official\" for purposes of &#167; 201 and therefore could not be prosecuted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p347\">\n      <span class=\"num\">347</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in <i>United States v. Hinton,</i> 683 F.2d 195, 198-200 (7th Cir.1982), <i>aff'd sub nom. Dixson v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 482, 104 S.Ct. 1172, 79 L.Ed.2d 458 (1984), the defendants were officials of a non-profit corporation that administered a HUD program and had discretion in the distribution of HUD funds. The court found that they were \"public officials for purposes of &#167; 201 because they exercised considerable discretion in the distribution of federal funds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 198-200. The Supreme Court affirmed but noted that, to be a \"public official\" under &#167; 201(a), \"an individual must possess some degree of responsibility for carrying out a federal program or policy.... Individuals who work for block grant recipients and business people who provide recipients with goods and services cannot be said to be public officials under section 201(a) unless they assume some duties of an official nature.\" <i>Dixson v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 482, 499-500, 104 S.Ct. 1172, 79 L.Ed.2d 458 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p348\">\n      <span class=\"num\">348</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Mosley,</i> 659 F.2d 812, 816 (7th Cir.1981), the defendant, an Illinois state employee, was convicted of receiving bribes while evaluating applicants for jobs under a federally-funded program. Here again, the defendant was covered by &#167; 201, because he exercised discretion in the administration of federal funds. In <i>Zwick,</i> the court concluded that the inclusion of these cases as examples of conduct that would be covered by &#167; 666 showed that Congress intended that the statute would be applied only in corruption cases impacting federal interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-2\" id=\"fn8-2_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p349\">\n      <span class=\"num\">349</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I do not agree that the plain language of &#167; 666 allows prosecution only where the charged corrupt activity has impact on a federal interest, the fact that Congress did not find it necessary that &#167; 666 be applied in cases not involving federal funds or programs is highly relevant to the issue of whether the statute's application to local corruption not involving federal funds is \"necessary and proper\" to execute the spending power. Armed with knowledge of Congress's purpose in enacting &#167; 666, I examine whether the statute's employment here &#8212; to prosecute a city councilmember for accepting bribes in return for pursuing local taxi regulations beneficial to a local taxi company &#8212; is \"necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the spending power. In other words, what are the minimum factors that must be present to make a prosecution under &#167; 666 \"necessary and proper\" under the spending power? I am aware of no court that has dealt with the issue of what uses of &#167; 666 are necessary and proper to effect the spending power. Of no help is <i>United States v. Suarez,</i> 263 F.3d 468 (6th Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-2\" id=\"fn9-2_ref\">9</a> The Second and Third Circuits have narrowly interpreted &#167; 666, however, for the express purpose of avoiding a constitutional question. Their views on what limitations are necessary to keep &#167; 666 within the realm of constitutionality are therefore useful. In <i>Zwick,</i> the court interpreted &#167; 666 to require a relationship between the prohibited conduct and a federal interest, because doing otherwise would raise constitutional problems:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p350\">\n      <span class=\"num\">350</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting &#167; 666 to have no federal interest requirement produces serious concerns as to whether Congress exceeded its power under the Spending Clause in enacting this statute. <i>See McCormack,</i> 31 F.Supp.2d at 187-89. To pass muster under the Spending Clause, legislation regulating behavior of entities receiving federal funds must, among other things, be based upon a federal interest in the particular conduct. <i>See South Dakota v. Dole,</i> 483 U.S. 203, 207, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). Applying &#167; 666 to offense conduct, absent evidence of any federal interest, would appear to be an unconstitutional exercise of power under the Spending Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p351\">\n      <span class=\"num\">351</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d at 687 (footnote omitted). The court thus rejected the government's position that no connection between the bribery and the federal funds was necessary beyond proof that the agency in question had received federal funds in excess of $10,000. To do otherwise, the court reasoned, would eviscerate significant federal-state boundaries by turning &#167; 666 into a general anti-corruption statute, an intention not expressed by Congress. <i>Id.</i> at 686.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-2\" id=\"fn10-2_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p352\">\n      <span class=\"num\">352</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the pre-<i>Salinas</i> case of <i>United States v. Foley,</i> 73 F.3d 484, 493 (2d Cir.1996), the court held that the conduct prosecuted under &#167; 666 must be \"shown in some way to touch upon federal funds.\" The court also held that the local government or agency whose transaction involves $5,000 or more and at which the corruption is aimed must itself receive at least $10,000 in federal funds. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p353\">\n      <span class=\"num\">353</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court re-evaluated <i>Foley</i> post-<i>Salinas</i> in <i>United States v. Santopietro,</i> 166 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.1999), recognizing that <i>Salinas</i> had made plain that the corruption need not have a value of $5,000 to the local government on which the corruption is practiced. Instead, there only must be the receipt of at least $10,000 of federal funds and a corrupt transaction valued at $5,000 or more by any of the parties &#8212; the local government, the party paying the bribe, or the bribe recipient. Thus, the <i>Santopietro</i> court reversed and held that the defendants could be convicted under &#167; 666. Even though the bribery at issue did not result in a loss of $5,000 or more to the town, the statutory requirement that a transaction of at least $5,000 be involved was plainly satisfied by the fact that the total bribe was $25,000. <i>Id.</i> at 92-93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p354\">\n      <span class=\"num\">354</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Santopietro,</i> however, did not retreat from <i>Foley</i>'s requirement of \"at least some connection between the bribe and a risk to the integrity of the federal funded [sic] program,\" because \"nothing in <i>Salinas</i> disturbs such a requirement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 93. The court held that a federal connection sufficient to satisfy &#167; 666 existed where real estate developers had made corrupt payments to the mayor, the Republican town chairman, and the president of the board of aldermen to secure their influence in landing city development contracts that were substantially funded by HUD dollars. <i>Id.</i> The court held that the evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p355\">\n      <span class=\"num\">355</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">satisfies the requirements of <i>Foley,</i> undisturbed by <i>Salinas,</i> that the transaction sought to be influenced had some connection with a federal program. Indeed, <i>Salinas</i> may be read to indicate that the \"threat to the integrity and proper operation of [a] federal program\" created by the corrupt activity is necessary to assure that the statute is not unconstitutionally applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p356\">\n      <span class=\"num\">356</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Salinas</i> 522 U.S. at 60-61, 118 S.Ct. 469) (citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p357\">\n      <span class=\"num\">357</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made plain that there was a direct connection between the bribery and the federally-funded programs and that \"this is not a case where the transactions sought to be influenced concerned one department of a city and the requisite $10,000 of federal funds were received by a totally unrelated department.\" <i>Id.</i> at 93-94. The court stated that \"even after <i>Salinas,</i> [the undisturbed requirements of] <i>Foley</i> would not permit the Government to use &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) to prosecute a bribe paid to a city's meat inspector in connection with a substantial transaction just because the city's parks department had received a federal grant of $10,000.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-2\" id=\"fn11-2_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p358\">\n      <span class=\"num\">358</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning of the Second and Third Circuits is persuasive. It is a tautology to say that for legislation to be necessary and proper for effecting the spending power, it must be related to that power in some way. In other words, prohibiting activity that is unrelated to federal spending or programs cannot be necessary to execute the spending power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p359\">\n      <span class=\"num\">359</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that only activity that directly affects federal funds may be prohibited. <i>Salinas</i> made evident that the spending power can be rendered ineffectual not only where the integrity of federal funds is compromised, but also where the integrity of programs funded by those federal dollars is assaulted. Thus, in <i>Salinas</i> the Court found that &#167; 666 did not \"extend federal power beyond its proper bounds,\" <i>id.</i> at 61, 118 S.Ct. 469, where the statute was used to prosecute a state officer who had allowed himself to be bribed to influence his management of a federally funded program, even though no federal funds actually were diverted. In <i>Zwick,</i> the court held that \"a highly attenuated implication of a federal interest will suffice for purposes of &#167; 666.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-2\" id=\"fn12-2_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p360\">\n      <span class=\"num\">360</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government goes far beyond the holding of <i>Salinas</i> and argues that for a prosecution to be proper under &#167; 666, no relationship at all is required between federal funds or programs and local corruption. The government argues that because funds are fungible, and the receipt of federal funds for any project frees a state to spend more funds on other projects, no more is required for a prosecution under &#167; 666 than that a local government receive at least $10,000 in federal funds annually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p361\">\n      <span class=\"num\">361</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is, strictly speaking, a correct textual interpretation of &#167; 666, the statute obviously does not satisfy constitutional requirements when used in this manner; it cannot be necessary and proper to executing the spending power for the government to prosecute local crimes that have no relationship whatsoever to federal funds and programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p362\">\n      <span class=\"num\">362</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any argument that it is \"necessary\" to protect the spending power by passing legislation that regulates conduct totally unrelated to federal spending is meritless on its face. Accepting this proposition would allow &#167; 666 to become a general federal police power statute that criminalizes corruption in all local governments and private agencies receiving federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p363\">\n      <span class=\"num\">363</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a general police power is denied the federal government by constitutional design, for it is among those powers, reserved to the states, that constitute the heart of state sovereignty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-2\" id=\"fn13-2_ref\">13</a> Furthermore, states have the primary authority to define and enforce criminal law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-2\" id=\"fn14-2_ref\">14</a> <i>United States v.

Central to that balance, and to state sovereignty, is each state's prerogative over the \"constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own government....\" <i>Id.</i> at 462, 111 S.Ct. 2395.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p364\">\n      <span class=\"num\">364</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress may pass laws criminalizing conduct that is already proscribed by the states, but this \"change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-2\" id=\"fn15-2_ref\">15</a> must be made under the powers delegated to the federal government by the Constitution. If adopted, the government's argument that it is necessary and proper, under the Spending Clause, for the federal government to root out all local corruption whenever more than $10,000 of federal funds is received by a local government would cause a massive shift in the \"balance between the States and the Federal Government\" that is contrary to basic concepts of federalism and the Tenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-2\" id=\"fn16-2_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p365\">\n      <span class=\"num\">365</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This power cannot be said to be necessary and proper to carrying into execution the spending power, because the means are not appropriate, are well beyond \"the scope of the constitution,\" are inconsistent \"with the letter and spirit of the constitution,\" and thus are unconstitutional. <i>McCulloch v. Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316, 17 U.S. 316, 421, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-2\" id=\"fn17-2_ref\">17</a> Moreover, the government's argument that no connection need be shown between federal funds or programs and the local corruption prosecuted under &#167; 666 confuses a connection to a federal interest in federally-funded programs with the federal government's generalized interest in everything that occurs within its borders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p366\">\n      <span class=\"num\">366</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the United States has an interest in the honesty of all officials, local and federal, and this is assuredly so. The government has a similar interest in a great many things that are, however, beyond its power to regulate directly. For example, members of Congress profess sincere interest in a variety of problems &#8212; from reducing crime to encouraging the stability of marriage &#8212; yet Congress has no more power directly to criminalize local burglaries than it does to regulate marriage directly. In both cases, if the government wishes to pursue its interest, it must do so through targeted spending and conditional grants of federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-2\" id=\"fn18-2_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p367\">\n      <span class=\"num\">367</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this conflation of generalized federal interests with a federal interest in a program (i.e., a connection to federal funding) that prompts the government to argue that any generalized interest of the United States suffices to allow federal criminalization of local matters, so long as some insignificant amount of federal funds are given to the locality. Such an analysis turns the accepted understanding of the Necessary and Proper Clause on its head and, in effect, asserts that because Congress may pursue the general welfare through the Spending Clause, all laws that are necessary and proper to the general welfare must be considered constitutional under the Spending Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-2\" id=\"fn19-2_ref\">19</a> This argument, if followed, would overturn the accepted meaning of the Spending and the General Welfare Clauses that has existed for nearly two centuries. <i>See generally</i> 1 TRIBE, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 5-6, at 831-34 (3d ed. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p368\">\n      <span class=\"num\">368</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, alternatively, that if a connection is required between federal funding or programs and the charged corruption, such connection is present in this case. The federal connection that the government asserts, however, is exceedingly tenuous. The government avers that a federal connection existed between Lipscomb's acts of corruption and federal funds because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p369\">\n      <span class=\"num\">369</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb voted to seek and disburse federal money on improvements to Love Field airport. Thus, the federal government had an interest in the success of the airport, a center of interstate travel. It is common sense that an airport depends in part for its success on the taxicab service provided for passengers. On the flip side, taxicabs depend in part for their success on the viability of airports, which provide fertile ground for fares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p370\">\n      <span class=\"num\">370</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If merely the airport &#8212; rather than the city as a whole &#8212; is seen as the analog of the jail in <i>Salinas,</i> that case's holding must extend to this one. Lipscomb, like the jailer, was partly responsible for managing a federally-funded entity, the airport. The airport in turn provided business to, and needed the business of, taxicabs (including Richards' taxicabs) for its success &#8212; just as the jail had a direct relationship with the welfare of the prisoner who paid the bribes. And just as the preferential treatment given to the prisoner was \"a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program,\" <i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 61, 118 S.Ct. 469, so the preferential treatment of Richards was a threat to the integrity of the airport-funding program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p371\">\n      <span class=\"num\">371</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's \"cabs go to the airport\" theory is feeble at best. The government may as well argue that because the United States funds medical research at Dallas hospitals, and researchers sometimes take taxis, especially to airports to fly to conferences, there is a sufficient nexus between taxis and federal funds. Or, the government could aver that federal funds go to pay welfare benefits and, because welfare recipients often cannot afford cars, they may take taxis to the grocery store to use their food stamps, and thus federal prosecution of cases of local bribery affecting taxi regulations is necessary to protect the spending power. In sum, if the government's posited connection between the federal funds and the corruption is sufficient to provide nexus, any connection at all will do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p372\">\n      <span class=\"num\">372</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case reveal no substantial relationship to federal funds or programs, whereas in <i>Salinas</i> there were three direct connections between federal funds and the corrupt activity. First, the prisoner paying the bribes was a federal prisoner. Second, the county jail in which the prisoner was housed had been constructed substantially with federal funds. Third, the prisoner was in the jail as part of a federal program in which the county was paid <i>per diem</i> for each federal prisoner it housed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p373\">\n      <span class=\"num\">373</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, to the contrary, Richards, who was the person paying the bribes, had no federal status or connection. Neither the taxis nor the city regulation of the taxi industry was funded by federal funds in any way. Finally, there was no federal program relating to taxi regulation, nor was the integrity of any federally funded program affected by the payment of Lipscomb to vote for certain taxi regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p374\">\n      <span class=\"num\">374</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the connection between federal funds and the prosecuted activity here is nothing like the direct connections between federally funded programs and corrupt activity in <i>Salinas.</i> It is far less substantial than even the most attenuated connections that the Third Circuit imagined might suffice to avoid constitutional questions in <i>Zwick.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20-2\" id=\"fn20-2_ref\">20</a> Under the specific facts of this case, the connection to federal funds is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a conclusion that the &#167; 666 prosecution was necessary and proper to protect federal funding of Love Field or the city generally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21-2\" id=\"fn21-2_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p375\">\n      <span class=\"num\">375</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government alternatively posits that, because the City of Dallas received a sizeable amount of federal funds in real dollars, it was proper for Lipscomb's bribery to be federally prosecuted. The government points out that in 1998, the city accepted over $56 million in federal funds. This, it argues, is a significant amount that warrants the federal prosecution of a local official even for mere local corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p376\">\n      <span class=\"num\">376</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the receipt of this large amount of federal money would make the prosecution of Lipscomb pass muster even under <i>Zwick.</i> This is plainly incorrect. <i>Zwick</i> stated that if \"the greater part of a township's budget came from federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate federal interests.\" <i>Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d at 687 (emphasis added). The city received over $56 million in 1998 &#8212; admittedly a significant amount. Because its 1988 budget was $1.6 billion, however, federal funds made up only 3.5% of the City's budget.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p377\">\n      <span class=\"num\">377</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is nowhere near the example given in <i>Zwick,</i> where a federal interest could arise if the \"greater part of a township's budget\" came from federal funds. Indeed, if federal funding of as little as 3.5% of a city's budget allows prosecution of a city official, then the fact that every state and most cities receive more than $10,000 in federal funds each year is alone enough to allow the federalization of local corruption cases. This cannot be necessary and proper for executing the spending power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>5.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p378\">\n      <span class=\"num\">378</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government further contends that Lipscomb was not just any city employee and that as a city councilman he \"was one of fifteen people responsible for running the City of Dallas.\" The government then argues that high officials, such as Lipscomb, always should be liable for prosecution under &#167; 666, because high officials make decisions on the disposition of both local and federal funds, and therefore dishonesty in the disposition of local funds is a proper cause of worry to the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22-2\" id=\"fn22-2_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p379\">\n      <span class=\"num\">379</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that such prosecution is necessary, because otherwise corrupt officials would be left in place to administer federal funds in the same corrupt fashion that they administer local matters. While this argument has some initial appeal, it ultimately has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p380\">\n      <span class=\"num\">380</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it seems unlikely that, had the state prosecutor been given the fruits of the Lipscomb investigation, he would have declined to prosecute. The charges against Lipscomb were serious, the evidence was compelling, and Lipscomb was a high-profile public servant &#8212; all factors that strongly argue for state prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p381\">\n      <span class=\"num\">381</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if one thinks that states sometimes do not prosecute local crimes where federal prosecutors might do so, it does not follow that allowing double prosecution of local crimes would deter corruption involving federal funds and programs. Instead, allowing the double prosecution of local, but not federal, corruption might tend to cause dishonest local officials to abuse federal dollars rather than local funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p382\">\n      <span class=\"num\">382</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before &#167; 666 was enacted, local embezzlement was covered by local penalties, and federal embezzlement was covered by federal penalties, with only small overlap. Thus, before the advent of &#167; 666, a rational local official would simply weigh the rewards of embezzling local or federal funds against the risk of getting caught and the probable penalty carried by each crime. He then would commit those acts of embezzlement with the best ratio of payoff-to-punishment. Because of the severity of federal penalties, the most rational acts of embezzlement often would be local.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p383\">\n      <span class=\"num\">383</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If &#167; 666 is used to prosecute purely local acts of corruption, however, this calculus changes substantially. Federal acts of corruption still carry the same ratios of reward-to-punishment, but local crimes of corruption now qualify as both federal and local crimes. Thus, federal embezzlement would be more rewarding at the margins than would be local embezzlement. As a result, rather than protecting federal funds and programs, &#167; 666, if applied to purely local crimes, should actually cause an increase in the criminal misuse of federal funds; accordingly, it cannot be said that prosecution of local crimes under &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to carry into execution the spending power, and the application of &#167; 666 to Lipscomb on the facts of this case is, accordingly, unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p384\">\n      <span class=\"num\">384</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel majority errs in deciding the question of venue. The majority teaches that it is better to force the government and defendant to have a biased trial than to inconvenience them with a five-hour drive or a one-hour flight. Because this directly contradicts the plain text of our past precedents, and all common sense, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p385\">\n      <span class=\"num\">385</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The trial court has broad discretion in determining whether a transfer is warranted.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23-2\" id=\"fn23-2_ref\">23</a> \"[A]bsent a showing of illicit motivation, the transfer may be granted within the trial court's discretion unless the defendant shows that a transfer would be prejudicial.\" <i>Osum,</i> 943 F.2d at 1399. Lipscomb makes two attempts to show prejudice; both are meritless. First, Lipscomb asserts that if he had been tried in Dallas, he would have had more blacks in his jury pool, and black jurors would have been more likely to acquit him, a black defendant. Besides the fact that a criminal defendant has no right to jury or venire of \"any particular composition,\" <i>Taylor v. Louisiana,</i> 419 U.S. 522, 538, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975); <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 508 F.2d 388, 395 (5th Cir. 1975), there is a not a hint of an indication that the district court transferred the case to alter the jury pool's racial composition, <i>see United States v. McKinney,</i> 53 F.3d 664, 673 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p386\">\n      <span class=\"num\">386</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb next argues that Amarillo was inconvenient because it \"is 300 miles from Dallas,\" and the \"defendant and all of the witnesses resided in Dallas and every defense attorney practiced there.\" This cannot rise to the necessary level of prejudice. We repeatedly have held that so long as the district court has some \"valid reason for changing venue,\" \"travel and lodging expenses for lawyers and witnesses do not constitute prejudice sufficient to overcome a district court's determination regarding the place of trial.\" <i>United States v. Kaufman,</i> 858 F.2d 994, 1006 (5th Cir.1988). In <i>Kaufman,</i> we held that a district court's concern \"that if it held trial in Austin, then [its] docket in Waco would have to be completely ignored\" constituted such a valid reason and outweighed the \"only minor inconvenience\" of a 102 mile transfer. <i>Kaufman,</i> 858 F.2d at 1006. If docket management constitutes a valid reason for transfer, then surely a court's conviction that it cannot provide a fair trial does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p387\">\n      <span class=\"num\">387</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Directly on point is <i>United States v. Alvarado,</i> 647 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981). We affirmed a <i>sua sponte</i> decision to transfer a case to a venue 231 miles away based on pretrial publicity. We held that the alleged prejudicial effects of \"additional travel and lodging expenses [for the defendants] and their attorneys in addition to the expenses that became necessary in order to subpoena crucial witnesses... do not rise to the level necessary to prove the trial judge abused his discretion by transferring venue so as to avoid an unfair trial from a great deal of publicity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 539.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p388\">\n      <span class=\"num\">388</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority seems to argue that Lipscomb's case is different because 300 miles is really far. But <i>Kaufman</i> makes no allowance for distance within a district. What's more, <i>Kaufman</i> relies on <i>United States v. Fagan,</i> 821 F.2d 1002, 1008 (5th Cir.1987), for its holding. In <i>Fagan,</i> a FED.R.CRIM.P. 21 case, we affirmed the refusal to transfer from the Southern District of Texas to the Eastern District of Louisiana. We noted \"that holding trial in Houston, rather than Louisiana, made it more disruptive to [the defendant], his witnesses, and his attorney\" and may have cost him the representation of a second attorney, but this was not enough to mandate transfer. <i>Id.</i> at 1008. If the 348-mile distance in <i>Fagan</i> was not prejudicial as a matter of law, then the 300 mile distance in this case certainly is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p389\">\n      <span class=\"num\">389</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today's holding has the potential to inject great uncertainty into the trial process and actually to increase the number of unfair trials. Luckily, future district courts will not be bound by it. The majority's venue ruling plainly contradicts <i>Alvarado,</i> and it is well established that \"[w]hen two panel opinions appear in conflict, it is the earlier which controls.\" <i>Harvey v. Blake,</i> 913 F.2d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1990). But, the fact that today's holding will not be binding does not make it any less in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p390\">\n      <span class=\"num\">390</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> U.S. CONST.

The <i>Dole</i> Court cited <i>Oklahoma</i> as an example of the federal government's conditioning receipt of federal funds on compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative objectives. <i>Dole,</i> 483 U.S. at 206-07, 107 S.Ct. 2793.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> But see<i>United States v.

The <i>McCormack</i> court argued further that &#167; 666 sets out federal requirements for recipient governments and prescribes negative consequences if those requirements are not followed. I disagree. A mere grant of money cannot be called a condition, and <i>Dole</i> requires not just a condition, but an explicitly stated condition.

The only relationship the government can manage to muster between Lipscomb's violation of state criminal law and federal spending is that Yellow Cab's taxis sometimes go to a city airport that receives federal dollars for improvements.

This result raises significant federalism concerns, turning traditionally local conduct into a matter for federal enforcement involving a substantial extension of federal law enforcement resources.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-2_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> For instance, the government may provide funds to put more local police officers on the streets or may reform federal welfare spending in an effort to create incentives for families to stay together</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-2_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Using this reasoning, the government could as easily argue that under the Commerce Clause, conduct may be criminalized wherever it is committed by one who participates in interstate commerce, rather than only where there is some link between the conduct and interstate commerce. In fact, this reasoning would allow federal police power under numerous clauses of the Constitution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20-2_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The \"highly attenuated implication of a federal interest\" that<i>Zwick</i> imagined would provide a \"sufficient federal connection\" to satisfy the requirements of &#167; 666 was a far less attenuated federal interest than is the one the government asserts here. The <i>Zwick</i> court</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">conceive[d] of several ways in which the government could prove a federal interest in &#167; 666.... If, for example, in a given year, the greater part of a township's budget came from federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate federal interests. Absent that situation, the offense conduct would have to somehow implicate a particular substantive federal interest, as the Supreme Court found it did in <i>Salinas,</i> where federal funds were being provided to house federal prisoners in local prisons.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d at 687. The court cited further examples, including <i>Santopietro,</i> holding that bribes paid by real estate developers in search of development contracts with city agencies that were overseeing HUD programs met the federal nexus requirement of &#167; 666. <i>Zwick</i> also cited <i>Frega,</i> in which a district court concluded that bribery of state judges did not meet the requisite federal interest, but hypothesized that a sufficient federal connection could exist in different circumstances, such as if the state courts received federal funds for the purpose of appointing habeas counsel and the bribes paid affected the appointment of particular habeas counsel. <i>Id.</i> at 687-88.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although these indeed are examples of federal connections that are somewhat attenuated, nevertheless the federal interest in each example is plain, as is the necessity of protecting it against corruption so that Congress may properly execute its spending power, free of the danger that federally funded programs will be corrupted and perverted. The same cannot be said of Lipscomb's prosecution, for no federal program was, in any way, affected by his corruption.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21-2_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Moreover, this<i>post hoc</i> argument &#8212; that the integrity of federal funding at the airport was endangered by Lipscomb's taxicab corruption &#8212; was never charged in the indictment or argued to the jury. Instead, the jury instructions merely stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is also not necessary that the $10,000 in federal assistance be directly involved in or traced to the allegedly corrupt acts charged in the Indictment.

FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Lipscomb's conduct and particular jurisdictional facts are important to the varying views of the members of this panel. We therefore recount them in considerable detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Lipscomb's Offense Conduct</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb served on the Dallas City Council (the \"Council\") from 1984 to 1993 and again from 1995 until 2000. During his first period of service, Lipscomb vigorously opposed any measure favorable to taxicab companies, including Yellow Cab and Checker Cab (together, \"Yellow Cab\"), both owned by his co-conspirator, Floyd Richards. Lipscomb's animus against cab companies apparently was grounded in a belief that cab companies perennially failed to serve the minority community adequately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his second period of service on the Council, however, Lipscomb demonstrated a considerably kinder disposition toward cab companies, especially Yellow Cab. In 1994, during Lipscomb's hiatus from the Council, Richards asked Lipscomb to help improve Yellow Cab's reputation in the minority community and offered to pay Lipscomb $1,000 a month in cash for that help. Lipscomb assented to this proposal. Richards and Lipscomb agreed to continue this arrangement as long as it was mutually agreeable. All this transpired orally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richards continued to make the monthly payments to Lipscomb after he was re-elected to the Council. At times, Richards would receive phone calls from Lipscomb indicating that he needed a payment, after which Lipscomb would visit Yellow Cab's office and receive cash that Richards took from the company safe. Sometimes during these meetings, Richards and Lipscomb would discuss taxicab issues then pending before the Council. The government alleged that in addition to making these monthly payments to Lipscomb, Richards gave Lipscomb free use of cars, free cellular telephone service, and free cab rides worth more than $3,300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Lipscomb ran again, his advisers heard Richards declare that he was willing to spend up to $30,000 to get Lipscomb elected. When Richards learned that corporations could not contribute to campaigns and that individuals could contribute no more than $1,000, however, he decided to \"lend\" $20,500 to a business owned by Lipscomb's daughter and son-in-law. That money was intended by all concerned to help fund Lipscomb's campaign, and it did so; but Lipscomb did not report the campaign \"loan\" or any of the payments in his campaign finance reports or his personal financial statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richards testified that although he never made the quid pro quo explicit, he expected that, in return for the monthly payments and the campaign funding, Lipscomb would cast votes favorable to Yellow Cab. Richards testified further that he and Lipscomb had an understanding, and that Richards was satisfied that Lipscomb knew that the payments would stop if he voted the wrong way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb's support of Yellow Cab went far beyond the casting of favorable votes at meetings of the Council. Over time, he and Richards discussed each of the taxicab issues on which Lipscomb allegedly was influenced by this bribery: (1) operating authority and fleet increases, (2) location of dispatch offices, (3) age limits and inspections, and (4) insurance ratings. Lipscomb had opposed Yellow Cab on these issues before 1994, but when he returned to the Council, he supported that company vigorously and often.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in 1994 Lipscomb, as a private citizen, had spoken out against authority for Yellow Cab and two other cab companies to operate in Dallas. Once he returned to the council, though, he supported Yellow Cab's requests for increases in the size of its cab fleets. Yet when cab companies unaffiliated with Richards sought authority to operate in Dallas, Lipscomb urged that their applications be removed from the council's agenda. When another cab company's request for operating authority was taken up by the council, Lipscomb tried to require a voice vote on the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yellow Cab also needed relief from a city ordinance requiring cab companies to maintain their dispatch offices inside the Dallas city limits. After a city staffer learned that Yellow Cab was violating this policy, she sought to enforce it, but the Council referred the matter to its Transportation Committee. Even though Lipscomb did not serve on that committee, he attended its meeting and browbeat the staffer, going so far as to ask her when she would retire. Eventually, with Lipscomb's encouragement, the Council permitted cab companies to operate dispatch offices in the Dallas suburbs, thus legitimating Yellow Cab's office, the only one in violation, in which Yellow Cab had invested $15,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Yellow Cab had the newest fleet among the cab companies serving Dallas, the City was encouraged by Yellow Cab energetically to enforce against its competitors the City's age limit on vehicles for hire and its requirement that they be inspected. In 1992, Lipscomb had favored relaxing both rules, but in 1996, after he was told by Richards that he wanted stricter enforcement, Lipscomb began to support age limits on sedan-style limousines similar to the limits that applied to taxicabs. He also sought to remove older shuttles and limousines from service more quickly, and he opposed the Council's effort to revisit its earlier vote &#8212; favorable to Yellow Cab &#8212; to approve stricter age limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb also acted on Yellow Cab's behalf with respect to insurance issues. Yellow Cab lobbied the Council to require that the insurance coverage mandated for taxis be written by insurers with favorable financial ratings. This proposal proved to be controversial: The City's Director of Human Services, whose department handled insurance matters, was concerned that a rating requirement might favor large firms and exclude small businesses owned by minorities or women. Lipscomb nevertheless sought to put the rating requirement on the Council's agenda, and both seconded and voted for a motion to increase the minimum rating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Lipscomb energetically used many of the tools at the disposal of a Council member &#8212; his vote, his oversight authority, his agenda-setting power, and his other parliamentary privileges &#8212; to support policies favorable to Yellow Cab, even though these policies conflicted with his previous positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Jurisdictional Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Lipscomb's second period of council service, the City, through many of its agencies and departments, received substantial federal funds. In the year ending in September 1996, Dallas received $44.3 million and spent $48.1 million in federal financial assistance which funded a wide range of joint priorities: community development, farmer's market infrastructure, emergency shelter, housing, community policing, airport and freeway improvements, arts development, pollution control, emergency management, interlibrary cooperation, child immunization, homeless health care, and substance abuse control, among others. Federal support in 1996 dwarfed state support, which totaled only $3.7 million received and $3.1 million spent. Other years were similar: in 1997, the city received $54.3 million and spent $53.3 million in federal funds, but received only $3.0 million and spent $3.8 million in state funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony of the city's chief financial officer showed that in Dallas's efforts to obtain and then allocate federal funds, the Council played an integral role:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And once the City gets the Department of Housing money or grant funds, does the City then disburse those funds?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, we do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And is the disbursement by approval of a City Councilmember or the City Council at large?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. If the individual expenditure is greater than $50,000, or $15,000 in the case of professional services, it would come back to the Council for approval of that specific contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And does that frequently happen?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, uh-huh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. All right. And, in fact, does the Council have to approve, vote for and approve the application to HUD and the other agencies of the federal government to get federal money?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes. They vote for the application and the acceptance of the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council as a whole thus controlled &#8212; and individual council members influenced &#8212; the City's applications for, and receipt and expenditure of, at least forty million federal dollars each year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government secured a lengthy indictment against Lipscomb. Counts 2 through 33 charged him with specific substantive bribery violations of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) and charged Richards with aiding and abetting those offenses. Conversely, counts 34 through 65 charged Richards with bribery violations of &#167; 666(a)(2) and charged Lipscomb with aiding and abetting. Count 1 charged Lipscomb with conspiring to violate &#167; 666. Notably, the government did not charge Lipscomb with the misuse of state or federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks before the long-scheduled trial date, the district court, acting <i>sua sponte,</i> without giving notice to the parties or holding a hearing, and over Lipscomb's strenuous objections, transferred the trial from the Dallas Division of the Northern District of Texas to the Amarillo Division. Thereafter, Richards entered into a plea agreement which, among other things, required him to testify at trial. The jury convicted Lipscomb on all counts. The district court sentenced him to 41 months' imprisonment, imposed a $7,500 fine, and ordered him to pay a $6,500 special assessment. The court also directed that the sentence be served under home confinement because of Lipscomb's failing health and advanced age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb appeals his conviction on several grounds. The government cross-appeals the home-confinement aspect of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Lipscomb's Challenge to the Jurisdictional Reach of &#167; 666</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it stood at the time and now stands, &#167; 666 contains two monetary thresholds. Section 666 reads, in principal part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>&#167; 666.

He proposes that we construe the statute to require a nexus between his offense conduct and federal funds &#8212; or, put differently, that his conduct implicate a tangible federal interest. He also contends that, when so construed, the statute does not reach his conduct. Neither contention succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phylogeny of &#167; 666 jurisprudence does reflect a growing tension between two possible focuses of the statute. One, which another court has dubbed the \"funds focus,\" would concentrate on deterring direct depletion of federal funds; the other, the so-called \"corruption focus,\" would combat \"the corrupting, public-trust eroding effects of bribery\" and would not require that federal funds be depleted or misallocated as a direct result of the bribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Lipscomb's proposal that we adopt the narrower, funds focus, however, would require us to ignore our consistently broad interpretation of &#167; 666 as targeting corruption <i>qua</i> corruption. Furthermore, even if we were to read &#167; 666 and our cases to construe it narrowly, to superimpose a nexus element, we would still conclude that there is a sufficient linkage between Lipscomb's conduct and federal funds to support jurisdiction of Lipscomb's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Westmoreland.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The defendant, Westmoreland, was a county supervisor who was convicted of accepting bribes and kickbacks in connection with the purchasing of supplies for the county's highway construction projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The county received slightly more than $200,000 in total federal revenue-sharing funds, of which roughly 15% was allocated to Westmoreland's district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Westmoreland contended that \"the federal revenue sharing funds received [by her district] ... were segregated and not expended for the types of purchases she made.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> She therefore argued that the bribery \"concerned only state monies and did not fall within the purview of the statute.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We rejected such a construction as contrary to the statute's text:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Westmoreland's protestations, we find the relevant statutory language plain and unambiguous. By the terms of section 666, when a local government agency receives an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a federal assistance program, its agents are governed by the statute, and an agent violates subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct \"in <i>any</i> transaction or matter or series of transactions or matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the affairs of\" the local government agency. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(b) (Supp. 1984) (emphasis added). Subsection (b) contains nothing to indicate that \"any transaction involving $5,000\" means \"any federally funded transaction involving $5,000\" or \"any transaction involving $5,000 of federal funds[.]\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Westmoreland also made the argument that Lipscomb makes here: \"[A]n expansive interpretation [of &#167; 666] ... extends federal power in a manner that, in many instances, the federal interest at stake does not warrant.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The <i>Westmoreland</i> panel responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Congress has spoken, however, we do not sit to judge the wisdom of its action. It is sufficient that Congress seeks to preserve the integrity of federal funds by assuring the integrity of the organizations or agencies that receive them.... [T]he direct involvement of federal funds in a transaction is not an essential element of bribery under section 666(b); the government need not prove that federal monies funded a corrupt transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Westmoreland</i> thus held that no connection was required between the federal funds allocated to the county and the supervisor's illegal conduct. Instead, the only requisite involvement of federal funds was the county's receipt of more than $10,000 per year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Westmoreland,</i> we have sometimes applied its broad reading of &#167; 666 unconditionally. For example, in <i>United States v. Moeller,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> the government appealed the dismissal of &#167; 666 counts against employees of the Texas Federal Inspection Service (\"TFIS\"), a cooperative venture of the agriculture departments of Texas and the United States, in which state workers were empowered to conduct federal inspections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Although we said that \"there must be some nexus between the <i>criminal conduct</i> and the <i>agency</i> receiving federal assistance,\" that nexus was purely textual: It was present when the Texas Department of Agriculture, a government agency for purposes of &#167; 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal funds, and the defendants, TFIS employees, were agents of that federally-funded agency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Thus <i>Moeller</i> cannot be read to have imposed the extratextual nexus that Lipscomb urges us to engraft on &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some uncertainty seeped into our &#167; 666 jurisprudence as a result of <i>United States v.

And <i>that relationship is close enough to satisfy whatever connection the statute might require.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the Court disposed of any constitutional question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here is no serious doubt about the constitutionality of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of this case. [The briber] was without question a prisoner held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of agreements with the Federal Government. The preferential treatment accorded to him was a <i>threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program.</i> Whatever might be said about &#167; 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in other cases, the application of &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Salinas,</i> the Supreme Court has decided only one more &#167; 666 case: <i>Fischer v. United States,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> which also sent mixed messages. Echoing <i>Salinas,</i> the <i>Fischer</i> Court described &#167; 666 as \"expansive, both as to the conduct forbidden and the entities covered\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> and read the statute to reveal Congress's \"expansive, unambiguous <i>intent to ensure the integrity</i> of organizations participating in federal assistance programs\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> &#8212; clearly embracing the \"corruption focus.\" The Court therefore affirmed the conviction of a defendant who had defrauded a municipal hospital authority that participated in the federal Medicare program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> In so doing, however, the Court once again mentioned in passing a conceivable constitutional problem: To read the statutory term \"benefits\" too broadly, the Court cautioned, so as to mean \"[a]ny receipt of federal funds,\" could \"turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense, upsetting the proper federal balance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Justice Thomas, joined in dissent by Justice Scalia, likewise warned that \"[w]ithout a jurisdictional provision that would ensure that in <i>each</i> case the exercise of federal power is related to the federal interest in a federal program, &#167; 666 would criminalize routine acts of fraud or bribery\" and threaten principles of federalism.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Salinas</i> and <i>Fischer</i> did not unconditionally validate our view that once a local government accepts more than $10,000 per year from the federal government, no further federal interest is needed to justify prosecution under &#167; 666, neither did either of those cases condemn our broad approach. The <i>Salinas</i> Court merely observed in passing that, even if a federal interest were required, such an interest clearly existed in preventing federal prisoners from bribing local jail officials participating in a federal incarceration program. Similarly, the <i>Fischer</i> Court construed a term in &#167; 666 broadly, simply musing that federalism principles might somehow limit the statute's sweep. As either a statutory or constitutional matter, then, the Court might be seen as harboring inchoate qualms about whether, for &#167; 666 to apply, there might be some need for a direct interest in the funds involved in the prohibited conduct (or, alternatively, a need for either a nexus between the federal dollars and the offense conduct or an extra-textual jurisdictional element to &#167; 666). Lipscomb argues this inference forcefully, noting that <i>Salinas</i> left open the question whether &#167; 666 \"requires some other kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of federal funds.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> He urges us to overlook <i>Westmoreland</i> and answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, of course, we could not do even if we were so inclined. Mere ruminations in Supreme Court opinions do not empower a subsequent panel of our court to disregard, much less overrule, the holding of a prior panel. And, as we noted just last year, \"[w]e are not convinced that <i>Salinas</i> wrought a change upon our earlier precedents.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Because <i>Salinas</i> and <i>Fischer</i> went no further than to advert in <i>dicta</i> to the mere possibility that the argument now advanced by Lipscomb might someday be favored, we are bound to adhere to <i>Westmoreland</i>'s statutory holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, our post-<i>Salinas</i> decisions interpreting &#167; 666 must be read as adhering to this rule. Nevertheless, the cautionary words in <i>Salinas</i> and <i>Fischer,</i> combined with our prior opinions' silence on the constitutional question, divided the next panel of this court to interpret &#167; 666. The panel majority in <i>United States v. Phillips</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> reiterated <i>Moeller</i>'s requirement of a nexus between the misconduct and the agency (as distinct from a nexus between the misconduct and the federal funds themselves),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> but added some extra-textual teeth in holding that defendant Phillips, a tax assessor, was not an \"agent\" of Louisiana's St. Helena Parish, which received over $10,000 in federal funds, so as to be liable himself under &#167; 666 for putting on his payroll a political ally who then did no work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> The panel instead viewed Phillips as an agent of the Louisiana Tax Commission, which received no federal funds, and concluded that the statute did not reach his activity. Underlying this definitional question about \"agent,\" however, lurked the majority's concern that the defendant was too functionally distant from the flow of federal funds to the parish:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Salinas</i> that the funds in question need not be purely federal, nor must the conduct in question have a direct effect on federal funds. The statute possibly can reach misuse of virtually all funds of an agency that administers the federal program in question. It is a different matter altogether, however, to suggest that the statute can reach any government employee who misappropriates purely local funds, <i>without regard to how organizationally removed the employee is from the particular agency that administers the federal program.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that it is at least arguable, albeit tenuously, that this \"organizationally removed\" language conflicts with <i>Westmoreland</i> and <i>Moeller,</i> even though the <i>Phillips</i> majority purported to distinguish those two cases factually, and the <i>Phillips</i> panel may be perceived as having favored the \"funds focus\" for &#167; 666. To the extent that there is a conflict, however, the older case controls, as the <i>Phillips</i> dissenter correctly noted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only by interpreting \"agent\" narrowly was the <i>Phillips</i> majority able to avoid the constitutional question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> The <i>Phillips</i> dissent read our own precedents as rejecting any nexus requirement whatsoever and took issue with the panel majority's narrow definition of \"agent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> The dissent asserted that a \"specific nexus &#8212; between Phillips and the federal funds inside Parish coffers &#8212; is not required\" and furthermore that \"it is sufficient that the criminal conduct affect the agency receiving federal assistance: in essence, we have determined that there is an inherent federal interest in insuring that agencies receiving significant amounts of federal funding are not corrupt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> In a nutshell, this is precisely the \"corruption focus\" that we had firmly adopted in <i>Westmoreland,</i> a focus that has never been overruled either by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

These cases provide additional support for the proposition that &#167; 666 easily reaches Lipscomb's conduct. In <i>United States v. Reyes,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> we affirmed the &#167; 666 conviction of city council members who had been bribed to vote in favor of awarding a municipal construction project to a particular contractor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> The government noted that a federal loan would have supported the project had it gone forward, but we explicitly declined to rely on that fact, stating instead that federal support of the three city departments involved in the project &#8212; the finance, housing, and legal departments &#8212; justified prosecuting under &#167; 666:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying <i>Westmoreland</i> and <i>Moeller</i>..., we conclude that the connection between federal benefits and the charged conduct is sufficient to uphold Reyes's convictions under &#167; 666.... Like the county supervisor in <i>Westmoreland</i> and the senior agency officials in <i>Moeller,</i> here <i>the charged criminal conduct related to city council members, who, by voting up or down on bids, ultimately decide how federal money will be spent.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an analysis firmly supports Lipscomb's susceptibility to conviction under &#167; 666: In Dallas, federal money supports the City's transportation and human services departments &#8212; the very agencies of city government that Lipscomb sought corruptly to influence. <i>Reyes</i> reaffirms, as a statutory matter, that whatever nexus &#167; 666 requires &#8212; if any &#8212; is present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, we decided <i>United States v. Williams</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> without discussing any jurisdictional element or nexus requirement at all &#8212; despite the fact that if there had been a jurisdictional flaw, it would have been incumbent on the <i>Williams</i> panel to address that problem, even <i>sua sponte. Williams</i> involved facts virtually identical to those present in <i>Reyes,</i> in <i>Westmoreland,</i> and here. Williams, a former member of the Jackson, Mississippi City Council, was convicted under &#167; 666 of aiding and abetting the solicitation and acceptance of bribes &#8212; specifically, $150,000 in exchange for a re-vote on a cable television license contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> The <i>Williams</i> court did not describe any direct federal fiscal interest at stake in that re-vote. Such questions, however, may not have been briefed or argued in <i>Williams,</i> as the opinion in that case expressly rejected only other challenges &#8212; those grounded in equal protection, due process, and sufficiency and admissibility of the evidence &#8212; to Williams's conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> Taken in isolation, <i>Williams</i> has little if any precedential value on the nexus issue, one way or the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But of course <i>Williams</i> does not stand alone. It is merely the most recent in a series of our opinions &#8212; <i>Westmoreland, Moeller, Marmolejo, Reyes,</i> and <i>Williams</i> &#8212; that have consistently applied the broad \"corruption focus\" of &#167; 666. The <i>Phillips</i> panel did construe the term \"agent\" to avoid the constitutional question, but we cannot do that here: As a textual matter, the term \"agent\" plainly includes city council members. <i>Westmoreland</i> applied &#167; 666 to a county supervisor; <i>Reyes</i> and <i>Williams</i> both applied it to city council members. Hence <i>Westmoreland</i>'s view of &#167; 666 continues to be the law in this circuit and to preclude a more narrow construction of the statute. Even though we get to the question from different jurisdictional perspectives, Judge Duh&#233; and I are in complete accord on the result for Lipscomb of the foregoing analysis of &#167; 666: He was subject to being tried in federal district court for violating that statute, and he was subject to being convicted by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>IV. DID LIPSCOMB RAISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the constitutional problem that Lipscomb's statutory-construction argument presages (and writing for myself alone, although supplementing Judge Smith's analysis), I must make three observations on our intrapanel disagreement over whether the constitutional issue is properly before us. To me, this debate: (1) is more semantical than substantive, (2) is in tension with controlling Supreme Court precedent, and (3) overlooks the real nature of the constitutional question at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Semantics first: As the Supreme Court recently said, \"jurisdiction ... is a word of many, too many, meanings.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a> This imprecision is one source of our panel's split here. Judge Duh&#233; reads \"jurisdiction\" in the pleadings, briefs, and record to mean <i>adjudicative</i> jurisdiction only &#8212; the authority of federal courts to hear only those categories of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) authorized by Congress, between those categories of persons (personal jurisdiction) permitted by the Constitution. But in the context of the expressly constitutional arguments that Lipscomb sometimes makes, Judge Smith and I read his use of \"jurisdiction\" &#8212; at least on those occasions &#8212; to mean <i>legislative</i> jurisdiction, the \"authority\" of Congress \"to make its law applicable to particular persons or activities.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb also uses the ambiguous phrase \"federal jurisdiction,\" which could be either adjudicative or legislative. That ambiguity is not only terminological, but also conceptual. To state the obvious, legislative jurisdiction flows <i>from</i> the Constitution <i>to</i> the Congress and limits, in today's context, the subject matter and the classes of persons that Congress may regulate by statute. In contrast, adjudicative jurisdiction generally flows <i>from</i> Congress <i>to</i> the courts as grants of subject-matter jurisdiction, grants made by Congress in enacting laws pursuant to its power to constitute inferior federal courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> In the instant context, the judicial power extends constitutionally to cases arising under federal criminal laws. Consequently, a court's <i>adjudicative</i> jurisdiction to convict a defendant of a federal crime cannot exist in the absence of Congress's <i>legislative</i> jurisdiction to criminalize the particular conduct of which the particular defendant is accused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reach of Congress's legislative jurisdiction, of course, is sometimes bounded by structural constitutional provisions. For example, grants of jurisdiction are limited by the Necessary and Proper Clause, which covers laws that \"carry into Execution ... all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States or in any Department or Officer thereof.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> I cannot even imagine how it could be \"necessary and proper\" to the exercise of either the judicial power or the power to constitute inferior courts for us to have <i>adjudicative</i> jurisdiction over a case implicating a statute that Congress lacked the <i>legislative</i> jurisdiction to enact. It should go without saying, therefore, that our subject-matter jurisdiction has constitutional as well as statutory limits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a>: It involves \"the courts' statutory <i>or constitutional</i> power to adjudicate the case.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To repeat, then: A federal forum simply must lack adjudicative jurisdiction to hear a case based on a federal statute that Congress lacked the legislative jurisdiction (translation: constitutional power or authority) to apply to the situation in question. If I am correct in my position that this case implicates our constitutional duty, at every level and at every stage of the proceedings, to ensure the existence of our adjudicative jurisdiction, then that duty trumps the canon of constitutional avoidance that Justice Brandeis discussed in <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a> a canon that on other occasions I have dutifully obeyed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> At the risk of exposing my own intellectual shortcomings, then, I confess that neither semantically nor substantively can I understand the distinction, which Judge Duh&#233; detects in Lipscomb's pleadings and briefs, between adjudicative, subject-matter jurisdiction and legislative jurisdiction (<i>structural</i> constitutionality)&#8212;a distinction that is clear to Judge Duh&#233; but in this case remains blurred to me. If a successful as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of &#167; 666 would limit Congress's legislative jurisdiction, i.e., would identify someone or some act beyond Congress's authority, it cannot help but limit our adjudicative jurisdiction to the same degree. In this sense, because Lipscomb appears to raise a structural jurisdictional challenge, I question whether his is the kind of constitutional argument that may be waived through delay or disuse; if it \"involves a court's power to hear a case, [it] can never be forfeited or waived.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I read them, Lipscomb's pleadings and briefs do raise &#8212; and thus do not waive &#8212; the constitutional issue. Rather, they question both Congress's legislative jurisdiction (constitutional authority) to enact &#167; 666 and our adjudicative power to apply &#167; 666 here. Lipscomb has raised a classic challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction: He \"argues that the extension of federal jurisdiction over acts such as [his] would exceed the power of Congress.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My belief that we should consider this argument finds support in <i>Salinas</i> itself. There the Supreme Court easily undertook to determine whether &#167; 666 was constitutional, and squarely held that it was, as applied,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> despite the fact that neither we nor the district court had addressed the statute's constitutionality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a> In support of its \"holding,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a> the Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[s]tatutes should be construed to avoid constitutional questions, but this interpretative canon is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.

Starting with these two premises, I cannot avoid the conclusion that Lipscomb did raise the constitutional flaw. By construing the statute as all three of us do, we are sailing into the very waters that Lipscomb warned us were constitutionally uncharted. I knowingly and willfully proceed to endeavor to chart them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">AS-APPLIED CONSTITUTIONALITY UNDER <i>DOLE</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the constitutionality of a federal statute <i>de novo.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> My solo review here will focus on whether &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to the spending power, but the proper foundation for that analysis is a review of the Supreme Court's spending-clause jurisprudence.

Even if &#167; 666 is not a conditional-grant statute &#8212; a conclusion of which I am less certain than is Judge Smith &#8212; the conditional-grant cases establish both that \"internal limits on congressional spending power are difficult to discern\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> and that, to whatever extent the Tenth Amendment is an external limit on the spending power, that Amendment does <i>not</i> function as \"a prohibition on the indirect achievement of objectives which Congress is not empowered to achieve directly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> The Tenth Amendment thus is not as great an obstacle to the necessity and propriety of &#167; 666 as Judge Smith believes it to be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Conditional-Grant Precedents</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress likely enacted &#167; 666 pursuant to the Spending Clause of the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a> Under that clause, it is settled, Congress may regulate the states by conditioning grants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> Cases on such conditions have established that the structural limits on federal power that often arise in the commerce-clause context do not operate with the same force against conditional-grant provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

First, like Judge Smith, two district courts have concluded that &#167; 666 is not a conditional-grant statute at all, because it does not require the state (here, Texas) or its political subdivision (here, Dallas) to do anything.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn82\" id=\"fn82_ref\">82</a> As the court in <i>United States v. Cantor</i> noted, &#167; 666 \"does not impose a condition on the receipt of federal funds. The statute neither requires a state's compliance with federal ... directives nor prevents state action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn83\" id=\"fn83_ref\">83</a> Like the <i>Cantor</i> court, however, I believe that this lack of direct effect on states and localities actually supports the statute's constitutionality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn84\" id=\"fn84_ref\">84</a> Furthermore, the Supreme Court has not held that, for a statute to be a conditional-grant provision and stand or fall under a <i>Dole</i> analysis, the statute must require states or localities either to take or to refrain from taking any action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn85\" id=\"fn85_ref\">85</a> <i>Dole</i> may describe Congress's spending power generally, not just its power to condition grants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, &#167; 666 is a freestanding ban: It neither grants any funds nor takes part in a broader funding statute. This fact has prompted the objection that its criminal sanction cannot be a condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn86\" id=\"fn86_ref\">86</a> Although superficially appealing, this argument elevates form too highly over substance. The anticorruption principle in &#167; 666 applies equally to every federal dollar granted, and &#167; 666 logically cuts across all federal grants to states and localities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn87\" id=\"fn87_ref\">87</a> To require Congress to insert a mini-&#167; 666 into every chapter of the United States Code that authorizes intergovernmental financial assistance would constitute excessive scrupulosity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, several judges have objected that Congress's spending power cannot include the power to criminalize conduct by third parties, and that <i>Dole</i> therefore cannot apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn88\" id=\"fn88_ref\">88</a> (This argument begs the broader question, which I address below, whether &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to the spending power.) Many courts, including this one in <i>Phillips,</i> have nevertheless interpreted &#167; 666 using <i>Dole</i>'s factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn89\" id=\"fn89_ref\">89</a> Therefore, although we may debate whether the &#167; 666 peg fits the conditional-grant hole, I shall test it under the four prongs of <i>Dole.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The</i> Dole <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dole</i> first requires that \"exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of the general welfare.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn90\" id=\"fn90_ref\">90</a> In assessing whether this is so, <i>Dole</i> cautions, \"courts should defer substantially to the judgment of Congress.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn91\" id=\"fn91_ref\">91</a> Congress has stated that the purpose of &#167; 666 is to \"protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn92\" id=\"fn92_ref\">92</a> Mindful of the deference due this judgment, I accept that Congress easily could have thought that &#167; 666 advanced the general welfare by protecting the federal fisc and by ensuring that state and local decisions regarding federal programs are not made by corrupt officials. I do not doubt, then, that Congress enacted &#167; 666 \"in pursuit of the general welfare.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Dole</i> warns that \"if Congress desires to condition the States' receipt of federal funds, it must do so unambiguously..., enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn93\" id=\"fn93_ref\">93</a> Even though &#167; 666 does not require the states to act, it does make state and local government officers criminally liable for specific misdeeds. Thus the states arguably have a dignity interest at stake, and if so, they have a right to know the threat to that interest that &#167; 666 would pose &#8212; and the language of &#167; 666, which is anything but ambiguous, surely lets them know. To the extent that &#167; 666 is a conditional-grant statute, both the grant (of $10,000 or more in federal funds) and the condition (criminalizing official bribery and theft) are pellucid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn94\" id=\"fn94_ref\">94</a> I see little danger that a state or locality that receives federal funds could mistake the potential of &#167; 666 to criminalize conduct by its officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Dole</i> mandates that conditions on federal spending be related \"to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn95\" id=\"fn95_ref\">95</a> or that conditions \"bear some relationship to the federal spending.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn96\" id=\"fn96_ref\">96</a> \"The required degree of this relationship is one of reasonableness or minimum rationality.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn97\" id=\"fn97_ref\">97</a> It suffices here to observe that many courts have held that &#167; 666 is reasonably related to the federal interest in safeguarding federal dollars from control of dishonest administrators, and that &#167; 666 therefore passes spending-power muster. At least one court has so concluded when the offense conduct did not involve federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn98\" id=\"fn98_ref\">98</a> Some of the other decisions arriving at this conclusion, however, may have dismissed facial, rather than as-applied, challenges to the statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn99\" id=\"fn99_ref\">99</a>; and other cases have affirmed convictions for conduct that implicated federal funds more directly than did Lipscomb's actions here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn100\" id=\"fn100_ref\">100</a> Because <i>Dole</i>'s relatedness inquiry merges with my analysis of whether applying &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to the spending power, I discuss both questions together in detail below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, in <i>Dole</i>'s final prong, the Court cautioned that \"other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fn101_ref\">101</a> Yet the Court then reiterated its <i>Oklahoma</i> holding that \"<i>a perceived Tenth Amendment limitation on congressional regulation of state affairs did not concomitantly limit the range of conditions legitimately placed on federal grants.</i>\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn102\" id=\"fn102_ref\">102</a> Rather, the \"independent bar\" simply means that Congress may not use its spending power \"to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn103\" id=\"fn103_ref\">103</a> In this case, no action by Texas or Dallas is alleged to be unconstitutional, so the fourth <i>Dole</i> prong is plainly not at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, to the extent that <i>Dole</i> controls whether &#167; 666 can apply here, the only problem lies in the third part of the <i>Dole</i> test: reasonable relationship to a federal interest. Because this reasonably-related prong of <i>Dole</i> is a specific application of the more general test for whether an act of Congress is necessary and proper to an enumerated power,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn104\" id=\"fn104_ref\">104</a> I treat these questions together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">AS-APPLIED CONSTITUTIONALITY UNDER <i>McCULLOCH</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to assigning Congress the spending power, which brings with it the power to condition grants, the Constitution also gives Congress the power \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be <i>necessary and proper</i> for carrying into Execution\" the powers expressly delegated to the federal government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn105\" id=\"fn105_ref\">105</a> Prosecuting Lipscomb under &#167; 666 is therefore constitutional if &#167; 666 is \"necessary and proper\" to Congress's spending power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

To the <i>McCulloch</i> Court, this example demonstrated that \"necessary\" has a range of meanings, including \"needful, requisite, essential, or conducive to.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn111\" id=\"fn111_ref\">111</a> It was through the lens of this broad construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause that Marshall saw justification for Congress's creation of the national bank, the power to create which is nowhere enumerated in Article I. Whether that broad construction justifies applying &#167; 666 here depends on Congress's intent in enacting the statute, as well as on the nature of the federal interest embodied in this case and the relationship between that interest and Lipscomb's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Legislative History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">History often tells us why Congress deemed a statute necessary and proper.

The relevant passage is titled \"Part C &#8212; Program Fraud and Bribery,\" and states that &#167; 666</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">is designed to create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery <i>involving Federal monies</i> that are disbursed to private organizations or State and local governments <i>pursuant to a Federal program.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn120\" id=\"fn120_ref\">120</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report notes, however, that under the prior law banning theft of federal property, prosecuting was often impossible</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because title has passed to the recipient [government] before the property is stolen, or the funds are so commingled that the Federal character of the funds cannot be shown. This gives rise to a serious gap in the law, since even though title to the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such program funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn121\" id=\"fn121_ref\">121</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the report's emphasis on program funds would support a narrow reading of the necessity and propriety of &#167; 666, its emphasis on commingling supports a broad one. In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee's most explicit direction actually suggests that the Committee intended to limit the scope of &#167; 666, but in a way that still would cover Lipscomb-like conduct:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee intends that the term \"Federal program involving a grant, a contract, a subsidy, a loan, a guarantee, insurance, or another form of Federal assistance\" be construed broadly, consistent with the <i>purpose of this section to protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from</i> theft, fraud, and <i>undue influence by bribery.</i> However, the concept is not unlimited. The term \"Federal program\" means that there must exist a specific statutory scheme authorizing the Federal assistance in order to promote and achieve certain policy objectives. Thus, not every Federal contract or disbursement of funds would be covered. For example, if a government agency lawfully purchases more than $10,000 in equipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this section to make a theft of $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn122\" id=\"fn122_ref\">122</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus one of the two lines that the Senate Judiciary Committee expressly drew &#8212; to exclude theft from a supplier from the coverage of &#167; 666 &#8212; would not exclude Lipscomb's conduct, quintessentially \"undue influence by bribery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>The Specified Cases</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immediate next sentence in the report, subject to much exegesis by Judge Smith, states: \"It is, however, the intent [`of this section'] to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the types involved in the <i>Del Toro, Hinton,</i> and <i>Mosley</i> cases.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn123\" id=\"fn123_ref\">123</a> With continued due respect to Judge Smith, I do not discern in this sentence any clear direction to us. Both <i>Hinton</i> and <i>Mosley sustained</i> convictions of bribed local officials whom courts considered to be federal officials under the prior bribery statute because they exerted federal authority and controlled the disbursement of federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn124\" id=\"fn124_ref\">124</a> Simple logic dictates that just because the Committee intended &#167; 666 in part to codify these cases does not meant that it sought to <i>limit</i> &#167; 666 to these cases exclusively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Del Toro,</i> the federal interest was more attenuated. The defendants were convicted of bribing a New York City official to ensure that they would supply office space to a city program that was eligible for federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn125\" id=\"fn125_ref\">125</a> The <i>Del Toro</i> court reversed these bribery convictions, noting that even if the official had succeeded in provisionally securing the lease as desired, three local agencies would have had to approve the lease before the city could apply to the federal government for funds, so that \"[t]here were no existing committed federal funds for the purpose.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn126\" id=\"fn126_ref\">126</a> The Senate Committee's intent to overrule <i>Del Toro</i> thus reflects that the Committee thought it necessary and proper for &#167; 666 to reach bribery even before the federal government had committed funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn127\" id=\"fn127_ref\">127</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most that can be concluded from the report, then, is that the Senate Judiciary Committee delimited the scope of &#167; 666 in part by seeking to exclude theft from suppliers but to include bribery of officials running programs that <i>might</i> receive federal funds. I do not see the report as shedding much light on our question. Lipscomb's conduct falls into a middle ground that the report simply does not address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>The 1981 Bill</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plot thickens still further when an effort is made to verify the assertion in the 1983 report that the language of &#167; 666 was derived from a 1981 bill that never became law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn128\" id=\"fn128_ref\">128</a> The 1981 bill and its report emerged from Senate Judiciary &#8212; the same committee that later wrote the 1983 bill and report. The Committee omitted from both the 1983 bill and the 1984 act, however, the very language in the 1981 bill that would have answered our question: (c) Jurisdiction. &#8212; There is federal jurisdiction over an offense described in this section if &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) the public servant is an agent of a State or local government charged by a federal statute, or by a regulation issued pursuant thereto, with administering monies or property derived from a federal program, <i>and the official action or legal duty</i> [with respect to which the bribe is taken] <i>is related to the administration of such program.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn129\" id=\"fn129_ref\">129</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in 1983, the Senate Judiciary Committee had in hand&#8212;and even mentioned &#8212; a two-year-old bill that would have required a federal interest or nexus as a jurisdictional predicate. Yet the 1983 bill and 1984 enactment contained none of that language or anything similar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn130\" id=\"fn130_ref\">130</a> The reason for that absence is unclear. In 1981, when the Committee clearly sought to require a federal nexus, it had sufficient command of the English language to do so. To suppose that the Committee lost that faculty over either two or four years is ludicrous. Section 666 as enacted and amended, therefore, might have reflected a change in the Senate Judiciary Committee's view on whether to require a federal nexus, but we cannot say this with certainty: For all we know, the Committee might well have sought to exercise federal criminal jurisdiction up to its constitutional limits, leaving the issue to the courts to decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Views of Other Courts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the reason for &#167; 666's silence on this question, the courts have struggled to produce the answer. Some district courts have tested &#167; 666 against the Tenth Amendment, treating the statute as an emanation of the spending power, and have come to varying conclusions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn131\" id=\"fn131_ref\">131</a> Additionally, four of our fellow appellate courts have examined the sweep of &#167; 666, either as a statutory matter or a constitutional one, and are also divided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb relies on <i>United States v.

Applying &#167; 666 to offense conduct, absent evidence of any federal interest, would appear to be an unconstitutional exercise of power under the Spending Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn133\" id=\"fn133_ref\">133</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To avoid this supposed constitutional problem, the <i>Zwick</i> court believed that to read &#167; 666 literally is to err, and held that \"&#167; 666 requires that the government prove a federal interest is implicated by the defendant's offense conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn134\" id=\"fn134_ref\">134</a> Not to require a nexus, reasoned the Third Circuit, would erase significant federal-state boundaries by turning &#167; 666 into a general anti-corruption law, which, in the Third Circuit's view, Congress had not intended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn135\" id=\"fn135_ref\">135</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What then, under <i>Zwick,</i> would constitute a federal interest? \"The amount of federal funds\" alone, reasoned the <i>Zwick</i> court, could constitute the interest if the federal funds provided \"the greater part of a township's budget\"; if not, the offense conduct would have to implicate a substantive or programmatic interest, even though \"a highly attenuated implication of a federal interest will suffice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn136\" id=\"fn136_ref\">136</a> Since deciding <i>Zwick,</i> the Third Circuit has clarified that the federal interest can reach very deep into the ranks of local government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn137\" id=\"fn137_ref\">137</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In diametric opposition to the Third Circuit, two other circuits have declined to read an extra-textual nexus into &#167; 666. The Sixth Circuit has rejected a constitutional attack on its pre-<i>Salinas</i> position that except for the textual $10,000 threshold, &#167; 666 does not require a nexus between federal funds and the offense conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn138\" id=\"fn138_ref\">138</a> The Supreme Court recently declined to review this result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn139\" id=\"fn139_ref\">139</a> The Seventh Circuit likewise has held that the broad text of &#167; 666 controls: \"It is not our part to trim &#167; 666 by giving its text a crabbed reading.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn140\" id=\"fn140_ref\">140</a> Noting that the fungibility of money militates against a narrow reading of &#167; 666, the Seventh Circuit concluded as a statutory matter that the district court properly convicted a township supervisor, even though his bribe-taking related only to his control of the town's general-assistance program, which did not receive any federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn141\" id=\"fn141_ref\">141</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his reliance on <i>Zwick,</i> Lipscomb would rely on a precedent from the Second Circuit, but close inspection of that case reveals that it actually supports his conviction here. In <i>United States v. Santopietro,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn142\" id=\"fn142_ref\">142</a> that court stood by its earlier requirement of \"at least some connection between the bribe and a risk to the integrity of the federal [sic] funded program.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn143\" id=\"fn143_ref\">143</a> &#8212; obviously a \"corruption focus.\" Nevertheless, the example that the Second Circuit gave of bribery that &#167; 666 would <i>not</i> reach &#8212; a bribe paid to the hypothetical meat inspector of a city that received a federal grant only for its parks department &#8212; involves a federal interest that is much more attenuated from the perpetrator than does this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn144\" id=\"fn144_ref\">144</a> Furthermore, the <i>Santopietro</i> court <i>affirmed</i> the convictions of former officials of Waterbury, Connecticut, who had accepted bribes from real estate developers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn145\" id=\"fn145_ref\">145</a> Linkage between the officials' offense conduct and federal funds was actually more remote than the connection in the instant case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]orrupt payments were made by real estate developers to secure the use of the appellants' influence with city agencies including the City Plan Commission, the Zoning Commission, the Water Department, and the Fire Marshal, and the use of their influence to further the interests of the developers in the appointments of members and chairpersons of land use boards and relevant committees and agencies in the City of Waterbury. During the relevant periods, substantial federal funds were received by Waterbury for housing, urban development, and other programs within the purview of these agencies and officials. <i>Since federal funds were received by Waterbury for housing and urban development programs and the corrupt payments concerned real estate transactions within the purview of the agencies administering federal funds, the requisite connection between the bribes and the integrity of federally funded programs is satisfied.</i> Thus, this is not a case where the transactions sought to be influenced concerned one department of a city and the requisite $10,000 of federal funds were received by a totally unrelated department.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn146\" id=\"fn146_ref\">146</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Santopietro</i> thus stands indisputably for a <i>purview</i> test: To be prosecuted under &#167; 666, a bribed official must at least influence other officials who have within their purview federally funded programs, but the corruption need not touch those programs. In other words, <i>Santopietro</i> asks whether a defendant <i>could have</i> influenced the use of federal funds by controlling the <i>same</i> agencies or staffers whom he actually corruptly influenced with respect to purely local matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a purview test, applied to the case at bar, supports convicting Lipscomb, who took bribes in return for influencing matters within the purviews of two Dallas departments, human services and transportation, which both received federal funds. The connection between federal funds and corrupt conduct is closer here than in <i>Santopietro,</i> where the court did not explain how the \"City Plan Commission, the Zoning Commission, the Water Department, and the Fire Marshal\" administered federal funds, but rather suggested that these agencies and officials made decisions &#8212; presumably determining whether proposed developments complied with zoning, fire, and other codes<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn147\" id=\"fn147_ref\">147</a> &#8212; with respect to housing and urban development programs, likely administered by other agencies, that did receive federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn148\" id=\"fn148_ref\">148</a> In other words, the federal interest in <i>Santopietro</i> was more remote than it is here, as Lipscomb himself cast votes to approve requests for federal funds, and himself both lobbied and pressured officials who ran federally-funded programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A less cumbersome and more direct purview rule would apply &#167; 666 to defendants who themselves influence or control federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn149\" id=\"fn149_ref\">149</a> Such a rule also would support convicting Lipscomb here. The <i>Santopietro</i> court, however, did not affirmatively adopt this rule, explicitly leaving open the question whether the former mayor could be prosecuted under &#167; 666 for <i>any</i> transaction involving the city if the federal funds were entirely unrelated to that transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn150\" id=\"fn150_ref\">150</a> <i>Santopietro,</i> therefore, although confirming a nexus rule, also could be read as supporting Lipscomb's conviction under such a rule or (just possibly) as skirting the relevant question entirely. Thus, of the two cases from other circuits &#8212; <i>Zwick</i> and <i>Santopietro</i> &#8212; that Lipscomb relies on heavily, only <i>Zwick</i> could support finding &#167; 666 unconstitutional as applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Federal Interests at Stake</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My own review is guided by the traditional, rational-relationship test for whether a statute is necessary and proper to an enumerated federal power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn151\" id=\"fn151_ref\">151</a> In this case, two federal interests support the view that Congress reasonably could have thought it necessary and proper to apply &#167; 666 to agents and officials like Lipscomb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Absolute Amount of Federal Dollars</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the <i>total</i> federal funding received by Dallas &#8212; $56 million in 1998 &#8212; justified federal jurisdiction over Lipscomb's conduct. Lipscomb focuses on the fact that $56 million was only 3.5% of Dallas's city budget in that year. In part, this is a dispute over the meaning of one passage in <i>Zwick:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can conceive of several ways in which the government could prove a federal interest in a &#167; 666 [case].... The amount of federal funds could provide the requisite federal implication, even if the purpose of those funds has no explicit relationship to the subject of the bribe. If, for example, in a given year, the greater part of a township's budget came from federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate federal interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn152\" id=\"fn152_ref\">152</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the abstract, this \"greater part\" yardstick may have an appealing ring, but it is utterly divorced from reality. In actuality, no state government and, I suspect, only a rare county or city government (not even the District of Columbia), is so wholly a creature of the United States as to rely on Washington for \"the greater part\" of its revenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn153\" id=\"fn153_ref\">153</a> In the rare case that federal funding is a majority of total revenue, federal power to criminalize local corruption would undoubtedly exist; but surely the <i>absolute</i> level of federal grants, as well as their <i>relative</i> importance to the city's budget, would provide a federal interest, to the protection of which &#167; 666 is necessary and proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether this is so &#8212; to judge if &#167; 666 is indeed reasonably related to the federal interest in safeguarding $56 million &#8212; I would analogize the federal government and Dallas to partners in spending federal dollars to advance shared goals. In the private sector, what would a reasonable funding partner who has advanced $56 million do after learning that its service partner takes kickbacks, albeit regarding matters not within the partnership's scope? The funding partner might well dissolve the partnership rather than wait for the service partner's corruption to widen and infect partnership dealings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The partnership analogy does not bear close inspection, but its failure, instead of undermining the constitutionality of &#167; 666, actually supports it. The analogy founders on the fact that in the public sector, states, counties, and municipalities hold monopolies on delivering many governmental services to their citizens. Thus, when Congress seeks to benefit the citizenry of a particular state and locality, it can turn to very few potential public partners. This scarcity suggests that if the federal-Dallas partnership were dissolved when corruption among Dallas officials is discovered &#8212; or if the federal government were to withhold funds in such a case &#8212; the purpose of the federally funded programs would be defeated, and Congress would be prevented from using the spending power to promote the welfare of citizens of Dallas. The populace of Dallas, however, is by definition innocent of official corruption, and should not suffer a cut in federally funded services on account of it. The prospective specter of criminal sanctions against corrupt officials themselves, rather than post-hoc, fiscally punitive measures against Dallas, is therefore a logical and appropriate solution for local corruption that threatens &#8212; even indirectly, as here &#8212; $56 million in federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council votes to apply for federal funds, to accept federal funds, and to approve all large contracts, including those involving federal funds. Congress could rationally believe that the integrity of $56 million of federal funds applied for by the Council &#8212; particularly when the federal treasury is funding not just one or two projects but many &#8212; suffices as a federal interest weighty enough to justify federal criminal jurisdiction over Council members who are bribed with respect to local issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Integrity of State and Local Officials with Authority over Federal Funds</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second federal interest at stake here is the integrity <i>vel non</i> of federal programs and funds, regardless of the quantum or budget percentage of funds at issue. A corrupt state or city official who has real responsibility for, or often participates in, the allocation of federal funds is a \"threat to the integrity\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn154\" id=\"fn154_ref\">154</a> of those funds, even if they are not actually or directly infected by his corruption. Congress may legitimately view as necessary and proper the imposition of federal criminal liability for bribery, so as to ensure the honesty of state and local officials who have federal funds in their purview or federal programs under their authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Smith advances two explicit arguments against such liability (neither of which, with respect, I find persuasive) and one implicit argument that is defeated by the text of the statute and the facts of this case. The implicit contention is that bribery of Lipscomb alone, apart from any of his fourteen council colleagues, cannot create a sufficient federal interest or nexus, because Lipscomb cannot act for the Council. This argument might also be grounded in the fact that, alone, one legislator does not administer program funds. The text of &#167; 666 disposes of this argument, as a statutory matter, because Congress clearly sought to apply &#167; 666 to legislative-branch officials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn155\" id=\"fn155_ref\">155</a> As a constitutional matter, there is little or no basis for holding that federal jurisdiction over bribery of Council members depends on whether the briber can command a majority. One Council member's vote, after all, can tip the balance on a close question; and, as Lipscomb's conduct here demonstrates, a member has a number of arrows in his parliamentary quiver besides the final vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Smith also speculates that the State of Texas would have prosecuted Lipscomb had it known of the evidence against him. This is not a constitutional argument; it merely begs the constitutional question regarding the limits of the spending power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn156\" id=\"fn156_ref\">156</a> And, as either a positive or a normative statement &#8212; that the federal government either does or should leave such prosecutions to the states &#8212; it fails. There are at least three reasons why federal rather than state bribery prosecutions might be necessary and proper in cases like Lipscomb's. First, the federal government might have a greater incentive to prosecute than does the state government, either because the offense conduct directly or potentially affects federal funds or because the federal government provides more money to the locality than does the state government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn157\" id=\"fn157_ref\">157</a> The latter proposition is true in this case: In terms of dollars provided to Dallas, the federal government has a stake in the city's fiscal integrity that is between fifteen and twenty times greater than the state's stake.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn158\" id=\"fn158_ref\">158</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, federal officials might be less corruptible than state and local officials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn159\" id=\"fn159_ref\">159</a> and an informant with evidence of misconduct by a state or local official might feel safer in taking his information to federal authorities; indeed, he could even prefer that it not be shared with state or local authorities. Third, federal prosecutors are less likely to be linked to state and local politicians and are generally more independent of local political forces that might try to protect high officials from aggressive state enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Smith's second contention against high-official liability is a law-and-economics argument that, in my opinion, does not hold water and affords courts little basis, if any, on which to pronounce a statute unconstitutional, whether facially or as applied. As I understand his argument, it is that if courts permit the United States as well as states to prosecute high local officials for bribery involving <i>local</i> funds and programs, corrupt officials will change their behavior and, on the margin, take more bribes directly related to <i>federal</i> funds and programs than they otherwise would.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn160\" id=\"fn160_ref\">160</a> With respect, I perceive at least three flaws of logic in this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, social science has not yet proven that the rational-actor model adequately explains the real-world behavior of white-collar criminals: As behavioral law and economics warns us, inadequate information, biases, and heuristics often prevent individuals from acting rationally. For example, unless a local official is well integrated into a culture of white-collar criminality (which would itself suggest that federal prosecution may be necessary), he will lack even anecdotal data on the probability that either the state or the federal government will detect and prosecute bribery. (Anecdotal data would, of course, be the only data available.) Therefore, an official considering whether to take a bribe would not be likely to calculate the odds of detection or prosecution in the dispassionately mathematical way that the rational-actor model might suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, standard law-and-economics analysis actually justifies federal criminal jurisdiction on the basis of interstate externalities, an argument eminently applicable here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn161\" id=\"fn161_ref\">161</a> If bribery in Dallas threatens federally-provided funds, that corruption threatens the federal Treasury, which is funded by taxes collected not just from Texas but from all across the Nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly and most importantly, even if Judge Smith's law-and-economics objection to federal jurisdiction here were an accurate predictor, it has little force. The most that his prediction might prove is that Congress has deluded itself into passing a law that may be self-defeating, because it increases the vulnerability of federal funds to corruption and thus disregards economic facts. \"But a law can be both economic folly and constitutional.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn162\" id=\"fn162_ref\">162</a> A means-ends tradeoff, weighing costs against benefits, is precisely the sort of political judgment that members of Congress are entitled &#8212; and better equipped than judges &#8212; to make, and that courts should generally defer to. As judges, we do not experience the perils attendant on taxing one's own constituents, do not enjoy the political significance of bringing home the fiscal bacon, and do not share the frustration of seeing hard-won federal dollars bleed off through the hands of corrupt local officials. Lacking the power to tax and spend, federal judges should defer to a plausible risk-reward construct that Congress has enacted to protect the federal fisc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Constitutional Limits to &#167; 666?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb strongly argues that if &#167; 666 constitutionally criminalizes conduct like his by state and local agents, then there are no limits to its sweep, and federal criminal law extends to briberies totally removed from federal funds. As I have analyzed Lipscomb's constitutional challenge to the statute as it applies to him, I need not determine here whether there is a constitutional limit on &#167; 666's reach. A brief comment is nonetheless in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a statutory matter, even <i>Westmoreland</i> &#8212; our broadest (and controlling) reading of &#167; 666 &#8212; did not address whether &#167; 666 can reach the lowest levels of state and local bureaucracies. <i>Westmoreland</i> did, however, advert to the limits in the statute's text:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he statute does not encompass every local bribery as Westmoreland suggests. Although the extent of the federal government's assistance programs will bring many organizations and agencies within the statute's scope, the statute limits its reach to entities that receive a substantial amount of federal funds and to agents who have the authority to effect significant transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn163\" id=\"fn163_ref\">163</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a constitutional matter, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, the test is whether prosecution would be rationally related to a federal interest &#8212; that is, to effecting Congress's spending power. In this case, two already-noted federal interests justify applying &#167; 666 to Lipscomb's conduct: (1) the total amount of federal funds extended to Dallas and (2) Lipscomb's purview &#8212; his high rank and his broad influence over many programs that receive federal funds. Of these two interests, his purview would easily accommodate, in another case, the Second Circuit's hypothetical implication in <i>Santopietro</i> that it could not be necessary and proper to the spending power for federal criminal liability to extend to a corrupt city meat inspector when the city receives federal funds only for its parks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn164\" id=\"fn164_ref\">164</a> That case is not before us today, however, so I need not predict, in double <i>dicta,</i> whether there might be categories of prosecutions under &#167; 666 that are not necessary and proper to the spending power. For today's purposes it is sufficient to note that if there are such categories, Lipscomb is far removed from them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional argument in this case boils down to how <i>direct</i> must local corruption's threat to federal funds be for &#167; 666 to apply. Lipscomb insists that, although federal funds need not be directly involved in the offense conduct, the state or local official's conduct still must threaten the integrity of federal funds more directly than did his. Not so. The foregoing analysis has shown that (1) the text of &#167; 666 reads otherwise; (2) the legislative history does not clearly contradict it (as it must to override a clear criminal statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn165\" id=\"fn165_ref\">165</a>); and (3) our controlling precedents on point reject such a limit. Reduced to the bare essentials, application of &#167; 666 to Lipscomb's conduct is indeed <i>reasonably related</i> to a <i>federal interest,</i> and thus is <i>necessary and proper</i> to Congress's exercise of its <i>spending power.</i> Congress could have believed, quite legitimately, that preventing federal funds from passing through state and local legislative bodies whose members are corrupt, and to do so with the deterrent of criminalizing the legislators' corruption, even with respect to purely state or local issues, was necessary and proper to the federal spending power. As courts can require of Congress nothing more than such a rational relationship to the spending power, &#167; 666 is constitutional as applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. VENUE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established that the federal courts have jurisdiction of this case, we turn to Lipscomb's assignments of reversible error by the district court. Chief among these is his contention that the court abused its discretion in transferring the trial from Dallas to Amarillo <i>sua sponte,</i> shortly before trial, and over Lipscomb's objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Transfer Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court read its unexpected transfer order into the record at the end of a hearing on December 20, 1999. The order reads, nearly in its entirety:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As everyone knows this case will involve the trial of one of the best[-]known sitting elected officials in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex for allegations of public corruption. This Court cannot recall such a trial of a sitting elected official in Dallas for allegations of public corruption. This case has already received significant media attention and undoubtedly will receive more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court notes that both sides have requested or not opposed requests for individual voir dire examination of the prospective jury panel and both sides have requested use of a jury questionnaire. Both motions, unusual and rare motions in federal criminal cases in Dallas, are made precisely because of the high profile of Defendant Lipscomb, a Dallas City Councilman of twelve years['] experience and one of the most influential and well[-]known political leaders in the Dallas African[-]American community for the last three decades. Councilman Lipscomb has been an effective representative of his constituency and locally has strong supporters and detractors. These facts will obviously make selection of a jury of twelve with no preconceived opinions about Al Lipscomb no easy task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated this case has thus far generated substantial publicity in the local media and will generate more throughout the trial. Such coverage has resulted in the Court reading in the newspapers certain information that has been filed under seal. The Court is also concerned about the ability to select a fair and impartial jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the various motions regarding jury selection that both sides have filed[,] the Court is not convinced that such measures would be sufficient to assure Councilman Lipscomb, the other defendants, and the Government a fair trial. It is this Court's fervent desire and absolute obligation to see to it that a fair trial is conducted &#8212; fair to both the defendants and the Government. This Court will do all in its power under the law to make sure the verdict in this case is based on the evidence presented in the courtroom, and absolutely nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no \"divisional\" venue in criminal cases under Federal Criminal Rule [sic] of Procedure 18.

The record shows that the defendant and all witnesses resided in Dallas. In addition, every defense attorney practiced there, and the judge was based in Dallas. Not a single relevant event occurred outside Dallas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn180\" id=\"fn180_ref\">180</a> As \"convenience of the prosecution ... is not a factor to consider in changing venue,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn181\" id=\"fn181_ref\">181</a> the convenience facts rarely cut as totally against transfer as they did here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not mention these contra-transfer facts in its order. It merely noted that Amarillo was served by several airlines, that it was a five hours' drive from Dallas, and &#8212; perhaps inaccurately and irrelevantly &#8212; that the defendants were represented by \"retained\" counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn182\" id=\"fn182_ref\">182</a> These facts, of course, did not diminish the basic truth that trial in Amarillo was inconvenient for Lipscomb, his counsel, and all witnesses. This case is, therefore, easily distinguishable from the two cases on which the district court relied, because convenience did not militate against transfer in either of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn183\" id=\"fn183_ref\">183</a> Those cases do not support the court's <i>sua sponte</i> transfer here, and the trial court erred as a matter of law in relying on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Court Policy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court also referred to its prior transfers of \"about 100 [criminal] cases\" from Wichita Falls to Dallas (less than half the distance, we note, as Dallas to Amarillo). This historical fact, however, does not support the transfer at issue. Nothing in the record shows why those transfers took place. Such reference to the court's prior venue practice verges on circularity and runs the risk of creating a <i>per se</i> rule that violates Rule 18's focus on the facts of each case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn184\" id=\"fn184_ref\">184</a> To whatever extent the district court perceived from past transfers a generalized but informal policy regarding transfers as a matter of course, without reference to the permissible considerations under Rule 18 that may have supported those transfers, it committed legal error by including an impermissible consideration in its Rule 18 balancing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As local court policy is irrelevant, and permissible convenience considerations militated strongly against transfer to Amarillo, the issue becomes whether any other legitimate factors, discernible from the record as it stood when the order was made, sufficiently supported transfer to bring this one within the range of discretionary choices to which we must defer on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Speedy Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule's second textual factor &#8212; \"due regard to ... the prompt administration of justice\" &#8212; is in part a literal command that trials comply with the Speedy Trial Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn185\" id=\"fn185_ref\">185</a> This factor, however, did not support trial transfer in this case, as a review of the record shows. Lipscomb was indicted on March 4, 1999, and he appeared in court the next day. Trial was initially set for May 17, but Lipscomb moved for continuance. The court refused to continue the trial date indefinitely, instead setting a hearing for May at which counsel had to submit their schedules for the coming months. Counsel for Lipscomb had court engagements scheduled in each month from August through November of 1999, so at the hearing, all parties agreed on January 10, 2000, as the trial date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn186\" id=\"fn186_ref\">186</a> Later, in November, the trial court extended the trial date one day, to January 11. Early in December, 1999, Lipscomb filed another motion to continue the trial, which motion the district court promptly denied. When, on December 20, the district court unexpectedly ordered the transfer, the parties already knew that (1) trial was firmly set for January 11 and (2) there was no reason to expect that voir dire would not begin on that day. Nothing in the record suggests that facilities appropriate for the trial were unavailable in Dallas at that time. There were thus no speedy-trial issues in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did characterize the possibility of a difficult voir dire as an obstacle to \"prompt administration.\" We do not understand the term \"prompt administration\" to have been promulgated in the Rules with the intention of permitting courts to avoid even attempting arduous voir dire proceedings. Rather, the triggering purpose of the \"prompt administration\" amendment to Rule 18 was to clarify that district courts are authorized to fix the place of trial so as to comply with the Speedy Trial Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn187\" id=\"fn187_ref\">187</a> That Act concerns itself solely with the timeliness of when trial <i>begins,</i> not with when either voir dire or the entire trial will <i>conclude,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn188\" id=\"fn188_ref\">188</a> and in this circuit, trial is deemed to begin with voir dire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn189\" id=\"fn189_ref\">189</a> Because the transfer to Amarillo did not change, much less hasten, the already-scheduled start of the trial, the transfer did not accomplish the \"prompt administration\" of this case in the textual, speedy-trial sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we have held that a trial court, in its discretion, may fix the place of trial with regard to factors other than convenience and prompt administration: such factors commonly include, but are not necessarily limited to, docket management, courthouse space and security, and &#8212; most importantly for this case &#8212; pretrial publicity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Docket Management</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of docket management, we have construed the term \"prompt administration of justice\" to refer not just to the particular case that may be transferred, but also to other trials on the court's docket.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn190\" id=\"fn190_ref\">190</a> A district court may consider docket management in its Rule 18 balancing, and docket issues may even outweigh convenience factors that point entirely the other way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn191\" id=\"fn191_ref\">191</a> But nothing in the court's remarks or in the record of this case suggests that docket management was implicated here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>Logistics</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor that a court may consider in fixing the place of trial within its district is whether a particular courthouse meets a particular trial's security requirements or other facilities needs. Courtroom availability, unsurprisingly, is a permissible consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn192\" id=\"fn192_ref\">192</a> So too are the amount of jail space available there for defendants or witnesses<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn193\" id=\"fn193_ref\">193</a> and the adequacy of security arrangements in a particular criminal trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn194\" id=\"fn194_ref\">194</a> Even so, the record and transfer order here are devoid of any indication that such logistical considerations played any role in the transfer from Dallas to Amarillo, and no party argues to us that they did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">6. <i>Pretrial Publicity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial publicity, then, is the only factor that might counterbalance convenience and render the transfer to Amarillo a proper exercise of discretion. We have not delineated the quality or quantity of prejudicial publicity that will support a <i>trial court's sua sponte</i> transfer in the face of countervailing convenience factors. We have, however, defined the opposite end of the zone of deference for <i>inter</i>district transfers: When pretrial publicity is the basis for a <i>defendant's</i> motion to transfer to another district under Rule 21, a trial court errs as a matter of law in denying such a motion only if the defendant can show that pretrial publicity inflamed the jury pool, pervasively prejudiced the community against the defendant, probatively incriminated the defendant, or exceeded \"the sensationalism inherent in the crime.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn195\" id=\"fn195_ref\">195</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court neither identified nor analyzed the publicity that it conclusionally relied on as sufficiently prejudicial to require a highly inconvenient transfer over the defendant's objections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn196\" id=\"fn196_ref\">196</a> Indeed, until after the trial, the record did not even contain copies of the publicity at issue. (Notably, we have not found one criminal case in which the trial court inferred prejudice justifying a transfer from publicity of which it merely took judicial notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn197\" id=\"fn197_ref\">197</a>) The court did nothing more than globally label the unspecified publicity as \"significant\" and \"substantial\" and state that voir dire in Dallas would be \"no easy task.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn198\" id=\"fn198_ref\">198</a> But surely, this is not the standard for determining whether pretrial publicity renders a trial unfair. The court's lack of record documentation or analysis on this point is particularly troubling in light of our acknowledgment that \"[e]very claim of potential jury prejudice due to publicity must turn upon its own facts.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn199\" id=\"fn199_ref\">199</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the trial court's statement to the contrary, it was not that court's duty, in ensuring a fair trial, to select \"a jury of twelve with no preconceived opinions about Al Lipscomb.\" This simply is not the applicable standard. The law is actually much more realistic:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified jurors need not [] be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror's impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn200\" id=\"fn200_ref\">200</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant's right to a fair trial is violated only if he shows that \"the trial atmosphere was `utterly corrupted by press coverage.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn201\" id=\"fn201_ref\">201</a> Therefore, even if inflammatory pretrial publicity did saturate the community, raising a presumption of prejudice to the defendant, the government can usually rebut this presumption through voir dire that ferrets out such prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn202\" id=\"fn202_ref\">202</a> In this case, to the extent that the district court focused on prejudice to the <i>government,</i> it failed to give Lipscomb any opportunity to rebut that presumption through voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exception to this rebuttable-presumption rule regarding prejudicial publicity was announced by the Supreme Court in <i>Rideau v. Louisiana,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn203\" id=\"fn203_ref\">203</a> in which a defendant's uncounselled, taped confession had been broadcast three times to two-thirds of a small community, rendering the venire pool presumptively prejudiced against him, so that confirmation of this prejudice through voir dire was not necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn204\" id=\"fn204_ref\">204</a> From <i>Rideau</i> we derived the following rules for habeas cases:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">where petitioner adduces evidence of inflammatory, prejudicial pretrial publicity that so pervades or saturates the community as to render virtually impossible a fair trial by an impartial jury drawn from that community, jury prejudice is presumed and there is no further duty to establish bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that virtually every case of any consequence will be the subject of some press attention, however, the <i>Rideau</i> principle of presumptive prejudice is only rarely applicable, and is confined to those instances where the petitioner can demonstrate an extreme situation of inflammatory pretrial publicity that literally saturated the community in which his trial was held.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn205\" id=\"fn205_ref\">205</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this standing caution against presuming prejudice, the trial court in this case essentially created out of whole cloth a <i>Rideau</i> exception for cases in which publicity is unfavorable to the government and (we infer) jury nullification is possible. Even if such a rule were proper, however, the record of this case would not support its application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb contends that such a rule would not be proper, urging that in fixing the quantum of prejudicial publicity that renders a highly inconvenient transfer discretionary, we should distinguish between publicity prejudicing the defendant and publicity prejudicing the government. Essentially, he proposes that publicity prejudicial to him may justify transfer, but publicity prejudicial to the government cannot. To support this contention, he points to the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 18, which state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place fixed for trial prejudice <i>against the defendant</i> so great as to render the trial unfair, the court may, of course, fix another place of trial within the district (if there be such) where such prejudice does not exist. Cf. Rule 21 dealing with transfers between districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn206\" id=\"fn206_ref\">206</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 21 &#8212; which some courts find illuminative of Rule 18<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn207\" id=\"fn207_ref\">207</a> &#8212; requires an <i>inter</i>district transfer for prejudice if the defendant requests it and the court determines that \"there exists in the district where the prosecution is pending so great a <i>prejudice against the defendant</i> that the <i>defendant</i> cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial at any place fixed by law for holding court in that district.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn208\" id=\"fn208_ref\">208</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot entirely accept Lipscomb's suggested distinction, because we have in fact upheld a <i>sua sponte intra</i>district transfer &#8212; to a division unrelated to the offense conduct, as here, and over the objection of the defendant &#8212; to cleanse the trial of the effects of publicity prejudicing the government. Yet, as Lipscomb correctly notes, whenever we have upheld a <i>sua sponte</i> transfer over the defendant's objection (whether the prejudice from publicity was to the government or to the defendant), a mistrial had already demonstrated that the venire pool had been badly tainted by publicity and that retrial within the transferring division would pose virtually insuperable difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our most recent ruling to this effect, in <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn209\" id=\"fn209_ref\">209</a> exemplifies this pattern: The defendant's first trial was interrupted by two bomb threats and ended in a hung jury, and his second trial ended in a mistrial after three jurors reported that they received anonymous phone calls urging them to convict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn210\" id=\"fn210_ref\">210</a> \"[C]onsiderable publicity ... from the first two trials\" resulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn211\" id=\"fn211_ref\">211</a> Under such easily distinguishable circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering an intradistrict transfer <i>sua sponte.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn212\" id=\"fn212_ref\">212</a> To the same effect are our decisions in <i>United States v. Weddell</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn213\" id=\"fn213_ref\">213</a> and <i>United States v. Dickie.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn214\" id=\"fn214_ref\">214</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Faulkner</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn215\" id=\"fn215_ref\">215</a> involved prosecution of businessmen who developed condominium projects and in the process exhausted the funds of several savings and loan associations in the Dallas area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn216\" id=\"fn216_ref\">216</a> The \"I-30 scandal\" generated 1,100 newspaper articles, an ad in a gubernatorial campaign mentioning a defendant in a negative light, and such a public awareness of the case that 60% of Dallas residents had formed an opinion that one defendant was guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn217\" id=\"fn217_ref\">217</a> After the first trial &#8212; held in the Lubbock division of the Northern District &#8212; ended in a mistrial, the trial court attempted voir dire in Dallas itself, but dismissed the panel after several days because of the effect of pretrial publicity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn218\" id=\"fn218_ref\">218</a> The court then granted the <i>defendants'</i> motions to transfer venue, moving the case to the El Paso division of the Western District, where the trial court <i>sua sponte</i> transferred the case yet again, to the Midland division of the same district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn219\" id=\"fn219_ref\">219</a> On appeal, given the unproblematical <i>inter</i>district transfer, we held that the second, <i>sua sponte</i> transfer did not amount to plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn220\" id=\"fn220_ref\">220</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No case of ours, therefore, stands squarely for the proposition that the government urges us to accept, i.e., that for purposes of the venue of a defendant's initial trial, pretrial publicity alone would permit the trial court, <i>sua sponte</i> and without a supporting record, to order an intradistrict transfer to a division entirely unrelated to the offense conduct, and in the process overrule the defendant's objection, giving no regard to convenience, making no attempt at voir dire, and expressing only a generalized desire to ensure that the government, as well as the defendant, receive a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his dissent, Judge Smith urges that the government's proposed rule is embodied in <i>United States v. Alvarado.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn221\" id=\"fn221_ref\">221</a> Even a cursory reading of <i>Alvarado,</i> however, shows that our terse discussion of the transfer issue there is entirely silent on several key questions: (1) Did the district court in that case transfer the case <i>sua sponte;</i> (2) if the transfer was <i>sua sponte,</i> did the district court create a record that showed prejudice by analyzing publicity or by attempting <i>voir dire;</i> (3) by what standard did the district court determine the publicity to be prejudicial; and (4) what was the nature of the publicity itself?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn222\" id=\"fn222_ref\">222</a> From the opinion, none of these issues appears to have been contested. As far as the <i>Alvarado</i> opinion goes, the defendants' argument was founded entirely on a miscitation and misunderstanding of the criminal venue statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn223\" id=\"fn223_ref\">223</a> Research into the district court case confirms not only that the <i>Alvarado</i> defendants actually moved to transfer, but also that they asked (unsuccessfully) that a newspaper reporter be instructed not to print anything concerning the rejection of a plea agreement, lest such publicity prejudice the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn224\" id=\"fn224_ref\">224</a> The <i>Alvarado</i> district court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendants' motion to transfer \"due to publicity in the area\" and took the motion under advisement until after voir dire on publicity was concluded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn225\" id=\"fn225_ref\">225</a> At that point, the district court denied the motion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn226\" id=\"fn226_ref\">226</a>; but the court later reconsidered that denial and granted the motion after a witness caused a mistrial by testifying that defendants had pled guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn227\" id=\"fn227_ref\">227</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All these facts provide context for, and render entirely understandable, the silence of our <i>Alvarado</i> opinion. These facts also completely distinguish <i>Alvarado</i> from this case: The <i>Alvarado</i> trial court did <i>not</i> transfer the case <i>sua sponte</i> as did the <i>Lipscomb</i> court; and the <i>Alvarado</i> defendants advocated transfer, unlike Lipscomb, who vigorously opposed it. Rather than undermine our conclusion here, the <i>Alvarado</i> facts confirm our impression that the transfer in the instant case was quite unusual. Any court that views <i>Alvarado</i> as trumping today's holding under our rule of orderliness will have been led into serious error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn228\" id=\"fn228_ref\">228</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have found only one case (from another circuit) that comes close to supporting the proposition for which the government contends, but that case ultimately is unpersuasive. In <i>United States v. Mabry,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn229\" id=\"fn229_ref\">229</a> a defendant moved for individual voir dire regarding pretrial publicity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn230\" id=\"fn230_ref\">230</a> The trial court interpreted this motion as raising a concern about whether trial in the Albuquerque division of the district of New Mexico would be fair &#8212; seemingly <i>to the defendants,</i> not to the government &#8212; and transferred the case, over the defendants' objections, to Roswell,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn231\" id=\"fn231_ref\">231</a> which we estimate to be some two hundred miles from Albuquerque. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit found no abuse of discretion: \"There was no substantial inconvenience to the defendants or the witnesses as a result of the transfer and no real prejudice has been demonstrated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn232\" id=\"fn232_ref\">232</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern several reasons not to follow the <i>Mabry</i> result here. First, the <i>Mabry</i> district court did not appear to transfer the case out of concern that the <i>government</i> receive a fair trial. To this extent, <i>Mabry</i> actually supports Lipscomb's contention on that point. Second, the cases on which the Tenth Circuit relied buttress <i>Mabry</i>'s result only weakly, if at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn233\" id=\"fn233_ref\">233</a> Third, <i>Mabry</i>'s transfer holding has been largely ignored by other courts, perhaps because the Supreme Court later abrogated <i>Mabry</i>'s entrapment-instruction holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn234\" id=\"fn234_ref\">234</a> <i>Mabry</i> is thus hardly persuasive authority here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here did not learn through hard experience that voir dire would be challenging. It developed no facts to suggest that the pretrial publicity presumptively or actually tainted the jury pool; it failed to analyze the publicity itself for prejudice; it applied a wrong and unrealistically high standard to determine whether the putative jury would be prejudiced; and it relied on cases of ours that are not on point. There is a plethora of support for holding that the district court abused its discretion in transferring Lipscomb's case to Amarillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">7. <i>Summary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both our precedents and persuasive authorities from other courts suggest, even if only by negative implication, that this case's facts and proceedings make it a true outlier in the Rule 18 jurisprudence. In concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in the aforementioned cases, neither we nor the other courts have purported to fix any bright-line boundary of that discretion. We are constrained to set one such limit by example, however, believing that the district court's doctrinal mistakes and clear factual errors make this case an appropriate vehicle with which to circumscribe at least one boundary of the use of Rule 18 discretion. When as here, facts of convenience militate exclusively <i>against</i> transfer, and no factor other than pretrial publicity &#8212; some favorable and some unfavorable to both the prosecution and the defense &#8212; might, if properly developed and analyzed, militate in favor of transfer, the trial court abuses its discretion under Rule 18 by ordering a far-distant intradistrict transfer, <i>sua sponte</i> and over the defendant's objections, without (1) attempting voir dire or otherwise creating a record, (2) providing an analysis of the publicity for the record to show how it prejudiced the jury pool, or (3) conducting a <i>Rideau</i>-style presumptive analysis. In this instance, we as an appellate court can detect virtually nothing on the Rule 18 scale to counterbalance the defendant's established inconvenience; and something outweighs nothing every time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the district court's abuse of discretion, we must reverse Lipscomb's conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial in a venue determined consistently with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court had jurisdiction to try Lipscomb for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, which is facially constitutional and &#8212; in my own sole opinion &#8212; is constitutional as applied to him. As we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in transferring Lipscomb's trial, however, we must reverse and remand for a new trial. The other issues Lipscomb raises on appeal are either moot, meritless, or irrelevant to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CONVICTION REVERSED, SENTENCE VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 (2000) (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>United States v.

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Wiener's opinion merges analysis of jurisdiction with analysis of the constitutionality of &#167; 666. In Part IV of his opinion, Judge Wiener writes that the term \"federal jurisdiction\" is ambiguous, and defines it for purposes of this case as encompassing (a) the question whether we have subject matter jurisdiction under &#167; 666 over Lipscomb's conduct (which Judge Wiener calls \"adjudicative jurisdiction\"), and (b) the question whether Congress had the authority to enact &#167; 666 (which Judge Wiener terms \"legislative jurisdiction\", and we term constitutionality). In this manner, Judge Wiener reaches the constitutionality of &#167; 666, by calling it a jurisdictional question. With all due respect, this is a categorization with no support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurisdiction is discussed in terms of \"legislative\" and \"adjudicative\" in only one context in American law &#8212; native American law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> This case does not arise in that context, so we must follow the generally applied definition of \"federal jurisdiction\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> defines \"federal jurisdiction\" as \"powers of federal courts founded on United States Constitution (Article III) and Acts of Congress (e.g. Title 28 of United States Code)\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Federal jurisdiction is <i>not</i> defined as the power of Congress to enact a statute.

He writes: \"[A] federal forum must lack adjudicative jurisdiction to hear a case based on a federal statute that Congress lacked the legislative jurisdiction (translation: constitutional power or authority) to apply to the situation in question.\" This implies that federal courts must <i>always</i> consider constitutionality, even raising it <i>sua sponte,</i> when interpreting a statute.

This is an abstract description of our task &#8212; what it means here is that we must first determine whether Lipscomb's actions fall within the jurisdiction of &#167; 666, and if our answer is \"yes,\" then address the merits of his appeal. It is at this second step that, were constitutionality at issue, it would arise.

A panel of this court affirmed her conviction. Judge King's carefully crafted opinion first considers the jurisdictional scope of &#167; 666. After finding that &#167; 666 did apply to Westmoreland's conduct, and thereby answering the jurisdictional question in the affirmative, the opinion addresses the substantive issues of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine years later, the Supreme Court decided <i>Salinas v.

There, the Court affirmed the sheriff's conviction, holding that federal jurisdiction under &#167; 666 is not limited to cases in which the bribe has a demonstrated effect upon federal funds. The Court later asserted the constitutionality of &#167; 666 as applied to that case. The <i>Salinas</i> decision followed the two-step approach &#8212; first determine jurisdiction, and then address whatever substantive issues are before the court.

No discussion of the merits was required; and the ensuing discussion on potential constitutional issues is entirely dicta, because this court was without jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our most recent holding on the applicability of &#167; 666 was in <i>United States v.

Lipscomb argues that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction, because his actions do not fall within those governed by &#167; 666. He argues that jurisdiction under &#167; 666 does not extend to cases of local bribery such as his, where the underlying conduct does not directly involve federal funds. A detailed review of Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent demonstrates that his argument fails as a matter of statutory construction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) Early Fifth Circuit Precedent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first interpreted &#167; 666 in <i>United States v.

By the terms of section 666, when a local government agency receives an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a federal assistance program, its agents are governed by the statute, and an agent violates subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct \"in <i>any</i> transaction or matter or series of transactions or matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the affairs of\" the local government agency. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(b) (Supp. 1984) [emphasis added]. Subsection (b) contains nothing to indicate that \"any transaction involving $5,000\" means \"any federally funded transaction involving $5,000\" or \"any transaction involving $5,000 of federal funds,\" and other subsections of the statute contain no inconsistent provisions that might suggest such a qualification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next reviewed the jurisdictional reach of &#167; 666 in <i>United States v.

The <i>Westmoreland</i> view of &#167; 666 therefore continues to be the law in this circuit, and precludes us from more narrowly construing the statute here. Because Lipscomb's actions satisfy the jurisdictional requirements found in the language of &#167; 666, we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to try Lipscomb under &#167; 666, and turn to the issues which the parties put before us on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

However, although my colleagues hold otherwise, it is not our question today. We may only decide those issues properly before us, and the constitutional question is not such an issue.

He did not term it \"jurisdiction\" as a means of raising extraterritoriality <i>sua sponte,</i> in an end-run around our requirement that parties argue those issues they wish before us.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 612 (1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> <i>See</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> (1994).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> <i>See id.</i> at 167-246.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> <i>See App. Brief</i> at 28.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> <i>See Steel Co. v.

However, the Supreme Court's assertion in passing that &#167; 666 was constitutional as applied does not bind us to rule on the constitutionality of &#167; 666 as applied to Lipscomb here. First, we are not the Supreme Court and have different limitations on our jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, unlike us, is the definitive voice in interpreting federal statutes. <i>See</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> 571 (1994). Second, the Supreme Court in <i>Salinas</i> declined to avoid the constitutional question because it considered it a greater disservice to \"rewrite language enacted by the legislature\" than to fail to avoid the issue. <i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>. This reasoning does not compel us to reach the constitutionality of &#167; 666 here; if anything, it counsels against that. We are <i>not</i> rewriting &#167; 666 &#8212; we are faithfully reading the language of the statute, and recognizing that in order to question the congressionally-enacted language, the issue of constitutionality must be explicitly before us.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29-1_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118365\"><a href=\"/opinion/118365/fischer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118365\"><a href=\"/opinion/118365/fischer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I seek no magic words; I wish only that the parties would clearly raise those issues they wish us and the district court to decide (as our precedent requires). The parties here did not meet even this most-light burden on the issue of the constitutionality of &#167; 666.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, Judge Smith accuses me of invoking the \"rigid form pleading\" that was eliminated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This misunderstands my analysis. To the contrary, I am not concerned with what the parties raise in the complaints and answers that set out in broad brushstrokes the case they intend to bring. However, we must (and our precedent shows we do) require parties to specifically argue before us and the district court, at some point during the adjudication of their dispute, what issues they wish decided. The courts are not required to divine what issues are before them, nor do they have the power to choose what issues they would like to be before them &#8212; that is the responsibility of the parties.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The conclusions of Judge Wiener and Judge Smith place a burden on the trial court to read between the lines of the parties' arguments and ascertain what the parties \"should have\" or \"could have\" argued. That is just not the way our judicial system works. The burden lies with the parties to place a case or controversy before the court. On the issue of constitutionality, that burden was not met here. Requiring judges to act as mindreaders, as Judge Wiener and Judge Smith do here, cannot be an acceptable part of our judicial system.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p297\">\n      <span class=\"num\">297</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the conviction and render a judgment of dismissal with prejudice, thereby precluding a retrial of defendant Albert Lipscomb. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the contrary result reached by Judge Wiener's opinion and Judge Duh&#233;'s partial concurrence, which is to subject this seventy-seven-year-old defendant &#8212; who has already served more than half of his approximately three and one-half-year sentence of incarceration waiting for his appeal to be decided &#8212; to a new trial under a statute that has no application to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p298\">\n      <span class=\"num\">298</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of the three judges on this panel are of the view that Lipscomb properly raised the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 is unconstitutional as applied to him. Nonetheless, we fail to decide that issue because one of the judges declines to address it, leaving the other two judges evenly split on the question.

Why would he employ a \"Special Counsel for Tenth Amendment purposes only,\" and have that counsel sign the motion? Why would he twice invoke the Tenth Amendment and cite the Tenth Amendment cases of <i>Gregory, Printz,</i> and <i>New York v. United States,</i> as well as <i>Alden</i>'s Tenth Amendment discussion? Why would he six times argue that &#167; 666 abridges the states' constitutional responsibilities and prerogatives?

Since when do we accord one word such talismanic power that its mere presence or absence in a motion or brief can negate all remaining arguments? Since when do we forbid a defendant from raising two points &#8212; both constitutionality and jurisdiction &#8212; in one motion?

As Judge Wiener explains, sometimes Lipscomb uses \"jurisdiction\" to refer to a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction, and sometimes he uses \"jurisdiction\" to refer to the persons and acts over which Congress may legislate. But any confusion is easily eliminated: Substitute \"federal power\" or \"congressional power\" every time Lipscomb says \"jurisdiction\" in his motion, and the motion's meaning remains the same.

Beyond those limits, the \"delicate balance of federalism\" is obliterated, he argues. Finally, Lipscomb notes that a prosecution under &#167; 666 must be \"undergirded by some adequate federal jurisdictional base\" to avoid <i>serious constitutional problems.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p326\">\n      <span class=\"num\">326</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Lipscomb uses the term \"jurisdiction\" loosely, and he sometimes makes two arguments under one heading in his brief.

If Lipscomb is convicted a second time, he presumably will appeal (if he lives that long; he is elderly and too ill to be incarcerated in prison). In his second appeal, Lipscomb could argue the same constitutional claim before this same court &#8212; perhaps even before this same panel &#8212; and this time, because he was careful to omit the word \"jurisdiction\" from his brief, he could be acquitted and told that the government never had the power to try or detain him in the first case.

The Court held that when Congress chooses to go beyond specific enumerated powers and to use its spending power \"to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal monies upon compliance with federal statutory and administrative directives,\" it must meet four conditions, the failure to meet any of which might render a statute unconstitutionally broad: (1) The power must be used in pursuit of the general welfare; (2) Congress must state any conditions unambiguously; (3) conditions must be related to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs; and (4) conditions must not violate other independent constitutional restrictions on government activity. <i>Id.</i> at 207-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111939\"><a href=\"/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, &#167; 666 does not unambiguously state that certain conditions attach to the receipt of any particular federal grants. Second, a condition statute generally requires a state's compliance with federal regulatory or administrative directives in exchange for receipt of federal funds. <i>Va. Dep't of Educ. v.

Unfortunately, the Court did not reveal the framework it used in concluding that &#167; 666 was constitutionally applied in <i>Salinas,</i> nor did it say what test should be used in determining whether other applications of the statute are constitutional. We conduct our own inquiry, because this case, unlike <i>Salinas,</i> does not involve any readily apparent connection to federal funds or programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p338\">\n      <span class=\"num\">338</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have said, the fact that &#167; 666 is not a direct exercise of the spending power does not doom its constitutionality. The Constitution gives Congress the power \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" U.S. CONST. art. I, &#167; 8. Thus, to determine whether the application of &#167; 666 to Lipscomb's acceptance of bribes by a local taxi company is constitutional, we must decide whether prosecuting such behavior is \"necessary and proper\" to carrying out Congress's spending power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2\" id=\"fn6-2_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p339\">\n      <span class=\"num\">339</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine the relevant legislative history to discover why Congress thought that &#167; 666 was necessary and for what purposes it deemed the statute proper, for although Congress is not the final judge of what is necessary and proper to carry out its powers, it is likely to have an informed opinion on the matter. Such opinion is particularly persuasive to the extent that it finds legislation is necessary and proper only in limited circumstances, because, in such cases, we need not worry that Congress's interpretation is motivated by a desire to expand its power beyond proper bounds. Thus, when Congress states that legislation passed as necessary and proper to carry out one of its enumerated powers is actually necessary only in certain circumstances, we should be hesitant to conclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits the legislation to reach further than Congress felt necessary or proper to carry out its delegated powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p340\">\n      <span class=\"num\">340</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have recognized the particular relevance of the legislative history of &#167; 666 in cases &#8212; like this &#8212; in which that history shows Congress's limited goals in drafting a broadly worded statute. The legislative history of the act shows that Congress passed &#167; 666 because it was concerned with its inability to protect federal funds once they are transferred from the federal government to states, local governments, and agencies. Section 666 \"is designed to create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery involving Federal monies that are disbursed to private organizations or State and local governments pursuant to a Federal program.\" 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510 (emphasis added). Congress also stated that \"the purpose of this section [is] to protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p341\">\n      <span class=\"num\">341</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Salinas,</i> the Court noted that &#167; 666 was enacted in response to specific difficulties the federal government had encountered under preceding statutes in prosecuting the theft of federal funds by non-federal employees. The Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p342\">\n      <span class=\"num\">342</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before &#167; 666 was enacted, the federal criminal code contained a single, general bribery provision codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201. Section 201 by its terms applied only to \"public official[s],\" which the statute defined as \"officer[s] or employee[s] or person[s] acting for or on behalf of the United States....\" &#167; 201(a). The Courts of Appeals divided over whether state and local employees could be considered \"public officials\" under &#167; 201(a) .... &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) was designed to extend federal bribery prohibitions to bribes offered to state and local officials employed by agencies receiving federal funds. The facts and reasoning of <i>[United States v.] Del Toro,</i> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326715\"><a href=\"/opinion/326715/united-states-v-william-del-toro-and-william-kaufman/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 661-62 (2d Cir.1975)], give particular instruction in this respect. In that case, the Second Circuit held that a city employee was not a \"public official\" under &#167; 201(a) even though federal funds would eventually cover 100% of the costs and 80% of the salaries of the program he administered. 513 F.2d, at 662. Because the program had not yet entered a formal request for federal funding, the Second Circuit reasoned, \"[t]here were no existing committed federal funds for the purpose.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The enactment of &#167; 666 forecloses this type of limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p343\">\n      <span class=\"num\">343</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 58-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here again, the defendant was covered by &#167; 201, because he exercised discretion in the administration of federal funds. In <i>Zwick,</i> the court concluded that the inclusion of these cases as examples of conduct that would be covered by &#167; 666 showed that Congress intended that the statute would be applied only in corruption cases impacting federal interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-2\" id=\"fn8-2_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p349\">\n      <span class=\"num\">349</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I do not agree that the plain language of &#167; 666 allows prosecution only where the charged corrupt activity has impact on a federal interest, the fact that Congress did not find it necessary that &#167; 666 be applied in cases not involving federal funds or programs is highly relevant to the issue of whether the statute's application to local corruption not involving federal funds is \"necessary and proper\" to execute the spending power. Armed with knowledge of Congress's purpose in enacting &#167; 666, I examine whether the statute's employment here &#8212; to prosecute a city councilmember for accepting bribes in return for pursuing local taxi regulations beneficial to a local taxi company &#8212; is \"necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the spending power. In other words, what are the minimum factors that must be present to make a prosecution under &#167; 666 \"necessary and proper\" under the spending power? I am aware of no court that has dealt with the issue of what uses of &#167; 666 are necessary and proper to effect the spending power. Of no help is <i>United States v.

Their views on what limitations are necessary to keep &#167; 666 within the realm of constitutionality are therefore useful. In <i>Zwick,</i> the court interpreted &#167; 666 to require a relationship between the prohibited conduct and a federal interest, because doing otherwise would raise constitutional problems:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p350\">\n      <span class=\"num\">350</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting &#167; 666 to have no federal interest requirement produces serious concerns as to whether Congress exceeded its power under the Spending Clause in enacting this statute. <i>See McCormack,</i> 31 F.Supp.2d at 187-89.

Thus, in <i>Salinas</i> the Court found that &#167; 666 did not \"extend federal power beyond its proper bounds,\" <i>id.</i> at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government argues that because funds are fungible, and the receipt of federal funds for any project frees a state to spend more funds on other projects, no more is required for a prosecution under &#167; 666 than that a local government receive at least $10,000 in federal funds annually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p361\">\n      <span class=\"num\">361</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is, strictly speaking, a correct textual interpretation of &#167; 666, the statute obviously does not satisfy constitutional requirements when used in this manner; it cannot be necessary and proper to executing the spending power for the government to prosecute local crimes that have no relationship whatsoever to federal funds and programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p362\">\n      <span class=\"num\">362</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any argument that it is \"necessary\" to protect the spending power by passing legislation that regulates conduct totally unrelated to federal spending is meritless on its face.

The government has a similar interest in a great many things that are, however, beyond its power to regulate directly. For example, members of Congress profess sincere interest in a variety of problems &#8212; from reducing crime to encouraging the stability of marriage &#8212; yet Congress has no more power directly to criminalize local burglaries than it does to regulate marriage directly. In both cases, if the government wishes to pursue its interest, it must do so through targeted spending and conditional grants of federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-2\" id=\"fn18-2_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p367\">\n      <span class=\"num\">367</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this conflation of generalized federal interests with a federal interest in a program (i.e., a connection to federal funding) that prompts the government to argue that any generalized interest of the United States suffices to allow federal criminalization of local matters, so long as some insignificant amount of federal funds are given to the locality. Such an analysis turns the accepted understanding of the Necessary and Proper Clause on its head and, in effect, asserts that because Congress may pursue the general welfare through the Spending Clause, all laws that are necessary and proper to the general welfare must be considered constitutional under the Spending Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-2\" id=\"fn19-2_ref\">19</a> This argument, if followed, would overturn the accepted meaning of the Spending and the General Welfare Clauses that has existed for nearly two centuries. <i>See generally</i> 1 TRIBE, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 5-6, at 831-34 (3d ed. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p368\">\n      <span class=\"num\">368</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, alternatively, that if a connection is required between federal funding or programs and the charged corruption, such connection is present in this case. The federal connection that the government asserts, however, is exceedingly tenuous. The government avers that a federal connection existed between Lipscomb's acts of corruption and federal funds because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p369\">\n      <span class=\"num\">369</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipscomb voted to seek and disburse federal money on improvements to Love Field airport. Thus, the federal government had an interest in the success of the airport, a center of interstate travel. It is common sense that an airport depends in part for its success on the taxicab service provided for passengers. On the flip side, taxicabs depend in part for their success on the viability of airports, which provide fertile ground for fares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p370\">\n      <span class=\"num\">370</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If merely the airport &#8212; rather than the city as a whole &#8212; is seen as the analog of the jail in <i>Salinas,</i> that case's holding must extend to this one. Lipscomb, like the jailer, was partly responsible for managing a federally-funded entity, the airport. The airport in turn provided business to, and needed the business of, taxicabs (including Richards' taxicabs) for its success &#8212; just as the jail had a direct relationship with the welfare of the prisoner who paid the bribes. And just as the preferential treatment given to the prisoner was \"a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program,\" <i>Salinas,</i> 522 U.S. at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government may as well argue that because the United States funds medical research at Dallas hospitals, and researchers sometimes take taxis, especially to airports to fly to conferences, there is a sufficient nexus between taxis and federal funds. Or, the government could aver that federal funds go to pay welfare benefits and, because welfare recipients often cannot afford cars, they may take taxis to the grocery store to use their food stamps, and thus federal prosecution of cases of local bribery affecting taxi regulations is necessary to protect the spending power. In sum, if the government's posited connection between the federal funds and the corruption is sufficient to provide nexus, any connection at all will do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p372\">\n      <span class=\"num\">372</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case reveal no substantial relationship to federal funds or programs, whereas in <i>Salinas</i> there were three direct connections between federal funds and the corrupt activity. First, the prisoner paying the bribes was a federal prisoner. Second, the county jail in which the prisoner was housed had been constructed substantially with federal funds. Third, the prisoner was in the jail as part of a federal program in which the county was paid <i>per diem</i> for each federal prisoner it housed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p373\">\n      <span class=\"num\">373</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, to the contrary, Richards, who was the person paying the bribes, had no federal status or connection. Neither the taxis nor the city regulation of the taxi industry was funded by federal funds in any way. Finally, there was no federal program relating to taxi regulation, nor was the integrity of any federally funded program affected by the payment of Lipscomb to vote for certain taxi regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p374\">\n      <span class=\"num\">374</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the connection between federal funds and the prosecuted activity here is nothing like the direct connections between federally funded programs and corrupt activity in <i>Salinas.</i> It is far less substantial than even the most attenuated connections that the Third Circuit imagined might suffice to avoid constitutional questions in <i>Zwick.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20-2\" id=\"fn20-2_ref\">20</a> Under the specific facts of this case, the connection to federal funds is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a conclusion that the &#167; 666 prosecution was necessary and proper to protect federal funding of Love Field or the city generally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21-2\" id=\"fn21-2_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p375\">\n      <span class=\"num\">375</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government alternatively posits that, because the City of Dallas received a sizeable amount of federal funds in real dollars, it was proper for Lipscomb's bribery to be federally prosecuted. The government points out that in 1998, the city accepted over $56 million in federal funds. This, it argues, is a significant amount that warrants the federal prosecution of a local official even for mere local corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p376\">\n      <span class=\"num\">376</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the receipt of this large amount of federal money would make the prosecution of Lipscomb pass muster even under <i>Zwick.</i> This is plainly incorrect. <i>Zwick</i> stated that if \"the greater part of a township's budget came from federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate federal interests.\" <i>Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d at 687 (emphasis added). The city received over $56 million in 1998 &#8212; admittedly a significant amount. Because its 1988 budget was $1.6 billion, however, federal funds made up only 3.5% of the City's budget.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p377\">\n      <span class=\"num\">377</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is nowhere near the example given in <i>Zwick,</i> where a federal interest could arise if the \"greater part of a township's budget\" came from federal funds. Indeed, if federal funding of as little as 3.5% of a city's budget allows prosecution of a city official, then the fact that every state and most cities receive more than $10,000 in federal funds each year is alone enough to allow the federalization of local corruption cases. This cannot be necessary and proper for executing the spending power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>5.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p378\">\n      <span class=\"num\">378</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government further contends that Lipscomb was not just any city employee and that as a city councilman he \"was one of fifteen people responsible for running the City of Dallas.\" The government then argues that high officials, such as Lipscomb, always should be liable for prosecution under &#167; 666, because high officials make decisions on the disposition of both local and federal funds, and therefore dishonesty in the disposition of local funds is a proper cause of worry to the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22-2\" id=\"fn22-2_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p379\">\n      <span class=\"num\">379</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that such prosecution is necessary, because otherwise corrupt officials would be left in place to administer federal funds in the same corrupt fashion that they administer local matters. While this argument has some initial appeal, it ultimately has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p380\">\n      <span class=\"num\">380</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it seems unlikely that, had the state prosecutor been given the fruits of the Lipscomb investigation, he would have declined to prosecute. The charges against Lipscomb were serious, the evidence was compelling, and Lipscomb was a high-profile public servant &#8212; all factors that strongly argue for state prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p381\">\n      <span class=\"num\">381</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if one thinks that states sometimes do not prosecute local crimes where federal prosecutors might do so, it does not follow that allowing double prosecution of local crimes would deter corruption involving federal funds and programs. Instead, allowing the double prosecution of local, but not federal, corruption might tend to cause dishonest local officials to abuse federal dollars rather than local funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p382\">\n      <span class=\"num\">382</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before &#167; 666 was enacted, local embezzlement was covered by local penalties, and federal embezzlement was covered by federal penalties, with only small overlap. Thus, before the advent of &#167; 666, a rational local official would simply weigh the rewards of embezzling local or federal funds against the risk of getting caught and the probable penalty carried by each crime. He then would commit those acts of embezzlement with the best ratio of payoff-to-punishment. Because of the severity of federal penalties, the most rational acts of embezzlement often would be local.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p383\">\n      <span class=\"num\">383</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If &#167; 666 is used to prosecute purely local acts of corruption, however, this calculus changes substantially. Federal acts of corruption still carry the same ratios of reward-to-punishment, but local crimes of corruption now qualify as both federal and local crimes. Thus, federal embezzlement would be more rewarding at the margins than would be local embezzlement. As a result, rather than protecting federal funds and programs, &#167; 666, if applied to purely local crimes, should actually cause an increase in the criminal misuse of federal funds; accordingly, it cannot be said that prosecution of local crimes under &#167; 666 is necessary and proper to carry into execution the spending power, and the application of &#167; 666 to Lipscomb on the facts of this case is, accordingly, unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p384\">\n      <span class=\"num\">384</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel majority errs in deciding the question of venue.

Instead, the jury instructions merely stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is also not necessary that the $10,000 in federal assistance be directly involved in or traced to the allegedly corrupt acts charged in the Indictment. All that is necessary is that the City of Dallas received in excess of $10,000 from the federal government during a one-year period.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22-2_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> <i>Santopietro,</i> 166 F.3d at 94 n. 3, also raised this question, but did not answer it:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We need not consider whether Santopietro's role as mayor &#8212; the chief executive officer of the city and hence the officer ultimately responsible for all city departments &#8212; would render the statute applicable to corrupt payments received by him for any transaction involving the city, even though the federal funds were received for a program entirely unrelated to the program in connection with which the corrupt payments were made.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23-2_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> <i>United States v.
