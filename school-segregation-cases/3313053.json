Box 1015 Ottawa, Kansas  66067</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Bezek:</p>\n<p>As legal counsel for the City of Baldwin City, you request our opinion regarding the applicability of accessibility standards to a facility. Specifically, you ask whether the renovation of a fraternity house is subject to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> and the Kansas Architectural Accessibility Standards Act.<sup id=\"ref-fn2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Upon finding that American society \"ha[d] tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities and . . . such forms of discrimination . . . continue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem; . . . [and] the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities [were] to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals . . . ,\"<sup id=\"ref-fn3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> the United States Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Title III<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> of the ADA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \"No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\"<sup id=\"ref-fn5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>\"In order to be a place of public accommodation [under Title III], a facility must be operated by a private entity, its operations must affect commerce, and it must fall within one of these 12 categories [set forth in subsections (7)(A) through (L) of <cross_reference>42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 12181</cross_reference>]. . . . [T]he list of categories is exhaustive. . . .\"<sup id=\"ref-fn6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> Of the twelve categories listed, the only one which may apply to the situation reviewed herein is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \"(A) [A]n inn, hotel, motel, <em>or other place of</em> <em>lodging</em>, except for an establishment located within a building that contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and that is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as the residence of such proprietor. . . .\"<sup id=\"ref-fn7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The categories are repeated in regulations enacted by the U.S. Attorney General pursuant to subsection (b) of <cross_reference>42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 12186</cross_reference>.<sup id=\"ref-fn8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup> In its written response to comments regarding the interplay of the Fair Housing Act<sup id=\"ref-fn9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> and the ADA, the Office of the U.S. Attorney General stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \"[T]he category `places of lodging' would exclude solely residential facilities because <em>the nature of a</em> <em>place of lodging contemplates the use of the facility</em> <em>for short-term stays</em>.</p>\n<p>  \"Many facilities, however, are mixed use facilities. For example, in a large hotel that has a separate residential apartment wing, the residential wing would not be covered by the ADA because of the nature of the occupancy of that part of the facility. This residential wing would, however, be covered by the Fair Housing Act. The separate nonresidential accommodations in the rest of the hotel would be a place of lodging, and thus a public accommodation subject to the requirements of this final rule. If a hotel allows both residential and short-term stays, but does not allocate space for these different uses in separate, discrete units, both the ADA and the Fair Housing Act may apply to the facility.
