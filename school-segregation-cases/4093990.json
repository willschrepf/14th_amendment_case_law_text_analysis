On February 8, 1927, the Port of Seattle granted to the respondent an extension of that lease. On August 22, 1925, the respondent, by written agreement, sublet the above-described property to the appellants. On July 5, 1929, the Port of Seattle notified the respondent that the subletting of any of the property to the appellants was without the consent of the Port, and contrary to the provisions of the agreement \"that this lease shall not be assigned, nor shall the whole or any part of the leased premises be sublet, without the permission of the lessor.\"</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the leasing agreement of respondent with the appellants, the latter were obligated to construct a residence within two years, and improve and develop their property in a suitable manner as residential grounds of their home within a reasonable time.

The court's ruling was correct.</p>\n<p>\"The respondents have moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the question as to the right to possession is at this time a moot one. The respondents in their brief contend that the appellants surrendered possession after the expiration of their supposed one year's extension, to wit, October 31, 1920.

On the contrary, by its implied declarations in the tide land acts, the state has approved such occupancy when taken in good faith prior to the passage of those acts.

In <em>State v. Superior Court</em>, <cross_reference>91 Wn. 454</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>157 P. 1097</cross_reference>, a railway company sought to condemn a waterway in Jefferson county. We held <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 192</span> \nthat a waterway could not be taken for a private use, saying:</p>\n<p>\"As is well known, the state holds title to property in two distinct capacities, the one a proprietary capacity, as individuals generally hold property, and the other a governmental capacity, that is, in trust for the public use. The rule, therefore, is that a statute conferring upon the state or other municipal corporation the general authority to sell, or a statute conferring the right to condemn state or other municipal property generally, will, in the absence of express words to the contrary, be confined to such property as it holds in its proprietary character. This principle we announced in the case of <em>Samish</em><em>Boom Co. v. Callvert</em>, <cross_reference>27 Wn. 611</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>68 P. 367</cross_reference>, in the following language:</p>\n<p>\"`The rule is that, whenever a tract of public land is once legally appropriated to any purpose, from that moment the land thus appropriated becomes severed from the mass of public lands, so that authority to sell in general terms will not be construed to embrace or operate upon it, although no reservation is made of it.'</p>\n<p>\"So, also, in <em>State v. Whitney</em>, <cross_reference>66 Wn. 473</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>120 P. 116</cross_reference>, where we quoted with approval from the case of <em>Wilcox v.</em><em>Jackson</em>, 13 Pet. 498, the following:</p>\n<p>\"`We go further, and say, that whensoever a tract of land shall have once been legally appropriated to any purpose, from that moment the land thus appropriated becomes severed from the mass of public lands; and no subsequent law, or proclamation, or sale, would be construed to embrace, or operate upon it; although no reservation were made of it.'</p>\n<p>\"Indeed, if this be not the rule, the legislature has, by the act in question, granted to railway companies power to condemn any of the state lands for railway purposes (save that of course which is specially exempted), which would include the lands on which its capitol buildings are situated.</p>\n<p>\"Unless the distinction we have suggested counsel intended to make be sound, there can be no question that the water way and the streets in question are among the exempted classes. The first was set apart for a public use in virtue of a statute duly enacted for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 193</span> \nthat purpose, and the other in virtue of the constitution itself. The lands within their boundaries thus become segregated from the general mass of the state's lands which it holds in its proprietary capacity, and become vested in that special class which it holds specially for the public use.\"</p>\n<p>The lease contravenes the public policy of this state, as expressed by positive statute. A tenant is not estopped to deny his landlord's title where the lease, as in the case at bar, is contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p>\"There is one other class of cases, however, where the action is not maintainable, not because of want of title or possession in the lessor, but because by positive statute, or because of public policy, the contract between the parties is unlawful.\"<em>Hall  Paulson Furniture Co. v.

Whitney</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></span></cross_reference>, where we quoted with approval from the case of <em>Wilcox v.</em><em>Jackson</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86113\"><a href=\"/opinion/86113/wilcox-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, the following:</p>\n<p>\"`We go further, and say, that whensoever a tract of land shall have once been legally appropriated to any purpose, from that moment the land thus appropriated becomes severed from the mass of public lands; and no subsequent law, or proclamation, or sale, would be construed to embrace, or operate upon it; although no reservation were made of it.'</p>\n<p>\"Indeed, if this be not the rule, the legislature has, by the act in question, granted to railway companies power to condemn any of the state lands for railway purposes (save that of course which is specially exempted), which would include the lands on which its capitol buildings are situated.</p>\n<p>\"Unless the distinction we have suggested counsel intended to make be sound, there can be no question that the water way and the streets in question are among the exempted classes. The first was set apart for a public use in virtue of a statute duly enacted for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 193</span> \nthat purpose, and the other in virtue of the constitution itself. The lands within their boundaries thus become segregated from the general mass of the state's lands which it holds in its proprietary capacity, and become vested in that special class which it holds specially for the public use.\"</p>\n<p>The lease contravenes the public policy of this state, as expressed by positive statute. A tenant is not estopped to deny his landlord's title where the lease, as in the case at bar, is contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p>\"There is one other class of cases, however, where the action is not maintainable, not because of want of title or possession in the lessor, but because by positive statute, or because of public policy, the contract between the parties is unlawful.\"<em>Hall  Paulson Furniture Co. v. Wilbur</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span></cross_reference>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></span></cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p>BEALS, FULLERTON, PARKER, and MITCHELL, JJ., concur. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 194</span> </p>",
