He challenges the\r\ntrial court's characterization of five accounts as Betty Huval's separate property.<sup> (1)</sup></span><span>  Finding\r\nno reversible error, we affirm the trial court's judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLouis and Betty were married in 1950.  During the marriage, Betty inherited six acres\r\nof land in Louisiana.  The land was subdivided into eleven lots, and Betty sold the lots during\r\na twenty-year period.  She received $228,467 from the sales.  The court awarded Betty five\r\nbank accounts worth approximately $228,447 as separate property reimbursement.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLouis brings four issues on appeal.  In issue one, Louis argues Betty failed to establish\r\nby clear and convincing evidence that the money in the five accounts was her separate\r\nproperty.  In issues two, three, and four, Louis contends Betty's testimony at trial is\r\ninsufficient to rebut the community property presumption, the court erred by not admitting\r\ninto evidence the bank records Betty offered as exhibits, and the Huvals' funds were\r\ncommingled.  Essentially, Louis argues in all four issues that the bank accounts the trial court\r\nawarded to Betty were mischaracterized as her separate property.<sup> (2)</sup></span><span> </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the time of the Huvals' divorce, the marital estate included eleven certificates of\r\ndeposit, two individual retirement accounts, and two checking accounts.<sup> (3)</sup>  The court\r\nrecognized each party's separate property claims by awarding two certificates of deposit and\r\nan annuity plan to Louis as his separate property, and awarding to Betty four certificates of\r\ndeposit and an individual retirement account opened in her name.  Louis does not challenge\r\nthe amount the court awarded him as separate property, or the award of any accounts as a\r\ndivision of community property.  The issue he raises is whether the trial court\r\nmischaracterized community property as Betty's separate property.  If the trial court\r\nmischaracterized the property, we must determine whether the mischaracterization was of\r\nsuch magnitude as to require that we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a new\r\ndivision of the property.  <em>See Tate v. Tate</em>, 55 S.W.3d 1, 11 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2000, no\r\npet.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Texas Family Code provides that \"[p]roperty possessed by either spouse during\r\nor on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\r\n§ 3.003(a) (Vernon 2006).  To overcome this presumption, a party must present clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that the property is the party's separate property.  <em>Id.</em> § 3.003(b).  Clear\r\nand convincing evidence is that \"measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind\r\nof the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be\r\nestablished.\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 101.007 (Vernon 2002).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe \"party asserting separate ownership must clearly trace the original separate\r\nproperty into the particular assets on hand at the dissolution of marriage.\"  <em>Martin v. Martin</em>,\r\n759 S.W.2d 463, 466 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ).<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>  </span><span>\"Tracing involves\r\nestablishing the separate origin of the property through evidence showing the time and means\r\nby which the spouse originally obtained possession of the property.\"  <em>Boyd v. Boyd</em>, 131\r\nS.W.3d 605, 612 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2004, no pet.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBetty relies on the community-out-first presumption.  If there are sufficient funds in\r\na joint bank account to cover a party's separate estate after community funds are withdrawn,\r\nthe balance may be presumed to be the party's separate funds.  <em>See Sibley v. Sibley</em>, 286\r\nS.W.2d 657, 659 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1955, writ dism'd) (applying the presumption and\r\nawarding the balance as separate property).  Furthermore, under another tracing method,\r\nwhen the value of a deposit of separate property can be identified, and the withdrawals are\r\nidentifiable, separate property will remain in the account if the balance never decreases\r\nbelow the value of the separate property deposit.  <em>See generally Snider v. Snider, </em>613 S.W.2d\r\n8, 11 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1981, no writ) (</span><span>awarding husband separate property in savings\r\naccount after determining that interest earned, deposits, and withdrawals never reduced\r\naccount balance to or below husband's identifiable separate interest</span><span>). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMarital property may be mixed property, consisting of part separate property and part\r\ncommunity property in proportion to the amount of separate and community property.  <em>See\r\ngenerally Gleich v. Bongio,</em> 99 S.W.2d 881, 883 (Tex. 1937) (</span><span>holding that property\r\npurchased partly with community funds and partly with separate funds has the effect of\r\ncreating a tenancy in common between the separate and community estates with each estate\r\nowning an interest in the proportion that it supplied the funds</span><span>).  </span><span>\"A showing that community\r\nand separate funds were deposited in the same account does not divest the separate funds of\r\ntheir identity and establish the entire amount as community when the separate funds may be\r\ntraced and the trial court is able to determine accurately the interest of each party.</span><span>\"  <em>Welder\r\nv. Welder</em>, 794 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1990, no writ).  There is no\r\ncommingling by the mixing of dollars when the amount owned by each claimant is known. \r\n<em>Id.</em>  When separate and community funds are commingled in a manner that defies\r\nsegregation, the entire commingled fund is presumed to consist of community property. \r\n<em>Boyd</em>, 131 S.W.3d at 612.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is undisputed that Betty inherited the six acres of land.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span>  </span><span>Betty presented evidence\r\nthat she received approximately $228,467 from the sale of the eleven lots, including $13,000\r\nfrom the first sale.  The sale proceeds that remain are her separate property.  <em>See Martin</em>, 759\r\nS.W.2d at 466.  She spent the money received from the first sale on living expenses and on\r\nthe children's schooling.  That amount no longer remained in the marital estate when the\r\nmarriage was dissolved and, generally, there is no right to reimbursement when separate\r\nfunds are spent on normal community living expenses.  <em>See In re Marriage of Case</em>, 28\r\nS.W.3d 154, 161 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2000, no pet).  Betty testified, however, that except\r\nfor the money received from the first sale, the Huvals used the sales proceeds from the\r\nremaining lots to purchase certificates of deposit, and spent the interest from the certificates\r\nof deposit on living expenses.  Betty indicated that by depositing the sales proceeds in the\r\naccounts, she did not intend to make a gift of half her inheritance to Louis, but rather\r\nintended for her children to inherit the money from her. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBetty's testimony indicates that her separate property remained in the marital estate\r\nat the time of the divorce. Betty identified the five bank accounts that held her separate\r\nproperty.  She testified regarding three of the accounts held at Bank One as follows: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's Counsel]: Now, there was one piece of property that you sold in 1977;\r\nbut most of the property after that was sold between 1985 and 1998; do you\r\nremember that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Betty]: Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tOkay.  And all of that money, that's what you used with Mr. Huval to\r\nput into these banks to open these CDs; is that correct?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tThat is correct . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tOkay.  But when you took this money from the sale of your property,\r\nand you put it in these CDs, these CDs were paying you money every\r\nmonth; weren't they?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tYes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tThat's what you and Mr. Huval and your children were using to live\r\non?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tAnd . . . we'd keep building it up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tSo, most if not all the money that you received from the sale of these\r\nlots is still in these accounts with Bank One?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tYes, sir, it is. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Betty further indicated that a South Trust bank account also contained her sales proceeds and\r\na Washington Mutual account was an individual retirement account opened in her name.  The\r\ntrial court awarded Betty these five bank accounts as her separate property.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLouis indicated that the Huvals used the sales proceeds and his personal injury\r\nsettlement checks to purchase certificates of deposit.  Although Betty testified that the five\r\naccounts contained her sales proceeds, Louis could not identify the source of the funds in any\r\nindividual certificate of deposit.  He testified the Huvals lived off the interest in the\r\ncertificates of deposit and sometimes purchased additional certificates of deposit.  Louis\r\ncould not identify which certificates of deposit retained accumulated interest and which\r\ncertificates of deposit had the interest withdrawn. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLinda Dubose, the Huvals' daughter, testified that Betty inherited the Louisiana \r\nproperty, and that the property was subdivided into eleven lots.  Linda testified that the lots\r\nwere sold over a period of time and the sales proceeds were put into certificates of deposit. \r\nShe testified her parents lived off the interest earned on the certificates of deposit, and the\r\nmoney in the certificates of deposit had accumulated over a twenty-year period.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGenerally, documents such as bank records are used to corroborate a spouse's\r\ntestimony that property is the spouse's separate property.  <em>See Osorno v. Osorno</em>, 76 S.W.3d\r\n509, 512 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.); <em>Purser v. Purser</em>, 604 S.W.2d 411,\r\n413 (Tex. Civ. App.--Texarkana 1980, no writ).  Here, the real estate sales documents\r\ncorroborated Betty's testimony as to the amount of the sale proceeds she received from\r\nselling the property.  She apparently also consulted bank records during her testimony,\r\nalthough the trial court did not admit the records into evidence.  At the conclusion of Betty's\r\ntestimony, the following exchange occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: I can introduce the bank records, Your Honor.  They were\r\nmerely to refresh her memory; but I can do that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[The Court]: Not necessary for me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: I've given counsel a copy of those bank records, Your\r\nHonor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tJune 7, 2007[The Court]: Okay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: I think the Court had the figures.  We testified from it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Louis did not object to the trial court's statement that offering the referenced bank records\r\nas evidence was \"[n]ot necessary for me.\"  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).  The record reflects\r\nLouis had a copy of the records.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Evid. 612.  Louis did not offer the records as\r\nevidence.  He now complains for the first time on appeal that the court erred \"in stating on\r\nthe record that it did not need the banking records of Betty.\"  Because Louis did not preserve\r\nany other objection at trial, we understand this argument to be a challenge to the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence, which in a non-jury case may be made for the first time on appeal.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nR. App. P. 33.1(d).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to Betty's testimony and the records referenced, the trial court heard\r\ntestimony from the Huvals' daughter.  A reasonable conclusion from Betty's testimony,\r\ncorroborated by the sales documents before the trial court and Linda Dubose's testimony, is\r\nthat the Huvals used Betty's separate property to purchase certificates of deposit, and Betty's\r\nseparate property remained in the certificates of deposit when the marriage was dissolved,\r\nwith the exception of the proceeds from the first sale.  The money did not lose its separate\r\ncharacter by being placed in the certificates of deposit.  <em>See generally Newland v. Newland,\r\n</em>529 S.W.2d 105, 107 (Tex. Civ. App.--Fort Worth 1975, writ dism'd) (</span><span>stating that property\r\npurchased with separate funds becomes the separate property of party whose separate funds\r\nwere expended).</span><span>  Louis argues that Betty's testimony was in response to leading questions,\r\nbut he objected on that basis to only one question at trial.  The judge as trier of fact could\r\nassess the credibility of the witnesses.  <em>See Zagorski v. Zagorski, </em>116 S.W.3d 309, 318 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).  On this record, the trial court could\r\nreasonably form a firm belief or conviction that $215,467 of Betty's separate property\r\nremained when the marriage was dissolved.  </span><span>The trial court awarded Betty approximately\r\n$228,447 as her separate property reimbursement. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder the circumstances of this case, the difference in the $228,447 awarded and the\r\n$215,467 proven to be Betty's separate property is not of such magnitude as to require a\r\nreversal of the trial court's division of the property. </span><span> In a divorce decree, a trial court \"shall\r\norder a division of the estate of the parties in a manner that the court deems just and right,\r\nhaving due regard for the rights of each party and any children of the marriage.\"  Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann. § 7.001 (Vernon 2006).  An appellate court reviews a trial court's division of\r\nproperty for an abuse of discretion.  <em>Boyd</em>, 131 S.W.3d at 610 (citing <em>Jacobs v. Jacobs,</em> 687\r\nS.W.2d 731, 733 (Tex. 1985)).  A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts without\r\nreference to any guiding rules or principles.  <em>Id.</em>  In <em>Tate, </em>the court explained that when\r\nconsidering a claim that community property has been improperly characterized as separate\r\nproperty, \"[i]t is only when the court mistakenly characterizes property that is of such\r\nmagnitude that it materially affects the just and right division of the community estate that\r\nreversible error is demonstrated.\"  <em>Tate,</em> 55 S.W.3d at 11.  The <em>Tate </em>court found an asserted\r\ncharacterization error that amounted to 8.5 percent of the estate was not harmful error under\r\nthe circumstances.  <em>Id.</em> at 10, 12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the trial court awarded Betty a larger portion of the community estate. \r\nCourts have considered a number of factors that may justify a disproportionate division.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nat 10.  Some of the relevant factors in the court's division of property are the spouses' ages,\r\nrelative physical conditions, the size of separate estates, and any disparity in earning\r\ncapacities and incomes.  <em>Murff v. Murff</em>, 615 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Tex. 1981). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWithout the benefit of findings of fact, Louis cannot establish the factors the trial\r\ncourt considered in determining the division of property.  <em>See Tate</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 10.  There\r\nare several factors the court may have considered in this case.  The Huvals had reached\r\nretirement age at the time of the divorce.  Louis suffered from heart problems and asbestosis,\r\nand Betty had suffered from cancer.  During much of the marriage, Louis was the only\r\nspouse employed outside of the home.  Betty testified as follows concerning the Huvals'\r\nincome at the time of divorce:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: Mrs. Huval, if I told you that according to the temporary\r\norders, you were given $1114 to live on, would you think that's pretty close?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Betty]:  Yes, sir, that sounds about right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tBecause you got the $358 [from] your social security check?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tAnd the CDs.  Some months there [was] a little less than other[s].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tAnd you got the three checks from the three CDs at Bank One?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tAt Bank One, yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tAnd all that every month added up to about [$]1100.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tYes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tAnd Mr. Huval got $1749 every month; didn't he?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tYes, sir, he did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tThat's his pension check and his social security?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tUh-huh.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tIs that right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tYes, sir.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Louis withdrew at least $75,000 in cash near the time he filed for divorce.  Betty testified that\r\nduring the separation, she paid the utilities for the lake camp Louis moved to when he left\r\nthe house, the utilities for the house,  Louis's medical insurance, and quarterly payments of\r\n$1,500 to the IRS for income taxes.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court has broad discretion in dividing the property on divorce.  <em>Id. </em>at 12.  The\r\ntrial court did not err in characterizing $215,467 as Betty's separate property.  The trial court\r\nawarded Betty five accounts worth $228,447 as her separate property.  On this record, the\r\ndifference between the amount proven to be Betty's  separate property at the time of divorce\r\nand the amount awarded as her separate property is not so substantial as to require the\r\nreversal of the trial court's judgment for a new property division.  The record contains\r\nsufficient evidence justifying a disproportionate division of the community property, and in\r\nthe absence of findings of fact and conclusions of law, Louis cannot show that the trial court\r\nwould divide the total community property differently.  Louis has not demonstrated that a\r\ndivision of the property caused by a characterization error resulted in so substantial a\r\ndisparity as to constitute an abuse of discretion, and therefore has not shown error requiring\r\na reversal of the trial court's judgment.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 10-12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule appellant's four issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAFFIRMED. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t____________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDAVID GAULTNEY</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Submitted on January 25, 2007</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Opinion Delivered June 21, 2007 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Before McKeithen, C.J., Gaultney and Horton, JJ.\r\n<p>1.

As the\r\ntrier of fact, the trial judge may have rejected his testimony as not credible.  It is also possible\r\nthe trial court recognized this reimbursement claim in the amount awarded as separate\r\nproperty to Louis, because the record does not include separate findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

He challenges the\r\ntrial court's characterization of five accounts as Betty Huval's separate property.<sup> (1)</sup></span><span>  Finding\r\nno reversible error, we affirm the trial court's judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLouis and Betty were married in 1950.  During the marriage, Betty inherited six acres\r\nof land in Louisiana.  The land was subdivided into eleven lots, and Betty sold the lots during\r\na twenty-year period.  She received $228,467 from the sales.  The court awarded Betty five\r\nbank accounts worth approximately $228,447 as separate property reimbursement.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLouis brings four issues on appeal.  In issue one, Louis argues Betty failed to establish\r\nby clear and convincing evidence that the money in the five accounts was her separate\r\nproperty.  In issues two, three, and four, Louis contends Betty's testimony at trial is\r\ninsufficient to rebut the community property presumption, the court erred by not admitting\r\ninto evidence the bank records Betty offered as exhibits, and the Huvals' funds were\r\ncommingled.  Essentially, Louis argues in all four issues that the bank accounts the trial court\r\nawarded to Betty were mischaracterized as her separate property.<sup> (2)</sup></span><span> </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the time of the Huvals' divorce, the marital estate included eleven certificates of\r\ndeposit, two individual retirement accounts, and two checking accounts.<sup> (3)</sup>  The court\r\nrecognized each party's separate property claims by awarding two certificates of deposit and\r\nan annuity plan to Louis as his separate property, and awarding to Betty four certificates of\r\ndeposit and an individual retirement account opened in her name.  Louis does not challenge\r\nthe amount the court awarded him as separate property, or the award of any accounts as a\r\ndivision of community property.  The issue he raises is whether the trial court\r\nmischaracterized community property as Betty's separate property.  If the trial court\r\nmischaracterized the property, we must determine whether the mischaracterization was of\r\nsuch magnitude as to require that we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a new\r\ndivision of the property.  <em>See Tate v.

The sale proceeds that remain are her separate property.  <em>See Martin</em>, 759\r\nS.W.2d at 466.  She spent the money received from the first sale on living expenses and on\r\nthe children's schooling.  That amount no longer remained in the marital estate when the\r\nmarriage was dissolved and, generally, there is no right to reimbursement when separate\r\nfunds are spent on normal community living expenses.  <em>See In re Marriage of Case</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755577/in-re-marriage-of-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 161 (Tex.

Betty testified, however, that except\r\nfor the money received from the first sale, the Huvals used the sales proceeds from the\r\nremaining lots to purchase certificates of deposit, and spent the interest from the certificates\r\nof deposit on living expenses.  Betty indicated that by depositing the sales proceeds in the\r\naccounts, she did not intend to make a gift of half her inheritance to Louis, but rather\r\nintended for her children to inherit the money from her. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBetty's testimony indicates that her separate property remained in the marital estate\r\nat the time of the divorce. Betty identified the five bank accounts that held her separate\r\nproperty.  She testified regarding three of the accounts held at Bank One as follows: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's Counsel]: Now, there was one piece of property that you sold in 1977;\r\nbut most of the property after that was sold between 1985 and 1998; do you\r\nremember that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Betty]: Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tOkay.

But when you took this money from the sale of your property,\r\nand you put it in these CDs, these CDs were paying you money every\r\nmonth; weren't they?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tYes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tThat's what you and Mr. Huval and your children were using to live\r\non?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tAnd . . . we'd keep building it up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ:\tSo, most if not all the money that you received from the sale of these\r\nlots is still in these accounts with Bank One?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA:\tYes, sir, it is. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Betty further indicated that a South Trust bank account also contained her sales proceeds and\r\na Washington Mutual account was an individual retirement account opened in her name.  The\r\ntrial court awarded Betty these five bank accounts as her separate property.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLouis indicated that the Huvals used the sales proceeds and his personal injury\r\nsettlement checks to purchase certificates of deposit.  Although Betty testified that the five\r\naccounts contained her sales proceeds, Louis could not identify the source of the funds in any\r\nindividual certificate of deposit.  He testified the Huvals lived off the interest in the\r\ncertificates of deposit and sometimes purchased additional certificates of deposit.  Louis\r\ncould not identify which certificates of deposit retained accumulated interest and which\r\ncertificates of deposit had the interest withdrawn. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLinda Dubose, the Huvals' daughter, testified that Betty inherited the Louisiana \r\nproperty, and that the property was subdivided into eleven lots.  Linda testified that the lots\r\nwere sold over a period of time and the sales proceeds were put into certificates of deposit. \r\nShe testified her parents lived off the interest earned on the certificates of deposit, and the\r\nmoney in the certificates of deposit had accumulated over a twenty-year period.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGenerally, documents such as bank records are used to corroborate a spouse's\r\ntestimony that property is the spouse's separate property.  <em>See Osorno v. Osorno</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335057\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335057/osorno-v-osorno/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 512 (Tex.

Civ. App.--Texarkana 1980, no writ).  Here, the real estate sales documents\r\ncorroborated Betty's testimony as to the amount of the sale proceeds she received from\r\nselling the property.  She apparently also consulted bank records during her testimony,\r\nalthough the trial court did not admit the records into evidence.  At the conclusion of Betty's\r\ntestimony, the following exchange occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: I can introduce the bank records, Your Honor.  They were\r\nmerely to refresh her memory; but I can do that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[The Court]: Not necessary for me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: I've given counsel a copy of those bank records, Your\r\nHonor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tJune 7, 2007[The Court]: Okay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: I think the Court had the figures.  We testified from it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Louis did not object to the trial court's statement that offering the referenced bank records\r\nas evidence was \"[n]ot necessary for me.\"  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).  The record reflects\r\nLouis had a copy of the records.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Evid. 612.  Louis did not offer the records as\r\nevidence.  He now complains for the first time on appeal that the court erred \"in stating on\r\nthe record that it did not need the banking records of Betty.\"  Because Louis did not preserve\r\nany other objection at trial, we understand this argument to be a challenge to the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence, which in a non-jury case may be made for the first time on appeal.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nR. App. P. 33.1(d).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to Betty's testimony and the records referenced, the trial court heard\r\ntestimony from the Huvals' daughter.  A reasonable conclusion from Betty's testimony,\r\ncorroborated by the sales documents before the trial court and Linda Dubose's testimony, is\r\nthat the Huvals used Betty's separate property to purchase certificates of deposit, and Betty's\r\nseparate property remained in the certificates of deposit when the marriage was dissolved,\r\nwith the exception of the proceeds from the first sale.  The money did not lose its separate\r\ncharacter by being placed in the certificates of deposit.  <em>See generally Newland v.

A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts without\r\nreference to any guiding rules or principles.  <em>Id.</em>  In <em>Tate, </em>the court explained that when\r\nconsidering a claim that community property has been improperly characterized as separate\r\nproperty, \"[i]t is only when the court mistakenly characterizes property that is of such\r\nmagnitude that it materially affects the just and right division of the community estate that\r\nreversible error is demonstrated.\"  <em>Tate,</em> 55 S.W.3d at 11.  The <em>Tate </em>court found an asserted\r\ncharacterization error that amounted to 8.5 percent of the estate was not harmful error under\r\nthe circumstances.  <em>Id.</em> at 10, 12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the trial court awarded Betty a larger portion of the community estate. \r\nCourts have considered a number of factors that may justify a disproportionate division.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nat 10.

There\r\nare several factors the court may have considered in this case.  The Huvals had reached\r\nretirement age at the time of the divorce.  Louis suffered from heart problems and asbestosis,\r\nand Betty had suffered from cancer.  During much of the marriage, Louis was the only\r\nspouse employed outside of the home.  Betty testified as follows concerning the Huvals'\r\nincome at the time of divorce:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Louis's counsel]: Mrs. Huval, if I told you that according to the temporary\r\norders, you were given $1114 to live on, would you think that's pretty close?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Betty]:  Yes, sir, that sounds about right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tBecause you got the $358 [from] your social security check?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tAnd the CDs.  Some months there [was] a little less than other[s].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tAnd you got the three checks from the three CDs at Bank One?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tAt Bank One, yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tAnd all that every month added up to about [$]1100.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tYes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tAnd Mr. Huval got $1749 every month; didn't he?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tYes, sir, he did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tThat's his pension check and his social security?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tUh-huh.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ: \tIs that right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA: \tYes, sir.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Louis withdrew at least $75,000 in cash near the time he filed for divorce.  Betty testified that\r\nduring the separation, she paid the utilities for the lake camp Louis moved to when he left\r\nthe house, the utilities for the house,  Louis's medical insurance, and quarterly payments of\r\n$1,500 to the IRS for income taxes.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court has broad discretion in dividing the property on divorce.  <em>Id. </em>at 12.  The\r\ntrial court did not err in characterizing $215,467 as Betty's separate property.  The trial court\r\nawarded Betty five accounts worth $228,447 as her separate property.  On this record, the\r\ndifference between the amount proven to be Betty's  separate property at the time of divorce\r\nand the amount awarded as her separate property is not so substantial as to require the\r\nreversal of the trial court's judgment for a new property division.  The record contains\r\nsufficient evidence justifying a disproportionate division of the community property, and in\r\nthe absence of findings of fact and conclusions of law, Louis cannot show that the trial court\r\nwould divide the total community property differently.  Louis has not demonstrated that a\r\ndivision of the property caused by a characterization error resulted in so substantial a\r\ndisparity as to constitute an abuse of discretion, and therefore has not shown error requiring\r\na reversal of the trial court's judgment.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 10-12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule appellant's four issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAFFIRMED. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t____________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDAVID GAULTNEY</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Submitted on January 25, 2007</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Opinion Delivered June 21, 2007 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Before McKeithen, C.J., Gaultney and Horton, JJ.\r\n<p>1. Although the court awarded the accounts to Betty as \"reimbursement,\" Louis does\r\nnot attack the court's characterization of the separate property claim in this manner.  <em>See\r\ngenerally Vallone v. Vallone, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456272\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456272/vallone-v-vallone/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 458 (Tex. 1982) (\"Questions concerning the\r\nright to reimbursement do not concern which estate owns legal or equitable title in certain\r\nproperty.\");<em> Garcia v.

During the marriage, Louis received\r\nvarious cash settlements as a result of job-related injuries and asbestosis, and the trial court\r\nawarded certain bank accounts as his separate property.</span><span> \r\n<p>4. </p></span><span>Under Texas law, property acquired by inheritance is separate property.  Tex. Const.\r\nart. XVI, § 15; Tex. Fam Code Ann. § 3.001(2) (Vernon 2006).  </span><span>The law of the situs\r\ncontrols as to the land.  <em>Kaherl v.

Code Ann. art. 2341 (2007).</span><span> </span><span>The proceeds from the sale of the eleven lots\r\nwere Betty's separate property.  <em>See Martin, </em>759 S.W.2d at 466 (</span><span>stating that the proceeds\r\nfrom the sale of separate property remain separate property</span><span>).\r\n<p>5. Under Texas law, improvements made to real property are given the same character\r\nas the real property in the division of the marital estate.  <em>See In re Marriage of Morris, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1586690\"><a href=\"/opinion/1586690/in-re-marriage-of-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span>, 881-82 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2000, no pet.).  This is true because generally\r\nimprovements made on the property become part of the real estate and are considered the\r\nproperty of the real estate owner. <em> See</em> <em>id.</em>; <em>Foxworth-Galbraith Lumber Co. v. Thorp, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3967820\"><a href=\"/opinion/4197190/foxworth-galbraith-lumber-v-thorp/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 644-66 (Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1935, no writ).  Louis has not shown that\r\nLouisiana law treats improvements to realty differently.  A marital estate may have a right\r\nto reimbursement or economic contribution.  <em>See </em>Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(a),(b);\r\n<em>Dakan v. Dakan,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3980387\"><a href=\"/opinion/4208273/dakan-v-dakan/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3980387\"><a href=\"/opinion/4208273/dakan-v-dakan/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 628 (1935). </p></span><span> The party asserting claims for\r\nreimbursement or economic contribution must plead and prove the claims.  </span><span><em>See Garza v.\r\nGarza</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1505419\"><a href=\"/opinion/1505419/garza-v-garza/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 546 (Tex.

App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.)\r\n(party did not plead economic contribution)</span><span>.  Although neither party filed a pleading\r\nrequesting reimbursement or economic contribution with the trial court, Louis provided\r\ntestimony that the community expended funds to improve Betty's separate property.  As the\r\ntrier of fact, the trial judge may have rejected his testimony as not credible.  It is also possible\r\nthe trial court recognized this reimbursement claim in the amount awarded as separate\r\nproperty to Louis, because the record does not include separate findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
