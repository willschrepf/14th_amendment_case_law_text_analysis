SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n     In this appeal of an order denying intervention, the movants are parents\n\f    Case: 13-31262     Document: 00512591800      Page: 2   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\nwhose children receive school vouchers via Louisiana’s Scholarship Program.\nThe legislature established the Program in 2012 to provide funding to low-\nincome parents with children in failing schools so that they may have the\noption of sending them to better schools, including private schools, of their own\nchoosing. LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 17:4013. The parents seek to intervene in this\nlitigation between Louisiana and the federal government over the state’s\nvoucher program. We reverse the order denying intervention.\n\n\n                                            I.\n      On August 22, 2013, the United States filed a motion seeking “perman-\nently [to] enjoin the State of Louisiana . . . from awarding any school vouchers\n. . . to students attending school in districts operating under federal desegre-\ngation orders unless and until the State receives authorization from the appro-\npriate federal court overseeing the applicable desegregation case.” This case,\nas reflected in the caption, involves the desegregation order issued in Brum-\nfield v. Dodd, 405 F. Supp. 338 (E.D. La. 1975) (three-judge court), which pro-\nhibited the provision of public funds or other assistance “to any racially dis-\ncriminatory private school or to any racially segregated private school” and\ncreated a certification process to establish private-school eligibility for receiv-\ning public funds. Id. at 349.\n      The United States initially sought the injunction on the ground that the\nvoucher program constituted public assistance to private schools in violation\nof the desegregation order: “The State’s actions in using public funds to trans-\nfer students in districts operating under desegregation orders to schools which\nthey are not zoned to attend,” argued the government, “cause irreparable\ninjury to the court-ordered desegregation process, the parties to the desegre-\ngation action, and ultimately to the students and the communities governed by\nthe desegregation decree.” The government further urged that the program\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 13-31262     Document: 00512591800      Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\n“deprives the students of their right to a desegregated educational experience.”\n      The parents moved to intervene as a matter of right for the limited pur-\npose of opposing the motion for permanent injunction. The United States, how-\never, claims that on September 23, 2013, it had informed the court that,\n      in light of the information already provided by the State and the\n      information the court had ordered the State to produce, the only\n      relief the United States now sought was the creation of a process\n      under which the State would provide the information needed to\n      assess and monitor the voucher program’s implementation consis-\n      tent with the orders in this case on a regular and timely basis.\n\nTherefore, according to the United States, it no longer sought the relief\nrequested in its August motion, and the intervention motion did not explain\n“how [the parents’] interests could be affected by the relief now being sought.”\n      The district court agreed with the United States and denied interven-\ntion. “Because the Motion that Proposed Intervenors sought to oppose no\nlonger requests the remedy Proposed Intervenors objected to,” the court held,\n“they lack the necessary interest to intervene. The only remaining issues in\nthe case, at this time, [a]ffect the sharing of information between the United\nStates and the State of Louisiana. These issues simply do not [a]ffect the inter-\nests of Proposed Intervenors.” The district court did allow for the possibility of\na renewed intervention motion should the United States seek its original relief.\n\n\n                                            II.\n      A court “must permit anyone to intervene who . . . claims an interest\nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is\nso situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or\nimpede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties ade-\nquately represent that interest.” FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a). A party seeking to\nintervene as of right must satisfy four requirements:\n\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 13-31262       Document: 00512591800    Page: 4   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\n      (1) The application must be timely; (2) the applicant must have an\n      interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject\n      of the action; (3) the applicant must be so situated that the dispo-\n      sition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede its\n      ability to protect its interest; and (4) the applicant’s interest must\n      be inadequately represented by the existing parties to the suit.\n\nSierra Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1204–05 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing New Orleans\nPub. Serv., Inc. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co. (“NOPSI”), 732 F.2d 452, 463 (5th\nCir. 1984) (en banc)).\n      Although the movant bears the burden of establishing its right to inter-\nvene, Rule 24 is to be liberally construed. 6 JAMES W. MOORE ET AL., MOORE’S\nFEDERAL PRACTICE [hereinafter MOORE’S] § 24.03[1][a], at 24-22 (3d ed. 2008);\nIn re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig., 570 F.3d 244, 248 (5th Cir. 2009). The inquiry\n“is a flexible one, and a practical analysis of the facts and circumstances of each\ncase is appropriate.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.01[1][a], at 24-24; Edwards v. City of\nHous., 78 F.3d 983, 999 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc). We review a denial of a right\nto intervene de novo. Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1205.\n\n\n                                       III.\n      Because timeliness is not at issue, we address only the other three\nprongs. Before doing so, however, we address a material factual dispute.\n\n\n                                        A.\n      The United States contends that the parents do not have an interest in\nthis litigation—and that if they do, it is not likely to be impaired—because they\nhave not explained how the new relief the government seeks involves or\nimpairs any interest of the parents. The government also maintains that the\nparents’ arguments as to interest and impairment are therefore waived\nbecause they were not presented to the district court. In other words, the\n\n                                        4\n\f    Case: 13-31262    Document: 00512591800     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 13-31262\ngovernment hinges its argument respecting these prongs almost entirely on its\nclaim that it is no longer seeking the relief it previously sought in its August\nmotion. We now explore that claim.\n      As previously discussed, in that motion the government sought a per-\nmanent injunction of the voucher program “unless and until the State receives\nauthorization from the appropriate federal court overseeing the applicable\ndesegregation case.” The district court issued an order on September 18 that\nprompted the United States to supplement its initial August motion.         The\nUnited States claims that as a result of that order, the three objectives of its\nAugust motion “are now in the process of being fulfilled” because the state has\nagreed to provide, to the government, data on the voucher program.\n      As the government states in its supplemental motion, however, the\nSeptember 18 order required the parties to brief and argue two legal issues:\nwhether the desegregation order applies to the Scholarship Program, and if so,\nwhether there is any need to amend existing orders. Significantly, in its sup-\nplemental motion the United States rephrased the district court’s first question\nas follows: “(1) [D]oes the desegregation order issued in Brumfield apply to the\nVoucher Program so as to require the State to obtain authorization from the\nCourt prior to implementation?” The government then stated, “To the extent\nthis Court determines it appropriate to resolve those two questions in the\naffirmative, and a schedule is put in place to facilitate compliance and the\ntimely sharing of school voucher program data and analysis by Louisiana as\nrequested by the United States, it is the position of the United States that the\nrelief sought by the August Motion will have been satisfied.”\n      It is not credible for the United States to claim that the relief it is now\nseeking differs from the relief the parents opposed in the August motion, in\nwhich it sought to enjoin the program unless and until the State receives\nauthorization from the appropriate federal court overseeing the applicable\n                                       5\n\f     Case: 13-31262      Document: 00512591800         Page: 6    Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-31262\ndesegregation case. In the supplemental motion, the government explains that\nto the extent that the Court affirmatively answers the first question, it believes\nthe goal of its prior motion has been satisfied. But an affirmative answer to\nthe first question as rephrased by the government would be “the desegregation\norder applies” and so “the state requires authorization from the court prior to\nimplementation.” There is no real difference between that relief and the relief\npreviously sought. Both would demand an injunction unless and until the state\nobtained court authorization. 1\n\n\n                                            B.\n                                            1.\n       For intervention, a movant’s interest must be “direct, substantial, and\nlegally protectable.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.01[2][a], at 24-25; Edwards, 78 F.3d at\n1004; Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1207. This court several times has found inter-\nests remarkably similar to the interest of the parents here to be sufficient.\n       In Black Fire Fighters Ass’n of Dallas v. City of Dallas, Texas, 19 F.3d\n992, 994 (5th Cir. 1994), the city entered into a consent decree with an\nemployee group, agreeing to give a specified number of promotions to black\nofficers who would not otherwise be chosen because of their scores on an exam.\nThe association challenged the intervention of a different group of firefighters.\nWe held that “[a] decree’s prospective interference with promotion opportuni-\nties can justify intervention.” Id. In Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1207, we held that\nlumber companies had an interest sufficient for intervention because their\n“existing timber contracts” were “threatened by” an injunction potentially\n\n\n\n       1 Therefore, to the extent the government suggests that the parents have waived their\ncontentions because they failed to raise any arguments with respect to the purportedly dif-\nferent relief sought, we disagree.\n                                             6\n\f    Case: 13-31262     Document: 00512591800      Page: 7   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\nprohibiting the Forest Service from selling certain timber.\n      In Edwards, our en banc court reversed a denial of intervention on\ngrounds similar to those in Black Fire Fighters. There, the police department\nhad entered into a consent decree with black and Hispanic officers; the district\ncourt had denied intervention by a group of white, female, and Asian-American\nofficers. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 989. The main complaint of that group was “that\nthe Consent Decree adversely affects the interests of its members in having\nequal access to a promotion system and promotion opportunities within the\n[department] for the ranks of Sergeant and Lieutenant without reference to\nrace, color, or national origin.” Id. at 1004. We held that that complaint stated\na sufficient interest for intervention.\n      Here, a potential decree—an amendment to the original decree in this\naction from 1975—similarly threatens a “prospective interference with” educa-\ntional opportunities. Further, any decree might “adversely affect[] the inter-\nests of [the parents] in having equal access to . . . opportunities . . . without\nreference to race, color, or national origin.” Finally, “existing” scholarships are\n“threatened by” a potential bar on certain kinds of vouchers. The United States\npoints to United States v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 (5th\nCir. 1978), for the proposition that this court has found that parents do not\nhave a sufficient interest to intervene in desegregation proceedings.         The\nparents challenge the very premise that the Scholarship Program is subject to\nany such proceedings. Even so, an old desegregation case involving a policy\ndispute over the location of a newly built school, see Perry, 567 F.2d at 279–80,\nis far less apposite than are Sierra Club, Edwards, and Black Fire Fighters.\n      To be sure, the United States is claiming that, at the moment, it has no\nintention of halting the voucher program or depriving anyone of an existing\nscholarship. Yet, if a modification of the decree requiring court approval means\nanything, it signifies that the government will have the ability to attempt to\n                                          7\n\f    Case: 13-31262     Document: 00512591800     Page: 8   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\nadjust some element of the Scholarship Program—either by changing which\nstudents receive the aid or changing the schools in which they are placed—if\nnot to urge that the program be killed entirely. The possibility is therefore real\nthat if the parents are not able adequately to protect their interests, some\nstudents who otherwise would get vouchers might not get them or might not\nget to select a particular school they otherwise would choose. The parents need\nnot wait to see whether that ultimately happens; they have already described\nan interest justifying intervention.\n      The public interest easily supports intervention: “The interest require-\nment may be judged by a more lenient standard if the case involves a public\ninterest question or is brought by a public interest group. The zone of interests\nprotected by a constitutional provision or statute of general application is argu-\nably broader than are the protectable interests recognized in other contexts.”\n6 MOORE’S § 24.03[2][c], at 24-34 (citing NOPSI, 732 F.2d at 464–65). Our\nen banc court has explained that a zone-of-interest analysis in standing doc-\ntrine can bear on the interest question for purposes of intervention. NOPSI,\n732 F.2d at 464–65.\n      The purported aim of the United States is to enforce the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. If any group can be described as within\nthe zone of interest protected by that clause, surely it is these mostly minority\nparents who believe that the best way to ensure equal protection of the laws is\nto give them the opportunity—along with other parents who live in poverty\nand whose children are in failing schools—to send their children to better\nschools. The parents are also within the zone of interest of the legislation\nenacting the Scholarship Program; indeed, these parents and their children\nwere its primary intended beneficiaries. They therefore assert not only a mat-\nter of public interest but matters more relevant to them than to anyone else.\n\n\n                                        8\n\f     Case: 13-31262       Document: 00512591800          Page: 9     Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-31262\n                                              2.\n       “Once a movant has successfully established a sufficient interest in the\nsubject of the action, the movant must demonstrate that disposition of that\naction may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the movant’s ability to\nprotect that interest.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-41; Sierra Club, 18 F.3d\nat 1207. The impairment requirement does not demand that the movant be\nbound by a possible future judgment, and the current requirement is a great\nliberalization of the prior rule. 6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-41; Edwards,\n78 F.3d at 1004–05. The impairment must be “practical,” however, and not\nmerely “theoretical.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-42.\n       The parents have established that their interests might be impaired by\nthis action.     If the desegregation order is modified to require prior court\napproval of the Program’s implementation, then some parents are at risk of\nlosing vouchers or their full range of school choices. We found similarly in\nEdwards, 78 F.3d at 1005, that the officers would be bound by the consent\ndecree and therefore would be “limited in their future promotion\nopportunities.”\n       To be sure, there is as of yet no order requiring a change in the voucher\nprogram. But the parents do not need to establish that their interests will be\nimpaired. Rather, they must demonstrate only that the disposition of the\naction “may” impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.\n6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-41. 2 It would indeed be a questionable rule that\nwould require prospective intervenors to wait on the sidelines until after a\ncourt has already decided enough issues contrary to their interests. The very\n\n\n       2See also Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 399 (6th Cir. 1999) (“To satisfy this ele-\nment of the intervention test, a would-be intervenor must show only that impairment of its\nsubstantial legal interest is possible if intervention is denied. This burden is minimal.”\n(emphasis added)).\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 13-31262       Document: 00512591800    Page: 10   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 13-31262\npurpose of intervention is to allow interested parties to air their views so that\na court may consider them before making potentially adverse decisions.\n      In Grutter, the court found the impairment element satisfied with\nrespect to groups of minority students because “[t]here is little room for doubt\nthat access to the University for African–American and Latino/a students will\nbe impaired to some extent and that a substantial decline in the enrollment of\nthese students may well result if the University is precluded from considering\nrace as a factor in admissions.” Grutter, 188 F.3d at 400 (emphasis added).\nHere, similarly, the parents’ access to vouchers will be impaired because a\ndecline in prospects for obtaining vouchers may well result if the district court\nholds that the Scholarship Program is subject to the desegregation order.\n\n\n                                         3.\n      “The final requirement for intervention as a matter of right is that the\napplicant’s interest must be inadequately represented by the existing parties\nto the suit. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating inadequate repre-\nsentation, but this burden is ‘minimal.’” Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1207. “The\nburden on the movant is not a substantial one. The movant need not show that\nthe representation by existing parties will be, for certain, inadequate. . . . [T]he\napplicant’s burden on this matter should be viewed as ‘minimal.’” 6 MOORE’S\n§ 24.03[4][a], at 24-47 (citing Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S.\n528, 538 n.10 (1972)).\n      This requirement, however, must have some teeth, so there are two\npresumptions of adequate representation. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1005. The first\narises where one party is a representative of the absentee by law. Id. Here\nthere is no suggestion that the state is the parents’ legal representative. The\nsecond presumption “arises when the would-be intervenor has the same ulti-\nmate objective as a party to the lawsuit,” in which event “the applicant for\n                                        10\n\f   Case: 13-31262    Document: 00512591800      Page: 11   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 13-31262\nintervention must show adversity of interest, collusion, or nonfeasance on the\npart of the existing party to overcome the presumption.” Id.\n      The second presumption does not apply here. Although both the state\nand the parents vigorously oppose dismantling the voucher program, their\ninterests may not align precisely.      In Sierra Club the Forest Service was\ndefending against the claims of various environmental groups and ultimately\nlost on the merits. A preliminary injunction was therefore issued, whereupon\nthe Service indicated it would comply with the injunction and stop selling cer-\ntain kinds of timber. It was at that point that the timber companies attempted\nto intervene. Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1204. The plaintiffs similarly contended\nthat the Service adequately represented the movants’ interest because the\ninterests were essentially identical.    Id. at 1207.   We rejected that claim\nbecause in complying with the injunction, the Service would be acting contrary\nto the interests of the companies. Id. at 1207–08.\n      To be sure, that may not be enough to satisfy the inadequate-\nrepresentation prong generally; if it could, then no analysis of adequacy of\nrepresentation during trial would be necessary. In Sierra Club the intervenors\nattempted to intervene after the injunction had issued; here, on the other hand,\nthere is yet no injunction.   Nonetheless, in Sierra Club we bolstered our\nreasoning by noting that “[t]he government must represent the broad public\ninterest, not just the economic concerns of the timber industry,” and therefore\nthe timber groups satisfied the minimal burden of showing inadequacy.\n      Although a private group does not always satisfy this prong just because\na governmental entity is on the same side of an issue, in this case the parents\nhave easily met their minimal burden. The state has many interests in this\ncase—maintaining not only the Scholarship Program but also its relationship\nwith the federal government and with the courts that have continuing deseg-\nregation jurisdiction. The parents do not have the latter two interests; their\n                                        11\n\f    Case: 13-31262       Document: 00512591800         Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-31262\nonly concern is keeping their vouchers. We cannot say for sure that the state’s\nmore extensive interests will in fact result in inadequate representation, but\nsurely they might, which is all that the rule requires.\n       Further, the parents are staking out a position significantly different\nfrom that of the state, which apparently has conceded the continuing jurisdic-\ntion of the district court. For example, the state has admitted that “the Schol-\narship program does constitute State aid subject to the orders and decrees in\nthis case,” but the parents challenge that notion, citing Zelman v. Simmons-\nHarris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), for the proposition that school vouchers do not\nconstitute aid to private schools.\n       In Edwards the defendant city thought it needed to “change the existing\npromotional policies and procedures” of the police department, whereas the\ngroup attempting to intervene urged that those policies needed no adjustment.\nEdwards, 78 F.3d at 1005. That was enough to rebut the presumption of ade-\nquate representation stemming from purportedly identical ultimate objectives.\nHere the case for intervention is even stronger. First, it is not evident that the\nultimate-objective presumption of adequate representation even applies\nbecause the state has more extensive interests to balance than do the parents.\nThe lack of unity in all objectives, combined with real and legitimate additional\nor contrary arguments, is sufficient to demonstrate that the representation\nmay be inadequate, so this requirement of Rule 24(a) is met. 3\n       Because the parents have met the requirements for intervention as of\nright, the denial of their motion to intervene is REVERSED.\n\n\n       3 We note that parents were granted intervention in Simmons-Harris, and although\nstate-court cases are not dispositive or binding on us, our ultimate conclusion is supported\nby other school-voucher cases in which parents were allowed to intervene.

Id. at 349.\n      The United States initially sought the injunction on the ground that the\nvoucher program constituted public assistance to private schools in violation\nof the desegregation order: “The State’s actions in using public funds to trans-\nfer students in districts operating under desegregation orders to schools which\nthey are not zoned to attend,” argued the government, “cause irreparable\ninjury to the court-ordered desegregation process, the parties to the desegre-\ngation action, and ultimately to the students and the communities governed by\nthe desegregation decree.” The government further urged that the program\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 13-31262     Document: 00512591800      Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\n“deprives the students of their right to a desegregated educational experience.”\n      The parents moved to intervene as a matter of right for the limited pur-\npose of opposing the motion for permanent injunction. The United States, how-\never, claims that on September 23, 2013, it had informed the court that,\n      in light of the information already provided by the State and the\n      information the court had ordered the State to produce, the only\n      relief the United States now sought was the creation of a process\n      under which the State would provide the information needed to\n      assess and monitor the voucher program’s implementation consis-\n      tent with the orders in this case on a regular and timely basis.\n\nTherefore, according to the United States, it no longer sought the relief\nrequested in its August motion, and the intervention motion did not explain\n“how [the parents’] interests could be affected by the relief now being sought.”\n      The district court agreed with the United States and denied interven-\ntion. “Because the Motion that Proposed Intervenors sought to oppose no\nlonger requests the remedy Proposed Intervenors objected to,” the court held,\n“they lack the necessary interest to intervene. The only remaining issues in\nthe case, at this time, [a]ffect the sharing of information between the United\nStates and the State of Louisiana. These issues simply do not [a]ffect the inter-\nests of Proposed Intervenors.” The district court did allow for the possibility of\na renewed intervention motion should the United States seek its original relief.\n\n\n                                            II.\n      A court “must permit anyone to intervene who . . . claims an interest\nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is\nso situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or\nimpede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties ade-\nquately represent that interest.” FED.

Before doing so, however, we address a material factual dispute.\n\n\n                                        A.\n      The United States contends that the parents do not have an interest in\nthis litigation—and that if they do, it is not likely to be impaired—because they\nhave not explained how the new relief the government seeks involves or\nimpairs any interest of the parents. The government also maintains that the\nparents’ arguments as to interest and impairment are therefore waived\nbecause they were not presented to the district court. In other words, the\n\n                                        4\n\f    Case: 13-31262    Document: 00512591800     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 13-31262\ngovernment hinges its argument respecting these prongs almost entirely on its\nclaim that it is no longer seeking the relief it previously sought in its August\nmotion. We now explore that claim.\n      As previously discussed, in that motion the government sought a per-\nmanent injunction of the voucher program “unless and until the State receives\nauthorization from the appropriate federal court overseeing the applicable\ndesegregation case.” The district court issued an order on September 18 that\nprompted the United States to supplement its initial August motion.         The\nUnited States claims that as a result of that order, the three objectives of its\nAugust motion “are now in the process of being fulfilled” because the state has\nagreed to provide, to the government, data on the voucher program.\n      As the government states in its supplemental motion, however, the\nSeptember 18 order required the parties to brief and argue two legal issues:\nwhether the desegregation order applies to the Scholarship Program, and if so,\nwhether there is any need to amend existing orders. Significantly, in its sup-\nplemental motion the United States rephrased the district court’s first question\nas follows: “(1) [D]oes the desegregation order issued in Brumfield apply to the\nVoucher Program so as to require the State to obtain authorization from the\nCourt prior to implementation?” The government then stated, “To the extent\nthis Court determines it appropriate to resolve those two questions in the\naffirmative, and a schedule is put in place to facilitate compliance and the\ntimely sharing of school voucher program data and analysis by Louisiana as\nrequested by the United States, it is the position of the United States that the\nrelief sought by the August Motion will have been satisfied.”\n      It is not credible for the United States to claim that the relief it is now\nseeking differs from the relief the parents opposed in the August motion, in\nwhich it sought to enjoin the program unless and until the State receives\nauthorization from the appropriate federal court overseeing the applicable\n                                       5\n\f     Case: 13-31262      Document: 00512591800         Page: 6    Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-31262\ndesegregation case. In the supplemental motion, the government explains that\nto the extent that the Court affirmatively answers the first question, it believes\nthe goal of its prior motion has been satisfied. But an affirmative answer to\nthe first question as rephrased by the government would be “the desegregation\norder applies” and so “the state requires authorization from the court prior to\nimplementation.” There is no real difference between that relief and the relief\npreviously sought. Both would demand an injunction unless and until the state\nobtained court authorization. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span>\n\n\n                                            <span class=\"reporter\">Barb.</span>\n                                            <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       For intervention, a movant’s interest must be “direct, substantial, and\nlegally protectable.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.01[2][a], at 24-25; Edwards, 78 F.3d at\n1004; Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1207.

There, the police department\nhad entered into a consent decree with black and Hispanic officers; the district\ncourt had denied intervention by a group of white, female, and Asian-American\nofficers. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 989. The main complaint of that group was “that\nthe Consent Decree adversely affects the interests of its members in having\nequal access to a promotion system and promotion opportunities within the\n[department] for the ranks of Sergeant and Lieutenant without reference to\nrace, color, or national origin.” Id. at 1004. We held that that complaint stated\na sufficient interest for intervention.\n      Here, a potential decree—an amendment to the original decree in this\naction from 1975—similarly threatens a “prospective interference with” educa-\ntional opportunities. Further, any decree might “adversely affect[] the inter-\nests of [the parents] in having equal access to . . . opportunities . . . without\nreference to race, color, or national origin.” Finally, “existing” scholarships are\n“threatened by” a potential bar on certain kinds of vouchers. The United States\npoints to United States v. Perry County Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351574\"><a href=\"/opinion/351574/united-states-v-perry-county-board-of-education-joann-parsons/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th\nCir. 1978), for the proposition that this court has found that parents do not\nhave a sufficient interest to intervene in desegregation proceedings.         The\nparents challenge the very premise that the Scholarship Program is subject to\nany such proceedings. Even so, an old desegregation case involving a policy\ndispute over the location of a newly built school, see Perry, 567 F.2d at 279–80,\nis far less apposite than are Sierra Club, Edwards, and Black Fire Fighters.\n      To be sure, the United States is claiming that, at the moment, it has no\nintention of halting the voucher program or depriving anyone of an existing\nscholarship. Yet, if a modification of the decree requiring court approval means\nanything, it signifies that the government will have the ability to attempt to\n                                          7\n\f    Case: 13-31262     Document: 00512591800     Page: 8   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31262\nadjust some element of the Scholarship Program—either by changing which\nstudents receive the aid or changing the schools in which they are placed—if\nnot to urge that the program be killed entirely. The possibility is therefore real\nthat if the parents are not able adequately to protect their interests, some\nstudents who otherwise would get vouchers might not get them or might not\nget to select a particular school they otherwise would choose. The parents need\nnot wait to see whether that ultimately happens; they have already described\nan interest justifying intervention.\n      The public interest easily supports intervention: “The interest require-\nment may be judged by a more lenient standard if the case involves a public\ninterest question or is brought by a public interest group. The zone of interests\nprotected by a constitutional provision or statute of general application is argu-\nably broader than are the protectable interests recognized in other contexts.”\n6 MOORE’S § 24.03[2][c], at 24-34 (citing NOPSI, 732 F.2d at 464–65). Our\nen banc court has explained that a zone-of-interest analysis in standing doc-\ntrine can bear on the interest question for purposes of intervention. NOPSI,\n732 F.2d at 464–65.\n      The purported aim of the United States is to enforce the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. If any group can be described as within\nthe zone of interest protected by that clause, surely it is these mostly minority\nparents who believe that the best way to ensure equal protection of the laws is\nto give them the opportunity—along with other parents who live in poverty\nand whose children are in failing schools—to send their children to better\nschools. The parents are also within the zone of interest of the legislation\nenacting the Scholarship Program; indeed, these parents and their children\nwere its primary intended beneficiaries. They therefore assert not only a mat-\nter of public interest but matters more relevant to them than to anyone else.\n\n\n                                        8\n\f     Case: 13-31262       Document: 00512591800          Page: 9     Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-31262\n                                              2.\n       “Once a movant has successfully established a sufficient interest in the\nsubject of the action, the movant must demonstrate that disposition of that\naction may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the movant’s ability to\nprotect that interest.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-41; Sierra Club, 18 F.3d\nat 1207. The impairment requirement does not demand that the movant be\nbound by a possible future judgment, and the current requirement is a great\nliberalization of the prior rule. 6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-41; Edwards,\n78 F.3d at 1004–05. The impairment must be “practical,” however, and not\nmerely “theoretical.” 6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-42.\n       The parents have established that their interests might be impaired by\nthis action.     If the desegregation order is modified to require prior court\napproval of the Program’s implementation, then some parents are at risk of\nlosing vouchers or their full range of school choices. We found similarly in\nEdwards, 78 F.3d at 1005, that the officers would be bound by the consent\ndecree and therefore would be “limited in their future promotion\nopportunities.”\n       To be sure, there is as of yet no order requiring a change in the voucher\nprogram. But the parents do not need to establish that their interests will be\nimpaired. Rather, they must demonstrate only that the disposition of the\naction “may” impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.\n6 MOORE’S § 24.03[3][a], at 24-41. 2 It would indeed be a questionable rule that\nwould require prospective intervenors to wait on the sidelines until after a\ncourt has already decided enough issues contrary to their interests.

The applicant has the burden of demonstrating inadequate repre-\nsentation, but this burden is ‘minimal.’” Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1207. “The\nburden on the movant is not a substantial one. The movant need not show that\nthe representation by existing parties will be, for certain, inadequate. . . . [T]he\napplicant’s burden on this matter should be viewed as ‘minimal.’” 6 MOORE’S\n§ 24.03[4][a], at 24-47 (citing Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108434\"><a href=\"/opinion/108434/trbovich-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 n.10 (1972)).\n      This requirement, however, must have some teeth, so there are two\npresumptions of adequate representation. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1005. The first\narises where one party is a representative of the absentee by law. Id. Here\nthere is no suggestion that the state is the parents’ legal representative. The\nsecond presumption “arises when the would-be intervenor has the same ulti-\nmate objective as a party to the lawsuit,” in which event “the applicant for\n                                        10\n\f   Case: 13-31262    Document: 00512591800      Page: 11   Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 13-31262\nintervention must show adversity of interest, collusion, or nonfeasance on the\npart of the existing party to overcome the presumption.” Id.\n      The second presumption does not apply here. Although both the state\nand the parents vigorously oppose dismantling the voucher program, their\ninterests may not align precisely.      In Sierra Club the Forest Service was\ndefending against the claims of various environmental groups and ultimately\nlost on the merits. A preliminary injunction was therefore issued, whereupon\nthe Service indicated it would comply with the injunction and stop selling cer-\ntain kinds of timber. It was at that point that the timber companies attempted\nto intervene. Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1204. The plaintiffs similarly contended\nthat the Service adequately represented the movants’ interest because the\ninterests were essentially identical.    Id. at 1207.   We rejected that claim\nbecause in complying with the injunction, the Service would be acting contrary\nto the interests of the companies. Id. at 1207–08.\n      To be sure, that may not be enough to satisfy the inadequate-\nrepresentation prong generally; if it could, then no analysis of adequacy of\nrepresentation during trial would be necessary. In Sierra Club the intervenors\nattempted to intervene after the injunction had issued; here, on the other hand,\nthere is yet no injunction.   Nonetheless, in Sierra Club we bolstered our\nreasoning by noting that “[t]he government must represent the broad public\ninterest, not just the economic concerns of the timber industry,” and therefore\nthe timber groups satisfied the minimal burden of showing inadequacy.\n      Although a private group does not always satisfy this prong just because\na governmental entity is on the same side of an issue, in this case the parents\nhave easily met their minimal burden. The state has many interests in this\ncase—maintaining not only the Scholarship Program but also its relationship\nwith the federal government and with the courts that have continuing deseg-\nregation jurisdiction. The parents do not have the latter two interests; their\n                                        11\n\f    Case: 13-31262       Document: 00512591800         Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/10/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-31262\nonly concern is keeping their vouchers. We cannot say for sure that the state’s\nmore extensive interests will in fact result in inadequate representation, but\nsurely they might, which is all that the rule requires.\n       Further, the parents are staking out a position significantly different\nfrom that of the state, which apparently has conceded the continuing jurisdic-\ntion of the district court. For example, the state has admitted that “the Schol-\narship program does constitute State aid subject to the orders and decrees in\nthis case,” but the parents challenge that notion, citing Zelman v. Simmons-\nHarris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121168\"><a href=\"/opinion/121168/zelman-v-simmons-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), for the proposition that school vouchers do not\nconstitute aid to private schools.\n       In Edwards the defendant city thought it needed to “change the existing\npromotional policies and procedures” of the police department, whereas the\ngroup attempting to intervene urged that those policies needed no adjustment.\nEdwards, 78 F.3d at 1005. That was enough to rebut the presumption of ade-\nquate representation stemming from purportedly identical ultimate objectives.\nHere the case for intervention is even stronger. First, it is not evident that the\nultimate-objective presumption of adequate representation even applies\nbecause the state has more extensive interests to balance than do the parents.\nThe lack of unity in all objectives, combined with real and legitimate additional\nor contrary arguments, is sufficient to demonstrate that the representation\nmay be inadequate, so this requirement of Rule 24(a) is met. 3\n       Because the parents have met the requirements for intervention as of\nright, the denial of their motion to intervene is REVERSED.\n\n\n       3 We note that parents were granted intervention in Simmons-Harris, and although\nstate-court cases are not dispositive or binding on us, our ultimate conclusion is supported\nby other school-voucher cases in which parents were allowed to intervene.
