In that Opinion, I rejected both your proposed popular name and ballot title due to several unresolved ambiguities in the <em>text</em> of your measure.

The law provides that the Attorney General may substitute and certify a more suitable and correct popular name and ballot title, if he can do so, or if the proposed popular name and ballot title are sufficiently misleading, may reject the entire petition.</p>\n<p>A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference> neither requires nor authorizes this office to make legal determinations concerning the merits of the act or amendment, or concerning the likelihood that it will accomplish its stated objective. Consequently, this review has been limited to a determination, pursuant to the guidelines that have been set forth by the Arkansas Supreme Court, discussed below, of whether the proposed popular name and ballot title accurately and impartially summarize the provisions of your proposed amendment.</p>\n<p>The purpose of my review and certification is to ensure that the popular name and ballot title honestly, intelligibly, and fairly set forth the purpose of the proposed amendment. <u>See</u> <em>Arkansas Women's Political Caucus</em><em>v. Riviere,</em> <cross_reference>282 Ark. 463</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>466</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>677 S.W.2d 846</cross_reference> (1984).</p>\n<p>The popular name is primarily a useful legislative device. <em>Pafford v.</em><em>Hall,</em> <cross_reference>217 Ark. 734</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>233 S.W.2d 72</cross_reference> (1950). It need not contain detailed information or include exceptions that might be required of a ballot title, but it must not be misleading or give partisan coloring to the merit of the proposal. <em>Chaney v. Bryant,</em> <cross_reference>259 Ark. 294</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>532 S.W.2d 741</cross_reference>\n(1976); <em>Moore v. Hall,</em> <cross_reference>229 Ark. 411</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316 S.W.2d 207</cross_reference> (1958). The popular name is to be considered together with the ballot title in determining the ballot title's sufficiency. <u>Id.</u></p>\n<p>The ballot title must include an impartial summary of the proposed amendment that will give the voter a fair understanding of the issues presented. <em>Hoban v. Hall,</em> <cross_reference>229 Ark. 416</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316 S.W.2d 185</cross_reference> (1958); <em>Becker</em><em>v.

According to the court, if information omitted from the ballot title is an \"essential fact which would give the voter serious ground for reflection, it must be disclosed.\" <em>Bailey v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>318 Ark. 277</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>285</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 938</cross_reference> (1994), citing <em>Finn v.

Hall, supra</em>; and<em>Walton v. McDonald,</em> <cross_reference>192 Ark. 1155</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97 S.W.2d 81</cross_reference> (1936). At the same time, however, a ballot title must be brief and concise (<u>see</u> A.C.A. &#167;<cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(b)); otherwise voters could run afoul of A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-5-522</cross_reference>'s five minute limit in voting booths when other voters are waiting in line.<em>Bailey v. McCuen, supra.</em> The ballot title is not required to be perfect, nor is it reasonable to expect the title to cover or anticipate every possible legal argument the proposed measure might evoke. <em>Plugge v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>310 Ark. 654</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>841 S.W.2d 139</cross_reference> (1992). The title, however, must be free from any misleading tendency, whether by amplification, omission, or fallacy; it must not be tinged with partisan coloring. <u>Id.</u> A ballot title must convey an intelligible idea of the scope and significance of a proposed change in the law. <em>Christian Civic Action Committee v. McCuen,</em><cross_reference>318 Ark. 241</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 605</cross_reference> (1994). It has been stated that the ballot title must be: 1) intelligible, 2) honest, and 3) impartial. <em>Becker v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>303 Ark. 482</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798 S.W.2d 71</cross_reference> (1990), citing <em>Leigh v. Hall,</em><cross_reference>232 Ark. 558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>339 S.W.2d 104</cross_reference> (1960).</p>\n<p>Having analyzed your proposed amendment, as well as your proposed popular name and ballot title under the above precepts, it is my conclusion that I must again reject both your proposed popular name and ballot title due to a remaining unresolved ambiguity in the <em>text</em> of your measure. There are a number of additions or changes to your popular name and ballot title which in my view are necessary in order to more fully and correctly summarize your proposal. I cannot, however, at this time, fairly or completely summarize the effect of your proposed measure to the electorate without the resolution of this ambiguity. I am therefore unable to substitute and certify a more suitable and correct ballot title under A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference> (b).</p>\n<p>The ambiguity to which I refer is found in Section 5 of your proposed amendment, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  Henceforth, all retirement accounts or plans for public servants shall be maintained on an actuarily [sic] sound basis in accounts maintained for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Retirement funds shall not be commingled with other government funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, public servants holding vested rights in unfunded or partially funded retirement plans, payable from the public treasury or any public retirement account of the State of Arkansas or any of its subdivisions, shall be entitled to retain the rights vested under such plans. The General Assembly shall by general law require that all vested but less than fully funded retirement accounts for public servants be fully funded as soon as reasonably practicable, with respect to amounts which would have been required to fully fund such retirement accounts as of June 30, 2001. All retirement plans for state or local public servants hired after July 1, 2001, shall be maintained in approved privately managed retirement account(s) as may be chosen by the public servant, from any entity lawfully authorized to offer retirement plans within the State of Arkansas.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am still uncertain as to what is to transpire under this provision. It is plain, from a reading of the last sentence, that public servants hired after July 1, 2001 will participate, if at all, in privately held retirement plans. The language of Section 5 above which precedes this last sentence must therefore refer to the retirement \"accounts\" of public servants employed prior to the effective date. The Section provides that: \"[h]enceforth, all retirement accounts or plans for public servants shall be maintained on an actuarily [sic] sound basis in accounts maintained for the purpose of providing retirement benefits\" and \"[r]etirement funds shall not be commingled with other government funds.\" Does the language above require the liquidation of assets or investments held by all state and local public servant retirement systems, and the placing of the proceeds in individual member accounts or does this language merely require any contributions made after the effective date to be separately held? I am unable to determine the permissible scope of investment of the funds in either case.</p>\n<p>Constitutional issues may also arise under the \"obligations of contracts clause\" of the United States Constitution (see art. 1, &#167; 10 (1)) with regard to changing the terms and conditions of the retirement plans of existing state employees whether or not they are \"vested.\" <u>See e.g.,</u> Op. Att'y. Gen. <cross_reference>95-071</cross_reference>. Similar issues may arise if the liquidation of retirement system assets is contemplated. Additional concerns may arise under this same constitutional provision with regard to the salary limitations and fringe benefit provisions of your amendment. The latter issues would arise most prominently in the case of certain public servants holding multi-year employment contracts or renewal rights.</p>\n<p>I cannot adequately summarize the provisions of your proposed amendment without clarification of these issues.</p>\n<p>My office, in the certification of ballot titles and popular names, does not concern itself with the merits, philosophy, or ideology of proposed measures. I have no constitutional role in the shaping or drafting of such measures. My statutory mandate is embodied only in A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>\nand my duty is to the electorate. I am not your counsel in this matter and cannot advise you as to the substance of your proposal.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, the Arkansas Supreme Court, through its decisions, has placed a practical duty on the Attorney General, in exercising his statutory duty, to include language in a ballot title about the effects of a proposed measure on current law. <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.,</u> <em>Finn</em><em>v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>303 Ark. 418</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>793 S.W.2d 34</cross_reference> (1990). Where the effects of a proposed measure on current law are unclear or ambiguous, it is impossible for me to perform my statutory duty to the satisfaction of the Arkansas Supreme Court without clarification of the ambiguities.</p>\n<p>My statutory duty, under these circumstances, is to reject your proposed ballot title, stating my reasons therefor. <u>See</u> A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(c). I anticipate, as noted above, that some changes or additions to your submitted ballot title may be necessary. I will be pleased to perform my statutory duties in this regard in a timely manner should you resubmit.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>MARK PRYOR Attorney General</p>\n<p>Enclosure</p>",

McCuen, supra.</em> The ballot title is not required to be perfect, nor is it reasonable to expect the title to cover or anticipate every possible legal argument the proposed measure might evoke. <em>Plugge v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2447372\"><a href=\"/opinion/2447372/plugge-v-mccuen/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2447372\"><a href=\"/opinion/2447372/plugge-v-mccuen/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1992). The title, however, must be free from any misleading tendency, whether by amplification, omission, or fallacy; it must not be tinged with partisan coloring. <u>Id.</u> A ballot title must convey an intelligible idea of the scope and significance of a proposed change in the law. <em>Christian Civic Action Committee v.

There are a number of additions or changes to your popular name and ballot title which in my view are necessary in order to more fully and correctly summarize your proposal. I cannot, however, at this time, fairly or completely summarize the effect of your proposed measure to the electorate without the resolution of this ambiguity. I am therefore unable to substitute and certify a more suitable and correct ballot title under A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference> (b).</p>\n<p>The ambiguity to which I refer is found in Section 5 of your proposed amendment, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  Henceforth, all retirement accounts or plans for public servants shall be maintained on an actuarily [sic] sound basis in accounts maintained for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Retirement funds shall not be commingled with other government funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, public servants holding vested rights in unfunded or partially funded retirement plans, payable from the public treasury or any public retirement account of the State of Arkansas or any of its subdivisions, shall be entitled to retain the rights vested under such plans. The General Assembly shall by general law require that all vested but less than fully funded retirement accounts for public servants be fully funded as soon as reasonably practicable, with respect to amounts which would have been required to fully fund such retirement accounts as of June 30, 2001. All retirement plans for state or local public servants hired after July 1, 2001, shall be maintained in approved privately managed retirement account(s) as may be chosen by the public servant, from any entity lawfully authorized to offer retirement plans within the State of Arkansas.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am still uncertain as to what is to transpire under this provision. It is plain, from a reading of the last sentence, that public servants hired after July 1, 2001 will participate, if at all, in privately held retirement plans. The language of Section 5 above which precedes this last sentence must therefore refer to the retirement \"accounts\" of public servants employed prior to the effective date. The Section provides that: \"[h]enceforth, all retirement accounts or plans for public servants shall be maintained on an actuarily [sic] sound basis in accounts maintained for the purpose of providing retirement benefits\" and \"[r]etirement funds shall not be commingled with other government funds.\" Does the language above require the liquidation of assets or investments held by all state and local public servant retirement systems, and the placing of the proceeds in individual member accounts or does this language merely require any contributions made after the effective date to be separately held? I am unable to determine the permissible scope of investment of the funds in either case.</p>\n<p>Constitutional issues may also arise under the \"obligations of contracts clause\" of the United States Constitution (see art. 1, &#167; 10 (1)) with regard to changing the terms and conditions of the retirement plans of existing state employees whether or not they are \"vested.\" <u>See e.g.,</u> Op. Att'y. Gen. <cross_reference>95-071</cross_reference>. Similar issues may arise if the liquidation of retirement system assets is contemplated. Additional concerns may arise under this same constitutional provision with regard to the salary limitations and fringe benefit provisions of your amendment. The latter issues would arise most prominently in the case of certain public servants holding multi-year employment contracts or renewal rights.</p>\n<p>I cannot adequately summarize the provisions of your proposed amendment without clarification of these issues.</p>\n<p>My office, in the certification of ballot titles and popular names, does not concern itself with the merits, philosophy, or ideology of proposed measures. I have no constitutional role in the shaping or drafting of such measures. My statutory mandate is embodied only in A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>\nand my duty is to the electorate. I am not your counsel in this matter and cannot advise you as to the substance of your proposal.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, the Arkansas Supreme Court, through its decisions, has placed a practical duty on the Attorney General, in exercising his statutory duty, to include language in a ballot title about the effects of a proposed measure on current law. <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.,</u> <em>Finn</em><em>v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455506\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455506/finn-v-mccuen/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span></cross_reference> (1990). Where the effects of a proposed measure on current law are unclear or ambiguous, it is impossible for me to perform my statutory duty to the satisfaction of the Arkansas Supreme Court without clarification of the ambiguities.</p>\n<p>My statutory duty, under these circumstances, is to reject your proposed ballot title, stating my reasons therefor. <u>See</u> A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(c). I anticipate, as noted above, that some changes or additions to your submitted ballot title may be necessary. I will be pleased to perform my statutory duties in this regard in a timely manner should you resubmit.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>MARK PRYOR Attorney General</p>\n<p>Enclosure</p>",
