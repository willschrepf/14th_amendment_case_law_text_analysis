(City of Pasadena v. Cohen\n(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1461, 1462-1463 (Pasadena).)\n        The City of Azusa, its municipal utility (Azusa Light and Water, hereafter Utility)\nand the successor agency to its redevelopment agency (hereafter collectively City except\nas noted), timely appeal from a judgment denying their amended mandamus petition\n(Code Civ. Proc, § 1085). The petition sought to compel the director of the Department\nof Finance (Department) to recognize as enforceable certain obligations between the City\nand the Utility. These consisted of loans from the Utility to the City’s former\nredevelopment agency (RDA). The City asserts the invalidation of these loans in effect\nharms the Utility’s ratepayers and therefore is unlawful for various reasons. The trial\ncourt rejected the City’s view, and the City timely appeals from the ensuing judgment.\n        We agree with the trial court that once Utility money was loaned to the RDA, it\nceased to be “ratepayer money.” Because the City’s legal claims hinge on a contrary\nview--whether or not explicitly acknowledged in its briefing--each of the City’s claims\nfail.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n        1. Redevelopment Agencies Generally\n        The Community Redevelopment Law was adopted to address post-World War II\nurban blight, by allowing the formation of redevelopment agencies to make municipal\nimprovements via “tax increment” funding, which reallocated tax revenues; however,\nover time concerns grew that abuses were occurring. (See California Redevelopment\nAssn. v. Matosantos (2011) 53 Cal.4th 231, 245-248 (Matosantos); City of Emeryville v.\nCohen (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 293, 297-298 (Emeryville).)\n        Amid a fiscal crisis in 2011, the Legislature adopted the dissolution law via\nstatutes “that barred any new redevelopment agency obligations, and established\nprocedures for the windup and dissolution of the obligations of the nearly 400\n\n                                              2\n\fredevelopment agencies then existing.” (Pasadena, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1462-\n1463; see Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 241.) Our Supreme Court invalidated a\nportion of the law, but upheld provisions requiring windup and dissolution of\nredevelopment agencies, as provided by the Health and Safety Code.1 (Matosantos,\nsupra, 53 Cal.4th at pp. 274-276.)\n        The dissolution law provides that successor agencies shall “[e]xpeditiously wind\ndown” the redevelopment agency under “direction of the oversight board.” (§ 34177,\nsubd. (h).) Oversight boards consist of appointed members (§ 34179, subd. (a)), and have\na fiduciary duty towards “holders of enforceable obligations and the taxing entities that\nbenefit from distributions of property tax” (§ 34179, subd. (i)), including the duty to\nreview actions by successor agencies, such as “[e]stablishment of the Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule.” (§ 34180, subd. (g).) The recognized obligation\npayment schedule (ROPS) sets forth remaining “enforceable obligations” as defined\n(§ 34171, subd. (h)) and allows for review to ensure accuracy. (See Emeryville, supra,\n233 Cal.App.4th at pp. 298-299.)\n        2. The Loans Herein\n        There are no relevant factual disputes about the loans at issue, and the trial court\nprepared a thorough statement of facts from which we borrow liberally.\n        The City, the Utility, and the RDA, were governed by the same five elected city\ncouncil members, and at oral argument on the petition the trial court referenced the “three\ndifferent hats” worn. Our Supreme Court has noted that “the Legislature could well\nrecognize that because of the conjoined nature of the governing boards of redevelopment\nagencies and their community sponsors, [obligations between them] often were not the\nproduct of arm’s-length transactions.” (Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 258, fn. 12.)\n\n\n\n\n1   All undesignated statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code.\n\n                                               3\n\fThe City is the successor agency to the RDA, bestowing yet another “hat” on city council\nmembers. We refer to the City when referencing actions taken by city council members\nin their capacity as the successor agency.2\n       The Utility provides water and electricity within the City and to some users\noutside the City. The Utility and City act jointly. The Utility “sets rates and collects\nmoney from its ratepayers in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of providing utility\nservices. It is financially self-sufficient, receiving no money from the City general fund\nor local taxes. The money generated . . . is held in two separate enterprise funds: the\nLight Fund and the Water Fund.” The Utility made six loans to the RDA, “totaling\nnearly $8 million over the last two decades: four loans from the Light Fund and two\nloans from the Water Fund. The first loan was made in 1988, and the last in 2011. By\n2012, none of the loans had been repaid; the outstanding principal and interest was over\n$10 million.” (Fn. omitted.) “It appears no payments were made on three of the loans,”\napproximately $6,600 was paid on one loan, and “[s]ignificant payments were made on\nthe other two loans . . . although significant amounts remained due.”3\n\n\n\n\n2 The fact the city council members wear four hats does not of itself infer impropriety.\n“It is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed.” (Evid. Code, § 664; see\nEmeryville, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at pp. 302-303.)\n3 The trial court interpreted a local ordinance to permit the Utility to loan money to the\nCity, but implied this did not permit loans to the RDA, and noted this “emphasizes the\n‘conjoined nature’ of the City and the RDA.” The City argues it should be accorded\ndeference in interpreting its own ordinances. The Department asserts all the loans were\nunauthorized by the ordinance, and also asserts that the Water Fund loans were unlawful\nunder Proposition 218. Because this action does not seek to invalidate the loans as ultra\nvires or otherwise, and we resolve it on other grounds, we do not address this dispute.\nThe trial court also addressed a seventh loan, whereby the City loaned sales and use taxes\nto the RDA in 1988. However, the City has not made any arguments about this seventh\nloan, abandoning any claims about it. (See Meddock v. County of Yolo (2013) 220\nCal.App.4th 170, 175, fn. 2.)\n\n                                              4\n\f       The Department rejected these loans on the City’s ROPS, based on section 34171,\nsubdivision (d)(2), providing “ ‘enforceable obligation’ does not include any agreements,\ncontracts, or arrangements between the city . . . that created the redevelopment agency\nand the former redevelopment agency.” The Department found the Utility was the City\nfor purposes of the dissolution law because it is “controlled by” the City. (See\n§ 34167.10, subds. (a)(3); Stats. 2012, ch. 26, § 5.)\n       The Department issued a “finding of completion,” meaning the loans may be\nrepaid if the oversight board finds they were for legitimate redevelopment purposes. (See\n§ 34191.4, subd. (b)(1).) But if that happens, the interest rate would be recalculated, and\n20 percent of the loan repayment would be transferred to the “Low and Moderate Income\nHousing Asset Fund.” (See § 34191.4, subd. (b)(2).)\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       The City heads four multi-faceted claims why it was improper for the Department\nto refuse to treat the Utility loans as enforceable obligations of the City, acting as the\nRDA’s successor agency: (1) The effect of the Department’s actions is to divert special\nfunds for an unlawful purpose; (2) the Department is unlawfully compelling increased\ntaxes; (3) the Department is effecting an unlawful gift of public funds; and (4) the\nDepartment’s actions will result in unlawful takings.\n       As we shall explain (part I, post), the factual predicate--implicit or explicit--for\neach of these legal claims is that some assets held by the RDA retained the character of\nbeing ratepayer assets, because those assets came from the Utility’s Light Fund or Water\nFund. However, as the trial court found, this factual predicate is incorrect: As money\nwas loaned to the RDA, it became an RDA asset, and therefore was subject to legislative\ndisposition via the dissolution law. We shall then explain (part II, post), why each of the\nCity’s legal claims falters because of the failure of its factual predicate.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f                                              I\n                              RDA Assets as Ratepayer Assets\n       The City attacks the trial court’s central finding that the RDA assets from the loans\nare not ratepayer assets. The City asserts the trial court was wrong, because the loans on\nthe books were liabilities of the RDA, not assets, and the dissolution law could not cancel\nthose liabilities to the detriment of the ratepayers. We disagree.\n       When the Utility loaned money to the RDA, the RDA took possession of the\nmoney, and the Utility received a promise of repayment. But the money was an RDA\nasset, whether it defaulted on the loan or not. All loans are potentially subject to default.4\nOn the effective date of the dissolution law, the RDA was in possession of that money, or\nwhatever objects or interests it had acquired by spending some or all of that money. The\ndissolution law specifies how all of the assets held by the RDA were to be reallocated,\nand sets forth detailed definitions of which obligations would and would not be treated as\n“enforceable” obligations. The dissolution law does not provide for tracing RDA assets\nso as to determine their source.\n       The “freeze” portion of the dissolution law “is intended to preserve, to the\nmaximum extent possible, the revenues and assets of redevelopment agencies so that\nthose assets and revenues that are not needed to pay for enforceable obligations may be\nused by local governments to fund core governmental services . . . . All provisions of this\n\n\n\n\n4 We note that each of the five operative promissory notes in the record is captioned as\nan “unsecured” note, although anticipated payments would come from tax increment\nrevenue and other sources. The other note is not in the record, and although the RDA and\nCity resolutions pertaining to that loan spoke of a “secured” loan, it appears that merely\nreferred to the practice of anticipating RDA loans would be repaid via tax increment\nrevenue. Absent review of the note itself, we do not infer it was a “secured” note in the\nordinary sense that specific property or assets guaranteed the loan, nor does the City\nclaim the notes were so secured.\n\n                                              6\n\fpart shall be so construed as broadly as possible to support this intent and to restrict the\nexpenditure of funds to the fullest extent possible.” (§ 34167, subd. (a).)\n       The “dissolution” portion “requires successor agencies to continue to make\npayments and perform existing [enforceable] obligations. [Citation.] However,\nunencumbered balances of redevelopment agency funds must be remitted to the county\nauditor-controller for distribution to cities, the county, special districts, and school\ndistricts in proportion to what each agency would have received absent the\nredevelopment agencies. [Citations.] Proceeds from redevelopment agency asset sales\nlikewise must go to the county auditor-controller for similar distribution. [Citation.]\nFinally, tax increment revenues that would have gone to redevelopment agencies must be\ndeposited in a local trust fund each county is required to create and administer.\n[Citations.] All amounts necessary to satisfy administrative costs, pass-through\npayments, and enforceable obligations will be allocated for those purposes, while any\nexcess will be deemed property tax revenue and distributed in the same fashion as\nbalances and assets.” (Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 251.) One section in this part\nof the dissolution law provides that “All assets, properties, contracts, leases, books and\nrecords, buildings, and equipment of the former redevelopment agency are transferred . . .\nto the control of the successor agency, for administration pursuant to the provisions of\nthis part. . . . Any legal or contractual restrictions on the use of these funds or assets shall\nalso be transferred to the successor agency.” (§ 34175, subd. (b), italics added.) “All\nassets” under this statute plainly encompasses loaned money. And although the RDA had\na contractual obligation to repay the loans, none of the money lent was restricted, that is,\nthe City makes no claim that the RDA was prevented from using any of the money lent in\nany particular way.\n       Thus, it is incumbent on the City to identify any provision of the comprehensive\nand detailed dissolution law that makes enforceable the particular loans at issue in this\ncase, and it has not attempted to do so. Instead, the City insists that on the effective date\n\n                                               7\n\fof the dissolution law, the RDA possessed certain types of assets that were not subject to\ndisposition by that law, because those assets, due to the encumbrance, actually belonged\nto the Utility’s ratepayers. The City has provided no authority for this proposition,\nwhich undermines the purpose of the dissolution law, namely, to dispose of all assets\n(§ 34175, subd. (b)) held by the RDA.\n       What the dissolution law does provide, in part, is that “ ‘enforceable obligation’\ndoes not include any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city . . . that\ncreated the [RDA] and the former [RDA].” (§ 34171, subd. (d)(2).) As the trial court\nfound, the loans from the Utility to the City constitute “agreements, contracts, or\narrangements” between the City (acting as its controlled Utility) and the City’s RDA.\n       Thus, we uphold the trial court’s finding that no ratepayer money was diverted\nwhen the Department sought to implement the dissolution law. As stated, the Legislature\nwanted to divert all RDA assets, while specifying which RDA obligations remained\nenforceable. Under section 34171, subdivision (d)(2), the trial court properly denied the\nCity’s mandamus petition seeking to treat the debts from the Utility loans that remained\non the RDA’s books on the effect date of the dissolution law as enforceable obligations.\n                                             II\n                                  The City’s Legal Claims\n       We now examine the City’s legal claims seriatim. In doing so, “we are mindful\nthat ‘all intendments favor the exercise of the Legislature’s plenary authority: “If there is\nany doubt as to the Legislature’s power to act in any given case, the doubt should be\nresolved in favor of the Legislature’s action. Such restrictions and limitations [imposed\nby the Constitution] are to be construed strictly, and are not to be extended to include\nmatters not covered by the language used.” ’ ” (Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 253;\nsee Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Saylor (1971) 5 Cal.3d 685, 691.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       A. Diverting Special Funds\n       The City contends the effect of the Department’s actions is to divert special funds\nfor an unrelated and, hence, unlawful purpose. We disagree.\n       Generally speaking legislation cannot permanently divert special funds to\nunrelated purposes, although legislation allowing or requiring loans of such money is\npermitted. (See California Medical Assn v. Brown (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1449, 1456-\n1458; Service Employees Internat. Union, Local 1000 v. Brown (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th\n252, 268, fn. 8 [loans are “an integral component of the budgetary calculus”]; Edgemont\nCommunity Service Dist. v. City of Moreno Valley (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1163-\n1166; Veterans of Foreign Wars v. State of California (1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 688, 694.)\n       The City’s water and light funds collect money from ratepayers to produce and\ndistribute utility services. But, contrary to the City’s view, nothing in the dissolution law\ndiverted any money from those funds. The Legislature did not divert any money from the\nUtility funds. That money was diverted by the city council years earlier when it loaned\nmoney from the Utility to the RDA. Accordingly, we reject the City’s legal claims about\ndiversion of special funds.\n       B. Change in Statute Triggering a Higher Tax\n       The City next contends the Department is unlawfully compelling increased taxes.\nIt reasons that because the loans will not be paid off, Utility rates will have to be raised\nand therefore, as applied to these facts, the dissolution law increases taxes (as broadly\ndefined as discussed post); however, it is uncontested that the dissolution law did not pass\nby the two-thirds margin necessary to raise taxes.\n       The dissolution law did not increase taxes nor will it result in any tax increase,\nwhich under Propositions 218 and 26 is defined to include certain government charges\nwhether or not denominated as a tax, and require voter approval therefor. (See Schmeer\nv. County of Los Angeles (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1319-1329; Howard Jarvis\nTaxpayers Association v. City of Roseville (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 637, 640-646.)\n\n                                              9\n\f       Utility rates do not increase by operation of law; action is required by the Utility,\nwhich sets the service rates. (See American Microsystems, Inc. v. City of Santa Clara\n(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1042-1043 [“it is the public entity itself which fixes utility\nrates”].) The Legislature plays no role in rate setting by municipal utilities.\n       If the residents of the City believe the unpaid loans have depleted the Utility’s\nfunds to the extent that a tax increase is required to ensure appropriate services, they are\nfree to enact such an increase. But the dissolution law will not, of itself, result in an\nincrease.5\n       C Gift of Public Funds\n       The City contends the Department is compelling an unlawful gift of public funds.\nWe disagree with this view.\n       With exceptions not relevant, “The Legislature shall have no power . . . to make\nany gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any\nindividual, municipal or other corporation whatever.” (Cal. Const., Art. XVI, § 6.) In\npart, as the City argues, this provision prohibits taking funds from one group of taxpayers\nand transferring them to benefit another group of taxpayers unless the funds are used to\nfurther the purpose of the donor entity. (See California Redevelopment Assn. v.\nMatosantos (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1464, 1469-1473, 1483-1484; Golden Gate\nBridge and Highway Dist. v. Luehring (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 204, 206-211.)\n       Thus, the City’s contention echoes the “special funds” contention we have already\nrejected. The City emphasizes that the money came from the Utility’s water and light\nfunds, and argues the Legislature has in effect taken ratepayer money from some users--\n\n\n\n\n5We observe that the trial court found: “Some of these loans were made almost two\ndecades ago, yet no payments had been made by the time the RDA was dissolved.\nDespite having lost the use of this money for decades, the City has not yet had to raise\nutility rates.”\n\n                                              10\n\fincluding some outside of the City--and “given” it to “the beneficiaries” of the City’s\nredevelopment projects. The City further observes that, generally speaking, the\ncancellation of a debt may equate to a “gift” within the meaning of the constitutional\nproscription against gifts of public funds. (See Westly v. U.S. Bancorp. (2003) 114\nCal.App.4th 577, 585.) The City argues the Utility could not have given the money to the\nRDA, but was required to loan it, to avoid the gift proscription, therefore legislative\ninvalidation of those loans results in a de facto gift of public money in violation of the\nCalifornia Constitution.\n       This contention still does not account for the fact that, once loaned, the money in\nthe RDA’s coffers was an RDA asset. Neither the Utility, nor its ratepayers, retained any\npossessory interest in the money lent. As the trial court found: “Section 34171 does not\ntake money from the ratepayers. The Dissolution Law only reallocates the former RDA’s\ntax increment and assets to other local entities.”\n       D. Unlawful Takings\n       The City contends the Department’s actions result in unlawful takings. The\nDepartment’s actions took money from the RDA, a government entity. No private\ninterests are harmed by such action. As we recently emphasized: “The Legislature is\nfree, within the confines of the California Constitution, to reconfigure and redistribute\nauthority to its subdivisions as it chooses.” (Emeryville, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at p.\n312; see Star-Kist Foods, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles (1986) 42 Cal.3d 1, 6; Mallon v.\nCity of Long Beach (1955) 44 Cal.2d 199, 209.) This includes the power to reallocate\npublic money, again, within the confines of the limitations in the California Constitution.\nBut no taking of private property--money or an uncollected debt--has occurred in this\ncase, where one political subdivision disgorges assets to another political subdivision.\n       In the trial court, the City conceded “the federal and state contracts clauses do not\nforbid the impairment of loans among the City, [the Utility, and the RDA].” But in its\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\freply brief, the City claims standing to sue on behalf of the ratepayers as the trustee of\nthe water and light funds, citing various cases.\n       For example, Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 660 involved a\ncity’s defensive equal protection challenge to a statute that required changes in local\nvoting to eliminate alleged systemic discrimination. (Id. at pp. 671-676.) The court held:\n“The point of the no-standing rule is to prevent local governments, whether as plaintiffs\nor defendants, from using certain provisions of the federal Constitution to obtain\ninvalidation of laws passed by their creator, the state. This notion has no application\nwhere the truly interested parties—citizens or constituents of the local government\nentity—undisputedly do have standing and the entity merely asserts rights on their\nbehalf.” (Id. at p. 676, italics added; see Central Delta Water Agency v. State Water\nResources Control Bd. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 621, 630 [entity may challenge “statute or\nregulation on behalf of its constituents where the constituents’ rights . . . are ‘inextricably\nbound up with’ the subdivision’s duties under its enabling statutes”].)\n       This case implicates the emphasized language of Sanchez: The City, wearing the\nmantle of trustee of the Utility funds, seeks to use the interests of ratepayers as a shield to\nthwart its creator’s effort to dissolve redevelopment agencies. However, unlike in\nSanchez, the affected ratepayers are not interested parties herein. They long ago paid\ntheir utility bills and received the services for which they paid. The Utility then lent\nsome of its money to the RDA, receiving in return a promise to repay the loan--a promise\nthat proved riskier than anticipated. Because the money in the RDA coffers was not\nsegregated, and the RDA had no obligation to repay the loans (other than the contractual\nobligation to the Utility), we fail to see how current ratepayers can advance a\nconstitutional takings claim, let alone how the City can advance such a claim on their\nbehalf. As the trial court pointed out, if the ratepayers “have any claim, it is against the\nCity in loaning the ratepayer fees to the RDA, not against the State for dissolving the\nRDA.”\n\n                                              12\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.

Proc, § 1085). The petition sought to compel the director of the Department\nof Finance (Department) to recognize as enforceable certain obligations between the City\nand the Utility. These consisted of loans from the Utility to the City’s former\nredevelopment agency (RDA). The City asserts the invalidation of these loans in effect\nharms the Utility’s ratepayers and therefore is unlawful for various reasons. The trial\ncourt rejected the City’s view, and the City timely appeals from the ensuing judgment.\n        We agree with the trial court that once Utility money was loaned to the RDA, it\nceased to be “ratepayer money.” Because the City’s legal claims hinge on a contrary\nview--whether or not explicitly acknowledged in its briefing--each of the City’s claims\nfail.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n        1. Redevelopment Agencies Generally\n        The Community Redevelopment Law was adopted to address post-World War II\nurban blight, by allowing the formation of redevelopment agencies to make municipal\nimprovements via “tax increment” funding, which reallocated tax revenues; however,\nover time concerns grew that abuses were occurring. (See California Redevelopment\nAssn. v. Matosantos (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245-248 (Matosantos); City of Emeryville v.\nCohen (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297-298 (Emeryville).)\n        Amid a fiscal crisis in 2011, the Legislature adopted the dissolution law via\nstatutes “that barred any new redevelopment agency obligations, and established\nprocedures for the windup and dissolution of the obligations of the nearly 400\n\n                                              2\n\fredevelopment agencies then existing.” (Pasadena, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1462-\n1463; see Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 241.) Our Supreme Court invalidated a\nportion of the law, but upheld provisions requiring windup and dissolution of\nredevelopment agencies, as provided by the Health and Safety Code.1 (Matosantos,\nsupra, 53 Cal.4th at pp. 274-276.)\n        The dissolution law provides that successor agencies shall “[e]xpeditiously wind\ndown” the redevelopment agency under “direction of the oversight board.” (§ 34177,\nsubd. (h).) Oversight boards consist of appointed members (§ 34179, subd. (a)), and have\na fiduciary duty towards “holders of enforceable obligations and the taxing entities that\nbenefit from distributions of property tax” (§ 34179, subd. (i)), including the duty to\nreview actions by successor agencies, such as “[e]stablishment of the Recognized\nObligation Payment Schedule.” (§ 34180, subd. (g).) The recognized obligation\npayment schedule (ROPS) sets forth remaining “enforceable obligations” as defined\n(§ 34171, subd. (h)) and allows for review to ensure accuracy. (See Emeryville, supra,\n233 Cal.App.4th at pp. 298-299.)\n        2. The Loans Herein\n        There are no relevant factual disputes about the loans at issue, and the trial court\nprepared a thorough statement of facts from which we borrow liberally.\n        The City, the Utility, and the RDA, were governed by the same five elected city\ncouncil members, and at oral argument on the petition the trial court referenced the “three\ndifferent hats” worn. Our Supreme Court has noted that “the Legislature could well\nrecognize that because of the conjoined nature of the governing boards of redevelopment\nagencies and their community sponsors, [obligations between them] often were not the\nproduct of arm’s-length transactions.” (Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 258, fn. 12.)\n\n\n\n\n1   All undesignated statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code.\n\n                                               3\n\fThe City is the successor agency to the RDA, bestowing yet another “hat” on city council\nmembers. We refer to the City when referencing actions taken by city council members\nin their capacity as the successor agency.2\n       The Utility provides water and electricity within the City and to some users\noutside the City. The Utility and City act jointly. The Utility “sets rates and collects\nmoney from its ratepayers in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of providing utility\nservices. It is financially self-sufficient, receiving no money from the City general fund\nor local taxes. The money generated . . . is held in two separate enterprise funds: the\nLight Fund and the Water Fund.” The Utility made six loans to the RDA, “totaling\nnearly $8 million over the last two decades: four loans from the Light Fund and two\nloans from the Water Fund. The first loan was made in 1988, and the last in 2011. By\n2012, none of the loans had been repaid; the outstanding principal and interest was over\n$10 million.” (Fn. omitted.) “It appears no payments were made on three of the loans,”\napproximately $6,600 was paid on one loan, and “[s]ignificant payments were made on\nthe other two loans . . . although significant amounts remained due.”3\n\n\n\n\n2 The fact the city council members wear four hats does not of itself infer impropriety.\n“It is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed.” (Evid. Code, § 664; see\nEmeryville, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at pp. 302-303.)\n3 The trial court interpreted a local ordinance to permit the Utility to loan money to the\nCity, but implied this did not permit loans to the RDA, and noted this “emphasizes the\n‘conjoined nature’ of the City and the RDA.” The City argues it should be accorded\ndeference in interpreting its own ordinances. The Department asserts all the loans were\nunauthorized by the ordinance, and also asserts that the Water Fund loans were unlawful\nunder Proposition 218. Because this action does not seek to invalidate the loans as ultra\nvires or otherwise, and we resolve it on other grounds, we do not address this dispute.\nThe trial court also addressed a seventh loan, whereby the City loaned sales and use taxes\nto the RDA in 1988. However, the City has not made any arguments about this seventh\nloan, abandoning any claims about it. (See Meddock v. County of Yolo (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175, fn. 2.)\n\n                                              4\n\f       The Department rejected these loans on the City’s ROPS, based on section 34171,\nsubdivision (d)(2), providing “ ‘enforceable obligation’ does not include any agreements,\ncontracts, or arrangements between the city . . . that created the redevelopment agency\nand the former redevelopment agency.” The Department found the Utility was the City\nfor purposes of the dissolution law because it is “controlled by” the City. (See\n§ 34167.10, subds. (a)(3); Stats. 2012, ch. 26, § 5.)\n       The Department issued a “finding of completion,” meaning the loans may be\nrepaid if the oversight board finds they were for legitimate redevelopment purposes. (See\n§ 34191.4, subd. (b)(1).) But if that happens, the interest rate would be recalculated, and\n20 percent of the loan repayment would be transferred to the “Low and Moderate Income\nHousing Asset Fund.” (See § 34191.4, subd. (b)(2).)\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       The City heads four multi-faceted claims why it was improper for the Department\nto refuse to treat the Utility loans as enforceable obligations of the City, acting as the\nRDA’s successor agency: (1) The effect of the Department’s actions is to divert special\nfunds for an unlawful purpose; (2) the Department is unlawfully compelling increased\ntaxes; (3) the Department is effecting an unlawful gift of public funds; and (4) the\nDepartment’s actions will result in unlawful takings.\n       As we shall explain (part I, post), the factual predicate--implicit or explicit--for\neach of these legal claims is that some assets held by the RDA retained the character of\nbeing ratepayer assets, because those assets came from the Utility’s Light Fund or Water\nFund. However, as the trial court found, this factual predicate is incorrect: As money\nwas loaned to the RDA, it became an RDA asset, and therefore was subject to legislative\ndisposition via the dissolution law. We shall then explain (part II, post), why each of the\nCity’s legal claims falters because of the failure of its factual predicate.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f                                              I\n                              RDA Assets as Ratepayer Assets\n       The City attacks the trial court’s central finding that the RDA assets from the loans\nare not ratepayer assets. The City asserts the trial court was wrong, because the loans on\nthe books were liabilities of the RDA, not assets, and the dissolution law could not cancel\nthose liabilities to the detriment of the ratepayers. We disagree.\n       When the Utility loaned money to the RDA, the RDA took possession of the\nmoney, and the Utility received a promise of repayment. But the money was an RDA\nasset, whether it defaulted on the loan or not. All loans are potentially subject to default.4\nOn the effective date of the dissolution law, the RDA was in possession of that money, or\nwhatever objects or interests it had acquired by spending some or all of that money. The\ndissolution law specifies how all of the assets held by the RDA were to be reallocated,\nand sets forth detailed definitions of which obligations would and would not be treated as\n“enforceable” obligations. The dissolution law does not provide for tracing RDA assets\nso as to determine their source.\n       The “freeze” portion of the dissolution law “is intended to preserve, to the\nmaximum extent possible, the revenues and assets of redevelopment agencies so that\nthose assets and revenues that are not needed to pay for enforceable obligations may be\nused by local governments to fund core governmental services . . . . All provisions of this\n\n\n\n\n4 We note that each of the five operative promissory notes in the record is captioned as\nan “unsecured” note, although anticipated payments would come from tax increment\nrevenue and other sources. The other note is not in the record, and although the RDA and\nCity resolutions pertaining to that loan spoke of a “secured” loan, it appears that merely\nreferred to the practice of anticipating RDA loans would be repaid via tax increment\nrevenue. Absent review of the note itself, we do not infer it was a “secured” note in the\nordinary sense that specific property or assets guaranteed the loan, nor does the City\nclaim the notes were so secured.\n\n                                              6\n\fpart shall be so construed as broadly as possible to support this intent and to restrict the\nexpenditure of funds to the fullest extent possible.” (§ 34167, subd. (a).)\n       The “dissolution” portion “requires successor agencies to continue to make\npayments and perform existing [enforceable] obligations. [Citation.] However,\nunencumbered balances of redevelopment agency funds must be remitted to the county\nauditor-controller for distribution to cities, the county, special districts, and school\ndistricts in proportion to what each agency would have received absent the\nredevelopment agencies. [Citations.] Proceeds from redevelopment agency asset sales\nlikewise must go to the county auditor-controller for similar distribution. [Citation.]\nFinally, tax increment revenues that would have gone to redevelopment agencies must be\ndeposited in a local trust fund each county is required to create and administer.\n[Citations.] All amounts necessary to satisfy administrative costs, pass-through\npayments, and enforceable obligations will be allocated for those purposes, while any\nexcess will be deemed property tax revenue and distributed in the same fashion as\nbalances and assets.” (Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 251.) One section in this part\nof the dissolution law provides that “All assets, properties, contracts, leases, books and\nrecords, buildings, and equipment of the former redevelopment agency are transferred . . .\nto the control of the successor agency, for administration pursuant to the provisions of\nthis part. . . . Any legal or contractual restrictions on the use of these funds or assets shall\nalso be transferred to the successor agency.” (§ 34175, subd. (b), italics added.) “All\nassets” under this statute plainly encompasses loaned money. And although the RDA had\na contractual obligation to repay the loans, none of the money lent was restricted, that is,\nthe City makes no claim that the RDA was prevented from using any of the money lent in\nany particular way.\n       Thus, it is incumbent on the City to identify any provision of the comprehensive\nand detailed dissolution law that makes enforceable the particular loans at issue in this\ncase, and it has not attempted to do so. Instead, the City insists that on the effective date\n\n                                               7\n\fof the dissolution law, the RDA possessed certain types of assets that were not subject to\ndisposition by that law, because those assets, due to the encumbrance, actually belonged\nto the Utility’s ratepayers. The City has provided no authority for this proposition,\nwhich undermines the purpose of the dissolution law, namely, to dispose of all assets\n(§ 34175, subd. (b)) held by the RDA.\n       What the dissolution law does provide, in part, is that “ ‘enforceable obligation’\ndoes not include any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city . . . that\ncreated the [RDA] and the former [RDA].” (§ 34171, subd. (d)(2).) As the trial court\nfound, the loans from the Utility to the City constitute “agreements, contracts, or\narrangements” between the City (acting as its controlled Utility) and the City’s RDA.\n       Thus, we uphold the trial court’s finding that no ratepayer money was diverted\nwhen the Department sought to implement the dissolution law. As stated, the Legislature\nwanted to divert all RDA assets, while specifying which RDA obligations remained\nenforceable. Under section 34171, subdivision (d)(2), the trial court properly denied the\nCity’s mandamus petition seeking to treat the debts from the Utility loans that remained\non the RDA’s books on the effect date of the dissolution law as enforceable obligations.\n                                             II\n                                  The City’s Legal Claims\n       We now examine the City’s legal claims seriatim. In doing so, “we are mindful\nthat ‘all intendments favor the exercise of the Legislature’s plenary authority: “If there is\nany doubt as to the Legislature’s power to act in any given case, the doubt should be\nresolved in favor of the Legislature’s action. Such restrictions and limitations [imposed\nby the Constitution] are to be construed strictly, and are not to be extended to include\nmatters not covered by the language used.” ’ ” (Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 253;\nsee Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v.

Diverting Special Funds\n       The City contends the effect of the Department’s actions is to divert special funds\nfor an unrelated and, hence, unlawful purpose. We disagree.\n       Generally speaking legislation cannot permanently divert special funds to\nunrelated purposes, although legislation allowing or requiring loans of such money is\npermitted.

But, contrary to the City’s view, nothing in the dissolution law\ndiverted any money from those funds. The Legislature did not divert any money from the\nUtility funds. That money was diverted by the city council years earlier when it loaned\nmoney from the Utility to the RDA. Accordingly, we reject the City’s legal claims about\ndiversion of special funds.\n       B. Change in Statute Triggering a Higher Tax\n       The City next contends the Department is unlawfully compelling increased taxes.\nIt reasons that because the loans will not be paid off, Utility rates will have to be raised\nand therefore, as applied to these facts, the dissolution law increases taxes (as broadly\ndefined as discussed post); however, it is uncontested that the dissolution law did not pass\nby the two-thirds margin necessary to raise taxes.\n       The dissolution law did not increase taxes nor will it result in any tax increase,\nwhich under Propositions 218 and 26 is defined to include certain government charges\nwhether or not denominated as a tax, and require voter approval therefor.

The Legislature plays no role in rate setting by municipal utilities.\n       If the residents of the City believe the unpaid loans have depleted the Utility’s\nfunds to the extent that a tax increase is required to ensure appropriate services, they are\nfree to enact such an increase. But the dissolution law will not, of itself, result in an\nincrease.5\n       C Gift of Public Funds\n       The City contends the Department is compelling an unlawful gift of public funds.\nWe disagree with this view.\n       With exceptions not relevant, “The Legislature shall have no power . . . to make\nany gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any\nindividual, municipal or other corporation whatever.” (Cal. Const., Art. XVI, § 6.) In\npart, as the City argues, this provision prohibits taking funds from one group of taxpayers\nand transferring them to benefit another group of taxpayers unless the funds are used to\nfurther the purpose of the donor entity. (See California Redevelopment Assn. v.\nMatosantos (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The City emphasizes that the money came from the Utility’s water and light\nfunds, and argues the Legislature has in effect taken ratepayer money from some users--\n\n\n\n\n5We observe that the trial court found: “Some of these loans were made almost two\ndecades ago, yet no payments had been made by the time the RDA was dissolved.\nDespite having lost the use of this money for decades, the City has not yet had to raise\nutility rates.”\n\n                                              10\n\fincluding some outside of the City--and “given” it to “the beneficiaries” of the City’s\nredevelopment projects. The City further observes that, generally speaking, the\ncancellation of a debt may equate to a “gift” within the meaning of the constitutional\nproscription against gifts of public funds. (See Westly v. U.S. Bancorp. (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2295709\"><a href=\"/opinion/2295709/westly-v-us-bancorp/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The City argues the Utility could not have given the money to the\nRDA, but was required to loan it, to avoid the gift proscription, therefore legislative\ninvalidation of those loans results in a de facto gift of public money in violation of the\nCalifornia Constitution.\n       This contention still does not account for the fact that, once loaned, the money in\nthe RDA’s coffers was an RDA asset. Neither the Utility, nor its ratepayers, retained any\npossessory interest in the money lent. As the trial court found: “Section 34171 does not\ntake money from the ratepayers. The Dissolution Law only reallocates the former RDA’s\ntax increment and assets to other local entities.”\n       D. Unlawful Takings\n       The City contends the Department’s actions result in unlawful takings. The\nDepartment’s actions took money from the RDA, a government entity. No private\ninterests are harmed by such action. As we recently emphasized: “The Legislature is\nfree, within the confines of the California Constitution, to reconfigure and redistribute\nauthority to its subdivisions as it chooses.” (Emeryville, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at p.\n312; see Star-Kist Foods, Inc. v.

This includes the power to reallocate\npublic money, again, within the confines of the limitations in the California Constitution.\nBut no taking of private property--money or an uncollected debt--has occurred in this\ncase, where one political subdivision disgorges assets to another political subdivision.\n       In the trial court, the City conceded “the federal and state contracts clauses do not\nforbid the impairment of loans among the City, [the Utility, and the RDA].” But in its\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\freply brief, the City claims standing to sue on behalf of the ratepayers as the trustee of\nthe water and light funds, citing various cases.\n       For example, Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247643\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247643/sanchez-v-city-of-modesto/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Id. at pp. 671-676.) The court held:\n“The point of the no-standing rule is to prevent local governments, whether as plaintiffs\nor defendants, from using certain provisions of the federal Constitution to obtain\ninvalidation of laws passed by their creator, the state. This notion has no application\nwhere the truly interested parties—citizens or constituents of the local government\nentity—undisputedly do have standing and the entity merely asserts rights on their\nbehalf.” (Id. at p. 676, italics added; see Central Delta Water Agency v. State Water\nResources Control Bd. (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256828/central-delta-water-agency-v-st-water-res-ctrl-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However, unlike in\nSanchez, the affected ratepayers are not interested parties herein. They long ago paid\ntheir utility bills and received the services for which they paid. The Utility then lent\nsome of its money to the RDA, receiving in return a promise to repay the loan--a promise\nthat proved riskier than anticipated. Because the money in the RDA coffers was not\nsegregated, and the RDA had no obligation to repay the loans (other than the contractual\nobligation to the Utility), we fail to see how current ratepayers can advance a\nconstitutional takings claim, let alone how the City can advance such a claim on their\nbehalf. As the trial court pointed out, if the ratepayers “have any claim, it is against the\nCity in loaning the ratepayer fees to the RDA, not against the State for dissolving the\nRDA.”\n\n                                              12\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed. The plaintiffs shall pay the Department’s costs of this\nappeal. (See Cal.
