One appeal originated in the District Court of the\n\nVirgin Islands at docket number 95-7354.      The other two appeals\n\npertaining to the same Delaware defendant originated in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\fDistrict Court of Delaware at docket numbers 96-7529 and 96-\n\n7530.1\n\n          We scheduled oral argument in all three appeals on the\n\nsame day inasmuch as they raised the same question - should this\n\ncourt recognize a parent-child privilege?     The Delaware appeals\n\nalso challenge the adequacy of a Schofield affidavit and charge\n\nthat the in camera ex parte proceeding permitted by the district\n\ncourt constituted a deprivation of due process.     We answer the\n\nquestions presented by holding that a parent-child privilege\n\nshould not be recognized, and we affirm the district court's\n\nrulings which rejected the appellants' objections to the\n\nSchofield affidavit and in camera ex parte proceeding.\n\n\n                               I.\n\n          The facts and procedure of the Virgin Islands case\n\ngiving rise to one appeal, and of the Delaware case giving rise\n\nto two appeals, will be stated separately.2\n\n\n\n1. Throughout this opinion, where separate identification of the\nappeals is appropriate, we will refer to the appeal which came\nfrom the District Court of the Virgin Islands as the \"Virgin\nIslands appeal\" and the appeals from the District of Delaware as\nthe \"Delaware appeals\".\n\n2. Due to the nature of the proceedings, the district courts in\nboth matters impounded the entire record in each case to protect\nthe privacy interests of the parties. Consequently, we do not\nidentify by name either the father or the son who is the target\nof the grand jury investigation in the Virgin Islands case; nor\nthe daughter or the father who is the target of the grand jury\ninvestigation in the Delaware case.\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\f           Docket Number 95-7354: In the Virgin Islands case, the\n\ngrand jury sitting in St. Croix subpoenaed the father of the\n\ntarget of the grand jury investigation as a witness.3     The target\n\nof the grand jury proceeding was the son of the subpoenaed\n\nwitness.   The son became the target of a government investigation\n\nas a result of \"certain transactions that [he] was allegedly\n\ninvolved in.\"   Tr. at 11.   At the time of the alleged\n\ntransactions, the son was eighteen years old.\n\n           The grand jury subpoenaed the target's father to\n\ntestify on April 18, 1995.    The father, a former FBI agent, lived\n\nwith his wife and son in St. Croix.     On April 17, 1995, based on\n\nhis belief that the grand jury intended to question him about\n\nconversations that he had had with his son, the father moved to\n\nquash the subpoena, asserting that those conversations were\n\nprivileged from disclosure under Fed. R. Evid. 501.\n\n           The father testified, at a hearing before the district\n\ncourt, that he and his son \"ha[d] an excellent relationship, very\n\nclose, very loving relationship.\"    Tr. at 4.   He further\n\ntestified that if he were coerced into testifying against his\n\nson, \"[their] relationship would dramatically change and the\n\ncloseness that [they] have would end . . . .\"    Id. at 5.    The\n\n\n\n\n3. The term of the grand jury in the Virgin Islands case was to\nhave ended on September 17, 1996. However, by Order of the\nDistrict Court of the Virgin Islands entered on September 3,\n1996, the term was extended until March 17, 1997.\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\ffather further explained that the subpoena would impact\n\nnegatively upon his relationship with his son:\nI will be living under a cloud in which if my son comes to me or\n          talks to me, I've got to be very careful what he says,\n          what I allow him to say. I would have to stop him and\n          say, \"you can't talk to me about that. You've got to\n          talk to your attorney.\" It's no way for anybody to\n          live in this country.\n\n\nId. at 6.\n\n            On June 19, 1995, the district court entered its order\n\ndenying the father's motion to quash.    On the same day, the\n\ndistrict court granted the targeted son's motion to intervene and\n\nthen stayed its order which denied the quashing of the father's\n\nsubpoena pending any appeal.   The court's memorandum opinion and\n\norder, although clearly sympathetic with the plight of the\n\nsubpoenaed father, \"regretfully decline[d] to recognize [a\n\nparent-child] privilege\" because the Third Circuit had yet to\n\naddress the issue and \"every United States Court of Appeals that\n\nhas confronted this question has declined to recognize the\n\nparent-child privilege.\"   In re Grand Jury Proceeding, Misc. No.\n\n95-0009, at 14 (D.V.I. June 19, 1995).    Appeal of the June 19,\n\n1995 order was promptly taken by the targeted son on June 22,\n\n1995.4\n\n\n\n4. The original appeal in the Virgin Islands case was heard in\nSt. Thomas by a panel of this court of which Judge Sarokin was a\nmember. Prior to the filing of an opinion, Judge Sarokin retired\nfrom office and Judge Greenberg replaced him on the panel. Panel\nrehearing was ordered.\n\n\n\n                                    6\n\f          Docket Numbers 96-7529 & 96-7530:    In the Delaware\n\ncase, a sixteen year old minor daughter was subpoenaed to testify\n\nbefore the grand jury, as part of an investigation into her\n\nfather's participation in an alleged interstate kidnapping of a\n\nwoman who had disappeared.     The daughter was scheduled to\n\ntestify on September 10, 1996.    However, on September 9, 1996, a\n\nmotion to quash subpoena was made by counsel for the daughter and\n\nher mother, as well as by separate counsel for the father.5\n\n          The motion sought to bar the testimony of the daughter\n\nclaiming a parent-child privilege which would cover testimony and\n\nconfidential communications.     \"[T]he privilege [was] claimed for\n\nconfidential communications as well as for protection against\n\nbeing compelled to testify in a criminal proceeding\".    Joint\n\nMotion to Quash Subpoena at ¶ 5.\n\n          The district court held a hearing during the morning of\n\nSeptember 10, 1996; ordered further briefing due that afternoon6;\n\nand issued a ruling in the late afternoon denying the motion to\n\n5. It appears that although the mother and father of the minor\nwitness have taken similar positions in this litigation, albeit\nby different counsel, at the time of these proceedings, they were\nseparated.\n\n6. The additional briefing was on the issue of whether the\ndaughter's testimony would be material and non-duplicative.\nDuring the hearing, the district court placed the burden on the\ngovernment to make a substantial showing that this threshold was\nmet. The government filed a Schofield affidavit, see infra, and\nvolunteered to furnish further particulars at an in camera ex\nparte hearing. The parents and daughter opposed the in camera ex\nparte proceeding, arguing that if they were foreclosed from\nlistening to the government's proffer, there would be no basis\nupon which they could rebut the evidence presented.\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\fquash and ordering the minor daughter to testify before the grand\n\njury that evening.\n\n          In the order, the district court reasoned that, because\n\nthere is \"no recognized familial privilege\", the appropriate\n\nprocess for determining whether to grant the motion to quash was\n\n\"to weigh the competing interests of the parties in order to\n\ndetermine whether the anticipated testimony of the minor child is\n\nmaterial and nonduplicative, thus tipping the scales toward\n\nrequiring the testimony\".   In re Grand Jury, 96-cv-51, at 1 (D.\n\nDel. September 10, 1996).   The district court concluded that,\n\nbased on the government's in camera ex parte proffer, \"the\n\ngovernment's interests in compelling the testimony outweigh the\n\nprivacy interests asserted by the moving parties\" and denied the\n\nmotion to quash on those grounds.   See id. at 2.\n\n          Pursuant to the court order, the daughter appeared at\n\ncourt (in an ante-room to the grand jury courtroom) in the\n\nevening of September 10, 1995.   She refused to testify and was\n\nfound in contempt.   The district court then stayed the imposition\n\nof sanctions during the pendency of these appeals.   Appeal of the\n\nSeptember 10, 1996 order was promptly made in joint motions by\n\nmother and daughter, and father on September 13, 1996.7\n\n\n\n7. The appeals in the Delaware case were expedited by this court\nso that the common issue of parent-child privilege could be heard\nand resolved in the Delaware and Virgin Island cases at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\f          The district courts had jurisdiction over both the\n\nVirgin Islands case and Delaware case under 18 U.S.C. § 3231.    We\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction over the appeals taken by the\n\nintervenors pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.    See Perlman v. United\n\nStates, 247 U.S. 7, 12-13 (1918); In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n(C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc.), 619 F.2d 1022, 1024 (3d Cir. 1980).\n\nIn addition, in the Delaware case, the daughter appealed on her\n\nown behalf after being cited for contempt, providing separate\n\ngrounds for jurisdiction.   See Cobbledick v. United States, 309\n\nU.S. 323 (1940); Alexander v. United States, 201 U.S. 117 (1906);\n\nIn re Grand Jury Proceedings, 619 F.2d at 1024.\n\n          Our review as to all issues, is plenary.\n\n\n                                II.\n\n         Because we find little merit in the arguments advanced\n\nin the Delaware case pertaining to the Schofield affidavit and\n\nthe in camera proceeding before the district court, we will\n\ndispose of these two issues first and without substantial\n\ndiscussion.   We then will turn to the more pressing issue of\n\nwhether we should be the first federal Court of Appeals to\n\nrecognize a parent-child privilege.\n\n          We have held that, when a subpoena for purposes of a\n\ngrand jury proceeding is challenged, the government is \"required\n\nto make some preliminary showing by affidavit that each item is\n\nat least relevant to an investigation being conducted by the\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\fgrand jury and properly within its jurisdiction, and is not\n\nsought primarily for another purpose.\"    In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings, 486 F.2d 85, 93 (3d Cir. 1973) (Schofield I); see\n\nalso In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 507 F.2d 963, 966 (3d Cir.)\n\n(Schofield II) (identifying this burden of proof as a \"three-\n\npronged showing requirement\"), cert. denied sub nom. Schofield v.\n\nUnited States, 421 U.S. 1015 (1975).     This requirement stems from\n\nthe Schofield cases (I and II) where the targeted defendant had\n\nrefused to furnish handwriting exemplars and had refused to allow\n\nher fingerprints and photograph to be taken.    We have commonly\n\nreferred to such an affidavit as a Schofield affidavit.8\n\n          Appellants in the Delaware case argue that the\n\ngovernment's Schofield affidavit9 was insufficient since it was\n\n\"simply a mere recitation of the requirements, rather than a\n\nsubstantive document and was not sufficient to enable the\n\nDistrict Court to properly balance the interests of the parties.\"\n\n Brief of Appellant Doe #1 at 21.   They argue further that \"The\n\nGovernment's affidavit does not meet. . . [the Schofield II]\n\ntest. . . It is written in conclusory terms and makes no effort\n8. In Schofield II, we held that the affidavit complying with\nthis three-pronged requirement sufficed to meet the government's\nburden and hence we upheld the government's subpoena. See\nSchofield II, 507 F.2d at 963.\n\n9. The affidavit stated that the daughter's testimony would be\n\"essential and necessary\" and \"relevant\" to the grand jury\ninvestigation; that the testimony was \"properly within the Grand\nJury's jurisdiction\" and was \"not sought primarily for any other\npurpose\". Government's Response to Joint Motion to Quash\nSubpoena at ¶ 4.\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\fto state any facts at all. .    . More should be required where the\n\nGovernment seeks to place a child in a Grand Jury proceeding...\"\n\nBrief of Appellant Doe #2 at 25.\n\n            Our review of the affidavit presented by the government\n\nin the present matter satisfies us that it contained the\n\nrequisite elements as mandated in Schofield II.   It \"provide[s] a\n\nminimum disclosure of the grand jury's purpose\" by demonstrating\n\nthat the daughter's testimony would be \"at least relevant to an\n\ninvestigation being conducted by the grand jury and properly\n\nwithin its jurisdiction, and is not sought primarily for another\n\npurpose\".    Schofield II, 507 F.2d at 965 (citing Schofield I,\n\n486 F.2d at 93).     These elements satisfy the minimal disclosure\n\nrequirements of Schofield II.\n\n            The district court could, of course, in its discretion,\n\nrequire additional information.    See Schofield II, 507 F.2d at\n\n965.   Here the district court exercised its discretion by not\n\nrequiring anything additional in the affidavit, but decided\n\ninstead to hold a hearing on the government's proffer and to do\n\nso in camera and ex parte.\n\n            We hold that the government met its burden of proof\n\nwith regard to the adequacy of the Schofield affidavit, and since\nthe appellants have not demonstrated that the affidavit was\n\ninsufficient or that there was an abuse of the grand jury\n\nprocess, we are persuaded that the district court did not err in\n\nfinding the Schofield affidavit proper.   See Schofield I, 486\n\n\n\n                                    11\n\fF.2d at 92 (\"the party objecting to the enforcement has the\n\nburden of making some showing of irregularity\"); Schofield II,\n\n507 F.2d at 965 (\"the burden is generally on the witness to show\n\nabuse of the grand jury process\").\n\n          Appellants next argue that the district court erred in\n\nconducting the in camera hearing ex parte.   They contend that\n\nthey were prejudiced by their inability to respond to the\n\ngovernment's proffer and that therefore their due process rights\n\nwere violated.10   We cannot agree.\n\n          District courts have considerable discretion in\n\ndetermining whether additional proceedings - beyond the Schofield\n\naffidavit - are warranted, including in camera hearings.     See\n\nSchofield I, 486 F.2d at 93; see generally United States v.\n\nZolin, 491 U.S. 554, 572 (1988).\n\n          The purpose of the in camera hearing was to aid the\n\ndistrict court in balancing the government's need for the\n\ndaughter's testimony against the privacy concerns of the daughter\n\nand her family.    The district court placed a threshold burden on\n\nthe government to demonstrate the materiality and non-duplicative\n\nnature of the daughter's testimony, in order that it could\n\ndetermine whether the testimony was necessary for the grand jury\n\nproceedings, or whether instead, it should grant appellants'\n\nmotion to quash.\n10. Appellants cite 18 U.S.C. § 3509(a)(2) (Supp. 1996) as\nsupport for their argument; however, we note that this provision,\nconcerning child abuse, has no relevance to the present matter.\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f          The government's proffer was presented in camera and\n\nheard ex parte in order to protect the confidentiality of the\n\ngrand jury proceeding.   Ex parte in camera hearings have been\n\nheld proper in order to preserve the ongoing interest in grand\n\njury secrecy.   See generally In re Marc Rich & Co., 707 F.2d 663,\n\n670 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1215 (1983); In re Grand\n\nJury Matter (Catania), 682 F.2d 61, 66 (3d Cir. 1982).      The\n\nsecrecy of the grand jury proceedings in the present matter might\n\nhave been compromised by divulging the specific questions that\n\nthe government intended to ask during the daughter's testimony.\n\nJudicial supervision and interference with grand jury proceedings\n\nshould always be kept to a minimum.      See, e.g., United States v.\n\nWilliams, 504 U.S. 36, 50 (1992).\n\n          After reviewing the government's in camera proffer, the\n\ndistrict court judge denied the motion to quash, having\n\ndetermined that the daughter's testimony would be material and\n\nnon-duplicative, and that \"the government's interests in\n\ncompelling the testimony outweigh the privacy interests asserted\n\nby the moving party\".    In re Grand Jury, 96-cv-51, at ¶ 3 (D.\n\nDel. September 10, 1996).   We hold that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in hearing the government's proffer in\ncamera and ex parte.11\n\n11. In her dissenting and concurring opinion, Judge Mansmann\nregisters disturbance because of the Schofield procedure employed\nby the district court. See Dissenting Opinion at 20-21.\n          We are bound by Schofield. See I.O.P. § 9.1. The\ndistrict court judge adhered to our Schofield instruction and\nproperly exercised her discretion in holding an in camera ex\n\n\n                                    13\n\f                                III.\n\n            The central question in these appeals is one of first\n\nimpression in this court: should we recognize a parent-child\n\ntestimonial privilege?   Appellants argue that recognition is\n\nnecessary in order to advance important public policy interests\n\nsuch as the protection of strong and trusting parent-child\n\nrelationships; the preservation of the family; safeguarding of\n\nprivacy interests and protection from harmful government\n\nintrusion; and the promotion of healthy psychological development\n\nof children.    See Brief of Appellant in Virgin Islands case at 8-\n\n9; Brief of Appellant Doe #1 at 9-14; Brief of Appellant Doe #2\n\nat 10-20.    These public policy arguments echo those advanced by\n\nacademicians and other legal commentators in the myriad of law\n\nreview articles discussing the parent-child testimonial\n\nprivilege.12\n(..continued)\nparte hearing which we have found to be within the Schofield\ndoctrine. Judge Mansmann's criticism of that procedure is one\nthat can only be remedied by an en banc court.\n\n12.   See, e.g., Yolanda L. Ayala & Thomas C. Martyn, To Tell or\nNot to Tell?

New York is the only state which has a judicially-recognized\nparent-child privilege; however, the privilege has only been\nrecognized by inferior New York courts.\n          Idaho and Minnesota are the only states which have\nrecognized a variant of the parent-child privilege through\nstatute.   See Idaho Code § 9-203(7) (1990 & Supp. 1995); Minn.\nStat. § 595.02(1)(j) (1988 & Supp. 1996).   It is important to\nnote that neither statute is rooted in the common law.\n\n\n                                  15\n\f          (c)No state within the Third Circuit has recognized a\n               parent-child privilege.\n\n(2)No reasoned analysis of Federal Rule of Evidence 501 or of the\n          standards established by the Supreme Court or by this\n          court supports the creation of a privilege.\n\n(3)Creation of such a privilege would have no impact on the\n          parental relationship and hence would neither benefit\n          that relationship nor serve any social policy.\n\n(4)Although we have the authority to recognize a new privilege,\n          we believe the recognition of such a privilege, if one\n          is to be recognized, should be left to Congress.\n\n\nA.FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS HAVE DECLINED TO RECOGNIZE A PARENT-\n     CHILD PRIVILEGE.\n\n     1.Eight Federal Courts of Appeals Have Explicitly Rejected\n          the Privilege and None of the Remaining Courts of\n          Appeals Have Recognized the Privilege.\n\n\n          The appellants rely primarily upon law review articles\n\nrather than case law authority to support the position that a\n\nparent-child testimonial privilege should be recognized.   No case\n\nlaw recognizing such a privilege exists.   On the other hand, the\n\neight federal Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue\n\nhave uniformly declined to recognize a parent-child privilege.\n\n(..continued)\n          Massachusetts law prevents a minor child from\ntestifying against a parent in a criminal proceeding. However,\nthe statute does not go so far as to recognize a parent-child\ntestimonial privilege. First, the Massachusetts statute does not\ncreate a testimonial privilege; rather it is best described as a\nwitness-disqualification rule.   Second, the testimonial bar is\nnot of common-law origin but is statutory. Finally, the statute\nonly bars a minor child, under certain circumstances, from\ntestifying against a parent, and does not extend to children of\nall ages in all circumstances. See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 233, § 20\n(1986 & Supp. 1996).\n\n\n\n                                  16\n\fSee In re Erato, 2 F.3d 11 (2d Cir. 1993); In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings (John Doe), 842 F.2d 244 (10th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n488 U.S. 894 (1988); United States v.

Moreover, the remaining federal\n\nCourts of Appeals that have not explicitly rejected the privilege\n\nhave not chosen to recognize the privilege either.\n\n          Additional federal case law rejecting the privilege can\n\nbe found in district court cases and in related contexts where\n\nthe privilege was disapproved.   See United States v. Duran, 884\n\nF. Supp. 537, 541 (D.D.C. 1995) (\"The general rule in most\n\nfederal courts is that there is no parent-child privilege.\"); In\nre Kinoy, 326 F.

The appellants in In re Inquest Proceedings, 676 A.2d 790\n(Vt. 1996) cited the cases of In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n(Agosto), 553 F. Supp. 1298 (D. Nev. 1983) and People v.\nFitzgerald, 422 N.Y.S.2d 309 (Westchester County Ct. 1979), in\n\n\n                                   19\n\f     3.Only Two Federal District Court Cases Recognize the\n          Privilege, and These Cases are Distinguishable and Not\n          Authoritative.\n\n\n          The parent-child privilege has not been recognized by\n\nany federal or state court with the exception of two federal\n(..continued)\nsupport of their argument that a parent-child privilege should be\nrecognized. The Vermont Supreme Court declined to follow either\ncase: it declined to follow Agosto for much the same reasons as\nwe discuss infra in text, and it declined to follow Fitzgerald\nwhich was limited by People v. Harrell, 450 N.Y.S.2d 501 (N.Y.\nApp. Div. 1982), aff'd, 463 N.Y.S.2d 185 (N.Y. 1983). See infra\nnote 15.\n\n15. New York's inferior courts are the only state courts which\nhave judicially recognized a parent-child privilege. See In re\nMark G., 410 N.Y.S.2d 464 (N.Y. App. Div. 1978); In re A & M, 403\nN.Y.S.2d 375 (N.Y. App. Div. 1978); In re Ryan, 474 N.Y.S.2d 931\n(N.Y. Fam. Ct. 1984); People v. Fitzgerald, 422 N.Y.S.2d 309\n(Westchester County Ct. 1979). The privilege so-recognized is\nessentially derived from New York's constitution. The New York\nAppellate Division explained that the privilege it recognized was\nrooted in the constitutional right to privacy:\n\nNotwithstanding the absence of a statutory privilege, we\n     may, nevertheless, draw from the principles of\n     privileged communications in determining in what manner\n     the protection of the Constitution should be extended\n     to the child-parent communication. . . . We conclude .\n     . . that communications made by a minor child to his\n     parents within the context of the family relationship\n     may, under some circumstances, lie within the 'private\n     realm of family life which the state cannot enter.'\"\n\nIn re A & M, 403 N.Y.S.2d at 381 (quoting Prince v. Massachu-\nsetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944)) (emphasis added); see also\nPeople v. Harrell, 450 N.Y.S.2d 501, 504 (N.Y. App. Civ. 1982)\n(privilege is not rooted in common law, statute, or the 6th\namendment).\n          New York courts apply the parent-child privilege\nsparingly. For example, New York's Court of Appeals declined to\napply the parent-child privilege to a murder confession made by a\n28 year old defendant to his mother, due to defendant's age; lack\nof confidentiality; subject of conversation; and the fact that\nthe mother had already testified in front of grand jury\nproceeding. See People v. Johnson, 644 N.E.2d 1378, 1378 (N.Y.\n1994).\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\fdistrict court cases which are readily distinguishable: In re\n\nGrand Jury Proceedings (Agosto), 553 F. Supp. 1298 (D. Nev. 1983)\n\nand In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Greenberg), 11 Fed. R. Serv.\n\n(Callaghan) 579 (D. Conn. 1982).\n\n          In Agosto, the thirty-two-year-old son of an alleged\n\ntax evader moved to quash a subpoena ad testificandum requiring\n\nhim to testify against his father.    See Agosto, 553 F. Supp. at\n\n1299. Although the district court recognized a common-law\n\nprivilege, it did so in derogation of the prevailing\n\njurisprudence of the Ninth Circuit, which, in an en banc\n\ndecision, had expressly rejected a parent-child privilege.       See\n\nUnited States v. Penn, 647 F.2d 876 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert.\n\ndenied, 449 U.S. 903 (1980).   Agosto therefore conflicts squarely\n\nwith its own circuit's en banc precedent.    It is not surprising\n\nthat in her dissent, Judge Mansmann, although apparently\n\napproving of the reasoning in Agosto and citing to it on pages 11\n\nand 18 n.17, is no more persuaded by Agosto than we are.\n\n          In Greenberg, a mother sought relief from a civil\n\ncontempt charge when she refused to testify before a federal\n\ngrand jury in order to protect her adult daughter, who had been\n\nindicted by a Florida grand jury for importation of marijuana.\n\nSee Greenberg, 11 Fed. R. Serv. at 580.     The district court\n\nrecognized a limited testimonial privilege grounded in the First\n\nAmendment free exercise clause; however, the court declined to\n\nrecognize a general common-law parent-child privilege.\n\n\n\n                                     21\n\f          Observing that the daughter, as an adult, did not\n\nrequire the same degree of guidance and support as a young child,\n\nthe court reasoned that although compelled disclosure of\n\nnonincriminating confidences might damage the relationship\n\nbetween the mother and her daughter, the harm would be less\n\nsevere than if an unemancipated minor were involved.    See id. at\n\n586-87.   Concluding that this lesser degree of harm did not\n\noutweigh the state's need for the testimony, the district court\n\nheld that the facts did not justify the creation of a common-law\n\nparent-child privilege.   See id. at 587.   Greenberg therefore\n\ndoes not support the creation of a general testimonial parent-\n\nchild privilege; furthermore, its limited holding does not extend\n\nto the present matter since religious principles are not\n\nimplicated here.\n\nB.THE STANDARDS PRESCRIBED BY FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 501 DO NOT\n     SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A PRIVILEGE.\n\n\n          Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that \"the privi-\n\nlege of a witness . . . shall be governed by the principles of\n\nthe common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the\n\nUnited States in the light of reason and experience.\"    No such\n\nprinciple, interpretation, reason or experience has been drawn\n\nupon here.\n\n          It is true that Congress, in enacting Fed. R. Evid.\n\n501, \"manifested an affirmative intention not to freeze the law\n\nof privilege.   Its purpose rather was to 'provide the courts with\n\n\n                                   22\n\fthe flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case\n\nbasis,' and to leave the door open to change.\"     Trammel v. United\n\nStates, 445 U.S. 40, 47 (1980) (quoting 102 Cong. Rec. 40,891\n\n(1974) (statement of Rep. William Hungate)).     In doing so,\n\nhowever, we are admonished that privileges are generally\n\ndisfavored;16 that \"'the public . . . has a right to every man's\n\nevidence'\";17 and that privileges are tolerable \"only to the very\n\nlimited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding\n\nrelevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally\n\npredominant principle of utilizing all rational means for\n\nascertaining truth.\"18\n\n          In keeping with these principles, the Supreme Court has\n\nrarely expanded common-law testimonial privileges.19    Following\n\n16. See, e.g., In re Dinnan, 661 F.2d 426, 427 (5th Cir. 1981)\n(\"The basis of justice is truth and our system frowns upon\nimpediments to ascertaining that truth.\"), cert. denied sub nom.\nDinnan v.

See, e.g., Trammel, 445 U.S. at 53 (narrowing husband-wife\nprivilege and holding that witness spouse may testify over the\nobjections of the other spouse); University of Pa. v. EEOC, 493\nU.S. 182, 189 (1990) (declining to recognize a privilege for\nacademic peer review proceedings); United States v. Arthur Young\n& Co., 465 U.S. 805, 817-19 (1984) (rejecting an accountant work-\nproduct privilege); United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 367-\n68 (1980) (expressly refusing to recognize a privilege for state\nlegislators in federal court); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.\n683, 709 (1974) (rejecting a privilege for confidential\ncommunications between the President and the President's high-\nlevel advisors); Couch v. United States, 409 U.S. 322, 335 (1973)\n(rejecting an accountant-client testimonial privilege).\n\n\n\n                                   23\n\fthe Supreme Court's teachings, other federal courts, including\n\nthis court, have likewise declined to exercise their power under\n\nRule 501 expansively.     See, e.g., United States v. Schoenheinz,\n\n548 F.2d 1389, 1390 (9th Cir. 1977) (declining to recognize an\n\nemployer-stenographer privilege); In re Grand Jury Impaneled on\n\nJanuary 21, 1975, 541 F.2d 373, 382 (3d Cir. 1976) (declining to\n\nrecognize a required-reports privilege).\n\n          Neither the appellants nor the dissent has identified\n\nany principle of common law, and hence have proved no\n\ninterpretation of such a principle.       Nor has the dissent or the\n\nappellants discussed any common-law principle in light of reason\n\nand experience.     Accordingly, no basis has been demonstrated for\n\nthis court to adopt a parent-child privilege.\n\nC.CREATING A PARENT-CHILD PRIVILEGE WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH\n     THE TEACHINGS OF THE SUPREME COURT AND OF THIS COURT.\n\n     1.Supreme Court\n\n\n          The Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement in the\n\nlaw of privileges, Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923 (1996),\n\nwhich recognized a psychotherapist-patient privilege, supports\n\nthe conclusion that a privilege should not, and cannot, be\n\ncreated here.     In Jaffee, the Supreme Court reemphasized that the\npredominant common-law principle which guides a federal court's\n\ndetermination of whether a privilege applies is the maxim that\n\ntestimonial privileges are disfavored:\n     The common-law principles underlying the recognition of\n     testimonial privileges can be stated simply. \"'For\n\n\n                                     24\n\f     more than three centuries it has now been recognized as\n     a fundamental maxim that the public . . . has a right\n     to every man's evidence. When we come to examine the\n     various claims of exemption, we start with the primary\n     assumption that there is a general duty to give what\n     testimony one is capable of giving, and that any\n     exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional,\n     being so many derogations from a positive general\n     rule.'\"\n\n\nId. at 1928 (quoting United States v. Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, 331\n\n(1950) (quoting 8 John H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2192, at 64 (3d ed.\n\n1940))).   An exception to this general rule is justified only\n\nwhen recognition of a privilege would promote a \"'public good\n\ntranscending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all\n\nrational means for ascertaining the truth.'\"   Id. (quoting\n\nTrammel, 445 U.S. at 50 (quoting Elkins v. United States, 364\n\nU.S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting))).\n\n           The Jaffee Court emphasized that a court, in determin-\n\ning whether a particular privilege \"'promotes sufficiently\n\nimportant interests to outweigh the need for probative ev-\n\nidence,'\" Id. (quoting Trammel, 445 U.S. at 51), must be guided\n\nby \"reason and experience.\"   Specifically, the Jaffee Court in-\n\nstructed that a federal court should look to the \"experience\" of\n\nstate courts:   \"[T]he policy decision of the States bear on the\n\nquestion [of] whether federal courts should recognize a new\n\nprivilege or amend the coverage of an existing one.\"    Id. at\n1929-30.\n\n           Notably, in recognizing a psychotherapist-patient\n\nprivilege, the Supreme Court relied on the fact that all fifty\n\n\n\n                                   25\n\fstates had enacted some form of a psychotherapist privilege.     Id.\n\nat 1929 & n.11 (listing state statutes).     The Jaffee Court ex-\n\nplained that \"it is appropriate to treat a consistent body of\n\npolicy determinations by state legislatures as reflecting both\n\n'reason' and 'experience.'\"   Id. at 1930.\n\n          Here, by contrast, only four states have deemed it\n\nnecessary to protect from disclosure, in any manner, confidential\n\ncommunications between children and their parents.    As previously\n\nnoted, New York state courts have recognized a limited parent-\n\nchild privilege, and Idaho and Minnesota have enacted limited\n\nstatutory privileges protecting confidential communications by\n\nminors to their parents.   See supra notes 13 & 15.    In\n\nMassachusetts, as we have noted, minor children are statutorily\n\ndisqualified from testifying against their parents in criminal\n\nproceedings.   See id.   No state within the Third Circuit has\n\nadopted a parent-child privilege.\n\n          The policy determinations of these four states do not\n\nconstitute a \"consistent body of policy determinations by\n\nstate[s]\" supporting recognition of a parent-child privilege.\n\nIndeed, if anything, the fact that the overwhelming majority of\n\nstates have chosen not to create a parent-child privilege sup-\nports the opposite conclusion:   \"reason and experience\" dictate\n\nthat federal courts should refuse to recognize a privilege\n\nrejected by the vast majority of jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\f          The Jaffee Court also relied on the fact that the\n\npsychotherapist-patient privilege was among the nine specific\n\nprivileges recommended by the Advisory Committee on Rules of\n\nEvidence in 1972.     See Jaffee, 116 S. Ct. at 1928-30 & n.7; see\n\nalso Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and\n\nMagistrates, 56 F.R.D. 183, 230-61 (1973).    Additionally, the\n\nJaffee Court noted:    \"[O]ur holding [United States v. Gillock,\n\n445 U.S. 360 (1980)] that Rule 501 did not include a state\n\nlegislative privilege relied, in part, on the fact that no such\n\nprivilege was included in the Advisory Committee's draft [of the\n\nproposed privilege rules].\"     Jaffee, 116 S. Ct. at 1930.\n\n          In the instant cases, in contrast to the psychothera-\n\npist-patient privilege recognized in Jaffee, the parent-child\n\nprivilege, like the state legislative privilege rejected in\n\nGillock, was not among the enumerated privileges submitted by the\n\nAdvisory Committee.    Although this fact, in and of itself, is not\n\ndispositive with respect to the question as to whether this court\n\nshould create a privilege, it strongly suggests that the Advisory\n\nCommittee, like the majority of state legislatures, did not\n\nregard confidential parent-child communications sufficiently\n\nimportant to warrant \"privilege\" protection.\n\n          A federal court should give due consideration, and\n\naccord proper weight, to the judgment of the Advisory Committee\n\nand of state legislatures on this issue when it evaluates whether\n\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fit is appropriate to create a new privilege pursuant to Rule 501.\n\n\n\n     2.      Third Circuit\n\n           Under the analytic framework set forth in this court's\n\nprecedents, creating a parent-child privilege would be ill-\n\nadvised.   In In re Grand Jury Investigation, 918 F.2d 374 (3d\n\nCir. 1990) (Becker, J.), we adopted a clergy-communicant\n\nprivilege.    We did so, however, only after examining the state\n\nand federal precedents addressing the issue of a clergy-\n\ncommunicant privilege and after determining that these\n\nprecedents, on balance, weighed in favor of recognizing such a\n\nprivilege.    Id. at 379-84.   Indeed, we instructed that an\n\nexamination of such precedents was mandatory:\nBoth the history and the language of Rule 501, therefore,\n     provide us with a mandate to develop evidentiary\n     privileges in accordance with common law principles.\n     This mandate, in turn, requires us to examine federal\n     and state case law and impels us to consult treatises\n     and commentaries on the law of evidence that elucidate\n     the development of the common law.\n\n\nId. at 379.\n\n           Moreover, like the Jaffee Court and perhaps in antici-\n\npation of Jaffee's instructions, Judge Becker considered the\n\"reason and experience\" of the state legislatures and of the\n\nAdvisory Committee.    First, Judge Becker, writing for a unanimous\n\npanel, noted that \"virtually every state has recognized some form\n\nof a clergy-communicant privilege.\"      Id. at 381 & n.10 (listing\n\nstate statutes).\n\n\n\n                                    28\n\f          In addition, Judge Becker posited that \"the proposed\n\nrules prove a useful reference point and offer guidance in\n\ndefining the existence and scope of evidentiary privileges in the\n\nfederal courts.\" Id. at 380. Judge Becker further explained:\n\"[I]n many instances, the proposed rules, [used as]\n     [s]tandards, remain a convenient and useful starting\n     point for examining questions of privilege. The\n     [s]tandards are the culmination of three drafts\n     prepared by an Advisory Committee consisting of judges,\n     practicing lawyers and academicians. . . . Finally,\n     they were adopted by the Supreme Court. . . .\n     . . . .\n     . . . [T]he Advisory Committee in drafting the\n     Standards was for the most part restating the law\n     currently applied in the federal courts.\n\n\nId. at 380-81 (quoting J. Weinstein & M. Berger, Weinstein's\n\nEvidence ¶ 501[03] (1987)).   Judge Becker then concluded that\n\n\"[t]he inclusion of the clergy-communicant privilege in the\n\nproposed rules, taken together with its uncontroversial nature,\n\nstrongly suggests that [that] privilege is, in the words of the\n\nSupreme Court, 'indelibly ensconced' in the American common law.\"\n\nId. at 381 (quoting Gillock, 445 U.S. at 368).    Judge Becker\n\nalso provided a detailed exegesis of the historical development\n\nof the clergy-communicant privilege, stressing that common-law\n\ntradition, as reflected in practice and case law, supported\n\nrecognition of such a privilege.\n\n          In contrast, the parent-child privilege sought to be\n\nrecognized here is of relatively recent vintage, see Ismail, 756\nF.2d at 1257-58 (\"The parent-child privilege did not exist at\n\ncommon law\"), and is virtually no more than the product of legal\n\n\n\n                                   29\n\facademicians.   See supra note 12.   Unlike, for example, the\n\nattorney-client privilege, which is \"the oldest\" common-law\n\nprivilege, see United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 562 (1989);\n\nUpjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981), the\n\nparent-child privilege lacks historical antecedents.\n\n          Furthermore, an analysis of the four Wigmore factors,\n\nwhich Judge Becker used to buttress this court's disposition in\n\nIn re Grand Jury Investigation, does not support the creation of\n\na privilege.    Dean Wigmore's four-factor formula requires\n\nsatisfaction of all four factors in order to establish a\n\nprivilege:\n(1) The communications must originate in a confidence that\n     they will not be disclosed.\n(2) This element of confidentiality must be essential to the\n     full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation\n     between the parties.\n(3) The relation must be one which in the opinion of the\n     community ought to be sedulously fostered.\n(4) The injury that would inure to the relation by the\n     disclosure of the communications must be greater than\n     the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of\n     litigation.\n\n\nIn re Grand Jury Investigation, 918 F.2d at 384 (quoting 8 John\n\nH. Wigmore, Evidence § 2285 (J. McNaughton rev. ed. 1961))\n\n(emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).\n\n          At least two of Wigmore's prerequisite conditions for\n\ncreation of a federal common-law privilege are not met under the\n\nfacts of these cases.    We refer to the second and fourth elements\n\nof the Wigmore test.20\n20. The most recent case addressing a parent-child privilege\nanalyzed the privilege under the Wigmore four-factor test, and\n\n\n                                     30\n\f          First, confidentiality--in the form of a testimonial\n\nprivilege--is not essential to a successful parent-child\n\nrelationship, as required by the second factor.   A privilege\n\nshould be recognized only where such a privilege would be\n\nindispensable to the survival of the relationship that society\n\ndeems should be fostered.   For instance, because complete candor\n\nand full disclosure by the client is absolutely necessary in\n\norder for the attorney to function effectively, society recogniz-\n\nes an attorney-client privilege.   Without a guarantee of secrecy,\n\nclients would be unwilling to reveal damaging information.     As a\n\ncorollary, clients would disclose negative information, which an\n\nattorney must know to prove effective representation, only if\n\nthey were assured that such disclosures are privileged.\n\n          In contrast, it is not clear whether children would be\n\nmore likely to discuss private matters with their parents if a\n\nparent-child privilege were recognized than if one were not.    It\n\nis not likely that children, or even their parents, would\n\ntypically be aware of the existence or non-existence of a\n\ntestimonial privilege covering parent-child communications.     On\n\nthe other hand, professionals such as attorneys, doctors and\n\nmembers of the clergy would know of the privilege that attends\n\ntheir respective profession, and their clients, patients or\n\n(..continued)\ndeclined to adopt the privilege after determining that the\nprivilege failed to satisfy two of the four factors - the same\nfactors which are not satisfied here. See In re Inquest\nProceedings, 676 A.2d 790 (Vt. 1996).\n\n\n\n                                   31\n\fparishioners would also be aware that their confidential conver-\n\nsations are protected from compelled disclosure.21\n\n          Moreover, even assuming arguendo that children and\n\ntheir parents generally are aware of whether or not their commu-\n\nnications are protected from disclosure, it is not certain that\n\nthe existence of a privilege enters into whatever thought\n\nprocesses are performed by children in deciding whether or not to\n\nconfide in their parents.   Indeed, the existence or nonexistence\n\nof a parent-child privilege is probably one of the least\n\nimportant considerations in any child's decision as to whether to\n\nreveal some indiscretion, legal or illegal, to a parent.\n\nMoreover, it is unlikely that any parent would choose to deter a\n\nchild from revealing a confidence to the parent solely because a\n\nfederal court has refused to recognize a privilege protecting\n\nsuch communications from disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n21. Notably, the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Evidence\nreached a similar conclusion with respect to a marital\ncommunications privilege. The Advisory Committee explained:\n\n          [Proposed Rule 505] recognizes no privilege for\n     confidential communications [between spouses]. . . .\n     [It cannot] be assumed that marital conduct will be\n     affected by a privilege for confidential communications\n     of whose existence the parties in all likelihood are\n     unaware. The other communication privileges, by way of\n     contrast, have as one party a professional person who\n     can be expected to inform the other of the existence of\n     the privilege.\n\nProposed Fed. R. Evid. 505 advisory committee's note, 56 F.R.D.\nat 245-46.\n\n\n\n                                   32\n\f          Finally, the proposed parent-child privilege fails to\n\nsatisfy the fourth condition of the Wigmore test.    As explained\n\nabove, any injury to the parent-child relationship resulting from\n\nnon-recognition of such a privilege would be relatively\n\ninsignificant.   In contrast, the cost of recognizing such a\n\nprivilege is substantial:    the impairment of the truth-seeking\n\nfunction of the judicial system and the increased likelihood of\n\ninjustice resulting from the concealment of relevant information.\n\nSee United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709 (1974) (stating\n\nthat \"[t]he need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary\n\nsystem is both fundamental and comprehensive\").\n\n          Moreover, because no clear benefit flows from the\n\nrecognition of a parent-child privilege, any injury to the\n\nparent-child relationship caused by compelled testimony as to\n\nconfidential communications is necessarily and substantially out-\n\nweighed by the benefit to society of obtaining all relevant\n\nevidence in a criminal case.    See, e.g., In re Inquest\n\nProceedings, 676 A.2d 790, 793 (Vt. 1996) (finding that although\n\nharm may result from disclosure of a child's confidence, such\n\nharm does not outweigh \"the public interest in seeking the truth\n\nwithin the context of a criminal investigation\"); State v. Maxon,\n756 P.2d 1297, 1301 (Wash. 1988) (stating that the loss of\n\nrelevant evidence outweighs the public policy favoring a\n\nparent-child privilege).    In short, the public good derived from\n\nmaintaining the confidentiality of parent-child communications\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\ftranscends the value of effective and efficient judicial truth-\n\nfinding.\n\n           An even more compelling reason for rejecting a parent-\n\nchild privilege stems from the fact that the parent-child\n\nrelationship differs dramatically from other relationships.         This\n\nis due to the unique duty owing to the child from the parent.        A\n\nparent owes the duty to the child to nurture and guide the child.\n\n This duty is unusual because it inheres in the relationship and\n\nthe relationship arises automatically at the child's birth.\n\n           If, for example, a fifteen year old unemancipated child\n\ninforms her parent that she has committed a crime or has been\n\nusing or distributing narcotics, and this disclosure has been\n\nmade in confidence while the child is seeking guidance, it is\n\nevident to us that, regardless of whether the child consents or\n\nnot, the parent must have the right to take such action as the\n\nparent deems appropriate in the interest of the child.       That\n\naction could be commitment to a drug rehabilitation center or a\n\nreport of the crime to the juvenile authorities.    This is so\n\nbecause, in theory at least, juvenile proceedings are undertaken\n\nsolely in the interest of the child.    We would regard it\n\nintolerable in such a situation if the law intruded in the guise\n\nof a privilege, and silenced the parent because the child had a\n\nprivilege to prevent disclosure.\n\n           This results in the analysis that any privilege, if\n\nrecognized, must be dependent upon both the parent and child\n\n\n\n                                   34\n\fasserting it.   However, in such a case, the privilege would\n\ndisappear if the parent can waive it.   It follows therefore that,\n\nif a child is able to communicate openly with a parent and seeks\n\nguidance from that parent, the entire basis for the privilege is\n\ndestroyed if the child is required to recognize that confidence\n\nwill be maintained only so long as the parent wants the\n\nconversation to be confidential.   If, however, the parent can\n\nwaive the privilege unilaterally, the goal of the privilege is\n\ndestroyed.   When the Supreme Court authorized a psychotherapist-\n\npatient privilege in Jaffee, it told us as much in stating,\n\n\n     We part company with the Court of Appeals on a\n          separate point. We reject the balancing\n          component of the privilege implemented by\n          that court and a small number of States.\n          Making the promise of confidentiality\n          contingent upon a trial judge's later\n          evaluation of the relative importance of the\n          patient's interest in privacy and evidentiary\n          need for disclosure would eviscerate the\n          effectiveness of the privilege. As we\n          explained in Upjohn, if the purpose of the\n          privilege is to be served, the participants\n          in the confidential conversation 'must be\n          able to predict with some degree of certainty\n          whether particular discussions will be\n          protected. An uncertain privilege, or one\n          which purports to be certain but results in\n          widely varying applications by the courts, is\n          little better than no privilege at all.'\n\n\n\nJaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1932 (1996) (quoting Upjohn\nCo. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 393 (1981)).\n\n          It follows then that an effective parent-child\n\nprivilege requires that the parent's lips be sealed but such a\n\n\n                                   35\n\fsealing would be inexcusable in the parent-child relationship.\n\nNo government should have that power.\n\n          Indeed the obligation on the parent to act goes far\n\nbeyond the parent's obligation to raise and nurture the child.\n\nThus a parent-child privilege implicates considerations which are\n\nvastly different from the traditional privileges to which resort\n\nis had as analogues.\n\n          In sum, neither historical tradition, nor common-law\n\nprinciples, nor Wigmore formulations, nor the logic of\n\nprivileges, nor the \"reason and experience\" of the various states\n\nsupports creation of a parent-child privilege.\n\nD.   RECOGNITION OF A PARENT-CHILD PRIVILEGE SHOULD BE LEFT TO\n     CONGRESS.\n\n\n          Although we, and our sister courts, obviously have\n\nauthority to develop and modify the common law of privileges, we\n\nshould be circumspect about creating new privileges based upon\n\nperceived public policy considerations.   This is particularly so\n\nwhere there exist policy concerns which the legislative branch is\n\nbetter equipped to evaluate.   To paraphrase Justice Scalia,\n\nwriting in dissent in Jaffee, and referring to the psycho-\n\ntherapist privilege:\nThe question before us today is not whether there should be an\n          evidentiary privilege for [parent-child\n          communications]. Perhaps there should. But the\n          question before us is whether (1) the need for that\n          privilege is so clear, and (2) the desirable contours\n          of that privilege are so evident, that it is\n          appropriate for this [c]ourt to craft it in common law\n          fashion, under Rule 501.\n\n\n                                   36\n\fJaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1940 (1996) (Scalia, J.\n\ndissenting).\n\n          The legislature, not the judiciary, is institutionally\n\nbetter equipped to perform the balancing of the competing policy\n\nissues required in deciding whether the recognition of a parent-\n\nchild privilege is in the best interests of society.     Congress,\n\nthrough its legislative mechanisms, is also better suited for the\n\ntask of defining the scope of any prospective privilege.22\n\n     Congress, is able to consider, for example, society's moral,\n\nsociological, economic, religious and other values without being\n\nconfined to the evidentiary record in any particular case.    Thus,\n\nin determining whether a parent-child privilege should obtain,\n\nCongress can take into consideration a host of facts and factors\n\nwhich the judiciary may be unable to consider.   These\n\nconsiderations are also relevant to determining whether the\n\nprivilege, if it is to be recognized, should extend to adult\n\nchildren, adopted children or unemancipated minors.23\n\n22. In a state context, in In re: A & M, 403 N.Y.S. 2d 381 (App.\nDiv. 1978), the New York Appellate Division expressly declined to\nadopt a common-law privilege, explaining: \"[A]lthough there are\npersuasive arguments to apply a privilege in these circumstances,\nwe believe that the creation of a privilege devolves exclusively\non the Legislature.\" Id. (footnotes omitted).\n    We recognize, of course, that the Advisory Committee Notes to\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence provide that privileges shall\ncontinue to be developed by the courts of the United States. See\nFed. R. Evid. 501 advisory committee's notes.\n\n23. Should the privilege be restricted to unemancipated minors\nor should it extend to all children, regardless of age,\nunemancipated and emancipated? No apposite case, state or\nfederal, provides a parent-child privilege for adults or\nemancipated children. See, e.g., In re Erato, 2 F.3d 11 (2d Cir.\n\n\n                                  37\n\f            Among additional factors that Congress could consider\n\nare other parameters of familial relationships.      Does \"parent\"\n\ninclude step-parent or grand-parent?      Does \"child\" include an\n\nadopted child, or a step-child?    Should the privilege extend to\n\nsiblings?   Furthermore, if another family member is present at\n\nthe time of the relevant communication, is the privilege\n\nautomatically barred or destroyed?     See, e.g., In re Grand Jury\n\nSubpoena (Matthews), 714 F.2d at 224-25 (in-laws); United States\n\nv. (Under Seal), 714 F.2d at 349 n.4 (brother and cousin).\n(..continued)\n1993); State v. Willoughby, 532 A.2d 1020 (Me. 1987); In re Gail\nD., 525 A.2d 337 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1987); State v.\nMaxon, 756 P.2d 1297 (Wash. 1988). Nor do any state statutes\nprovide a privilege for emancipated children. Indeed, both Idaho\nand Minnesota, by statute, limit their variants of the parent-\nchild privilege to children under age 18. See Idaho Code §§ 9-\n203(7), 32-101 (1990 & Supp. 1995); Minn. Stat. §§ 595.02(1)(j),\n645.451 (1988 & Supp. 1996).\n           In the present case, of course, the daughter in the\nDelaware appeals is 16 years old and unemancipated. Hence, the\nissue of extending the privilege to an adult or an emancipated\nchild is not relevant insofar as the Delaware target is\nconcerned. However, the appellant-son in the Virgin Islands\ncase, who was 18 years old at the time of the relevant\ncommunication, and, therefore, no longer a minor nor\nunemancipated, urges that the privilege be unrestricted with\nregard to age. Under Virgin Islands law, the son would be deemed\nemancipated. See V.I. Code Ann. tit. 16, § 261 (providing that\nthe age of majority in the Virgin Islands is 18 years old); V.I.\nCode Ann. tit. 16, § 221(4) (minor becomes \"emancipat[ed]\" by\nreason of having attained the age of majority\"); see also In Re\nGuardianship of Penn, 15 F.3d 292, 295 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting\nthat Virgin Islands legislature, in 1972, lowered the age of\nmajority from 21 to 18); Galvan v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.,\n549 F.2d 281, 288 (3d Cir. 1977)(same).\n           Similarly, federal law would indicate that an\nindividual attains adulthood at the age of 18 years. See 18\nU.S.C. § 2255 (1984) (defining \"minor\" as \"any person under the\nage of 18 years\"); 18 U.S.C. § 5031 (Supp. 1996) (defining\n\"juvenile\" as a person who has not attained his eighteenth\nbirthday).\n\n\n\n                                     38\n\f            Hence, as a court without the ability to consider\n\nmatters beyond the evidentiary record presented, we should be\n\nchary about creating new privileges and ordinarily should defer\n\nto the legislature to do so.   See, e.g., Branzburg v. Hayes, 408\n\nU.S. 665, 706 (1972) (plurality) (suggesting that courts should\n\nyield to legislatures in creating and defining privileges);\n\nPeople v. Dixon, 411 N.W.2d 760, 763 (Mich. Ct. App. 1987)\n\n(stating that creation of parent-child testimonial privilege is\n\nbest left to legislature); In re Parkway Manor Healthcare Ctr.,\n\n448 N.W.2d 116, 121 (Minn. Ct. App. 1989) (deferring to\n\nlegislature to create a privilege for self-evaluation data); Cook\n\nv. King County, 510 P.2d 659, 661 (Wash. Ct. App. 1973)\n\n(\"Although 'privilege' is a common-law concept, the granting of a\n\ntestimonial privilege is a recognized function of legislative\n\npower.\").    Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained that one basis\n\nfor its disinclination to recognize new privileges is deference\n\nto the legislature:\n     We are especially reluctant to recognize a privilege in an\n     area where it appears that Congress has considered the\n     relevant competing concerns but has not provided the\n     privilege itself.\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493 U.S. at 189.\n            Congress too has recognized the importance of privilege\n\nrules insofar as the truth-seeking process is concerned.   Con-\n\ngress specifically addressed that subject when it delegated rule-\n\nmaking authority to the Supreme Court as to rules of procedure\n\nand evidence.   It did so by identifying and designating the law\n\n\n                                    39\n\fof privileges as a special area meriting greater legislative\n\noversight.    Congress expressly provided that \"[a]ny . . . rule\n\ncreating, abolishing, or modifying an evidentiary privilege shall\n\nhave no force or effect unless approved by Act of Congress.\"       28\n\nU.S.C. § 2074(b) (1994).     In contrast, all other evidentiary\n\nrules promulgated by the Supreme Court and transmitted to\n\nCongress automatically take effect unless Congress enacts a\n\nstatute to the contrary.    See 28 U.S.C. § 2074(a) (1994).24\n\n\n                                 IV.\n\n             A few further observations about the dissent and why it\n\ndoes not persuade us that the parent-child privilege outweighs\n\nthe government's interest in disclosure:\n\n             First, in her dissenting and concurring opinion, Judge\n\nMansmann attempts to distinguish the Virgin Islands appeal (where\n\na father has been subpoenaed to testify about communications made\n\nto him by his son who is over the age of eighteen25), from the\n\n24. The preferred method by which any Rule of Evidence would be\nproposed and ultimately promulgated would be by proceeding:\nfirst, through the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, then\nto the Judicial Conference Standing Committee on Practice and\nProcedure (with public notice and comment at both these stages),\nthen to the Judicial Conference of the United States, and then,\nof course, to the Supreme Court, which, if the proposed Rule was\napproved, would then transmit the proposed Rule to Congress for\nits consideration. See 28 U.S.C. § 2072, et seq.; 18 U.S.C. §§\n3402, 3771, 3772.\n\n25. Because the son is over eighteen years of age, under Judge\nMansmann's formulation of the privilege, we assume there would\nhave to be a hearing by the district court to assess various\nfactors to determine whether a privilege would lie (since Judge\nMansmann declines to adopt a bright-line rule with regard to\n\n\n                                       40\n\fDelaware appeal (where a teenage daughter has been subpoenaed to\n\ngive testimony against her father).     The record of the Delaware\n\nappeal, however, does not inform us as to the nature of the\n\ntestimony being sought or the nature of the daughter's knowledge.\n\n Does it arise from observations, overheard statements,\n\ncommunications with her father, or some other source?    If indeed\n\nit arises from confidential communications, does the privilege\n\nadvocated by Judge Mansmann in the Virgin Islands case then\n\napply?   If so, is the alleged distinction a valid one, or do both\n\nappeals suffer from the same deficiencies we have identified with\n\nrespect to any parent-child privilege?\n\n          Secondly, we note that the Virgin Islands privilege\n\nwhich Judge Mansmann would recognize, while characterized as a\n\nlimited one, would only come into play where a child has made a\n\nconfidential communication to a parent in the course of seeking\n\nparental advice.   See Dissenting Opinion at 7.26   Both of these\n\n(..continued)\nage). These \"factors\" would include such variables as age,\nmaturity, the child's residence and the precise nature of the\ncommunication. See Dissenting Opinion at 7.\n          We have already discussed the limitation of such a\nprivilege to minors, (see note 23 supra) and know of no case\nwhere an adult child and his or her parent have been able to\ninvoke the privilege.\n\n26. We note that, although Judge Mansmann urges that we\nrecognize a privilege in the Virgin Islands case, the record in\nthe Virgin Islands case does not disclose the content of the\ncommunication at issue, and reveals no evidence that the son\nsought advice from his father -- even if one may infer that the\nson's communication was otherwise confidential in nature.\nTherefore, although the dissent advocates applying the privilege\nin the Virgin Islands case, Judge Mansmann fails to identify and\nthus satisfy her threshold qualification of the child seeking\n\n\n                                   41\n\fqualifications -- (1) a confidential communication, spoken or\n\nwritten, and (2) arising in the course of seeking parental\n\nadvice27 -- would have to be determined by a hearing - a mini-\n\ntrial - which would have the effect of destroying the\n\nconfidential nature of the communication (since the communication\n\nwould have to be divulged so that the district court could\n\ndetermine its precise nature).   It would also endow the district\n\ncourt with virtually unlimited discretion in granting or denying\n\nthe privilege (since the dissent provides little guidance to the\n\ndistrict court for making such a determination).   The exercise of\n\nthis discretion would undermine the very essence of a privilege\n\nthat \"the participants in the confidential conversation\" can\n\npredict \"with some degree of certainty\" that their conversation\n\nwill be protected.   See Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1932\n\n(1996).\n\n          Thirdly, the crafting of the privilege as a jointly-\n\nheld privilege (by both parent and child) undermines the\n\ndissent's goal of encouraging a child to seek the advice of a\n\nparent and protecting the parent-child relationship.    The entire\n\nthrust of the dissent's opinion is that a child should feel\n\nconfident, in communicating with a parent to seek advice and\n(..continued)\nadvice from a parent -- a requirement that she identifies as\nessential for such a privilege.\n\n27. As the dissent frames the privilege, if a child divulges to\nhis parent that he is the Unabomber, a sex offender or an abuser\nof drugs, and does so without seeking guidance or advice, the\nprivilege would be unavailable.\n\n\n\n                                   42\n\fguidance, that the communication will remain inviolate.      However,\n\nthe dissent, then straddling the fence, also argues that the\n\nparent can choose to violate such a confidence and report a\n\nconfidential communication to others (presumably the authorities)\n\nin the interest of parental judgment.     See Dissenting Opinion at\n\n8 n.6.   We know of no privilege that can operate in such a two-\n\nway fashion and still remain effective.\n\n           The few observations made above do no more than\n\nhighlight the stark difference between the dissent's view of the\n\npublic good which subordinates the government's interest in\n\ndisclosure to a parent-child privilege, and the position we have\n\ntaken which recognizes justice and disclosure as the predominant\n\nprinciples for ascertaining truth.    See Trammel v. United States,\n\n445 U.S. 40, 47 (1980).\n\n           Finally, we observe that implicit in the various\n\ndiscussions by courts (both federal and state) of the parent-\n\nchild privilege is the fact that the \"strong and trusting parent-\n\nchild relationships\" which the dissent would preserve, see\n\nDissenting Opinion at 2, have existed throughout the years\n\nwithout the concomitant existence of a privilege protecting that\n\nrelationship.\n\n\n\n\n                                     43\n\f                                 V.\n\n          In short, if a new privilege is deemed worthy of\n\nrecognition, the wiser course in our opinion is to leave the\n\nadoption of such a privilege to Congress.\n\n\n          Although we are not reluctant to chart a new legal\n\ncourse, such an action should not be premised upon unsound legal\n\nprinciples or emotion.   The instant appeals furnish us with\n\nneither reason, nor analysis, nor a basis upon which to fashion\n\nsuch a privilege.\n\n          All that we have been told by the appellants and by the\n\ndissent is:   we should look to the healthy, psychological\n\ndevelopment of children; and that compelling the testimony of a\n\nparent is repugnant and indecent; that it is more important that\n\na child communicate with a parent than it is to compel a parent's\n\ntestimony; and that the preservation of the family and the\n\nprotection of a strong and trusting parent-child relationship\n\ntrumps all other interests.    These conclusions, as well as the\n\ncriteria which the dissent would require as to the nature of the\n\ncommunications and whether they were imparted in an effort to\n\nseek advice and counseling, cannot be satisfied without the\n\nbenefit of evidence, expert testimony, hearings or recognized\n\nauthority.    If a new privilege were to be engraved in the\n\nconcrete of our jurisprudence as the dissent argues, then it\n\nshould be framed so that its contours are clear and unambiguous,\n\nand it should be capable of being applied precisely, without the\n\n\n\n                                      44\n\fneed for multiple pretrial hearings, in addition to the\n\nprivilege's existence being known to the participants.    Sympathy\n\nalone cannot justify the creation of a new and unprecedented\n\nprivilege which does not meet the standards set by Congress, the\n\nSupreme Court and this court.\n\n          Accordingly, we will affirm the district court's order\n\nof June 19, 1995, which denied the father's motion to quash the\n\ngrand jury subpoena in the Virgin Islands case (95-7354).   We\n\nwill also affirm the district court's order of September 10, 1996\n\nin the Delaware cases (96-7529 and 96-7530), denying the joint\n\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena and rejecting appellants'\n\nclaims concerning the Schofield affidavit and in camera review.\n\n\n\nIN RE GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS (IMPOUNDED), No. 95-7354\n\nIn Re Grand Jury -- John Doe I, John Doe, II, Nos. 96-7530 and\n\n96-7259\n\n\n\nMANSMANN, J., concurring and dissenting.\n\n     I write separately because I am convinced that the\n\ntestimonial privilege issue raised by the Virgin Islands appeal\n\nis substantially different from that presented in the Delaware\n\nappeals28 and should be resolved in favor of the targeted son.\n28.       In the Virgin Islands appeal, a father has been\nsubpoenaed to testify regarding communications made to him by his\nteenaged son. In the Delaware appeals, on the other hand, a\nteenaged daughter has been subpoenaed to give testimony, based on\nher own knowledge, which could implicate her father in a crime;\nconfidential communications between parent and child are not\n\n\n                                  45\n\fThe Virgin Islands appeal, which challenges the denial of a\n\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena, requires that we confront\n\nan issue of first impression in our circuit:   should we make\n\navailable to a parent and child an evidentiary privilege which\n\ncould be invoked to prevent compelling that parent to testify\n\nregarding confidential communications made to the parent by his\n\nchild in the course of seeking parental advice and guidance?29\n\nIt appears that this precise question is one of first impression\n\nin the federal courts.\n\n     Because I conclude that the public good at issue, the\n\nprotection of strong and trusting parent-child relationships,\n\noutweighs the government's interest in disclosure, I would\n\nexercise the authority granted to the federal courts by Congress\n\nunder Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and would\n\nrecognize a limited privilege.   Accordingly, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n\n\n(..continued)\nalleged in the Delaware appeals. As I will explain, the\nprivilege question to be resolved in the Virgin Islands appeal\nfocuses on the confidential communication made by a child in the\ncourse of seeking parental advice. Consequently, it is more\nnarrow and more compelling than that presented in the Delaware\nappeals.\n\n29.       The majority contends that the record in the Virgin\nIslands matter \"reveals no evidence that the son sought advice\nfrom his father.\" (Typescript at 40 n.25.) This is incorrect.\nIn the Motion to Quash filed by the son, the son refers to the\nfact that he \"spoke privately with his father, seeking his\nfather's counsel about the matters which are the subject of the\nGrand Jury's investigation.\"\n\n\n\n                                   46\n\f                                   I.\n\n      This case, unlike most which we consider, does not require\n\nthat we apply the law as it exists with respect to testimonial\n\nprivilege.    Instead, we are asked to determine what the law in\n\nthis area ought to be.      While most courts have declined to\n\nrecognize a parent-child testimonial privilege, they have done so\n\nin contexts far different from the one presented here.     I am\n\nconvinced that this is an appropriate case in which to recognize\n\nand set parameters for a limited privilege.      Doing so is critical\n\nto several important public policy interests such as the\n\n\"protection of strong and trusting parent-child relationships and\n\nthe preservation of the sanctity of the family. . . .\"\n\nAppellant's Brief at 8.     The recognition of a parent-child\n\nprivilege is essential to \"the healthy psychological development\n\nof children and to the development of society as a whole\";\n\ncompelling a parent to testify adversely to a child is\n\n\"`repugnant to social sensibilities' and contrary to a democratic\n\nview of decency.\"    Wendy Meredith Watts, The Parent-Child\n\nPrivilege:    Hardly a New or Revolutionary Concept, 28 Wm. & Mary\n\nL. Rev. 583, 611-13 (1987).\n\n      These and other related public policy arguments have been\n\nadvanced in a spate of articles by academicians and other legal\n\ncommentators who, virtually uniformly, favor incorporating a\n\nparent-child testimonial privilege into the fabric of the law.30\n30.          See Maj. Op.   (Typescript at 13 n.11).\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\f The courts, however, federal and state, have been reluctant to\n\nmake these policy arguments the foundation for a \"new\" privilege.\n\n In the circumstances presented here, I do not share that\n\nreluctance and am convinced that where compelled testimony by a\n\nparent concerns confidential statements made to the parent by his\n\nchild in the course of seeking parental advice and guidance, it\n\nis time to chart a new legal course.\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n                                 A.\n\n      Any inquiry concerning the federal court's extension of\n\ntestimonial privilege necessarily begins with Rule 501 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence.31   Under this Rule, as interpreted by\n\nthe Supreme Court in United States v. Trammel, 445 U.S. 40, 47\n\n(1980), the federal courts are authorized to \"develop[] . . .\n\ntestimonial privileges in federal criminal trials governed by the\n\n\n31.

However, in civil actions and proceedings,\n     with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to\n     which state law supplies the rule of decision, the\n     privilege of witness, person, government, state or\n     political subdivision thereof shall be determined in\n     accordance with state law.\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\fprinciples of the common law as they may be interpreted . . . in\n\nthe light of reason and experience.\"    In enacting Rule 501,\n\nCongress specifically declined to restrict development in the law\n\nof privilege to the legislative realm and declined to limit the\n\nrange of possible privileges.   Congress instead crafted Rule 501\n\nin order to \"provide the courts with the flexibility to develop\n\nrules of privilege on a case-by-case basis.\"    It was Congress'\n\nintent \"to leave the door open to change.\"     Id.\n\n     The courts' role in fostering evolution in the area of\n\ntestimonial privilege was reinforced recently by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Jaffee v. Redmond, 1996 WL 315841 at *4 (U.S.) (footnote\n\nomitted):\nThe Senate Report accompanying the 1974 adoption of the\n     [Federal Rules of Evidence] indicates that Rule 501\n     \"should be understood as reflecting the view that the\n     recognition of a privilege based on a confidential\n     relationship should be determined on a case-by-case\n     basis.\" S. Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 13 (1974). The Rule\n     thus did not freeze the law governing the privileges of\n     witnesses in federal trials at a particular point in\n     our history, but rather directed federal courts to\n     \"continue the evolutionary development of testimonial\n     privileges.\" Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 47\n     (1980); see also University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC,\n     493 U.S. 182, 189 (1990).\n\n\nAccording to the Court, \"the common-law principles underlying the\n\nrecognition of testimonial privileges can be stated simply.\"       Id.\n Evidentiary privileges are \"exceptions to the demand for every\n\nman's evidence\" and should \"not be lightly created nor\n\nexpansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search\n\nfor the truth.\"   United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709-10\n\n\n\n                                   49\n\f(1974).   Despite the strictures of this general rule, the federal\n\ncourts may be justified in recognizing a testimonial privilege\n\nwhere that privilege \"promotes sufficiently important interests\n\nto outweigh the need for probative evidence.\"   University of\n\nPennsylvania v. EEOC, 493 U.S. 182, 189 (1990) (quoting Trammel,\n\n445 U.S. at 51).    This is especially appropriate where, as here,\n\nthere is no indication that Congress, in enacting Rule 501 -- or\n\nin any other context -- has evaluated the competing concerns\n\nassociated with a particular privilege and has rejected that\n\nprivilege.    See University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493 U.S. 182,\n\n189 (1990).    It is abundantly clear that under Rule 501 and the\n\ninterpretive caselaw federal courts have authority in appropriate\n\ncircumstances to modify the availability and scope of testimonial\n\nprivileges and to recognize new common law privileges.\n\n\n\n\n                                    50\n\f                                 B.\n\n     When a federal court considers extending the scope of a\n\ntestimonial privilege or recognizing a new privilege, Rule 501\n\nrequires that the court engage in a balancing process, weighing\n\nthe need for confidentiality in a particular communication\n\nagainst the need for relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding.\n\n Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50.   I am convinced that the public good\n\nderived from a child's ability to communicate openly with and to\n\nseek guidance from his or her parents is of sufficient magnitude\n\nto transcend the judicial system's interest in compelled parental\n\ntestimony.32   Recognizing that \"our authority is narrow in scope\n\n32.       In addition to the balancing test laid out in Trammel,\nDean Wigmore has suggested a four-part test for determining\nwhether or not a particular testimonial privilege should be\nrecognized. In order for a privilege to obtain: (1) the\ncommunications must originate in a confidence that they will not\nbe disclosed; (2) this element of confidentiality must be\nessential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the\nrelation between the parties; (3) the relation must be one which,\nin the opinion of society, ought to be sedulously fostered; and\n(4) the injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure\nof the communication must be greater than the benefit thereby\ngained for the correct disposal of litigation. 8 John Henry\nWigmore, Evidence § 2285 (J. McNaughton rev. ed. 1961); see also\nIn re Grand Jury Investigation, 918 F.2d 374, 383-84 (3d Cir.\n1990) (weighing Dean Wigmore's four prerequisites). I part\ncompany with the majority in the application of this test and am\nconvinced that the factors analyzed under the Rule 501 balancing\ntest are sufficient to satisfy the Wigmore test as well. The\nfirst condition of the Wigmore test is satisfied in that the\nparent-child relationship is one which naturally gives rise to\nconfidential communication. Second, confidentiality underlies\nthe parent child relationship; mutual trust encourages children\nto consult parents for guidance with the expectation that the\nparent will, in appropriate circumstances, honor the\nconfidentiality of those statements. Third, the family unit is\nthe building block of our society and the parent-child\nrelationship is at the core of that family unit. Finally,\nalthough the majority disputes this point, I am convinced that\n\n\n                                      51\n\fand [to] be exercised only after careful consideration in the\n\nface of a strong showing of need for the privilege,\" In re Grand\n\nJury Proceedings, 918 F.2d 374, 383 (3d Cir. 1990), I stress that\n\nthe privilege which I would recognize is a limited one, applying\n\nonly to compelled testimony concerning confidential\n\ncommunications made to a parent by his child in the course of\n\nseeking parental advice.   Although this case might have been more\n\ncompelling had the son been a minor at the time of his statements\n\nto his father, I would not adopt a bright-line rule applicable\n\nonly to those who have not reached legal majority.    In order to\n\nadvance the policy interests which the targeted son articulated,\n\nI would prefer to leave the particular factors to be considered\n\nin determining application of the privilege to development on a\n\ncase-by-case basis.   I expect that these factors would include\n\nsuch variables as age, maturity, whether or not the child resides\n\nwith the parents, and the precise nature of the communications\n\nfor which the privilege is claimed.     The privilege would apply to\n\nsituations in which it is invoked by both parent and child; this\n\ncase does not require that we confront applicability of the\n\nprivilege where it is invoked by the parent or the child alone.\n\n     The goal in recognizing this limited privilege would not be\n\nto guarantee confidentiality per se but to shield parent-child\n\nrelationships from the devastating effects likely to be\n(..continued)\nthe damage resulting from compelling a parent to testify against\nhis child, in most if not all cases, outweighs the benefit\nassociated with correct disposal of the litigation.\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\fassociated with compelled testimony.    As one commentator has\n\nwritten:\n[T]o conceive of . . . privileges merely as exclusionary\n     rules, is to start out on the wrong road and, except by\n     happy accident, to reach the wrong destination. They\n     are, or rather by chance of litigation may become,\n     exclusionary rules; but this is incidental and\n     secondary. Primarily they are a right to be let alone,\n     a right to unfettered freedom, in certain narrowly\n     prescribed relationships, from the state's coercive or\n     supervisory powers. . . .\n\n\nLouisell, Confidentiality, Conformity, and Confusions:\n\nPrivileges in Federal Court Today, 31 Tul. L. Rev. 101, 110-11\n\n(1956).   An effective parent-child relationship is one deserving\n\nof protection.   It rests upon a relationship of mutual trust\n\nwhere the child has the right to expect that the parent will act\n\nin accordance with the child's best interest.33   If the state is\n\npermitted to interfere in that relationship by compelling parents\n\nto divulge information conveyed to them in confidence by their\n\nchildren, mutual trust, and ultimately the family, are\n\nthreatened.\n\n33.       While it is true, as the majority says, that few\nchildren are likely to be aware of a privilege per se, there is,\nin any event, a certain expectation that this information will\nnot be disclosed.\n\n          As the majority points out, there may be circumstances\nin which a parent, having heard communications from a child,\ndecides that it is in the child's best interest that those\ncommunications be divulged. The privilege which I advocate would\nnot interfere with that parental judgment. Presumably, if the\nparent is indeed acting in the child's best interest, disclosure\nwill not ultimately threaten the family relationship which I seek\nto protect. Furthermore, if the parent is willing to disclose\ninformation which may harm the child, the relationship is already\nbeyond the need for protection.\n\n\n\n                                   53\n\f     While I am aware that the availability of even this limited\n\nparent-child privilege may, in some rare circumstances,\n\ncomplicate a criminal fact-finding proceeding, I am convinced\n\nthat the risk is one well worth bearing.    \"[T]o reach the truth\n\nat the cost of the parent-child relationship would be to win the\n\nbattle and lose the war.\"   Wendy Meredith Watts, The Parent-Child\n\nPrivileges:    Hardly a New or Revolutionary Concept, 28 Wm. & Mary\n\nL. Rev. 583, 609 (1987).    This is especially true where, as here\n\nin the Virgin Islands case, the parent is not a co-defendant or a\n\nco-witness to a criminal act, and is not alleged to be hiding the\n\ninstrumentality or the fruits of a criminal act.\n\n     I cannot agree with the majority that testimonial privileges\n\nmust be regarded as automatic impediments to the effectiveness of\n\nthe judicial system.   In limited circumstances these privileges\n\nare critical to important policy interests.    I am convinced, as\n\nwas the district court, that \"youngsters today are increasingly\n\nfaced with excruciatingly dangerous and difficult situations\" and\n\nthat \"the law ought to do everything possible to encourage\n\nchildren to confide in their parents and turn to [them] in times\n\nof trouble.\"    In re Grand Jury Proceeding, Misc. No. 95-009, at\n\n9, 10 (D.V.I. June 19, 1995).\n\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n     The spousal privilege is the only testimonial privilege\n\nbased on a familial relationship to have received general\n\n\n\n                                      54\n\facceptance in the federal courts.34     See In re Erato, 2 F.3d 11,\n\n16 (2d Cir. 1993).   In arguing that we should uphold the father's\n\nclaim of privilege in this case, I am motivated by many of the\n\nsame concerns which underlie the spousal privilege.35    The policy\n\nadvanced by the spousal privilege \"is the protection of the\n\nmarital confidences, regarded as so essential to the preservation\n\nof the marriage relationship as to outweigh the disadvantages to\n\nthe administration of justice which the privilege entails.\"\n\nWolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7, 14 (1934).     Similar concerns\n\nare present here:\n\n34.       Four relationship-based privileges have received\nfederal court recognition: those between penitent and priest,\nattorney and client, physician and patient, and, most recently,\nthe privilege between therapist and patient. See Trammel v.\nUnited States, 445 U.S. 40, 51 (1980), and Jaffee v. Redmond,\n1996 WL 315841 (U.S.).\n\n35.       Some commentators have sought to analogize the parent-\nchild privilege to the more widely recognized professional\ntestimonial privileges such as that between attorney and client,\npriest and penitent, and physician and patient:\n\nThe parent-child relationship is analogous to the privileged\n     professional relationships in many respects. As the\n     professional exercises his skill in the delicate\n     relationship with his client, the parent plays a unique\n     and sensitive role in the life of his \"client,\" the\n     child. In fulfilling this role, the parent must assume\n     many of the same responsibilities as professionals.\n     The parent, for example, often must serve as the\n     child's legal advisor, spiritual counselor, and\n     physical and emotional health expert. The necessity\n     for confidentiality is comparable to that within the\n     professional relationships. Like the attorney, priest,\n     or psychiatrist, parents must establish an atmosphere\n     of trust to facilitate free and open communication.\n\nGregory W. Franklin, Note, The Judicial Development of the\nParent-Child Testimonial Privilege: Too Big for its Britches?\n26 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 145, 151 (1984).\n\n\n                                   55\n\fIdeally, the child-parent relationship encompasses aspects\n     of the marital relationship -- mutual love, affection,\n     and intimacy . . . the parent providing emotional\n     guidance and the child relying on him for help and\n     support. . . . As in the marital . . . relation[ship],\n     this optimal child-parent relationship cannot exist\n     without a great deal of communication between the two.\n     . . . Manifestly, the parent's disclosure of such\n     information to a third party, . . . would deter\n     continued communication between child and parent.\n\n\nComment, The Child-Parent Privilege:    A Proposal, 47 Fordham L.\n\nRev. 771, 781 (1979).   The reasoning of the district court in In\n\nRe Agosto, 553 F. Supp. 1298, 1325 (D. Nev. 1983), is also\n\ninstructive:\nThere is no reasonable basis for extending a testimonial\n     privilege for confidential communications to spouses,\n     who enjoy a dissoluble legal contract, yet denying a\n     parent . . . the right to claim such a privilege to\n     protect communications made within an indissoluble\n     family unit, bonded by blood, affection, loyalty, and\n     tradition. And further, if the rationale behind the\n     privilege of a witness-spouse to refuse to testify\n     adversely against his or her spouse in a criminal\n     proceeding serves to prevent the invasion of the\n     harmony and privacy of the marriage relationship\n     itself, then affording the same protection to the\n     parent-child relationship is even more compelling.\n\n\n     The Court in Trammel also recognized that privileges\n\n\"affecting marriage, home and family relationships,\" 445 U.S. at\n\n48, are especially worthy of consideration.36   Within the family\n36.       While the majority opinion distinguishes the privilege\nwhich I would recognize from those involving professional\nrelationships, it does not address the parallels which exist\nbetween a parent-child privilege and the spousal privilege. In\nTrammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), the Supreme Court\nheld that in federal courts, the spousal privilege belongs solely\nto the spouse who is a witness. \"The court concluded that the\njustification for the privilege -- prevention of marital discord\n-- was not served by allowing the defendant spouse to prevent the\nvoluntary testimony of the witness spouse . . . . The court\nnoted that state law was moving toward granting the privilege\n\n\n                                   56\n\fstructure but beyond the marital partners, I can think of no\n\nrelationship more fundamental than that between parent and child.\n\n Society has an interest in protecting the family structure; the\n\nparent-child relationship is amenable to identification and\n\nsegregation for special treatment.\n\n\n\n                                 D.\n\n     The parent-child privilege is not a novel or radical\n\nconcept.    \"Both ancient Jewish law and Roman law entirely barred\n\nfamily members from testifying against one another based on a\n\ndesire to promote the solidarity and trust that support the\n\nfamily unit.   The Napoleonic Code also prevented the disclosure\n\nof confidences between family members.\"    J.

Rev. 1450, 1568 (1985).\nThe goal of protecting family relationships is paramount in the\ncase now before us; the privilege which I would recognize is\nbased on concerns broader than the guarantee of confidentiality.\n As the caselaw with respect to spousal privilege establishes, a\nprivilege may indeed advance these broader familial interests\nwithout requiring that the child be allowed to silence a parent\nwho is willing to testify.\n\n\n\n                                      57\n\f     Three states (Idaho, Massachusetts and Minnesota) have\n\nadopted some variant of the parent-child privilege by statute,37\n\nand one state, New York, has judicially recognized the privilege.\n\n In re A&M, 403 N.Y.S.2d 375, 61 A.2d 426 (1978).38   Furthermore,\n\n\n37.       The Idaho statute limits the privilege to\ncommunications by minors to their parents. It provides in\nrelevant part:\n\nAny parent, guardian or legal custodian shall not be forced\n     to disclose any communication made by their minor child\n     or ward to them concerning matters in any civil or\n     criminal action to which such child or ward is a party.\n      Such matters so communicated shall be privileged and\n     protected against disclosure . . . .\n\nIdaho Code § 9-203(7) (1990 & Supp. 1995).\n\n          In Massachusetts, a minor child is deemed incompetent\nto testify against her parent in a criminal proceeding:\n\nAn unemancipated, minor child, living with a parent, shall\n     not testify before a grand jury, trial of an\n     indictment, complaint or other criminal proceeding,\n     against said parent, where the victim in such\n     proceeding is not a member of said parent's family and\n     who does not reside in the said parent's household.\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 233, § 20 (1986 & Supp. 1996).\n\n          Minnesota also recognizes a limited parent-child\n(minor) privilege:\n\nA parent or the parent's minor child may not be examined as\n     to any communication made in confidence by the minor to\n     the minor's parent. A communication is confidential if\n     made out of the presence of persons not members of the\n     child's immediate family living in the same household.\n\nMinn. Stat. § 595.02(1)(i) (1988 & Supp. 1996).\n\n38.       The decision in this case rested on constitutional\ngrounds. See also People v. Fitzgerald, 422 N.Y.S.2d 309, 314\n(Westchester County Ct. 1979) (parent-child privilege flows from\nU.S. and New York State Constitutions).\n\n\n\n                                  58\n\four review of the caselaw convinces us that although a number of\n\ncourts have declined to recognize a parent-child privilege in one\n\nform or another, the vast majority of those cases, indeed all of\n\nthe federal cases, are distinguishable, on significant grounds,\n\nfrom the case before us.\n\n     Most cases discussing the availability of a parent-child\n\nprivilege have done so in the context of whether a child should\n\nbe compelled to testify against a parent.39   As the court of\n\nappeals acknowledged in In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Starr), 647\n\nF.2d 511, 513 n.4 (5th Cir. 1981), cases involving testimony by a\n\nchild regarding activities of or communications by a parent are\n\nnot as compelling as cases \"involv[ing] confidential\n\ncommunications from the chid to the parent\" because the former do\n\nnot implicate \"the desire to avoid discouraging a child from\n\n\n39.

The importance\n\nof this distinction was summarized by the Illinois Supreme Court\n\nin People v. Sanders, 457 N.E.2d 1241, 1246 (Ill. 1983).   The\n\ncourt in Sanders wrote that cases in which the parent-child\n\nprivilege has been upheld have\nrelied heavily upon conjecture that a family member who is\n     forced to testify against her will would face the\n     unpleasant choice of aiding the criminal conviction of\n     a loved one, perjuring herself on the stand, or risking\n     a citation for contempt of court for refusing to\n     testify and the belief that the harshness of this\n     choice has the effect of undermining the family\n     relationship. Such a fear is without foundation where,\n     as in this case, the witness who is a family member\n     volunteers her testimony. The voluntariness of the act\n     is strong evidence that the choice the witness faced\n     was an easy one for her to make.\n\n\n\n\n                                III.\n\n     While there is a substantial body of authority in which\n\ncourts have declined to recognize a parent-child privilege, none\n\nof the cases addresses under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence the issue of a parent's compelled testimony with respect\n\nto confidential advice-seeking statements made to the parent by\n43.       See, e.g., In re Terry W., 130 Cal. Rptr. at 914 n.1\n(\"The mother did not claim a `parent-child privilege.'\"); Cissna\nv. State, 352 N.E.2d 793, 795 (Ind. Ct. App. 1976); In re Frances\nJ., 456 A.2d 1174, 1177 (R.I. 1983) (noting that \"in all of the\ncases in which the privilege has been recognized, the proponent\nof the privilege has sought to preclude the compulsion of\ntestimony by a parent. In the case before us, on the other hand,\nrespondent has sought to inhibit or truncate the cross-\nexamination of her mother who had proposed to testify\nvoluntarily\").\n\n\n\n                                   62\n\fhis teenage son .44   The facts underlying the Virgin Islands\n\nappeal are critical to my conclusion that we should recognize a\n\n\n44.       This case is also distinguishable from the only two\nfederal decisions to have recognized some form of parent-child\nprivilege. In In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Greenberg), 11 Fed.\nR. Evid. Serv. (Callaghan) 579 (D. Conn. 1982), a mother asserted\na testimonial privilege to prevent being compelled to testify\nbefore a grand jury against her adult daughter. The privilege\nasserted was based on the mother's First Amendment free exercise\nclaim. Specifically, the mother claimed that as a conservative\nJew, she could not testify against her daughter without violating\na basic tenet of her religion which forbids a parent to testify\nagainst a child. The district court recognized a parent-child\nprivilege grounded in the First Amendment, holding that\n\"requiring Mrs. Greenberg to testify would interfere with her\nfree exercise of religion, though only to the extent that her\nanswers would incriminate her daughter.\" Id. at 582. The court\ndeclined to recognize a common-law privilege protecting\nconfidential parent-child communications in general, however,\nnoting that although compelled disclosure of non-incriminating\nconfidences might damage the relationship between the mother and\nher daughter, the harm would be less severe than if an\nunemancipated minor were involved. Id. at 586-87.\n\n           In In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Agosto), 553 F. Supp.\n1298 (D. Nev. 1983), the district court considered the motion of\na thirty-two year old son to quash a subpoena requiring him to\ntestify against his father. In granting the son's motion, the\ncourt recognized an expansive common-law testimonial privilege,\nholding that the government's interest in presenting all relevant\nevidence does not outweigh \"an individual's right of privacy in\nhis communications within the family unit, nor does it outweigh\nthe family's interest in its integrity and inviolability.\" Id.\nat 1325. The court supported its decision in part by reference\nto constitutional law affording protection for the family right\nof privacy, id. at 1310, and the \"expansive posture taken by\nCongress in enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 501.\" Id. at 1325.\n While I am in accord with the Agosto court with respect to the\nimportance of parent-child relationships, I am not prepared to\nsay that I would reach a similar result on similar facts. The\ncase presented in Agosto, involving as it did an adult child's\ntestimony against a parent, is far less compelling than the case\nnow before us. Furthermore, I would decline to adopt a broad\nrule of privilege and, recognizing the need for caution and\nrestraint, have narrowly drawn the privilege which I would\nrecognize.\n\n\n\n                                   63\n\fnarrowly circumscribed parent-child privilege.    The interests\n\ninvolved in protecting the communications at issue here are far\n\nstronger than those involved in previous cases.    Consequently,\n\nthe result which I would reach is not as radical as it might\n\ninitially appear.\n\n\n\n                              IV.\n\n     I am convinced that the public good to be derived from a\n\ncircumscribed parent-child testimonial privilege outweighs the\n\njudicial system's interest in compelled parental testimony.      I\n\nwould, therefore, recognize a privilege which could be invoked by\n\na parent and child together to bar compelled testimony concerning\n\nconfidential communications made to that parent by his child in\n\nthe course of seeking parental advice and guidance.    I would\n\nreverse the district court's order in the Virgin Islands matter\n\ndenying the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena.\n\n\n\n\n                                    64\n\f                                  V.\n\n        Although I am content with the disposition of the privilege\n\nissue in the Delaware matters, I must comment on what is, to me,\n\na disturbing aspect of these appeals.\n\n        Appellants in the Delaware cases attack the propriety of the\n\nsubpoenas issued to the minor, arguing that the government failed\n\nto make the minimum disclosure of the grand jury's purpose\n\nrequired by our decisions in In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n(Schofield I), 486 F.3d 85 (3d Cir. 1973), and In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings (Schofield II), 507 F.2d 963, 966 (3d Cir. 1975).\n\nThese cases establish that a party seeking enforcement of a grand\n\njury proceeding is required to make\na minimum showing by affidavit . . . that each item sought\n     was (1) relevant to an investigation, (2) properly\n     within the grand jury's jurisdiction, and (3) not\n     sought primarily for another purpose.\n\n\n507 F.2d at 966.    While the information supplied in the affidavit\n\nmay be \"scant,\" it must give \"the trial judge some basis for\n\ndetermining that the three-pronged test . . . has[s] been met.\"\n\nId. at 967.\n\n     It would be an overstatement to characterize the information\n\ncontained in the affidavit submitted here as even \"scant\" as the\n\naffidavit contains nothing at all beyond a mere recitation of the\n\nSchofield requirements.     Our Schofield decisions, if they mean\n\nanything at all, require something, albeit a small something,\n\nmore.\n\n\n\n\n                                       65\n\f     My concern over erosion of the Schofield requirements is\n\nobviated in this case by the further proceedings conducted by the\n\ndistrict court to ensure the need for the minor daughter's\n\ntestimony.   Were it not for these further proceedings, I am\n\nconvinced that reliance on the affidavit as it was written would\n\nhave been error.\n\n\n\n\n                                   66\n\f67\n\f",

One appeal originated in the District Court of the\n\nVirgin Islands at docket number 95-7354.      The other two appeals\n\npertaining to the same Delaware defendant originated in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\fDistrict Court of Delaware at docket numbers 96-7529 and 96-\n\n7530.1\n\n          We scheduled oral argument in all three appeals on the\n\nsame day inasmuch as they raised the same question - should this\n\ncourt recognize a parent-child privilege?     The Delaware appeals\n\nalso challenge the adequacy of a Schofield affidavit and charge\n\nthat the in camera ex parte proceeding permitted by the district\n\ncourt constituted a deprivation of due process.     We answer the\n\nquestions presented by holding that a parent-child privilege\n\nshould not be recognized, and we affirm the district court's\n\nrulings which rejected the appellants' objections to the\n\nSchofield affidavit and in camera ex parte proceeding.\n\n\n                               I.\n\n          The facts and procedure of the Virgin Islands case\n\ngiving rise to one appeal, and of the Delaware case giving rise\n\nto two appeals, will be stated separately.2\n\n\n\n1. Throughout this opinion, where separate identification of the\nappeals is appropriate, we will refer to the appeal which came\nfrom the District Court of the Virgin Islands as the \"Virgin\nIslands appeal\" and the appeals from the District of Delaware as\nthe \"Delaware appeals\".\n\n2. Due to the nature of the proceedings, the district courts in\nboth matters impounded the entire record in each case to protect\nthe privacy interests of the parties. Consequently, we do not\nidentify by name either the father or the son who is the target\nof the grand jury investigation in the Virgin Islands case; nor\nthe daughter or the father who is the target of the grand jury\ninvestigation in the Delaware case.\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\f           Docket Number 95-7354: In the Virgin Islands case, the\n\ngrand jury sitting in St. Croix subpoenaed the father of the\n\ntarget of the grand jury investigation as a witness.3     The target\n\nof the grand jury proceeding was the son of the subpoenaed\n\nwitness.   The son became the target of a government investigation\n\nas a result of \"certain transactions that [he] was allegedly\n\ninvolved in.\"   Tr. at 11.   At the time of the alleged\n\ntransactions, the son was eighteen years old.\n\n           The grand jury subpoenaed the target's father to\n\ntestify on April 18, 1995.    The father, a former FBI agent, lived\n\nwith his wife and son in St. Croix.     On April 17, 1995, based on\n\nhis belief that the grand jury intended to question him about\n\nconversations that he had had with his son, the father moved to\n\nquash the subpoena, asserting that those conversations were\n\nprivileged from disclosure under Fed. R. Evid. 501.\n\n           The father testified, at a hearing before the district\n\ncourt, that he and his son \"ha[d] an excellent relationship, very\n\nclose, very loving relationship.\"    Tr. at 4.

The\n\n\n\n\n3. The term of the grand jury in the Virgin Islands case was to\nhave ended on September 17, 1996. However, by Order of the\nDistrict Court of the Virgin Islands entered on September 3,\n1996, the term was extended until March 17, 1997.\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\ffather further explained that the subpoena would impact\n\nnegatively upon his relationship with his son:\nI will be living under a cloud in which if my son comes to me or\n          talks to me, I've got to be very careful what he says,\n          what I allow him to say. I would have to stop him and\n          say, \"you can't talk to me about that. You've got to\n          talk to your attorney.\" It's no way for anybody to\n          live in this country.\n\n\nId. at 6.\n\n            On June 19, 1995, the district court entered its order\n\ndenying the father's motion to quash.    On the same day, the\n\ndistrict court granted the targeted son's motion to intervene and\n\nthen stayed its order which denied the quashing of the father's\n\nsubpoena pending any appeal.   The court's memorandum opinion and\n\norder, although clearly sympathetic with the plight of the\n\nsubpoenaed father, \"regretfully decline[d] to recognize [a\n\nparent-child] privilege\" because the Third Circuit had yet to\n\naddress the issue and \"every United States Court of Appeals that\n\nhas confronted this question has declined to recognize the\n\nparent-child privilege.\"   In re Grand Jury Proceeding, Misc. No.\n\n95-0009, at 14 (D.V.I. June 19, 1995).    Appeal of the June 19,\n\n1995 order was promptly taken by the targeted son on June 22,\n\n1995.4\n\n\n\n4. The original appeal in the Virgin Islands case was heard in\nSt. Thomas by a panel of this court of which Judge Sarokin was a\nmember. Prior to the filing of an opinion, Judge Sarokin retired\nfrom office and Judge Greenberg replaced him on the panel. Panel\nrehearing was ordered.\n\n\n\n                                    6\n\f          Docket Numbers 96-7529 & 96-7530:    In the Delaware\n\ncase, a sixteen year old minor daughter was subpoenaed to testify\n\nbefore the grand jury, as part of an investigation into her\n\nfather's participation in an alleged interstate kidnapping of a\n\nwoman who had disappeared.     The daughter was scheduled to\n\ntestify on September 10, 1996.    However, on September 9, 1996, a\n\nmotion to quash subpoena was made by counsel for the daughter and\n\nher mother, as well as by separate counsel for the father.5\n\n          The motion sought to bar the testimony of the daughter\n\nclaiming a parent-child privilege which would cover testimony and\n\nconfidential communications.     \"[T]he privilege [was] claimed for\n\nconfidential communications as well as for protection against\n\nbeing compelled to testify in a criminal proceeding\".    Joint\n\nMotion to Quash Subpoena at ¶ 5.\n\n          The district court held a hearing during the morning of\n\nSeptember 10, 1996; ordered further briefing due that afternoon6;\n\nand issued a ruling in the late afternoon denying the motion to\n\n5. It appears that although the mother and father of the minor\nwitness have taken similar positions in this litigation, albeit\nby different counsel, at the time of these proceedings, they were\nseparated.\n\n6. The additional briefing was on the issue of whether the\ndaughter's testimony would be material and non-duplicative.\nDuring the hearing, the district court placed the burden on the\ngovernment to make a substantial showing that this threshold was\nmet. The government filed a Schofield affidavit, see infra, and\nvolunteered to furnish further particulars at an in camera ex\nparte hearing. The parents and daughter opposed the in camera ex\nparte proceeding, arguing that if they were foreclosed from\nlistening to the government's proffer, there would be no basis\nupon which they could rebut the evidence presented.\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\fquash and ordering the minor daughter to testify before the grand\n\njury that evening.\n\n          In the order, the district court reasoned that, because\n\nthere is \"no recognized familial privilege\", the appropriate\n\nprocess for determining whether to grant the motion to quash was\n\n\"to weigh the competing interests of the parties in order to\n\ndetermine whether the anticipated testimony of the minor child is\n\nmaterial and nonduplicative, thus tipping the scales toward\n\nrequiring the testimony\".   In re Grand Jury, 96-cv-51, at 1 (D.\n\nDel. September 10, 1996).   The district court concluded that,\n\nbased on the government's in camera ex parte proffer, \"the\n\ngovernment's interests in compelling the testimony outweigh the\n\nprivacy interests asserted by the moving parties\" and denied the\n\nmotion to quash on those grounds.   See id. at 2.\n\n          Pursuant to the court order, the daughter appeared at\n\ncourt (in an ante-room to the grand jury courtroom) in the\n\nevening of September 10, 1995.   She refused to testify and was\n\nfound in contempt.   The district court then stayed the imposition\n\nof sanctions during the pendency of these appeals.   Appeal of the\n\nSeptember 10, 1996 order was promptly made in joint motions by\n\nmother and daughter, and father on September 13, 1996.7\n\n\n\n7. The appeals in the Delaware case were expedited by this court\nso that the common issue of parent-child privilege could be heard\nand resolved in the Delaware and Virgin Island cases at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\f          The district courts had jurisdiction over both the\n\nVirgin Islands case and Delaware case under 18 U.S.C. § 3231.

This requirement stems from\n\nthe Schofield cases (I and II) where the targeted defendant had\n\nrefused to furnish handwriting exemplars and had refused to allow\n\nher fingerprints and photograph to be taken.    We have commonly\n\nreferred to such an affidavit as a Schofield affidavit.8\n\n          Appellants in the Delaware case argue that the\n\ngovernment's Schofield affidavit9 was insufficient since it was\n\n\"simply a mere recitation of the requirements, rather than a\n\nsubstantive document and was not sufficient to enable the\n\nDistrict Court to properly balance the interests of the parties.\"\n\n Brief of Appellant Doe #1 at 21.   They argue further that \"The\n\nGovernment's affidavit does not meet. . . [the Schofield II]\n\ntest. . . It is written in conclusory terms and makes no effort\n8. In Schofield II, we held that the affidavit complying with\nthis three-pronged requirement sufficed to meet the government's\nburden and hence we upheld the government's subpoena. See\nSchofield II, 507 F.2d at 963.\n\n9. The affidavit stated that the daughter's testimony would be\n\"essential and necessary\" and \"relevant\" to the grand jury\ninvestigation; that the testimony was \"properly within the Grand\nJury's jurisdiction\" and was \"not sought primarily for any other\npurpose\".

It \"provide[s] a\n\nminimum disclosure of the grand jury's purpose\" by demonstrating\n\nthat the daughter's testimony would be \"at least relevant to an\n\ninvestigation being conducted by the grand jury and properly\n\nwithin its jurisdiction, and is not sought primarily for another\n\npurpose\".    Schofield II, 507 F.2d at 965 (citing Schofield I,\n\n486 F.2d at 93).     These elements satisfy the minimal disclosure\n\nrequirements of Schofield II.\n\n            The district court could, of course, in its discretion,\n\nrequire additional information.    See Schofield II, 507 F.2d at\n\n965.   Here the district court exercised its discretion by not\n\nrequiring anything additional in the affidavit, but decided\n\ninstead to hold a hearing on the government's proffer and to do\n\nso in camera and ex parte.\n\n            We hold that the government met its burden of proof\n\nwith regard to the adequacy of the Schofield affidavit, and since\nthe appellants have not demonstrated that the affidavit was\n\ninsufficient or that there was an abuse of the grand jury\n\nprocess, we are persuaded that the district court did not err in\n\nfinding the Schofield affidavit proper.   See Schofield I, 486\n\n\n\n                                    11\n\fF.2d at 92 (\"the party objecting to the enforcement has the\n\nburden of making some showing of irregularity\"); Schofield II,\n\n507 F.2d at 965 (\"the burden is generally on the witness to show\n\nabuse of the grand jury process\").\n\n          Appellants next argue that the district court erred in\n\nconducting the in camera hearing ex parte.   They contend that\n\nthey were prejudiced by their inability to respond to the\n\ngovernment's proffer and that therefore their due process rights\n\nwere violated.10   We cannot agree.\n\n          District courts have considerable discretion in\n\ndetermining whether additional proceedings - beyond the Schofield\n\naffidavit - are warranted, including in camera hearings.     See\n\nSchofield I, 486 F.2d at 93; see generally United States v.\n\nZolin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (1988).\n\n          The purpose of the in camera hearing was to aid the\n\ndistrict court in balancing the government's need for the\n\ndaughter's testimony against the privacy concerns of the daughter\n\nand her family.    The district court placed a threshold burden on\n\nthe government to demonstrate the materiality and non-duplicative\n\nnature of the daughter's testimony, in order that it could\n\ndetermine whether the testimony was necessary for the grand jury\n\nproceedings, or whether instead, it should grant appellants'\n\nmotion to quash.\n10. Appellants cite 18 U.S.C. § 3509(a)(2) (Supp. 1996) as\nsupport for their argument; however, we note that this provision,\nconcerning child abuse, has no relevance to the present matter.\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f          The government's proffer was presented in camera and\n\nheard ex parte in order to protect the confidentiality of the\n\ngrand jury proceeding.

In her dissenting and concurring opinion, Judge Mansmann\nregisters disturbance because of the Schofield procedure employed\nby the district court. See Dissenting Opinion at 20-21.\n          We are bound by Schofield. See I.O.P. § 9.1.

Appellants argue that recognition is\n\nnecessary in order to advance important public policy interests\n\nsuch as the protection of strong and trusting parent-child\n\nrelationships; the preservation of the family; safeguarding of\n\nprivacy interests and protection from harmful government\n\nintrusion; and the promotion of healthy psychological development\n\nof children.    See Brief of Appellant in Virgin Islands case at 8-\n\n9; Brief of Appellant Doe #1 at 9-14; Brief of Appellant Doe #2\n\nat 10-20.    These public policy arguments echo those advanced by\n\nacademicians and other legal commentators in the myriad of law\n\nreview articles discussing the parent-child testimonial\n\nprivilege.12\n(..continued)\nparte hearing which we have found to be within the Schofield\ndoctrine.

New York is the only state which has a judicially-recognized\nparent-child privilege; however, the privilege has only been\nrecognized by inferior New York courts.\n          Idaho and Minnesota are the only states which have\nrecognized a variant of the parent-child privilege through\nstatute.   See Idaho Code § 9-203(7) (1990 & Supp. 1995); Minn.\nStat. § 595.02(1)(j) (1988 & Supp. 1996).   It is important to\nnote that neither statute is rooted in the common law.\n\n\n                                  15\n\f          (c)No state within the Third Circuit has recognized a\n               parent-child privilege.\n\n(2)No reasoned analysis of Federal Rule of Evidence 501 or of the\n          standards established by the Supreme Court or by this\n          court supports the creation of a privilege.\n\n(3)Creation of such a privilege would have no impact on the\n          parental relationship and hence would neither benefit\n          that relationship nor serve any social policy.\n\n(4)Although we have the authority to recognize a new privilege,\n          we believe the recognition of such a privilege, if one\n          is to be recognized, should be left to Congress.\n\n\nA.FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS HAVE DECLINED TO RECOGNIZE A PARENT-\n     CHILD PRIVILEGE.\n\n     1.Eight Federal Courts of Appeals Have Explicitly Rejected\n          the Privilege and None of the Remaining Courts of\n          Appeals Have Recognized the Privilege.\n\n\n          The appellants rely primarily upon law review articles\n\nrather than case law authority to support the position that a\n\nparent-child testimonial privilege should be recognized.   No case\n\nlaw recognizing such a privilege exists.   On the other hand, the\n\neight federal Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue\n\nhave uniformly declined to recognize a parent-child privilege.\n\n(..continued)\n          Massachusetts law prevents a minor child from\ntestifying against a parent in a criminal proceeding. However,\nthe statute does not go so far as to recognize a parent-child\ntestimonial privilege. First, the Massachusetts statute does not\ncreate a testimonial privilege; rather it is best described as a\nwitness-disqualification rule.   Second, the testimonial bar is\nnot of common-law origin but is statutory.

For example, New York's Court of Appeals declined to\napply the parent-child privilege to a murder confession made by a\n28 year old defendant to his mother, due to defendant's age; lack\nof confidentiality; subject of conversation; and the fact that\nthe mother had already testified in front of grand jury\nproceeding.

Conn. 1982).\n\n          In Agosto, the thirty-two-year-old son of an alleged\n\ntax evader moved to quash a subpoena ad testificandum requiring\n\nhim to testify against his father.    See Agosto, 553 F. Supp. at\n\n1299. Although the district court recognized a common-law\n\nprivilege, it did so in derogation of the prevailing\n\njurisprudence of the Ninth Circuit, which, in an en banc\n\ndecision, had expressly rejected a parent-child privilege.       See\n\nUnited States v. Penn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390032\"><a href=\"/opinion/390032/united-states-v-clara-b-penn-aka-clara-b-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.)

Agosto therefore conflicts squarely\n\nwith its own circuit's en banc precedent.    It is not surprising\n\nthat in her dissent, Judge Mansmann, although apparently\n\napproving of the reasoning in Agosto and citing to it on pages 11\n\nand 18 n.17, is no more persuaded by Agosto than we are.\n\n          In Greenberg, a mother sought relief from a civil\n\ncontempt charge when she refused to testify before a federal\n\ngrand jury in order to protect her adult daughter, who had been\n\nindicted by a Florida grand jury for importation of marijuana.\n\nSee Greenberg, 11 Fed. R. Serv. at 580.     The district court\n\nrecognized a limited testimonial privilege grounded in the First\n\nAmendment free exercise clause; however, the court declined to\n\nrecognize a general common-law parent-child privilege.\n\n\n\n                                     21\n\f          Observing that the daughter, as an adult, did not\n\nrequire the same degree of guidance and support as a young child,\n\nthe court reasoned that although compelled disclosure of\n\nnonincriminating confidences might damage the relationship\n\nbetween the mother and her daughter, the harm would be less\n\nsevere than if an unemancipated minor were involved.    See id. at\n\n586-87.   Concluding that this lesser degree of harm did not\n\noutweigh the state's need for the testimony, the district court\n\nheld that the facts did not justify the creation of a common-law\n\nparent-child privilege.   See id. at 587.   Greenberg therefore\n\ndoes not support the creation of a general testimonial parent-\n\nchild privilege; furthermore, its limited holding does not extend\n\nto the present matter since religious principles are not\n\nimplicated here.\n\nB.THE STANDARDS PRESCRIBED BY FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 501 DO NOT\n     SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A PRIVILEGE.\n\n\n          Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that \"the privi-\n\nlege of a witness . . . shall be governed by the principles of\n\nthe common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the\n\nUnited States in the light of reason and experience.\"    No such\n\nprinciple, interpretation, reason or experience has been drawn\n\nupon here.\n\n          It is true that Congress, in enacting Fed. R. Evid.\n\n501, \"manifested an affirmative intention not to freeze the law\n\nof privilege.   Its purpose rather was to 'provide the courts with\n\n\n                                   22\n\fthe flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case\n\nbasis,' and to leave the door open to change.\"     Trammel v.

(quoting Trammel, 445 U.S. at 51), must be guided\n\nby \"reason and experience.\"   Specifically, the Jaffee Court in-\n\nstructed that a federal court should look to the \"experience\" of\n\nstate courts:   \"[T]he policy decision of the States bear on the\n\nquestion [of] whether federal courts should recognize a new\n\nprivilege or amend the coverage of an existing one.\"    Id. at\n1929-30.\n\n           Notably, in recognizing a psychotherapist-patient\n\nprivilege, the Supreme Court relied on the fact that all fifty\n\n\n\n                                   25\n\fstates had enacted some form of a psychotherapist privilege.     Id.\n\nat 1929 & n.11 (listing state statutes).     The Jaffee Court ex-\n\nplained that \"it is appropriate to treat a consistent body of\n\npolicy determinations by state legislatures as reflecting both\n\n'reason' and 'experience.'\"   Id. at 1930.\n\n          Here, by contrast, only four states have deemed it\n\nnecessary to protect from disclosure, in any manner, confidential\n\ncommunications between children and their parents.    As previously\n\nnoted, New York state courts have recognized a limited parent-\n\nchild privilege, and Idaho and Minnesota have enacted limited\n\nstatutory privileges protecting confidential communications by\n\nminors to their parents.   See supra notes 13 & 15.    In\n\nMassachusetts, as we have noted, minor children are statutorily\n\ndisqualified from testifying against their parents in criminal\n\nproceedings.   See id.   No state within the Third Circuit has\n\nadopted a parent-child privilege.\n\n          The policy determinations of these four states do not\n\nconstitute a \"consistent body of policy determinations by\n\nstate[s]\" supporting recognition of a parent-child privilege.\n\nIndeed, if anything, the fact that the overwhelming majority of\n\nstates have chosen not to create a parent-child privilege sup-\nports the opposite conclusion:   \"reason and experience\" dictate\n\nthat federal courts should refuse to recognize a privilege\n\nrejected by the vast majority of jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\f          The Jaffee Court also relied on the fact that the\n\npsychotherapist-patient privilege was among the nine specific\n\nprivileges recommended by the Advisory Committee on Rules of\n\nEvidence in 1972.

Ct. at 1930.\n\n          In the instant cases, in contrast to the psychothera-\n\npist-patient privilege recognized in Jaffee, the parent-child\n\nprivilege, like the state legislative privilege rejected in\n\nGillock, was not among the enumerated privileges submitted by the\n\nAdvisory Committee.    Although this fact, in and of itself, is not\n\ndispositive with respect to the question as to whether this court\n\nshould create a privilege, it strongly suggests that the Advisory\n\nCommittee, like the majority of state legislatures, did not\n\nregard confidential parent-child communications sufficiently\n\nimportant to warrant \"privilege\" protection.\n\n          A federal court should give due consideration, and\n\naccord proper weight, to the judgment of the Advisory Committee\n\nand of state legislatures on this issue when it evaluates whether\n\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fit is appropriate to create a new privilege pursuant to Rule 501.\n\n\n\n     2.      Third Circuit\n\n           Under the analytic framework set forth in this court's\n\nprecedents, creating a parent-child privilege would be ill-\n\nadvised.   In In re Grand Jury Investigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551291\"><a href=\"/opinion/551291/in-re-grand-jury-investigation-appeal-of-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\n\nCir. 1990) (Becker, J.), we adopted a clergy-communicant\n\nprivilege.    We did so, however, only after examining the state\n\nand federal precedents addressing the issue of a clergy-\n\ncommunicant privilege and after determining that these\n\nprecedents, on balance, weighed in favor of recognizing such a\n\nprivilege.    Id. at 379-84.   Indeed, we instructed that an\n\nexamination of such precedents was mandatory:\nBoth the history and the language of Rule 501, therefore,\n     provide us with a mandate to develop evidentiary\n     privileges in accordance with common law principles.\n     This mandate, in turn, requires us to examine federal\n     and state case law and impels us to consult treatises\n     and commentaries on the law of evidence that elucidate\n     the development of the common law.\n\n\nId. at 379.\n\n           Moreover, like the Jaffee Court and perhaps in antici-\n\npation of Jaffee's instructions, Judge Becker considered the\n\"reason and experience\" of the state legislatures and of the\n\nAdvisory Committee.    First, Judge Becker, writing for a unanimous\n\npanel, noted that \"virtually every state has recognized some form\n\nof a clergy-communicant privilege.\"      Id. at 381 & n.10 (listing\n\nstate statutes).\n\n\n\n                                    28\n\f          In addition, Judge Becker posited that \"the proposed\n\nrules prove a useful reference point and offer guidance in\n\ndefining the existence and scope of evidentiary privileges in the\n\nfederal courts.\" Id. at 380. Judge Becker further explained:\n\"[I]n many instances, the proposed rules, [used as]\n     [s]tandards, remain a convenient and useful starting\n     point for examining questions of privilege. The\n     [s]tandards are the culmination of three drafts\n     prepared by an Advisory Committee consisting of judges,\n     practicing lawyers and academicians. . . . Finally,\n     they were adopted by the Supreme Court. . . .\n     . . . .\n     . . . [T]he Advisory Committee in drafting the\n     Standards was for the most part restating the law\n     currently applied in the federal courts.\n\n\nId. at 380-81 (quoting J. Weinstein & M. Berger, Weinstein's\n\nEvidence ¶ 501[03] (1987)).   Judge Becker then concluded that\n\n\"[t]he inclusion of the clergy-communicant privilege in the\n\nproposed rules, taken together with its uncontroversial nature,\n\nstrongly suggests that [that] privilege is, in the words of the\n\nSupreme Court, 'indelibly ensconced' in the American common law.\"\n\nId. at 381 (quoting Gillock, 445 U.S. at 368).    Judge Becker\n\nalso provided a detailed exegesis of the historical development\n\nof the clergy-communicant privilege, stressing that common-law\n\ntradition, as reflected in practice and case law, supported\n\nrecognition of such a privilege.\n\n          In contrast, the parent-child privilege sought to be\n\nrecognized here is of relatively recent vintage, see Ismail, 756\nF.2d at 1257-58 (\"The parent-child privilege did not exist at\n\ncommon law\"), and is virtually no more than the product of legal\n\n\n\n                                   29\n\facademicians.   See supra note 12.   Unlike, for example, the\n\nattorney-client privilege, which is \"the oldest\" common-law\n\nprivilege, see United States v.

Dean Wigmore's four-factor formula requires\n\nsatisfaction of all four factors in order to establish a\n\nprivilege:\n(1) The communications must originate in a confidence that\n     they will not be disclosed.\n(2) This element of confidentiality must be essential to the\n     full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation\n     between the parties.\n(3) The relation must be one which in the opinion of the\n     community ought to be sedulously fostered.\n(4) The injury that would inure to the relation by the\n     disclosure of the communications must be greater than\n     the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of\n     litigation.\n\n\nIn re Grand Jury Investigation, 918 F.2d at 384 (quoting 8 John\n\nH. Wigmore, Evidence § 2285 (J. McNaughton rev. ed. 1961))\n\n(emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).\n\n          At least two of Wigmore's prerequisite conditions for\n\ncreation of a federal common-law privilege are not met under the\n\nfacts of these cases.    We refer to the second and fourth elements\n\nof the Wigmore test.20\n20. The most recent case addressing a parent-child privilege\nanalyzed the privilege under the Wigmore four-factor test, and\n\n\n                                     30\n\f          First, confidentiality--in the form of a testimonial\n\nprivilege--is not essential to a successful parent-child\n\nrelationship, as required by the second factor.   A privilege\n\nshould be recognized only where such a privilege would be\n\nindispensable to the survival of the relationship that society\n\ndeems should be fostered.   For instance, because complete candor\n\nand full disclosure by the client is absolutely necessary in\n\norder for the attorney to function effectively, society recogniz-\n\nes an attorney-client privilege.   Without a guarantee of secrecy,\n\nclients would be unwilling to reveal damaging information.     As a\n\ncorollary, clients would disclose negative information, which an\n\nattorney must know to prove effective representation, only if\n\nthey were assured that such disclosures are privileged.\n\n          In contrast, it is not clear whether children would be\n\nmore likely to discuss private matters with their parents if a\n\nparent-child privilege were recognized than if one were not.    It\n\nis not likely that children, or even their parents, would\n\ntypically be aware of the existence or non-existence of a\n\ntestimonial privilege covering parent-child communications.     On\n\nthe other hand, professionals such as attorneys, doctors and\n\nmembers of the clergy would know of the privilege that attends\n\ntheir respective profession, and their clients, patients or\n\n(..continued)\ndeclined to adopt the privilege after determining that the\nprivilege failed to satisfy two of the four factors - the same\nfactors which are not satisfied here. See In re Inquest\nProceedings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2099719\"><a href=\"/opinion/2099719/in-re-inquest-proceedings/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Vt. 1996).\n\n\n\n                                   31\n\fparishioners would also be aware that their confidential conver-\n\nsations are protected from compelled disclosure.21\n\n          Moreover, even assuming arguendo that children and\n\ntheir parents generally are aware of whether or not their commu-\n\nnications are protected from disclosure, it is not certain that\n\nthe existence of a privilege enters into whatever thought\n\nprocesses are performed by children in deciding whether or not to\n\nconfide in their parents.   Indeed, the existence or nonexistence\n\nof a parent-child privilege is probably one of the least\n\nimportant considerations in any child's decision as to whether to\n\nreveal some indiscretion, legal or illegal, to a parent.\n\nMoreover, it is unlikely that any parent would choose to deter a\n\nchild from revealing a confidence to the parent solely because a\n\nfederal court has refused to recognize a privilege protecting\n\nsuch communications from disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n21. Notably, the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Evidence\nreached a similar conclusion with respect to a marital\ncommunications privilege. The Advisory Committee explained:\n\n          [Proposed Rule 505] recognizes no privilege for\n     confidential communications [between spouses]. . . .\n     [It cannot] be assumed that marital conduct will be\n     affected by a privilege for confidential communications\n     of whose existence the parties in all likelihood are\n     unaware. The other communication privileges, by way of\n     contrast, have as one party a professional person who\n     can be expected to inform the other of the existence of\n     the privilege.\n\nProposed Fed. R. Evid. 505 advisory committee's note, 56 F.R.D.\nat 245-46.\n\n\n\n                                   32\n\f          Finally, the proposed parent-child privilege fails to\n\nsatisfy the fourth condition of the Wigmore test.    As explained\n\nabove, any injury to the parent-child relationship resulting from\n\nnon-recognition of such a privilege would be relatively\n\ninsignificant.   In contrast, the cost of recognizing such a\n\nprivilege is substantial:    the impairment of the truth-seeking\n\nfunction of the judicial system and the increased likelihood of\n\ninjustice resulting from the concealment of relevant information.\n\nSee United States v. Nixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 709 (1974) (stating\n\nthat \"[t]he need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary\n\nsystem is both fundamental and comprehensive\").\n\n          Moreover, because no clear benefit flows from the\n\nrecognition of a parent-child privilege, any injury to the\n\nparent-child relationship caused by compelled testimony as to\n\nconfidential communications is necessarily and substantially out-\n\nweighed by the benefit to society of obtaining all relevant\n\nevidence in a criminal case.

In short, the public good derived from\n\nmaintaining the confidentiality of parent-child communications\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\ftranscends the value of effective and efficient judicial truth-\n\nfinding.\n\n           An even more compelling reason for rejecting a parent-\n\nchild privilege stems from the fact that the parent-child\n\nrelationship differs dramatically from other relationships.         This\n\nis due to the unique duty owing to the child from the parent.        A\n\nparent owes the duty to the child to nurture and guide the child.\n\n This duty is unusual because it inheres in the relationship and\n\nthe relationship arises automatically at the child's birth.\n\n           If, for example, a fifteen year old unemancipated child\n\ninforms her parent that she has committed a crime or has been\n\nusing or distributing narcotics, and this disclosure has been\n\nmade in confidence while the child is seeking guidance, it is\n\nevident to us that, regardless of whether the child consents or\n\nnot, the parent must have the right to take such action as the\n\nparent deems appropriate in the interest of the child.       That\n\naction could be commitment to a drug rehabilitation center or a\n\nreport of the crime to the juvenile authorities.    This is so\n\nbecause, in theory at least, juvenile proceedings are undertaken\n\nsolely in the interest of the child.    We would regard it\n\nintolerable in such a situation if the law intruded in the guise\n\nof a privilege, and silenced the parent because the child had a\n\nprivilege to prevent disclosure.\n\n           This results in the analysis that any privilege, if\n\nrecognized, must be dependent upon both the parent and child\n\n\n\n                                   34\n\fasserting it.   However, in such a case, the privilege would\n\ndisappear if the parent can waive it.   It follows therefore that,\n\nif a child is able to communicate openly with a parent and seeks\n\nguidance from that parent, the entire basis for the privilege is\n\ndestroyed if the child is required to recognize that confidence\n\nwill be maintained only so long as the parent wants the\n\nconversation to be confidential.   If, however, the parent can\n\nwaive the privilege unilaterally, the goal of the privilege is\n\ndestroyed.   When the Supreme Court authorized a psychotherapist-\n\npatient privilege in Jaffee, it told us as much in stating,\n\n\n     We part company with the Court of Appeals on a\n          separate point. We reject the balancing\n          component of the privilege implemented by\n          that court and a small number of States.\n          Making the promise of confidentiality\n          contingent upon a trial judge's later\n          evaluation of the relative importance of the\n          patient's interest in privacy and evidentiary\n          need for disclosure would eviscerate the\n          effectiveness of the privilege. As we\n          explained in Upjohn, if the purpose of the\n          privilege is to be served, the participants\n          in the confidential conversation 'must be\n          able to predict with some degree of certainty\n          whether particular discussions will be\n          protected. An uncertain privilege, or one\n          which purports to be certain but results in\n          widely varying applications by the courts, is\n          little better than no privilege at all.'\n\n\n\nJaffee v.

Congress,\n\nthrough its legislative mechanisms, is also better suited for the\n\ntask of defining the scope of any prospective privilege.22\n\n     Congress, is able to consider, for example, society's moral,\n\nsociological, economic, religious and other values without being\n\nconfined to the evidentiary record in any particular case.    Thus,\n\nin determining whether a parent-child privilege should obtain,\n\nCongress can take into consideration a host of facts and factors\n\nwhich the judiciary may be unable to consider.   These\n\nconsiderations are also relevant to determining whether the\n\nprivilege, if it is to be recognized, should extend to adult\n\nchildren, adopted children or unemancipated minors.23\n\n22.

Nor do any state statutes\nprovide a privilege for emancipated children. Indeed, both Idaho\nand Minnesota, by statute, limit their variants of the parent-\nchild privilege to children under age 18. See Idaho Code §§ 9-\n203(7), 32-101 (1990 & Supp. 1995); Minn. Stat. §§ 595.02(1)(j),\n645.451 (1988 & Supp. 1996).\n           In the present case, of course, the daughter in the\nDelaware appeals is 16 years old and unemancipated. Hence, the\nissue of extending the privilege to an adult or an emancipated\nchild is not relevant insofar as the Delaware target is\nconcerned. However, the appellant-son in the Virgin Islands\ncase, who was 18 years old at the time of the relevant\ncommunication, and, therefore, no longer a minor nor\nunemancipated, urges that the privilege be unrestricted with\nregard to age. Under Virgin Islands law, the son would be deemed\nemancipated. See V.I. Code Ann. tit. 16, § 261 (providing that\nthe age of majority in the Virgin Islands is 18 years old); V.I.\nCode Ann. tit. 16, § 221(4) (minor becomes \"emancipat[ed]\" by\nreason of having attained the age of majority\"); see also In Re\nGuardianship of Penn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661718\"><a href=\"/opinion/661718/in-re-guardianship-of-kory-penn-kaseem-penn-and-kai-moolenaar-kai/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting\nthat Virgin Islands legislature, in 1972, lowered the age of\nmajority from 21 to 18); Galvan v.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained that one basis\n\nfor its disinclination to recognize new privileges is deference\n\nto the legislature:\n     We are especially reluctant to recognize a privilege in an\n     area where it appears that Congress has considered the\n     relevant competing concerns but has not provided the\n     privilege itself.\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493 U.S. at 189.\n            Congress too has recognized the importance of privilege\n\nrules insofar as the truth-seeking process is concerned.   Con-\n\ngress specifically addressed that subject when it delegated rule-\n\nmaking authority to the Supreme Court as to rules of procedure\n\nand evidence.   It did so by identifying and designating the law\n\n\n                                    39\n\fof privileges as a special area meriting greater legislative\n\noversight.    Congress expressly provided that \"[a]ny . . . rule\n\ncreating, abolishing, or modifying an evidentiary privilege shall\n\nhave no force or effect unless approved by Act of Congress.\"       28\n\nU.S.C. § 2074(b) (1994).     In contrast, all other evidentiary\n\nrules promulgated by the Supreme Court and transmitted to\n\nCongress automatically take effect unless Congress enacts a\n\nstatute to the contrary.    See 28 U.S.C. § 2074(a) (1994).24\n\n\n                                 IV.\n\n             A few further observations about the dissent and why it\n\ndoes not persuade us that the parent-child privilege outweighs\n\nthe government's interest in disclosure:\n\n             First, in her dissenting and concurring opinion, Judge\n\nMansmann attempts to distinguish the Virgin Islands appeal (where\n\na father has been subpoenaed to testify about communications made\n\nto him by his son who is over the age of eighteen25), from the\n\n24. The preferred method by which any Rule of Evidence would be\nproposed and ultimately promulgated would be by proceeding:\nfirst, through the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, then\nto the Judicial Conference Standing Committee on Practice and\nProcedure (with public notice and comment at both these stages),\nthen to the Judicial Conference of the United States, and then,\nof course, to the Supreme Court, which, if the proposed Rule was\napproved, would then transmit the proposed Rule to Congress for\nits consideration. See 28 U.S.C. § 2072, et seq.; 18 U.S.C. §§\n3402, 3771, 3772.\n\n25. Because the son is over eighteen years of age, under Judge\nMansmann's formulation of the privilege, we assume there would\nhave to be a hearing by the district court to assess various\nfactors to determine whether a privilege would lie (since Judge\nMansmann declines to adopt a bright-line rule with regard to\n\n\n                                       40\n\fDelaware appeal (where a teenage daughter has been subpoenaed to\n\ngive testimony against her father).     The record of the Delaware\n\nappeal, however, does not inform us as to the nature of the\n\ntestimony being sought or the nature of the daughter's knowledge.\n\n Does it arise from observations, overheard statements,\n\ncommunications with her father, or some other source?    If indeed\n\nit arises from confidential communications, does the privilege\n\nadvocated by Judge Mansmann in the Virgin Islands case then\n\napply?   If so, is the alleged distinction a valid one, or do both\n\nappeals suffer from the same deficiencies we have identified with\n\nrespect to any parent-child privilege?\n\n          Secondly, we note that the Virgin Islands privilege\n\nwhich Judge Mansmann would recognize, while characterized as a\n\nlimited one, would only come into play where a child has made a\n\nconfidential communication to a parent in the course of seeking\n\nparental advice.   See Dissenting Opinion at 7.26   Both of these\n\n(..continued)\nage). These \"factors\" would include such variables as age,\nmaturity, the child's residence and the precise nature of the\ncommunication. See Dissenting Opinion at 7.\n          We have already discussed the limitation of such a\nprivilege to minors, (see note 23 supra) and know of no case\nwhere an adult child and his or her parent have been able to\ninvoke the privilege.\n\n26. We note that, although Judge Mansmann urges that we\nrecognize a privilege in the Virgin Islands case, the record in\nthe Virgin Islands case does not disclose the content of the\ncommunication at issue, and reveals no evidence that the son\nsought advice from his father -- even if one may infer that the\nson's communication was otherwise confidential in nature.\nTherefore, although the dissent advocates applying the privilege\nin the Virgin Islands case, Judge Mansmann fails to identify and\nthus satisfy her threshold qualification of the child seeking\n\n\n                                   41\n\fqualifications -- (1) a confidential communication, spoken or\n\nwritten, and (2) arising in the course of seeking parental\n\nadvice27 -- would have to be determined by a hearing - a mini-\n\ntrial - which would have the effect of destroying the\n\nconfidential nature of the communication (since the communication\n\nwould have to be divulged so that the district court could\n\ndetermine its precise nature).   It would also endow the district\n\ncourt with virtually unlimited discretion in granting or denying\n\nthe privilege (since the dissent provides little guidance to the\n\ndistrict court for making such a determination).   The exercise of\n\nthis discretion would undermine the very essence of a privilege\n\nthat \"the participants in the confidential conversation\" can\n\npredict \"with some degree of certainty\" that their conversation\n\nwill be protected.   See Jaffee v. Redmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118042\"><a href=\"/opinion/118042/jaffee-v-redmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1923</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1932\n\n(1996).\n\n          Thirdly, the crafting of the privilege as a jointly-\n\nheld privilege (by both parent and child) undermines the\n\ndissent's goal of encouraging a child to seek the advice of a\n\nparent and protecting the parent-child relationship.    The entire\n\nthrust of the dissent's opinion is that a child should feel\n\nconfident, in communicating with a parent to seek advice and\n(..continued)\nadvice from a parent -- a requirement that she identifies as\nessential for such a privilege.\n\n27. As the dissent frames the privilege, if a child divulges to\nhis parent that he is the Unabomber, a sex offender or an abuser\nof drugs, and does so without seeking guidance or advice, the\nprivilege would be unavailable.\n\n\n\n                                   42\n\fguidance, that the communication will remain inviolate.      However,\n\nthe dissent, then straddling the fence, also argues that the\n\nparent can choose to violate such a confidence and report a\n\nconfidential communication to others (presumably the authorities)\n\nin the interest of parental judgment.     See Dissenting Opinion at\n\n8 n.6.   We know of no privilege that can operate in such a two-\n\nway fashion and still remain effective.\n\n           The few observations made above do no more than\n\nhighlight the stark difference between the dissent's view of the\n\npublic good which subordinates the government's interest in\n\ndisclosure to a parent-child privilege, and the position we have\n\ntaken which recognizes justice and disclosure as the predominant\n\nprinciples for ascertaining truth.    See Trammel v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1980).\n\n           Finally, we observe that implicit in the various\n\ndiscussions by courts (both federal and state) of the parent-\n\nchild privilege is the fact that the \"strong and trusting parent-\n\nchild relationships\" which the dissent would preserve, see\n\nDissenting Opinion at 2, have existed throughout the years\n\nwithout the concomitant existence of a privilege protecting that\n\nrelationship.\n\n\n\n\n                                     43\n\f                                 V.\n\n          In short, if a new privilege is deemed worthy of\n\nrecognition, the wiser course in our opinion is to leave the\n\nadoption of such a privilege to Congress.\n\n\n          Although we are not reluctant to chart a new legal\n\ncourse, such an action should not be premised upon unsound legal\n\nprinciples or emotion.   The instant appeals furnish us with\n\nneither reason, nor analysis, nor a basis upon which to fashion\n\nsuch a privilege.\n\n          All that we have been told by the appellants and by the\n\ndissent is:   we should look to the healthy, psychological\n\ndevelopment of children; and that compelling the testimony of a\n\nparent is repugnant and indecent; that it is more important that\n\na child communicate with a parent than it is to compel a parent's\n\ntestimony; and that the preservation of the family and the\n\nprotection of a strong and trusting parent-child relationship\n\ntrumps all other interests.    These conclusions, as well as the\n\ncriteria which the dissent would require as to the nature of the\n\ncommunications and whether they were imparted in an effort to\n\nseek advice and counseling, cannot be satisfied without the\n\nbenefit of evidence, expert testimony, hearings or recognized\n\nauthority.    If a new privilege were to be engraved in the\n\nconcrete of our jurisprudence as the dissent argues, then it\n\nshould be framed so that its contours are clear and unambiguous,\n\nand it should be capable of being applied precisely, without the\n\n\n\n                                      44\n\fneed for multiple pretrial hearings, in addition to the\n\nprivilege's existence being known to the participants.    Sympathy\n\nalone cannot justify the creation of a new and unprecedented\n\nprivilege which does not meet the standards set by Congress, the\n\nSupreme Court and this court.\n\n          Accordingly, we will affirm the district court's order\n\nof June 19, 1995, which denied the father's motion to quash the\n\ngrand jury subpoena in the Virgin Islands case (95-7354).   We\n\nwill also affirm the district court's order of September 10, 1996\n\nin the Delaware cases (96-7529 and 96-7530), denying the joint\n\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena and rejecting appellants'\n\nclaims concerning the Schofield affidavit and in camera review.\n\n\n\nIN RE GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS (IMPOUNDED), No. 95-7354\n\nIn Re Grand Jury -- John Doe I, John Doe, II, Nos. 96-7530 and\n\n96-7259\n\n\n\nMANSMANN, J., concurring and dissenting.\n\n     I write separately because I am convinced that the\n\ntestimonial privilege issue raised by the Virgin Islands appeal\n\nis substantially different from that presented in the Delaware\n\nappeals28 and should be resolved in favor of the targeted son.\n28.       In the Virgin Islands appeal, a father has been\nsubpoenaed to testify regarding communications made to him by his\nteenaged son. In the Delaware appeals, on the other hand, a\nteenaged daughter has been subpoenaed to give testimony, based on\nher own knowledge, which could implicate her father in a crime;\nconfidential communications between parent and child are not\n\n\n                                  45\n\fThe Virgin Islands appeal, which challenges the denial of a\n\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena, requires that we confront\n\nan issue of first impression in our circuit:   should we make\n\navailable to a parent and child an evidentiary privilege which\n\ncould be invoked to prevent compelling that parent to testify\n\nregarding confidential communications made to the parent by his\n\nchild in the course of seeking parental advice and guidance?29\n\nIt appears that this precise question is one of first impression\n\nin the federal courts.\n\n     Because I conclude that the public good at issue, the\n\nprotection of strong and trusting parent-child relationships,\n\noutweighs the government's interest in disclosure, I would\n\nexercise the authority granted to the federal courts by Congress\n\nunder Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and would\n\nrecognize a limited privilege.   Accordingly, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n\n\n(..continued)\nalleged in the Delaware appeals. As I will explain, the\nprivilege question to be resolved in the Virgin Islands appeal\nfocuses on the confidential communication made by a child in the\ncourse of seeking parental advice. Consequently, it is more\nnarrow and more compelling than that presented in the Delaware\nappeals.\n\n29.       The majority contends that the record in the Virgin\nIslands matter \"reveals no evidence that the son sought advice\nfrom his father.\" (Typescript at 40 n.25.) This is incorrect.\nIn the Motion to Quash filed by the son, the son refers to the\nfact that he \"spoke privately with his father, seeking his\nfather's counsel about the matters which are the subject of the\nGrand Jury's investigation.\"\n\n\n\n                                   46\n\f                                   I.\n\n      This case, unlike most which we consider, does not require\n\nthat we apply the law as it exists with respect to testimonial\n\nprivilege.    Instead, we are asked to determine what the law in\n\nthis area ought to be.      While most courts have declined to\n\nrecognize a parent-child testimonial privilege, they have done so\n\nin contexts far different from the one presented here.     I am\n\nconvinced that this is an appropriate case in which to recognize\n\nand set parameters for a limited privilege.      Doing so is critical\n\nto several important public policy interests such as the\n\n\"protection of strong and trusting parent-child relationships and\n\nthe preservation of the sanctity of the family. . . .\"\n\nAppellant's Brief at 8.     The recognition of a parent-child\n\nprivilege is essential to \"the healthy psychological development\n\nof children and to the development of society as a whole\";\n\ncompelling a parent to testify adversely to a child is\n\n\"`repugnant to social sensibilities' and contrary to a democratic\n\nview of decency.\"    Wendy Meredith Watts, The Parent-Child\n\nPrivilege:    Hardly a New or Revolutionary Concept, 28 Wm. & Mary\n\nL.

I am convinced that the public good\n\nderived from a child's ability to communicate openly with and to\n\nseek guidance from his or her parents is of sufficient magnitude\n\nto transcend the judicial system's interest in compelled parental\n\ntestimony.32   Recognizing that \"our authority is narrow in scope\n\n32.       In addition to the balancing test laid out in Trammel,\nDean Wigmore has suggested a four-part test for determining\nwhether or not a particular testimonial privilege should be\nrecognized. In order for a privilege to obtain: (1) the\ncommunications must originate in a confidence that they will not\nbe disclosed; (2) this element of confidentiality must be\nessential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the\nrelation between the parties; (3) the relation must be one which,\nin the opinion of society, ought to be sedulously fostered; and\n(4) the injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure\nof the communication must be greater than the benefit thereby\ngained for the correct disposal of litigation. 8 John Henry\nWigmore, Evidence § 2285 (J.

I part\ncompany with the majority in the application of this test and am\nconvinced that the factors analyzed under the Rule 501 balancing\ntest are sufficient to satisfy the Wigmore test as well. The\nfirst condition of the Wigmore test is satisfied in that the\nparent-child relationship is one which naturally gives rise to\nconfidential communication. Second, confidentiality underlies\nthe parent child relationship; mutual trust encourages children\nto consult parents for guidance with the expectation that the\nparent will, in appropriate circumstances, honor the\nconfidentiality of those statements. Third, the family unit is\nthe building block of our society and the parent-child\nrelationship is at the core of that family unit.

Although this case might have been more\n\ncompelling had the son been a minor at the time of his statements\n\nto his father, I would not adopt a bright-line rule applicable\n\nonly to those who have not reached legal majority.    In order to\n\nadvance the policy interests which the targeted son articulated,\n\nI would prefer to leave the particular factors to be considered\n\nin determining application of the privilege to development on a\n\ncase-by-case basis.   I expect that these factors would include\n\nsuch variables as age, maturity, whether or not the child resides\n\nwith the parents, and the precise nature of the communications\n\nfor which the privilege is claimed.     The privilege would apply to\n\nsituations in which it is invoked by both parent and child; this\n\ncase does not require that we confront applicability of the\n\nprivilege where it is invoked by the parent or the child alone.\n\n     The goal in recognizing this limited privilege would not be\n\nto guarantee confidentiality per se but to shield parent-child\n\nrelationships from the devastating effects likely to be\n(..continued)\nthe damage resulting from compelling a parent to testify against\nhis child, in most if not all cases, outweighs the benefit\nassociated with correct disposal of the litigation.\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\fassociated with compelled testimony.    As one commentator has\n\nwritten:\n[T]o conceive of . . . privileges merely as exclusionary\n     rules, is to start out on the wrong road and, except by\n     happy accident, to reach the wrong destination. They\n     are, or rather by chance of litigation may become,\n     exclusionary rules; but this is incidental and\n     secondary. Primarily they are a right to be let alone,\n     a right to unfettered freedom, in certain narrowly\n     prescribed relationships, from the state's coercive or\n     supervisory powers. . . .\n\n\nLouisell, Confidentiality, Conformity, and Confusions:\n\nPrivileges in Federal Court Today, 31 Tul. L. Rev. 101, 110-11\n\n(1956).   An effective parent-child relationship is one deserving\n\nof protection.   It rests upon a relationship of mutual trust\n\nwhere the child has the right to expect that the parent will act\n\nin accordance with the child's best interest.33   If the state is\n\npermitted to interfere in that relationship by compelling parents\n\nto divulge information conveyed to them in confidence by their\n\nchildren, mutual trust, and ultimately the family, are\n\nthreatened.\n\n33.       While it is true, as the majority says, that few\nchildren are likely to be aware of a privilege per se, there is,\nin any event, a certain expectation that this information will\nnot be disclosed.\n\n          As the majority points out, there may be circumstances\nin which a parent, having heard communications from a child,\ndecides that it is in the child's best interest that those\ncommunications be divulged. The privilege which I advocate would\nnot interfere with that parental judgment. Presumably, if the\nparent is indeed acting in the child's best interest, disclosure\nwill not ultimately threaten the family relationship which I seek\nto protect. Furthermore, if the parent is willing to disclose\ninformation which may harm the child, the relationship is already\nbeyond the need for protection.\n\n\n\n                                   53\n\f     While I am aware that the availability of even this limited\n\nparent-child privilege may, in some rare circumstances,\n\ncomplicate a criminal fact-finding proceeding, I am convinced\n\nthat the risk is one well worth bearing.    \"[T]o reach the truth\n\nat the cost of the parent-child relationship would be to win the\n\nbattle and lose the war.\"   Wendy Meredith Watts, The Parent-Child\n\nPrivileges:    Hardly a New or Revolutionary Concept, 28 Wm. & Mary\n\nL.

Some commentators have sought to analogize the parent-\nchild privilege to the more widely recognized professional\ntestimonial privileges such as that between attorney and client,\npriest and penitent, and physician and patient:\n\nThe parent-child relationship is analogous to the privileged\n     professional relationships in many respects. As the\n     professional exercises his skill in the delicate\n     relationship with his client, the parent plays a unique\n     and sensitive role in the life of his \"client,\" the\n     child. In fulfilling this role, the parent must assume\n     many of the same responsibilities as professionals.\n     The parent, for example, often must serve as the\n     child's legal advisor, spiritual counselor, and\n     physical and emotional health expert. The necessity\n     for confidentiality is comparable to that within the\n     professional relationships.

The\n\ncourt in Sanders wrote that cases in which the parent-child\n\nprivilege has been upheld have\nrelied heavily upon conjecture that a family member who is\n     forced to testify against her will would face the\n     unpleasant choice of aiding the criminal conviction of\n     a loved one, perjuring herself on the stand, or risking\n     a citation for contempt of court for refusing to\n     testify and the belief that the harshness of this\n     choice has the effect of undermining the family\n     relationship. Such a fear is without foundation where,\n     as in this case, the witness who is a family member\n     volunteers her testimony. The voluntariness of the act\n     is strong evidence that the choice the witness faced\n     was an easy one for her to make.\n\n\n\n\n                                III.\n\n     While there is a substantial body of authority in which\n\ncourts have declined to recognize a parent-child privilege, none\n\nof the cases addresses under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence the issue of a parent's compelled testimony with respect\n\nto confidential advice-seeking statements made to the parent by\n43.

This case is also distinguishable from the only two\nfederal decisions to have recognized some form of parent-child\nprivilege. In In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Greenberg), 11 Fed.\nR. Evid. Serv. (Callaghan) 579 (D. Conn. 1982), a mother asserted\na testimonial privilege to prevent being compelled to testify\nbefore a grand jury against her adult daughter. The privilege\nasserted was based on the mother's First Amendment free exercise\nclaim. Specifically, the mother claimed that as a conservative\nJew, she could not testify against her daughter without violating\na basic tenet of her religion which forbids a parent to testify\nagainst a child. The district court recognized a parent-child\nprivilege grounded in the First Amendment, holding that\n\"requiring Mrs. Greenberg to testify would interfere with her\nfree exercise of religion, though only to the extent that her\nanswers would incriminate her daughter.\" Id. at 582. The court\ndeclined to recognize a common-law privilege protecting\nconfidential parent-child communications in general, however,\nnoting that although compelled disclosure of non-incriminating\nconfidences might damage the relationship between the mother and\nher daughter, the harm would be less severe than if an\nunemancipated minor were involved. Id. at 586-87.\n\n           In In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Agosto), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572791\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572791/in-re-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In granting the son's motion, the\ncourt recognized an expansive common-law testimonial privilege,\nholding that the government's interest in presenting all relevant\nevidence does not outweigh \"an individual's right of privacy in\nhis communications within the family unit, nor does it outweigh\nthe family's interest in its integrity and inviolability.\" Id.\nat 1325. The court supported its decision in part by reference\nto constitutional law affording protection for the family right\nof privacy, id. at 1310, and the \"expansive posture taken by\nCongress in enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 501.\" Id. at 1325.\n While I am in accord with the Agosto court with respect to the\nimportance of parent-child relationships, I am not prepared to\nsay that I would reach a similar result on similar facts. The\ncase presented in Agosto, involving as it did an adult child's\ntestimony against a parent, is far less compelling than the case\nnow before us. Furthermore, I would decline to adopt a broad\nrule of privilege and, recognizing the need for caution and\nrestraint, have narrowly drawn the privilege which I would\nrecognize.\n\n\n\n                                   63\n\fnarrowly circumscribed parent-child privilege.    The interests\n\ninvolved in protecting the communications at issue here are far\n\nstronger than those involved in previous cases.    Consequently,\n\nthe result which I would reach is not as radical as it might\n\ninitially appear.\n\n\n\n                              IV.\n\n     I am convinced that the public good to be derived from a\n\ncircumscribed parent-child testimonial privilege outweighs the\n\njudicial system's interest in compelled parental testimony.      I\n\nwould, therefore, recognize a privilege which could be invoked by\n\na parent and child together to bar compelled testimony concerning\n\nconfidential communications made to that parent by his child in\n\nthe course of seeking parental advice and guidance.    I would\n\nreverse the district court's order in the Virgin Islands matter\n\ndenying the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena.\n\n\n\n\n                                    64\n\f                                  V.\n\n        Although I am content with the disposition of the privilege\n\nissue in the Delaware matters, I must comment on what is, to me,\n\na disturbing aspect of these appeals.\n\n        Appellants in the Delaware cases attack the propriety of the\n\nsubpoenas issued to the minor, arguing that the government failed\n\nto make the minimum disclosure of the grand jury's purpose\n\nrequired by our decisions in In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n(Schofield I), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1973), and In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings (Schofield II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"323879\"><a href=\"/opinion/323879/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-appeal-of-jacqueline-schofield/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 966 (3d Cir. 1975).\n\nThese cases establish that a party seeking enforcement of a grand\n\njury proceeding is required to make\na minimum showing by affidavit . . . that each item sought\n     was (1) relevant to an investigation, (2) properly\n     within the grand jury's jurisdiction, and (3) not\n     sought primarily for another purpose.\n\n\n507 F.2d at 966.    While the information supplied in the affidavit\n\nmay be \"scant,\" it must give \"the trial judge some basis for\n\ndetermining that the three-pronged test . . . has[s] been met.\"\n\nId. at 967.\n\n     It would be an overstatement to characterize the information\n\ncontained in the affidavit submitted here as even \"scant\" as the\n\naffidavit contains nothing at all beyond a mere recitation of the\n\nSchofield requirements.     Our Schofield decisions, if they mean\n\nanything at all, require something, albeit a small something,\n\nmore.\n\n\n\n\n                                       65\n\f     My concern over erosion of the Schofield requirements is\n\nobviated in this case by the further proceedings conducted by the\n\ndistrict court to ensure the need for the minor daughter's\n\ntestimony.   Were it not for these further proceedings, I am\n\nconvinced that reliance on the affidavit as it was written would\n\nhave been error.\n\n\n\n\n                                   66\n\f67\n\f</pre>",
