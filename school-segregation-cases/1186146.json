At issue is whether federal water rights\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fwere impliedly reserved on lands granted by the United States\n\ngovernment     to     the   State    of   Arizona     to   support   education   and\n\nother public institutions (“State Trust Lands”).                       We accepted\n\nreview and now affirm the superior court’s ruling that there are\n\nno implied federal reserved water rights for State Trust Lands.\n\n                            I.   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2           In 1787, the federal government established a policy\n\nto support public schools in new territories.                        See Northwest\n\nOrdinance, Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50, 51-52 n.(a)\n\n(affirming the 1787 Act of the Continental Congress).                       Congress\n\nfurthered this policy by granting land from the public domain to\n\nnew territories and states to be used for educational purposes.\n\nSee Lassen v. Arizona ex rel. Ariz. Highway Dep’t, 385 U.S. 458,\n\n460 (1967).      When Congress established the New Mexico Territory,\n\nwhich included the present State of Arizona, it “reserved for\n\nthe   purpose       of   being   applied       to   schools”   township     sections\n\nsixteen and thirty-six.             Act of Sept. 9, 1850, ch. 49, § 15, 9\n\nStat.   446,    452      (“Organic    Act”).        Four   years   later,   Congress\n\n“reserved for the establishment of a University” a grant of land\n\nequal to two townships.             Act of July 22, 1854, ch. 103, § 6, 10\n\nStat. 308, 309.\n\n¶3           Congress gave these land grants to Arizona when it\n\nseparated the Arizona Territory from the New Mexico Territory.\n\nAct of Feb. 24, 1863, ch. 56, 12 Stat. 664, 665.                            In 1881,\n\n\n                                           4\n\fCongress provided the Arizona Territory with another grant of\n\nseventy-two sections of land, “withdrawn from sale,” to support\n\na university.            Act of Feb. 18, 1881, ch. 61, 21 Stat. 326.\n\n¶4          In       1910,        Congress      passed     the       Arizona—New       Mexico\n\nEnabling Act (“Enabling Act”), which set forth the requirements\n\nfor the two territories to become states.                        Act of June 20, 1910,\n\nch. 310, 36 Stat. 557.                    The Enabling Act confirmed the prior\n\nland   grants       and    also     granted     sections       two    and    thirty-two     in\n\nevery township to support the common schools.                                Id. § 24, 36\n\nStat. at 572.             It also provided “bulk” grants consisting of a\n\nset    number       of    acres     for    other     specific        purposes,      including\n\nuniversities; government buildings; prisons; insane asylums; a\n\nschool    for       the    deaf     and    blind;     normal     schools;         charitable,\n\npenal,    and       reform    institutions;           agricultural          and    mechanical\n\ncolleges;       a    school       of   mines;       military     institutes;         and   the\n\npayment of certain bonds.                 Id. § 25, 36 Stat. at 573.\n\n¶5          In some instances, the particular sections granted to\n\nsupport     common         schools        (“section-in-place          grants”)      were    no\n\nlonger    available          when      the    townships     were       finally       surveyed\n\nbecause those sections had been settled, reserved for Indian\n\ntribes, or otherwise reserved or disposed of under federal law.\n\nSee Report of the State Land Commission of Arizona 16, 41-42, 67\n\n(1912-1914) [hereinafter Land Comm’n Report].                           To indemnify the\n\nstate for these preempted sections, Congress appropriated lands\n\n\n                                                5\n\fof like quantity (“indemnity-in-lieu selections”) and authorized\n\nthe state to select and receive such lands.                               Act of Feb. 28,\n\n1891, ch. 384, 26 Stat. 796, 796-97; Act of Feb. 26, 1859, ch.\n\n58, 11 Stat. 385.                The state acquired a fee interest in the\n\nState Trust Lands upon completion of a survey for section-in-\n\nplace grants, and upon selection and approval by the Secretary\n\nof the Interior (“Secretary”) for the bulk-grant and indemnity-\n\nin-lieu selections.              Enabling Act, §§ 24, 29, 36 Stat. at 572-\n\n74, 575-76; see Andrus v. Utah (Andrus), 446 U.S. 500, 506-07\n\n(1980); Land Comm’n Report at 13-14.\n\n¶6              The    Enabling     Act   required          Arizona       to   hold    granted\n\nlands in trust:\n\n       [A]ll lands hereby granted, including those which,\n       having been heretofore granted to the said Territory,\n       are hereby expressly transferred and confirmed to the\n       said State, shall be by the said State held in trust,\n       to be disposed of in whole or in part only in manner\n       as herein provided and for the several objects\n       specified in the respective granting and confirmatory\n       provisions, and that the natural products and money\n       proceeds of any of said lands shall be subject to the\n       same trusts as the lands producing the same.\n\n§    28,   36    Stat.    at     574.     The       Act    set    forth    lease      and   sale\n\nrequirements that may be enforced by the federal government, the\n\nstate, or any Arizona citizen.                      Id. § 28, 36 Stat. at 574-75.\n\nThe    state,         however,     was    given           exclusive       control      of   the\n\nbeneficiary schools, colleges, and universities subject to the\n\ncondition       that     trust    proceeds      support          only   non-sectarian       and\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fnon-denominational institutions.                  Id. § 26, 36 Stat. at 573-74.\n\n¶7           At    statehood,         Arizona      consented     to     the     terms    and\n\nconditions of the Enabling Act, Ariz. Const. art. 10, § 1, art.\n\n20, ¶ 12, and eventually received almost eleven million acres of\n\nState     Trust    Lands       for    the   benefit     of     public        institutions,\n\nLassen,    385     U.S.    at    460.       Congress    expected        the     grants    to\n\nproduce a fund through sale and use of the lands.                             Lassen, 385\n\nU.S. at 463.\n\n¶8           The    state       currently    manages     more     than        9.2   million\n\nacres of State Trust Lands, with approximately 1.4 million acres\n\nin the Little Colorado River Basin and approximately 5.1 million\n\nacres in the Gila River Basin.                   Although adjudication of claims\n\nfor waters in those two river systems continues, it is well\n\nknown that “the amount of surface water available [in Arizona]\n\nis   insufficient         to    satisfy     all     needs.”       United       States     v.\n\nSuperior Court, 144 Ariz. 265, 270, 697 P.2d 658, 663 (1985).\n\n                           II.       PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶9           These    consolidated          cases     originated        in    proceedings\n\ninitiated by water rights claimants who filed with the Arizona\n\nState Land Department (ASLD) in the 1970s, under then-existing\n\nstatutory    adjudication            procedures.       See    A.R.S.     §§     45-231   to\n\n-245, repealed by 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 139, § 38, eff.\n\nApr. 24, 1979.            Much has occurred since then.                  Now, a single\n\nwater judge presides over both adjudications.                           Ariz. Sup. Ct.\n\n\n                                             7\n\fOrder (Jan. 17, 2002); Ariz. Sup. Ct. Order (Dec. 19, 2000).                      A\n\nspecial    master     initially    conducts    hearings     and    files    reports\n\nwith the court.         A.R.S. § 45-257 (2012).             To date, more than\n\n14,000 and 82,000 claims have been made in the Little Colorado\n\nand Gila River adjudications respectively.1\n\n¶10         The State moved for partial summary judgment in the\n\nLittle     Colorado    and      Gila   River   adjudications        to     recognize\n\nfederal reserved water rights for State Trust Lands.2                          After\n\nbriefing and oral argument, the special master concluded that\n\nfederal reserved water rights do not apply to such lands.                        He\n\nsubmitted    a   report    to    the   superior    court,   which    adopted    the\n\nmaster’s    findings      and    conclusions      that   support     the    court’s\n\nruling that the reserved water rights doctrine is inapplicable\n\nto State Trust Lands.            The court therefore denied the State’s\n\n\n1\n     The adjudications’ histories are lengthy and complex.    For\nadditional factual and procedural background, see Arizona v. San\nCarlos Apache Tribe, 463 U.S. 545, 557–59 (1983); In re Rights\nto the Use of the Gila River (Gila I), 171 Ariz. 230, 232–33,\n830 P.2d 442, 444–45 (1992); Superior Court, 144 Ariz. at 269–\n71, 697 P.2d at 662–64; John E. Thorson et al., Dividing Western\nWaters: A Century of Adjudicating Rivers and Streams, Part II,\n9 U. Denv. Water L. Rev. 299 (2006) (providing comprehensive\nhistory of western water adjudications); and Joseph M. Feller,\nThe Adjudication That Ate Arizona Water Law, 49 Ariz. L. Rev.\n405, 417-22 (2007) (reviewing litigation within Gila River\nadjudication and Silver Creek contest within Little Colorado\nadjudication).

Standard of review\n\n¶12             Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine\n\nissue    of     material      fact      and    the    moving    party   is    entitled        to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.                          Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(c).                 On\n\nappeal, we view the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom\n\nin the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\n\nAndrews v.

Applicable rule of construction\n\n¶13          To determine whether the federal reserved water rights\n\ndoctrine applies, we must first construe the federal legislation\n\ngranting    trust   land    to    Arizona.       The    State    argues   that   the\n\nsuperior court erred in narrowly construing the Organic Act and\n\nEnabling    Act   grants.        We   disagree.        Federal   property   grants\n\ngenerally should be interpreted narrowly because “nothing passes\n\nby mere implication.”            Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, 200\n\nU.S. 22, 33-34 (1906); cf. Kadish v. Ariz. State Land Dep’t, 155\n\nAriz.     484,    495,   747     P.2d    1183,    1194     (1987)    (recognizing\n\nprinciple of construing “federal land grants in favor of the\n\n[granting] government”), aff’d sub nom. ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,\n\n490 U.S. 605 (1989).\n\n¶14          Under a limited exception to that general rule, courts\n\nmay liberally construe federal legislation “designed to aid the\n\ncommon schools of states.”              Wyoming v. United States, 255 U.S.\n\n489, 508 (1921).          For purposes of determining whether a land\n\ngrant includes implied rights, this exception applies only when\n\nnarrow     construction     of    the    grant    would    result    in   complete\n\nfailure of the grant’s purpose or render the land worthless.\n\nSee Lyon v. Gila River Indian Cmty., 626 F.3d 1059, 1072-73 (9th\n\nCir. 2010); Utah v. Andrus (Utah Right-of-Access Case), 486 F.\n\nSupp. 995, 1002 (D. Utah 1979); cf. Andrus, 446 U.S. at 520\n\n\n                                         10\n\f(reversing      decision    in    which    lower   court    liberally    construed\n\nfederal legislation regarding indemnity-in-lieu selection).\n\n¶15          This case raises no such concerns.                 As noted above,\n\nsupra ¶ 7, the purpose of State Trust Lands is to produce a fund\n\nfrom sale and use of the lands to support common schools and\n\nother public institutions designated by Congress.                     Lassen, 385\n\nU.S. at 463; Lyon, 626 F.3d at 1073.                The State has not argued\n\nthat, without federal reserved water rights, the State Trust\n\nLands will become worthless or incapable of producing a fund to\n\nsupport    their    designated         beneficiaries.       Indeed,   State    Trust\n\nLands have without such rights produced revenue for a century.\n\nSee   ASLD-History,      http://www.land.state.az.us/history.htm;               Land\n\nComm’n Report at 56-64.\n\n¶16          We agree with other courts that have adopted a rule of\n\nnarrow     construction          for     federal   reserved      water       rights,\n\nrecognizing        the     doctrine’s       disruptive       effect     in     prior\n\nappropriation jurisdictions.

Federal reserved water rights doctrine\n\n¶17           Generally, water rights must be obtained under state\n\nlaw,   even    on     federal    lands.           Cal.   Or.    Power    Co.    v.      Beaver\n\nPortland Cement Co., 295 U.S. 142, 163-64 (1935).                              In Arizona,\n\ngroundwater     is     regulated       by    the    Arizona     Department         of   Water\n\nResources      and    governed     by       the    doctrine      of     reasonable       use.\n\nA.R.S. § 45-451 et seq. (2012).                    The right to use surface water\n\nand sub-flow is governed by the doctrine of prior appropriation,\n\n§§ 45-141, -251(7), meaning the first to divert water and put it\n\nto beneficial use has priority against later diverters, § 45-\n\n151.    See Ariz. Const. art. 17; In re the Gen.

Federal reserved water right holders can claim a\n\npriority      date     based      on    the        establishment        of     a     federal\n\nreservation regardless of whether the claimed water was actually\n\nput to use on that date.

Jesse,     744       P.2d    491,    493-94    (Colo.     1987)).\n\n“[T]he   quantity      of   a    federal          reserved     water    right     is   not\n\ndetermined by the amount of water put to beneficial use; rather,\n\nit is determined by the amount of water necessary to carry out\n\nthe primary purpose of the reservation.”                     Id.\n\n¶19          The United States Supreme Court first recognized the\n\ndoctrine of reserved water rights in Winters v. United States,\n\nconcluding that Congress had impliedly reserved rights to Milk\n\nRiver waters for the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation because\n\nthose water rights were necessary to sustain the reservation\n\ncommunity.     207 U.S. 564, 576-77 (1908).                   Reserved water rights\n\nhave since been recognized for non-Indian reservations as well.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. New Mexico, 438 U.S. 696, 718 (1978)\n\n(national forest); Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S. 128, 138\n\n(1976) (national monument); Arizona v.

United States, 438\n\nU.S. 645, 674 (1978).\n\n¶20          The Supreme Court further defined the parameters of\n\nthe reserved water rights doctrine in Cappaert, stating that\n\n“when the Federal Government withdraws its land from the public\n\ndomain   and   reserves     it    for    a    federal       purpose,”    it     impliedly\n\nreserves appurtenant water “to the extent needed to accomplish\n\nthe purpose of the reservation.”                     426 U.S. at 138.             In New\n\n\n                                             13\n\fMexico, the Supreme Court clarified that federal reserved water\n\nrights do not extend to a reservation’s secondary purposes.                               438\n\nU.S. at 702.\n\n¶21            To determine whether the federal government impliedly\n\nreserved water rights, the superior court must\n\n        [1] examine the documents reserving the land from the\n        public   domain   and    the  underlying   legislation\n        authorizing the reservation; [2] determine the precise\n        federal purposes to be served by such legislation;\n        [3] determine whether water is essential for the\n        primary purposes of the reservation; and finally\n        [4] determine the precise quantity of water — the\n        minimal need as set forth in Cappaert and New Mexico —\n        required for such purposes.\n\nIn re the Gen.

This analysis requires review of the pertinent\n\ndocuments       to     determine          whether     the    land     in    question      was\n\nwithdrawn      from     the    public      domain     and    reserved      for    a   federal\n\npurpose,       and,    if     so,    whether        Congress    intended         to   reserve\n\nappurtenant,          unappropriated         water     for     that     purpose.          See\n\nCappaert, 426 U.S. at 138-39.\n\nD.      Withdrawal and reservation for a federal purpose\n\n¶22            The State argues that the lands Congress granted in\n\ntrust    to    the     states       for    institutional       purposes      fall     into    a\n\n\n                                              14\n\fspecial    category      of    federal    reservation.        Under   the     State’s\n\ntheory, Congress reserved the trust land for the federal purpose\n\nof    supporting    specified      public      institutions    and    provided     for\n\nwithdrawal of those lands at the time of survey or, for bulk-\n\ngrant    and    indemnity-in-lieu        selections,    when    approved      by   the\n\nSecretary.\n\n¶23            In New Mexico Commissioner, the New Mexico Court of\n\nAppeals     addressed         whether    Congress    had   impliedly         reserved\n\nfederal water rights for New Mexico’s trust lands.                     200 P.3d at\n\n95-98.     That court concluded that the relevant language in our\n\nstates’ common Organic and Enabling Acts “did not sufficiently\n\nwithdraw or reserve lands to create implied federal reserved\n\nwater rights” and, therefore, did not satisfy “the threshold\n\nrequirements       of   demonstrating       the   existence”    of    such    rights.\n\nId. at 97.       Although the sections of the Enabling Act providing\n\nfor Arizona’s and New Mexico’s land grants are distinct, the\n\nlanguage and context of the separate sections are substantially\n\nsimilar for purposes of analyzing the State’s reserved water\n\nright claim here.             Compare §§ 6-12, 36 Stat. at 561-65 (New\n\nMexico), with §§ 24-30, 36 Stat. at 572-76 (Arizona).                        We agree\n\nwith the reasoning and conclusion in New Mexico Commissioner.\n\n¶24            The Enabling Act provides:\n\n        [I]n addition to sections sixteen and thirty-six,\n        heretofore reserved for the Territory of Arizona,\n        sections two and thirty-two in every township . . .\n\n\n                                          15\n\f       not otherwise appropriated at the date of the passage\n       of this Act are hereby granted to the State for the\n       support of common schools.\n\n§ 24, 36 Stat. at 572 (emphases added) (carrying forward the\n\ngrants of the Organic Act, § 15, 9 Stat. at 452, which also\n\n“reserved”     sections        sixteen       and        thirty-six).           The    term\n\n“withdraw” does not appear in any form within the Enabling Act,\n\nthough    it   was      used    in    the        1881       bulk     grant    to    support\n\nuniversities, 21 Stat. 326, see supra ¶ 3, and that grant was\n\nincorporated in the Enabling Act, § 24, 36 Stat. at 572.\n\n¶25          That Congress uses the word “withdraw” or “reserve” in\n\na statute granting land does not necessarily mean that the land\n\nis withdrawn or reserved for purposes of public land law.

See N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d\n\nat 96; Land Comm’n Report at 67.                         The State Trust Lands also\n\nwere not withdrawn after the Secretary approved the surveys or\n\nbulk-grant selections because, at that point, the lands were\n\nowned by the state or were subject to a claim by the Territory\n\nthat    would    vest     upon     statehood.             Andrus,    446     U.S.    at     523\n\n(recognizing       that       title    to    sections       vested     in     states       upon\n\nsurvey’s approval); Gonzales v. French, 164 U.S. 338, 344 (1896)\n\n(recognizing that, before statehood, territories could attach a\n\nclaim).    Additionally, the Enabling Act authorized the state to\n\nsell the Trust Land, in whole or in part, “to the highest and\n\nbest bidder at a public auction.”                  § 28, 36 Stat. at 574.\n\n¶28            Thus, after approval of a survey and selections, State\n\nTrust Lands were neither owned by the federal government nor\n\n\n                                              18\n\fwithheld from disposition.        See Kelly v. Allen, 49 F.2d 876, 878\n\n(9th Cir. 1931) (“[Arizona] is not holding [granted] land as an\n\ninstrumentality of the United States, but in its own right . . .\n\nfor the schools of the state.”).              No withdrawal occurred with\n\nrespect to State Trust Lands.\n\n¶29         Nor were those lands reserved for a federal purpose.\n\nA reservation dedicates land to a specific public use.                S. Utah\n\nWilderness Alliance, 425 F.3d at 785; Black’s Law Dictionary\n\n1031 (1st ed. 1891).           That use — the reservation’s purpose —\n\nmust be federal for the federal reserved water rights doctrine\n\nto apply.    Cappaert, 426 U.S. at 138.\n\n¶30         The State argues that the Trust Lands were granted to\n\nfund congressionally identified institutions, and they therefore\n\nwere reserved for a federal purpose, shown by the fact that\n\nCongress    established    a   trust   with   federal   enforcement    power.\n\nSee Lassen, 385 U.S. at 461-63 (providing that the purpose of\n\nland grants was to produce funds to support public institutions\n\nand noting that the federal government may enforce the grants’\n\nterms); Kadish, 155 Ariz. at 487, 747 P.2d at 1186 (providing\n\nthat the state is trustee of federally granted common school\n\ntrust land); Enabling Act, § 28, 36 Stat. at 5775 (authorizing\n\nthe federal government to enforce trust requirements).                We are\n\nnot persuaded.\n\n¶31         Support   of   the    common    schools   and   other   specified\n\n\n                                       19\n\finstitutions undoubtedly serves the public interest.                                It is not,\n\nhowever, a federal purpose.                   Cooper v. Roberts, 59 U.S. (18\n\nHow.) 173, 181-82 (1855) (“The trusts created by [common school\n\ngrants] relate to a subject certainly of universal interest, but\n\nof municipal concern.”); N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d at 97 (“Although\n\nwe do not deny that the support of common schools is a matter of\n\nnational interest, we cannot conclude that it is also a federal\n\npurpose    in    the       context    of    the    implied         federal     water    rights\n\ndoctrine.”);        cf.     United    States      v.        Lopez,    514    U.S.    549,    564\n\n(1995)     (recognizing           states’     power          to    regulate     education);\n\nPreiser v.

Indeed, “the schools, colleges, and universities\n\nprovided      for     in    this     Act    shall           forever    remain       under    the\n\nexclusive control of [Arizona].”                       Enabling Act, § 26, 36 Stat.\n\nat 573-74.\n\n¶33           Nor does the retained oversight indicate the federal\n\ngovernment’s        continued        ownership         of    the     trust   lands     or   its\n\n\n                                             20\n\fauthority to make policy decisions on how the lands are used.\n\nSee     N.M.

The\n\nEnabling Act provides only a limited federal power to intercede\n\nin the event State Trust Lands are abused.                                       See S. Rep.

Cf. Kelly, 49 F.2d\n\nat 878.      Again, that is not the case with respect to State Trust\n\nLands.\n\n¶35          Finally, we note that Congress knew how to reserve\n\nland   for    a   federal   purpose       and    effectively         did    so    in   the\n\nEnabling Act when it excluded from selection by the state any\n\nlands valuable for providing water power:\n\n       There is hereby reserved to the United States and\n       excepted from the operation of any and all grants made\n       or confirmed by this Act to said proposed State all\n       land actually or prospectively valuable for the\n       development of water powers . . . and no lands so\n       reserved and excepted shall be subject to any\n       disposition whatsoever.\n\n§ 28, 36 Stat. at 575 (emphases added); see United States v.\n\nErvien, 246 F. 277, 278 (8th Cir. 1917), aff’d, 251 U.S. 41\n\n(1919).       That   provision    preserved          the    land     for    use   by   the\n\nfederal      government     and    precluded          disposition,          unlike     the\n\nrelevant provisions here, which conveyed land to the state and\n\nallowed future sales and leases.                See Enabling Act, §§ 24-28, 36\n\nStat. at 572-74; supra ¶¶ 27-28.                The water power provision also\n\nconcerned     unique   land,      while        the   relevant        provisions        here\n\nconcerned random and uncertain lands.                  See id. § 29, 36 Stat. at\n\n575 (providing that bulk-grant and in-lieu selections must be\n\nfrom “unreserved, unappropriated, and nonmineral public lands”);\n\n\n                                          22\n\fAndrus, 446 U.S. at 523 (discussing section-in-place grants as\n\n“random     cross    section[s]          of    the     public       land”).       Thus,       if\n\nCongress    had     wanted       to    withdraw       and    reserve       for   a    federal\n\npurpose the lands it granted to the state, it could have done\n\nso.     See N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d at 97.\n\n¶36          For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the State\n\nTrust    Lands    were     not    withdrawn          and    reserved       for   a    federal\n\npurpose.      Thus,      these        lands    cannot       include    federal       reserved\n\nwater rights.\n\nE.      Congressional intent\n\n¶37          Even    had    the       State    Trust       Lands    been    withdrawn        and\n\nreserved, no evidence suggests that Congress intended to reserve\n\nwater    rights     on   those        lands.        The     State    contends        that    the\n\nfederal government’s relationship to the states is akin to its\n\nrelationship        to     the    Indian        tribes       and     posits      that       this\n\nrelationship compels a finding that Congress intended to reserve\n\nwater for State Trust Land development.                            We disagree.         Unlike\n\nreservations for the Indian tribes, land grants to the states\n\nare not the product of negotiated agreements or treaties.                                    See\n\nWinters, 207 U.S. at 575-76.                  Nor does the State cite authority\n\nfor resolving any ambiguities in state land grants “from the\n\nstandpoint of” the states.               See id. at 576; cf. United States v.\n\nWinans, 198 U.S. 371, 381 (1905) (indicating that a “treaty was\n\nnot a grant of rights to the Indians, but a grant of right from\n\n\n                                               23\n\fthem”).\n\n¶38          The    State     also    contends      that       Congress          intended    to\n\nreserve water rights because it knew of the region’s aridity and\n\nthe need for water to make productive use of the land.                                       To\n\nsupport     this     contention,       the       State        quotes       Senator       Daniel\n\nWebster’s observation that throughout the region, “there is one\n\nfatal want of water.”            Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 1st Sess. 860\n\n(1850).     But Senator Webster was speaking about Texas boundaries\n\nas he advocated for establishing a territorial border to prevent\n\nTexas     from     claiming    land    that        could       help        the   New     Mexico\n\nTerritory      secure   the    population         needed       to    achieve        statehood.\n\nId.     Notably, the goal of increasing the Territory’s population\n\nwould also have been supported by ensuring that the region’s\n\nscarce    water     supply    was     obtainable         by    settlers          rather    than\n\nreserved.\n\n¶39          To enhance the value of its land grant to Arizona, the\n\nfederal     government       increased       the    number          of     school      section-\n\nin−place grants from two to four sections per township.                                     See\n\nEnabling Act, § 24, 36 Stat. at 572; N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d at\n\n98-99; Lassen, 385 U.S. at 463 n.7; cf. H.R. Rep. No. 52-737, at\n\n10    (1892)     (providing,     in    an        unenacted          bill     preceding      the\n\nEnabling Act, that granting Arizona four sections per township\n\nwould not “more than equal in value the land aid Congress has\n\ngiven the other States” that received fewer sections).                                 Thus, we\n\n\n                                            24\n\fconclude that Congress intended to compensate for the relatively\n\nlow value of land granted to Arizona by augmenting the amount of\n\nland granted, not by reserving federal water rights for those\n\nlands.    See N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d at 98-99.\n\n                              IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n¶40         For the reasons stated above, we find no withdrawal,\n\nno    reservation   for   a   federal    purpose,   and   no   congressional\n\nintent to reserve water rights for the State Trust Lands.5                We\n\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the superior court.\n\n\n\n                              _____________________________________\n                              A.

At issue is whether federal water rights\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fwere impliedly reserved on lands granted by the United States\n\ngovernment     to     the   State    of   Arizona     to   support   education   and\n\nother public institutions (“State Trust Lands”).                       We accepted\n\nreview and now affirm the superior court’s ruling that there are\n\nno implied federal reserved water rights for State Trust Lands.\n\n                            I.   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2           In 1787, the federal government established a policy\n\nto support public schools in new territories.                        See Northwest\n\nOrdinance, Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50, 51-52 n.(a)\n\n(affirming the 1787 Act of the Continental Congress).                       Congress\n\nfurthered this policy by granting land from the public domain to\n\nnew territories and states to be used for educational purposes.\n\nSee Lassen v. Arizona ex rel. Ariz. Highway Dep’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107333\"><a href=\"/opinion/107333/lassen-v-arizona-ex-rel-arizona-highway-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n460 (1967).      When Congress established the New Mexico Territory,\n\nwhich included the present State of Arizona, it “reserved for\n\nthe   purpose       of   being   applied       to   schools”   township     sections\n\nsixteen and thirty-six.             Act of Sept. 9, 1850, ch. 49, § 15, 9\n\nStat.   446,    452      (“Organic    Act”).        Four   years   later,   Congress\n\n“reserved for the establishment of a University” a grant of land\n\nequal to two townships.             Act of July 22, 1854, ch. 103, § 6, 10\n\nStat. 308, 309.\n\n¶3           Congress gave these land grants to Arizona when it\n\nseparated the Arizona Territory from the New Mexico Territory.\n\nAct of Feb. 24, 1863, ch. 56, 12 Stat. 664, 665.                            In 1881,\n\n\n                                           4\n\fCongress provided the Arizona Territory with another grant of\n\nseventy-two sections of land, “withdrawn from sale,” to support\n\na university.            Act of Feb. 18, 1881, ch. 61, 21 Stat. 326.\n\n¶4          In       1910,        Congress      passed     the       Arizona—New       Mexico\n\nEnabling Act (“Enabling Act”), which set forth the requirements\n\nfor the two territories to become states.                        Act of June 20, 1910,\n\nch. 310, 36 Stat. 557.                    The Enabling Act confirmed the prior\n\nland   grants       and    also     granted     sections       two    and    thirty-two     in\n\nevery township to support the common schools.                                Id. § 24, 36\n\nStat. at 572.             It also provided “bulk” grants consisting of a\n\nset    number       of    acres     for    other     specific        purposes,      including\n\nuniversities; government buildings; prisons; insane asylums; a\n\nschool    for       the    deaf     and    blind;     normal     schools;         charitable,\n\npenal,    and       reform    institutions;           agricultural          and    mechanical\n\ncolleges;       a    school       of   mines;       military     institutes;         and   the\n\npayment of certain bonds.                 Id. § 25, 36 Stat. at 573.\n\n¶5          In some instances, the particular sections granted to\n\nsupport     common         schools        (“section-in-place          grants”)      were    no\n\nlonger    available          when      the    townships     were       finally       surveyed\n\nbecause those sections had been settled, reserved for Indian\n\ntribes, or otherwise reserved or disposed of under federal law.\n\nSee Report of the State Land Commission of Arizona 16, 41-42, 67\n\n(1912-1914) [hereinafter Land Comm’n Report].                           To indemnify the\n\nstate for these preempted sections, Congress appropriated lands\n\n\n                                                5\n\fof like quantity (“indemnity-in-lieu selections”) and authorized\n\nthe state to select and receive such lands.                               Act of Feb. 28,\n\n1891, ch. 384, 26 Stat. 796, 796-97; Act of Feb. 26, 1859, ch.\n\n58, 11 Stat. 385.                The state acquired a fee interest in the\n\nState Trust Lands upon completion of a survey for section-in-\n\nplace grants, and upon selection and approval by the Secretary\n\nof the Interior (“Secretary”) for the bulk-grant and indemnity-\n\nin-lieu selections.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶9           These    consolidated          cases     originated        in    proceedings\n\ninitiated by water rights claimants who filed with the Arizona\n\nState Land Department (ASLD) in the 1970s, under then-existing\n\nstatutory    adjudication            procedures.       See    A.R.S.     §§     45-231   to\n\n-245, repealed by 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 139, § 38, eff.\n\nApr. 24, 1979.            Much has occurred since then.                  Now, a single\n\nwater judge presides over both adjudications.                           Ariz. Sup. Ct.\n\n\n                                             7\n\fOrder (Jan. 17, 2002); Ariz. Sup. Ct. Order (Dec. 19, 2000).                      A\n\nspecial    master     initially    conducts    hearings     and    files    reports\n\nwith the court.         A.R.S. § 45-257 (2012).             To date, more than\n\n14,000 and 82,000 claims have been made in the Little Colorado\n\nand Gila River adjudications respectively.1\n\n¶10         The State moved for partial summary judgment in the\n\nLittle     Colorado    and      Gila   River   adjudications        to     recognize\n\nfederal reserved water rights for State Trust Lands.2                          After\n\nbriefing and oral argument, the special master concluded that\n\nfederal reserved water rights do not apply to such lands.                        He\n\nsubmitted    a   report    to    the   superior    court,   which    adopted    the\n\nmaster’s    findings      and    conclusions      that   support     the    court’s\n\nruling that the reserved water rights doctrine is inapplicable\n\nto State Trust Lands.

That court concluded that the relevant language in our\n\nstates’ common Organic and Enabling Acts “did not sufficiently\n\nwithdraw or reserve lands to create implied federal reserved\n\nwater rights” and, therefore, did not satisfy “the threshold\n\nrequirements       of   demonstrating       the   existence”    of    such    rights.\n\nId. at 97.       Although the sections of the Enabling Act providing\n\nfor Arizona’s and New Mexico’s land grants are distinct, the\n\nlanguage and context of the separate sections are substantially\n\nsimilar for purposes of analyzing the State’s reserved water\n\nright claim here.

That   provision    preserved          the    land     for    use   by   the\n\nfederal      government     and    precluded          disposition,          unlike     the\n\nrelevant provisions here, which conveyed land to the state and\n\nallowed future sales and leases.                See Enabling Act, §§ 24-28, 36\n\nStat. at 572-74; supra ¶¶ 27-28.                The water power provision also\n\nconcerned     unique   land,      while        the   relevant        provisions        here\n\nconcerned random and uncertain lands.                  See id. § 29, 36 Stat. at\n\n575 (providing that bulk-grant and in-lieu selections must be\n\nfrom “unreserved, unappropriated, and nonmineral public lands”);\n\n\n                                          22\n\fAndrus, 446 U.S. at 523 (discussing section-in-place grants as\n\n“random     cross    section[s]          of    the     public       land”).       Thus,       if\n\nCongress    had     wanted       to    withdraw       and    reserve       for   a    federal\n\npurpose the lands it granted to the state, it could have done\n\nso.     See N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d at 97.\n\n¶36          For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the State\n\nTrust    Lands    were     not    withdrawn          and    reserved       for   a    federal\n\npurpose.      Thus,      these        lands    cannot       include    federal       reserved\n\nwater rights.\n\nE.      Congressional intent\n\n¶37          Even    had    the       State    Trust       Lands    been    withdrawn        and\n\nreserved, no evidence suggests that Congress intended to reserve\n\nwater    rights     on   those        lands.        The     State    contends        that    the\n\nfederal government’s relationship to the states is akin to its\n\nrelationship        to     the    Indian        tribes       and     posits      that       this\n\nrelationship compels a finding that Congress intended to reserve\n\nwater for State Trust Land development.                            We disagree.         Unlike\n\nreservations for the Indian tribes, land grants to the states\n\nare not the product of negotiated agreements or treaties.                                    See\n\nWinters, 207 U.S. at 575-76.                  Nor does the State cite authority\n\nfor resolving any ambiguities in state land grants “from the\n\nstandpoint of” the states.               See id. at 576; cf.

To\n\nsupport     this     contention,       the       State        quotes       Senator       Daniel\n\nWebster’s observation that throughout the region, “there is one\n\nfatal want of water.”            Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 1st Sess. 860\n\n(1850).     But Senator Webster was speaking about Texas boundaries\n\nas he advocated for establishing a territorial border to prevent\n\nTexas     from     claiming    land    that        could       help        the   New     Mexico\n\nTerritory      secure   the    population         needed       to    achieve        statehood.\n\nId.     Notably, the goal of increasing the Territory’s population\n\nwould also have been supported by ensuring that the region’s\n\nscarce    water     supply    was     obtainable         by    settlers          rather    than\n\nreserved.\n\n¶39          To enhance the value of its land grant to Arizona, the\n\nfederal     government       increased       the    number          of     school      section-\n\nin−place grants from two to four sections per township.                                     See\n\nEnabling Act, § 24, 36 Stat. at 572; N.M. Comm’r, 200 P.3d at\n\n98-99; Lassen, 385 U.S. at 463 n.7; cf. H.R. Rep.

Thus, we\n\n\n                                            24\n\fconclude that Congress intended to compensate for the relatively\n\nlow value of land granted to Arizona by augmenting the amount of\n\nland granted, not by reserving federal water rights for those\n\nlands.
