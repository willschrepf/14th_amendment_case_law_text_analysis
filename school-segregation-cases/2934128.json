Smith appeals the trial court’s judgment enjoining him from using a road located\n\non property owned by Lawrence Reid, Royce H. Reid, Jennifer Heath, and THL GP, Inc.\n\n(collectively, the Reids). In four issues, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that\n\nthe road is not a public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3)\n\ndetermining that Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees. We\n\nmodify the award of attorney’s fees to comport with the trial testimony regarding segregation of\n\nfees. We further modify the award of appellate attorney’s fees to condition such award on an\n\nunsuccessful appeal by Smith. As modified, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\n         The Reids are the owners of approximately 1,231.6-acres of real property located in\n\nEdwards County known as the Reid Ranch. The Reid Ranch consists of nine tracts of land. The\n\nReids trace their ownership of the ranch to Royce I. Reid, who acquired the ranch by General\n\nWarranty Deed dated May 14, 1953. The May 14, 1953 Warranty Deed does not contain any\n\nexception for any easement benefiting adjoining property.\n\n         Smith owns 720.222 acres of land adjoining the Reid Ranch (“Smith Ranch”). The Smith\n\nRanch includes two tracts: a 639.192-acre tract and an 81.03-acre tract (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe 640-acre tract and the 81-acre tract). Smith acquired the 640-acre tract from Denman L. Cloudt\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated May 8, 2003 (“Cloudt Deed”). The 81-acre tract was acquired\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated February 19, 2010. Neither Warranty Deed contains reference\n\nto conveyance of an easement or other appurtenant right over and across any portion of the Reid\n\nRanch.\n\n         Edwards County Road 330 originates at a point of intersection with State Highway 55 on\n\nthe southeastern boundary of Reid Ranch. County Road 330 traverses Reid Ranch. There is a\n\nroad known as “the spur road” which departs from Edwards County Road 330 in a generally\n                                                  -2-\n\f                                                                                     04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nwesterly direction crossing from east to west across portions of the Reid Ranch. Specifically, the\n\nspur road crosses the sixth tract and the third tract of the Reid Ranch. The spur road then enters\n\ninto the Smith Ranch at a point such that it intersects the boundary line between the Reid Ranch\n\nand the Smith Ranch. For a number of years, the Reids permitted Smith and his predecessors in\n\ntitle to use the spur road to conveniently access his 640-acre tract. The following map was admitted\n\nat trial:\n\n\n\n\n(The thick black line is the spur road; the yellow line is County Road 330; and the blue line is\n\nPulliam Creek).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n           Bay-Houston Towing Co. owned property south of the Smith Ranch. In 2007, Bay-\n\nHouston sued Smith in an attempt to establish the right to use the spur road to travel across Smith’s\n\nproperty. Because Bay-Houston also had to use a portion of the Reid Ranch to reach its property,\n\nSmith asked for leave of court to join the Reids in the litigation, and pointed out that both the Reids\n\nand “Edwards County officials . . . contest and dispute that this roadway over the Reid Ranch is a\n\npublic highway.” In their answer to Smith’s Third Party Petition, the Reids denied “that all or any\n\nportion of the roadway in question is a public road.” To avoid litigation, the Reids entered into a\n\nRule 11 agreement with Bay-Houston providing that they would give Bay-Houston permission to\n\nuse the spur road across Reid Ranch if Bay-Houston won its suit against Smith. Smith then non-\n\nsuited his third party claim against the Reids. Bay-Houston lost at trial and was not allowed to use\n\nthe spur road across Smith’s property, thus rendering the Rule 11 agreement moot.\n\n           In February 2010, Smith purchased an additional 81-acre tract bordering his 640-acre tract\n\nand the Reid Ranch to the east. The 81-acre tract gave Smith direct access from State Highway\n\n55 to his 640-acre tract. Smith installed a gate to access his property from the state highway.\n\n           Upon noticing the new gate and learning that Smith no longer needed to cross Reid Ranch\n\nto access his property, Lawrence Reid wrote a letter to Smith dated March 11, 2010. The letter\n\ncongratulates Reid on his recent purchase of land and further states:\n\n           Since your new acquisition provides direct access to State of Texas Highway 55, I\n           request we speak soon to discuss your current ingress through our property. We\n           have acted neighborly in the past and wish to continue in such manner, however\n           any necessity of yours to cross our property has now ceased. It is my belief and\n           desire that an acceptable time frame for you to complete your new entrance be\n           reached to accommodate everyone’s needs and wishes.\n\nThe letter was posted on Smith’s gate. 2 Smith did not respond to the letter; at trial, he claimed he\n\nnever received the letter. Having never heard from Smith, in late May 2010, the Reids blocked\n\n\n2\n    Royce Reid testified that the letter was posted on the gate “numerous times.”\n\n                                                           -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nthe spur road with a tractor to prevent Smith from using it. Royce was at the house when Smith\n\nattempted to access the road. Royce informed Smith that he no longer needed to use the road.\n\nSmith responded that “he thought he had some type of right to traverse that property.” Smith could\n\nnot explain what right he thought he had, so Royce then moved the tractor and told Smith he had\n\ntwo months to find his proof of access. The Reids left the road unblocked all summer, but Smith\n\nnever contacted the Reids, so the Reids blocked the road again on Labor Day weekend. This time\n\nthey blocked the road with rocks and a gooseneck trailer. Smith still did not contact the Reids.\n\n       On November 18, 2010, the Reids filed suit against Smith, asking for a temporary\n\ninjunction and for a declaration that Smith has no right to use the spur road. The Reids were\n\ngranted a temporary restraining order prohibiting Smith from using the spur road across the Reid\n\nRanch. Smith then began exclusively using his property to access the 640-acre tract from State\n\nHighway 55.\n\n       A few months later, Smith approached the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court and\n\nasked the court to declare that the spur road is a county road. On February 8, 2011, the\n\ncommissioners’ court adopted a resolution titled “Smith Road Spur to County Road 330.” The\n\nresolution provides that:\n\n       [T]here is evidence that [the spur road] has been and remains a County Road, to-\n       wit: (1) Resolution of the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court dated June 11,\n       1998 and recorded in Vol. 12, Pg[.] 543 of the Minutes of the Commissioners’\n       Court of Edwards County, Texas, (2) Written statement of Marshall Craig, former\n       Precinct #2 Commission of Edwards County, Texas, recorded April 12, 1978 in\n       Vol[.] 6 at [P]g[.] 29 of the Deed Records of Edwards County, Texas, and (3) verbal\n       statement of Lee Sweeten, current Precinct #2 Commissioner of Edwards County,\n       Texas, that he performed road maintenance work on said spur while employed by\n       the Edwards County Road Department in the mid-1970s[.]\n\nBased on this evidence, the commissioners’ court found and ordered that the spur road “has been\n\nand continues to be a county road for all purposes,” and that the “spur shall hereinafter be included\n\nas part of the county road inventory[.]” However, the resolution concludes that the spur road “shall\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                            04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nnot be added to the official County Road map until such future time as [Transportation Code]\n\nproceedings are completed . . . and adding said spur road to the map is expressly ordered by this\n\nCourt.” The June 11, 1998 minutes reflect that the commissioners passed a motion providing that\n\n“the spur off of road #204 3 that goes to the Moore Ranch has been considered part of the County\n\nroad system . . . and has been historically worked as a county road, therefore, be it resolved that it\n\nis hereby confirmed that it be part of the County Road system and shall remain as such for all\n\npurposes.” There is no evidence that the spur road was subsequently added to the official County\n\nroad map.\n\n        Smith did not inform the Reids or the trial court that he was seeking action from the County\n\nin 2011. He also failed to inform the commissioners that a lawsuit was pending and a temporary\n\nrestraining order had been issued preventing him from using the spur road across the Reid Ranch.\n\nAt trial, County Judge Souli Shanklin testified that the commissioners had no knowledge that the\n\nspur road was the subject of pending litigation, and that had they known, they would not have\n\nadopted the resolution. Shanklin testified that the commissioners’ court learned about the lawsuit\n\nand temporary restraining order immediately after the February 8, 2011 meeting recessed, when\n\nthe sheriff asked Smith “to go out with him to show him what needed to be done, and Smith told\n\nhim that he could not because there was a restraining order against him on that deal.”\n\n        When the Reids learned about the 2011 resolution, they joined Edwards County as a third-\n\nparty defendant in the underlying lawsuit and challenged the validity of the resolution. On May\n\n19, 2012, Edwards County entered into an agreed judgment with the Reids wherein the County\n\nagreed that the February 8, 2011 resolution “was not intended to acquire any public rights in any\n\nroad spur off of County Road 330 as described in the resolution; and to the extent the resolution is\n\n\n3\n County Road 330 was previously assigned the number 204; the Reids do not concede, however, that the “Moore\nRanch” mentioned in the 1998 order is the same property as that currently located within the 640-acre tract.\n\n                                                    -6-\n\f                                                                                                  04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nalleged to be an act acquiring or attempting to acquire public rights in the spur under Chapters [sic]\n\n281 or Chapter 258 of the Texas Transportation Code,” the resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. Further, the County agreed that “the Resolution specifically withheld the addition of the\n\nspur as a county road on the County’s Texas Transportation Code Chapter 258 County Road Map.”\n\nFinally, the County agreed that it “made no effort to comply with the notice and other procedures\n\nrequired by Chapters 281 and 258 of the Texas Transportation Code.” By entry of the agreed\n\njudgment, the Reids nonsuited the County. The County, therefore, did not participate in the\n\nunderlying trial, and stipulated that it would agree to be bound by the trial court’s judgment.\n\n        In May 2011, the Reids amended their petition to add an allegation related to a small, 1.165-\n\nacre piece of land located near the southern boundary of Reid Ranch and the northern boundary of\n\nSmith’s 640-acre tract. The 1.165-acre tract of land has been referred to throughout this litigation\n\nas the “bubble.” The “bubble” contains a natural spring that was fenced in to avoid washouts. The\n\nReids’ new claim alleged prior owners of the two ranches had agreed the “bubble” was a part of\n\nthe Reid Ranch and that future owners would not claim the “bubble” by adverse possession. Smith\n\nfiled an answer asserting the affirmative defenses of easement by estoppel, adverse possession,\n\nand impermissible collateral attack.\n\n        After multiple summary judgment motions were denied, the case proceeded to a bench trial\n\non March 26, 2013. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated on the record that: there is no record access,\n\neasements, or agreements across the Reid tracts in favor of the Smith tracts; and there are no\n\nrecorded dedications, purchases, condemnation, or final judgment of adverse possession in favor\n\nof the public as to any portion of the Reid Ranch as it relates to the spur road. 4 The trial court\n\nheard testimony from multiple witnesses and admitted documentary evidence. Following the\n\n\n4\n The parties further stipulated that Smith abandoned his claim that the spur road is a public road by virtue of the\ndoctrine of implied dedication and his claim of easement by necessity across the Reid property.\n\n                                                       -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nbench trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the Reids, finding that: the spur road is not a public\n\nroad; the spur road is not an easement appurtenant to the Smith tract; the Cloudt Deed creates a\n\ncloud upon the Reids’ title to the sixth and third tracts (i.e., the “bubble”); Smith claimed the\n\nbubble by adverse possession; the claim by Smith to adverse possession of the bubble was a breach\n\nof an express covenant not to so claim the land by adverse possession; and the Reids are entitled\n\nto enforce the terms of the express covenant not to claim the land by adverse possession. The trial\n\ncourt therefore ordered that the parties are authorized to place boundary fences and that the Reids\n\nare granted a permanent injunction against Smith prohibiting him from utilizing any portion of the\n\nReid Ranch to access the Smith Ranch. The trial court also awarded the Reids court costs and\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $79,171.30 for trial and $20,000 for appeal. The trial court signed\n\ntwo sets of findings of fact conclusions of law in support of its judgment.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n       On appeal, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that the spur road is not\n\na public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3) determining\n\nthat Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees to the Reids.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       In an appeal from a judgment rendered after a bench trial, the trial court’s findings of fact\n\nhave the same weight as a jury’s verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence used to support them, just as we would review a jury’s findings. Catalina v. Blasdel, 881\n\nS.W.2d 295, 297 (Tex. 1994). In conducting a legal sufficiency review, we consider all of the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every reasonable inference that\n\nwould support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005). In determining\n\nwhether legally sufficient evidence supports the finding under review, we must consider evidence\n\nfavorable to the finding if a reasonable fact finder could consider it, and disregard evidence\n                                                -8-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00550-CV\n\n\ncontrary to the finding unless a reasonable factfinder could not disregard it. Id. at 827. When a\n\nparty attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on which it did not have the burden of\n\nproof, it must demonstrate that there is no evidence to support the adverse finding. Croucher v.\n\nCroucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983). We will sustain a legal-sufficiency or “no evidence”\n\nchallenge if the record shows one of the following: (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital\n\nfact, (2) rules of law or evidence bar the court from giving weight to the only evidence offered to\n\nprove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla, or (4)\n\nthe evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at\n\n810.\n\n       In conducting a factual-sufficiency review, we review all of the evidence in a neutral light\n\nand will reverse only if the evidence supporting the finding is so weak or the finding is so against\n\nthe great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong or manifestly unjust.\n\nSee Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). In a bench trial, the trial court\n\nis the sole judge of the witnesses’ credibility, and it may choose to believe one witness over\n\nanother; a reviewing court may not impose its own opinion to the contrary. See Golden Eagle\n\nArchery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).\n\n       We review a trial court’s conclusions of law de novo. BMC Software Belgium, N.V. v.\n\nMarchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex. 2002). Although a trial court’s conclusions of law may not\n\nbe challenged for factual sufficiency, we may review the legal conclusions drawn from the facts\n\nto determine whether the conclusions are correct. Id. If we determine that a conclusion of law is\n\nerroneous, but the trial court nevertheless rendered the proper judgment, the error does not require\n\nreversal. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nDeclaration of the spur road as private\n\n       Smith first argues that the trial court erred by declaring the spur road is a private road.\n\nSmith contends the declaration flies in the face of 30 years of official documents, including a 1998\n\norder and a 2011 resolution from the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court, showing that the\n\nspur road is a county road as a matter of law. Smith further argues that the Reids cannot collaterally\n\nattack the commissioners’ actions, such that the 2012 agreed judgment between the Reids and\n\nEdwards County does not nullify the 2011 resolution. The Reids respond that the spur road is not\n\na public road because the County failed to utilize any of the statutorily-authorized methods of\n\nacquiring the spur as public, and because the County clarified by way of a November 10, 1986\n\norder that the spur is not a public road by omitting it from its official list of county roads.\n\n       Chapter 281 of the Texas Transportation Code sets out four methods by which a county\n\nwith a population of 50,000 or less, such as Edwards County, may acquire a public interest in a\n\nprivate road. Under section 281.002, a county may acquire a public interest in a private road only\n\nby: (1) purchase; (2) condemnation; (3) dedication; or (4) a court’s final judgment of adverse\n\npossession. See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. § 281.002 (West 2013). A public interest in a private\n\nroad may not be asserted until the commissioners’ court has complied with the resolution\n\nrequirement of section 281.005 and provided written notice to the owner of the road. Id.\n\n§§ 281.005-.006 (West 2013); see also id. § 258.002 (West 2013) (outlining procedures for\n\nadoption of county road map). It is undisputed that Edwards County did not comply with any of\n\nthe statutorily-authorized methods of road creation as it relates to the spur road in either 2011 or\n\n1998. Most notably, the County failed to comply with the notice provisions. Actions by a\n\ncommissioners’ court may be declared void for failure to comply with statutory requirements. See\n\nJohnson v. Krieg, 175 S.W.2d 102, 103-04 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1943, writ ref’d w.o.m.)\n\n(affirming trial court’s finding that commissioners’ court order was void because it was made\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nwithout notice to landowner). Lawrence Reid testified that, prior to filing the lawsuit at issue,\n\nneither he nor any other member of his family was notified that Edwards County was\n\ncontemplating the status of the road. He further stated that they never received any notice from\n\nthe County with respect to the spur road, meaning that the Reids had no notice of the 1970s\n\ncommissioners’ statements or the 1998 order or the 2011 resolution. Jennifer Reid Smith testified\n\nsimilarly. The trial court was free to consider the evidence that no notice was provided to the\n\nReids before designating the spur road as a county road, as well as the fact that the spur road was\n\nnever added to the official county road map, 5 in concluding that the spur road is in fact a private\n\nroad.\n\n         In addition, the trial court was free to consider the 2012 agreed judgment memorializing\n\nan agreement between the County and the Reids in which the County disavowed any interest the\n\npublic might have in the spur road and agreed that the 2011 resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. The agreed judgment leaves no doubt that the County did not intend to acquire any\n\npublic rights in the spur road. We also note that the 2011 resolution relied on the 1978 statement\n\nof former commissioner Marshall Craig and the “mid-1970s” verbal statement of current\n\ncommissioner Lee Sweeten in finding that the spur road is a county road. Because individual\n\nmembers of the commissioners’ court have no authority to bind the county by their separate\n\nactions, these statements do not constitute conclusive proof that the spur road is a public road. See\n\nEx parte Conger, 163 Tex. 505, 357 S.W.2d 740, 743 (1962); Canales v. Laughlin, 147 Tex. 169,\n\n214 S.W.2d 451, 455 (1948). The 1998 order similarly does not constitute conclusive proof that\n\nthe spur road was public because, as earlier discussed, the order was made without prior notice to\n\n\n\n5\n  The 2011 resolution specifically provided that the spur road would not be added to the official county road map until\nthe proper statutory requirements were satisfied and “adding said spur to the map is expressly ordered by this Court.”\n\n\n                                                        - 11 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nthe Reids. See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. §§ 281.005-.006 (commissioners’ court must comply\n\nwith resolution requirement of section 281.005 and provide written notice to landowner before\n\nasserting public interest in a private road).\n\n         Finally, we reject Smith’s argument that the 2012 agreed judgment is an impermissible\n\ncollateral attack on an order of the commissioners’ court. See Hanks v. Smith, 74 S.W.3d 409, 412\n\n(Tex. App.—Tyler 2001, pet. denied). 6 A collateral attack is an “attempt to avoid the effect of a\n\njudgment in a proceeding brought for some other purpose. A direct attack on a judgment,\n\nconversely, is an attempt to change that judgment in a proceeding brought for that specific purpose,\n\nsuch as an appeal or a bill of review.” Nw. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Carroll Indep. Sch. Dist., 441\n\nS.W.3d 684, 692 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2014, pet. denied). Because the County was joined in\n\nthe lawsuit filed by the Reids, the 2012 agreed judgment between the County and the Reids cannot\n\nconstitute a collateral attack on the 2011 resolution.\n\n         Mindful of the fact that the fact-finder is the sole judge of the witnesses’ testimony and of\n\nthe weight to be given to their testimony under both a legal and a factual sufficiency review, we\n\nconclude that the evidence presented at trial would allow “reasonable and fair-minded people to\n\nreach the” decision made by the trial court, and that the trial court’s findings regarding the private\n\nnature of the road are not “so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly\n\nwrong and unjust.” City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819, 827; Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176\n\n\n\n6\n  In Hanks, a landowner sought a declaration that a certain road was public despite a commissioners’ court ruling to\nthe contrary. Hanks, 74 S.W.3d at 410-11. The appellate court recited the general rule that “absent a showing of gross\nabuse of discretion, fraud or collusion in the commissioners’ court’s opening of a road, the order of the commissioners’\ncourt is binding and conclusive” and the judgment is not subject to collateral attack. Id. at 412. The appellate court\ntherefore held that the order of the commissioners’ court reaffirming that the road was a county road was conclusive\nevidence on the issue of the status of the road, and that the trial court therefore erred in finding that the road was\nprivate. Id. The court went on, however, to note that a subsequent order of the commissioners’ court “released all\nclaim” the County had in the road, thereby abandoning the road. Id. Thus, the appellate court ultimately affirmed the\ntrial court’s declaration that the road was private. Id. at 414. To the extent that Smith contends that the Hanks court\nreversed the trial court’s summary judgment, he is mistaken.\n\n\n                                                         - 12 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n(Tex. 1986). Accordingly, we overrule Smith’s sufficiency complaint and hold that the evidence\n\npresented at trial was sufficient to support the trial court’s declaration that the spur road is not a\n\npublic road.\n\nEasement by Estoppel\n\n       Smith next argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s denial of an easement by estoppel. The trial court found that:\n\n       The Reids never made any representation of the existence of an easement in favor\n       of Smith or Smith’s property across and over any portion of the Reids’ property or\n       the spur road; and\n\n       The Reids never made any false or fraudulent statements or representations to\n       Smith regarding access or use of the spur road, or represented to Smith that the\n       Reids had or would dedicate the road to the public, or grant to Smith a private\n       easement.\n\nThree elements are necessary to the creation of an easement by estoppel: 1) a representation\n\ncommunicated, either by word or action, to the promisee; 2) the communication was believed; and\n\n3) the promisee relied on the communication. Storms v. Tuck, 579 S.W.2d 447, 452 (Tex. 1979);\n\nHolden v. Weidenfeller, 929 S.W.2d 124, 131 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996, writ denied). Under\n\nthis doctrine, a landowner may be estopped from denying the existence of an easement created by\n\n“representations” upon which another has detrimentally relied. Drye v. Eagle Rock Ranch, Inc.,\n\n364 S.W.2d 196, 209 (Tex. 1963).\n\n       Smith contends that he proved the elements of easement by estoppel by way of the\n\nfollowing undisputed evidence at trial: Smith, his predecessors in interest, and other landowners\n\nregularly used the spur road without contest by Reid; the spur road was the only way in and out of\n\nthe Smith Ranch due to frequent washouts and floods. Smith leased the 640-acre tract for three\n\nyears before purchasing it from Cloudt, and relied on the unimpeded use of the spur road when\n\ndeciding to purchase the property. Smith made improvements to his land, and relied on use of the\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nspur road in doing so. He contends that the Reids’ silence regarding the status of the road, and his\n\nreliance on such, constitutes an easement by estoppel. 7\n\n         An easement by estoppel may not be predicated upon silence and passive acquiescence\n\nalone. See Scott v. Cannon, 959 S.W.2d 712, 721 (Tex. App.—Austin 1998, pet. denied) (mere\n\nsilence cannot create an easement by estoppel except where there is a vendor-vendee relationship\n\nbetween the parties); see also Stallman v. Newman, 9 S.W.3d 243, 247 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied) (finding that passive acquiescence in and of itself cannot rise to the level\n\nof a “misrepresentation” so as to create an easement by estoppel where there has never been any\n\nunity of title between the two tracts of land). In the absence of a vendor/vendee relationship, there\n\nwas no duty on the Reids to caution or warn Smith or his predecessors-in-title that they should\n\nmake no improvements upon their property without a secure right of ingress and egress\n\nappurtenant to their land. See Roberts v. Allison, 836 S.W.2d 185, 188 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1992,\n\nwrit denied).\n\n         It is undisputed that the Reids never made an affirmative representation to Smith that the\n\nspur road was public, or that an easement existed in favor of Smith. It is further uncontested that\n\nSmith’s use of the road across the Reids’ property was always permissive, up until the time he\n\npurchased the 81-acre tract. The Reids made no misrepresentation, nor did they engage in\n\noverreaching conduct by their silence; they had no duty to speak. See Wilson v. McGuffin, 749\n\nS.W.2d 606, 610-11 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1988, writ denied). Although Smith may have\n\nmade improvements upon his property, the record contains no evidence that he made the\n\nimprovements in reliance on any express promise by the Reids. Further, this case does not involve\n\na landlocked tract, and once Smith purchased the additional acreage in 2010, alternative means of\n\n\n7\n Smith also argues that the Reids’ affirmative actions in the Bay-Houston litigation (i.e., agreeing to give Bay-Houston\nan easement over the spur road) operated to create an easement by estoppel.\n\n                                                         - 14 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\ningress and egress to the Smith property were available without use of the spur road across the\n\nReid Ranch. Accordingly, Smith has failed to establish any of the elements of an easement by\n\nestoppel and we therefore overrule his second issue.\n\nBreach of Covenant Not to Adversely Possess the “Bubble”\n\n       Smith took title to his 640-acre tract subject to a covenant not to claim the Reids’ land by\n\nadverse possession. The Reids’ and Smith’s predecessors in title executed the agreement because\n\nthe terrain of their ranches required the fence-line to deviate from the true boundary line in several\n\nplaces, and neither wanted the deviation to turn into a claim of adverse possession. The Reids’\n\npredecessor in title, R.T. Craig, and Smith’s predecessor in title, J.A. Blalack, struck the following\n\nagreement:\n\n       WHEREAS, it was and is the intention of said parties to claim their respective lands\n       according to survey lines and according to the description contained in the several\n       deeds of conveyance under which said parties own and possess said respective\n       lands and not to claim said lands as differently divided by the division fence\n       between said parties as above shown . . . .\n\n       WHEREAS, said parties desire to evidence in writing said arrangement and to show\n       that they did not and do not intend to claim and possess said premises adversely to\n       each other:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That we, R.T.\n       Craig and J.A. Blalack, in consideration of the premises, hereby mutually agree that\n       we do not claim adversely to each other . . . J.A. Blalack for himself likewise\n       contracts and agrees to and with the said R.T. Craig that he, the said J.A. Blalack\n       has not claimed . . . the said portion of the South West one-fourth of Survey 50\n       which is cut into the outside inclosure [of] the said J.A. Blalack and further likewise\n       agrees that he does not and will not claim or assert any interest or title therein but\n       holds said premises subject to the claim and ownership of the said R.T. Craig and\n       the said parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.\n\nThe Reids pleaded that Smith’s deed, which contained a “bubble” of land within their boundary,\n\nconstituted a cloud on their title and constituted a breach of the covenant not to adversely possess.\n\nIn the final judgment, the trial court found that “Smith claimed such ‘bubble’ by virtue of adverse\n\npossession” and that assertion of this claim is “in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nclaim land . . . by adverse possession.” On appeal, Smith asserts that this finding is not supported\n\nby legally or factually sufficient evidence.\n\n         First, Smith argues that the Reids’ breach of covenant claim is barred by a four-year statute\n\nof limitations. See Malmgren v. Inverness Forest Residents Civic Club, Inc., 981 S.W.2d 875, 877\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (“Actions to enforce restrictive covenants are\n\ncontrolled by the four-year statute of limitations.”). The Reids respond that Smith has waived his\n\naffirmative defense of limitations because he failed to plead or argue it below. Smith’s “Fourth\n\nAmended Original Answer, Counter-Claim and Affirmative Defenses,” contains a section titled\n\n“Claims/Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading are two claims/affirmative defenses: (A)\n\nEasement by Estoppel and (B) Adverse Possession. The “adverse possession” heading contains\n\nthe following language:\n\n                 The Defendant, relying on his own deed from D.L. Cloudt in 2003, claims\n         ownership of “the bubble,” which lies at the entrance to the Smith tract, further\n         states that Plaintiffs’ alleged cause of action is barred by limitations set forth in\n         Sections 16.024, 16.025[,] and 16.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n         Code. The deed to Smith dated May 2003 is recorded in Volume 212, Page 821 of\n         the Edwards County deed records.\n\n                Moreover, “the bubble” was conveyed to Smith’s predecessor, Denman L.\n         Cloudt (“Cloudt”) by Deed dated November 16, 1998, recorded at Volume 161,\n         Page 364 of the Edwards County deed records. “The bubble” is described by metes\n         and bounds in the Deed to Cloudt. “The bubble” has been under fence and\n         considered part of what is the Smith Ranch since the 1970’s, prior to both Cloudt\n         and Smith’s ownership.\n\n(Emphasis added). 8 Sections 16.024-.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code pertain\n\nto adverse possession; none of the sections contain a four-year limitations period. See TEX. CIV.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  The pleading also contains a second section titled “Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading, four affirmative\ndefenses are listed as follows: “(A) Estoppel; (B) Estoppel / Silence / Duty to Speak; (C) Adverse Possession; and (D)\nImpermissible Collateral Attack.” There is no mention of the term “limitations” within the discussion of these\naffirmative defenses.\n\n                                                        - 16 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 16.024-.026 (West 2002) (providing three, five, and ten-year\n\nlimitations period for adverse possession claims).\n\n       We agree that Smith’s pleadings, which only briefly mention limitations under the adverse\n\npossession heading, failed to put the Reids on notice that he was claiming a limitations defense.\n\nSee TEX. R. CIV. P. 45, 47. A review of Smith’s live pleading would not have provided notice to\n\na reasonably competent attorney of Smith’s intent to assert the affirmative defense of limitations.\n\nSee Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887, 897 (Tex. 2000); Broom v.\n\nBrookshire Bros., Inc., 923 S.W.2d 57, 60 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1995, writ denied). Smith contends\n\nthat absent the Reids’ failure to specially except to his pleading, his pleading is sufficient and he\n\ndid not waive his affirmative defense of limitations. We disagree that there was any defect in the\n\npleadings calling for special exceptions. See Auld, 34 S.W.3d at 896 (stating an opposing party\n\nshould use special exceptions to identify defects in a pleading so that they may be cured, if\n\npossible, by amendment). The Reids were entitled to rely on Smith’s specific pleading of “adverse\n\npossession,” and were not required to alert Smith to another possible theory of recovery. See\n\nItalian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 S.W.3d 323, 345 (Tex. 2011) (“A\n\nparty is not required to specially except to a pleading defect if it lacks notice of the other party’s\n\nintent.”). Because limitations is an affirmative defense that is waived unless affirmatively pleaded,\n\nSmith has failed to preserve his limitations complaint for our review. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 94; Fed.\n\nDeposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602, 611 (Tex. 2012).\n\n       Second, Smith contends that he is not bound by the Craig-Blalack agreement and that the\n\nagreement is not tied to the “bubble.” We again disagree. The Craig-Blalock agreement provides\n\nthat the “parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.” Because the\n\noriginal parties to the agreement intended it to be binding upon their heirs and assigns, the covenant\n\nruns with the land. See Inwood N. Homeowners’ Ass’n, Inc. v. Harris, 736 S.W.2d 632, 635 (Tex.\n                                                - 17 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n1987) (“In Texas, a covenant runs with the land when it touches and concerns the land; relates to\n\na thing in existence or specifically binds the parties and their assigns; is intended by the original\n\nparties to run with the land; and when the successor to the burden has notice.”); see also Montfort\n\nv. Trek Res., Inc., 198 S.W.3d 344, 355 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2006, no pet.) (intent to run with\n\nthe land may be evidenced by language stating that covenant binds drafters’ “successors and\n\nassigns”). As such, Smith was bound by the covenant not to adversely possess the bubble.\n\n       Third, Smith argues the trial court’s negative finding as to adverse possession precludes a\n\nfinding of breach of covenant. This argument is disingenuous, because the agreement merely\n\nprohibits a “claim” or assertion of interest in the property—it is immaterial that the claim of\n\nadverse possession turns out to be unmeritorious or unsuccessful. We therefore cannot agree that\n\nthe trial court erred in finding that Smith claimed the “bubble” by adverse possession and that\n\nassertion of this claim constituted a breach of an express covenant. We overrule Smith’s issue\n\nrelated to breach of the covenant not to adversely possess the “bubble.”\n\nAttorney’s Fees\n\n       It is undisputed that the Reids sought recovery of attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 (breach\n\nof the covenant), under Chapter 37 (the Declaratory Judgments Act), and under common law. As\n\nto attorney’s fees, the trial court’s judgment provides:\n\n       Under the discretionary powers of the Court to award attorneys fees under Chapter\n       38 of the Texas Civil Practices [sic] and Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded\n       attorneys fees against the Defendant, Randy K. Smith[,] through the trial in the\n       amount of $79,171.30, and are conditionally awarded attorney fees against\n       Defendant, Randy K. Smith[,] in the event that the Defendant Smith appeals this\n       matter to the 4th Court of Appeals in the amount of $20,000.\n\nOn appeal, Smith asks that we vacate the award of attorney’s fees. Smith claims: (1) the trial court\n\nawarded attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code; and (2)\n\nthe Reids did not succeed on any Chapter 38 claims. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f                                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n§ 38.001 (West 2008). 9 We disagree with Smith’s narrow reading of the judgment, and hold that\n\nthe trial court’s judgment awards attorney’s fees based on both the Chapter 38 claim and the Reids’\n\nChapter 37 claims for declaratory relief. We further hold the Reids’ successful breach of covenant\n\nclaim is equivalent to a Chapter 38 breach of contract claim.\n\n         With regard to whether the Reids are entitled to recover attorney’s fees under Chapter 38,\n\nSmith argues that the Reids did not succeed on any Chapter 38 claims. We disagree. The Reids’\n\nclaim for breach of the covenant not to adversely possess the “bubble” sounds in contract. See id.\n\n§ 38.001(8); Davis v. Canyon Creek Estates Homeowners Ass’n, 350 S.W.3d 301, 313 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 2011, pet. denied) (“A restrictive covenant is a contract subject to the same\n\nrules of construction and interpretation as any other contract.”); Candlewood Creek Neighborhood\n\nAss’n v.

(holding that a covenant is a contract between the parties, and that\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees is permitted on a breach of contract action under section 38.001(8));\n\nbut see Tanglewood Homes Ass’n, Inc. v. Feldman, 436 S.W.3d 48, 74-75 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2014, pet. denied) (holding that breach of deed restriction cannot authorize award of\n\nattorney’s fees under Chapter 38).               Attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 are mandatory, not\n\ndiscretionary. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001; World Help v. Leisure Lifestyles,\n\nInc., 977 S.W.2d 662, 683 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1998, pet. denied) (“When a prevailing party\n\nin a breach of contract suit seeks attorney’s fees, an award of reasonable fees is mandatory under\n\nsection 38.001 if there is proof of the reasonableness of the fees.”). Accordingly, we conclude that\n\n\n\n\n9\n Section 38.001 provides: “A person may recover reasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in\naddition to the amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for . . . an oral or written contract.” TEX.

CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West 2008).\n\n                                                          - 19 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nthe Reids did prevail on a Chapter 38 breach of contract claim and that the award of attorney’s\n\nfees under Chapter 38 was proper. 10\n\n          With regard to whether the judgment awards attorney’s fees only under Chapter 38, we\n\nhold that the award of attorney’s fees is not limited to just the breach of contract claim, but is also\n\nbased on the Reids’ successful Chapter 37 claims for declaratory relief. Although the portion of\n\nthe trial court’s judgment pertaining to the award of attorney’s fees is not a model of clarity, our\n\nreading of it—in conjunction with the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law—leads\n\nus to conclude that the trial court intended to award attorney’s fees under both Chapter 37 and\n\nChapter 38. See Sw. Craft Ctr. v. Heilner, 670 S.W.2d 651, 655 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1984,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.) (holding that when variance exists between judgment and findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, the findings of fact and conclusions of law control if they are filed after the\n\njudgment). In this case, the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed over a\n\nmonth after the final judgment. Accordingly, the findings of fact and conclusions of law control.\n\nSee id.\n\n          In its findings of fact, the trial court, as the factfinder, found: “No. 39. The Plaintiffs\n\nincurred reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees through trial on the merits in the amount of\n\n$79,171.30.” In addition, the trial court made the following conclusions regarding attorney’s fees:\n\n          No. 2. Defendant Smith, in asserting a claim for adverse possession to land in the\n          SW ¼ of Survey 50, Abstract 2705 GC & SF Ry Co., breached such express\n          covenant, and in so breaching, Defendant Smith is liable for Plaintiffs’ attorney’s\n          fees and costs under Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001.\n\n          No. 22. The award to the Plaintiffs of attorneys’ fees and costs including those\n          which will result from an appeal to the Fourth Court of Appeals is equitable and\n          just.\n\n10\n   Smith’s reliance on Perez v. Tex. Disposal Sys., Inc., 103 S.W.3d 591, 592 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet.\ndenied), is misplaced because it pertains to the recovery of attorney’s fees under section 15.51 of the Texas Business\nand Commerce Code. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51 (West 2011) (“Procedures and Remedies in Actions\nto Enforce Covenants Not to Compete”).\n\n                                                        - 20 -\n\f                                                                                                         04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n           Section 37.009 of the Declaratory Judgments Act provides: “In any proceeding under this\n\nchapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable\n\nand just.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.009 (West 2008). The Act imposes four\n\nlimitations on the trial court’s discretion in deciding whether to award attorney fees or not.\n\nBocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998). Id. First, the factfinder must determine that\n\nthe fees are reasonable. Id. Second, the factfinder must determine that the fees are necessary. Id.\n\nThe remaining limitations on attorney fees awards are that they must be equitable and just. Id.\n\nSuch matters are determined by the trial court, in its discretion, as a matter of law. Id.\n\n           Here, the trial court, as factfinder, found that the fees were reasonable and necessary. It\n\nalso concluded that the award of fees was equitable and just. The trial court thus made the findings\n\nand legal determinations necessary to support an award of attorney’s fees under the Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act.           See id.     Accordingly, when reading the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law in conjunction with the judgment, we conclude that the trial court’s award of\n                                                                                                              11\nattorney’s fees was also based on the Reids’ successful claims for declaratory judgment.\n\n           Finally, we address Smith’s alternate complaint that the amount of attorney’s fees awarded\n\ndoes not comport with the evidence of segregation of fees. At trial, counsel for the Reids testified\n\nthat the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred in prosecuting the Reids’ case through\n\ntrial was $87,613.30, and supported this figure with itemized invoices. Evidence was also\n\nintroduced that appellate attorney’s fees would amount to $20,000. The Reids’ counsel further\n\ntestified that he spent 10% of his time on the adverse possession claim; 30% on the abandoned\n\nclaims of easement by necessity and public road by implied dedication; 30% on the 2011\n\nresolution; and 30% on the temporary restraining order, request for declarations, and defending\n\n\n\n11\n     Smith does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award of attorney’s fees.\n\n                                                          - 21 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nthe easement by estoppel. In accordance with the evidence presented, the trial court found that\n\n$79,171.30 should be awarded as attorney’s fees through trial—a reduction of $8,442 in the\n\namount proved by the Reids—and $20,000 should be awarded on appeal.\n\n         Based on the testimony segregating the fees, Smith contends the Reids could only recover\n\nten percent of the total award of fees for their breach of contract claim. Although we agree the\n\naward must comport with the testimony segregating the fees, we hold that the Reids are entitled to\n\nthe corresponding percentage of time spent on both Chapter 38 and Chapter 37 claims.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the award of attorney’s fees should be limited to seventy percent of the\n\ntotal amount of fees incurred through trial, or $55,419.91. 12\n\n         We also agree with Smith that the award of appellate attorney’s fees should have been\n\nconditioned on Smith’s unsuccessful appeal to this court. Appellate attorney’s fees must be\n\nconditioned on success in the appeal. Gilbert v. City of El Paso, 327 S.W.3d 332, 337-38 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2010, no pet.). We therefore modify the judgment to make the award of appellate\n\nattorney’s fees contingent upon an unsuccessful appeal by Smith. See Sundance Minerals, L.P. v.\n\nMoore, 354 S.W.3d 507, 515 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2011, pet. denied). As such, Smith’s final\n\nissue is sustained in part.\n\n                                                   CONCLUSION\n\n         The trial court’s judgment is modified to award $55,419.91 in attorney’s fees to the Reids\n\nbased on the breach of covenant claim and the claims for declaratory relief. Further, the award of\n\nappellate attorney’s fees to the Reids is conditioned on an unsuccessful appeal by Smith. With\n\nthese modifications, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n                                                            Rebeca C. Martinez, Justice\n\n12\n  All but thirty percent of counsel’s time was attributed to the claims for declaratory relief and the claim for breach\nof the covenant not to adversely possess. Counsel expressly testified that he spent thirty percent of his time on claims\nthat were “abandoned.” The award of attorney’s fees cannot be premised on abandoned claims.\n\n                                                         - 22 -\n\f",

Smith appeals the trial court’s judgment enjoining him from using a road located\n\non property owned by Lawrence Reid, Royce H. Reid, Jennifer Heath, and THL GP, Inc.\n\n(collectively, the Reids). In four issues, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that\n\nthe road is not a public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3)\n\ndetermining that Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees. We\n\nmodify the award of attorney’s fees to comport with the trial testimony regarding segregation of\n\nfees. We further modify the award of appellate attorney’s fees to condition such award on an\n\nunsuccessful appeal by Smith. As modified, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\n         The Reids are the owners of approximately 1,231.6-acres of real property located in\n\nEdwards County known as the Reid Ranch. The Reid Ranch consists of nine tracts of land. The\n\nReids trace their ownership of the ranch to Royce I. Reid, who acquired the ranch by General\n\nWarranty Deed dated May 14, 1953. The May 14, 1953 Warranty Deed does not contain any\n\nexception for any easement benefiting adjoining property.\n\n         Smith owns 720.222 acres of land adjoining the Reid Ranch (“Smith Ranch”). The Smith\n\nRanch includes two tracts: a 639.192-acre tract and an 81.03-acre tract (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe 640-acre tract and the 81-acre tract). Smith acquired the 640-acre tract from Denman L. Cloudt\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated May 8, 2003 (“Cloudt Deed”). The 81-acre tract was acquired\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated February 19, 2010. Neither Warranty Deed contains reference\n\nto conveyance of an easement or other appurtenant right over and across any portion of the Reid\n\nRanch.\n\n         Edwards County Road 330 originates at a point of intersection with State Highway 55 on\n\nthe southeastern boundary of Reid Ranch. County Road 330 traverses Reid Ranch. There is a\n\nroad known as “the spur road” which departs from Edwards County Road 330 in a generally\n                                                  -2-\n\f                                                                                     04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nwesterly direction crossing from east to west across portions of the Reid Ranch. Specifically, the\n\nspur road crosses the sixth tract and the third tract of the Reid Ranch. The spur road then enters\n\ninto the Smith Ranch at a point such that it intersects the boundary line between the Reid Ranch\n\nand the Smith Ranch. For a number of years, the Reids permitted Smith and his predecessors in\n\ntitle to use the spur road to conveniently access his 640-acre tract. The following map was admitted\n\nat trial:\n\n\n\n\n(The thick black line is the spur road; the yellow line is County Road 330; and the blue line is\n\nPulliam Creek).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n           Bay-Houston Towing Co. owned property south of the Smith Ranch. In 2007, Bay-\n\nHouston sued Smith in an attempt to establish the right to use the spur road to travel across Smith’s\n\nproperty. Because Bay-Houston also had to use a portion of the Reid Ranch to reach its property,\n\nSmith asked for leave of court to join the Reids in the litigation, and pointed out that both the Reids\n\nand “Edwards County officials . . . contest and dispute that this roadway over the Reid Ranch is a\n\npublic highway.” In their answer to Smith’s Third Party Petition, the Reids denied “that all or any\n\nportion of the roadway in question is a public road.” To avoid litigation, the Reids entered into a\n\nRule 11 agreement with Bay-Houston providing that they would give Bay-Houston permission to\n\nuse the spur road across Reid Ranch if Bay-Houston won its suit against Smith. Smith then non-\n\nsuited his third party claim against the Reids. Bay-Houston lost at trial and was not allowed to use\n\nthe spur road across Smith’s property, thus rendering the Rule 11 agreement moot.\n\n           In February 2010, Smith purchased an additional 81-acre tract bordering his 640-acre tract\n\nand the Reid Ranch to the east. The 81-acre tract gave Smith direct access from State Highway\n\n55 to his 640-acre tract. Smith installed a gate to access his property from the state highway.\n\n           Upon noticing the new gate and learning that Smith no longer needed to cross Reid Ranch\n\nto access his property, Lawrence Reid wrote a letter to Smith dated March 11, 2010. The letter\n\ncongratulates Reid on his recent purchase of land and further states:\n\n           Since your new acquisition provides direct access to State of Texas Highway 55, I\n           request we speak soon to discuss your current ingress through our property. We\n           have acted neighborly in the past and wish to continue in such manner, however\n           any necessity of yours to cross our property has now ceased. It is my belief and\n           desire that an acceptable time frame for you to complete your new entrance be\n           reached to accommodate everyone’s needs and wishes.\n\nThe letter was posted on Smith’s gate. 2 Smith did not respond to the letter; at trial, he claimed he\n\nnever received the letter. Having never heard from Smith, in late May 2010, the Reids blocked\n\n\n2\n    Royce Reid testified that the letter was posted on the gate “numerous times.”\n\n                                                           -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nthe spur road with a tractor to prevent Smith from using it. Royce was at the house when Smith\n\nattempted to access the road. Royce informed Smith that he no longer needed to use the road.\n\nSmith responded that “he thought he had some type of right to traverse that property.” Smith could\n\nnot explain what right he thought he had, so Royce then moved the tractor and told Smith he had\n\ntwo months to find his proof of access. The Reids left the road unblocked all summer, but Smith\n\nnever contacted the Reids, so the Reids blocked the road again on Labor Day weekend. This time\n\nthey blocked the road with rocks and a gooseneck trailer. Smith still did not contact the Reids.\n\n       On November 18, 2010, the Reids filed suit against Smith, asking for a temporary\n\ninjunction and for a declaration that Smith has no right to use the spur road. The Reids were\n\ngranted a temporary restraining order prohibiting Smith from using the spur road across the Reid\n\nRanch. Smith then began exclusively using his property to access the 640-acre tract from State\n\nHighway 55.\n\n       A few months later, Smith approached the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court and\n\nasked the court to declare that the spur road is a county road. On February 8, 2011, the\n\ncommissioners’ court adopted a resolution titled “Smith Road Spur to County Road 330.” The\n\nresolution provides that:\n\n       [T]here is evidence that [the spur road] has been and remains a County Road, to-\n       wit: (1) Resolution of the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court dated June 11,\n       1998 and recorded in Vol. 12, Pg[.] 543 of the Minutes of the Commissioners’\n       Court of Edwards County, Texas, (2) Written statement of Marshall Craig, former\n       Precinct #2 Commission of Edwards County, Texas, recorded April 12, 1978 in\n       Vol[.] 6 at [P]g[.] 29 of the Deed Records of Edwards County, Texas, and (3) verbal\n       statement of Lee Sweeten, current Precinct #2 Commissioner of Edwards County,\n       Texas, that he performed road maintenance work on said spur while employed by\n       the Edwards County Road Department in the mid-1970s[.]\n\nBased on this evidence, the commissioners’ court found and ordered that the spur road “has been\n\nand continues to be a county road for all purposes,” and that the “spur shall hereinafter be included\n\nas part of the county road inventory[.]” However, the resolution concludes that the spur road “shall\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                            04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nnot be added to the official County Road map until such future time as [Transportation Code]\n\nproceedings are completed . . . and adding said spur road to the map is expressly ordered by this\n\nCourt.” The June 11, 1998 minutes reflect that the commissioners passed a motion providing that\n\n“the spur off of road #204 3 that goes to the Moore Ranch has been considered part of the County\n\nroad system . . . and has been historically worked as a county road, therefore, be it resolved that it\n\nis hereby confirmed that it be part of the County Road system and shall remain as such for all\n\npurposes.” There is no evidence that the spur road was subsequently added to the official County\n\nroad map.\n\n        Smith did not inform the Reids or the trial court that he was seeking action from the County\n\nin 2011. He also failed to inform the commissioners that a lawsuit was pending and a temporary\n\nrestraining order had been issued preventing him from using the spur road across the Reid Ranch.\n\nAt trial, County Judge Souli Shanklin testified that the commissioners had no knowledge that the\n\nspur road was the subject of pending litigation, and that had they known, they would not have\n\nadopted the resolution. Shanklin testified that the commissioners’ court learned about the lawsuit\n\nand temporary restraining order immediately after the February 8, 2011 meeting recessed, when\n\nthe sheriff asked Smith “to go out with him to show him what needed to be done, and Smith told\n\nhim that he could not because there was a restraining order against him on that deal.”\n\n        When the Reids learned about the 2011 resolution, they joined Edwards County as a third-\n\nparty defendant in the underlying lawsuit and challenged the validity of the resolution. On May\n\n19, 2012, Edwards County entered into an agreed judgment with the Reids wherein the County\n\nagreed that the February 8, 2011 resolution “was not intended to acquire any public rights in any\n\nroad spur off of County Road 330 as described in the resolution; and to the extent the resolution is\n\n\n3\n County Road 330 was previously assigned the number 204; the Reids do not concede, however, that the “Moore\nRanch” mentioned in the 1998 order is the same property as that currently located within the 640-acre tract.\n\n                                                    -6-\n\f                                                                                                  04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nalleged to be an act acquiring or attempting to acquire public rights in the spur under Chapters [sic]\n\n281 or Chapter 258 of the Texas Transportation Code,” the resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. Further, the County agreed that “the Resolution specifically withheld the addition of the\n\nspur as a county road on the County’s Texas Transportation Code Chapter 258 County Road Map.”\n\nFinally, the County agreed that it “made no effort to comply with the notice and other procedures\n\nrequired by Chapters 281 and 258 of the Texas Transportation Code.” By entry of the agreed\n\njudgment, the Reids nonsuited the County. The County, therefore, did not participate in the\n\nunderlying trial, and stipulated that it would agree to be bound by the trial court’s judgment.\n\n        In May 2011, the Reids amended their petition to add an allegation related to a small, 1.165-\n\nacre piece of land located near the southern boundary of Reid Ranch and the northern boundary of\n\nSmith’s 640-acre tract. The 1.165-acre tract of land has been referred to throughout this litigation\n\nas the “bubble.” The “bubble” contains a natural spring that was fenced in to avoid washouts. The\n\nReids’ new claim alleged prior owners of the two ranches had agreed the “bubble” was a part of\n\nthe Reid Ranch and that future owners would not claim the “bubble” by adverse possession. Smith\n\nfiled an answer asserting the affirmative defenses of easement by estoppel, adverse possession,\n\nand impermissible collateral attack.\n\n        After multiple summary judgment motions were denied, the case proceeded to a bench trial\n\non March 26, 2013. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated on the record that: there is no record access,\n\neasements, or agreements across the Reid tracts in favor of the Smith tracts; and there are no\n\nrecorded dedications, purchases, condemnation, or final judgment of adverse possession in favor\n\nof the public as to any portion of the Reid Ranch as it relates to the spur road. 4 The trial court\n\nheard testimony from multiple witnesses and admitted documentary evidence. Following the\n\n\n4\n The parties further stipulated that Smith abandoned his claim that the spur road is a public road by virtue of the\ndoctrine of implied dedication and his claim of easement by necessity across the Reid property.\n\n                                                       -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nbench trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the Reids, finding that: the spur road is not a public\n\nroad; the spur road is not an easement appurtenant to the Smith tract; the Cloudt Deed creates a\n\ncloud upon the Reids’ title to the sixth and third tracts (i.e., the “bubble”); Smith claimed the\n\nbubble by adverse possession; the claim by Smith to adverse possession of the bubble was a breach\n\nof an express covenant not to so claim the land by adverse possession; and the Reids are entitled\n\nto enforce the terms of the express covenant not to claim the land by adverse possession. The trial\n\ncourt therefore ordered that the parties are authorized to place boundary fences and that the Reids\n\nare granted a permanent injunction against Smith prohibiting him from utilizing any portion of the\n\nReid Ranch to access the Smith Ranch. The trial court also awarded the Reids court costs and\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $79,171.30 for trial and $20,000 for appeal. The trial court signed\n\ntwo sets of findings of fact conclusions of law in support of its judgment.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n       On appeal, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that the spur road is not\n\na public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3) determining\n\nthat Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees to the Reids.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       In an appeal from a judgment rendered after a bench trial, the trial court’s findings of fact\n\nhave the same weight as a jury’s verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence used to support them, just as we would review a jury’s findings.

Smith further argues that the Reids cannot collaterally\n\nattack the commissioners’ actions, such that the 2012 agreed judgment between the Reids and\n\nEdwards County does not nullify the 2011 resolution. The Reids respond that the spur road is not\n\na public road because the County failed to utilize any of the statutorily-authorized methods of\n\nacquiring the spur as public, and because the County clarified by way of a November 10, 1986\n\norder that the spur is not a public road by omitting it from its official list of county roads.\n\n       Chapter 281 of the Texas Transportation Code sets out four methods by which a county\n\nwith a population of 50,000 or less, such as Edwards County, may acquire a public interest in a\n\nprivate road. Under section 281.002, a county may acquire a public interest in a private road only\n\nby: (1) purchase; (2) condemnation; (3) dedication; or (4) a court’s final judgment of adverse\n\npossession. See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. § 281.002 (West 2013). A public interest in a private\n\nroad may not be asserted until the commissioners’ court has complied with the resolution\n\nrequirement of section 281.005 and provided written notice to the owner of the road. Id.\n\n§§ 281.005-.006 (West 2013); see also id. § 258.002 (West 2013) (outlining procedures for\n\nadoption of county road map). It is undisputed that Edwards County did not comply with any of\n\nthe statutorily-authorized methods of road creation as it relates to the spur road in either 2011 or\n\n1998. Most notably, the County failed to comply with the notice provisions. Actions by a\n\ncommissioners’ court may be declared void for failure to comply with statutory requirements. See\n\nJohnson v.

Lawrence Reid testified that, prior to filing the lawsuit at issue,\n\nneither he nor any other member of his family was notified that Edwards County was\n\ncontemplating the status of the road. He further stated that they never received any notice from\n\nthe County with respect to the spur road, meaning that the Reids had no notice of the 1970s\n\ncommissioners’ statements or the 1998 order or the 2011 resolution. Jennifer Reid Smith testified\n\nsimilarly. The trial court was free to consider the evidence that no notice was provided to the\n\nReids before designating the spur road as a county road, as well as the fact that the spur road was\n\nnever added to the official county road map, 5 in concluding that the spur road is in fact a private\n\nroad.\n\n         In addition, the trial court was free to consider the 2012 agreed judgment memorializing\n\nan agreement between the County and the Reids in which the County disavowed any interest the\n\npublic might have in the spur road and agreed that the 2011 resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. The agreed judgment leaves no doubt that the County did not intend to acquire any\n\npublic rights in the spur road. We also note that the 2011 resolution relied on the 1978 statement\n\nof former commissioner Marshall Craig and the “mid-1970s” verbal statement of current\n\ncommissioner Lee Sweeten in finding that the spur road is a county road. Because individual\n\nmembers of the commissioners’ court have no authority to bind the county by their separate\n\nactions, these statements do not constitute conclusive proof that the spur road is a public road.

Hanks, 74 S.W.3d at 410-11. The appellate court recited the general rule that “absent a showing of gross\nabuse of discretion, fraud or collusion in the commissioners’ court’s opening of a road, the order of the commissioners’\ncourt is binding and conclusive” and the judgment is not subject to collateral attack. Id. at 412. The appellate court\ntherefore held that the order of the commissioners’ court reaffirming that the road was a county road was conclusive\nevidence on the issue of the status of the road, and that the trial court therefore erred in finding that the road was\nprivate. Id. The court went on, however, to note that a subsequent order of the commissioners’ court “released all\nclaim” the County had in the road, thereby abandoning the road. Id. Thus, the appellate court ultimately affirmed the\ntrial court’s declaration that the road was private. Id. at 414.

It is further uncontested that\n\nSmith’s use of the road across the Reids’ property was always permissive, up until the time he\n\npurchased the 81-acre tract. The Reids made no misrepresentation, nor did they engage in\n\noverreaching conduct by their silence; they had no duty to speak. See Wilson v.

Accordingly, Smith has failed to establish any of the elements of an easement by\n\nestoppel and we therefore overrule his second issue.\n\nBreach of Covenant Not to Adversely Possess the “Bubble”\n\n       Smith took title to his 640-acre tract subject to a covenant not to claim the Reids’ land by\n\nadverse possession. The Reids’ and Smith’s predecessors in title executed the agreement because\n\nthe terrain of their ranches required the fence-line to deviate from the true boundary line in several\n\nplaces, and neither wanted the deviation to turn into a claim of adverse possession. The Reids’\n\npredecessor in title, R.T. Craig, and Smith’s predecessor in title, J.A. Blalack, struck the following\n\nagreement:\n\n       WHEREAS, it was and is the intention of said parties to claim their respective lands\n       according to survey lines and according to the description contained in the several\n       deeds of conveyance under which said parties own and possess said respective\n       lands and not to claim said lands as differently divided by the division fence\n       between said parties as above shown . . . .\n\n       WHEREAS, said parties desire to evidence in writing said arrangement and to show\n       that they did not and do not intend to claim and possess said premises adversely to\n       each other:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That we, R.T.\n       Craig and J.A. Blalack, in consideration of the premises, hereby mutually agree that\n       we do not claim adversely to each other . . . J.A. Blalack for himself likewise\n       contracts and agrees to and with the said R.T. Craig that he, the said J.A. Blalack\n       has not claimed . . . the said portion of the South West one-fourth of Survey 50\n       which is cut into the outside inclosure [of] the said J.A. Blalack and further likewise\n       agrees that he does not and will not claim or assert any interest or title therein but\n       holds said premises subject to the claim and ownership of the said R.T. Craig and\n       the said parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.\n\nThe Reids pleaded that Smith’s deed, which contained a “bubble” of land within their boundary,\n\nconstituted a cloud on their title and constituted a breach of the covenant not to adversely possess.\n\nIn the final judgment, the trial court found that “Smith claimed such ‘bubble’ by virtue of adverse\n\npossession” and that assertion of this claim is “in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nclaim land . . . by adverse possession.” On appeal, Smith asserts that this finding is not supported\n\nby legally or factually sufficient evidence.\n\n         First, Smith argues that the Reids’ breach of covenant claim is barred by a four-year statute\n\nof limitations. See Malmgren v. Inverness Forest Residents Civic Club, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1759855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1759855/malmgren-v-inverness-forest-residents-civic-club-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (“Actions to enforce restrictive covenants are\n\ncontrolled by the four-year statute of limitations.”). The Reids respond that Smith has waived his\n\naffirmative defense of limitations because he failed to plead or argue it below. Smith’s “Fourth\n\nAmended Original Answer, Counter-Claim and Affirmative Defenses,” contains a section titled\n\n“Claims/Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading are two claims/affirmative defenses: (A)\n\nEasement by Estoppel and (B) Adverse Possession. The “adverse possession” heading contains\n\nthe following language:\n\n                 The Defendant, relying on his own deed from D.L. Cloudt in 2003, claims\n         ownership of “the bubble,” which lies at the entrance to the Smith tract, further\n         states that Plaintiffs’ alleged cause of action is barred by limitations set forth in\n         Sections 16.024, 16.025[,] and 16.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n         Code. The deed to Smith dated May 2003 is recorded in Volume 212, Page 821 of\n         the Edwards County deed records.\n\n                Moreover, “the bubble” was conveyed to Smith’s predecessor, Denman L.\n         Cloudt (“Cloudt”) by Deed dated November 16, 1998, recorded at Volume 161,\n         Page 364 of the Edwards County deed records. “The bubble” is described by metes\n         and bounds in the Deed to Cloudt. “The bubble” has been under fence and\n         considered part of what is the Smith Ranch since the 1970’s, prior to both Cloudt\n         and Smith’s ownership.\n\n(Emphasis added). 8 Sections 16.024-.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code pertain\n\nto adverse possession; none of the sections contain a four-year limitations period. See TEX. CIV.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  The pleading also contains a second section titled “Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading, four affirmative\ndefenses are listed as follows: “(A) Estoppel; (B) Estoppel / Silence / Duty to Speak; (C) Adverse Possession; and (D)\nImpermissible Collateral Attack.” There is no mention of the term “limitations” within the discussion of these\naffirmative defenses.\n\n                                                        - 16 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 16.024-.026 (West 2002) (providing three, five, and ten-year\n\nlimitations period for adverse possession claims).\n\n       We agree that Smith’s pleadings, which only briefly mention limitations under the adverse\n\npossession heading, failed to put the Reids on notice that he was claiming a limitations defense.\n\nSee TEX. R. CIV. P. 45, 47. A review of Smith’s live pleading would not have provided notice to\n\na reasonably competent attorney of Smith’s intent to assert the affirmative defense of limitations.\n\nSee Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v.

Smith contends\n\nthat absent the Reids’ failure to specially except to his pleading, his pleading is sufficient and he\n\ndid not waive his affirmative defense of limitations.

See Auld, 34 S.W.3d at 896 (stating an opposing party\n\nshould use special exceptions to identify defects in a pleading so that they may be cured, if\n\npossible, by amendment). The Reids were entitled to rely on Smith’s specific pleading of “adverse\n\npossession,” and were not required to alert Smith to another possible theory of recovery. See\n\nItalian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895311\"><a href=\"/opinion/895311/italian-cowboy-partners-ltd-v-prudential-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345 (Tex. 2011) (“A\n\nparty is not required to specially except to a pleading defect if it lacks notice of the other party’s\n\nintent.”). Because limitations is an affirmative defense that is waived unless affirmatively pleaded,\n\nSmith has failed to preserve his limitations complaint for our review. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 94; Fed.\n\nDeposit Ins. Corp. v.

The Craig-Blalock agreement provides\n\nthat the “parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.” Because the\n\noriginal parties to the agreement intended it to be binding upon their heirs and assigns, the covenant\n\nruns with the land.

App.—Eastland 2006, no pet.) (intent to run with\n\nthe land may be evidenced by language stating that covenant binds drafters’ “successors and\n\nassigns”). As such, Smith was bound by the covenant not to adversely possess the bubble.\n\n       Third, Smith argues the trial court’s negative finding as to adverse possession precludes a\n\nfinding of breach of covenant. This argument is disingenuous, because the agreement merely\n\nprohibits a “claim” or assertion of interest in the property—it is immaterial that the claim of\n\nadverse possession turns out to be unmeritorious or unsuccessful. We therefore cannot agree that\n\nthe trial court erred in finding that Smith claimed the “bubble” by adverse possession and that\n\nassertion of this claim constituted a breach of an express covenant. We overrule Smith’s issue\n\nrelated to breach of the covenant not to adversely possess the “bubble.”\n\nAttorney’s Fees\n\n       It is undisputed that the Reids sought recovery of attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 (breach\n\nof the covenant), under Chapter 37 (the Declaratory Judgments Act), and under common law. As\n\nto attorney’s fees, the trial court’s judgment provides:\n\n       Under the discretionary powers of the Court to award attorneys fees under Chapter\n       38 of the Texas Civil Practices [sic] and Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded\n       attorneys fees against the Defendant, Randy K. Smith[,] through the trial in the\n       amount of $79,171.30, and are conditionally awarded attorney fees against\n       Defendant, Randy K. Smith[,] in the event that the Defendant Smith appeals this\n       matter to the 4th Court of Appeals in the amount of $20,000.\n\nOn appeal, Smith asks that we vacate the award of attorney’s fees. Smith claims: (1) the trial court\n\nawarded attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code; and (2)\n\nthe Reids did not succeed on any Chapter 38 claims. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f                                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n§ 38.001 (West 2008). 9 We disagree with Smith’s narrow reading of the judgment, and hold that\n\nthe trial court’s judgment awards attorney’s fees based on both the Chapter 38 claim and the Reids’\n\nChapter 37 claims for declaratory relief. We further hold the Reids’ successful breach of covenant\n\nclaim is equivalent to a Chapter 38 breach of contract claim.\n\n         With regard to whether the Reids are entitled to recover attorney’s fees under Chapter 38,\n\nSmith argues that the Reids did not succeed on any Chapter 38 claims.

CODE ANN. § 15.51 (West 2011) (“Procedures and Remedies in Actions\nto Enforce Covenants Not to Compete”).\n\n                                                        - 20 -\n\f                                                                                                         04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n           Section 37.009 of the Declaratory Judgments Act provides: “In any proceeding under this\n\nchapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable\n\nand just.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.009 (West 2008). The Act imposes four\n\nlimitations on the trial court’s discretion in deciding whether to award attorney fees or not.\n\nBocquet v. Herring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441412\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441412/bocquet-v-herring/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (Tex. 1998). Id. First, the factfinder must determine that\n\nthe fees are reasonable. Id. Second, the factfinder must determine that the fees are necessary. Id.\n\nThe remaining limitations on attorney fees awards are that they must be equitable and just. Id.\n\nSuch matters are determined by the trial court, in its discretion, as a matter of law. Id.\n\n           Here, the trial court, as factfinder, found that the fees were reasonable and necessary. It\n\nalso concluded that the award of fees was equitable and just. The trial court thus made the findings\n\nand legal determinations necessary to support an award of attorney’s fees under the Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act.           See id.     Accordingly, when reading the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law in conjunction with the judgment, we conclude that the trial court’s award of\n                                                                                                              11\nattorney’s fees was also based on the Reids’ successful claims for declaratory judgment.\n\n           Finally, we address Smith’s alternate complaint that the amount of attorney’s fees awarded\n\ndoes not comport with the evidence of segregation of fees. At trial, counsel for the Reids testified\n\nthat the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred in prosecuting the Reids’ case through\n\ntrial was $87,613.30, and supported this figure with itemized invoices. Evidence was also\n\nintroduced that appellate attorney’s fees would amount to $20,000. The Reids’ counsel further\n\ntestified that he spent 10% of his time on the adverse possession claim; 30% on the abandoned\n\nclaims of easement by necessity and public road by implied dedication; 30% on the 2011\n\nresolution; and 30% on the temporary restraining order, request for declarations, and defending\n\n\n\n11\n     Smith does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award of attorney’s fees.\n\n                                                          - 21 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nthe easement by estoppel. In accordance with the evidence presented, the trial court found that\n\n$79,171.30 should be awarded as attorney’s fees through trial—a reduction of $8,442 in the\n\namount proved by the Reids—and $20,000 should be awarded on appeal.\n\n         Based on the testimony segregating the fees, Smith contends the Reids could only recover\n\nten percent of the total award of fees for their breach of contract claim. Although we agree the\n\naward must comport with the testimony segregating the fees, we hold that the Reids are entitled to\n\nthe corresponding percentage of time spent on both Chapter 38 and Chapter 37 claims.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the award of attorney’s fees should be limited to seventy percent of the\n\ntotal amount of fees incurred through trial, or $55,419.91. 12\n\n         We also agree with Smith that the award of appellate attorney’s fees should have been\n\nconditioned on Smith’s unsuccessful appeal to this court. Appellate attorney’s fees must be\n\nconditioned on success in the appeal. Gilbert v. City of El Paso, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276669\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276669/gilbert-v-city-of-el-paso/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337-38 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2010, no pet.). We therefore modify the judgment to make the award of appellate\n\nattorney’s fees contingent upon an unsuccessful appeal by Smith. See Sundance Minerals, L.P. v.\n\nMoore, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 (Tex.

As such, Smith’s final\n\nissue is sustained in part.\n\n                                                   CONCLUSION\n\n         The trial court’s judgment is modified to award $55,419.91 in attorney’s fees to the Reids\n\nbased on the breach of covenant claim and the claims for declaratory relief. Further, the award of\n\nappellate attorney’s fees to the Reids is conditioned on an unsuccessful appeal by Smith. With\n\nthese modifications, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n                                                            Rebeca C. Martinez, Justice\n\n12\n  All but thirty percent of counsel’s time was attributed to the claims for declaratory relief and the claim for breach\nof the covenant not to adversely possess. Counsel expressly testified that he spent thirty percent of his time on claims\nthat were “abandoned.” The award of attorney’s fees cannot be premised on abandoned claims.\n\n                                                         - 22 -\n\f</pre>",
