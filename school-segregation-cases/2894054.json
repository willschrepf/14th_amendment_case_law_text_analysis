He fled to the United States where he was\ndetained upon arrival. He applied for asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Tor-\nture. Twice, the government’s arguments against the grant of\nimmigration relief have been rejected and Nadarajah has been\nawarded relief by an immigration judge. This decision was\naffirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Yet, the gov-\nernment continues to detain Nadarajah, who has now been\nimprisoned for almost five years despite having prevailed at\nevery administrative level of review and who has never been\n\f3148                  NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\ncharged with any crime. We order that a writ of habeas corpus\nissue, and that he be released on appropriate conditions during\nthe pendency of any further proceedings.\n\n                                   I\n\n   This is a case about one individual, but as with most immi-\ngration cases, it can only be understood in the larger context\nof country conflict. The backdrop of this case is the quarter\ncentury-old battle between the government of Sri Lanki and\na group known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\n(“LTTE”) that seeks the creation of an independent state in\nareas in Sri Lanka inhabited by ethnic Tamils. The Tamils are\nan ethnic group who live in southern India and on Sri Lanka,\nan island of 19 million people off the southern tip of India.\nTamils comprise about 18 percent of the island’s population,\nand most live in its northern and eastern areas. Their Hindu\nreligion and Tamil language set them apart from the three-\nquarters of Sri Lankans who are Sinhalese—members of a\nlargely Buddhist, Sinhala-speaking ethnic group.\n\n   The LTTE separatist group, also known as the Tamil\nTigers, have used conventional, guerrilla, and terror tactics in\nthe decades-old civil war with the Sri Lankan government that\nhas claimed more than 60,000 lives and displaced hundreds of\nthousands of Sri Lankans. Based on its conflict with the Sri\nLankan government, the United State Department of State has\nlisted the LTTE as a foreign terrorist organization. After the\nterrorist attacks against the United States on September 11,\n2001, the LTTE declared a cease-fire against the Sri Lankan\ngovernment. In 2002, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan govern-\nment signed a formal cease-fire accord. The cease-fire\nremains in effect; however, there have been outbreaks of spo-\nradic violence in the area.\n\n  Ahilan Nadarajah is a 25 year old native and citizen of Sri\nLanka.1 He is a member of the Tamil ethnic minority. Nadara-\n  1\n   Because the Immigration Judge and the BIA found Nadarajah credible,\nwe assume for purposes of this Opinion that the following facts are true\nbased on his testimony in the asylum hearings.\n\f                   NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                 3149\njah lived with his family in the Jaffna peninsula at the north\nof Sri Lanka. He finished his schooling at age 17, and was\nworking as a farmer on land that his family owned. In 1995,\nthe Sri Lankan army invaded and shelled the area, displacing\nhis family to the town of Vanni, some 60 kilometers from\nJaffna. While they were leaving Jaffna by bicycle, one of the\nshells hit and killed Nadarajah’s older brother. Eighteen\nmonths later, in April of 1997, his family returned to Jaffna,\nbut because their home was occupied by the Sri Lankan army,\nthey stayed with an aunt, two kilometers away.\n\n   Shortly thereafter, Nadarajah first had problems with the\nSri Lankan army. On May 22, 1997, around 4:30 a.m., six or\nseven soldiers came into the home, beat him, blindfolded him,\nand took him to their camp. Because he had been in Vanni,\nhis attackers accused him of membership in the LTTE, which\nhe denied. For four months, Nadarajah was kept in the army\ncamp, where he was regularly questioned and tortured. His\nquestioners asked him to admit LTTE membership; when he\nrefused, they tortured him, with methods that included beating\nhim, sometimes with boards and gun handles, hanging him\nupside down, pricking his toenails with needles and burning\nhim with cigarette butts. He still bears the scars from those\ntorture sessions. He was eventually released when his mother\nbribed an army commander.\n\n   On October 5, 2000, Nadarajah was again arrested in his\nhome, this time by agents of the opposition Elam People’s\nDemocratic Party (“EPDP”). When he denied their accusa-\ntions of LTTE membership, he was beaten and taken to an\nEPDP camp. Nadarajah testified that the EPDP camp was\nfunded by and connected to the Sri Lankan government. For\na month, he was beaten and locked inside “a dark, dirty\nroom,” and forced to do menial labor. After a month of his\nmother’s begging, he was permitted to leave the camp in\nNovember of 2000, but required to report every morning for\ntwo months.\n\f3150                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n   Nadarajah was again arrested, by the Sri Lankan army, on\nJuly 10, 2001. A group of 15 to 20 soldiers approached him\nand his brother while they were working in a garden and took\nthem into custody. Although his brother was soon released\nbecause of poor health, Nadarajah was detained for a month,\nduring which he was again tortured:\n\n    Q.   In what ways did they abuse you?\n\n    A. They hung me upside down and they beat me.\n    While hanging upside down they brought a bag of\n    gasoline, put my head inside that bag and tied me. *\n    * * About 30 to 40 seconds I fainted. When I opened\n    my eyes I was in my room. * * * They [also] tied my\n    toes together and one person will pull one side and\n    the others, the other person will pull it. And the other\n    person pulled my head. They would fill the plastic\n    bag with sand and they will beat me with that. * *\n    * [And t]hey burned me with cigarette butts.\n\n   Nadarajah was released when his mother again bribed an\nofficial. He was told it was the last time he would be released\nand he ought to leave the country. Accompanied and funded\nby an uncle, Nadarajah departed immediately for Colombo,\nwith plans to go to Canada.\n\n   In October of 2001, Nadarajah left Sri Lanka, having\nobtained a passport and exit documents through a smuggler.\nHe traveled through Thailand, South Africa, Brazil and then\nMexico before reaching the United States on October 27,\n2001. He was apprehended by U.S. immigration officials at\nthe border, and has been detained since.\n\n   On November 9, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\nService granted Nadarajah parole from custody, conditioned,\ninter alia, on payment of a $20,000 bond. Unable to pay the\nbond, Nadarajah remained in custody. Nadarajah requested\nthat the bond amount be decreased on at least three occasions,\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                 3151\nbut these requests were denied. On August 9, 2004, counsel\nfor Nadarajah attempted to present $20,000 to secure his\nparole under the 2001 terms. However, the United States\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)\nwas “unwilling to accept the bond, stating that the previous\norder granting Mr. Nadarajah parole was ‘stale’ and ICE\ncould not honor it.”\n\n   In November of 2001, removal proceedings began against\nNadarajah. He conceded removability and applied for asylum\nand other relief, claiming past persecution and fear of future\npersecution on account of his ethnicity and imputed political\nopinion. The government obtained two continuances; not until\nApril 21, 2003, was a hearing held at which Nadarajah testi-\nfied. The government opposed Nadarajah’s asylum applica-\ntion on the grounds that he was affiliated with the LTTE, an\nallegation supported by the affidavit of an ICE agent who had\nreceived information from a confidential informant.\n\n   Despite the government’s allegations and “some discrepan-\ncies” in Nadarajah’s testimony, the immigration judge (“IJ”)\nfound Nadarajah credible, noting that his testimony was con-\nsistent and supportive of his asylum claim. The IJ granted\nasylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n   On April 25, 2003, the government filed a motion to re-\nopen the removal proceedings to introduce additional evi-\ndence, namely, to present the testimony of a Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”) agent. The IJ denied the motion,\nand the government appealed to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (“BIA” or “Board”). The BIA granted the motion to\nreopen and remanded to the IJ. In its remand order, the BIA\ninstructed the IJ to hear evidence in the form of testimony by\nthe DHS witness, special agent Schultz, even though the IJ\nhad given the DHS two postponements in order to present its\nwitness without the witness appearing.\n\n  Proceedings were held on June 8 and August 18, 2004.\nAgent Schultz testified, as well as Nadarajah’s expert witness.\n\f3152                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\nSchultz testified that his knowledge of the matter came from\nresearch that “involved reviewing public information that was\navailable on the [LTTE] from State Department reports,\nAmnesty International reports[, speaking] to people in the\nCanadian government that were considered experts on the\nground, and [speaking to] an ass[e]t of the Royal Canadian\nMounted Police who is an expert regarding the group.” When\nasked about the reliability of his Canadian sources, Schultz\nreplied that he “had no reason to question their reliability. So\n[he] assumed that everything they told [him] was true.” His\nfaith in his sources was buttressed when he received “an\nanonymous letter that [he] believe[d] was postmarked in Cali-\nfornia[, and a] lot of the information in that anonymous letter\nwas the same as the information that [he] had received from\nthe Canadian officials.” According to the informant, the area\nof Jaffna where Nadarajah lived was LTTE controlled, and it\nwould have been impossible for him to exit the area without\nthe approval and assistance of the LTTE. Therefore, con-\ncluded Schultz, Nadarajah must have been at least affiliated\nwith the LTTE.\n\n  Schultz also investigated the 20 Tamils smuggled with\nNadarajah. Schultz read the statements of all of the aliens, and\nconcluded that, in all 21 cases, “almost the entire declaration\nwas rehearsed [and coached], because they were so similar”:\n\n    I read their declarations, and I read the I-213s, and\n    they were all very similar, which led me to believe\n    that they were coached. Also, considering the fact\n    that they’re from the same general part of the world,\n    they all entered within a few days of each other, all\n    in the same general area, and came up with the same\n    almost exact story as far as their background and\n    their routes of travel, it appeared to me that they had\n    been coached.\n\n  In addition, since the first hearing, the informant had told\nSchultz of a May 2003, telephone call that Nadarajah had\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                     3153\nmade, along with a female detainee and LTTE member named\nSatchithananthan held at the same facility, to order that some-\none in Canada be killed.\n\n  On cross-examination, when asked how Nadarajah and\nSatchithananthan could have made the call “together” at the\ngender-segregated detention facility, Schultz responded:\n\n    I could only say that’s what I wrote. I mean I, I don’t\n    know. And I didn’t say that I knew. I didn’t say it\n    was one telephone call. I said both of these individu-\n    als placed a telephone call to Toronto. * * * So it\n    could have been on different days, it could have been\n    at different times.\n\nSchultz had no answer as to why he had not attempted to\nmonitor the telephones at the facility, or even subpoena the\nphone records.\n\n   Nadarajah’s expert, Robert Oberst, is a professor of politi-\ncal science and specialist in South Asian politics at Nebraska\nWesleyan University. He has served as an advisor to the\nUnited States government in various capacities, has published\nat least 75 articles on Sri Lanka, as well as four books (includ-\ning the most widely used textbook on South Asia) and has\nspent a total of at least three to four years living in Sri Lanka,\nmost recently in 2003, when he spent nine months in the\ncountry. Oberst testified that, in his research, he is very skep-\ntical of informants’ claimed identities, and often disbelieves\nhis purported informants. In his opinion, it was unlikely that\nthe LTTE would smuggle individuals out of Colombo, an area\ncontrolled by the Sri Lankan army. Further, Oberst testified\nthat the area of Jaffna where Nadarajah lived was under Sri\nLankan army control, and there was a military base near his\naunt’s house. As a result, in Oberst’s opinion, it was highly\nunlikely that the LTTE would be in any way involved in\nsmuggling a Tamil person out of this area.\n\f3154                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n   After assessing the new evidence, the IJ concluded that\n“this Court finds nothing of significance which would seri-\nously alter the Court’s original finding.” The IJ therefore rein-\nstated his prior order granting Nadarajah asylum.\n\n  After the IJ’s second decision granting asylum, Nadarajah’s\ncounsel submitted letters dated September 3 and 8, 2004,\nagain requesting parole. These requests were denied by San\nDiego ICE Field Office Director Ronald Smith on September\n20, 2004, pursuant to an August 13, 2004, determination by\nICE that Nadarajah “no longer m[et] the criteria for a bond.”\n\n   After the IJ’s second opinion and after his request for\nparole was denied, Nadarajah filed his habeas petition with\nthe District Court for the Southern District of California.\nMore than one year after he filed the petition, it was denied\nby the district court. This timely appeal followed.\n\n   Subsequently, on January 5, 2006, the BIA affirmed the\nIJ’s second opinion granting Nadarajah relief. The BIA dis-\nmissed the appeal and ordered the record remanded to the IJ\n“for the purpose of allowing [DHS] the opportunity to com-\nplete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investi-\ngations or examinations, and further proceedings, if\nnecessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8\nC.F.R. § 1003.47(h).” (citing Background and Security Inves-\ntigations in Proceedings Before the Immigration Judges and\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals, 70 Fed. Reg. 4743, 4752-\n54 (Jan 31, 2005)). The next day, in an unusual move, the\nBIA Chairperson referred the case to the Attorney General for\nreview, “seek[ing] guidance from the Attorney General on\nwhether he wishes to exercise his discretion and de novo\nreview authority in this case of national interest where the\nBoard applied the standard of review required by 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.1(d)(3).” The BIA did not provide for Nadarajah’s\nrelease from detention, where he remains without any estab-\nlished timeline for a decision on when he may be released\nfrom detention.\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                  3155\n   This appeal is confined to the district court’s denial of the\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus and the agency’s denial\nof parole. We review the district court’s decision to grant or\ndeny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 2241 de novo. Singh v. Ashcroft, 351 F.3d 435,\n438 (9th Cir. 2003). We review the decision to deny parole\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) for abuse of discretion, and\nthe agency’s parole decision will be upheld if supported by a\n“facially legitimate and bona fide reason.” Jean v. Nelson,\n472 U.S. 846, 853 (1985) (quoting Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408\nU.S. 753, 770 (1972)).\n\n                               II\n\n   [1] Although neither party has raised the question of juris-\ndiction, we are obligated to consider it sua sponte. Justices of\nBoston Mun. Court v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, 300-02 (1984).\nThe district court asserted habeas corpus jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2241. On May 11, 2005, Congress enacted the\nREAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231,\n310-11 (amending 8 U.S.C. § 1252). The REAL ID Act\namends the Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub. L. No. 82-\n414, 66 Stat. 163 (June 27, 1952), by eliminating federal\nhabeas corpus jurisdiction over final orders of removal in\nfavor of petitions for review that raise “constitutional claims\nor questions of law.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (as amended by\nREAL ID Act § 106(a)(2)). However, this provision only\napplies to federal habeas corpus jurisdiction over “final orders\nof removal.” Id. By its terms, the jurisdiction-stripping provi-\nsion does not apply to federal habeas corpus petitions that do\nnot involve final orders of removal. Here, as we have noted,\nthere is no final order of removal. To the contrary, Nadarajah\nhas prevailed at every administrative level. Therefore, in cases\nthat do not involve a final order of removal, federal habeas\ncorpus jurisdiction remains in the district court, and on appeal\nto this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\f3156                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n                               III\n\n   Nadarajah challenges his confinement on statutory and con-\nstitutional grounds. “[P]rior to reaching any constitutional\nquestions, federal courts must consider nonconstitutional\ngrounds for decision.” Gulf Oil Co v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89,\n99 (1981). Therefore, we must first examine whether the gov-\nernment has the statutory authority to detain Nadarajah indefi-\nnitely. See Ma v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1095, 1104 (9th Cir.\n2001) (as amended) (“[W]e must first determine whether\nCongress provided the INS with the authority to detain [the\nalien petitioner] indefinitely, as the Attorney General con-\ntends.”).\n\n   In construing the applicable statutes, we are governed by\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance, which requires a statute\nto be construed so as to avoid serious doubts as to the consti-\ntutionality of an alternate construction. INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU.S. 289, 299-300 (2001) (“[I]f an otherwise acceptable con-\nstruction of a statute would raise serious constitutional prob-\nlems, and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is\n‘fairly possible,’ we are obligated to construe the statute to\navoid such problems.”).\n\n   In addition, “[i]n ascertaining the plain meaning of the stat-\nute, the court must look to the particular statutory language at\nissue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a\nwhole.” K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291\n(1988) (citations omitted).\n\n                               A\n\n   The DHS claims the authority to detain Nadarajah indefi-\nnitely under the general immigration detention statutes: 8\nU.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) and (b)(2)(A). The former statute\nprovides:\n\n    If the [asylum] officer determines at the time of the\n    interview [upon arrival in the United States] that an\n\f                        NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                       3157\n      alien has a credible fear of persecution . . . , the alien\n      shall be detained for further consideration of the\n      application for asylum.\n\nAnd the latter:\n\n      [I]n the case of an alien who is an applicant for\n      admission, if the examining immigration officer\n      determines that an alien seeking admission is not\n      clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,\n      the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under 8\n      U.S.C. § 1229a.\n\n   [2] These general detention statutes do not authorize\nNadarajah’s indefinite detention. In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533\nU.S. 678 (2001), the Supreme Court addressed the legality of\ndetention of aliens who had been ordered removed under 8\nU.S.C. § 1231(a)(6).2 Reasoning that “[a] statute permitting\nindefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitu-\ntional problem,” and that Congress cannot authorize indefinite\ndetention in the absence of a clear statement, the Court con-\nstrued the statute to permit detention only while removal\nremained reasonably foreseeable. Id. at 690, 699. After a pre-\nsumptively reasonable six-month detention, “once the alien\nprovides good reason to believe that there is no significant\nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the\nGovernment must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut\nthat showing.” Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.\n\n  [3] Although Zadvydas dealt with the detention of aliens\n  2\n   8 U.S.C. §1231(a)(6) provides:\n      An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C.\n      § 1182, removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C), (a)(2), or\n      (a)(4) or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be\n      a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of\n      removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if\n      released, shall be subject to . . . terms of supervision.\n\f3158                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\nwho had been admitted to the United States, see 533 U.S. at\n682, and construed a different statute, that case and its prog-\neny remain instructive. In Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371\n(2005), the Court held that Zadvydas applied to all categories\nof aliens whose detention was authorized by 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1231(a)(6), including “those ordered removed who are inad-\nmissible,” because the phrase “may be detained beyond the\nremoval period” had to be interpreted the same way in each\ncase encompassed by the statute. Id. At 377, 378.\n\n   The Clark Court did not decide that the indefinite detention\nof inadmissible aliens presented the same constitutional prob-\nlems in the same degree as the detention of admissible aliens.\n543 U.S. at 380. To the contrary, the Court relied on the stat-\nute’s applicability to admitted aliens and the necessity of con-\nsistent interpretation:\n\n    The Government . . . argues that the statutory pur-\n    pose and the constitutional concerns that influenced\n    our statutory construction in Zadvydas are not pres-\n    ent for aliens . . . who have not been admitted to the\n    United States. Be that as it may, it cannot justify giv-\n    ing the same detention provision a different meaning\n    when such aliens are involved. It is not at all unusual\n    to give a statute’s ambiguous language a limiting\n    construction called for by one of the statute’s appli-\n    cations, even though other of the statute’s applica-\n    tions, standing alone, would not support the same\n    limitation. * * * [W]hen deciding which of two plau-\n    sible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must\n    consider the natural consequences of its choice. If\n    one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional\n    problems, the other should prevail—whether or not\n    those constitutional problems pertain to the particu-\n    lar litigant before the Court.\n\nId. at. 380-81.\n\f                        NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                         3159\n   The statutes cited by the government, 8 U.S.C.\n§§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) and (b)(2)(A), apply to any alien an\nimmigration officer determines to be inadmissible and to have\na credible fear of persecution, and, in the case of\n§ 1225(b)(2)(A), any alien the immigration officer determines\nnot to be “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.”3\nTherefore, although the Zadvydas Court referred to terrorism\nas the kind of issue that might permit extended detention, see\n533 U.S. at 691 (internal quotation marks omitted) (“The pro-\nvision authorizing detention does not apply narrowly to a\nsmall segment of particularly dangerous individuals, say sus-\npected terrorists, but broadly to aliens ordered removed.”); id.\nat 696 (“Neither do we consider terrorism or other special cir-\ncumstances where special arguments might be made for forms\nof preventive detention and for heightened deference to the\njudgments of the political branches with respects to matters of\nnational security.”), because these statutes are not limited to\nsuch applications, they cannot be read to authorize the indefi-\nnite detention of supposed terrorists but only the brief deten-\ntion of all others. This interpretation would abrogate the\nholding and reasoning in Clark by treating some detentions\nauthorized by the same statute differently, depending on the\nidentity and status of the detainee.\n\n   In addition, the Supreme Court has held that the existence\nof statutes authorizing the detention of suspected terrorists\nspecifically precludes the use of general detention statutes to\nauthorize the unlimited detention of terrorists. “The Court’s\ninterpretation of § 1231(a)(6) did not affect the detention of\nalien terrorists for the simple reason that sustained detention\nof alien terrorists is a ‘special arrangement’ authorized by a\n  3\n    Some admissible aliens are likely detained pursuant to these provi-\nsions, particularly given § 1225(b)(2)(A)’s requirement that the admissi-\nbility be “clear[ ] and beyond [ ] doubt” according to the immigration\nofficer. This fact only brings the cases even closer to the Clark situation:\nif admitted aliens can only be detained for a reasonable period, and admis-\nsible aliens may be detained pursuant to this statutory provision, then the\nstatute can only authorize a limited detention. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 380.\n\f3160                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\ndifferent statutory provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1537(b)(2)(C).”\nClark, 543 U.S. at 379 n.4.\n\n   [4] In short, applying the Supreme Court’s statutory analy-\nsis to the instant case, we conclude that the general immigra-\ntion detention statutes do not authorize the Attorney General\nto incarcerate detainees for an indefinite period. Rather, con-\nsistent with the Supreme Court’s approach in Zadvydas, we\nconclude that the statutes at issue permit detention only while\nremoval remains reasonably foreseeable. Further, consistent\nwith Zadvydas, we conclude that after a presumptively rea-\nsonable six-month detention, “once the alien provides good\nreason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of\nremoval in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government\nmust respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.”\nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.\n\n                               B\n\n   [5] Our conclusion that the general detention statutes can-\nnot be read as authorizing indefinite detention is bolstered by\nconsidering the immigration statutes as a whole. In fact, Con-\ngress has enacted provisions that allow the Attorney General\nto detain certain aliens for lengthy periods, but certain defined\ncategories of aliens, and only with procedural safeguards.\n\n   Specifically, the Patriot Act allows detention of suspected\nterrorists or other threats to national security, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1226a and 8 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1537. However, in order to\neffect such lengthy detentions, the Attorney General is\nrequired to certify that the statutory criteria has been met, and\nthe Attorney General must review the certifications every six\nmonths. Section 1226a contains the Patriot Act’s authoriza-\ntion of detention of suspected terrorists, providing that “the\nAttorney General shall take into custody any alien who is cer-\ntified” by the Attorney General where it is known or there are\nreasonable grounds to believe:\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                     3161\n    •   the alien comes to the United States to engage in\n        espionage or sabotage, § 1182(a)(3)(A)(i)(I);\n        § 1227(a)(4)(A)(i);\n\n    •   the alien comes to the United States to violate\n        U.S. law relating to the export of goods, technol-\n        ogy or sensitive information, § 1182(a)(3)(A)\n        (i)(II); § 1227(a)(4)(A)(i);\n\n    •   the alien comes to the United States to engage in\n        any activity with the purpose of opposing or\n        overthrowing the U.S. government, § 1182(a)(3)\n        (A)(iii); § 1227(a)(4)(A)(iii);\n\n    •   the alien has engaged in, is likely to engage\n        in, or to incite terrorist activity, or is or was a\n        member of a foreign terrorist organization.\n        § 1182(a)(3)(B); § 1127(a)(4)(B); § 1226a(a)(1);\n        § 1226a(a)(3).\n\n   The Attorney General may delegate the power to certify\nonly to the Deputy Attorney General, who may not in turn\ndelegate it. 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(4). An alien detained under\nthis section “whose removal is unlikely in the reasonably\nforeseeable future, may be detained for additional periods of\nup to six months only if the release of the alien will threaten\nthe national security of the United States or the safety of the\ncommunity or any person.” 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(6). The\nAttorney General is required to review certifications under\nthis section at six month intervals. 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(7).\n\n   Sections 1531-1537, enacted in 1996, establish the Alien\nTerrorist Removal Court and the procedures that it must fol-\nlow. Upon receipt of “classified information that an alien is\nan alien terrorist,” the Attorney General can file an applica-\ntion with the removal court and take the alien into custody. 8\nU.S.C. §§ 1533(a)(1), 1536(a)(1)(A). That application must\ncontain the Attorney General’s certification that the applica-\n\f3162                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\ntion satisfies the requirements of 8 U.S.C. § 1533, which\ninclude:\n\n    a statement of the facts and circumstances relied on\n    by the Department of Justice to establish probable\n    cause that (i) the alien is a terrorist; (ii) the alien is\n    physically present in the United States; and (iii) with\n    respect to such alien, [standard removal proceedings]\n    would pose a risk to the national security of the\n    United States.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1533(a)(1)(D).\n\n   [6] By their own terms, both statutory provisions for the\ndetention of suspected terrorists require that the Attorney\nGeneral “certify” the case before such detention begins. 8\nU.S.C. § 1226a; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1537. Nadarajah’s case has\nnot been so certified. In addition, the other procedural protec-\ntions of these statutes, including biannual reviews of certifica-\ntion, have not been conducted. 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(7).\nIndeed, the government does not claim that the detention pro-\nvisions for terrorists under the Patriot Act justify Nadarajah’s\ndetention. However, the existence of these provisions is\nimportant in the statutory construction of the general deten-\ntion statutes upon which the government relies. The govern-\nment’s argument ignores a basic principle of statutory\nconstruction, namely that the specific prevails over the gen-\neral. Bonneville Power Admin. v. FERC, 422 F.3d 908, 916\n(9th Cir. 2005) (citing Santiago Salgado v. Garcia, 384 F.3d\n769, 774 (9th Cir. 2004)). Given that Congress has placed\nspecific limits on the Attorney General’s authority to detain\nsuspected terrorists, those statutory provisions must govern\nsuch detentions, instead of the general detention provisions\nthat apply to all aliens coming into the United States.\n\n   Further, the structure of the immigration statutes, with spe-\ncific attention given to potential detentions of over six months\nin carefully defined categories, indicates that the period of\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                   3163\ndetention allowed under the general detention statutes must be\nconstrued as being brief and reasonable, as the Supreme Court\nhas determined in construing similar provisions.\n\n                               C\n\n   In sum, the government does not possess the authority\nunder the general detention statutes to hold Nadarajah, or any\nother alien who is similarly situated, indefinitely. Rather, con-\nsistent with the construction given by the Supreme Court to\nsimilar statutes, the detention must be for a reasonable period,\nand only if there is a “significant likelihood of removal in the\nreasonably foreseeable future. After a presumptively reason-\nable six-month detention, once the alien provides good reason\nto believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in\nthe reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must\nrespond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.” Zad-\nvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.\n\n                               IV\n\n   Applying the law to the facts of this case, we conclude that\na writ of habeas corpus must issue and Nadarajah must be\nreleased from custody. The length of the detention in this case\nhas been unreasonable. Nadarajah has established that there is\nno significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foresee-\nable future. The government has failed to respond with evi-\ndence sufficient to rebut that showing.\n\n                               A\n\n  [7] The nearly five-year detention in this case far exceeds\nboth any period of confinement found reasonable by the\nCourt, and the six-month period of presumptive reasonable-\nness.\n\n  Zadvydas and Clark used the six-month period as the\ntouchstone of reasonableness. In addition to its analysis in\n\f3164                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\nZadvydas and Clark, the Supreme Court has given further\nguidance as to what it considers to be a “reasonable” length\nof detention for aliens in Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510\n(2003). In Demore, the Supreme Court held that the govern-\nment could detain aliens who had been convicted of a crime\nfor “the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.”\nId. at 513. In Demore, the Court discussed the data concern-\ning detention length, noting that “[t]he Executive Office for\nImmigration Review has calculated that, in 85% of the cases\nin which aliens are detained pursuant to § 1226(c), removal\nproceedings are completed in an average time of 47 days, and\na median of 30 days.” 538 U.S. at 529. The Court noted that\n“[i]n the remaining 15% of cases, in which the alien appeals\nthe decision of the Immigration Judge to the Board of Immi-\ngration Appeals, appeal takes an average of four months, with\na median time that is slightly shorter.” Id. The Court noted\nthat Kim, the respondent, had been detained for over six\nmonths, which was “somewhat longer than the average.” Id.\nat 530-31. However, the Court viewed that “temporary” con-\nfinement as permissible.\n\n   Demore was decided in the context of an alien convicted of\na crime who was detained pending a determination of remov-\nability. Here, the IJ first determined that Nadarajah is entitled\nto relief in the forms of asylum and withholding of removal\nunder the Convention Against Torture, and on remand deter-\nmined again that Nadarajah is entitled to relief from removal\nin the form of asylum, which was affirmed by the BIA. Thus,\nNadarajah’s detention is more akin to the situation in Zadvy-\ndas, which was “indefinite” and “potentially permanent.” 533\nU.S. at 690-91. Nonetheless, Demore endorses the general\nproposition of “brief” detentions, with a specific holding of a\nsix-month period as presumptively reasonable.\n\n  [8] A detention of nearly five years—ten times the amount\nof time the Supreme Court has considered acceptable absent\na special showing—is plainly unreasonable under any mea-\nsure.\n\f                        NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                         3165\n   The government argues, both in its briefing and at oral\nargument, that Demore stands for an entirely different propo-\nsition: an indefinite period of detention. It reasons that:\n\n      [b]y referring to average and median, the Court did\n      not, as Nadarajah tries to infer, restrict either its\n      holding or its reasoning to those cases where deten-\n      tion falls within the average or median length of\n      time. Of necessity, by referring to average and\n      median detention times, the Court implicitly\n      acknowledged that there would be shorter than aver-\n      age and longer than average detentions, and its\n      approval of the average and median necessarily cov-\n      ers the short and long detentions that go into the\n      mathematical equation to determine average and\n      median.\n\n   In other words, the government is contending that by refer-\nencing EOIR’s detention statistics, which described the aver-\nage and median lengths of detention, the Court was adopting\na rule that a detention of any length was entirely permissible\nbecause—of mathematical necessity—lengthy detentions\nwould have to go into the calculation of the average and\nmedian times. This is a patently absurd reading of Demore. In\nDemore, the Court grounded its holding by referencing a\n“brief period,” id. at 513, 523, of “temporary confinement.”\nId. at 531. There is no indication anywhere in Demore that the\nCourt would countenance an indefinite detention.4\n  4\n    The references to the brevity and limited nature of the confinement are\nfound throughout Demore. See id. at 513 (“Congress . . . may require that\n[criminal aliens] be detained for the brief period necessary for their\nremoval proceedings.”); id. at 523 (“[R]espondent argued that the Govern-\nment may not . . . detain him for the brief period necessary for his removal\nproceedings.”); id. at 526 (noting the “Court’s longstanding view that the\nGovernment may . . . detain deportable aliens during the limited period\nnecessary for their removal proceedings”); id. at 529 n.12 (noting “[t]he\nvery limited time of the detention at stake”).\n\f3166                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n   By any analysis, a five-year period of confinement of an\nalien who has not been charged with any crime, and who has\nwon relief at every administrative level, is unreasonable under\nthe standards set forth by the Supreme Court. Nor are we per-\nsuaded by the government’s argument that because the Attor-\nney General will someday review Nadarajah’s case, his\ndetention will at some point end, and so he is not being held\nindefinitely. No one can satisfactorily assure us as to when\nthat day will arrive. Meanwhile, petitioner remains in deten-\ntion.\n\n                              B\n\n   [9] Nadarajah has established that there is no significant\nlikelihood of his removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\nHe has been awarded asylum twice, as well as protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture once. In assessing now\nwhether it is reasonably foreseeable that he will be ordered\nremoved, it is useful to place his success before the agency in\na larger context. According to the Executive Office for Immi-\ngration Review, during Fiscal Year 2005, only 12% of aliens\nwho applied for relief from removal were awarded such relief\nby an immigration judge. Executive Office for Immigration\nReview, FY 2005 Statistical Year Book (2006), D2. Eighty-\nfour percent (84%) of the total immigration judge decisions\nwere to order removal of the alien from the United States. Id.\nOf asylum cases reviewed on the merits, the rate of denial was\n62%. Id. at K2. Immigration judges denied the relief of with-\nholding of removal in 87% of the cases heard on the merits.\nId. at K5. Relief under the Convention Against Torture is\nawarded even more rarely. During FY 2005, the grant rate by\nimmigration judges was approximately 2%. Id. at M1. The\nfact that Nadarajah has won relief denied 98% of applicants\nis a powerful indication of the improbability of his foresee-\nable removal, by any objective measure.\n\n  Further, although the ultimate decision on whether to grant\nasylum is committed to the Attorney General’s discretion,\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                   3167\nrelief under withholding of removal is mandatory if the peti-\ntioner establishes that his “life or freedom would be threat-\nened” in the country to which he would be removed on\naccount of one of the five protected grounds. 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A); Boer-Sedano v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 1082,\n1092 (9th Cir. 2005). Withholding of removal is also manda-\ntory if the applicant meets his burden of proof regarding the\nlikelihood of future torture on application for relief under the\nConvention Against Torture. 8 U.S.C.A. § 1231(b)(3); 8\nC.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18.\n\n   [10] Thus, at this juncture, the government is not entitled\nto remove Nadarajah to Sri Lanka, and no other country has\nbeen identified to which Nadarajah might be removed. There-\nfore, examining the circumstances objectively, one cannot say\nthat his removal is reasonably foreseeable. The government\nhas not rebutted this showing, although it has had every\nopportunity to do so.\n\n                               C\n\n   [11] Given the unreasonable length of Nadarajah’s deten-\ntion, the unforeseeability of his removal, and the failure of the\ngovernment to rebut his showing that there is no significant\nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the\ngovernment’s continued detention violates federal law, as\nconstrued by the Supreme Court. Therefore, he is entitled to\nthe issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Given this result, we\nneed not reach any of the constitutional arguments advanced\nby Nadarajah.\n\n                               V\n\n   Nadarajah also contends that ICE abused its discretion in\ndenying him parole. The statute governing parole, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(d)(5)(A), provides in pertinent part:\n\n    The Attorney General may . . . in his discretion\n    parole into the United States temporarily under such\n\f3168                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n    conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-\n    case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or signifi-\n    cant public benefit any alien applying for admission\n    to the United States, but such parole of such alien\n    shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien.\n\n   [12] The Attorney General has delegated this authority to\na number of officials, including ICE “directors of field opera-\ntions.” 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(a). While the discretion in making a\nparole decision is quite broad, it is not without limits. See\nClark v. Smith, 967 F.2d 1329, 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing\nMoret v. Karn, 746 F.2d 989 (3d Cir. 1984)) (“We have no\nbasis on this appeal to review the exercise of the discretion of\nthe Attorney General in denying parole [under 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(d)(5)(A)], although we observe that this discretion,\nwhile large, is not unlimited.”). Indeed, “immigration officials\nclearly have the authority to deny parole to unadmitted aliens\nif they can advance a facially legitimate and bona fide reason\nfor doing so.” Jean, 472 U.S. at 853 (quoting Jean II, 727\nF.2d 957, 977 (11th Cir. 1984)). If such a reason is advanced,\nthe denial of parole is essentially unreviewable. Noh v. INS,\n248 F.3d 938, 942 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n   Nadarajah was initially granted parole, conditioned on the\npayment of a bond. When he tendered the money for the\nbond, several years after the order granting parole, parole was\ndenied because the bond order was “stale.” After he was\nawarded relief by the IJ and BIA, he again requested parole.\nThese requests were denied because he “no longer m[et] the\ncriteria for a bond.”\n\n  [13] The agency abused its discretion in denying parole\nbecause the reasons it provided were not facially legitimate\nand bona fide. When the last request was made, the govern-\nment’s position had already been rejected by the IJ and the\nBIA. Further, Nadarajah had been granted parole previously.\nThe apparent conclusion in 2004 that Nadarajah’s continued\ndetention was in the public interest, or that his release poses\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                   3169\na risk to national security, is based on facially implausible\nevidence, and ignores Nadarajah’s evidence of the detention’s\ndeleterious effect on his health.\n\n   In the two cases in which we have upheld decisions by the\nAttorney General under the “facially legitimate and bona\nfide” standard, the factual basis for the reason offered by the\nAttorney General’s delegate was undisputed. In Noh, 248\nF.3d at 942, we upheld a visa revocation on the grounds, con-\nceded by the alien, “that the visa had been obtained illegally.”\nSimilarly, in Mason v. Brooks, 862 F.2d 190, 193-94 (9th Cir.\n1988), the alien sought parole in order to enter the United\nStates to apply for citizenship. The Attorney General’s dele-\ngate denied parole on the “facially legitimate and bona fide”\ngrounds that a prior and undisputed conviction rendered the\nalien excludable. Id. at 195.\n\n   [14] Here, the evidence regarding humanitarian release was\nundisputed. The government has already received a full hear-\ning on its contention that Nadarajah was a security risk, and\nits evidence has been rejected. Given these circumstances, we\nconclude that the agency abused its discretion in denying\nparole in 2004.\n\n                              VI\n\n  Also pending before the panel is Nadarajah’s renewed\nmotion for release pending appeal. We have authority to order\nsuch a release pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 23(b), which pro-\nvides:\n\n    (b) Detention or Release Pending Review of Deci-\n    sion Not to Release.\n\n    While a decision not to release a prisoner is under\n    review, the court or judge rendering the decision, or\n    the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a\n\f3170                     NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n     judge or justice of either court, may order that the\n     prisoner be:\n\n     (1) detained in the custody from which release is\n     sought;\n\n     (2)    detained in other appropriate custody;\n\n     (3) released on personal recognizance, with or\n     without surety.5\n\n   Our consideration of this request is governed by Maharaj\nv. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963 (9th Cir. 2002), in which we deter-\nmined that the proper standard for evaluating a similar motion\nwas “the traditional standard for interim injunctive relief,\n[according to which] the moving party ‘must show either (1)\na probability of success on the merits and the possibility of\nirreparable harm, or (2) that serious legal questions are raised\nand the balance of hardships tips sharply in the moving\nparty’s favor.’ ” 295 F.3d at 966. As we have explained,\n“these two alternatives represent extremes of a single contin-\nuum, rather than two separate tests.” Immigrant Assistance\nProject of Los Angeles County Fed’n of Labor v. INS, 306\n   5\n     Given the text of the rule, the government’s argument that “this Court\nshould not consider, let alone grant, extraordinary relief by motion where\nentitlement vel non to release is the very issue on appeal,” is baffling: such\na release is precisely what the rule contemplates.

Under this analysis, “the greater the rela-\ntive hardship to the moving party, the less probability of suc-\ncess must be shown.” Id. (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n\n   As indicated by the analysis of Nadarajah’s habeas corpus\nclaims, we conclude that he has shown a probability of suc-\ncess on the merits. The balance of hardships also favor releas-\ning Nadarajah. There is undisputed evidence in the record that\nhis health is deteriorating, a deterioration that is only exacer-\nbated by continuing detention. Therefore, we grant the motion\nfor release, subject to conditions to be set by ICE.\n\n                              VII\n\n   [15] In sum, we conclude that the general detention statutes\nrelied upon by the government do not authorize indefinite\ndetention. When examined under the analysis prescribed by\nthe Supreme Court, Nadarajah’s detention is unreasonable,\nunjustified, and in violation of federal law. ICE abused its dis-\ncretion in denying parole during the pendency of these pro-\nceedings. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the district\ncourt denying Nadarajah’s petition for a writ of habeas cor-\npus. We grant his motion for immediate release, subject to\nterms and conditions to be set by the appropriate delegate of\nthe Attorney General.\n\n  REVERSED.\n\f",

He fled to the United States where he was\ndetained upon arrival. He applied for asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Tor-\nture. Twice, the government’s arguments against the grant of\nimmigration relief have been rejected and Nadarajah has been\nawarded relief by an immigration judge. This decision was\naffirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Yet, the gov-\nernment continues to detain Nadarajah, who has now been\nimprisoned for almost five years despite having prevailed at\nevery administrative level of review and who has never been\n\f3148                  NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\ncharged with any crime. We order that a writ of habeas corpus\nissue, and that he be released on appropriate conditions during\nthe pendency of any further proceedings.\n\n                                   I\n\n   This is a case about one individual, but as with most immi-\ngration cases, it can only be understood in the larger context\nof country conflict. The backdrop of this case is the quarter\ncentury-old battle between the government of Sri Lanki and\na group known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\n(“LTTE”) that seeks the creation of an independent state in\nareas in Sri Lanka inhabited by ethnic Tamils. The Tamils are\nan ethnic group who live in southern India and on Sri Lanka,\nan island of 19 million people off the southern tip of India.\nTamils comprise about 18 percent of the island’s population,\nand most live in its northern and eastern areas. Their Hindu\nreligion and Tamil language set them apart from the three-\nquarters of Sri Lankans who are Sinhalese—members of a\nlargely Buddhist, Sinhala-speaking ethnic group.\n\n   The LTTE separatist group, also known as the Tamil\nTigers, have used conventional, guerrilla, and terror tactics in\nthe decades-old civil war with the Sri Lankan government that\nhas claimed more than 60,000 lives and displaced hundreds of\nthousands of Sri Lankans. Based on its conflict with the Sri\nLankan government, the United State Department of State has\nlisted the LTTE as a foreign terrorist organization. After the\nterrorist attacks against the United States on September 11,\n2001, the LTTE declared a cease-fire against the Sri Lankan\ngovernment. In 2002, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan govern-\nment signed a formal cease-fire accord. The cease-fire\nremains in effect; however, there have been outbreaks of spo-\nradic violence in the area.\n\n  Ahilan Nadarajah is a 25 year old native and citizen of Sri\nLanka.1 He is a member of the Tamil ethnic minority. Nadara-\n  1\n   Because the Immigration Judge and the BIA found Nadarajah credible,\nwe assume for purposes of this Opinion that the following facts are true\nbased on his testimony in the asylum hearings.\n\f                   NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                 3149\njah lived with his family in the Jaffna peninsula at the north\nof Sri Lanka. He finished his schooling at age 17, and was\nworking as a farmer on land that his family owned. In 1995,\nthe Sri Lankan army invaded and shelled the area, displacing\nhis family to the town of Vanni, some 60 kilometers from\nJaffna. While they were leaving Jaffna by bicycle, one of the\nshells hit and killed Nadarajah’s older brother. Eighteen\nmonths later, in April of 1997, his family returned to Jaffna,\nbut because their home was occupied by the Sri Lankan army,\nthey stayed with an aunt, two kilometers away.\n\n   Shortly thereafter, Nadarajah first had problems with the\nSri Lankan army. On May 22, 1997, around 4:30 a.m., six or\nseven soldiers came into the home, beat him, blindfolded him,\nand took him to their camp. Because he had been in Vanni,\nhis attackers accused him of membership in the LTTE, which\nhe denied. For four months, Nadarajah was kept in the army\ncamp, where he was regularly questioned and tortured. His\nquestioners asked him to admit LTTE membership; when he\nrefused, they tortured him, with methods that included beating\nhim, sometimes with boards and gun handles, hanging him\nupside down, pricking his toenails with needles and burning\nhim with cigarette butts. He still bears the scars from those\ntorture sessions. He was eventually released when his mother\nbribed an army commander.\n\n   On October 5, 2000, Nadarajah was again arrested in his\nhome, this time by agents of the opposition Elam People’s\nDemocratic Party (“EPDP”). When he denied their accusa-\ntions of LTTE membership, he was beaten and taken to an\nEPDP camp. Nadarajah testified that the EPDP camp was\nfunded by and connected to the Sri Lankan government. For\na month, he was beaten and locked inside “a dark, dirty\nroom,” and forced to do menial labor. After a month of his\nmother’s begging, he was permitted to leave the camp in\nNovember of 2000, but required to report every morning for\ntwo months.\n\f3150                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n   Nadarajah was again arrested, by the Sri Lankan army, on\nJuly 10, 2001. A group of 15 to 20 soldiers approached him\nand his brother while they were working in a garden and took\nthem into custody. Although his brother was soon released\nbecause of poor health, Nadarajah was detained for a month,\nduring which he was again tortured:\n\n    Q.   In what ways did they abuse you?\n\n    A. They hung me upside down and they beat me.\n    While hanging upside down they brought a bag of\n    gasoline, put my head inside that bag and tied me. *\n    * * About 30 to 40 seconds I fainted. When I opened\n    my eyes I was in my room. * * * They [also] tied my\n    toes together and one person will pull one side and\n    the others, the other person will pull it. And the other\n    person pulled my head. They would fill the plastic\n    bag with sand and they will beat me with that. * *\n    * [And t]hey burned me with cigarette butts.\n\n   Nadarajah was released when his mother again bribed an\nofficial. He was told it was the last time he would be released\nand he ought to leave the country. Accompanied and funded\nby an uncle, Nadarajah departed immediately for Colombo,\nwith plans to go to Canada.\n\n   In October of 2001, Nadarajah left Sri Lanka, having\nobtained a passport and exit documents through a smuggler.\nHe traveled through Thailand, South Africa, Brazil and then\nMexico before reaching the United States on October 27,\n2001. He was apprehended by U.S. immigration officials at\nthe border, and has been detained since.\n\n   On November 9, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\nService granted Nadarajah parole from custody, conditioned,\ninter alia, on payment of a $20,000 bond. Unable to pay the\nbond, Nadarajah remained in custody. Nadarajah requested\nthat the bond amount be decreased on at least three occasions,\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                 3151\nbut these requests were denied. On August 9, 2004, counsel\nfor Nadarajah attempted to present $20,000 to secure his\nparole under the 2001 terms. However, the United States\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)\nwas “unwilling to accept the bond, stating that the previous\norder granting Mr. Nadarajah parole was ‘stale’ and ICE\ncould not honor it.”\n\n   In November of 2001, removal proceedings began against\nNadarajah. He conceded removability and applied for asylum\nand other relief, claiming past persecution and fear of future\npersecution on account of his ethnicity and imputed political\nopinion. The government obtained two continuances; not until\nApril 21, 2003, was a hearing held at which Nadarajah testi-\nfied. The government opposed Nadarajah’s asylum applica-\ntion on the grounds that he was affiliated with the LTTE, an\nallegation supported by the affidavit of an ICE agent who had\nreceived information from a confidential informant.\n\n   Despite the government’s allegations and “some discrepan-\ncies” in Nadarajah’s testimony, the immigration judge (“IJ”)\nfound Nadarajah credible, noting that his testimony was con-\nsistent and supportive of his asylum claim. The IJ granted\nasylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n   On April 25, 2003, the government filed a motion to re-\nopen the removal proceedings to introduce additional evi-\ndence, namely, to present the testimony of a Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”) agent. The IJ denied the motion,\nand the government appealed to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (“BIA” or “Board”). The BIA granted the motion to\nreopen and remanded to the IJ. In its remand order, the BIA\ninstructed the IJ to hear evidence in the form of testimony by\nthe DHS witness, special agent Schultz, even though the IJ\nhad given the DHS two postponements in order to present its\nwitness without the witness appearing.\n\n  Proceedings were held on June 8 and August 18, 2004.\nAgent Schultz testified, as well as Nadarajah’s expert witness.\n\f3152                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\nSchultz testified that his knowledge of the matter came from\nresearch that “involved reviewing public information that was\navailable on the [LTTE] from State Department reports,\nAmnesty International reports[, speaking] to people in the\nCanadian government that were considered experts on the\nground, and [speaking to] an ass[e]t of the Royal Canadian\nMounted Police who is an expert regarding the group.” When\nasked about the reliability of his Canadian sources, Schultz\nreplied that he “had no reason to question their reliability. So\n[he] assumed that everything they told [him] was true.” His\nfaith in his sources was buttressed when he received “an\nanonymous letter that [he] believe[d] was postmarked in Cali-\nfornia[, and a] lot of the information in that anonymous letter\nwas the same as the information that [he] had received from\nthe Canadian officials.” According to the informant, the area\nof Jaffna where Nadarajah lived was LTTE controlled, and it\nwould have been impossible for him to exit the area without\nthe approval and assistance of the LTTE. Therefore, con-\ncluded Schultz, Nadarajah must have been at least affiliated\nwith the LTTE.\n\n  Schultz also investigated the 20 Tamils smuggled with\nNadarajah. Schultz read the statements of all of the aliens, and\nconcluded that, in all 21 cases, “almost the entire declaration\nwas rehearsed [and coached], because they were so similar”:\n\n    I read their declarations, and I read the I-213s, and\n    they were all very similar, which led me to believe\n    that they were coached. Also, considering the fact\n    that they’re from the same general part of the world,\n    they all entered within a few days of each other, all\n    in the same general area, and came up with the same\n    almost exact story as far as their background and\n    their routes of travel, it appeared to me that they had\n    been coached.\n\n  In addition, since the first hearing, the informant had told\nSchultz of a May 2003, telephone call that Nadarajah had\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                     3153\nmade, along with a female detainee and LTTE member named\nSatchithananthan held at the same facility, to order that some-\none in Canada be killed.\n\n  On cross-examination, when asked how Nadarajah and\nSatchithananthan could have made the call “together” at the\ngender-segregated detention facility, Schultz responded:\n\n    I could only say that’s what I wrote. I mean I, I don’t\n    know. And I didn’t say that I knew. I didn’t say it\n    was one telephone call. I said both of these individu-\n    als placed a telephone call to Toronto. * * * So it\n    could have been on different days, it could have been\n    at different times.\n\nSchultz had no answer as to why he had not attempted to\nmonitor the telephones at the facility, or even subpoena the\nphone records.\n\n   Nadarajah’s expert, Robert Oberst, is a professor of politi-\ncal science and specialist in South Asian politics at Nebraska\nWesleyan University. He has served as an advisor to the\nUnited States government in various capacities, has published\nat least 75 articles on Sri Lanka, as well as four books (includ-\ning the most widely used textbook on South Asia) and has\nspent a total of at least three to four years living in Sri Lanka,\nmost recently in 2003, when he spent nine months in the\ncountry. Oberst testified that, in his research, he is very skep-\ntical of informants’ claimed identities, and often disbelieves\nhis purported informants. In his opinion, it was unlikely that\nthe LTTE would smuggle individuals out of Colombo, an area\ncontrolled by the Sri Lankan army. Further, Oberst testified\nthat the area of Jaffna where Nadarajah lived was under Sri\nLankan army control, and there was a military base near his\naunt’s house. As a result, in Oberst’s opinion, it was highly\nunlikely that the LTTE would be in any way involved in\nsmuggling a Tamil person out of this area.\n\f3154                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n   After assessing the new evidence, the IJ concluded that\n“this Court finds nothing of significance which would seri-\nously alter the Court’s original finding.” The IJ therefore rein-\nstated his prior order granting Nadarajah asylum.\n\n  After the IJ’s second decision granting asylum, Nadarajah’s\ncounsel submitted letters dated September 3 and 8, 2004,\nagain requesting parole. These requests were denied by San\nDiego ICE Field Office Director Ronald Smith on September\n20, 2004, pursuant to an August 13, 2004, determination by\nICE that Nadarajah “no longer m[et] the criteria for a bond.”\n\n   After the IJ’s second opinion and after his request for\nparole was denied, Nadarajah filed his habeas petition with\nthe District Court for the Southern District of California.\nMore than one year after he filed the petition, it was denied\nby the district court. This timely appeal followed.\n\n   Subsequently, on January 5, 2006, the BIA affirmed the\nIJ’s second opinion granting Nadarajah relief. The BIA dis-\nmissed the appeal and ordered the record remanded to the IJ\n“for the purpose of allowing [DHS] the opportunity to com-\nplete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investi-\ngations or examinations, and further proceedings, if\nnecessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8\nC.F.R. § 1003.47(h).” (citing Background and Security Inves-\ntigations in Proceedings Before the Immigration Judges and\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals, 70 Fed. Reg. 4743, 4752-\n54 (Jan 31, 2005)). The next day, in an unusual move, the\nBIA Chairperson referred the case to the Attorney General for\nreview, “seek[ing] guidance from the Attorney General on\nwhether he wishes to exercise his discretion and de novo\nreview authority in this case of national interest where the\nBoard applied the standard of review required by 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.1(d)(3).” The BIA did not provide for Nadarajah’s\nrelease from detention, where he remains without any estab-\nlished timeline for a decision on when he may be released\nfrom detention.\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                  3155\n   This appeal is confined to the district court’s denial of the\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus and the agency’s denial\nof parole. We review the district court’s decision to grant or\ndeny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 2241 de novo. Singh v.

No. 82-\n414, 66 Stat. 163 (June 27, 1952), by eliminating federal\nhabeas corpus jurisdiction over final orders of removal in\nfavor of petitions for review that raise “constitutional claims\nor questions of law.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (as amended by\nREAL ID Act § 106(a)(2)). However, this provision only\napplies to federal habeas corpus jurisdiction over “final orders\nof removal.” Id. By its terms, the jurisdiction-stripping provi-\nsion does not apply to federal habeas corpus petitions that do\nnot involve final orders of removal. Here, as we have noted,\nthere is no final order of removal. To the contrary, Nadarajah\nhas prevailed at every administrative level. Therefore, in cases\nthat do not involve a final order of removal, federal habeas\ncorpus jurisdiction remains in the district court, and on appeal\nto this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\f3156                NADARAJAH v.

Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the Supreme Court addressed the legality of\ndetention of aliens who had been ordered removed under 8\nU.S.C. § 1231(a)(6).2 Reasoning that “[a] statute permitting\nindefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitu-\ntional problem,” and that Congress cannot authorize indefinite\ndetention in the absence of a clear statement, the Court con-\nstrued the statute to permit detention only while removal\nremained reasonably foreseeable. Id. at 690, 699. After a pre-\nsumptively reasonable six-month detention, “once the alien\nprovides good reason to believe that there is no significant\nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the\nGovernment must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut\nthat showing.” Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.\n\n  [3] Although Zadvydas dealt with the detention of aliens\n  2\n   8 U.S.C. §1231(a)(6) provides:\n      An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C.\n      § 1182, removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C), (a)(2), or\n      (a)(4) or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be\n      a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of\n      removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if\n      released, shall be subject to . . . terms of supervision.\n\f3158                NADARAJAH v.

Id. At 377, 378.\n\n   The Clark Court did not decide that the indefinite detention\nof inadmissible aliens presented the same constitutional prob-\nlems in the same degree as the detention of admissible aliens.\n543 U.S. at 380. To the contrary, the Court relied on the stat-\nute’s applicability to admitted aliens and the necessity of con-\nsistent interpretation:\n\n    The Government . . . argues that the statutory pur-\n    pose and the constitutional concerns that influenced\n    our statutory construction in Zadvydas are not pres-\n    ent for aliens . . . who have not been admitted to the\n    United States. Be that as it may, it cannot justify giv-\n    ing the same detention provision a different meaning\n    when such aliens are involved. It is not at all unusual\n    to give a statute’s ambiguous language a limiting\n    construction called for by one of the statute’s appli-\n    cations, even though other of the statute’s applica-\n    tions, standing alone, would not support the same\n    limitation. * * * [W]hen deciding which of two plau-\n    sible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must\n    consider the natural consequences of its choice. If\n    one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional\n    problems, the other should prevail—whether or not\n    those constitutional problems pertain to the particu-\n    lar litigant before the Court.\n\nId. at. 380-81.\n\f                        NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                         3159\n   The statutes cited by the government, 8 U.S.C.\n§§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) and (b)(2)(A), apply to any alien an\nimmigration officer determines to be inadmissible and to have\na credible fear of persecution, and, in the case of\n§ 1225(b)(2)(A), any alien the immigration officer determines\nnot to be “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.”3\nTherefore, although the Zadvydas Court referred to terrorism\nas the kind of issue that might permit extended detention, see\n533 U.S. at 691 (internal quotation marks omitted) (“The pro-\nvision authorizing detention does not apply narrowly to a\nsmall segment of particularly dangerous individuals, say sus-\npected terrorists, but broadly to aliens ordered removed.”); id.\nat 696 (“Neither do we consider terrorism or other special cir-\ncumstances where special arguments might be made for forms\nof preventive detention and for heightened deference to the\njudgments of the political branches with respects to matters of\nnational security.”), because these statutes are not limited to\nsuch applications, they cannot be read to authorize the indefi-\nnite detention of supposed terrorists but only the brief deten-\ntion of all others. This interpretation would abrogate the\nholding and reasoning in Clark by treating some detentions\nauthorized by the same statute differently, depending on the\nidentity and status of the detainee.\n\n   In addition, the Supreme Court has held that the existence\nof statutes authorizing the detention of suspected terrorists\nspecifically precludes the use of general detention statutes to\nauthorize the unlimited detention of terrorists. “The Court’s\ninterpretation of § 1231(a)(6) did not affect the detention of\nalien terrorists for the simple reason that sustained detention\nof alien terrorists is a ‘special arrangement’ authorized by a\n  3\n    Some admissible aliens are likely detained pursuant to these provi-\nsions, particularly given § 1225(b)(2)(A)’s requirement that the admissi-\nbility be “clear[ ] and beyond [ ] doubt” according to the immigration\nofficer. This fact only brings the cases even closer to the Clark situation:\nif admitted aliens can only be detained for a reasonable period, and admis-\nsible aliens may be detained pursuant to this statutory provision, then the\nstatute can only authorize a limited detention. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 380.\n\f3160                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\ndifferent statutory provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1537(b)(2)(C).”\nClark, 543 U.S. at 379 n.4.\n\n   [4] In short, applying the Supreme Court’s statutory analy-\nsis to the instant case, we conclude that the general immigra-\ntion detention statutes do not authorize the Attorney General\nto incarcerate detainees for an indefinite period. Rather, con-\nsistent with the Supreme Court’s approach in Zadvydas, we\nconclude that the statutes at issue permit detention only while\nremoval remains reasonably foreseeable. Further, consistent\nwith Zadvydas, we conclude that after a presumptively rea-\nsonable six-month detention, “once the alien provides good\nreason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of\nremoval in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government\nmust respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.”\nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.\n\n                               B\n\n   [5] Our conclusion that the general detention statutes can-\nnot be read as authorizing indefinite detention is bolstered by\nconsidering the immigration statutes as a whole. In fact, Con-\ngress has enacted provisions that allow the Attorney General\nto detain certain aliens for lengthy periods, but certain defined\ncategories of aliens, and only with procedural safeguards.\n\n   Specifically, the Patriot Act allows detention of suspected\nterrorists or other threats to national security, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1226a and 8 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1537. However, in order to\neffect such lengthy detentions, the Attorney General is\nrequired to certify that the statutory criteria has been met, and\nthe Attorney General must review the certifications every six\nmonths. Section 1226a contains the Patriot Act’s authoriza-\ntion of detention of suspected terrorists, providing that “the\nAttorney General shall take into custody any alien who is cer-\ntified” by the Attorney General where it is known or there are\nreasonable grounds to believe:\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                     3161\n    •   the alien comes to the United States to engage in\n        espionage or sabotage, § 1182(a)(3)(A)(i)(I);\n        § 1227(a)(4)(A)(i);\n\n    •   the alien comes to the United States to violate\n        U.S. law relating to the export of goods, technol-\n        ogy or sensitive information, § 1182(a)(3)(A)\n        (i)(II); § 1227(a)(4)(A)(i);\n\n    •   the alien comes to the United States to engage in\n        any activity with the purpose of opposing or\n        overthrowing the U.S. government, § 1182(a)(3)\n        (A)(iii); § 1227(a)(4)(A)(iii);\n\n    •   the alien has engaged in, is likely to engage\n        in, or to incite terrorist activity, or is or was a\n        member of a foreign terrorist organization.\n        § 1182(a)(3)(B); § 1127(a)(4)(B); § 1226a(a)(1);\n        § 1226a(a)(3).\n\n   The Attorney General may delegate the power to certify\nonly to the Deputy Attorney General, who may not in turn\ndelegate it. 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(4). An alien detained under\nthis section “whose removal is unlikely in the reasonably\nforeseeable future, may be detained for additional periods of\nup to six months only if the release of the alien will threaten\nthe national security of the United States or the safety of the\ncommunity or any person.” 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(6). The\nAttorney General is required to review certifications under\nthis section at six month intervals. 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(7).\n\n   Sections 1531-1537, enacted in 1996, establish the Alien\nTerrorist Removal Court and the procedures that it must fol-\nlow. Upon receipt of “classified information that an alien is\nan alien terrorist,” the Attorney General can file an applica-\ntion with the removal court and take the alien into custody. 8\nU.S.C. §§ 1533(a)(1), 1536(a)(1)(A). That application must\ncontain the Attorney General’s certification that the applica-\n\f3162                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\ntion satisfies the requirements of 8 U.S.C. § 1533, which\ninclude:\n\n    a statement of the facts and circumstances relied on\n    by the Department of Justice to establish probable\n    cause that (i) the alien is a terrorist; (ii) the alien is\n    physically present in the United States; and (iii) with\n    respect to such alien, [standard removal proceedings]\n    would pose a risk to the national security of the\n    United States.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1533(a)(1)(D).\n\n   [6] By their own terms, both statutory provisions for the\ndetention of suspected terrorists require that the Attorney\nGeneral “certify” the case before such detention begins. 8\nU.S.C. § 1226a; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1537. Nadarajah’s case has\nnot been so certified. In addition, the other procedural protec-\ntions of these statutes, including biannual reviews of certifica-\ntion, have not been conducted. 8 U.S.C. § 1226a(a)(7).\nIndeed, the government does not claim that the detention pro-\nvisions for terrorists under the Patriot Act justify Nadarajah’s\ndetention. However, the existence of these provisions is\nimportant in the statutory construction of the general deten-\ntion statutes upon which the government relies. The govern-\nment’s argument ignores a basic principle of statutory\nconstruction, namely that the specific prevails over the gen-\neral. Bonneville Power Admin. v. FERC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791853\"><a href=\"/opinion/791853/bonneville-power-administration-city-of-tacoma-port-of-seattle-coral/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 916\n(9th Cir. 2005) (citing Santiago Salgado v.

Given that Congress has placed\nspecific limits on the Attorney General’s authority to detain\nsuspected terrorists, those statutory provisions must govern\nsuch detentions, instead of the general detention provisions\nthat apply to all aliens coming into the United States.\n\n   Further, the structure of the immigration statutes, with spe-\ncific attention given to potential detentions of over six months\nin carefully defined categories, indicates that the period of\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                   3163\ndetention allowed under the general detention statutes must be\nconstrued as being brief and reasonable, as the Supreme Court\nhas determined in construing similar provisions.\n\n                               C\n\n   In sum, the government does not possess the authority\nunder the general detention statutes to hold Nadarajah, or any\nother alien who is similarly situated, indefinitely. Rather, con-\nsistent with the construction given by the Supreme Court to\nsimilar statutes, the detention must be for a reasonable period,\nand only if there is a “significant likelihood of removal in the\nreasonably foreseeable future. After a presumptively reason-\nable six-month detention, once the alien provides good reason\nto believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in\nthe reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must\nrespond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.” Zad-\nvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.\n\n                               IV\n\n   Applying the law to the facts of this case, we conclude that\na writ of habeas corpus must issue and Nadarajah must be\nreleased from custody. The length of the detention in this case\nhas been unreasonable. Nadarajah has established that there is\nno significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foresee-\nable future. The government has failed to respond with evi-\ndence sufficient to rebut that showing.\n\n                               A\n\n  [7] The nearly five-year detention in this case far exceeds\nboth any period of confinement found reasonable by the\nCourt, and the six-month period of presumptive reasonable-\nness.\n\n  Zadvydas and Clark used the six-month period as the\ntouchstone of reasonableness. In addition to its analysis in\n\f3164                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\nZadvydas and Clark, the Supreme Court has given further\nguidance as to what it considers to be a “reasonable” length\nof detention for aliens in Demore v. Kim, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127916\"><a href=\"/opinion/127916/demore-v-kim/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2003). In Demore, the Supreme Court held that the govern-\nment could detain aliens who had been convicted of a crime\nfor “the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.”\nId. at 513. In Demore, the Court discussed the data concern-\ning detention length, noting that “[t]he Executive Office for\nImmigration Review has calculated that, in 85% of the cases\nin which aliens are detained pursuant to § 1226(c), removal\nproceedings are completed in an average time of 47 days, and\na median of 30 days.” 538 U.S. at 529. The Court noted that\n“[i]n the remaining 15% of cases, in which the alien appeals\nthe decision of the Immigration Judge to the Board of Immi-\ngration Appeals, appeal takes an average of four months, with\na median time that is slightly shorter.” Id. The Court noted\nthat Kim, the respondent, had been detained for over six\nmonths, which was “somewhat longer than the average.” Id.\nat 530-31. However, the Court viewed that “temporary” con-\nfinement as permissible.\n\n   Demore was decided in the context of an alien convicted of\na crime who was detained pending a determination of remov-\nability. Here, the IJ first determined that Nadarajah is entitled\nto relief in the forms of asylum and withholding of removal\nunder the Convention Against Torture, and on remand deter-\nmined again that Nadarajah is entitled to relief from removal\nin the form of asylum, which was affirmed by the BIA. Thus,\nNadarajah’s detention is more akin to the situation in Zadvy-\ndas, which was “indefinite” and “potentially permanent.” 533\nU.S. at 690-91. Nonetheless, Demore endorses the general\nproposition of “brief” detentions, with a specific holding of a\nsix-month period as presumptively reasonable.\n\n  [8] A detention of nearly five years—ten times the amount\nof time the Supreme Court has considered acceptable absent\na special showing—is plainly unreasonable under any mea-\nsure.\n\f                        NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                         3165\n   The government argues, both in its briefing and at oral\nargument, that Demore stands for an entirely different propo-\nsition: an indefinite period of detention. It reasons that:\n\n      [b]y referring to average and median, the Court did\n      not, as Nadarajah tries to infer, restrict either its\n      holding or its reasoning to those cases where deten-\n      tion falls within the average or median length of\n      time. Of necessity, by referring to average and\n      median detention times, the Court implicitly\n      acknowledged that there would be shorter than aver-\n      age and longer than average detentions, and its\n      approval of the average and median necessarily cov-\n      ers the short and long detentions that go into the\n      mathematical equation to determine average and\n      median.\n\n   In other words, the government is contending that by refer-\nencing EOIR’s detention statistics, which described the aver-\nage and median lengths of detention, the Court was adopting\na rule that a detention of any length was entirely permissible\nbecause—of mathematical necessity—lengthy detentions\nwould have to go into the calculation of the average and\nmedian times. This is a patently absurd reading of Demore. In\nDemore, the Court grounded its holding by referencing a\n“brief period,” id. at 513, 523, of “temporary confinement.”\nId. at 531. There is no indication anywhere in Demore that the\nCourt would countenance an indefinite detention.4\n  4\n    The references to the brevity and limited nature of the confinement are\nfound throughout Demore. See id. at 513 (“Congress . . . may require that\n[criminal aliens] be detained for the brief period necessary for their\nremoval proceedings.”); id. at 523 (“[R]espondent argued that the Govern-\nment may not . . . detain him for the brief period necessary for his removal\nproceedings.”); id. at 526 (noting the “Court’s longstanding view that the\nGovernment may . . . detain deportable aliens during the limited period\nnecessary for their removal proceedings”); id. at 529 n.12 (noting “[t]he\nvery limited time of the detention at stake”).\n\f3166                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n   By any analysis, a five-year period of confinement of an\nalien who has not been charged with any crime, and who has\nwon relief at every administrative level, is unreasonable under\nthe standards set forth by the Supreme Court. Nor are we per-\nsuaded by the government’s argument that because the Attor-\nney General will someday review Nadarajah’s case, his\ndetention will at some point end, and so he is not being held\nindefinitely. No one can satisfactorily assure us as to when\nthat day will arrive. Meanwhile, petitioner remains in deten-\ntion.\n\n                              B\n\n   [9] Nadarajah has established that there is no significant\nlikelihood of his removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\nHe has been awarded asylum twice, as well as protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture once. In assessing now\nwhether it is reasonably foreseeable that he will be ordered\nremoved, it is useful to place his success before the agency in\na larger context. According to the Executive Office for Immi-\ngration Review, during Fiscal Year 2005, only 12% of aliens\nwho applied for relief from removal were awarded such relief\nby an immigration judge. Executive Office for Immigration\nReview, FY 2005 Statistical Year Book (2006), D2. Eighty-\nfour percent (84%) of the total immigration judge decisions\nwere to order removal of the alien from the United States. Id.\nOf asylum cases reviewed on the merits, the rate of denial was\n62%. Id. at K2. Immigration judges denied the relief of with-\nholding of removal in 87% of the cases heard on the merits.\nId. at K5. Relief under the Convention Against Torture is\nawarded even more rarely. During FY 2005, the grant rate by\nimmigration judges was approximately 2%. Id. at M1. The\nfact that Nadarajah has won relief denied 98% of applicants\nis a powerful indication of the improbability of his foresee-\nable removal, by any objective measure.\n\n  Further, although the ultimate decision on whether to grant\nasylum is committed to the Attorney General’s discretion,\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                   3167\nrelief under withholding of removal is mandatory if the peti-\ntioner establishes that his “life or freedom would be threat-\nened” in the country to which he would be removed on\naccount of one of the five protected grounds. 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A); Boer-Sedano v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791448\"><a href=\"/opinion/791448/jose-patricio-boer-sedano-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1092 (9th Cir. 2005). Withholding of removal is also manda-\ntory if the applicant meets his burden of proof regarding the\nlikelihood of future torture on application for relief under the\nConvention Against Torture. 8 U.S.C.A. § 1231(b)(3); 8\nC.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18.\n\n   [10] Thus, at this juncture, the government is not entitled\nto remove Nadarajah to Sri Lanka, and no other country has\nbeen identified to which Nadarajah might be removed. There-\nfore, examining the circumstances objectively, one cannot say\nthat his removal is reasonably foreseeable. The government\nhas not rebutted this showing, although it has had every\nopportunity to do so.\n\n                               C\n\n   [11] Given the unreasonable length of Nadarajah’s deten-\ntion, the unforeseeability of his removal, and the failure of the\ngovernment to rebut his showing that there is no significant\nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the\ngovernment’s continued detention violates federal law, as\nconstrued by the Supreme Court. Therefore, he is entitled to\nthe issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Given this result, we\nneed not reach any of the constitutional arguments advanced\nby Nadarajah.\n\n                               V\n\n   Nadarajah also contends that ICE abused its discretion in\ndenying him parole. The statute governing parole, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(d)(5)(A), provides in pertinent part:\n\n    The Attorney General may . . . in his discretion\n    parole into the United States temporarily under such\n\f3168                NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n    conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-\n    case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or signifi-\n    cant public benefit any alien applying for admission\n    to the United States, but such parole of such alien\n    shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien.\n\n   [12] The Attorney General has delegated this authority to\na number of officials, including ICE “directors of field opera-\ntions.” 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(a). While the discretion in making a\nparole decision is quite broad, it is not without limits. See\nClark v.

Indeed, “immigration officials\nclearly have the authority to deny parole to unadmitted aliens\nif they can advance a facially legitimate and bona fide reason\nfor doing so.” Jean, 472 U.S. at 853 (quoting Jean II, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"431115\"><a href=\"/opinion/431115/marie-lucie-jean-lucien-louis-plaintiffs-appellees-cross-appellants/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977 (11th Cir. 1984)). If such a reason is advanced,\nthe denial of parole is essentially unreviewable. Noh v. INS,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773086\"><a href=\"/opinion/773086/se-jong-noh-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n   Nadarajah was initially granted parole, conditioned on the\npayment of a bond. When he tendered the money for the\nbond, several years after the order granting parole, parole was\ndenied because the bond order was “stale.” After he was\nawarded relief by the IJ and BIA, he again requested parole.\nThese requests were denied because he “no longer m[et] the\ncriteria for a bond.”\n\n  [13] The agency abused its discretion in denying parole\nbecause the reasons it provided were not facially legitimate\nand bona fide. When the last request was made, the govern-\nment’s position had already been rejected by the IJ and the\nBIA. Further, Nadarajah had been granted parole previously.\nThe apparent conclusion in 2004 that Nadarajah’s continued\ndetention was in the public interest, or that his release poses\n\f                    NADARAJAH v. GONZALES                   3169\na risk to national security, is based on facially implausible\nevidence, and ignores Nadarajah’s evidence of the detention’s\ndeleterious effect on his health.\n\n   In the two cases in which we have upheld decisions by the\nAttorney General under the “facially legitimate and bona\nfide” standard, the factual basis for the reason offered by the\nAttorney General’s delegate was undisputed. In Noh, 248\nF.3d at 942, we upheld a visa revocation on the grounds, con-\nceded by the alien, “that the visa had been obtained illegally.”\nSimilarly, in Mason v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514836\"><a href=\"/opinion/514836/gregory-paul-mason-v-ronald-a-brooks-edwin-meese/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193-94 (9th Cir.\n1988), the alien sought parole in order to enter the United\nStates to apply for citizenship. The Attorney General’s dele-\ngate denied parole on the “facially legitimate and bona fide”\ngrounds that a prior and undisputed conviction rendered the\nalien excludable. Id. at 195.\n\n   [14] Here, the evidence regarding humanitarian release was\nundisputed. The government has already received a full hear-\ning on its contention that Nadarajah was a security risk, and\nits evidence has been rejected. Given these circumstances, we\nconclude that the agency abused its discretion in denying\nparole in 2004.\n\n                              VI\n\n  Also pending before the panel is Nadarajah’s renewed\nmotion for release pending appeal. We have authority to order\nsuch a release pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 23(b), which pro-\nvides:\n\n    (b) Detention or Release Pending Review of Deci-\n    sion Not to Release.\n\n    While a decision not to release a prisoner is under\n    review, the court or judge rendering the decision, or\n    the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or a\n\f3170                     NADARAJAH v. GONZALES\n     judge or justice of either court, may order that the\n     prisoner be:\n\n     (1) detained in the custody from which release is\n     sought;\n\n     (2)    detained in other appropriate custody;\n\n     (3) released on personal recognizance, with or\n     without surety.5\n\n   Our consideration of this request is governed by Maharaj\nv. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778260\"><a href=\"/opinion/778260/ravin-maharaj-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2002), in which we deter-\nmined that the proper standard for evaluating a similar motion\nwas “the traditional standard for interim injunctive relief,\n[according to which] the moving party ‘must show either (1)\na probability of success on the merits and the possibility of\nirreparable harm, or (2) that serious legal questions are raised\nand the balance of hardships tips sharply in the moving\nparty’s favor.’ ” 295 F.3d at 966. As we have explained,\n“these two alternatives represent extremes of a single contin-\nuum, rather than two separate tests.” Immigrant Assistance\nProject of Los Angeles County Fed’n of Labor v. INS, 306\n   5\n     Given the text of the rule, the government’s argument that “this Court\nshould not consider, let alone grant, extraordinary relief by motion where\nentitlement vel non to release is the very issue on appeal,” is baffling: such\na release is precisely what the rule contemplates.

Under this analysis, “the greater the rela-\ntive hardship to the moving party, the less probability of suc-\ncess must be shown.” Id. (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n\n   As indicated by the analysis of Nadarajah’s habeas corpus\nclaims, we conclude that he has shown a probability of suc-\ncess on the merits. The balance of hardships also favor releas-\ning Nadarajah. There is undisputed evidence in the record that\nhis health is deteriorating, a deterioration that is only exacer-\nbated by continuing detention. Therefore, we grant the motion\nfor release, subject to conditions to be set by ICE.\n\n                              VII\n\n   [15] In sum, we conclude that the general detention statutes\nrelied upon by the government do not authorize indefinite\ndetention. When examined under the analysis prescribed by\nthe Supreme Court, Nadarajah’s detention is unreasonable,\nunjustified, and in violation of federal law. ICE abused its dis-\ncretion in denying parole during the pendency of these pro-\nceedings. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the district\ncourt denying Nadarajah’s petition for a writ of habeas cor-\npus. We grant his motion for immediate release, subject to\nterms and conditions to be set by the appropriate delegate of\nthe Attorney General.\n\n  REVERSED.\n\f</pre>",
