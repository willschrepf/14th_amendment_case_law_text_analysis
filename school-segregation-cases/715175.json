St. Helena Parish School Board, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 801), we reversed the District Court's decision approving the continued use of freedom-of-choice in Claiborne Parish and directed the District Court to require a racially unitary school system by the beginning of the 1969-1970 school year.  On August 1, 1969, the District Court approved a school board plan which assigned twenty percent of the Negro student body to the formerly all white schools.  No provision was made for desegregation of the all-Negro schools.  An appeal from the District Court's order was pending when the Supreme Court decided Alexander et al. v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19.  A motion for summary reversal was then filed by appellants.  Subsequently this Court, sitting en banc, decided Singleton et al. v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1969, 419 F.2d 1211, in which we held that pupil desegregation should be postponed until September, 1970, but that full faculty desegregation should be accomplished by February 1, 1970.  On December 9, 1969, the District Court's order in this and three consolidated cases was reversed and Singleton relief was ordered.  Johnson et al. v. Jackson Parish School Board et al., 5 Cir. 1969, 420 F.2d 692.  On January 14, 1970, the Supreme Court reversed Singleton insofar as it deferred student desegregation beyond February 1, 1970, Carter et al. v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477.  Accordingly, this Court granted similar relief in this case on January 26, 1970.  Johnson et al. v.

No white students were assigned to the all-Negro schools but the few white students who desired to take certain vocational courses were transported to the Negro schools for such courses and then transported back to the white schools.
