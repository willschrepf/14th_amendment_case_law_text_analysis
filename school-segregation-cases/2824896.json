Joseph Curran, Jr., Attorney\nGeneral of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, for Appellees.\n\n\n                              OPINION\n\nWILKINS, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Dwayne E. Wessel brought this action pursuant to Part A of Title\nII of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, see 42\nU.S.C.A. §§ 12131-12134 (West 1995).1 The district court dismissed\nthe action, concluding that Wessel’s claim was barred by the State’s\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. We affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   In March 1999, Wessel was committed to the custody of the Mary-\nland Division of Corrections. Under Maryland law, all inmates are\nawarded a certain number of good conduct credits at the outset of\ntheir sentences; inmates can earn additional credits by participating in\ninstitutional work or education programs, or by participating in spe-\ncial projects. Completing a \"boot camp\" program is one way to earn\nspecial project credits.\n\n  Upon his incarceration, Wessel was assigned to a boot camp pro-\ngram, but he was deemed medically unqualified for the program and\nwas transferred to another correctional facility shortly thereafter. He\nwas then offered employment as a yard worker but was disqualified\nwhen he told prison officials that his feet hurt and that he could not\ndo the work. Subsequently, Wessel was placed on non-work status\nand transferred to the Jessup Pre-Release Unit (Jessup).\n  1\n   Wessel named Parris N. Glendening, Governor of the State of Mary-\nland, and numerous other state officials as defendants. We refer to these\nindividuals collectively as \"the State.\"\n\f4                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING\n   Wessel filed this action pro se while incarcerated at Jessup, claim-\ning that the State violated his rights under the ADA by failing to pro-\nvide him, as a disabled inmate, with opportunities to earn diminution\ncredits on an equal basis with non-disabled inmates.2 See 42 U.S.C.A.\n§ 12132 (providing that \"no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in\nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a\npublic entity\"). The district court dismissed the action upon the\nState’s motion, holding that Congress, in enacting Title II of the\nADA, did not validly abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity from suits for damages.3\n\n   Wessel appealed pro se, and we appointed counsel and calendared\nthe case for oral argument. The United States intervened pursuant to\n28 U.S.C.A. § 2403(a) (West 1994) and filed a brief and presented\nargument in support of the validity of abrogation.\n\n                                    II.\n\n   The Eleventh Amendment prohibits the extension of \"[t]he Judicial\npower of the United States\" to \"any suit in law or equity, commenced\nor prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another\nState, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" U.S. Const.\namend. XI. Although the text of the Eleventh Amendment does not\naddress suits for damages against an unconsenting state by its own\ncitizens, it is well settled that \"an unconsenting State is immune from\n\n    2\n     Wessel also maintained that the State’s conduct violated his rights\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We\naffirm the dismissal of this claim without further discussion.\n   3\n     Although the State did not raise this as a basis for dismissal, in this\nappeal it supports the holding of the district court. There is no dispute\nthat the Eleventh Amendment issue is properly before us. See Ford\nMotor Co. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 467 (1945) (\"The Elev-\nenth Amendment declares a policy and sets forth an explicit limitation\non federal judicial power of such compelling force that this Court will\nconsider the issue . . . even though urged for the first time in this\nCourt.\").\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                           5\nsuits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citi-\nzens of another State.\" Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974).4\n\n   Congress may abrogate immunity under certain circumstances. See\nSeminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55 (1996). Determin-\ning whether Congress has done so requires a court to consider two\nquestions: first, \"whether Congress has ‘unequivocally expresse[d] its\nintent to abrogate the immunity’; and second, whether Congress has\nacted ‘pursuant to a valid exercise of power.’\" Id. (alteration in origi-\nnal) (citation omitted) (quoting Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68\n(1985)). Whether Congress has abrogated the states’ sovereign immu-\nnity is a legal question, and as such is subject to de novo review, see\nUnited States v. Martin, 215 F.3d 470, 472 (4th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                   A.\n\n   Before conducting the abrogation analysis, we first address the\nscope of our analysis. The Government, relying on our decision in\nBrown v. North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles, 166 F.3d 698\n(4th Cir. 1999), asserts that our consideration of the abrogation ques-\ntion should be limited to the particular context of this litigation, i.e.,\nthe application of Title II to state prisons. We conclude that the rule\nannounced in Brown, which requires a court to consider the narrowest\nform of the constitutional question presented, does not apply here in\nthe manner suggested by the Government.5\n\n   In Brown, a class of disabled individuals challenged a fee charged\nby North Carolina for the issuance of handicapped parking placards,\nmaintaining that the fee violated a regulation promulgated pursuant to\nTitle II. This court concluded that when \"determining whether Elev-\nenth Amendment immunity is abrogated in a case involving a regula-\ntion,\" a court should \"examine the legality [only] of the specific\n  4\n    The protection of the Eleventh Amendment does not extend to suits\nseeking injunctive relief from state officials pursuant to Ex Parte Young,\n209 U.S. 123 (1908). See Edelman, 415 U.S. at 664. Because Wessel is\nno longer in state custody, no injunctive relief is available to him.\n  5\n    We do apply the rule in Brown to the extent of limiting our abrogation\nanalysis to Part A of Title II, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12131-12134.\n\f6                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nstatute and regulation whose asserted violation by state government\ngave rise to the claim for relief in federal court.\" Id. at 705.\n\n   The State urges us to hold that Brown was effectively overruled by\nBoard of Trustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), which held that\nCongress did not validly abrogate sovereign immunity when it\nenacted Title I of the ADA. We conclude, however, that the rule in\nBrown, which was adopted in the context of litigation challenging a\nparticular regulation, does not apply here, where the claim arises\ndirectly under Title II. The mere fact that this litigation concerns Title\nII itself, and not a regulation, is alone adequate to establish the inap-\nplicability of Brown. As discussed above, in Brown we admonished\nthat abrogation review should focus on the narrowest provision on\nwhich liability may be based. Here, that provision is Title II. What the\nGovernment proposes is not limiting our abrogation analysis to a par-\nticular provision, but rather to a particular defendant. This is not an\napplication of Brown; it is an extension of it. Moreover, such an\nextension is contraindicated by the language of Brown. The regulation\nchallenged there prohibited all public entities from levying surcharges\nto cover the cost of compliance with the ADA, and we conducted the\nabrogation analysis in precisely those terms, rather than limiting our\ninquiry to surcharges imposed by state motor vehicle departments.\nSee Brown, 166 F.3d at 707 (noting lack of congressional record\nregarding unconstitutional state surcharges for handicapped pro-\ngrams).\n\n   We further conclude that it would be improper to extend Brown as\nthe Government would have us do. Title II prohibits discrimination\nby any \"public entity.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 12132. The term \"public entity\"\nis defined to include states. See id. § 12131(1)(A). Significantly,\nnowhere does Title II specifically name prisons or any other arm of\nthe state. Thus, absent judicial redrafting of the statute, there is no\nnarrower constitutional question to address. Cf. United States v.\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985) (\"Statutes should be construed to\navoid constitutional questions, but this interpretive canon is not a\nlicense for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legisla-\nture.\").\n\n                                   B.\n\n   Having concluded that we must conduct the abrogation analysis as\nto the whole of Part A of Title II, we now turn to consideration of that\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                          7\nissue. The question of whether Congress adequately expressed its\nintent to abrogate is answered by the text of the statute. The ADA\nexplicitly provides that \"[a] State shall not be immune under the elev-\nenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an\naction in Federal or State court . . . for a violation of\" the ADA. 42\nU.S.C.A. § 12202 (West 1995). This provision unequivocally\nexpresses Congress’ intent to abrogate. See Brown, 166 F.3d at 705.\n\n                                   C.\n\n   We next must decide whether Congress properly exercised its\npower to abrogate. This inquiry is begun by ascertaining the basis for\nCongress’ abrogation. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59. In the\nADA, Congress asserted its intent \"to invoke the sweep of congressio-\nnal authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amend-\nment . . . , in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced\nday-to-day by people with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(b)(4)\n(West 1995).6 Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment vests Congress\nwith the authority to abrogate immunity. See Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427\nU.S. 445, 456 (1976) (\"[T]he Eleventh Amendment, and the principle\nof state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the\nenforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" (cita-\ntion omitted)).\n\n   Section 5 grants Congress the \"power to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation, the provisions of\" the Fourteenth Amendment, including\nthe following portion of § 1:\n\n      No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge\n      the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;\n      nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or\n      property, without due process of law; nor deny to any per-\n      son within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n  6\n   Congress also relied on its authority \"to regulate commerce.\" Id.\nHowever, the Interstate Commerce Clause does not provide Congress the\npower to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Seminole Tribe,\n517 U.S. at 59-66.\n\f8                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, §§ 1, 5. In exercising its enforcement\npower, \"Congress is not limited to mere legislative repetition of [the\nSupreme] Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at\n365. Rather, \"§ 5 is a positive grant of legislative power to Congress.\"\nCity of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 517 (1997) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see id. at 536 (\"It is for Congress in the first instance\nto ‘determin[e] whether and what legislation is needed to secure the\nguarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,’ and its conclusions are\nentitled to much deference.\" (alteration in original) (quoting Katzen-\nbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 651 (1966))). Therefore, \"[l]egislation\nwhich deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the\nsweep of Congress’ enforcement power even if in the process it pro-\nhibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional.\" Id. at 518.\n\n   Congress’ § 5 power is not unlimited, however. See Kimel v. Fla.\nBd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 81 (2000). Section 5 gives Congress the\npower to enforce the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment, but\nit does not create in Congress the power to \"decree the substance of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States.\" Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383\nU.S. 301, 326 (1966) (describing Congress’ § 5 power as \"remedial\").\nWere it otherwise, Congress could not be said to be enforcing the pro-\nvisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S.\nat 519. The distinction between remedy and redefinition is not always\neasy to draw, and a congressional determination that legislation is\nneeded is entitled to deference. See id. at 519-20. Nevertheless, \"the\ndistinction exists and must be observed.\" Id. at 520.\n\n   The determination of whether Congress has exceeded its § 5\nauthority—i.e., whether it has crossed the line from remedying consti-\ntutional wrongs to defining constitutional rights—rests upon the so-\ncalled \"congruence and proportionality\" test. See id. (explaining that\nin § 5 legislation, \"[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end\"). Application of this test proceeds in three steps.\nSee generally Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365-74 (applying congruence and\nproportionality test to Title I of the ADA). First, we must \"identify\nwith some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.\" Id.\nat 365. Once we have done so, we then must consider \"whether Con-\ngress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional . . . discrimi-\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                           9\nnation by the States.\" Id. at 368. Third, if the congressional record\nestablishes such a pattern, we must determine whether the legislation\nis congruent and proportional to the identified wrong, i.e., whether it\nis \"responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\"\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532. Strict proportionality is not required.\n\"Rather, Congress’ power ‘to enforce’ the Amendment includes the\nauthority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed\nthereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct,\nincluding that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text.\"\nKimel, 528 U.S. at 81.\n\n                                    1.\n\n   We turn first to the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Dis-\nabled individuals are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to\nspecial protection under the Equal Protection Clause. See City of Cle-\nburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 442-47 (1985)\n(concluding that mentally disabled are not suspect or quasi-suspect\nclass); Brown, 166 F.3d at 706 (extending Cleburne to all disabled\nindividuals). Therefore, state action affecting the disabled is subject\nonly to rational basis review. Under this standard, state action distin-\nguishing between the disabled and non-disabled is constitutional so\nlong as \"there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treat-\nment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\" Heller v. Doe, 509\nU.S. 312, 320 (1993). As the Supreme Court explained in Garrett,\n\n     the result of Cleburne is that States are not required by the\n     Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations\n     for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such indi-\n     viduals are rational. . . . If special accommodations for the\n     disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive\n     law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 367-68. In the context of Title II, therefore, the\nconstitutional right may be identified as follows: disabled people have\na constitutional right not to be subject to arbitrary or irrational exclu-\nsion from the services, programs, or benefits provided by the state.\n\n                                    2.\n\n  Having defined the scope of the constitutional right at stake, we\nnext must determine whether Congress legislated in light of a history\n\f10                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nor pattern of unconstitutional discrimination. We emphasize that our\nfocus is limited to unconstitutional conduct by the states, not by local\ngovernments, since the latter do not benefit from the protections of\nthe Eleventh Amendment. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 368-69; see also\nKimel, 528 U.S. at 90-91 (noting that record of discrimination in pri-\nvate sector will not support abrogation). Further, it is not sufficient for\nCongress to identify a few isolated instances of unconstitutional con-\nduct. Congress must rather identify a pattern of unconstitutional dis-\ncrimination that is nationwide in its scope. See Kimel, 528 U.S. at 90;\nFla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. College Sav. Bank,\n527 U.S. 627, 640-41 (1999).\n\n   We note that the Supreme Court has provided very little explicit\nguidance regarding what materials are relevant in examining the\nrecord on which abrogation was based. Additionally, the decisions of\nthe Court are sometimes in tension with each other. Compare, e.g.,\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 370-71 (declining to consider \"unexamined,\nanecdotal accounts\" of discrimination presented in testimony to con-\ngressionally appointed task force), with City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n530-31 (examining testimony presented in congressional hearings). At\nthe very least, we can be certain that legislative findings enacted as\npart of the statutory scheme should be considered. See Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 371. We need not decide whether statements in the congres-\nsional record—including committee reports and transcripts of debate\non the floors of the House and Senate—also constitute the kind of\nfindings upon which Congress may base abrogation. Even if we\nassume such materials to be relevant, as we do for purposes of this\nopinion, the record on which Congress based its decision to abrogate\nwas nevertheless inadequate.\n\n   We begin our examination of the record before Congress with the\nfindings included in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(a) (West\n1995). Congress made lengthy findings of discrimination against dis-\nabled individuals, some of which specifically concerned the failure to\nprovide access to public services and programs. See id. § 12101(a)(3)\n(noting that \"discrimination against individuals with disabilities per-\nsists in such critical areas as . . . education, . . . voting, and access to\npublic services\"); id. § 12101(a)(5) (noting that disabled individuals\nsuffer \"the discriminatory effects of . . . relegation to lesser services,\nprograms, activities, [and] benefits\"). The mere existence of such\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                           11\nfindings is not sufficient to support abrogation, however. Cf. United\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 614 (2000) (\"[T]he existence of\ncongressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the consti-\ntutionality of Commerce Clause legislation.\"). Rather, because the\nexistence of congressional authority to act is ultimately a judicial\nquestion, see id., albeit one as to which we owe Congress appropriate\ndeference, we must determine whether Congress’ findings were ade-\nquate. Here, Congress’ general findings are unhelpful in two respects.\nFirst, the findings do not identify any particular acts of discrimination\nby states, much less a pattern of such discrimination. See Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 369 (observing that, while the record before Congress sup-\nported a finding of discrimination against the disabled, \"the great\nmajority of these incidents do not deal with the activities of States\").\nFurthermore, it is not at all clear that Congress’ use of the term \"dis-\ncrimination\" referred to the sort of arbitrary and irrational behavior\nthat violates the Constitution. See Thompson v. Colorado, 278 F.3d\n1020, 1033 (10th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1960 (2002). But\nsee Dare v. California, 191 F.3d 1167, 1174 (9th Cir. 1999) (conclud-\ning that § 12101(a) contains \"specific factual findings of arbitrary and\ninvidious discrimination against the disabled\" that constituted a suffi-\ncient basis for abrogation).\n\n   Neither can we find an adequate record to support abrogation in the\nofficial congressional reports concerning the ADA. The reports do\ncontain several examples of unfavorable treatment of disabled people\nby public entities. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 29,\nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 311 (quoting testimony of dis-\nabled woman who was denied access to public school at age five\nbecause the principal deemed her a \"fire hazard\" (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); id. at 40, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 322 (quoting testi-\nmony regarding failure of village to make town hall accessible to the\ndisabled). Even assuming that these anecdotal reports clearly demon-\nstrate unconstitutional discrimination, the discrimination did not occur\nat the hands of the state.\n\n   The Government argues that, despite the paucity of the official\nrecord, Congress was nevertheless aware of many examples of uncon-\nstitutional discrimination by the states. In fact, a large portion of the\nGovernment’s brief is devoted to detailing some of these examples,\nextracted from hearings regarding the drafting and enactment of the\n\f12                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nADA. Through these examples, the Government presents its best case\nfor abrogation, but it falls short, as the following discussion of the\nGovernment’s examples illustrates.\n\n    The first group of examples offered by the Government concerns\naccess by disabled people to courtrooms, polling places, and public\nmeetings. It is not clear from the Government’s brief how many, if\nany, of these instances involved state discrimination.7 Even assuming\nthat all of the denials of access are attributable to the state, however,\nit is not clear that a constitutional violation occurred in any of the\ncited occurrences. For example, many of the complaints by disabled\nvoters concerned their inability to obtain access to polling places,\nwith the result that they were required to vote by absentee ballot. But,\nit is not necessarily irrational for a state to require disabled voters to\nsubmit absentee ballots rather than going to the expense of retrofitting\nor relocating an established polling place. See Hooks v. Clark County\nSch. Dist., 228 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting legitimate\nstate interest in conservation of scarce funds), cert. denied, 532 U.S.\n971 (2001). The same is true with respect to access to courthouses\nand public meetings. It may be hardhearted and hardheaded, see Gar-\nrett, 531 U.S. at 367-68, for the state to refuse to provide special\naccess for the disabled to courtrooms and public meetings. Such a\nfailure is not necessarily unconstitutional, however. For example, in\nmany cases the cost of renovating older buildings will provide a ratio-\nnal basis for failing to create access.\n\n   The Government also cites several examples of discrimination in\npublic education, such as inaccurate assignments of students with\nphysical disabilities to classes for the mentally disabled. But, as the\nGovernment acknowledges, the vast majority of public primary and\nsecondary education systems are not arms of the state entitled to the\nprotection of the Eleventh Amendment. The Government also details\nincidents of discrimination by state universities; while many of these\nexamples demonstrate bad conduct, such conduct is not necessarily\nunconstitutional. See id. at 370 (explaining that \"adverse, disparate\n  7\n   At least some of the cited occurrences clearly do not involve discrimi-\nnation by the state, such as one case involving a city manager and\nanother involving access to a city hall.\n\f                          WESSEL v. GLENDENING                            13\ntreatment often does not amount to a constitutional violation where\nrational-basis scrutiny applies\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   The Government also identified acts of discrimination by law\nenforcement officials. Without exception, all of the examples pro-\nvided by the Government involved local law enforcement officers, not\nstate officials. Additionally, the Government provides a laundry list\nof examples of failure to provide access to, or discrimination in, \"zon-\ning; the operation of zoos, public libraries, public swimming pools\nand park programs; and child custody proceedings.\" Br. for the\nUnited States as Intervenor at 30-31 (footnotes omitted). Most of\nthese are areas of local, not state, concern; even assuming that some\nof the Government’s examples concerned state activities, none of the\ncited examples involves demonstrably unconstitutional conduct.8\n\n   We also find it helpful to examine the list of examples of discrimi-\nnation cited by the dissent in Garrett, see Garrett, 531 U.S. at 391-\n424 (Appendix C to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting), although the\nmajority determined that these examples could not serve as a basis for\nabrogation with respect to Title I, see id. at 370-71.9 Of the more than\n550 examples cited, only a limited number—perhaps 52 at best—\ninvolve potential constitutional violations by an arm of the state with\nrespect to access to public services and programs. Of these 52, 15\ninvolve failures to enforce or comply with laws regarding handi-\ncapped parking spaces or access to buildings; it is unlikely that such\nconduct is unconstitutional. See Thompson, 278 F.3d at 1034\n(\"Apathetic attitudes and refusals to make accommodations do not\n  8\n     The Government also relies on laws passed by states at the height of\nthe eugenics movement in the early 1900s, mandating segregation and,\nin some cases, involuntary sterilization of certain groups of disabled peo-\nple. As the Court noted in Garrett, however, \"there is no indication that\nany State had persisted in requiring such harsh measures as of 1990 when\nthe ADA was adopted.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 369 n.6.\n   9\n     The dissent asserts that \"the Garrett Court specifically found that\" the\nexamples in Appendix C \"supported abrogation in Titles II and III of the\nADA.\" Post, at 19. To the contrary, the Supreme Court simply noted that\nthe vast majority of the claimed acts of discrimination listed in Appen-\ndix C were irrelevant to the only question before the Court, namely, the\nvalidity of abrogation under Title I of the ADA.\n\f14                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nusually violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). Several other examples\nconcern the denial of licenses or admission to programs based upon\nthe application of facially neutral requirements. Again, such conduct\nis unlikely to be unconstitutional. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370; Reick-\nenbacker v. Foster, 274 F.3d 974, 982 (5th Cir. 2001). Furthermore,\nwe agree with the majority in Garrett that the examples in Appendix\nC are so lacking in detail as to make it impossible to determine\nwhether a constitutional violation actually occurred. See Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 371 n.7. In view of the fact that the population of America\nincluded \"some 43,000,000\" disabled people when the ADA was\nenacted, see 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(a)(1), the paucity of examples of\neven potentially unconstitutional conduct by the states is telling. See\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 370.\n\n   We therefore conclude that Congress did not have an adequate\nrecord of unconstitutional discrimination by states against the dis-\nabled to support abrogation.10\n  10\n     The Government argues that even if Congress failed to identify a suf-\nficient number of examples of state discrimination in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause, abrogation is nevertheless valid because § 5\nalso empowers Congress to enact legislation to enforce the guarantees of\nthe Due Process Clause, and \"Congress did not need to identify irratio-\nnal government action in order to identify and address unconstitutional\ngovernment action\" with respect to due process guarantees. Br. for the\nUnited States as Intervenor at 10. Our response to this assertion is two-\nfold. First, the record before Congress is apparently devoid of examples\nof state violations of the Due Process Clause—the Government cites, and\nour research has revealed, none. Second, although the substantive consti-\ntutional provisions applied to the states through the Due Process Clause\nmay mandate accommodation of the disabled, see, e.g., LaFaut v. Smith,\n834 F.2d 389, 392-94 (4th Cir. 1987) (holding that refusal to make minor\nmodifications to prison toilets to accommodate inmate’s disability consti-\ntuted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Eighth Amendment),\n\"the Due Process Clause does not contain the general mandate found in\nTitle II, which requires accommodations by public entities in all of\n[their] services, programs, or activities,\" Thompson, 278 F.3d at 1032\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But see Popovich v. Cuyahoga\nCounty Ct. of Common Pleas, 276 F.3d 808, 813-16 (6th Cir. 2002) (en\nbanc) (holding that Congress validly abrogated sovereign immunity as to\ncertain due process claims under Title II of the ADA), petition for cert.\nfiled, 70 U.S.L.W. 3656 (U.S. Apr. 10, 2002) (No. 01-1503).\n\f                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING                         15\n                                  3.\n\n   Even if Congress had had before it an adequate record of unconsti-\ntutional state conduct, § 5 legislation is valid only insofar as it\nimposes a prohibition that is congruent and proportional to the viola-\ntions that Congress sought to prevent or remedy. See City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 520. As we explained above, this requirement may be sat-\nisfied by legislation that reaches plainly constitutional conduct, pro-\nvided \"there is reason to believe that many of the laws affected by the\ncongressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being uncon-\nstitutional.\" Id. at 532.\n\n  In Garrett, the Supreme Court determined that Title I failed this\n\"congruence and proportionality\" test in part because the ADA\nimposes on states a higher duty of justification than does the Equal\nProtection Clause:\n\n    [W]hereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore con-\n    stitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial\n    resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing\n    facilities, the ADA requires employers to make existing\n    facilities used by employees readily accessible to . . . indi-\n    viduals with disabilities. The ADA does except employers\n    from the reasonable accommodation requirement where the\n    employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would\n    impose an undue hardship . . . . However, even with this\n    exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is con-\n    stitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of\n    alternative responses that would be reasonable but would\n    fall short of imposing an undue burden upon the employer.\n    The Act also makes it the employer’s duty to prove that it\n    would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the\n    Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reason-\n    able bases for the employer’s decision.\n\nId. at 372 (brackets, citation, & internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   This reasoning applies with equal force to Title II, which requires\nstates to make programs and services accessible to the disabled unless\nproviding such access would \"fundamentally alter the nature of the\n\f16                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nservice, program, or activity.\"11 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (2001). For\nexample, it may be entirely rational (and thus constitutional) for a\nstate to refuse to move a polling place to a location that is accessible\nto the disabled (among other things, the state may be legitimately con-\ncerned about confusing voters who are used to voting in a particular\nlocation). However, unless the state can prove that moving the polling\nplace would fundamentally alter the service of providing polling\nplaces, which is highly doubtful, the state would be required to locate\nor create accessible polling places for all citizens, irrespective of the\ninconvenience and expense. Title II thus requires far more than does\nthe Constitution. See, e.g., Thompson, 278 F.3d at 1031 (\"In contrast\nto the Equal Protection Clause prohibition on invidious discrimination\nagainst the disabled and irrational distinctions between the disabled\nand the nondisabled, Title II requires public entities to recognize the\nunique position of the disabled and to make favorable accommoda-\ntions on their behalf.\"); Reickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 983 (\"Title II\nindisputably embodies more than merely a prohibition on unconstitu-\ntional discrimination against the disabled.\"); cf. Brown, 166 F.3d at\n707 (concluding that regulation prohibiting surcharges sought \"to\nredefine the Equal Protection Clause\" by creating \"a positive entitle-\nment to a free handicapped parking space\").\n\n                                    D.\n\n   In sum, we conclude that Congress did not validly abrogate the\nsovereign immunity of the states when it enacted Part A of Title II of\nthe ADA. Although Congress properly and clearly expressed its intent\nto do so, it acted on the basis of an inadequate record and imposed\na remedy that is neither congruent nor proportional to the problem it\nidentified. In reaching this holding, we join the majority of our sister\n  11\n    The dissent asserts that because the requirements of Title II are satis-\nfied when a state makes its services, programs, and activities accessible,\nthe burden imposed by Title II on states is less than that imposed by Title\nI and, therefore, the reasoning of Garrett is not applicable. We disagree.\nThe mere fact that some accommodations may be accomplished at little\nor no cost to the state—for example, by relocating a class from the sec-\nond to the first floor of a building without an elevator—does not estab-\nlish that, as a whole, Title II requires little more of the states than does\nthe Constitution.\n\f                          WESSEL v. GLENDENING                           17\ncircuit courts. See Garcia v. SUNY Health Scis. Ctr., 280 F.3d 98, 112\n(2d Cir. 2001) (holding that Title II exceeds Congress’ authority\nunder § 5 to the extent that it authorizes suits against states when\nthere is no evidence of \"discriminatory animus or ill will due to dis-\nability\"); Popovich v. Cuyahoga County Ct. of Common Pleas, 276\nF.3d 808, 812-16 (6th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (holding abrogation\ninvalid as to equal protection, but not due process, claims), petition\nfor cert. filed, 70 U.S.L.W. 3656 (U.S. Apr. 10, 2002) (No. 01-1503);\nThompson, 278 F.3d at 1030-34 (holding abrogation invalid); Reick-\nenbacker, 274 F.3d at 981-83 (same); Walker v. Snyder, 213 F.3d\n344, 346-47 (7th Cir. 2000) (same); Alsbrook v. City of Maumelle,\n184 F.3d 999, 1005-10 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (same). Only one cir-\ncuit, in a case decided before Garrett, has squarely held to the con-\ntrary. See Dare, 191 F.3d at 1173-75.12\n\n                                    III.\n\n  For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the district court\ncorrectly dismissed Wessel’s claim under Part A of Title II of the\nADA. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                                                              AFFIRMED\n\nKING, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n  Because I believe that Congress successfully abrogated state sover-\n  12\n    The Government makes much of the fact that the Supreme Court\ndenied certiorari in Dare mere days after its decision in Garrett. How-\never, the Court denied certiorari in Walker on the same day.\n   In dictum in a pre-Garrett decision, the First Circuit stated that, when\nfaced with the question, it \"almost certainly\" would uphold the abroga-\ntion of immunity in Title II. Torres v. P.R. Tourism Co., 175 F.3d 1, 6\nn.7 (1st Cir. 1999). More recently, the First Circuit has held \"that Con-\ngress acted within its powers in subjecting the states to private suit under\nTitle II of the ADA, at least as that Title is applied to cases in which a\ncourt identifies a constitutional violation by the state.\" Kiman v. N.H.\nDep’t of Corr., ___ F.3d ___, 2002 WL 1880377, at *10 (1st Cir. Aug.\n20, 2002). The court declined to consider the validity of abrogation\nbeyond the particular application of the ADA at issue. See id. at *6-*8.\n\f18                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\neign immunity when it enacted Title II of the ADA, I must dissent.\nMy primary disagreement with my friends in the majority relates both\nto their refusal to give proper credit to specific record evidence of dis-\ncrimination by state entities in public programs, and to their denial to\nCongress of the deference due when our elected representatives make\ngeneral findings of fact in support of legislation. Furthermore, the\nmajority mistakenly asserts that, because Title II reaches certain con-\nstitutional conduct, the ADA’s abrogation of immunity must be\nunsuccessful. Though the majority gives lip service to the notion that\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that Congress tai-\nlor its legislative remedies with surgical precision, the effect of its\ndecision is to demand just that. I will elaborate briefly on each of\nthese points of disagreement.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   The Supreme Court held last year, in Board of Trustees of the Uni-\nversity of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), that Congress\nexceeded its enforcement authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment when it sought to abrogate state sovereign immunity in\nTitle I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117 (addressing discrimi-\nnation by employers affecting interstate commerce). In so holding, the\nGarrett Court observed that the legislative record of the ADA \"fails\nto show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state\ndiscrimination in employment against the disabled.\" 531 U.S. at 368\n(emphasis added). Of significance here, the Court’s Garrett decision\nexpressly reserved the question of whether Title II, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12131-12165 (addressing discrimination by public entities in the\noperation of public services), is appropriate legislation under § 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 360 n.1. The legislative record\nbefore us in support of Title II’s abrogation of state sovereign immu-\nnity is far stronger than that found wanting by the Garrett Court.\nGiven the strength of this record, a modicum of respect for the work-\nings of the legislative branch of government should prompt us to con-\nclude that Congress’s findings in support of Title II abrogation were\nsufficient.\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                           19\n                                    A.\n\n                                    1.\n\n   The Garrett Court found that Congress had failed to identify a suf-\nficient \"pattern\" of unconstitutional discrimination to support its § 5\nabrogation of state sovereign immunity in Title I of the ADA. See,\ne.g., Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370 (\"[E]ven if it were to be determined that\neach [record] incident upon fuller examination showed unconstitu-\ntional action on the part of the State, these incidents taken together\nfall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional dis-\ncrimination on which § 5 legislation must be based.\"). While the leg-\nislative record supporting Title I failed to establish a pattern of\nunconstitutional discrimination by the states, no such deficiency\nexists in the record supporting Title II.\n\n   The congressional record supporting abrogation under Title II of\nthe ADA contains abundant evidence of specific acts of unconstitu-\ntional state discrimination against the disabled in the operation of\npublic programs. As Justice Breyer observed in his Garrett dissent,\n\"[t]here are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state govern-\nments themselves in the legislative record [of the ADA].\" Garrett,\n531 U.S. at 379 (Breyer, J., dissenting). And according to the Garrett\nmajority itself, \"[t]he overwhelming majority of these accounts per-\ntain to alleged discrimination by the States in the provision of public\nservices and public accommodations, which areas are addressed in\nTitles II and III of the ADA.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370 n.7 (emphasis\nadded) (Rehnquist, C.J.). In other words, the Garrett Court specifi-\ncally found that the overwhelming majority of Congress’s specific\nevidence of discrimination failed to uphold the Title I abrogation sim-\nply because it supported abrogation in Titles II and III of the ADA\ninstead.1\n   1\n     The majority insists that \"the Supreme Court simply noted that the\nvast majority of the claimed acts of discrimination listed in Appendix C\nwere irrelevant to the only question before the Court, namely, the valid-\nity of abrogation under Title I of the ADA.\" Ante at 13 n.9. This is incor-\nrect. In light of the fact that the Chief Justice stated baldly that the\nevidence in Appendix C \"pertain[s] to alleged discrimination by the\nStates in the . . . areas . . . addressed in Titles II and III of the ADA,\"\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 370 n.7, the majority’s suggestion that the Court\nconfined its discussion to Title I is mistaken.\n\f20                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\n   The congressional record supporting abrogation under Title II is\nstronger still by virtue of the fact that Title II implicates constitutional\nrights that trigger heightened judicial scrutiny. While Title I dealt\nonly with employment discrimination, Title II addresses discrimina-\ntion implicating, inter alia, parental rights, voting rights, and the\nEighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.2\nWhereas a state is constitutionally entitled to engage in \"rational\"\nemployment discrimination on the basis of disability, a state’s\ninfringement of a disabled person’s parental, voting, or Eighth\nAmendment rights is subjected to more searching scrutiny.\n\n   Instances in which states denied to the disabled certain fundamen-\ntal rights are recounted throughout the legislative record underlying\nTitle II. Held to the appropriate, higher levels of scrutiny, such dis-\ncrimination is clearly unconstitutional. For instance, Congress heard\nthat a blind voter with cerebral palsy was arbitrarily refused the right\nto register to vote in state elections. Staff of the House Comm. on\nEduc. and Labor, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 Legis. Hist. of Pub. L. No.\n101-336: The Americans with Disabilities Act 1220, 100th Cong., 2d\nSess. (Comm.

Hist. 1324-25, are part\nof the official legislative history of the ADA, see id. at 1336, 1389.\n   4\n     The Supreme Court held in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307\n(1982), that there are constitutionally protected liberty interests under the\ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in reasonably safe con-\nditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints, and\nsuch minimally adequate training as reasonably might be required by\nthese interests.\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                          21\ntional state discrimination, the congressional record underlying Title\nII of the ADA provides more than adequate support for Congress’s\nabrogation of state sovereign immunity under § 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\n                                    2.\n\n   In addition to amassing specific evidence in support of the Title II\nabrogation, Congress made an express general finding that the states\nhad engaged in a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination in the\noperation of public services. In rejecting Congress’s Title I abroga-\ntion, the Garrett Court relied heavily on the fact that Congress’s\nrecord failed to conclude that state employment practices demon-\nstrated a pattern of discrimination against the disabled. Relying on\nSenate and House committee reports as indicative of Congress’s judg-\nment regarding general patterns of discrimination, Chief Justice\nRehnquist explained that \"had Congress truly understood [the evi-\ndence] as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the\nStates, one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Act’s\nlegislative findings. There is none.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370-72.\nStrikingly, there is such a finding with respect to the public services\ngoverned by Title II. The very Senate report relied upon by the Chief\nJustice concluded that \"[d]iscrimination still persists in such critical\nareas as employment in the private sector, public accommodations,\npublic services, transportation, and telecommunications.\" S. Rep. No.\n101-116, p. 6 (1989) (emphasis added); see Garrett, 531 U.S. at 371.\nAnd the House report on which Chief Justice Rehnquist relied\nreached the same conclusion: \"After extensive review and analysis\nover a number of Congressional sessions, . . . [we find that] there\nexists a compelling need to establish a clear and comprehensive Fed-\neral prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas\nof employment in the private sector, public accommodations, public\nservices, transportation, and telecommunications.\" H.R. Rep. No.\n101-485, pt. 2, p. 28 (1990) (emphasis added); see Garrett, 531 U.S.\nat 371.\n\n   Thus, while Congress made no mention at all of the public sector\nin its finding of persistent employment discrimination, it expressly\nconcluded that there existed a pattern of discrimination in public ser-\nvices for Congress to remedy through § 5 abrogation of state sover-\n\f22                      WESSEL v.

Given that the Garrett majority characterized\nCongress’s failure to make a general finding of public sector employ-\nment discrimination as \"strong evidence\" of \"that body’s judgment\nthat no pattern of unconstitutional state action had been documented,\"\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 371, we must take Congress’s finding of public\nservices discrimination as compelling evidence of its judgment that a\npattern of unconstitutional conduct was documented for Title II.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   Both Congress’s specific findings and its general conclusion of\nrampant discrimination in public services should satisfy this Court\nthat our elected representatives did indeed identify a pattern of uncon-\nstitutional state action that justified abrogation of state sovereign\nimmunity with respect to Title II of the ADA. Instead, the majority\ntransforms what is properly a factual question within Congress’s pur-\nview into a legal question for this Court’s determination. And beyond\nmerely trespassing on Congress’s proper fact-finding role, the major-\nity establishes and applies a standard of review that even a detailed\nlegislative record could not possibly satisfy. It is, in my view, inap-\npropriate for the unelected judiciary to so interfere with a coequal\nbranch of government.\n\n   The Supreme Court has recognized that \"Congress may paint with\na much broader brush than may this Court, which must confine itself\nto the judicial function of deciding individual cases and controversies\nupon individual records.\" Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 284\n(1970) (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is\nuniquely Congress’s role to draw general conclusions from anecdotal\nevidence gathered from a broad swath of the population, and its\ndesign — unlike that of the federal courts — suits it for this function.\nAccordingly, the federal courts are not then to \"sit as a superlegisla-\nture to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determi-\nnations.\" Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993) (quoting New\nOrleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam)); see also\nFCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)\n(emphasizing that it is not for the courts \"to judge the wisdom, fair-\nness, or logic of legislative choices\"). Congress’s judgment that a pat-\ntern of state discrimination persists, and that such discrimination\nrequires a federal remedy, is entitled to \"a great deal of deference,\n\f                         WESSEL v.

Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 331 n.12 (1985).\n\n   In the § 5 context, the Supreme Court has specifically admonished\nthat \"[i]t [i]s for Congress . . . to assess and weigh the various con-\nflicting considerations — the risk or pervasiveness of the discrimina-\ntion in governmental services, . . . the adequacy or availability of\nalternative remedies, and the nature and significance of the state inter-\nests that would be affected. . . . It is not for us to review the congres-\nsional resolution of these factors.\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S.\n641, 653 (1966); see also Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ.\nExpense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627, 639 (1999) (stat-\ning that \"Congress must have wide latitude\") (quoting City of Boerne\nv. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997)); City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 528,\n536 (reaffirming Morgan and adding that Congress’s \"conclusions are\nentitled to much deference\"). Rather, \"[i]t is enough that we be able\nto perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the con-\nflict as it did.\" Morgan, 384 U.S. at 653; see also City of Cleburne\nv. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 441 (1985) (\"[C]ourts have\nbeen very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with\nour respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legisla-\ntive choices [under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment].\").\n\n   Our deference to Congress’s assessment of the problems facing this\nnation is particularly appropriate when the problems are those of a\n\"large and diversified group,\" such as the disabled. See Cleburne, 473\nU.S. at 442. Addressing discrimination against the disabled, as Con-\ngress did in the ADA, \"is a difficult and often a technical matter, very\nmuch a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not\nby the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary.\" Id. at 442-43.\nThe drafting of the ADA is itself a case study in the sort of exhaus-\ntive, nationwide fact-finding for which Congress is uniquely suited.5\n  5\n    In its development of the ADA, Congress created a special task force,\nwhich conducted public hearings in every state. Those hearings were\nattended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had\nexperienced discrimination first hand. See Task Force on the Rights and\nEmpowerment of Americans with Disabilities, From ADA to Empower-\n\f24                      WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nIn view of the substantiality of the Title II record showing unconstitu-\ntional state discrimination, a modicum of respect for Congress should\ncompel the conclusion that Congress built a record adequate to sup-\nport abrogation of sovereign immunity in Title II of the ADA.\n\n                                   II.\n\n    The majority also maintains, in support of its conclusion that Con-\ngress did not validly abrogate immunity under Title II, that \"[e]ven if\nCongress had had before it an adequate record of unconstitutional\nstate conduct,\" the Title II abrogation would be improper because it\n\"impose[s] a remedy that is neither congruent nor proportional to the\nproblem [Congress] identified.\" Ante at 15, 16 (citing City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 520). The majority’s interpretation of congruence and\nproportionality in effect requires that Congress’s remedy be a perfect\nfit, prohibiting only such conduct as is itself unconstitutional. The\nSupreme Court, though, has repeatedly recognized that such precision\nin statutory tailoring is not required when Congress legislates under\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   Title II of the ADA mandates that a state make \"reasonable modifi-\ncations\" to its policies and practices to accommodate the disabled. 42\nU.S.C. § 12131(2). The majority contends that this requirement lacks\nthe congruence and proportionality required of legislation under § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante at 15-16. It takes as its example\nthe possibility that, under the ADA, a state might \"be required to\nlocate or create accessible polling places for all citizens, irrespective\nof inconvenience and expense.\" Ante at 16. While I would dispute the\n\nment 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report). The House of\nRepresentatives held eleven hearings, the Senate held three, and both\nhouses of Congress engaged in lengthy floor debates. See Timothy M.\nCook, The Americans with Disabilities Act: The Move to Integration, 64\nTemp. L. Rev. 393, 393-94 (1991) (summarizing the fact-finding process\nthat preceded passage of the ADA). Only upon conclusion of this thor-\nough process did Congress pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990, which the first President Bush then signed into law.\n\f                          WESSEL v. GLENDENING                            25\n                                                             6\nmajority’s characterization of what the ADA requires, the majority\nis nonetheless correct that certain discriminatory state action may be\nunreasonable under the ADA, and yet constitutional. That fact,\nthough, does not render Title II’s abrogation of sovereign immunity\nimproper.\n\n   As the majority concedes, the \"congruence and proportionality\"\nrequirement of § 5 may be satisfied by legislation that reaches plainly\nconstitutional conduct, provided that \"there is reason to believe that\nmany of the laws affected by the congressional enactment have a sig-\nnificant likelihood of being unconstitutional.\" City of Boerne, 521\nU.S. at 532. Ante at 15. The Supreme Court has held that\n\"[l]egislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can\nfall within the sweep of Congress’ [§ 5] enforcement power even if\nin the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional\n. . . .\" Florida Prepaid, 527 U.S. at 638 (1999) (quoting City of\n  6\n    By positing that the state’s obligation exists \"irrespective of inconve-\nnience and expense,\" the majority indulges an alarmist statutory interpre-\ntation, indicating that it overestimates the degree to which Title II’s\nrequirements reach beyond those imposed by the Constitution. Title II\ndoes not require that a state make accommodations irrespective of incon-\nvenience and expense. See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S.\n581, 603-04 (1999) (holding that a state may take into account cost and\navailable resources in determining whether and how to accommodate the\ndisabled under Title II). Furthermore, Title II’s requirement that public\nentities make \"reasonable modifications\" to accommodate the disabled,\n42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), obliges states only to make their programs acces-\nsible. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1) (stating that when existing facilities are\ninaccessible, a public entity \"is not required to make structural changes,\"\nso long as it makes its programs available to the disabled in some other\nmanner); see also Anderson v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 1 F. Supp. 2d\n456, 464 (\"The overall policy of [Title II of] the ADA is to require rela-\ntively few changes to existing buildings . . . .\" (citation omitted)). Thus,\nfar from requiring that the state \"locate or create accessible polling places\nfor all citizens, irrespective of inconvenience and expense,\" as the major-\nity fears, ante at 16, Title II apparently demands nothing more than pro-\nvision of an absentee ballot alternative. Cf. Dipietrae v. City of Phila.,\n666 A.2d 1132 (Pa. Commw.), aff’d, 673 A.2d 905 (Pa. 1995) (discuss-\ning absentee ballots as an ADA-satisfying option for disabled voters who\ncannot go to the polls).\n\f26                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 518) (emphasis added); cf. Morgan, 383 U.S. at\n324 (interpreting the similarly worded Enforcement Clause of the Fif-\nteenth Amendment to permit Congress to use \"any rational means to\neffectuate the constitutional prohibition\"). Under Supreme Court pre-\ncedent, § 5 legislation is appropriately \"congruent and proportional\"\nif it is \"responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behav-\nior.\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532.\n\n   Title II is both responsive to and designed to prevent a congressio-\nnally identified pattern of constitutional violations in the operation of\npublic programs. By requiring \"reasonable modifications\" in policies\nand practices, Title II charges the states with an affirmative duty to\naddress the sources of discrimination against the disabled in the oper-\nation of their public programs. Cf. Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S.\n430, 437-38 (1968) (stating that after unconstitutional segregation,\ngovernment is \"charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever\nsteps might be necessary\" to eliminate discrimination). Congress\ncould reasonably have concluded that a statutory regime that reaches\ncertain constitutional conduct is necessary both to root out unconstitu-\ntional conduct that would otherwise escape detection, and to deter\nfuture constitutional violations.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   While the Garrett Court indicated in dicta that the breadth of rights\nand remedies created under Title I \"would raise . . . concerns about\ncongruence and proportionality,\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 372, Title II\naverts such concerns by departing from Title I in two important\nrespects: first, Title II requires more limited accommodation of the\ndisabled; and second, it targets discrimination by public entities acting\nnot as employers, but rather as sovereigns. As explained below, due\nto these two distinctions, Title II interferes with \"rational\" (and there-\nfore constitutional) discrimination against the disabled to a lesser\ndegree than did Title I. Accordingly, the remedy that Title II provides\nis more closely tailored to its goal of eliminating unconstitutional dis-\ncrimination than was the remedy under Title I, and its § 5 abrogation\nis entirely proper. I address these distinctions in turn.\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                          27\n                                    1.\n\n   Whereas Title I expressly requires modification of existing, inac-\ncessible facilities to accommodate the disabled, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(b)(5)(A); Garrett, 521 U.S. at 372, Title II does not. Rather,\nTitle II requires only that public entities make their programs accessi-\nble. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. This requirement is satisfied if, for instance,\na state offers a program in an alternate setting to individuals who are\nunable to use an existing facility. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1); see\nAnderson v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 1 F. Supp. 2d 456, 464 (\"The\noverall policy of [Title II of] the ADA is to require relatively few\nchanges to existing buildings . . . .\" (citation omitted)). As a result,\nTitle II requires that the states make fewer affirmative accommoda-\ntions than did Title I; and the prophylactic scope of Title II imposes\na minimal burden because, as Congress found, the vast majority of the\nthose accommodations entail little or no cost.7 By demanding that the\nstates make fewer and less burdensome accommodations, Title II\ninterferes in constitutional state discrimination against the disabled to\na lesser degree than did Title I.8\n\n                                    2.\n\n   In finding that Congress did not validly abrogate sovereign immu-\nnity in Title I, the Garrett Court emphasized that Title I requires that\n  7\n     See S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 10-12, 89, 92 (1989);\nH.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 2, at 34 (1990).\n   8\n     The majority responds to this argument by stating that \"the mere fact\nthat some accommodations may be accomplished at little or no cost . . .\ndoes not establish that, as a whole, Title II requires little more of the\nstates than does the Constitution.\" Ante at 16 n.11. Clearly not. What it\ndoes establish, though, is that, by both imposing fewer costs and\ndemanding fewer accommodations, Title II raises fewer congruence and\nproportionality concerns than did Title I. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S.\nat 534 (congruence and proportionality concerns are most acute when\nstatutory compliance entails \"substantial costs\" that \"far exceed any pat-\ntern or practice of unconstitutional conduct\"); Garrett, 531 U.S. at 372\n(noting that congruence and proportionality is of particular concern\nunder Title I because \"the [Title I] accommodation duty far exceeds what\nis constitutionally required\").\n\f28                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nemployers make existing facilities accessible to the disabled, even\nthough \"it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for\na state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring\nemployees who are able to use existing facilities.\" Garrett, 531 U.S.\nat 372. The Supreme Court has held, though, that while a state has a\n\"significant\" interest in conserving resources and achieving its goals\nas effectively and efficiently as possible when it acts as an employer,\nthat same interest in efficiency is \"relatively subordinate\" when the\nstate acts in its sovereign capacity by, for instance, operating public\nprograms. See Board of County Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668,\n676 (1996). As a result, the scope of a state’s legitimate interest in\nmaximizing efficiency in the operation of its public programs is nar-\nrower than the scope of its legitimate interest in maximizing effi-\nciency as an employer. Since Title II — with remedial provisions no\nbroader than those of Title I — addresses discrimination by states in\ntheir operation of public programs, whereas Title I addressed discrim-\nination by states acting as employers, Title II necessarily intrudes less\non the states’ rational pursuit of legitimate interests. Hence, Title II\ninterferes in constitutional state discrimination against the disabled to\na lesser degree than did Title I.\n\n                                    C.\n\n   Even though Title II reaches certain constitutional conduct, it con-\nstitutes a rational effort to remedy and deter identified constitutional\nviolations, and it is an effort that is better tailored to address unconsti-\ntutional conduct than was Title I. Unless we intend to demand a per-\nfect statutory fit, rather than the \"congruence and proportionality\"\nrequired by the Supreme Court, Title II’s abrogation of state sover-\neign immunity remains well within Congress’s § 5 authority.\n\n                                    III.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, I see Title II’s abrogation of sovereign\nimmunity as passing constitutional muster. I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

Wessel brought this action pursuant to Part A of Title\nII of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, see 42\nU.S.C.A. §§ 12131-12134 (West 1995).1 The district court dismissed\nthe action, concluding that Wessel’s claim was barred by the State’s\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. We affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   In March 1999, Wessel was committed to the custody of the Mary-\nland Division of Corrections. Under Maryland law, all inmates are\nawarded a certain number of good conduct credits at the outset of\ntheir sentences; inmates can earn additional credits by participating in\ninstitutional work or education programs, or by participating in spe-\ncial projects. Completing a \"boot camp\" program is one way to earn\nspecial project credits.\n\n  Upon his incarceration, Wessel was assigned to a boot camp pro-\ngram, but he was deemed medically unqualified for the program and\nwas transferred to another correctional facility shortly thereafter. He\nwas then offered employment as a yard worker but was disqualified\nwhen he told prison officials that his feet hurt and that he could not\ndo the work. Subsequently, Wessel was placed on non-work status\nand transferred to the Jessup Pre-Release Unit (Jessup).\n  1\n   Wessel named Parris N. Glendening, Governor of the State of Mary-\nland, and numerous other state officials as defendants. We refer to these\nindividuals collectively as \"the State.\"\n\f4                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING\n   Wessel filed this action pro se while incarcerated at Jessup, claim-\ning that the State violated his rights under the ADA by failing to pro-\nvide him, as a disabled inmate, with opportunities to earn diminution\ncredits on an equal basis with non-disabled inmates.2 See 42 U.S.C.A.\n§ 12132 (providing that \"no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in\nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a\npublic entity\"). The district court dismissed the action upon the\nState’s motion, holding that Congress, in enacting Title II of the\nADA, did not validly abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity from suits for damages.3\n\n   Wessel appealed pro se, and we appointed counsel and calendared\nthe case for oral argument. The United States intervened pursuant to\n28 U.S.C.A. § 2403(a) (West 1994) and filed a brief and presented\nargument in support of the validity of abrogation.\n\n                                    II.\n\n   The Eleventh Amendment prohibits the extension of \"[t]he Judicial\npower of the United States\" to \"any suit in law or equity, commenced\nor prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another\nState, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" U.S. Const.\namend. XI. Although the text of the Eleventh Amendment does not\naddress suits for damages against an unconsenting state by its own\ncitizens, it is well settled that \"an unconsenting State is immune from\n\n    2\n     Wessel also maintained that the State’s conduct violated his rights\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We\naffirm the dismissal of this claim without further discussion.\n   3\n     Although the State did not raise this as a basis for dismissal, in this\nappeal it supports the holding of the district court. There is no dispute\nthat the Eleventh Amendment issue is properly before us. See Ford\nMotor Co. v.

Determin-\ning whether Congress has done so requires a court to consider two\nquestions: first, \"whether Congress has ‘unequivocally expresse[d] its\nintent to abrogate the immunity’; and second, whether Congress has\nacted ‘pursuant to a valid exercise of power.’\" Id.

Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), which held that\nCongress did not validly abrogate sovereign immunity when it\nenacted Title I of the ADA. We conclude, however, that the rule in\nBrown, which was adopted in the context of litigation challenging a\nparticular regulation, does not apply here, where the claim arises\ndirectly under Title II. The mere fact that this litigation concerns Title\nII itself, and not a regulation, is alone adequate to establish the inap-\nplicability of Brown. As discussed above, in Brown we admonished\nthat abrogation review should focus on the narrowest provision on\nwhich liability may be based. Here, that provision is Title II. What the\nGovernment proposes is not limiting our abrogation analysis to a par-\nticular provision, but rather to a particular defendant. This is not an\napplication of Brown; it is an extension of it. Moreover, such an\nextension is contraindicated by the language of Brown. The regulation\nchallenged there prohibited all public entities from levying surcharges\nto cover the cost of compliance with the ADA, and we conducted the\nabrogation analysis in precisely those terms, rather than limiting our\ninquiry to surcharges imposed by state motor vehicle departments.\nSee Brown, 166 F.3d at 707 (noting lack of congressional record\nregarding unconstitutional state surcharges for handicapped pro-\ngrams).\n\n   We further conclude that it would be improper to extend Brown as\nthe Government would have us do. Title II prohibits discrimination\nby any \"public entity.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 12132. The term \"public entity\"\nis defined to include states. See id. § 12131(1)(A). Significantly,\nnowhere does Title II specifically name prisons or any other arm of\nthe state. Thus, absent judicial redrafting of the statute, there is no\nnarrower constitutional question to address. Cf. United States v.\nAlbertini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111487\"><a href=\"/opinion/111487/united-states-v-albertini/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680 (1985) (\"Statutes should be construed to\navoid constitutional questions, but this interpretive canon is not a\nlicense for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legisla-\nture.\").\n\n                                   B.\n\n   Having concluded that we must conduct the abrogation analysis as\nto the whole of Part A of Title II, we now turn to consideration of that\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                          7\nissue. The question of whether Congress adequately expressed its\nintent to abrogate is answered by the text of the statute. The ADA\nexplicitly provides that \"[a] State shall not be immune under the elev-\nenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an\naction in Federal or State court . . . for a violation of\" the ADA. 42\nU.S.C.A. § 12202 (West 1995). This provision unequivocally\nexpresses Congress’ intent to abrogate. See Brown, 166 F.3d at 705.\n\n                                   C.\n\n   We next must decide whether Congress properly exercised its\npower to abrogate. This inquiry is begun by ascertaining the basis for\nCongress’ abrogation. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59. In the\nADA, Congress asserted its intent \"to invoke the sweep of congressio-\nnal authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amend-\nment . . . , in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced\nday-to-day by people with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(b)(4)\n(West 1995).6 Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment vests Congress\nwith the authority to abrogate immunity. See Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109520\"><a href=\"/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456 (1976) (\"[T]he Eleventh Amendment, and the principle\nof state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the\nenforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" (cita-\ntion omitted)).\n\n   Section 5 grants Congress the \"power to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation, the provisions of\" the Fourteenth Amendment, including\nthe following portion of § 1:\n\n      No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge\n      the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;\n      nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or\n      property, without due process of law; nor deny to any per-\n      son within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n  6\n   Congress also relied on its authority \"to regulate commerce.\" Id.\nHowever, the Interstate Commerce Clause does not provide Congress the\npower to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.

The distinction between remedy and redefinition is not always\neasy to draw, and a congressional determination that legislation is\nneeded is entitled to deference. See id. at 519-20. Nevertheless, \"the\ndistinction exists and must be observed.\" Id. at 520.\n\n   The determination of whether Congress has exceeded its § 5\nauthority—i.e., whether it has crossed the line from remedying consti-\ntutional wrongs to defining constitutional rights—rests upon the so-\ncalled \"congruence and proportionality\" test. See id. (explaining that\nin § 5 legislation, \"[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end\"). Application of this test proceeds in three steps.\nSee generally Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365-74 (applying congruence and\nproportionality test to Title I of the ADA). First, we must \"identify\nwith some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.\" Id.\nat 365.

GLENDENING                           9\nnation by the States.\" Id. at 368. Third, if the congressional record\nestablishes such a pattern, we must determine whether the legislation\nis congruent and proportional to the identified wrong, i.e., whether it\nis \"responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\"\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532. Strict proportionality is not required.\n\"Rather, Congress’ power ‘to enforce’ the Amendment includes the\nauthority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed\nthereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct,\nincluding that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text.\"\nKimel, 528 U.S. at 81.\n\n                                    1.\n\n   We turn first to the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Dis-\nabled individuals are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to\nspecial protection under the Equal Protection Clause. See City of Cle-\nburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442-47 (1985)\n(concluding that mentally disabled are not suspect or quasi-suspect\nclass); Brown, 166 F.3d at 706 (extending Cleburne to all disabled\nindividuals). Therefore, state action affecting the disabled is subject\nonly to rational basis review. Under this standard, state action distin-\nguishing between the disabled and non-disabled is constitutional so\nlong as \"there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treat-\nment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\" Heller v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (1993). As the Supreme Court explained in Garrett,\n\n     the result of Cleburne is that States are not required by the\n     Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations\n     for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such indi-\n     viduals are rational. . . . If special accommodations for the\n     disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive\n     law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 367-68. In the context of Title II, therefore, the\nconstitutional right may be identified as follows: disabled people have\na constitutional right not to be subject to arbitrary or irrational exclu-\nsion from the services, programs, or benefits provided by the state.\n\n                                    2.\n\n  Having defined the scope of the constitutional right at stake, we\nnext must determine whether Congress legislated in light of a history\n\f10                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nor pattern of unconstitutional discrimination. We emphasize that our\nfocus is limited to unconstitutional conduct by the states, not by local\ngovernments, since the latter do not benefit from the protections of\nthe Eleventh Amendment. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 368-69; see also\nKimel, 528 U.S. at 90-91 (noting that record of discrimination in pri-\nvate sector will not support abrogation). Further, it is not sufficient for\nCongress to identify a few isolated instances of unconstitutional con-\nduct. Congress must rather identify a pattern of unconstitutional dis-\ncrimination that is nationwide in its scope. See Kimel, 528 U.S. at 90;\nFla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. College Sav. Bank,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118316\"><a href=\"/opinion/118316/florida-prepaid-postsecondary-ed-expense-bd-v-college-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640-41 (1999).\n\n   We note that the Supreme Court has provided very little explicit\nguidance regarding what materials are relevant in examining the\nrecord on which abrogation was based. Additionally, the decisions of\nthe Court are sometimes in tension with each other. Compare, e.g.,\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 370-71 (declining to consider \"unexamined,\nanecdotal accounts\" of discrimination presented in testimony to con-\ngressionally appointed task force), with City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n530-31 (examining testimony presented in congressional hearings). At\nthe very least, we can be certain that legislative findings enacted as\npart of the statutory scheme should be considered. See Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 371. We need not decide whether statements in the congres-\nsional record—including committee reports and transcripts of debate\non the floors of the House and Senate—also constitute the kind of\nfindings upon which Congress may base abrogation. Even if we\nassume such materials to be relevant, as we do for purposes of this\nopinion, the record on which Congress based its decision to abrogate\nwas nevertheless inadequate.\n\n   We begin our examination of the record before Congress with the\nfindings included in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(a) (West\n1995). Congress made lengthy findings of discrimination against dis-\nabled individuals, some of which specifically concerned the failure to\nprovide access to public services and programs. See id. § 12101(a)(3)\n(noting that \"discrimination against individuals with disabilities per-\nsists in such critical areas as . . . education, . . . voting, and access to\npublic services\"); id. § 12101(a)(5) (noting that disabled individuals\nsuffer \"the discriminatory effects of . . . relegation to lesser services,\nprograms, activities, [and] benefits\"). The mere existence of such\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                           11\nfindings is not sufficient to support abrogation, however. Cf. United\nStates v. Morrison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 614 (2000) (\"[T]he existence of\ncongressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the consti-\ntutionality of Commerce Clause legislation.\"). Rather, because the\nexistence of congressional authority to act is ultimately a judicial\nquestion, see id., albeit one as to which we owe Congress appropriate\ndeference, we must determine whether Congress’ findings were ade-\nquate. Here, Congress’ general findings are unhelpful in two respects.\nFirst, the findings do not identify any particular acts of discrimination\nby states, much less a pattern of such discrimination. See Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 369 (observing that, while the record before Congress sup-\nported a finding of discrimination against the disabled, \"the great\nmajority of these incidents do not deal with the activities of States\").\nFurthermore, it is not at all clear that Congress’ use of the term \"dis-\ncrimination\" referred to the sort of arbitrary and irrational behavior\nthat violates the Constitution. See Thompson v. Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776379\"><a href=\"/opinion/776379/phoebe-thompson-dean-ecoff-and-marcia-e-wade-on-behalf-of-themselves/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033 (10th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766203\"><a href=\"/opinion/766203/william-robert-dare-gary-petillo-v-state-of-california-dept-of-motor/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174 (9th Cir. 1999) (conclud-\ning that § 12101(a) contains \"specific factual findings of arbitrary and\ninvidious discrimination against the disabled\" that constituted a suffi-\ncient basis for abrogation).\n\n   Neither can we find an adequate record to support abrogation in the\nofficial congressional reports concerning the ADA. The reports do\ncontain several examples of unfavorable treatment of disabled people\nby public entities. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 29,\nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 311 (quoting testimony of dis-\nabled woman who was denied access to public school at age five\nbecause the principal deemed her a \"fire hazard\" (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); id. at 40, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 322 (quoting testi-\nmony regarding failure of village to make town hall accessible to the\ndisabled). Even assuming that these anecdotal reports clearly demon-\nstrate unconstitutional discrimination, the discrimination did not occur\nat the hands of the state.\n\n   The Government argues that, despite the paucity of the official\nrecord, Congress was nevertheless aware of many examples of uncon-\nstitutional discrimination by the states. In fact, a large portion of the\nGovernment’s brief is devoted to detailing some of these examples,\nextracted from hearings regarding the drafting and enactment of the\n\f12                       WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nADA. Through these examples, the Government presents its best case\nfor abrogation, but it falls short, as the following discussion of the\nGovernment’s examples illustrates.\n\n    The first group of examples offered by the Government concerns\naccess by disabled people to courtrooms, polling places, and public\nmeetings. It is not clear from the Government’s brief how many, if\nany, of these instances involved state discrimination.7 Even assuming\nthat all of the denials of access are attributable to the state, however,\nit is not clear that a constitutional violation occurred in any of the\ncited occurrences. For example, many of the complaints by disabled\nvoters concerned their inability to obtain access to polling places,\nwith the result that they were required to vote by absentee ballot. But,\nit is not necessarily irrational for a state to require disabled voters to\nsubmit absentee ballots rather than going to the expense of retrofitting\nor relocating an established polling place. See Hooks v. Clark County\nSch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770685\"><a href=\"/opinion/770685/william-and-catherine-hooks-individually-and-as-parents-and-natural/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting legitimate\nstate interest in conservation of scarce funds), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">971</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). The same is true with respect to access to courthouses\nand public meetings. It may be hardhearted and hardheaded, see Gar-\nrett, 531 U.S. at 367-68, for the state to refuse to provide special\naccess for the disabled to courtrooms and public meetings. Such a\nfailure is not necessarily unconstitutional, however. For example, in\nmany cases the cost of renovating older buildings will provide a ratio-\nnal basis for failing to create access.\n\n   The Government also cites several examples of discrimination in\npublic education, such as inaccurate assignments of students with\nphysical disabilities to classes for the mentally disabled. But, as the\nGovernment acknowledges, the vast majority of public primary and\nsecondary education systems are not arms of the state entitled to the\nprotection of the Eleventh Amendment. The Government also details\nincidents of discrimination by state universities; while many of these\nexamples demonstrate bad conduct, such conduct is not necessarily\nunconstitutional. See id. at 370 (explaining that \"adverse, disparate\n  7\n   At least some of the cited occurrences clearly do not involve discrimi-\nnation by the state, such as one case involving a city manager and\nanother involving access to a city hall.\n\f                          WESSEL v. GLENDENING                            13\ntreatment often does not amount to a constitutional violation where\nrational-basis scrutiny applies\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   The Government also identified acts of discrimination by law\nenforcement officials. Without exception, all of the examples pro-\nvided by the Government involved local law enforcement officers, not\nstate officials. Additionally, the Government provides a laundry list\nof examples of failure to provide access to, or discrimination in, \"zon-\ning; the operation of zoos, public libraries, public swimming pools\nand park programs; and child custody proceedings.\" Br. for the\nUnited States as Intervenor at 30-31 (footnotes omitted). Most of\nthese are areas of local, not state, concern; even assuming that some\nof the Government’s examples concerned state activities, none of the\ncited examples involves demonstrably unconstitutional conduct.8\n\n   We also find it helpful to examine the list of examples of discrimi-\nnation cited by the dissent in Garrett, see Garrett, 531 U.S. at 391-\n424 (Appendix C to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting), although the\nmajority determined that these examples could not serve as a basis for\nabrogation with respect to Title I, see id. at 370-71.9 Of the more than\n550 examples cited, only a limited number—perhaps 52 at best—\ninvolve potential constitutional violations by an arm of the state with\nrespect to access to public services and programs. Of these 52, 15\ninvolve failures to enforce or comply with laws regarding handi-\ncapped parking spaces or access to buildings; it is unlikely that such\nconduct is unconstitutional. See Thompson, 278 F.3d at 1034\n(\"Apathetic attitudes and refusals to make accommodations do not\n  8\n     The Government also relies on laws passed by states at the height of\nthe eugenics movement in the early 1900s, mandating segregation and,\nin some cases, involuntary sterilization of certain groups of disabled peo-\nple. As the Court noted in Garrett, however, \"there is no indication that\nany State had persisted in requiring such harsh measures as of 1990 when\nthe ADA was adopted.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 369 n.6.\n   9\n     The dissent asserts that \"the Garrett Court specifically found that\" the\nexamples in Appendix C \"supported abrogation in Titles II and III of the\nADA.\" Post, at 19.

Again, such conduct\nis unlikely to be unconstitutional. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370; Reick-\nenbacker v.

Furthermore,\nwe agree with the majority in Garrett that the examples in Appendix\nC are so lacking in detail as to make it impossible to determine\nwhether a constitutional violation actually occurred. See Garrett, 531\nU.S. at 371 n.7. In view of the fact that the population of America\nincluded \"some 43,000,000\" disabled people when the ADA was\nenacted, see 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(a)(1), the paucity of examples of\neven potentially unconstitutional conduct by the states is telling. See\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 370.\n\n   We therefore conclude that Congress did not have an adequate\nrecord of unconstitutional discrimination by states against the dis-\nabled to support abrogation.10\n  10\n     The Government argues that even if Congress failed to identify a suf-\nficient number of examples of state discrimination in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause, abrogation is nevertheless valid because § 5\nalso empowers Congress to enact legislation to enforce the guarantees of\nthe Due Process Clause, and \"Congress did not need to identify irratio-\nnal government action in order to identify and address unconstitutional\ngovernment action\" with respect to due process guarantees. Br. for the\nUnited States as Intervenor at 10. Our response to this assertion is two-\nfold. First, the record before Congress is apparently devoid of examples\nof state violations of the Due Process Clause—the Government cites, and\nour research has revealed, none. Second, although the substantive consti-\ntutional provisions applied to the states through the Due Process Clause\nmay mandate accommodation of the disabled, see, e.g., LaFaut v.

See City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 520. As we explained above, this requirement may be sat-\nisfied by legislation that reaches plainly constitutional conduct, pro-\nvided \"there is reason to believe that many of the laws affected by the\ncongressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being uncon-\nstitutional.\" Id. at 532.\n\n  In Garrett, the Supreme Court determined that Title I failed this\n\"congruence and proportionality\" test in part because the ADA\nimposes on states a higher duty of justification than does the Equal\nProtection Clause:\n\n    [W]hereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore con-\n    stitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial\n    resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing\n    facilities, the ADA requires employers to make existing\n    facilities used by employees readily accessible to . . . indi-\n    viduals with disabilities. The ADA does except employers\n    from the reasonable accommodation requirement where the\n    employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would\n    impose an undue hardship . . . . However, even with this\n    exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is con-\n    stitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of\n    alternative responses that would be reasonable but would\n    fall short of imposing an undue burden upon the employer.\n    The Act also makes it the employer’s duty to prove that it\n    would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the\n    Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reason-\n    able bases for the employer’s decision.\n\nId. at 372 (brackets, citation, & internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   This reasoning applies with equal force to Title II, which requires\nstates to make programs and services accessible to the disabled unless\nproviding such access would \"fundamentally alter the nature of the\n\f16                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nservice, program, or activity.\"11 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (2001). For\nexample, it may be entirely rational (and thus constitutional) for a\nstate to refuse to move a polling place to a location that is accessible\nto the disabled (among other things, the state may be legitimately con-\ncerned about confusing voters who are used to voting in a particular\nlocation). However, unless the state can prove that moving the polling\nplace would fundamentally alter the service of providing polling\nplaces, which is highly doubtful, the state would be required to locate\nor create accessible polling places for all citizens, irrespective of the\ninconvenience and expense. Title II thus requires far more than does\nthe Constitution. See, e.g., Thompson, 278 F.3d at 1031 (\"In contrast\nto the Equal Protection Clause prohibition on invidious discrimination\nagainst the disabled and irrational distinctions between the disabled\nand the nondisabled, Title II requires public entities to recognize the\nunique position of the disabled and to make favorable accommoda-\ntions on their behalf.\"); Reickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 983 (\"Title II\nindisputably embodies more than merely a prohibition on unconstitu-\ntional discrimination against the disabled.\"); cf. Brown, 166 F.3d at\n707 (concluding that regulation prohibiting surcharges sought \"to\nredefine the Equal Protection Clause\" by creating \"a positive entitle-\nment to a free handicapped parking space\").\n\n                                    D.\n\n   In sum, we conclude that Congress did not validly abrogate the\nsovereign immunity of the states when it enacted Part A of Title II of\nthe ADA. Although Congress properly and clearly expressed its intent\nto do so, it acted on the basis of an inadequate record and imposed\na remedy that is neither congruent nor proportional to the problem it\nidentified. In reaching this holding, we join the majority of our sister\n  11\n    The dissent asserts that because the requirements of Title II are satis-\nfied when a state makes its services, programs, and activities accessible,\nthe burden imposed by Title II on states is less than that imposed by Title\nI and, therefore, the reasoning of Garrett is not applicable. We disagree.\nThe mere fact that some accommodations may be accomplished at little\nor no cost to the state—for example, by relocating a class from the sec-\nond to the first floor of a building without an elevator—does not estab-\nlish that, as a whole, Title II requires little more of the states than does\nthe Constitution.\n\f                          WESSEL v.

Furthermore, the\nmajority mistakenly asserts that, because Title II reaches certain con-\nstitutional conduct, the ADA’s abrogation of immunity must be\nunsuccessful. Though the majority gives lip service to the notion that\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that Congress tai-\nlor its legislative remedies with surgical precision, the effect of its\ndecision is to demand just that. I will elaborate briefly on each of\nthese points of disagreement.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   The Supreme Court held last year, in Board of Trustees of the Uni-\nversity of Alabama v.

In so holding, the\nGarrett Court observed that the legislative record of the ADA \"fails\nto show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state\ndiscrimination in employment against the disabled.\" 531 U.S. at 368\n(emphasis added). Of significance here, the Court’s Garrett decision\nexpressly reserved the question of whether Title II, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12131-12165 (addressing discrimination by public entities in the\noperation of public services), is appropriate legislation under § 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 360 n.1. The legislative record\nbefore us in support of Title II’s abrogation of state sovereign immu-\nnity is far stronger than that found wanting by the Garrett Court.\nGiven the strength of this record, a modicum of respect for the work-\nings of the legislative branch of government should prompt us to con-\nclude that Congress’s findings in support of Title II abrogation were\nsufficient.\n\f                         WESSEL v.

See,\ne.g., Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370 (\"[E]ven if it were to be determined that\neach [record] incident upon fuller examination showed unconstitu-\ntional action on the part of the State, these incidents taken together\nfall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional dis-\ncrimination on which § 5 legislation must be based.\"). While the leg-\nislative record supporting Title I failed to establish a pattern of\nunconstitutional discrimination by the states, no such deficiency\nexists in the record supporting Title II.\n\n   The congressional record supporting abrogation under Title II of\nthe ADA contains abundant evidence of specific acts of unconstitu-\ntional state discrimination against the disabled in the operation of\npublic programs. As Justice Breyer observed in his Garrett dissent,\n\"[t]here are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state govern-\nments themselves in the legislative record [of the ADA].\" Garrett,\n531 U.S. at 379 (Breyer, J., dissenting). And according to the Garrett\nmajority itself, \"[t]he overwhelming majority of these accounts per-\ntain to alleged discrimination by the States in the provision of public\nservices and public accommodations, which areas are addressed in\nTitles II and III of the ADA.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370 n.7 (emphasis\nadded) (Rehnquist, C.J.). In other words, the Garrett Court specifi-\ncally found that the overwhelming majority of Congress’s specific\nevidence of discrimination failed to uphold the Title I abrogation sim-\nply because it supported abrogation in Titles II and III of the ADA\ninstead.1\n   1\n     The majority insists that \"the Supreme Court simply noted that the\nvast majority of the claimed acts of discrimination listed in Appendix C\nwere irrelevant to the only question before the Court, namely, the valid-\nity of abrogation under Title I of the ADA.\" Ante at 13 n.9. This is incor-\nrect. In light of the fact that the Chief Justice stated baldly that the\nevidence in Appendix C \"pertain[s] to alleged discrimination by the\nStates in the . . . areas . . . addressed in Titles II and III of the ADA,\"\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 370 n.7, the majority’s suggestion that the Court\nconfined its discussion to Title I is mistaken.\n\f20                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\n   The congressional record supporting abrogation under Title II is\nstronger still by virtue of the fact that Title II implicates constitutional\nrights that trigger heightened judicial scrutiny. While Title I dealt\nonly with employment discrimination, Title II addresses discrimina-\ntion implicating, inter alia, parental rights, voting rights, and the\nEighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.2\nWhereas a state is constitutionally entitled to engage in \"rational\"\nemployment discrimination on the basis of disability, a state’s\ninfringement of a disabled person’s parental, voting, or Eighth\nAmendment rights is subjected to more searching scrutiny.\n\n   Instances in which states denied to the disabled certain fundamen-\ntal rights are recounted throughout the legislative record underlying\nTitle II. Held to the appropriate, higher levels of scrutiny, such dis-\ncrimination is clearly unconstitutional. For instance, Congress heard\nthat a blind voter with cerebral palsy was arbitrarily refused the right\nto register to vote in state elections.

In rejecting Congress’s Title I abroga-\ntion, the Garrett Court relied heavily on the fact that Congress’s\nrecord failed to conclude that state employment practices demon-\nstrated a pattern of discrimination against the disabled. Relying on\nSenate and House committee reports as indicative of Congress’s judg-\nment regarding general patterns of discrimination, Chief Justice\nRehnquist explained that \"had Congress truly understood [the evi-\ndence] as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the\nStates, one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Act’s\nlegislative findings. There is none.\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 370-72.\nStrikingly, there is such a finding with respect to the public services\ngoverned by Title II. The very Senate report relied upon by the Chief\nJustice concluded that \"[d]iscrimination still persists in such critical\nareas as employment in the private sector, public accommodations,\npublic services, transportation, and telecommunications.\" S. Rep. No.\n101-116, p. 6 (1989) (emphasis added); see Garrett, 531 U.S. at 371.\nAnd the House report on which Chief Justice Rehnquist relied\nreached the same conclusion: \"After extensive review and analysis\nover a number of Congressional sessions, . . . [we find that] there\nexists a compelling need to establish a clear and comprehensive Fed-\neral prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas\nof employment in the private sector, public accommodations, public\nservices, transportation, and telecommunications.\" H.R. Rep. No.\n101-485, pt. 2, p. 28 (1990) (emphasis added); see Garrett, 531 U.S.\nat 371.\n\n   Thus, while Congress made no mention at all of the public sector\nin its finding of persistent employment discrimination, it expressly\nconcluded that there existed a pattern of discrimination in public ser-\nvices for Congress to remedy through § 5 abrogation of state sover-\n\f22                      WESSEL v. GLENDENING\neign immunity. Given that the Garrett majority characterized\nCongress’s failure to make a general finding of public sector employ-\nment discrimination as \"strong evidence\" of \"that body’s judgment\nthat no pattern of unconstitutional state action had been documented,\"\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 371, we must take Congress’s finding of public\nservices discrimination as compelling evidence of its judgment that a\npattern of unconstitutional conduct was documented for Title II.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   Both Congress’s specific findings and its general conclusion of\nrampant discrimination in public services should satisfy this Court\nthat our elected representatives did indeed identify a pattern of uncon-\nstitutional state action that justified abrogation of state sovereign\nimmunity with respect to Title II of the ADA. Instead, the majority\ntransforms what is properly a factual question within Congress’s pur-\nview into a legal question for this Court’s determination. And beyond\nmerely trespassing on Congress’s proper fact-finding role, the major-\nity establishes and applies a standard of review that even a detailed\nlegislative record could not possibly satisfy. It is, in my view, inap-\npropriate for the unelected judiciary to so interfere with a coequal\nbranch of government.\n\n   The Supreme Court has recognized that \"Congress may paint with\na much broader brush than may this Court, which must confine itself\nto the judicial function of deciding individual cases and controversies\nupon individual records.\" Oregon v.

See Cleburne, 473\nU.S. at 442. Addressing discrimination against the disabled, as Con-\ngress did in the ADA, \"is a difficult and often a technical matter, very\nmuch a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not\nby the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary.\" Id. at 442-43.\nThe drafting of the ADA is itself a case study in the sort of exhaus-\ntive, nationwide fact-finding for which Congress is uniquely suited.5\n  5\n    In its development of the ADA, Congress created a special task force,\nwhich conducted public hearings in every state. Those hearings were\nattended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had\nexperienced discrimination first hand.

The majority’s interpretation of congruence and\nproportionality in effect requires that Congress’s remedy be a perfect\nfit, prohibiting only such conduct as is itself unconstitutional. The\nSupreme Court, though, has repeatedly recognized that such precision\nin statutory tailoring is not required when Congress legislates under\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   Title II of the ADA mandates that a state make \"reasonable modifi-\ncations\" to its policies and practices to accommodate the disabled. 42\nU.S.C. § 12131(2). The majority contends that this requirement lacks\nthe congruence and proportionality required of legislation under § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante at 15-16. It takes as its example\nthe possibility that, under the ADA, a state might \"be required to\nlocate or create accessible polling places for all citizens, irrespective\nof inconvenience and expense.\" Ante at 16. While I would dispute the\n\nment 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report). The House of\nRepresentatives held eleven hearings, the Senate held three, and both\nhouses of Congress engaged in lengthy floor debates. See Timothy M.\nCook, The Americans with Disabilities Act: The Move to Integration, 64\nTemp. L. Rev. 393, 393-94 (1991) (summarizing the fact-finding process\nthat preceded passage of the ADA). Only upon conclusion of this thor-\nough process did Congress pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990, which the first President Bush then signed into law.\n\f                          WESSEL v.

That fact,\nthough, does not render Title II’s abrogation of sovereign immunity\nimproper.\n\n   As the majority concedes, the \"congruence and proportionality\"\nrequirement of § 5 may be satisfied by legislation that reaches plainly\nconstitutional conduct, provided that \"there is reason to believe that\nmany of the laws affected by the congressional enactment have a sig-\nnificant likelihood of being unconstitutional.\" City of Boerne, 521\nU.S. at 532.

Title II\ndoes not require that a state make accommodations irrespective of incon-\nvenience and expense. See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel.

Furthermore, Title II’s requirement that public\nentities make \"reasonable modifications\" to accommodate the disabled,\n42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), obliges states only to make their programs acces-\nsible. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1) (stating that when existing facilities are\ninaccessible, a public entity \"is not required to make structural changes,\"\nso long as it makes its programs available to the disabled in some other\nmanner); see also Anderson v.

By requiring \"reasonable modifications\" in policies\nand practices, Title II charges the states with an affirmative duty to\naddress the sources of discrimination against the disabled in the oper-\nation of their public programs. Cf. Green v. County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437-38 (1968) (stating that after unconstitutional segregation,\ngovernment is \"charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever\nsteps might be necessary\" to eliminate discrimination). Congress\ncould reasonably have concluded that a statutory regime that reaches\ncertain constitutional conduct is necessary both to root out unconstitu-\ntional conduct that would otherwise escape detection, and to deter\nfuture constitutional violations.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   While the Garrett Court indicated in dicta that the breadth of rights\nand remedies created under Title I \"would raise . . . concerns about\ncongruence and proportionality,\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 372, Title II\naverts such concerns by departing from Title I in two important\nrespects: first, Title II requires more limited accommodation of the\ndisabled; and second, it targets discrimination by public entities acting\nnot as employers, but rather as sovereigns. As explained below, due\nto these two distinctions, Title II interferes with \"rational\" (and there-\nfore constitutional) discrimination against the disabled to a lesser\ndegree than did Title I. Accordingly, the remedy that Title II provides\nis more closely tailored to its goal of eliminating unconstitutional dis-\ncrimination than was the remedy under Title I, and its § 5 abrogation\nis entirely proper. I address these distinctions in turn.\n\f                         WESSEL v. GLENDENING                          27\n                                    1.\n\n   Whereas Title I expressly requires modification of existing, inac-\ncessible facilities to accommodate the disabled, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(b)(5)(A); Garrett, 521 U.S. at 372, Title II does not. Rather,\nTitle II requires only that public entities make their programs accessi-\nble. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. This requirement is satisfied if, for instance,\na state offers a program in an alternate setting to individuals who are\nunable to use an existing facility. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1); see\nAnderson v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569793\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569793/anderson-v-department-of-public-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As a result,\nTitle II requires that the states make fewer affirmative accommoda-\ntions than did Title I; and the prophylactic scope of Title II imposes\na minimal burden because, as Congress found, the vast majority of the\nthose accommodations entail little or no cost.7 By demanding that the\nstates make fewer and less burdensome accommodations, Title II\ninterferes in constitutional state discrimination against the disabled to\na lesser degree than did Title I.8\n\n                                    2.\n\n   In finding that Congress did not validly abrogate sovereign immu-\nnity in Title I, the Garrett Court emphasized that Title I requires that\n  7\n     See S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 10-12, 89, 92 (1989);\nH.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 2, at 34 (1990).\n   8\n     The majority responds to this argument by stating that \"the mere fact\nthat some accommodations may be accomplished at little or no cost . . .\ndoes not establish that, as a whole, Title II requires little more of the\nstates than does the Constitution.\" Ante at 16 n.11. Clearly not. What it\ndoes establish, though, is that, by both imposing fewer costs and\ndemanding fewer accommodations, Title II raises fewer congruence and\nproportionality concerns than did Title I. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S.\nat 534 (congruence and proportionality concerns are most acute when\nstatutory compliance entails \"substantial costs\" that \"far exceed any pat-\ntern or practice of unconstitutional conduct\"); Garrett, 531 U.S. at 372\n(noting that congruence and proportionality is of particular concern\nunder Title I because \"the [Title I] accommodation duty far exceeds what\nis constitutionally required\").\n\f28                        WESSEL v. GLENDENING\nemployers make existing facilities accessible to the disabled, even\nthough \"it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for\na state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring\nemployees who are able to use existing facilities.\" Garrett, 531 U.S.\nat 372. The Supreme Court has held, though, that while a state has a\n\"significant\" interest in conserving resources and achieving its goals\nas effectively and efficiently as possible when it acts as an employer,\nthat same interest in efficiency is \"relatively subordinate\" when the\nstate acts in its sovereign capacity by, for instance, operating public\nprograms. See Board of County Comm’rs v. Umbehr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118059\"><a href=\"/opinion/118059/board-of-commrs-wabaunsee-cty-v-umbehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n676 (1996). As a result, the scope of a state’s legitimate interest in\nmaximizing efficiency in the operation of its public programs is nar-\nrower than the scope of its legitimate interest in maximizing effi-\nciency as an employer. Since Title II — with remedial provisions no\nbroader than those of Title I — addresses discrimination by states in\ntheir operation of public programs, whereas Title I addressed discrim-\nination by states acting as employers, Title II necessarily intrudes less\non the states’ rational pursuit of legitimate interests. Hence, Title II\ninterferes in constitutional state discrimination against the disabled to\na lesser degree than did Title I.\n\n                                    C.\n\n   Even though Title II reaches certain constitutional conduct, it con-\nstitutes a rational effort to remedy and deter identified constitutional\nviolations, and it is an effort that is better tailored to address unconsti-\ntutional conduct than was Title I. Unless we intend to demand a per-\nfect statutory fit, rather than the \"congruence and proportionality\"\nrequired by the Supreme Court, Title II’s abrogation of state sover-\neign immunity remains well within Congress’s § 5 authority.\n\n                                    III.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, I see Title II’s abrogation of sovereign\nimmunity as passing constitutional muster. I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
