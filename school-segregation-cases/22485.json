It has been prepared by the Office of the Clerk for the\nconvenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor approved by the Supreme Court. Please note that, in the\ninterest of brevity, portions of any opinion may not have been summarized).\n\n      IMO Proposed Quest Academy Charter School of Montclair Founders Group (A-12-12) (070972)\n\nArgued September 9, 2013 -- Decided December 16, 2013\n\nLaVECCHIA, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\n\n         In this appeal, the Court considers the standard of review applicable to the Commissioner of Education’s\ndecision to deny a charter school application and the propriety of that decision.\n\n          The Charter School Program Act of 1995 (the Act), N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to -18, authorizes the\nestablishment of charter schools in New Jersey. The Act charges the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner)\nwith the responsibility to establish a program to “provide for the approval and granting of charters to charter schools\npursuant to [the Act].” N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-3. The application process is governed by the Act, see N.J.S.A.\n18A:36A-4, -4.1, -5, and implementing regulations, see N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1. Each charter school application must\nbe submitted not only to the Commissioner, but also to the local board of education for a recommendation to the\nCommissioner. The Commissioner has the “final authority to grant or reject a charter application.” N.J.S.A.\n18A:36A-4(c). Although the statutory and regulatory programmatic requirements provide no guidance to the\nCommissioner on how to assess an application, case law requires the Commissioner to (1) avoid segregation\nresulting from the grant of a charter school application and (2) evaluate the impact that loss of funds would have on\nthe local school district’s ability to deliver a thorough and efficient education. In re Grant of Charter Sch.\nApplication of Englewood on the Palisades Charter Sch. (Englewood on the Palisades II), 164 N.J. 316 (2000).\n\n           On October 15, 2010, Tracey Williams, on behalf of a group of founders, submitted an application to the\nCommissioner to open Quest Academy, a proposed charter high school in Montclair. On December 6, 2010,\nWilliams received an email response from the State Department of Education (Department) stating that certain\nsections of the application were incomplete, insufficient, or unclear, pointing out specific deficiencies in the\napplication, and providing an opportunity to address the deficiencies through the submission of further information.\nAlso on December 6, 2010, Dr. Frank Alvarez, Superintendent of the Montclair Public Schools, provided the\nCommissioner comments on the Quest Academy application on behalf of the local board of education. Dr. Alvarez\naddressed the negative financial impact that the proposed charter school would have on the Montclair School\nDistrict and criticized the application for containing inadequate and unclear information on course requirements,\ngraduation requirements, and curriculum development. Quest Academy submitted additional materials on\nDecember 14, 2010. On January 18, 2011, the Commissioner sent a brief, form-like letter to Williams stating that,\n“based on recommendations and my review, I am denying your request because of the deficiencies in your\napplication.” Although there was no further detail regarding the deficiencies, the letter informed Williams that the\nDepartment had additional information regarding her application and invited her to arrange an appointment with\nstaff to review the additional information and to register for a Department training program on preparing charter\nschool applications.\n\n          Williams filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate Division on February 24, 2011. On June 6, 2011, the\nCommissioner submitted an amplification of reasons for the denial to the Appellate Division. The Commissioner\ncharacterized Quest Academy’s education plan as weak and discussed content and programmatic deficiencies,\nincluding that Quest Academy failed to present a comprehensive and fully integrated educational program and that\nits strategies were neither connected to, nor supportive of, the proposed educational program. The Commissioner\nadded that, from her own experience, stand-alone charter high schools were particularly difficult to open and operate\nsuccessfully. She also expressed concern that a charter school might interfere with the existing desegregation order\nthat applies to the Montclair public schools. Finally, the letter cited criticisms voiced by Dr. Alvarez and\ncommunity members who had written unsolicited letters of opposition to the proposed charter school. The\nAppellate Division affirmed the Commissioner’s denial. The appellate panel stated that, because the Commissioner\ndid not act in a quasi-judicial capacity, it did not review the Commissioner’s decision under the substantial-credible-\n\fevidence standard, but rather under the standard of whether the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\nThe panel found that the Commissioner’s denial of Quest Academy’s application was not arbitrary, capricious, or\nunreasonable. The Court granted Williams’s petition for certification. 212 N.J. 288 (2012).\n\nHELD: The arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable standard of review is applicable to the Commissioner’s decision to\ngrant or deny a charter school application. The Commissioner’s decision to deny Quest Academy’s charter school\napplication was amply supported by the record and was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\n\n1. Because the Act does not confer a right to an administrative hearing for charter school applications, applicants\ncannot claim the right to a quasi-judicial administrative hearing as a “contested case” under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA), N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15. However, that does not end all inquiry into the nature of the\nproceedings before the Commissioner. The labels of “quasi-judicial” and “quasi-legislative” typically are used to\ndetermine whether an agency is obligated to provide an administrative adjudicative hearing, regardless of whether\nthe matter would merit the designation of a “contested case” under the APA. If the matter centers on the resolution\nof disputed adjudicative facts, if the parties are adverse, or if credibility determinations must be made, more formal\nadjudicatory-type proceedings must be provided (hence the quasi-judicial designation). The quasi-judicial and\nquasi-legislative labels have limits to their usefulness, however, because agencies must retain the ability to provide\nvarious informal, flexible procedures for determining certain issues that may not fit easily into either\ncharacterization. Importantly, the labels do not result in a meaningful difference in the role played by judicial\nreview of administrative determinations. (pp. 17-20)\n\n2. Reflecting the need to respect agency action taken pursuant to authority delegated by the Legislature, an appellate\ncourt may only reverse an agency decision if it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. In other words, a court may\nintervene when it is clear that the agency action is inconsistent with its mandate. That standard is applicable to\nadministrative agency actions regardless of whether they are quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. In addition, it is\ninarguable that the arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable standard requires that the administrative decision be\nsupported by the evidence in the record. (pp. 20-23)\n\n3. The Commissioner’s decision to deny Quest Academy’s application was amply supported by the record. The\nCourt does not second guess the educational judgments expressed in the Commissioner’s amplification. Moreover,\nthe analysis provided by Dr. Alvarez, which is required by the Act, was properly included in the record and was\nappropriately part of the Commissioner’s determination. It was also appropriate for the Commissioner to consider\nthe existing desegregation order pursuant to Englewood on the Palisades II. Finally, the Court finds no error in the\nCommissioner’s consideration of unsolicited letters from local citizens or her reliance on her own expertise in\nassessing the overall viability of the proposed charter school. Case law has recognized the value that administrative\nexpertise can play in making predictive or judgmental determinations. The Commissioner’s decision demonstrates a\nthoughtful and thorough weighing and judgment of the merits of Quest Academy’s application and does not warrant\njudicial intervention. (pp. 23-27)\n\n4. Rule 2:5-1(b) permits the filing of an amplification of reasons after an appeal has been filed and no objection was\nraised on the basis of the Rule’s time frames for such submissions. In addition, the Court accepts the\nCommissioner’s explanation for the manner of her initial response to the application. Although the letter of denial\ndid not detail the application’s deficiencies, it offered instead a face-to-face meeting to review the application in\ndetail. In reviewing a complex proposal for a charter school, there is a benefit to offering a discussion, instead of a\nwritten cataloguing, of mistakes or deficiencies in the application that has been rejected. The Court does not fault\nthe Commissioner for choosing a dialogue involving constructive criticism as her preferred approach for producing\napprovable applications when resubmitted. (pp. 27-28)\n\n         The judgment of the Appellate Division is AFFIRMED.\n\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER, JUSTICES ALBIN and PATTERSON, and JUDGES RODRÍGUEZ\nand CUFF (both temporarily assigned) join in JUSTICE LaVECCHIA’s opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           2\n\f                                       SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\n                                         A-12 September Term 2012\n                                                  070972\n\n\n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE\nPROPOSED QUEST ACADEMY\nCHARTER SCHOOL OF MONTCLAIR\nFOUNDERS GROUP.\n\n\n\n\n          Argued September 9, 2013 – Decided December 16, 2013\n\n          On certification to the Superior Court,\n          Appellate Division.\n\n          Michael J. Confusione argued the cause for\n          appellant Tracey Williams a member of Quest\n          Academy Charter School of Montclair Founders\n          Group (Hegge & Confusione, attorneys).\n\n          Michelle Lyn Miller, Assistant Attorney\n          General, argued the cause for respondent The\n          Commissioner of Education (John J. Hoffman,\n          Acting Attorney General; Lewis A.\n          Scheindlin, Assistant Attorney General, of\n          counsel; Diana C. Sierotowicz and Geoffrey\n          N. Stark, Deputies Attorney General, on the\n          briefs).\n\n\n    JUSTICE LaVECCHIA delivered the opinion for the Court.\n\n    The Charter School Program Act of 1995 (the Act), L. 1995,\n\nc. 426, §§ 1 to 18 (codified as amended at N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to\n\n-18), authorizes the establishment of charter schools in New\n\nJersey.   See N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-2 (finding that charter schools\n\n“can assist in promoting comprehensive educational reform” and\n\n\n                                 1\n\fthat their establishment “is in the best interests of the\n\nstudents of this State”).   The Act charges the Commissioner of\n\nEducation (Commissioner) with the responsibility to establish a\n\nprogram to “provide for the approval and granting of charters to\n\ncharter schools pursuant to [the Act].”    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-3.\n\nThe application process is governed by the Act, see N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-4, -4.1, -5, and implementing regulations, see N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:11-2.1.   Review of applications is conducted in accordance\n\nwith prescribed timing requirements that promote batched reviews\n\ntied to school cycles.   See N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1(b)(5), -2.1(f).\n\nUltimately, the Commissioner has the “final authority to grant\n\nor reject a charter application.”    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(c); see\n\nalso N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1(a).\n\n    In this matter, petitioner is one of the founders of the\n\nproposed Quest Academy Charter School of Montclair (Quest\n\nAcademy), which sought licensure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4\n\nto operate as a charter school for high school students.    The\n\nCommissioner denied the application in a writing that was short\n\non detail with respect to the application’s deficiencies.\n\nInstead, an offer to meet and discuss the application’s\n\nshortcomings was extended, as well as the opportunity to\n\nparticipate in a training program for preparing an application\n\nfor the upcoming application deadline.    Following petitioner’s\n\nfiling of a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division, the\n\n                                 2\n\fCommissioner issued a written amplification of reasons for\n\ndenial of the application.   The Appellate Division upheld the\n\nCommissioner’s action on the grounds that the decision was not\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\n\n    We granted certification to consider petitioner’s claim\n\nthat the Appellate Division misconstrued the standard of review\n\napplicable to the Commissioner’s decision.    We now affirm the\n\njudgment of the Appellate Division.   For clarity’s sake, we\n\nrestate the standard applicable in appellate review of agency\n\nactions and what is encompassed in that review; however, we\n\ndiscern no error in the appellate panel’s performance of its\n\nreview function here.   Further, like the Appellate Division, we\n\nsee no basis for interfering with the Commissioner’s use of a\n\nwritten amplification of reasons for her denial after\n\npetitioner’s appeal had been filed.\n\n                                I.\n\n    On October 15, 2010, petitioner Tracey Williams, on behalf\n\nof a group of founders, submitted an application to the\n\nCommissioner to open Quest Academy, a proposed charter high\n\nschool to serve pupils in grades nine through twelve with\n\napproximately eighty pupils per grade.    We digress briefly to\n\nexplain the regulatory process required for charter schools\n\nbefore addressing the Commissioner’s response to the Quest\n\nAcademy application.\n\n                                 3\n\f                               A.\n\n    Pursuant to the Act, a charter school application minimally\n\nmust include the following information:\n\n         a.

The educational goals of the charter\n         school, the curriculum to be offered, and\n         the methods of assessing whether students\n         are meeting educational goals.

Second, if the local\n\nschool district “demonstrates with some specificity that the\n\nconstitutional requirements of a thorough and efficient\n\neducation would be jeopardized by [the district’s] loss” of the\n\nfunds to be allocated to a charter school, “the Commissioner is\n\nobligated to evaluate carefully the impact that loss of funds\n\nwould have on the ability of the district of residence to\n\ndeliver a thorough and efficient education.”   Id. at 334-35; see\n\nN.J. Const. art. VIII, § 4, ¶ 1 (“The Legislature shall provide\n\nfor the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient\n\nsystem of free public schools for the instruction of all the\n\nchildren in the State between the ages of five and eighteen\n\nyears.”).\n\n                                B.\n\n     On December 6, 2010, approximately six weeks after Quest\n\nAcademy submitted its October 15 application, Ms. Williams\n\nreceived an email response from a representative of the State\n\nDepartment of Education, stating that certain sections of the\n\napplication were incomplete, insufficient, or unclear.      The\n\nresponse informed Quest Academy of specific deficiencies in its\n\napplication and afforded it the opportunity to address the\n\nconcerns raised through the submission of further information.\n\n                                 9\n\f    Also on December 6, 2010, in accordance with the Act, Dr.\n\nFrank Alvarez, Superintendent of the Montclair Public Schools,\n\nprovided comments on the Quest Academy application to the\n\nCommissioner on behalf of his local board of education.     Dr.\n\nAlvarez addressed the negative financial impact that the\n\nproposed charter school would have on the Montclair School\n\nDistrict in light of recent reductions in state aid and the\n\nDistrict’s reliance on local property taxes.   Substantively, Dr.\n\nAlvarez criticized the application for lacking clear information\n\non course requirements, inadequately addressing state high\n\nschool graduation requirements, and failing to specify a process\n\nof curriculum development in the nine areas of the state’s core\n\ncurriculum content standards.\n\n    Quest Academy submitted additional materials on December\n\n14, 2010, in response to the December 6 departmental request.\n\nThereafter, on January 3, 2011, Department representatives met\n\nwith Quest founders to discuss the application as augmented by\n\nthe addenda.\n\n    On January 18, 2011, the Commissioner sent a brief and\n\nrather form-like letter to Williams denying Quest Academy’s\n\napplication.   In it, the Commissioner referred to the forty-five\n\napplications that had been reviewed in the application cycle as\n\n“present[ing] varying degrees of readiness to successfully\n\nimplement exciting and educationally innovative models to\n\n                                10\n\fenhance student achievement,” but tersely informed Williams\n\nthat, “based on recommendations and my review, I am denying your\n\nrequest because of the deficiencies in your application.”       There\n\nwas no further detail on those deficiencies in the denial\n\nletter.\n\n    The letter provided other important information, however.\n\nIt advised Williams of her right to appeal the Commissioner’s\n\ndenial.   It informed Williams that the Department had additional\n\ninformation regarding Quest’s application and invited her to\n\ncall to arrange an appointment with staff to review the\n\nadditional information.   The letter further informed Williams\n\nthat training was available to assist individuals with\n\npreparation of charter school applications for the next charter\n\nschool application deadline, which was March 31, 2011.    The\n\nletter invited Williams and the founders to register for the\n\ntraining program offered by the Department for the upcoming\n\napplication deadline.\n\n    Williams, acting pro se, filed a notice of appeal with the\n\nAppellate Division on February 24, 2011.\n\n    On June 6, 2011, the Commissioner submitted to the Clerk of\n\nthe Appellate Division an Amplification of Reasons for the\n\ndenial in the form of a letter from Carly Bolger, Director of\n\nthe Department’s Office of Charter Schools.   According to the\n\nAmplification, the Commissioner denied the application based on\n\n                                11\n\fits overall lack of quality, as expressed in the initial letter.\n\nIn the Amplification, the Commissioner expanded upon her\n\nconcerns.\n\n    The Commissioner characterized Quest Academy’s education\n\nplan as weak, discerning content and programmatic deficiencies\n\nin several aspects of the proposed program.    Specifically, the\n\nCommissioner noted that\n\n            Quest’s educational plan . . . incorporated\n            many different strategies, programs, and\n            philosophies, but failed to present these\n            varied ideas as a comprehensive and fully\n            integrated educational school program.     In\n            particular,   the    goals   and   objectives\n            presented in the plan were weak. . . .\n            Moreover, the Commissioner found that the\n            strategies presented by Quest were neither\n            connected   to,   nor   supportive  of,   the\n            proposed educational program.\n\n    The Commissioner added that, from her own experience, she\n\nbelieved that stand-alone charter high schools were particularly\n\ndifficult to open and operate successfully.    She questioned the\n\nability of the school to attract sufficient students in the\n\nsmall community of Montclair, and expressed concern that a\n\ncharter school might interfere with Montclair’s desegregation\n\nefforts.    The letter cited criticisms voiced by Dr. Alvarez and\n\ncommunity members who had written unsolicited letters of\n\nopposition to the proposed charter school.    Those criticisms\n\nquestioned the capacity and qualifications of Quest’s founders;\n\nthe potential negative impact on the quality of programs and\n\n                                 12\n\feducational offerings at Montclair public schools; a lack of\n\ncommunity support for, or interest in, a charter school and,\n\nconversely, strong community support for the public high school;\n\nand the lack of an adequate facility to house the proposed\n\ncharter school.\n\n    According to the Amplification, based on the entirety of\n\nthose considerations, the Commissioner had determined that\n\nQuest’s application did not have a high probability of success.\n\nShe therefore had denied the application.\n\n                                C.\n\n    On appeal before the Appellate Division, petitioner’s\n\ncriticisms focused on the Commissioner’s review procedures and\n\nthe specific information used by the Commissioner in her\n\nevaluation of the application, including the information\n\nprovided through Dr. Alvarez’s evaluation, the citizen letters,\n\nand the existing desegregation order that applied to the\n\nMontclair public schools.   In addition, petitioner contended\n\nthat the federal No Child Left Behind Act, 20 U.S.C.A. § 6316,\n\nrequired the Commissioner to approve charter school applications\n\nin districts, like Montclair, that had been identified as in\n\nneed of improvement.\n\n    In response, the Commissioner addressed the propriety of\n\nthe information that she had considered in connection with the\n\napplication, countered the argument that the No Child Left\n\n                                13\n\fBehind Act had applicability in this setting, and urged the\n\nAppellate Division to affirm her determination because the\n\nadministrative decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or\n\nunreasonable.\n\n    The Appellate Division affirmed the Commissioner’s denial\n\nin an unpublished decision.   The court noted that a deferential\n\nstandard of review applied to its review of the Commissioner’s\n\naction in this matter.   Quoting In re Grant of Charter Sch.\n\nApplication of Englewood on the Palisades Charter Sch., 320 N.J.\n\nSuper. 174, 217 (App. Div. 1999), aff’d as modified, 164 N.J.\n\n316 (2000), the court stated that, because the Commissioner\n\n“[did] not act in a quasi-judicial capacity,” the appellate\n\npanel “‘[did] not review the Commissioner’s decision under the\n\nsubstantial-credible-evidence standard, but rather under the\n\nstandard of whether the decision is arbitrary, capricious or\n\nunreasonable.’”\n\n    Turning to the record that the Commissioner considered in\n\nmaking her determination, the appellate panel found that the\n\nCommissioner did not act improperly in considering Dr. Alvarez’s\n\nviews, the opposition letters from Montclair citizens, or the\n\ndesegregation order.   The panel held that, based on the record,\n\nthe Commissioner’s denial of Quest Academy’s application was not\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.   The court specifically\n\nrejected petitioner’s argument that the federal No Child Left\n\n                                14\n\fBehind Act, 20 U.S.C.A. § 6316, requires the Commissioner to\n\napprove charter school applications in districts identified as\n\nin need of improvement.   Petitioner’s other arguments were\n\nsummarily rejected.\n\n    With the assistance of counsel, Williams filed a petition\n\nfor certification, which was granted.   212 N.J. 288 (2012).\n\n                                II.\n\n    Before this Court, petitioner’s arguments are refined.\n\nFocusing primarily on the standard of review, she zeros in on\n\ntwo sentences in the Appellate Division’s decision and claims\n\nthat the panel reviewed the Commissioner’s determination under a\n\nmisapprehension of the correct standard for appellate review.\n\nShe contends that an appellate court reviewing a denial of a\n\ncharter school application must consider whether the decision\n\nwas supported by “substantial credible evidence,” not simply\n\nwhether it was “arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable” as the\n\nAppellate Division said in its decision.   She further argues\n\nthat the Commissioner should be required to provide written\n\nreasons for a denial at the time the decision is made, and that\n\nan Amplification of Reasons given after a decision is appealed\n\nshould not be allowed.    Consistent with those criticisms,\n\npetitioner claims that due process was violated because the\n\ndecision, when issued, was not supported by substantial credible\n\nevidence.\n\n                                 15\n\f    The Commissioner argues that the Appellate Division\n\ncorrectly applied an arbitrary and capricious standard of\n\nreview.    She further argues that the panel appropriately\n\ndetermined that the Commissioner’s denial procedurally was\n\ncompliant with law and substantively was not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable.\n\n    More specifically, the Commissioner characterizes her\n\ndecision to deny a charter school application as quasi-\n\nlegislative, distinguishing it from quasi-judicial actions.      The\n\nCommissioner points out that the Act does not require the\n\nCommissioner to conduct a hearing and none is required by due\n\nprocess.   The Commissioner and the applicant do not have an\n\nadversarial relationship and the Commissioner is not required,\n\nin deciding whether to grant a charter school application, to\n\nweigh opposing parties’ evidence or make credibility\n\ndeterminations.   Therefore, the Commissioner maintains that this\n\nappeal does not involve review of quasi-judicial action.\n\nInstead, she relies on case law that states that quasi-\n\nlegislative decisions are reviewed under the arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable standard.   Further, the Commissioner\n\ncontends that, subsumed in that standard, are the requirements\n\nthat the Commissioner’s decision demonstrate a thorough review\n\nof the record and that the decision reached have sufficient\n\nsupport in the record to sustain it.    Both requirements, she\n\n                                 16\n\fcontends, are met here.   Further, in response to petitioner’s\n\nobjection to the Commissioner’s amplification of reasons for her\n\ndecision, the Commissioner cites Rule 2:5-1(b), which permits a\n\njudge, officer, or agency to file an amplification of a prior\n\ndecision if it is appealed, as authority for her action.\n\n                                III.\n\n                                 A.\n\n    Judicial review of administrative agency action is a matter\n\nof constitutional right in New Jersey.   See N.J. Const. art. VI,\n\n§ 5, ¶ 4 (allocating relief from agency actions to “the Superior\n\nCourt, on terms and in the manner provided by rules of the\n\nSupreme Court, as of right”).   Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) provides for\n\nreview of “final decisions or actions of any state\n\nadministrative agency or officer” in the Appellate Division of\n\nthe Superior Court.\n\n    Through N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(c), the Legislature has decreed\n\nthat the Commissioner is the final administrative decision-maker\n\non the grant or rejection of a charter school application.\n\nThus, an applicant has the right to appeal the Commissioner’s\n\nrejection of a charter school application pursuant to Rule 2:2-\n\n3(a)(2).   The Act also confers on an unsuccessful applicant a\n\nstatutory right to appeal.   See N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(d)\n\n(conferring statutory right to appeal to Appellate Division of\n\nSuperior Court on charter school applicant and local board of\n\n                                 17\n\feducation).\n\n     While the Act grants to a denied applicant a statutory\n\nright to appeal, it does not confer a right to an administrative\n\nhearing.   That has the consequence of denying a rejected\n\napplicant the ability to claim the right, under the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15, to\n\na quasi-judicial administrative hearing governed by APA\n\nstandards for a “contested case.”    See N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2\n\n(defining “contested case” as “a proceeding . . . in which the\n\nlegal rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits or other\n\nlegal relations of specific parties are required by\n\nconstitutional right or by statute to be determined by an agency\n\nby decisions, determinations, or orders, addressed to them or\n\ndisposing of their interests, after opportunity for an agency\n\nhearing”).3   However, that does not end all inquiry into the\n\nnature of the proceedings before the Commissioner when reviewing\n\nan application to operate a charter school.\n\n     The labels of “quasi-judicial” and “quasi-legislative”\n\ntypically are used to determine whether the agency is obligated\n\nto provide an administrative adjudicative hearing, regardless of\n\nwhether the matter would merit the designation of a “contested\n\ncase” under the APA.   See Cunningham v. Dep’t of Civil Serv., 69\n\n\n3\n  The applicant has not asserted a substantive constitutional\nright.\n                                18\n\fN.J. 13, 20 (1975) (using such labels in explaining when,\n\noutside of APA requirements, right to trial-like hearing exists\n\nas matter of fundamental fairness and administrative due\n\nprocess).   If the matter centers on the resolution of disputed\n\nadjudicative facts, if the parties are adverse, or if\n\ncredibility determinations must be made, more formal\n\nadjudicatory-type proceedings must be provided (hence the quasi-\n\njudicial designation).   See, e.g., High Horizons Dev. Co. v.\n\nN.J. Dep’t of Transp., 120 N.J. 40, 49-51 (1990) (discussing\n\nwhen need arises for trial-like, adjudicatory process).       The\n\nmost important procedural rights in such proceedings are\n\nadequate notice, a chance to know opposing evidence, and the\n\nopportunity to present evidence and argument in response.         Id.\n\nat 52-53.\n\n    Such labels as quasi-adjudicative and quasi-legislative\n\nhave limits to their usefulness.     Indeed, this Court has\n\nrecognized that agencies must retain the ability to provide\n\nvarious informal, flexible procedures for determining certain\n\nissues or taking certain actions.     Ibid.   In all instances,\n\nfundamental due process requirements of notice and opportunity\n\nto be heard must be satisfied, even though the contours of their\n\nsatisfaction may vary.   See id. at 51-54 (reviewing property\n\nowner’s criticism of procedural fairness in Commissioner of\n\nTransportation’s handling of application for highway access\n\n                                19\n\fpermit).     As in the matter presently before this Court, High\n\nHorizons involved a due process challenge in a matter that did\n\nnot fit easily into classifications of whether an agency was\n\nacting in a judicial or “quasi-judicial” capacity, or in a\n\nlegislative or “quasi-legislative” capacity.      Id. at 50-51.\n\nImportantly, the labels do not result in a meaningful difference\n\nin the role played by judicial review of administrative\n\ndeterminations.    The “core value[] of judicial review of\n\nadministrative action is the furtherance of accountability.”\n\nId. at 53.\n\n                                  B.\n\n    Reflecting the need to respect agency action taken pursuant\n\nto authority delegated by the Legislature, the standard for\n\njudicial review of administrative agency action is limited:       An\n\nappellate court may reverse an agency decision if it is\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.      See In re Petition for\n\nRulemaking, 117 N.J. 311, 325 (1989).      In other words, a court\n\nmay intervene when “it is clear that the agency action is\n\ninconsistent with its mandate.”    Ibid.    Indeed, the test often\n\nis expressed in the negative.    See, e.g., Brady v. Bd. of\n\nReview, 152 N.J. 197, 210 (1997) (“Unless a Court finds that the\n\nagency’s action was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, the\n\nagency’s ruling should not be disturbed.”).      The test, although\n\ndeferential, does not lack content.    As this Court has stated on\n\n                                  20\n\fmany occasions,\n\n             [a]lthough sometimes phrased in terms of a\n             search for arbitrary or unreasonable agency\n             action, the judicial role [in reviewing an\n             agency action] is generally restricted to\n             three inquiries: (1) whether the agency’s\n             action    violates   express   or   implied\n             legislative policies, that is, did the\n             agency follow the law; (2) whether the\n             record contains substantial evidence to\n             support the findings on which the agency\n             based   its action; and (3) whether in\n             applying the legislative policies to the\n             facts, the agency clearly erred in reaching\n             a conclusion that could not reasonably have\n             been made on a showing of the relevant\n             factors.\n\n             [Mazza v.   Bd.   of   Trs.,   143   N.J.   22,   25\n             (1995).]\n\nSee, e.g., In re Stallworth, 208 N.J. 182, 194 (2011); N.J.\n\nSoc’y for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. N.J. Dep’t of\n\nAgric., 196 N.J. 366, 384-85 (2008); In re Carter, 191 N.J. 474,\n\n482-83 (2007); Dennery v. Bd. of Educ., 131 N.J. 626, 641\n\n(1993); In re Petition for Rulemaking, supra, 117 N.J. at 325;\n\nHenry v. Rahway State Prison, 81 N.J. 571, 579-80 (1980).\n\n     The standard is applicable to administrative agency actions\n\nregardless of whether they are quasi-legislative or quasi-\n\njudicial.4    Examples demonstrate the test’s applicability to a\n\nquasi-legislative rulemaking context, see, e.g., N.J. Soc’y for\n\n4\n  Some cases have made this standard for judicial review of\nagency action a four-part inquiry. See, e.g., Brady, supra, 152\nN.J. at 210-11 (separating duty to follow law into two\ninquiries, one legislative and one constitutional). We adhere\nto the test as formulated in Mazza.\n                                     21\n\fPrevention of Cruelty to Animals, supra, 196 N.J. at 384-85; In\n\nre Petition for Rulemaking, supra, 117 N.J. at 325; Public Serv.\n\nElec. & Gas Co. v. N.J. Dep’t of Envtl. Prot., 101 N.J. 95, 103\n\n(1985), as well as to a quasi-judicial context, see, e.g.,\n\nMazza, supra 143 N.J. at 25; Dennery, supra, 131 N.J. at 641;\n\nExec. Comm’n on Ethical Standards v. Salmon, 295 N.J. Super. 86,\n\n96-97 (App. Div. 1996).\n\n    In this matter, both parties concede that the arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable standard applicable in the review of\n\nadministrative agency decisions subsumes the need to find\n\nsufficient support in the record to sustain the decision reached\n\nby the Commissioner.   The point is beyond argument, for a\n\nfailure to consider all the evidence in a record would perforce\n\nlead to arbitrary decision making.   See, e.g., Close v. Kordulak\n\nBros., 44 N.J. 589, 599 (1965) (noting that “the proofs as a\n\nwhole” must be considered); Green v. State Health Benefits\n\nComm’n, 373 N.J. Super. 408, 415 (App. Div. 2004) (finding\n\nagency decision that failed to address issues raised in key\n\ndocuments in record arbitrary and capricious).   Moreover, a\n\ndecision based on a complete misperception of the facts\n\nsubmitted in a record would render the agency’s conclusion\n\nunreasonable.   See, e.g., Clowes v. Terminix Int’l, Inc., 109\n\nN.J. 575, 588-89 (1988) (stating that appellate court should\n\nintervene where agency’s “finding is clearly a mistaken one”);\n\n                                22\n\fConstantino v. N.J. Merit Sys. Bd., 313 N.J. Super. 212, 218\n\n(App. Div.) (reversing board’s decision where findings were\n\nunsupported by record, based on “total disregard” of facts,\n\nagainst “overwhelming weight” of testimony, and based on record\n\n“skew[ed]” by administrative law judge), certif. denied, 157\n\nN.J. 544 (1998).     Plainly, the standard requires that the\n\nadministrative decision be supported by the underlying record,\n\nregardless of the manner in which due process requires that the\n\nrecord be created.    The obligation that there be substantial\n\nevidence in the record requires a sifting of the record, and the\n\nability to find support for the conclusions reached by the\n\nCommissioner under the statutory framework within which she must\n\nact.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n                                  A.\n\n       The statutory and regulatory scheme for the approval of\n\napplications to operate a charter school functions under tight\n\ntime frames as cycle after cycle of charter school applications\n\nare submitted seeking approval to open in the ensuing school\n\nyear.   N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1(b)(1).      The regulatory scheme operates\n\nunder the expectation that an application either will be\n\napproved through phases one and two of the review process and\n\nmove on for implementation in the upcoming school year, or will\n\nrequire retooling and resubmission.       N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1.   The\n\n                                  23\n\fDepartment, as noted in Quest’s denial letter, assists\n\napplicants with the application process by offering training\n\nprograms in how to prepare applications for review.\n\n       That said, the applications arrive in batches and must be\n\nreviewed and resolved in a timely fashion in order to proceed to\n\nimplementation in the next school year.     See ibid.   At oral\n\nargument, the Attorney General, arguing for the Commissioner,\n\nrepresented to the Court that the Commissioner is exceedingly\n\ncareful in the approval of charter schools because of the impact\n\nthat a wrong decision will have on students who attend a charter\n\nschool that falters, or worse, fails to provide an educational\n\nprogram that satisfies the constitutional standard of a thorough\n\nand efficient education.    See Englewood on the Palisades II,\n\nsupra, 164 N.J. at 323, 336 (stating obligation to provide\n\n“thorough and efficient system of education” and holding that\n\nCommissioner must assess economic impact of proposed charter\n\nschool on district of residence).     We are appreciative of the\n\nimportance that must be ascribed to the Commissioner’s approval\n\nof a charter school and that, nevertheless, such reviews must\n\nproceed expeditiously.\n\n       Turning to the merits of the Commissioner’s determination\n\nin respect of Quest Academy’s application, we find that the\n\nCommissioner’s decision was amply supported by the record before\n\nher.    We do not second guess the educational judgments expressed\n\n                                 24\n\fin the Amplification letter issued on behalf of the\n\nCommissioner, such as her findings that Quest Academy “failed to\n\npresent . . . a comprehensive and fully integrated educational\n\nprogram” and that “the strategies presented by Quest were\n\nneither connected to, nor supportive of, the proposed\n\neducational program.”    Moreover, as envisioned by the\n\nLegislature, that record properly included relevant submissions\n\nnecessary for proper consideration and allowance of a charter\n\nschool to operate.    Specifically, we refer to the analysis\n\nprovided by the local superintendent of schools, which is\n\nrequired to be submitted by N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(c) and N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:11-2.1(d).   In addition, in Englewood on the Palisades II,\n\nsupra, we stated that the Commissioner was obliged to consider\n\nwhether an impacted local school district had demonstrated “with\n\nsome specificity that the constitutional requirements of a\n\nthorough and efficient education would be jeopardized by [the\n\ndistrict’s] loss” of the funds to be allocated to a charter\n\nschool, and that the Commissioner was “obligated to evaluate\n\ncarefully the impact that loss of funds would have on the\n\nability of the district of residence to deliver a thorough and\n\nefficient education” when considering whether or not to approve\n\nthe charter school.     164 N.J. at 334-35.   The information in Dr.\n\nAlvarez’s submission was appropriately part of the\n\nCommissioner’s determination.    We add that Quest Academy was\n\n                                  25\n\fentitled to respond to it by way of argument, at the least,\n\nwithin the tight time frames permitted in the review process,\n\nand through any subsequent resubmission of the application.\n\n    In addition, petitioner’s objection to the Commissioner’s\n\nreliance on the existing desegregation order as a factor to\n\nconsider in rejecting the application lacks merit.    Again, in\n\nEnglewood on the Palisades II, supra, we stated that “the\n\nCommissioner must assess the racial impact that a charter school\n\napplicant will have on the district of residence in which the\n\ncharter school will operate” and “must use the full panoply of\n\n[her] powers to avoid” segregation resulting from the grant of a\n\ncharter school application.   164 N.J. at 329.\n\n    Finally, we see no error in the Commissioner’s\n\nconsideration of unsolicited letters from local citizens or her\n\nreliance on her own expertise in assessing overall viability of\n\nthis proposed charter school.   In making predictive or\n\njudgmental determinations, case law has recognized the value\n\nthat administrative expertise can play in the rendering of a\n\nsound administrative determination.   Judicial deference is at a\n\nhigh when reviewing such findings.    See, e.g., Golden Nugget\n\nAtl. City Corp. v. Atl. City Elec. Co., 229 N.J. Super. 118,\n\n122-23 (App. Div. 1988).\n\n    The Commissioner’s decision -- but only as it was amplified\n\n-- demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough weighing and judgment\n\n                                26\n\fof the merits of the Quest Academy application.    There is no\n\nright to operate a charter school.    There is only the\n\nopportunity to apply for approval to operate one if the\n\napplication demonstrates proper merit.    The burden is on the\n\napplicant to show that it can meet the requirements for\n\nobtaining permission to educate public school children in a\n\ncharter school setting.    The Commissioner’s review and rejection\n\nof this application is sustainable on the record she had before\n\nher.    There is no basis for judicial intervention.\n\n                                 B.\n\n       We add only a brief comment about the Commissioner’s\n\namplification.   Rule 2:5-1(b) expressly permits its filing after\n\na notice of appeal has been filed.    Indeed, the Rule anticipates\n\nthat amplification may occur after an appeal has been filed.      To\n\nthe extent that there are time frames for its submission set\n\nforth in the Court Rule, we note that no objection was raised on\n\nthe basis of the Rule’s time frames for such submissions, which\n\nare designed to prevent delay in the processing of appeals.\n\n       We add that we accept the Commissioner’s explanation for\n\nher manner of responding to applicants.    Although the letter of\n\ndenial did not detail the deficiencies found in the application,\n\nit offered instead a face-to-face meeting to review in detail\n\nthe shortcomings in the application that Quest Academy\n\nsubmitted.    According to the Commissioner, the large number of\n\n                                 27\n\fapplicants (forty-five) who were reviewed in the batch with\n\nQuest Academy rendered lengthy written responses difficult and\n\ntaxing of precious departmental resources.   While it would be\n\nnaturally preferable from the applicant’s perspective to receive\n\ninitially more than a generic form letter denying an\n\napplication, here Quest Academy received a bit more than that.\n\nSome information about the application’s shortcomings was\n\nprovided in the denial letter, and the subsequent amplification\n\nfully detailed those issues.   In reviewing as complex a proposal\n\nas that required for a newly proposed charter school, there is a\n\nbenefit to offering a discussion, instead of a written\n\ncataloguing, of mistakes or deficiencies in the application that\n\nhas been rejected.   We do not fault the Commissioner for\n\nchoosing a dialogue involving constructive criticism as her\n\npreferred approach for producing approvable applications when\n\nresubmitted.\n\n                                V.\n\n    The judgment of the Appellate Division, affirming the\n\nCommissioner of Education’s denial of the charter school\n\napplication of Quest Academy, is affirmed.\n\n     CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER, and JUSTICES ALBIN and PATTERSON, and\nJUDGES RODRÍGUEZ and CUFF (both temporarily assigned) join in\nJUSTICE LaVECCHIA’s opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                28\n\f             SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\n\nNO.

It has been prepared by the Office of the Clerk for the\nconvenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor approved by the Supreme Court. Please note that, in the\ninterest of brevity, portions of any opinion may not have been summarized).\n\n      IMO Proposed Quest Academy Charter School of Montclair Founders Group (A-12-12) (070972)\n\nArgued September 9, 2013 -- Decided December 16, 2013\n\nLaVECCHIA, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\n\n         In this appeal, the Court considers the standard of review applicable to the Commissioner of Education’s\ndecision to deny a charter school application and the propriety of that decision.\n\n          The Charter School Program Act of 1995 (the Act), N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to -18, authorizes the\nestablishment of charter schools in New Jersey. The Act charges the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner)\nwith the responsibility to establish a program to “provide for the approval and granting of charters to charter schools\npursuant to [the Act].” N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-3. The application process is governed by the Act, see N.J.S.A.\n18A:36A-4, -4.1, -5, and implementing regulations, see N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1. Each charter school application must\nbe submitted not only to the Commissioner, but also to the local board of education for a recommendation to the\nCommissioner. The Commissioner has the “final authority to grant or reject a charter application.” N.J.S.A.\n18A:36A-4(c). Although the statutory and regulatory programmatic requirements provide no guidance to the\nCommissioner on how to assess an application, case law requires the Commissioner to (1) avoid segregation\nresulting from the grant of a charter school application and (2) evaluate the impact that loss of funds would have on\nthe local school district’s ability to deliver a thorough and efficient education. In re Grant of Charter Sch.\nApplication of Englewood on the Palisades Charter Sch. (Englewood on the Palisades II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1891380\"><a href=\"/opinion/1891380/in-re-grant-of-charter-school-appl/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).\n\n           On October 15, 2010, Tracey Williams, on behalf of a group of founders, submitted an application to the\nCommissioner to open Quest Academy, a proposed charter high school in Montclair. On December 6, 2010,\nWilliams received an email response from the State Department of Education (Department) stating that certain\nsections of the application were incomplete, insufficient, or unclear, pointing out specific deficiencies in the\napplication, and providing an opportunity to address the deficiencies through the submission of further information.\nAlso on December 6, 2010, Dr. Frank Alvarez, Superintendent of the Montclair Public Schools, provided the\nCommissioner comments on the Quest Academy application on behalf of the local board of education. Dr. Alvarez\naddressed the negative financial impact that the proposed charter school would have on the Montclair School\nDistrict and criticized the application for containing inadequate and unclear information on course requirements,\ngraduation requirements, and curriculum development. Quest Academy submitted additional materials on\nDecember 14, 2010. On January 18, 2011, the Commissioner sent a brief, form-like letter to Williams stating that,\n“based on recommendations and my review, I am denying your request because of the deficiencies in your\napplication.” Although there was no further detail regarding the deficiencies, the letter informed Williams that the\nDepartment had additional information regarding her application and invited her to arrange an appointment with\nstaff to review the additional information and to register for a Department training program on preparing charter\nschool applications.\n\n          Williams filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate Division on February 24, 2011. On June 6, 2011, the\nCommissioner submitted an amplification of reasons for the denial to the Appellate Division. The Commissioner\ncharacterized Quest Academy’s education plan as weak and discussed content and programmatic deficiencies,\nincluding that Quest Academy failed to present a comprehensive and fully integrated educational program and that\nits strategies were neither connected to, nor supportive of, the proposed educational program. The Commissioner\nadded that, from her own experience, stand-alone charter high schools were particularly difficult to open and operate\nsuccessfully. She also expressed concern that a charter school might interfere with the existing desegregation order\nthat applies to the Montclair public schools. Finally, the letter cited criticisms voiced by Dr. Alvarez and\ncommunity members who had written unsolicited letters of opposition to the proposed charter school. The\nAppellate Division affirmed the Commissioner’s denial. The appellate panel stated that, because the Commissioner\ndid not act in a quasi-judicial capacity, it did not review the Commissioner’s decision under the substantial-credible-\n\fevidence standard, but rather under the standard of whether the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\nThe panel found that the Commissioner’s denial of Quest Academy’s application was not arbitrary, capricious, or\nunreasonable. The Court granted Williams’s petition for certification. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012).\n\nHELD: The arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable standard of review is applicable to the Commissioner’s decision to\ngrant or deny a charter school application. The Commissioner’s decision to deny Quest Academy’s charter school\napplication was amply supported by the record and was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\n\n1. Because the Act does not confer a right to an administrative hearing for charter school applications, applicants\ncannot claim the right to a quasi-judicial administrative hearing as a “contested case” under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA), N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15. However, that does not end all inquiry into the nature of the\nproceedings before the Commissioner. The labels of “quasi-judicial” and “quasi-legislative” typically are used to\ndetermine whether an agency is obligated to provide an administrative adjudicative hearing, regardless of whether\nthe matter would merit the designation of a “contested case” under the APA. If the matter centers on the resolution\nof disputed adjudicative facts, if the parties are adverse, or if credibility determinations must be made, more formal\nadjudicatory-type proceedings must be provided (hence the quasi-judicial designation). The quasi-judicial and\nquasi-legislative labels have limits to their usefulness, however, because agencies must retain the ability to provide\nvarious informal, flexible procedures for determining certain issues that may not fit easily into either\ncharacterization. Importantly, the labels do not result in a meaningful difference in the role played by judicial\nreview of administrative determinations. (pp. 17-20)\n\n2. Reflecting the need to respect agency action taken pursuant to authority delegated by the Legislature, an appellate\ncourt may only reverse an agency decision if it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. In other words, a court may\nintervene when it is clear that the agency action is inconsistent with its mandate. That standard is applicable to\nadministrative agency actions regardless of whether they are quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. In addition, it is\ninarguable that the arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable standard requires that the administrative decision be\nsupported by the evidence in the record. (pp. 20-23)\n\n3. The Commissioner’s decision to deny Quest Academy’s application was amply supported by the record. The\nCourt does not second guess the educational judgments expressed in the Commissioner’s amplification. Moreover,\nthe analysis provided by Dr. Alvarez, which is required by the Act, was properly included in the record and was\nappropriately part of the Commissioner’s determination. It was also appropriate for the Commissioner to consider\nthe existing desegregation order pursuant to Englewood on the Palisades II. Finally, the Court finds no error in the\nCommissioner’s consideration of unsolicited letters from local citizens or her reliance on her own expertise in\nassessing the overall viability of the proposed charter school. Case law has recognized the value that administrative\nexpertise can play in making predictive or judgmental determinations. The Commissioner’s decision demonstrates a\nthoughtful and thorough weighing and judgment of the merits of Quest Academy’s application and does not warrant\njudicial intervention. (pp. 23-27)\n\n4. Rule 2:5-1(b) permits the filing of an amplification of reasons after an appeal has been filed and no objection was\nraised on the basis of the Rule’s time frames for such submissions. In addition, the Court accepts the\nCommissioner’s explanation for the manner of her initial response to the application. Although the letter of denial\ndid not detail the application’s deficiencies, it offered instead a face-to-face meeting to review the application in\ndetail. In reviewing a complex proposal for a charter school, there is a benefit to offering a discussion, instead of a\nwritten cataloguing, of mistakes or deficiencies in the application that has been rejected. The Court does not fault\nthe Commissioner for choosing a dialogue involving constructive criticism as her preferred approach for producing\napprovable applications when resubmitted.

Stark, Deputies Attorney General, on the\n          briefs).\n\n\n    JUSTICE LaVECCHIA delivered the opinion for the Court.\n\n    The Charter School Program Act of 1995 (the Act), L. 1995,\n\nc. 426, §§ 1 to 18 (codified as amended at N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to\n\n-18), authorizes the establishment of charter schools in New\n\nJersey.   See N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-2 (finding that charter schools\n\n“can assist in promoting comprehensive educational reform” and\n\n\n                                 1\n\fthat their establishment “is in the best interests of the\n\nstudents of this State”).   The Act charges the Commissioner of\n\nEducation (Commissioner) with the responsibility to establish a\n\nprogram to “provide for the approval and granting of charters to\n\ncharter schools pursuant to [the Act].”    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-3.\n\nThe application process is governed by the Act, see N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-4, -4.1, -5, and implementing regulations, see N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:11-2.1.   Review of applications is conducted in accordance\n\nwith prescribed timing requirements that promote batched reviews\n\ntied to school cycles.   See N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1(b)(5), -2.1(f).\n\nUltimately, the Commissioner has the “final authority to grant\n\nor reject a charter application.”    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(c); see\n\nalso N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1(a).\n\n    In this matter, petitioner is one of the founders of the\n\nproposed Quest Academy Charter School of Montclair (Quest\n\nAcademy), which sought licensure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4\n\nto operate as a charter school for high school students.    The\n\nCommissioner denied the application in a writing that was short\n\non detail with respect to the application’s deficiencies.\n\nInstead, an offer to meet and discuss the application’s\n\nshortcomings was extended, as well as the opportunity to\n\nparticipate in a training program for preparing an application\n\nfor the upcoming application deadline.    Following petitioner’s\n\nfiling of a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division, the\n\n                                 2\n\fCommissioner issued a written amplification of reasons for\n\ndenial of the application.   The Appellate Division upheld the\n\nCommissioner’s action on the grounds that the decision was not\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\n\n    We granted certification to consider petitioner’s claim\n\nthat the Appellate Division misconstrued the standard of review\n\napplicable to the Commissioner’s decision.    We now affirm the\n\njudgment of the Appellate Division.   For clarity’s sake, we\n\nrestate the standard applicable in appellate review of agency\n\nactions and what is encompassed in that review; however, we\n\ndiscern no error in the appellate panel’s performance of its\n\nreview function here.   Further, like the Appellate Division, we\n\nsee no basis for interfering with the Commissioner’s use of a\n\nwritten amplification of reasons for her denial after\n\npetitioner’s appeal had been filed.\n\n                                I.\n\n    On October 15, 2010, petitioner Tracey Williams, on behalf\n\nof a group of founders, submitted an application to the\n\nCommissioner to open Quest Academy, a proposed charter high\n\nschool to serve pupils in grades nine through twelve with\n\napproximately eighty pupils per grade.    We digress briefly to\n\nexplain the regulatory process required for charter schools\n\nbefore addressing the Commissioner’s response to the Quest\n\nAcademy application.\n\n                                 3\n\f                               A.\n\n    Pursuant to the Act, a charter school application minimally\n\nmust include the following information:\n\n         a.

Second, if the local\n\nschool district “demonstrates with some specificity that the\n\nconstitutional requirements of a thorough and efficient\n\neducation would be jeopardized by [the district’s] loss” of the\n\nfunds to be allocated to a charter school, “the Commissioner is\n\nobligated to evaluate carefully the impact that loss of funds\n\nwould have on the ability of the district of residence to\n\ndeliver a thorough and efficient education.”   Id. at 334-35; see\n\nN.J. Const. art. VIII, § 4, ¶ 1 (“The Legislature shall provide\n\nfor the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient\n\nsystem of free public schools for the instruction of all the\n\nchildren in the State between the ages of five and eighteen\n\nyears.”).\n\n                                B.\n\n     On December 6, 2010, approximately six weeks after Quest\n\nAcademy submitted its October 15 application, Ms. Williams\n\nreceived an email response from a representative of the State\n\nDepartment of Education, stating that certain sections of the\n\napplication were incomplete, insufficient, or unclear.      The\n\nresponse informed Quest Academy of specific deficiencies in its\n\napplication and afforded it the opportunity to address the\n\nconcerns raised through the submission of further information.\n\n                                 9\n\f    Also on December 6, 2010, in accordance with the Act, Dr.\n\nFrank Alvarez, Superintendent of the Montclair Public Schools,\n\nprovided comments on the Quest Academy application to the\n\nCommissioner on behalf of his local board of education.     Dr.\n\nAlvarez addressed the negative financial impact that the\n\nproposed charter school would have on the Montclair School\n\nDistrict in light of recent reductions in state aid and the\n\nDistrict’s reliance on local property taxes.   Substantively, Dr.\n\nAlvarez criticized the application for lacking clear information\n\non course requirements, inadequately addressing state high\n\nschool graduation requirements, and failing to specify a process\n\nof curriculum development in the nine areas of the state’s core\n\ncurriculum content standards.\n\n    Quest Academy submitted additional materials on December\n\n14, 2010, in response to the December 6 departmental request.\n\nThereafter, on January 3, 2011, Department representatives met\n\nwith Quest founders to discuss the application as augmented by\n\nthe addenda.\n\n    On January 18, 2011, the Commissioner sent a brief and\n\nrather form-like letter to Williams denying Quest Academy’s\n\napplication.   In it, the Commissioner referred to the forty-five\n\napplications that had been reviewed in the application cycle as\n\n“present[ing] varying degrees of readiness to successfully\n\nimplement exciting and educationally innovative models to\n\n                                10\n\fenhance student achievement,” but tersely informed Williams\n\nthat, “based on recommendations and my review, I am denying your\n\nrequest because of the deficiencies in your application.”       There\n\nwas no further detail on those deficiencies in the denial\n\nletter.\n\n    The letter provided other important information, however.\n\nIt advised Williams of her right to appeal the Commissioner’s\n\ndenial.   It informed Williams that the Department had additional\n\ninformation regarding Quest’s application and invited her to\n\ncall to arrange an appointment with staff to review the\n\nadditional information.   The letter further informed Williams\n\nthat training was available to assist individuals with\n\npreparation of charter school applications for the next charter\n\nschool application deadline, which was March 31, 2011.    The\n\nletter invited Williams and the founders to register for the\n\ntraining program offered by the Department for the upcoming\n\napplication deadline.\n\n    Williams, acting pro se, filed a notice of appeal with the\n\nAppellate Division on February 24, 2011.\n\n    On June 6, 2011, the Commissioner submitted to the Clerk of\n\nthe Appellate Division an Amplification of Reasons for the\n\ndenial in the form of a letter from Carly Bolger, Director of\n\nthe Department’s Office of Charter Schools.   According to the\n\nAmplification, the Commissioner denied the application based on\n\n                                11\n\fits overall lack of quality, as expressed in the initial letter.\n\nIn the Amplification, the Commissioner expanded upon her\n\nconcerns.\n\n    The Commissioner characterized Quest Academy’s education\n\nplan as weak, discerning content and programmatic deficiencies\n\nin several aspects of the proposed program.    Specifically, the\n\nCommissioner noted that\n\n            Quest’s educational plan . . . incorporated\n            many different strategies, programs, and\n            philosophies, but failed to present these\n            varied ideas as a comprehensive and fully\n            integrated educational school program.     In\n            particular,   the    goals   and   objectives\n            presented in the plan were weak. . . .\n            Moreover, the Commissioner found that the\n            strategies presented by Quest were neither\n            connected   to,   nor   supportive  of,   the\n            proposed educational program.\n\n    The Commissioner added that, from her own experience, she\n\nbelieved that stand-alone charter high schools were particularly\n\ndifficult to open and operate successfully.    She questioned the\n\nability of the school to attract sufficient students in the\n\nsmall community of Montclair, and expressed concern that a\n\ncharter school might interfere with Montclair’s desegregation\n\nefforts.    The letter cited criticisms voiced by Dr. Alvarez and\n\ncommunity members who had written unsolicited letters of\n\nopposition to the proposed charter school.    Those criticisms\n\nquestioned the capacity and qualifications of Quest’s founders;\n\nthe potential negative impact on the quality of programs and\n\n                                 12\n\feducational offerings at Montclair public schools; a lack of\n\ncommunity support for, or interest in, a charter school and,\n\nconversely, strong community support for the public high school;\n\nand the lack of an adequate facility to house the proposed\n\ncharter school.\n\n    According to the Amplification, based on the entirety of\n\nthose considerations, the Commissioner had determined that\n\nQuest’s application did not have a high probability of success.\n\nShe therefore had denied the application.\n\n                                C.\n\n    On appeal before the Appellate Division, petitioner’s\n\ncriticisms focused on the Commissioner’s review procedures and\n\nthe specific information used by the Commissioner in her\n\nevaluation of the application, including the information\n\nprovided through Dr. Alvarez’s evaluation, the citizen letters,\n\nand the existing desegregation order that applied to the\n\nMontclair public schools.   In addition, petitioner contended\n\nthat the federal No Child Left Behind Act, 20 U.S.C.A. § 6316,\n\nrequired the Commissioner to approve charter school applications\n\nin districts, like Montclair, that had been identified as in\n\nneed of improvement.\n\n    In response, the Commissioner addressed the propriety of\n\nthe information that she had considered in connection with the\n\napplication, countered the argument that the No Child Left\n\n                                13\n\fBehind Act had applicability in this setting, and urged the\n\nAppellate Division to affirm her determination because the\n\nadministrative decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or\n\nunreasonable.\n\n    The Appellate Division affirmed the Commissioner’s denial\n\nin an unpublished decision.   The court noted that a deferential\n\nstandard of review applied to its review of the Commissioner’s\n\naction in this matter.

The panel held that, based on the record,\n\nthe Commissioner’s denial of Quest Academy’s application was not\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.   The court specifically\n\nrejected petitioner’s argument that the federal No Child Left\n\n                                14\n\fBehind Act, 20 U.S.C.A. § 6316, requires the Commissioner to\n\napprove charter school applications in districts identified as\n\nin need of improvement.

She further argues\n\nthat the Commissioner should be required to provide written\n\nreasons for a denial at the time the decision is made, and that\n\nan Amplification of Reasons given after a decision is appealed\n\nshould not be allowed.    Consistent with those criticisms,\n\npetitioner claims that due process was violated because the\n\ndecision, when issued, was not supported by substantial credible\n\nevidence.\n\n                                 15\n\f    The Commissioner argues that the Appellate Division\n\ncorrectly applied an arbitrary and capricious standard of\n\nreview.    She further argues that the panel appropriately\n\ndetermined that the Commissioner’s denial procedurally was\n\ncompliant with law and substantively was not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable.\n\n    More specifically, the Commissioner characterizes her\n\ndecision to deny a charter school application as quasi-\n\nlegislative, distinguishing it from quasi-judicial actions.      The\n\nCommissioner points out that the Act does not require the\n\nCommissioner to conduct a hearing and none is required by due\n\nprocess.   The Commissioner and the applicant do not have an\n\nadversarial relationship and the Commissioner is not required,\n\nin deciding whether to grant a charter school application, to\n\nweigh opposing parties’ evidence or make credibility\n\ndeterminations.   Therefore, the Commissioner maintains that this\n\nappeal does not involve review of quasi-judicial action.\n\nInstead, she relies on case law that states that quasi-\n\nlegislative decisions are reviewed under the arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable standard.   Further, the Commissioner\n\ncontends that, subsumed in that standard, are the requirements\n\nthat the Commissioner’s decision demonstrate a thorough review\n\nof the record and that the decision reached have sufficient\n\nsupport in the record to sustain it.    Both requirements, she\n\n                                 16\n\fcontends, are met here.   Further, in response to petitioner’s\n\nobjection to the Commissioner’s amplification of reasons for her\n\ndecision, the Commissioner cites Rule 2:5-1(b), which permits a\n\njudge, officer, or agency to file an amplification of a prior\n\ndecision if it is appealed, as authority for her action.\n\n                                III.\n\n                                 A.\n\n    Judicial review of administrative agency action is a matter\n\nof constitutional right in New Jersey.   See N.J. Const. art. VI,\n\n§ 5, ¶ 4 (allocating relief from agency actions to “the Superior\n\nCourt, on terms and in the manner provided by rules of the\n\nSupreme Court, as of right”).   Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) provides for\n\nreview of “final decisions or actions of any state\n\nadministrative agency or officer” in the Appellate Division of\n\nthe Superior Court.\n\n    Through N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(c), the Legislature has decreed\n\nthat the Commissioner is the final administrative decision-maker\n\non the grant or rejection of a charter school application.\n\nThus, an applicant has the right to appeal the Commissioner’s\n\nrejection of a charter school application pursuant to Rule 2:2-\n\n3(a)(2).   The Act also confers on an unsuccessful applicant a\n\nstatutory right to appeal.   See N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(d)\n\n(conferring statutory right to appeal to Appellate Division of\n\nSuperior Court on charter school applicant and local board of\n\n                                 17\n\feducation).\n\n     While the Act grants to a denied applicant a statutory\n\nright to appeal, it does not confer a right to an administrative\n\nhearing.   That has the consequence of denying a rejected\n\napplicant the ability to claim the right, under the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15, to\n\na quasi-judicial administrative hearing governed by APA\n\nstandards for a “contested case.”    See N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2\n\n(defining “contested case” as “a proceeding . . . in which the\n\nlegal rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits or other\n\nlegal relations of specific parties are required by\n\nconstitutional right or by statute to be determined by an agency\n\nby decisions, determinations, or orders, addressed to them or\n\ndisposing of their interests, after opportunity for an agency\n\nhearing”).3   However, that does not end all inquiry into the\n\nnature of the proceedings before the Commissioner when reviewing\n\nan application to operate a charter school.\n\n     The labels of “quasi-judicial” and “quasi-legislative”\n\ntypically are used to determine whether the agency is obligated\n\nto provide an administrative adjudicative hearing, regardless of\n\nwhether the matter would merit the designation of a “contested\n\ncase” under the APA.   See Cunningham v. Dep’t of Civil Serv., 69\n\n\n3\n  The applicant has not asserted a substantive constitutional\nright.\n                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1975) (using such labels in explaining when,\n\noutside of APA requirements, right to trial-like hearing exists\n\nas matter of fundamental fairness and administrative due\n\nprocess).   If the matter centers on the resolution of disputed\n\nadjudicative facts, if the parties are adverse, or if\n\ncredibility determinations must be made, more formal\n\nadjudicatory-type proceedings must be provided (hence the quasi-\n\njudicial designation).   See, e.g., High Horizons Dev. Co. v.\n\nN.J. Dep’t of Transp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1898483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1898483/high-horizons-dev-v-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49-51 (1990) (discussing\n\nwhen need arises for trial-like, adjudicatory process).

Id.\n\nat 52-53.\n\n    Such labels as quasi-adjudicative and quasi-legislative\n\nhave limits to their usefulness.     Indeed, this Court has\n\nrecognized that agencies must retain the ability to provide\n\nvarious informal, flexible procedures for determining certain\n\nissues or taking certain actions.     Ibid.   In all instances,\n\nfundamental due process requirements of notice and opportunity\n\nto be heard must be satisfied, even though the contours of their\n\nsatisfaction may vary.   See id. at 51-54 (reviewing property\n\nowner’s criticism of procedural fairness in Commissioner of\n\nTransportation’s handling of application for highway access\n\n                                19\n\fpermit).     As in the matter presently before this Court, High\n\nHorizons involved a due process challenge in a matter that did\n\nnot fit easily into classifications of whether an agency was\n\nacting in a judicial or “quasi-judicial” capacity, or in a\n\nlegislative or “quasi-legislative” capacity.      Id. at 50-51.\n\nImportantly, the labels do not result in a meaningful difference\n\nin the role played by judicial review of administrative\n\ndeterminations.    The “core value[] of judicial review of\n\nadministrative action is the furtherance of accountability.”\n\nId. at 53.\n\n                                  B.\n\n    Reflecting the need to respect agency action taken pursuant\n\nto authority delegated by the Legislature, the standard for\n\njudicial review of administrative agency action is limited:       An\n\nappellate court may reverse an agency decision if it is\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.      See In re Petition for\n\nRulemaking, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008585/matter-of-rulemaking-njac-10-82-12/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325 (1989).      In other words, a court\n\nmay intervene when “it is clear that the agency action is\n\ninconsistent with its mandate.”    Ibid.    Indeed, the test often\n\nis expressed in the negative.    See, e.g., Brady v.

(reversing board’s decision where findings were\n\nunsupported by record, based on “total disregard” of facts,\n\nagainst “overwhelming weight” of testimony, and based on record\n\n“skew[ed]” by administrative law judge), certif. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).     Plainly, the standard requires that the\n\nadministrative decision be supported by the underlying record,\n\nregardless of the manner in which due process requires that the\n\nrecord be created.    The obligation that there be substantial\n\nevidence in the record requires a sifting of the record, and the\n\nability to find support for the conclusions reached by the\n\nCommissioner under the statutory framework within which she must\n\nact.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n                                  A.\n\n       The statutory and regulatory scheme for the approval of\n\napplications to operate a charter school functions under tight\n\ntime frames as cycle after cycle of charter school applications\n\nare submitted seeking approval to open in the ensuing school\n\nyear.   N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1(b)(1).      The regulatory scheme operates\n\nunder the expectation that an application either will be\n\napproved through phases one and two of the review process and\n\nmove on for implementation in the upcoming school year, or will\n\nrequire retooling and resubmission.       N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1.   The\n\n                                  23\n\fDepartment, as noted in Quest’s denial letter, assists\n\napplicants with the application process by offering training\n\nprograms in how to prepare applications for review.\n\n       That said, the applications arrive in batches and must be\n\nreviewed and resolved in a timely fashion in order to proceed to\n\nimplementation in the next school year.     See ibid.   At oral\n\nargument, the Attorney General, arguing for the Commissioner,\n\nrepresented to the Court that the Commissioner is exceedingly\n\ncareful in the approval of charter schools because of the impact\n\nthat a wrong decision will have on students who attend a charter\n\nschool that falters, or worse, fails to provide an educational\n\nprogram that satisfies the constitutional standard of a thorough\n\nand efficient education.    See Englewood on the Palisades II,\n\nsupra, 164 N.J. at 323, 336 (stating obligation to provide\n\n“thorough and efficient system of education” and holding that\n\nCommissioner must assess economic impact of proposed charter\n\nschool on district of residence).     We are appreciative of the\n\nimportance that must be ascribed to the Commissioner’s approval\n\nof a charter school and that, nevertheless, such reviews must\n\nproceed expeditiously.\n\n       Turning to the merits of the Commissioner’s determination\n\nin respect of Quest Academy’s application, we find that the\n\nCommissioner’s decision was amply supported by the record before\n\nher.    We do not second guess the educational judgments expressed\n\n                                 24\n\fin the Amplification letter issued on behalf of the\n\nCommissioner, such as her findings that Quest Academy “failed to\n\npresent . . . a comprehensive and fully integrated educational\n\nprogram” and that “the strategies presented by Quest were\n\nneither connected to, nor supportive of, the proposed\n\neducational program.”    Moreover, as envisioned by the\n\nLegislature, that record properly included relevant submissions\n\nnecessary for proper consideration and allowance of a charter\n\nschool to operate.    Specifically, we refer to the analysis\n\nprovided by the local superintendent of schools, which is\n\nrequired to be submitted by N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(c) and N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:11-2.1(d).   In addition, in Englewood on the Palisades II,\n\nsupra, we stated that the Commissioner was obliged to consider\n\nwhether an impacted local school district had demonstrated “with\n\nsome specificity that the constitutional requirements of a\n\nthorough and efficient education would be jeopardized by [the\n\ndistrict’s] loss” of the funds to be allocated to a charter\n\nschool, and that the Commissioner was “obligated to evaluate\n\ncarefully the impact that loss of funds would have on the\n\nability of the district of residence to deliver a thorough and\n\nefficient education” when considering whether or not to approve\n\nthe charter school.     164 N.J. at 334-35.   The information in Dr.\n\nAlvarez’s submission was appropriately part of the\n\nCommissioner’s determination.    We add that Quest Academy was\n\n                                  25\n\fentitled to respond to it by way of argument, at the least,\n\nwithin the tight time frames permitted in the review process,\n\nand through any subsequent resubmission of the application.\n\n    In addition, petitioner’s objection to the Commissioner’s\n\nreliance on the existing desegregation order as a factor to\n\nconsider in rejecting the application lacks merit.    Again, in\n\nEnglewood on the Palisades II, supra, we stated that “the\n\nCommissioner must assess the racial impact that a charter school\n\napplicant will have on the district of residence in which the\n\ncharter school will operate” and “must use the full panoply of\n\n[her] powers to avoid” segregation resulting from the grant of a\n\ncharter school application.   164 N.J. at 329.\n\n    Finally, we see no error in the Commissioner’s\n\nconsideration of unsolicited letters from local citizens or her\n\nreliance on her own expertise in assessing overall viability of\n\nthis proposed charter school.   In making predictive or\n\njudgmental determinations, case law has recognized the value\n\nthat administrative expertise can play in the rendering of a\n\nsound administrative determination.   Judicial deference is at a\n\nhigh when reviewing such findings.    See, e.g., Golden Nugget\n\nAtl. City Corp. v. Atl. City Elec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J. Super.</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n122-23 (App. Div. 1988).\n\n    The Commissioner’s decision -- but only as it was amplified\n\n-- demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough weighing and judgment\n\n                                26\n\fof the merits of the Quest Academy application.    There is no\n\nright to operate a charter school.    There is only the\n\nopportunity to apply for approval to operate one if the\n\napplication demonstrates proper merit.    The burden is on the\n\napplicant to show that it can meet the requirements for\n\nobtaining permission to educate public school children in a\n\ncharter school setting.    The Commissioner’s review and rejection\n\nof this application is sustainable on the record she had before\n\nher.    There is no basis for judicial intervention.\n\n                                 B.\n\n       We add only a brief comment about the Commissioner’s\n\namplification.   Rule 2:5-1(b) expressly permits its filing after\n\na notice of appeal has been filed.    Indeed, the Rule anticipates\n\nthat amplification may occur after an appeal has been filed.      To\n\nthe extent that there are time frames for its submission set\n\nforth in the Court Rule, we note that no objection was raised on\n\nthe basis of the Rule’s time frames for such submissions, which\n\nare designed to prevent delay in the processing of appeals.\n\n       We add that we accept the Commissioner’s explanation for\n\nher manner of responding to applicants.    Although the letter of\n\ndenial did not detail the deficiencies found in the application,\n\nit offered instead a face-to-face meeting to review in detail\n\nthe shortcomings in the application that Quest Academy\n\nsubmitted.    According to the Commissioner, the large number of\n\n                                 27\n\fapplicants (forty-five) who were reviewed in the batch with\n\nQuest Academy rendered lengthy written responses difficult and\n\ntaxing of precious departmental resources.   While it would be\n\nnaturally preferable from the applicant’s perspective to receive\n\ninitially more than a generic form letter denying an\n\napplication, here Quest Academy received a bit more than that.\n\nSome information about the application’s shortcomings was\n\nprovided in the denial letter, and the subsequent amplification\n\nfully detailed those issues.   In reviewing as complex a proposal\n\nas that required for a newly proposed charter school, there is a\n\nbenefit to offering a discussion, instead of a written\n\ncataloguing, of mistakes or deficiencies in the application that\n\nhas been rejected.   We do not fault the Commissioner for\n\nchoosing a dialogue involving constructive criticism as her\n\npreferred approach for producing approvable applications when\n\nresubmitted.\n\n                                V.\n\n    The judgment of the Appellate Division, affirming the\n\nCommissioner of Education’s denial of the charter school\n\napplication of Quest Academy, is affirmed.\n\n     CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER, and JUSTICES ALBIN and PATTERSON, and\nJUDGES RODRÍGUEZ and CUFF (both temporarily assigned) join in\nJUSTICE LaVECCHIA’s opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                28\n\f             SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\n\nNO.
