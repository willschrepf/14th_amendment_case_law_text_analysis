          "plain_text": "                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n\n\nAYANNA BLUE,\n       Plaintiff,\n\n               v.                                         Civil Action No. 10-1504 (JEB)\n\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al.,\n       Defendants.\n\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiff Ayanna Blue was an 18-year-old student at the Transition Academy at Shadd, a\n\nschool within the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) for emotionally disturbed\n\nstudents, when she became involved in a sexual relationship with her teacher, Robert Weismiller.\n\nThat relationship forms the basis of Plaintiff’s current suit, in which she brings myriad federal\n\nand state causes of action against Weismiller as well as the District of Columbia, DCPS, and\n\nformer DCPS Chancellor Michelle Rhee. The last three, collectively referred to as the “District\n\nDefendants,” have now filed a Motion to Dismiss. As Plaintiff’s federal claims are all legally\n\ndeficient, and as her state-law claims are barred by her failure to provide timely notice to the\n\nDistrict, the Court will grant the Motion. The case may proceed against Weismiller alone.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that while she was a student in his\n\nclass, Weismiller, then a DCPS teacher, initiated and engaged in a sexual relationship with her\n\nfrom November 2008 to April 2009. Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 19-20. During this time, Plaintiff\n\nbecame pregnant and in late 2009 gave birth to Weismiller’s daughter. Id., ¶ 21. In May 2009,\n\n\n                                                 1\n \n\fDCPS officials learned of Plaintiff’s pregnancy and conducted an investigation into her\n\nrelationship with Weismiller. Id., ¶ 29. Weismiller denied having had a sexual relationship with\n\nPlaintiff, and while other DCPS teachers and staff members reported frequently seeing Plaintiff\n\nand Weismiller alone in his classroom, sometimes with the lights off, no one reported observing\n\nany inappropriate physical contact between them. See id., ¶¶ 30-36. Following this\n\ninvestigation, DCPS concluded that there was no “definitive proof” Weismiller had engaged in\n\nany wrongdoing. Id., ¶¶ 38-39. He was nevertheless fired the following October as part of a\n\nsystem-wide reduction in force. Id., ¶ 14.\n\n       Plaintiff also alleges that she was not the first student with whom Weismiller initiated a\n\nsexual relationship. Beginning in 1976, she pleads, while teaching high school in Prince\n\nGeorge’s County, Maryland, Weismiller initiated sexual relationships with two of his students.\n\nId., ¶ 24. In 1984, while teaching middle school in Prince William County, Virginia, Plaintiff\n\nalleges Weismiller sexually assaulted two eighth grade students, which resulted in a lawsuit\n\nagainst him and the school board and his subsequent termination. Id., ¶ 26. Prior to hiring\n\nWeismiller, Plaintiff asserts, Defendants in the present case “knew or should have known that\n\nWeismiller had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with students in the past.” Id., ¶\n\n61. With respect to the Transition Academy at Shadd, Plaintiff alleges that it is “a failure, where\n\nstudents are inadequately supervised and subject to injury.” Id., ¶ 46.\n\n       On September 7, 2010, Plaintiff brought this action against the District of Columbia,\n\nDCPS, and Rhee, in her capacity as former Chancellor of DCPS, and against Weismiller,\n\nalleging negligent supervision, negligent hiring and retention, and a violation of 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1681 et seq. against the District Defendants, and intentional infliction of emotional distress,\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty, and a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against all Defendants. Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n \n\ffiled her Amended Complaint on September 21, 2010, and her Second Amended Complaint on\n\nMay 11, 2011. Now before the Court is the District Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss; Defendant\n\nWeismiller has not moved to dismiss the claims against him. For the reasons set forth below, the\n\nCourt will grant the District Defendants’ Motion.\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a\n\ncomplaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” In evaluating Defendants’\n\nMotion to Dismiss, the Court must “treat the complaint’s factual allegations as true . . . and must\n\ngrant plaintiff ‘the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Sparrow\n\nv. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d 1111, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Schuler v. United\n\nStates, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C. Cir. 1979)) (internal citation omitted); see also Jerome Stevens\n\nPharms., Inc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The notice pleading rules are “not\n\nmeant to impose a great burden on a plaintiff,” Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 347\n\n(2005), and she must thus be given every favorable inference that may be drawn from the\n\nallegations of fact. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 584 (2007).\n\n       Although “detailed factual allegations” are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion, id. at 555, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state\n\na claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009)\n\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Plaintiff must put forth “factual content that allows the\n\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”\n\nId. The Court need not accept as true “a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,” nor an\n\ninference unsupported by the facts set forth in the Complaint. Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm’n,\n\n456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n \n\f(internal quotation marks omitted)). Though a plaintiff may survive a 12(b)(6) motion even if\n\n“recovery is very remote and unlikely,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Scheuer v. Rhodes,\n\n416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)), the facts alleged in the complaint “must be enough to raise a right to\n\nrelief above the speculative level.” Id.\n\nIII.    Analysis\n\n        The District Defendants first contend that Plaintiff improperly names DCPS and former\n\nChancellor Rhee as defendants in this action. Next they challenge Plaintiff’s federal claims\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 20 U.S.C. § 1681 on the ground that she has failed to sufficiently\n\nplead the required elements. Finally, they maintain that Plaintiff’s state-common-law claims\n\nmust be dismissed because she failed to comply with the notice requirements of D.C. Code § 12-\n\n309. The Court will address each of these arguments in turn.\n\n        A.     DCPS and Chancellor Rhee\n\n               1.      DCPS\n\n        The District Defendants first move to dismiss DCPS as a defendant in this suit on the\n\nground that “DCPS is a subordinate governmental agency within the District of Columbia\n\ngovernment and as a result is non sui juris.” Mot. at 5 (citing Hinson ex rel. N.H. v. Merritt\n\nEducational Center, 521 F. Supp. 2d 22, 34 (D.C. 2007)). Plaintiff responds that DCPS is a\n\nproper defendant in cases alleging municipal liability under Monell v. Department of Social\n\nServices of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). See Opp. at 27-28. Plaintiff cites Monell\n\nfor the proposition that “school entities, such as a school board or school system, are ‘persons’\n\nsubject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Id. at 28 (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 690, 697-99).\n\nThis is the sole authority she cites in support of her position that DCPS is a proper party to this\n\nsuit.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n \n\f       Courts in this District have held on numerous recent occasions that DCPS is non sui juris\n\n– that is, non-suable as an entity separate from the District of Columbia. See, e.g., U.S. ex rel.\n\nDavis v. District of Columbia, 591 F. Supp. 2d 30, 40 (D.D.C. 2008) (DCPS may not be sued as\n\nseparate entity); Hinson, 521 F. Supp. 2d at 34 (“a number of courts addressing this very issue\n\nhave concluded that DCPS is not a suable entity under the D.C.Code”) (collecting cases);\n\nBowers v. Janey, 468 F. Supp. 2d 102, 105 n.3 (D.D.C. 2006) (“case law has indicated that the\n\nDCPS ‘is not a suable entity’”).\n\n       In another case from this District, Winder v. Erste, No. 03-2623, 2005 WL 736639\n\n(D.D.C., Mar. 31, 2005), Judge John Bates considered and rejected an argument similar to the\n\nargument Plaintiff makes here – to wit, that Monell “stands for the broad proposition that school\n\nsystems are directly subject to liability as ‘persons’ under § 1983.” Id. at *3. Judge Bates\n\nclarified that the Supreme Court’s decision in Monell\n\n           does not indicate that municipal liability must attach to school boards\n           directly, where another municipal entity is the entity legally responsible\n           for the school board's liabilities. Thus, where, as here, municipal liability\n           may attach simply by suing the proper municipal defendant -- the District\n           of Columbia or one of its officials, as opposed to DCPS -- Monell does not\n           mandate that § 1983 actions must lie against school boards.\n\nId. at *4. He thus concluded: “Because DCPS is not a suable entity under the D.C. Code, and\n\nfederal law does not require DCPS to be the named municipal defendant, the Court grants\n\nDCPS’s motion to dismiss.” Id.\n\n       As this Court concurs with these decisions, all of Plaintiff’s claims against DCPS must be\n\ndismissed. See Hobby v. District of Columbia, No. 07-1061, 2007 WL 4233627, at *1 n.1\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 29, 2007) (“Because bodies within the District of Columbia government are not\n\nsuable as separate entities . . . DCPS is dismissed from this case.”) (internal citations omitted).\n\nThe proper party against whom Plaintiff must bring her claims is the District of Columbia itself.\n\n\n                                                  5\n \n\fSee Winder, 2005 WL 736639, at *4 (“the proper municipal defendant [is] the District of\n\nColumbia . . . as opposed to DCPS”); Bowers, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 105 n.3 (“The employer in this\n\nsituation would be the District of Columbia rather than the DCPS, as case law has indicated that\n\nDCPS ‘is not a suable entity.’”).\n\n                2.      Chancellor Rhee\n\n        The Court also grants the District Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claims\n\nagainst Michelle Rhee in her official capacity as former Chancellor of DCPS. “A section 1983\n\nsuit for damages against municipal officials in their official capacities is . . . equivalent to a suit\n\nagainst the municipality itself.” Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d 418, 424 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996). “‘Based upon the understanding that it is duplicative to name both a government entity\n\nand the entity’s employees in their official capacity[,]’ courts routinely dismiss claims against the\n\nofficials to conserve judicial resources when the entity itself is also sued.” Trimble v. District of\n\nColumbia, 779 F. Supp. 2d 54, 58 n.3 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Robinson v. District of Columbia,\n\n403 F. Supp. 2d 39, 49 (D.D.C. 2005)). While naming Chancellor Rhee as a defendant may thus\n\nnot be legally improper, see DL v. District of Columbia, 450 F. Supp. 2d 21, 24 (D.D.C. 2006),\n\nthe Court will dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against her as redundant.\n\n        The Court now considers whether Plaintiff’s Second Amendment Complaint successfully\n\nstates claims against the District of Columbia.\n\n        B.      Federal Claims\n\n        Plaintiff asserts causes of action against the District of Columbia under two federal\n\nstatutes, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (Title IX). As this Court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction derives from these federal claims, the Court will address them first. See Sec. Am.\n\nCompl., ¶ 10 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1367(a)).\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n \n\f               1.      42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n       Section 1983 provides for a cause of action against\n\n           [e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,\n           custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,\n           subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or\n           other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,\n           privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to allege\n\n1) “the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and the laws of the United States” and 2)\n\n“that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.” West\n\nv. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). A municipality, including the District of Columbia, may be\n\nsued as a person under § 1983. Monell, 436 U.S. at 690; see also Dorman v. District of\n\nColumbia, 888 F.2d 159, 162 (D.C. Cir. 1989).\n\n       Section 1983, however, only imposes liability on a municipality for its own illegal\n\nactions – i.e., “‘action [taken] pursuant to official municipal policy’” – that “‘subjects’ a person\n\nto a deprivation of rights or ‘causes’ a person ‘to be subjected’ to such a deprivation.” Connick\n\nv. Thompson, 131 S. Ct. 1350, 1359 (2011) (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 691-92); see also\n\nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480 (1986) (“recovery from a municipality is\n\nlimited to acts that are, properly speaking, acts ‘of the municipality’ – that is, acts which the\n\nmunicipality has officially sanctioned or ordered”). “Official municipal policy includes the\n\ndecisions of a government’s lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so\n\npersistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359.\n\nA municipality may not, however, be held liable under § 1983 on a theory of respondeat\n\nsuperior or vicarious liability for the acts of its employees. Monell, 436 U.S. at 691-92.\n\n       Municipal liability under Monell also requires a showing of causation – specifically, a §\n\n1983 plaintiff must plead facts to support an inference that some official government policy or\n                                                  7\n \n\fcustom “‘cause[d]’ an employee to violate another’s constitutional rights.” Monell, 475 U.S. at\n\n692 (citing Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 370-71 (1976)). In other words, “a municipality can\n\nbe liable under § 1983 only where its policies [or customs] are the ‘moving force [behind] the\n\nconstitutional violation.’” City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388-389 (1989)\n\n(quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 694; Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 326 (1981)). The D.C.\n\nCircuit has described the inquiry as:\n\n           whether [Plaintiff] sufficiently alleged that a District custom or policy\n           caused the claimed violations of his constitutional rights. Causation\n           would exist if, for instance, the municipality or one of its policymakers\n           explicitly adopted the policy that was “the moving force of the\n           constitutional violation.” . . . Or a policymaker could knowingly ignore a\n           practice that was consistent enough to constitute custom. . . . Or the\n           municipality may not have responded ‘to a need . . . in such a manner as to\n           show “deliberate indifference’ to the risk that not addressing the need will\n           result in constitutional violations.”\n\nWarren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that the District is liable under § 1983 for three separate violations of her\n\nconstitutional rights – her substantive due process right to bodily integrity and her right to equal\n\nprotection of the laws based on both her gender and her status as an emotionally disturbed\n\nstudent. While Plaintiff pleads all three violations in Count V of her Second Amended\n\nComplaint, they require separate analyses.\n\n                       a. Substantive Due Process\n\n       Plaintiff first contends that the District’s “decisions, customs, policies or practices have\n\nviolated [her] rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to be free from\n\nconduct that violates her bodily integrity.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 87. While neither the Supreme\n\nCourt nor the D.C. Circuit has ruled on whether the right to bodily integrity includes the right to\n\nbe free from sexual abuse, courts in several Circuits have sustained substantive due process\n                                                  8\n \n\fclaims arising from a primary or secondary student’s sexual relationship with a teacher. See,\n\ne.g., Stoneking v. Bradford Area School District, 882 F.2d 720, 727 (3d Cir. 1989); Doe v.\n\nTaylor Independent School District, 15 F.3d 443, 451-52 (5th Cir.1994); Kinman v. Omaha\n\nPublic School District 171 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir. 1999).\n\n       This case differs from those cited above in that Plaintiff here was already 18 years old\n\nwhen her sexual relationship with Weismiller began; in other words, she was no longer a minor.\n\nSec. Am. Compl., ¶ 13. The Court is aware of only one case in which a court squarely addressed\n\nthe question of whether an 18-year-old high school student could state such a claim. See Henry\n\nv. Toups, No. 08-939, 2010 WL 3398857 (E.D. La. Aug. 23, 2010). In that case, Toups, a high\n\nschool band teacher, was sued by two of his students with whom he had engaged in sexual\n\nrelations, including Henry, who was already 18 at the time. Id. at *1. Toups argued that his\n\nrelationship with Henry amounted to consensual sex between adults and therefore could not be\n\nthe basis for a constitutional tort. Id. at *2. Citing Doe v. Taylor Independent School District,\n\n15 F.3d 443, the court found that the “Fifth Circuit does not distinguish between the age of\n\nschool children”: “Jane Doe's substantive due process claims are grounded upon the premise that\n\nschool children – [it] doesn’t say school children who are under 18 – school children have a\n\nliberty interest in their bodily integrity that is protected by the due process laws of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, and upon the premise that physical abuse by a school employee violates that right.”\n\nId. at *7. Conversely, in Douglas v. Brookville Area School District, No. 10-1087, 2011 WL\n\n6116449 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 8, 2011), the court questioned whether the “seemingly consensual\n\nnature” of a relationship between a fifteen-year-old student and a teacher at her high school\n\nshould weigh against a finding that the teacher’s actions were conscience-shocking and a\n\nviolation of the student’s right to bodily integrity, writing, “[T]he Court is ‘reluctant to expand\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n \n\fthe concept of substantive due process’ beyond the context of coercive activities without the\n\nbenefit of adequate briefing from the parties.” Id. at *15.\n\n          Although this is an interesting question, the Court need not resolve it; indeed, the District\n\nhas chosen not even to pursue this line of argument. As the District has not raised such a\n\nchallenge, and in the absence of clear authority, the Court will assume without deciding that\n\nPlaintiff can allege a substantive due process violation relating to bodily integrity against\n\nWeismiller and, to the extent the violation was caused by a policy or custom of DCPS, against\n\nthe District. The Court thus turns to whether Plaintiff has adequately alleged municipal liability\n\nin connection with such a violation.\n\n          Plaintiff argues that she has adequately pled three District decisions, customs, policies, or\n\npractices that support her claim that the District is liable for Weismiller’s violation of her bodily\n\nintegrity: 1) “failing to investigate Weismiller’s background before hiring him,” 2) “cultivating\n\nan atmosphere where teachers are afraid to report abuse,” and 3) “failing to terminate Weismiller\n\nfor cause after learning of his misconduct.” Opp. at 15; see Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 82-84, 86-87.\n\n                                i.       Failure to investigate background\n\n          Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support her claim that the District has a\n\n“custom, policy or practice of failing to adequately investigate the backgrounds of its teachers\n\nbefore hiring them” that caused her to suffer a violation of her right to bodily integrity. Sec. Am.\n\nCompl., ¶¶ 82, 87. All that she has alleged is that, since 1976, Weismiller has been involved in\n\n“inappropriate sexual relationships with at least four other students at other schools in the\n\nWashington, D.C. area,” and that the District, DCPS, and Rhee “knew or should have known that\n\nWeismiller had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with students in the past.” Id., ¶¶\n\n23, 61.\n\n\n\n                                                    10\n \n\f       Courts that have considered the elements of a § 1983 claim alleging liability arising from\n\na municipality’s hiring policies or practices have concluded that, “[i]n order to prove that a\n\nmunicipal hiring or training policy violated his rights under § 1983, [a plaintiff] must show that\n\n(1) the training or hiring procedures of the municipality's policymaker were inadequate; (2) the\n\nmunicipality's policymaker was deliberately indifferent in adopting the hiring or training policy;\n\nand (3) the inadequate hiring or training policy directly caused the plaintiff's injury.” Benavides\n\nv. County of Wilson, 955 F.2d 968, 972 (5th Cir. 1992) (citing City of Canton v. Harris, 489\n\nU.S. 378, 388-92 (1989)); see also Andrews v. Fowler, 98 F.3d 1069, 1076 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\nPlaintiff here must thus plead the existence of a DCPS policy or custom of inadequately\n\nchecking the backgrounds of teachers before hiring them.\n\n       She has not done so. Plaintiff does not identify any official District policy on pre-hiring\n\nbackground checks of DCPS teachers or allege how a District policymaker was deliberately\n\nindifferent in adopting such a policy. Opp. at 14-15. Other than Weismiller’s, she does not even\n\npoint to any other background checks that she alleges were performed inadequately that could\n\nestablish a custom “so widespread as to have the force of law.” Board of the County\n\nCommissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403-04 (1997). Realizing that she has\n\nnot identified any actual District policy or practice, Plaintiff falls back on the argument that “[i]t\n\nis well-established that a plaintiff can state a valid municipal liability claim by alleging a\n\ndecision by a municipality to hire an employee without adequately investigating that employee’s\n\nbackground.” Opp. at 15 (citing Brown, 520 U.S. at 412). In other words, Plaintiff grounds her\n\nclaim on the single hiring of Weismiller. Plaintiff’s reading of Brown, however, overstates the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in that case. Far from recognizing such a well-established claim, the\n\nCourt in Brown merely considered how a plaintiff might plead such a claim without causing\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n \n\fmunicipal liability based on policy or custom to collapse into respondeat superior liability.\n\nBrown, 520 U.S. at 412. The Court “assum[ed] without deciding that proof of a single instance\n\nof inadequate screening could . . . trigger municipal liability,” but found the evidence before it\n\ninsufficient to sustain such a claim. Id.\n\n       Underlying the Supreme Court’s analysis in Brown, however, was the County’s\n\nstipulation that Sheriff Moore, who made the hiring decision in question, was a final municipal\n\npolicymaker. Id. at 397. This concession provided the key to unlocking the plaintiff’s potential\n\nmunicipal-liability claims. The Supreme Court has held that “municipal liability may be\n\nimposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.”\n\nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480 (1986). The standard for such a claim,\n\nhowever, is stringent. In such a case, “municipal liability under § 1983 attaches where – and\n\nonly where – a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various\n\nalternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the\n\nsubject matter in question.” Id. at 483. Limiting the single decisions that trigger municipal\n\nliability to those made by final policymakers is necessary to prevent the liability described by\n\nMonell and its progeny from being transformed into respondeat superior liability. It is thus\n\nnecessary in such cases to distinguish between “an exercise of policymaking authority and an\n\nexercise of delegated discretionary policy-implementing authority.” Brown, 520 U.S. at 434\n\n(emphasis in original); see also Triplett v. District of Columbia, 108 F.3d 1450, 1453 (“The only\n\nacts that count (though they may include inaction giving rise to or endorsing a custom) are ones\n\nby a person or persons who have ‘final policymaking authority [under] state law.’”) (quoting Jett\n\nv. Dallas Independent School District, 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n \n\f       Even if this Court were to read Brown and Pembaur broadly, however, Plaintiff has not\n\nalleged here that the decision to hire Weismiller without an adequate background check was\n\nmade by a final municipal policymaker and could therefore be properly attributable to the\n\nDistrict. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 82 (District has “a custom, policy or practice of failing to\n\nadequately investigate the backgrounds of its teachers before hiring them”); cf. id., ¶ 86 (“the\n\ndecision not to terminate Weismiller after DCPS investigated his sexual relationship with\n\nPlaintiff was made by a final municipal decisionmaker and is properly attributable to” the\n\nDistrict) (emphasis added); cf. also Singletary v. District of Columbia, 685 F. Supp. 2d 81, 90\n\n(D.D.C. 2010) (“[s]ignificantly, the District does not dispute that the [Parole] Board was the final\n\npolicymaker regarding parole revocation nor does it challenge the sufficiency of Singletary’s\n\nallegation on that point”) (emphasis in original). For this reason, she has failed to state a claim\n\nfor municipal liability based on a policy manifested through a final policymaker’s single hiring\n\ndecision.\n\n                             ii.       Teachers afraid to report abuse\n\n       Plaintiff’s second argument on substantive due process is similarly unavailing. She does\n\nnot plead a single fact in support of her claim that the District has a custom of “cultivating an\n\natmosphere where teachers are afraid to report abuse,” making this allegation solely “upon\n\ninformation and belief.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 84. While “detailed factual allegations” are not\n\nnecessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, Plaintiff must put\n\nforth “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is\n\nliable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation omitted); see also\n\nAtchinson v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d 418, 422-423, (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“a section 1983\n\ncomplaint alleging municipal liability must include some factual basis for the allegation of a\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n \n\fmunicipal policy or custom”). Without any factual support for her claims that DCPS teachers are\n\nafraid to report abuse in schools, that DCPS officials cultivated an atmosphere that created such a\n\nfear, or that this fear led to underreporting of abuse on other occasions, the Court cannot\n\nreasonably infer that any misconduct in the present case was the result of such a District custom,\n\npolicy, or practice.\n\n                            iii.      Failure to terminate Weismiller\n\n        Plaintiff’s final argument, based on DCPS’s failure to terminate Weismiller in light of the\n\nevents underlying her claims, also comes up short. Here she concededly does allege that “the\n\ndecision not to terminate Weismiller after DCPS investigated his sexual relationship with\n\nPlaintiff was made by a final municipal decisionmaker and is properly attributable to the\n\nDistrict.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 86. Plaintiff, however, has not pled the identity of the District\n\nofficial who made the decision not to terminate Weismiller and argues that she need not do so to\n\nwithstand Defendants’ Motion. In any event, whether a particular District official has “final\n\npolicymaking authority is a question of state law.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483. A particular\n\nofficial “may have discretion to hire and fire employees without also being the [District] official\n\nresponsible for establishing county employment policy,” and “[t]he fact that a particular official\n\n– even a policymaking official – has discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not,\n\nwithout more, give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion.” Id. at 481-\n\n82, 484 n.12. The Court need not decide, however, whether Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that\n\na final policymaker is responsible for the decision not to fire Weismiller because her claim here\n\nfails on another ground: she has not pled causation.\n\n        Even if the decision to retain Weismiller following the investigation into his relationship\n\nwith Plaintiff was made or ratified by a final District policymaker, it must also be “the moving\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n \n\fforce behind the injury of which [she] complains” in order to subject the District to § 1983\n\nliability. Brown, 520 U.S. at 405; see also Gonzales v. Ysleta Independent School District, 996\n\nF.2d 745, 762 n.13 (5th Cir. 1993) (“The district court also should have instructed the jury that\n\nthe school district could be held liable if its policies were ‘the “moving force [behind] the\n\nconstitutional violation.”’”) (quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 389-90); Singletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n90. The facts Plaintiff pleads in her Second Amended Complaint belie such an inference. She\n\nconcedes that her relationship with Weismiller concluded in April 2009. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶\n\n20. Yet, DCPS did not investigate Weismiller’s relationship with Plaintiff until May 2009 and\n\nonly thereafter made the decision not to terminate him. Id., ¶¶ 29, 38-39. As Plaintiff’s alleged\n\nharm in this case is her sexual relationship with Weismiller, a District decision made only after\n\nthat harm occurred cannot be said to be the “moving force” behind her injury.\n\n        Cases in which plaintiffs have sought to impose municipal liability on a school district for\n\nfailing to take disciplinary action against a teacher following allegations of sexual abuse or\n\nharassment have arisen in cases involving two such incidents, in which the plaintiffs point to the\n\nschool district’s improper response to a prior allegation of abuse as a policy that caused their\n\nsubsequent injury. See Gonzales, 996 F.2d at 746 (parents of student molested by her first-grade\n\nteacher alleged § 1983 claim based on school board’s decision to keep teacher in classroom\n\nfollowing similar allegations of sexual abuse two years earlier); Riddick v. School Board of City\n\nof Portsmouth, 238 F.3d 518, 522, 524 (4th Cir. 2000).\n\n        To the extent Plaintiff suggests that the decision not to fire Weismiller following the\n\nDistrict’s investigation into his relationship with her is itself indicative of a wider District policy\n\nof condoning sexual relationships between students and teachers that injured her here, such\n\ngeneral allegations, without more, will not sustain Plaintiff’s claim against the District. Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n \n\fcontends that cases like Henry v. County of Shasta, 132 F.3d 512 (9th Cir. 1997), stand for the\n\nproposition that “the failure to reprimand an employee can constitute a municipal policy of\n\ndeliberate indifference to constitutional violations.” Opp. at 19 (citing Henry, 132 F.3d at 519).\n\nAnother court in the Ninth Circuit has since clarified, however, that while Henry indicates that\n\nsuch post hoc evidence of a final policymaker’s response to a constitutional violation committed\n\nby a municipal employee is admissible as probative of governmental policy, such evidence is\n\n“one leg of a broader analysis. In Henry, the plaintiff did not just present evidence of post-event\n\ndeliberate indifference. He also presented several declarations of others’ similar experiences;\n\nsignificant evidence of bad intent by the state actors who violated his rights; and continued\n\nthreats throughout his ordeal.” Mejia v. City of Sacramento, 177 Fed. Appx. 661, 665 (9th Cir.\n\n2006). This was also the case in Fundiller v. City of Cooper City, 777 F.2d 1436 (11th Cir.\n\n1985), where the plaintiff’s complaint alleged that the city had “adopted a custom by acting with\n\ngross indifference to the conduct engaged in by its police officers, including repeated failures to\n\nfollow police procedure, unnecessary use of excessive force, roughness and shootings at the time\n\nof making arrests, intimidation during arrests and booking procedures, and drug trafficking.” Id.\n\nat 1442. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that “a persistent failure to take disciplinary action\n\nagainst officers can give rise to the inference that a municipality has ratified conduct, thereby\n\nestablishing a ‘custom’ within the meaning of Monell.” Id. at 1443 (emphasis added). If\n\nPlaintiff here bases her claim on a single decision by a final policymaker after her injury, these\n\ncases offer no support.\n\n       She has, therefore, failed to adequately plead the existence of a District policy or custom\n\nthat caused a violation of her substantive due process right to bodily integrity.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n \n\f                                            b. Equal Protection\n\n              Plaintiff next alleges that she has been denied equal protection of the law under the Fifth\n\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause, based either on her gender or her status as an emotionally\n\ndisturbed student.1 With respect to gender discrimination, Plaintiff alleges that by engaging in a\n\nsexual relationship with her, Weismiller “violated Plaintiff’s right . . . to be free from\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of her sex,” and that the District’s “customs, policies and practices\n\nalso have violated Plaintiff’s rights . . . to be free from discrimination on the basis of her sex.”\n\nSec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 92, 88. Plaintiff’s Opposition makes clear that this claim is also based a\n\ntheory of municipal liability as articulated by Monell and its progeny. See Opp. at 22-23.\n\nPlaintiff argues that her allegations that “the District has a custom of responding inappropriately\n\nto allegations of sexual misconduct, and a custom of cultivating an atmosphere where teachers\n\nare afraid to report abuse” support this claim. Id. at 23 (citing Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 83-84). She\n\nfurther argues that she “knows that the District responded inadequately after becoming aware of\n\nher sexual abuse, and she alleges that other females encountered identical problems.” Opp. at\n\n23. Finally, Plaintiff cites the District’s decision to “acquit[] Weismiller of any misconduct” and\n\nChancellor Rhee’s description of the results of the investigation as a “he said, she said” as\n\nevidence of intentional misconduct on the part of the District. Id. at 22 (citing Sec. Am. Compl.,\n\n¶¶ 38, 39, 83).\n\n              These allegations are insufficient to state a claim of municipal liability on the part of the\n\nDistrict. First, as noted above, Plaintiff pleads no facts in support of her claim that the District\n\n                                                            \n              1\n          Plaintiff actually pleads her claims under the “Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment,” see Sec.\nAm. Compl., ¶¶ 88-89, which does not exist. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause of the\nFifth Amendment, however, to encompass the rights explicitly contained in the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954) (applying Equal Protection Clause to D.C.\nthrough Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause in school segregation case); see also Dixon v. District of Columbia,\nNo. 10-7178, 2011 WL 6368195 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 20, 2011).\n\n                                                                  17\n \n\fhas a custom of “cultivating an atmosphere where teachers are afraid to report abuse.” See\n\nSection III.B.1.a.ii, supra. While Plaintiff argues that “other females [have] encountered\n\nidentical problems” with “the District responding inadequately after becoming aware of . . .\n\nsexual abuse,” she does so for the first time in her Opposition to this Motion. Opp. at 23. This\n\nallegation, let alone facts to support it, appear nowhere in her Second Amended Complaint and\n\nthus cannot form a basis for her claim. See Henthorne v. Dep’t of the Navy, 29 F.3d 682, 688-89\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n        The only evidence Plaintiff offers in support of her contention that the District has “a\n\ncustom, policy or practice of responding inappropriately to allegations of sexual misconduct that\n\ninjures female students” relates to the District’s handing of Plaintiff’s own sexual relationship\n\nwith Weismiller. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 83. Yet Plaintiff points to no official District policy as\n\nthe alleged cause of this inappropriate response, and to the extent she bases her claim on the\n\nexistence of such a DCPS or District custom, she has failed to show more than one occurrence of\n\nthe practice, let alone a custom “so widespread as to have the force of law.” Brown, 520 U.S. at\n\n403-04; see also Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d 418, 421 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“‘[p]roof\n\nof a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not sufficient to impose liability under Monell’\n\nabsent proof that the activity was caused by a municipal policy”) (quoting City of Oklahoma\n\nCity v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823-24 (1985)). Finally, if Plaintiff bases her claim on the\n\nDistrict’s decision “to acquit[] Weismiller of any misconduct,” as explained in Section\n\nIII.B.1.a.iii, supra, the evidence she pleads is insufficient.\n\n        The second equal-protection violation Plaintiff alleges is based on her status as an\n\nemotionally disturbed student. She has pled that the District has “a custom, policy or practice of\n\ninappropriately handing special education students, as demonstrated by the many failures at\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n \n\fShadd, including fighting in the hallways and numerous statements by DCPS officials that the\n\nschool is a disaster and should be closed.” See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 85. The District’s customs,\n\npolicies or practices, Plaintiff alleges, “have further violated Plaintiff’s rights . . . in that Plaintiff,\n\nas an emotionally disturbed student, has been treated differently by the District of Columbia and\n\nDCPS than other special education students. Specifically, Plaintiff has been placed at Shadd,\n\nwhich suffers from inadequate staffing and supervision, while other special education students\n\nhave remained at other schools.” Id., ¶ 89.\n\n        Plaintiff does not plead a corresponding predicate constitutional violation against\n\nWeismiller, and it is not clear from the face of her Second Amended Complaint that this claim\n\neven relates to the same injury – sexual abuse or harassment resulting from her relationship with\n\nWeismiller – upon which she bases her other claims in the case. In response to the District’s\n\nassertion that she improperly pleads her equal-protection claim based on “generalized\n\ngrievances,” however, Plaintiff argues that “generalized complaints” are not the basis for this\n\nclaim. Opp. at 25-26 (citing Mot. at 20). Rather, she “alleges that she was sexually abused by a\n\nShadd teacher who initiated sex with her in and outside of his classroom on numerous occasions,\n\ncausing her to become pregnant and give birth to a daughter.” Id. She “mentions the deplorable\n\neducational environment at Shadd only to illustrate that the District Defendants had no regard for\n\nsafety, well-being, and educational advancement, which ultimately resulted in Plaintiff being the\n\nvictim of sexual misconduct.” Id. at 26. “Weismiller’s sexual misconduct,” Plaintiff argues, “is\n\ntraceable to, among other things, the District’s custom and practice of responding inappropriately\n\nto allegations of sexual abuse and its failure to reprimand Weismiller.” Id.\n\n        As just explained above, Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to support her\n\nallegations that the District had a custom of responding inappropriately to allegations of sexual\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n \n\fabuse or that its failure to reprimand or terminate Weismiller can result in § 1983 liability. Even\n\nwere the Court to assume that Plaintiff is attempting to plead a municipal-liability claim based on\n\nthe District’s policy of enrolling emotionally disturbed students in Shadd while sending other\n\nspecial education students to other conceivably (in Plaintiff’s view) less dysfunctional schools,\n\nshe pleads nothing to suggest that that policy was the “moving force” behind Weismiller’s\n\nalleged sexual abuse. Canton, 489 U.S. at 388-89. No causal connection exists. Nor is there\n\nanything beyond the speculative that could link the “educational environment” at Shadd to\n\nWeismiller’s actions. The Supreme Court has held that, “[a]t the very least there must be an\n\naffirmative link between the policy and the particular constitutional violation alleged.” City of\n\nOklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823 (1985). Plaintiff has thus failed to plead a § 1983\n\nclaim based on an equal-protection violation arising from her status as an emotionally disturbed\n\nstudent.\n\n               2.      20 U.S.C. § 1681\n\n       Plaintiff’s final federal claim alleges a violation of 20 U.S.C. § 1681, commonly known\n\nas Title IX. Section 1681 provides:\n\n           No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\n           participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n           discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal\n           financial assistance . . . .\n\nAn injured plaintiff may obtain monetary damages for a violation of Title IX through a private\n\nsuit against a school district. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 725 (1979);\n\nFranklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 76 (1992). The Supreme Court has\n\ninterpreted Title IX to encompass and prohibit “a teacher’s sexual harassment of a student.”\n\nGebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274, 281 (1998) (citing Franklin,\n\n503 U.S. 60). In such cases, damages may only be recovered from the school district if an\n\n\n                                                20\n \n\f“appropriate person” – i.e., “an official of the school district who at a minimum ha[d] authority\n\nto institute corrective measures on the district’s behalf” – “ha[d] actual notice of, and [wa]s\n\ndeliberately indifferent to, the teacher’s misconduct.” Gebser, 524 U.S. at 277, 290. In other\n\nwords, a damages claim under Title IX will not lie against the District based on respondeat\n\nsuperior liability or merely constructive knowledge of a teacher’s sexual harassment of a student.\n\nId. at 285. To state a claim under § 1681, therefore, Plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to allege\n\n1) actual notice 2) to an appropriate person and 3) deliberate indifference.\n\n        The District challenges the Second Amended Complaint at all three stages of the Title IX\n\nanalysis, arguing that Plaintiff has not established actual notice to a District official or deliberate\n\nindifference. Plaintiff contends that she has done so. In her Second Amended Complaint,\n\nPlaintiff alleges that the “District of Columbia and DCPS had actual knowledge of Weismiller’s\n\nsexual relationship with Plaintiff, as shown by the pregnancy test she took at the school’s request\n\nin December 2008 and through interviews of teachers and staff who had seen Weismiller and\n\nPlaintiff alone together in his classroom.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 94 (emphasis added). She further\n\nalleges that the District and DCPS, “by failing to stop the sexual relationship before Plaintiff\n\nbecame pregnant and by failing to discipline Weismiller after conducting a formal investigation,\n\nexhibited deliberate indifference toward Plaintiff.” Id., ¶ 95 (emphasis added). A closer look\n\nshows Plaintiff claims too much.\n\n        In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that in December 2008,\n\napproximately one month after her sexual relationship with Weismiller began, she “reported to\n\nschool personnel . . . that she believed she was pregnant.” Id., ¶¶ 19, 37. These school personnel\n\n“sent her to the health office, which administered a pregnancy test that came back negative.” Id.,\n\n¶ 37. Plaintiff was 18 years old at the time. See id., ¶ 13. Notably, she does not allege that, in\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n \n\fDecember 2008, she told anyone, either at the school or elsewhere, that she was having a sexual\n\nrelationship with a teacher or that this relationship was why she believed she was pregnant.\n\nAdditionally, Plaintiff does not identify the “school personnel” she approached and does not\n\nplead any facts to suggest that they included any school district official with “authority to\n\ninstitute corrective measures.” Gebser, 524 U.S. at 277. The Court thus cannot conclude that, in\n\nDecember 2008, anyone at Shadd other than Plaintiff and Weismiller, let alone “an appropriate\n\nperson” for Title IX purposes, had actual knowledge of the nature of their relationship.\n\n       Plaintiff pleads that her sexual relationship with Weismiller ended in April 2009, see Sec.\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 20, and the District maintains that an appropriate person must have had actual\n\nknowledge of the relationship prior to its conclusion to support a claim under Title IX. The\n\nDistrict argues:\n\n           Although Plaintiff acknowledges that DCPS initiated an investigation in\n           May 2009 after purportedly learning that Plaintiff was pregnant, Plaintiff’s\n           Second Amended Complaint identifies no DCPS official who had actual\n           knowledge of the sexual encounters before that time but failed to respond,\n           nor does Plaintiff allege that the sexual encounters continued after DCPS\n           initiated its investigation.\n\nMot. at 24. The District faithfully summarizes Plaintiff’s factual pleadings on this question, and\n\nthere is certainly some legal support for its argument. See, e.g., Rosa H. v. San Elizario\n\nIndependent School Dist., 106 F.3d 648 (5th Cir. 1997). In Rosa H., the Fifth Circuit found:\n\n“Under the standard we announce today, the school district can be liable, if at all, only for the\n\ndamages caused by its intentional acts of discrimination. If the conduct has ceased by the time a\n\nsupervisory employee of the sort we describe here learns of it, there is no liability in a private\n\nsuit for that conduct based on some personal failure to take ‘proper remedial action’ thereafter.”\n\nId. at 661; see also Davis v. DeKalb County School District, 233 F.3d 1367, 1372 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (finding school district lacked actual knowledge required by Title IX that teacher sexually\n\n\n                                                 22\n \n\fharassed students during the 1993-94 school year when school official did not learn of\n\nharassment until September 1994). The Court could end its analysis here but will not since\n\nPlaintiff has also failed to plead that the District acquired actual knowledge of Plaintiff’s sexual\n\nrelationship with Weismiller through its May 2009 investigation.\n\n       Even if Plaintiff maintains that the District and DCPS obtained actual knowledge of her\n\nrelationship with Weismiller in May 2009 through interviews of Shadd teachers and staff\n\nconducted after Plaintiff became pregnant, the facts she pleads in her Second Amended\n\nComplaint again undermine the inferences she asks the Court to draw. In May 2009, she alleges\n\nDCPS “initiate[d] an investigation into the sexual relationship between Weismiller and Plaintiff.”\n\nSec. Am. Compl., ¶ 29. Plaintiff summarizes the results of DCPS’s interviews as follows:\n\n“Every witness who was interviewed by the DCPS stated either that they had seen Plaintiff and\n\nWeismiller alone together in his classroom, or had heard rumors that the two were having a\n\nsexual relationship.” Id., ¶ 31. Plaintiff identifies five teachers or staff members who confirmed\n\nthese reports. Id., ¶¶ 32-36. One of these witnesses reported seeing Plaintiff in Weismiller’s\n\nclassroom “during the lunch period, with the lights off,” and two reportedly expressed their\n\nconcerns about the amount of time Weismiller was spending with Plaintiff and the rumors they\n\nhad heard of a sexual relationship between the two. Id., ¶¶ 32, 35-36. Not one, however,\n\nreported observing inappropriate physical contact between Plaintiff and Weismiller, hearing\n\nfrom either party of the relationship, or learning solid facts to support its existence. Although\n\none teacher “entered Weismiller’s classroom during lunch on at least two occasions” “to\n\ninvestigate the[] rumors” she had heard, she only reported finding Plaintiff and Weismiller in the\n\nroom together, not that they appeared to be engaged in sexual conduct. Id., ¶ 34. Finally,\n\nWeismiller denied a having a sexual relationship with Plaintiff. Id., ¶ 30.\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n \n\f              Plaintiff does not even plead that she herself told anyone at Shadd or any other District\n\nofficial that she and Weismiller had a sexual relationship. Although she does allege that she,\n\n“her daughter, and Weismiller have taken paternity tests, and the results are positive,” she does\n\nnot plead that she obtained this information before Weismiller was fired in October 2009 or even\n\nbefore she filed this lawsuit.2 Id., ¶ 22.\n\n              Former Chancellor Rhee certainly had no actual knowledge of Weismiller’s sexual\n\nrelationship with Plaintiff at any time before the filing of this lawsuit, let alone prior to\n\nWeismiller’s termination from DCPS. Nothing in the Second Amended Complaint suggests\n\nRhee would have had any reason to know of the relationship while it was ongoing – i.e., in April\n\n2009 or earlier. The best Plaintiff can argue based on the facts that she pled is that school\n\nofficials knew or should have known of the relationship, a level of knowledge clearly insufficient\n\nto satisfy the demanding Gebser standard. See 524 U.S. at 285 (imposing liability based on\n\nschool district’s constructive knowledge of discrimination would “frustrate the purposes” of Title\n\nIX); see also Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S.\n\n629, 642 (1999) (The court in Gebser “declined the invitation to impose liability under what\n\namounted to a negligence standard – holding the district liable for its failure to react to teacher-\n\nstudent harassment of which it knew or should have known. Rather, we concluded that the\n\ndistrict could be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally acted in clear\n\nviolation of Title IX.”) (emphasis in original). Similarly, in Baynard, the Fourth Circuit found\n\nthat Malone, a school principal who had received multiple reports that a particular teacher had in\n\n\n                                                            \n              2\n            Plaintiff does state in her Opposition that Weismiller took this paternity test in “late August 2010.” Opp.\nat 2. While the Court will not consider facts appearing for the first time in Plaintiff’s Opposition brief, were it to do\nso, the timing of the paternity test would further cut against Plaintiff’s argument that the District had actual\nknowledge of her sexual relationship with Weismiller 1) at the time it was occurring, 2) at the time DCPS conducted\nits investigation, or 3) prior to Weismiller’s termination.\n\n                                                               24\n \n\fthe past abused a student and was reported to be inappropriately touching a current student, did\n\nnot have actual knowledge of the abuse. Id., 268 F.3d at 238. The Fourth Circuit found:\n\n“Although Malone certainly should have been aware of the potential for such abuse, and for this\n\nreason was properly held liable under § 1983, there is no evidence in the record to support a\n\nconclusion that Malone was in fact aware that a student was being abused.” Id. (emphasis in\n\noriginal). These facts are thus insufficient under Gebser to establish that anyone within DCPS\n\nhad actual knowledge of Weismiller’s sexual relationship with Plaintiff.\n\n       Even if the Court could infer that someone had actual knowledge, Plaintiff has not pled\n\nthat an “appropriate person” did. Indeed, she does not even identify in her Second Amended\n\nComplaint anyone within DCPS whom she alleges is an “appropriate person” for Title IX\n\npurposes. In her Opposition, she argues that “two teachers and numerous staff members\n\nsuspected Weismiller’s sexual misconduct” and cites T.Z. v. City of New York, 634 F. Supp. 2d\n\n263, 269 (E.D.N.Y. 2009), for the proposition that a teacher can be an “appropriate person”\n\nunder Title IX. Opp. at 26-27. The Court is not persuaded. Even if this suspicion could equate\n\nwith actual knowledge, which it cannot, Plaintiff still fails the “appropriate person” test.\n\n       Gebser makes clear that the “appropriate person” must be “an official who at a minimum\n\nhas authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the\n\nrecipient's behalf.” 524 U.S. at 290. Plaintiff does not allege in her Second Amended Complaint\n\nthat these teachers and staff members had the authority to take corrective action against\n\nWeismiller and does not explain in her Opposition why or how she believes this to be the case.\n\nPlaintiff’s citation to T.Z. does not support her cause. While this Court is free to disagree with\n\nT.Z., the facts of that case can also be distinguished from those here. In T.Z., a group of students\n\nsexually assaulted another student during class. See 634 F. Supp. 2d at 266. The court described\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n \n\fRaskin, the classroom teacher, as “a school official with the authority to intervene.” Id. at 269.\n\nThis Court does not opine on whether this type of “authority to intervene” is sufficient to\n\nestablish Title IX liability in peer-to-peer sexual harassment cases.\n\n       The Court agrees, however, with the Courts of Appeals of other Circuits that have\n\ndecided that, in the context of student-teacher sexual harassment, the “authority to take\n\ncorrective action” means the ability to fire or discipline the teacher in question. See Baynard,\n\n268 F.3d at 238-39; Rosa H., 106 F.3d at 660. Addressing the question of whether a school\n\nprincipal was an appropriate person under Title IX, under Virginia law, the Fourth Circuit found:\n\n“[N]o rational jury could find that [the principal] was invested with the power to take corrective\n\naction on behalf of the [school board]. . . . [W]hether a supervisory employee may be viewed as\n\nthe proxy of the school district depends upon whether the district has delegated to that employee\n\nthe traditional powers of an employer, e.g., the authority to hire and terminate employees.”\n\nBaynard, 268 F.3d at 238-39. The Fifth Circuit has identified the relevant persons as “those\n\nschool employees in the chain of command whom the school board has appointed to monitor the\n\nconduct of other employees and, as distinguished from reporting to others, remedy the\n\nwrongdoing themselves.” Rosa H., 106 F.3d at 660. These interpretations are consistent with\n\nthe purpose stated in Gebser – that a federal funding recipient not be subject to liability under\n\nTitle IX without notice of the discriminatory conduct and the opportunity to take remedial action.\n\nId. at 285-86, 290. The teachers and staff members Plaintiff points to in her Opposition are not\n\nsuch persons.\n\n       Independently, Plaintiff’s Title IX claim cannot survive because, even if she had\n\nadequately alleged that an appropriate person within DCPS had actual knowledge of her sexual\n\nrelationship with Weismiller, she has not pled sufficient facts to support her position that the\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n \n\fDistrict responded with deliberate indifference. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 95. A school district is\n\nnot deliberately indifferent to reports of sexual harassment of a student unless its “response was\n\n‘clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.’” Power ex rel. Power v. Gilbert\n\nPublic Schools, No. 10-15149, 2011 WL 4898079, at *1 (9th Cir. Oct. 14, 2011) (quoting Davis,\n\n526 U.S. at 648). In Power, the Ninth Circuit found the school district’s response not\n\nunreasonable where the evidence showed that school “officials timely and thoroughly\n\ninvestigated and responded to each” of the plaintiffs’ complaints. Id.\n\n       Plaintiff has not pled facts that would allow the Court to draw a reasonable inference that\n\nDCPS’s response in this case was unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. See J.M. ex\n\nrel. Morris v. Hilldale Independent School District No. 1-29, 397 Fed. Appx. 445, at *7 (10th\n\nCir. 2010) (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 649) (“The Supreme Court . . . has made clear that ‘[i]n an\n\nappropriate case, there is no reason why courts, on a motion to dismiss, . . . could not identify a\n\nresponse as not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law.’”). As Plaintiff has pled, “[A]fter\n\nlearning that [she] was pregnant” in May 2009, “DCPS initiate[d] an investigation into the sexual\n\nrelationship between Weismiller and Plaintiff.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 29. At least six teachers and\n\nstaff members at Shadd were interviewed, including Weismiller and one teacher who had\n\nattempted to investigate rumors of a sexual relationship by entering Weismiller’s classroom\n\nduring the lunch hour. Id., ¶¶ 30-37. According to Plaintiff, at the close of the investigation,\n\nRhee “said the statements by teachers and staff did not offer definitive proof of a sexual\n\nrelationship” and “characterized the situation as ‘a he said, she said.’” Id., ¶ 39. Ultimately,\n\nDCPS “found Weismiller not liable for ‘grave misconduct in office’ and not liable for ‘other\n\nfailure of good behavior during duty hours which is of such a nature that it causes discredit to the\n\nemployee’s agency or employment.’” Id., ¶ 38. In light of the breadth of this investigation and\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n \n\fits inconclusive results, DCPS can hardly be said to have acted with deliberate indifference by\n\nnot firing Weismiller then. Finally but significantly, Plaintiff “does not allege that further sexual\n\nharassment occurred as a result of [DCPS’s] deliberate indifference.” Escue v. Northern OK\n\nCollege, 450 F.3d 1146, 1155 (10th Cir. 2006). The Supreme Court has stated that “the\n\ndeliberate indifference must, at a minimum, cause students to undergo harassment or make them\n\nliable or vulnerable to it.” Davis, 536 U.S. at 645, quoted in Escue, 450 F.3d at 1155.\n\n       Given an appropriate person’s lack of actual knowledge of Plaintiff’s sexual relationship\n\nwith Weismiller, the extent of the investigation the District conducted, and the fact that the\n\nrelationship had ended before DCPS began its investigation, the Court finds as a matter of law\n\nthat Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead her Title IX claim.\n\n       C.      State Claims\n\n       Having prevailed on Plaintiff’s federal claims, the District next argues that Plaintiff’s\n\ncommon law causes of action against it “should be dismissed for failure to provide proper notice\n\nof her claims” under D.C. Code § 12-309. See Mot. at 24. Plaintiff’s common law claims\n\nagainst the District include negligent supervision, negligent hiring and retention, intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n       Section 12-309 of the D.C. Code states:\n\n            An action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia for\n            unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six months after\n            the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney\n            has given notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of Columbia of the\n            approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or\n            damage. A report in writing by the Metropolitan Police Department, in\n            the regular course of duty, is a sufficient notice under this section.\n\nCompliance with this notice requirement is a mandatory prerequisite for everyone with a tort\n\nclaim against the District of Columbia. See Blocker-Burnette v. District of Columbia, 730 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 200, 203 (D.D.C. 2010); District of Columbia v. Dunmore, 662 A.2d 1356, 1359 (D.C.\n                                                 28\n \n\f1995). Because filing suit against the District of Columbia represents a waiver of the District’s\n\nsovereign immunity, “section 12-309 is to be construed narrowly against claimants.” Dunmore,\n\n662 A.2d at 1359; see also Blocker-Burnette, 730 F. Supp. 2d at 203 (“Courts should strictly\n\nconstrue Section 12-309’s notice requirements.” (quoting Day v. District of Columbia Dep’t of\n\nConsumer & Regulatory Affairs, 191 F. Supp. 2d 154, 158 (D.D.C. 2002)).\n\n       Nowhere in her Second Amended Complaint does Plaintiff allege that she submitted\n\nwritten notice of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or damages\n\ndirectly to the Mayor of the District of Columbia. Instead, she alleges that “[t]he District of\n\nColumbia received notice of the circumstances giving rise to the claims herein, as required by\n\nD.C. Code § 12-309, pursuant to an investigative report completed by DCPS’s Division of\n\nSchool Security on August 21, 2009” (DCPS Report) and “in a May 13, 2010 letter.” See Sec.\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 12. Plaintiff alleges that the investigation resulting in the DCPS Report\n\ncommenced in May 2009. Id., ¶ 29. In her Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the DCPS Report\n\n“was circulated to DCPS’ legal department, among other school officials,” and “that Shadd\n\nPrincipal Alonzo Randall, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, and the\n\nUnited State’s [sic] Attorney’s Office were all told about the investigation.” Opp. at 7. Plaintiff\n\nhas not alleged that she, her agent, or her attorney sent the DCPS Report to the Mayor, or that the\n\nMetropolitan Police Department issued a written report in response to being told about the\n\ninvestigation.\n\n       Plaintiff cites Allen v. District of Columbia, 533 A.2d 1259, 1262 (D.C. 1987), for the\n\nproposition that “written notice by a claimant should not be a prerequisite to legal action if, in\n\nfact, actual notice in the form of a police report has been received by the District,” and suggests\n\nthat the DCPS Report is analogous to a police report in this respect. Opp. at 6-7. The Court\n\n\n                                                 29\n \n\fdisagrees. As courts in this District have previously held, “Only two types of notice can satisfy\n\nthe requirements of Section 12-309[]: (1) a written notice to the Mayor of the District of\n\nColumbia, or (2) a police report prepared in the regular course of duty.” Blocker-Burnette, 730\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 204 (citing Brown v. District of Columbia, 251 F. Supp. 2d 152, 165 (D.D.C.\n\n2003)). Courts have thus previously found that neither complaints made to District of Columbia\n\nagencies other than the Mayor’s office nor reports of investigations prepared by agencies other\n\nthan the Metropolitan Police Department qualify as notice under § 12-309. See Blocker-\n\nBurnette, 730 F. Supp. 2d at 204 (“Because the notice requirement must be strictly construed . . .\n\nthe Court cannot conclude that plaintiff’s filing with the [District of Columbia Office of Human\n\nRights] substituted for written notice to the Mayor.”); Brown v. District of Columbia, 251 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 152, 165 (D.D.C. 2003) (finding plaintiff failed to comply with § 12-309 and granting\n\nsummary judgment where plaintiff sent letter to MPD Chief, D.C. Corporation Counsel, Police\n\nand Fire Clinic, and attorney in United States Attorney’s Office, but not to the Mayor, and did\n\nnot file a police report). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has concluded that the\n\n“statutory exception [in § 12-309] to formal notice [to the Mayor] is limited to police reports.”\n\nCampbell v. District of Columbia, 568 A.2d 1076, 1078 (D.C. 1990) (citing Jenkins v. District of\n\nColumbia, 379 A.2d 1177, 1178 (D.C. 1977) (finding Fire Department report not equivalent to\n\npolice report for purposes of § 12-309)). In the only case cited by the parties addressing the\n\nquestion of whether a DCPS Division of School Security investigative report provides the\n\nrequisite notice under § 12-309, a court found that it did not. See Whittaker v. District of\n\nColumbia, No. 01-1403, 2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 27801, at *16-21 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\n       Plaintiff identifies two additional written documents that she alleges put the District of\n\nColumbia on actual notice of her claims – an April 13, 2010, email from Plaintiff’s counsel to\n\n\n\n                                                30\n \n\fDistrict of Columbia Attorney General Peter Nickles, and a May 13, 2010, letter from Plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel to the District of Columbia Office of Risk Management. See Opp. at 7, 9. Plaintiff\n\nmentions the April 13 email for the first time in her Opposition, and she pleads in her Second\n\nAmended Complaint nothing about the May 13 letter beyond the fact that she “gave the District\n\nof Columbia notice of this lawsuit” therein. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 12. She does not allege that\n\neither of these documents was sent to the Mayor. Even if the Court could consider these\n\nadditional facts, it is undisputed that both of these documents were sent more than six months\n\nafter Plaintiff’s alleged injury or damage was sustained.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff’s reliance on Hurd v. District of Columbia, 106 A.2d 702 (D.C. 1954),\n\nand Rieser v. District of Columbia, 563 F.2d 462 (D.C. Cir. 1977), does not alter the outcome.\n\nIn Hurd, the plaintiff did provide notice, via a letter to the District of Columbia commissioners,\n\nunder § 12-309. The sufficiency of the notice was at issue because the plaintiff had incorrectly\n\nlisted the address of the building outside of which she had fallen. See 106 A.2d at 704-05.\n\nBased on the description of the location, coupled with the erroneous address, however, the court\n\nfound that there was “no doubt that the District could have located the place of injury,” and that\n\nthe “statutory purpose” of § 12-309 had been satisfied. Id. at 704. In Rieser, the plaintiff had a\n\npolice report – the acceptable alternative to a notice to the mayor – and the question was again\n\none of sufficiency. See 563 F.2d at 476. The District complained that “it was not afforded\n\nnotice of the causal connection between the injury and any negligent acts of its agents, and that it\n\nwas entitled to but did not receive timely notice of Rieser’s intention to bring suit.” Id. Finding\n\nthat this additional information was not required by the statute, the court found Rieser’s notice to\n\nthe District sufficient. Id. Unlike the present case, the question in both Hurd and Rieser was not\n\nwhether those plaintiffs had complied with § 12-309 at all, but whether they had done so\n\n\n\n                                                31\n \n\fsufficiently. Plaintiff cannot claim to have done so at all. For this reason, Plaintiff’s common\n\nlaw claims against the District must be dismissed.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons articulated herein, an Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion\n\nwill grant the District Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.\n\n                                                     /s/ James E.

The last three, collectively referred to as the “District\n\nDefendants,” have now filed a Motion to Dismiss. As Plaintiff’s federal claims are all legally\n\ndeficient, and as her state-law claims are barred by her failure to provide timely notice to the\n\nDistrict, the Court will grant the Motion. The case may proceed against Weismiller alone.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that while she was a student in his\n\nclass, Weismiller, then a DCPS teacher, initiated and engaged in a sexual relationship with her\n\nfrom November 2008 to April 2009. Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 19-20. During this time, Plaintiff\n\nbecame pregnant and in late 2009 gave birth to Weismiller’s daughter. Id., ¶ 21. In May 2009,\n\n\n                                                 1\n \n\fDCPS officials learned of Plaintiff’s pregnancy and conducted an investigation into her\n\nrelationship with Weismiller. Id., ¶ 29. Weismiller denied having had a sexual relationship with\n\nPlaintiff, and while other DCPS teachers and staff members reported frequently seeing Plaintiff\n\nand Weismiller alone in his classroom, sometimes with the lights off, no one reported observing\n\nany inappropriate physical contact between them. See id., ¶¶ 30-36. Following this\n\ninvestigation, DCPS concluded that there was no “definitive proof” Weismiller had engaged in\n\nany wrongdoing. Id., ¶¶ 38-39. He was nevertheless fired the following October as part of a\n\nsystem-wide reduction in force. Id., ¶ 14.\n\n       Plaintiff also alleges that she was not the first student with whom Weismiller initiated a\n\nsexual relationship. Beginning in 1976, she pleads, while teaching high school in Prince\n\nGeorge’s County, Maryland, Weismiller initiated sexual relationships with two of his students.\n\nId., ¶ 24. In 1984, while teaching middle school in Prince William County, Virginia, Plaintiff\n\nalleges Weismiller sexually assaulted two eighth grade students, which resulted in a lawsuit\n\nagainst him and the school board and his subsequent termination. Id., ¶ 26. Prior to hiring\n\nWeismiller, Plaintiff asserts, Defendants in the present case “knew or should have known that\n\nWeismiller had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with students in the past.” Id., ¶\n\n61. With respect to the Transition Academy at Shadd, Plaintiff alleges that it is “a failure, where\n\nstudents are inadequately supervised and subject to injury.” Id., ¶ 46.\n\n       On September 7, 2010, Plaintiff brought this action against the District of Columbia,\n\nDCPS, and Rhee, in her capacity as former Chancellor of DCPS, and against Weismiller,\n\nalleging negligent supervision, negligent hiring and retention, and a violation of 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1681 et seq. against the District Defendants, and intentional infliction of emotional distress,\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty, and a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against all Defendants. Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n \n\ffiled her Amended Complaint on September 21, 2010, and her Second Amended Complaint on\n\nMay 11, 2011. Now before the Court is the District Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss; Defendant\n\nWeismiller has not moved to dismiss the claims against him. For the reasons set forth below, the\n\nCourt will grant the District Defendants’ Motion.\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a\n\ncomplaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” In evaluating Defendants’\n\nMotion to Dismiss, the Court must “treat the complaint’s factual allegations as true . . . and must\n\ngrant plaintiff ‘the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Sparrow\n\nv.

Analysis\n\n        The District Defendants first contend that Plaintiff improperly names DCPS and former\n\nChancellor Rhee as defendants in this action. Next they challenge Plaintiff’s federal claims\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 20 U.S.C. § 1681 on the ground that she has failed to sufficiently\n\nplead the required elements. Finally, they maintain that Plaintiff’s state-common-law claims\n\nmust be dismissed because she failed to comply with the notice requirements of D.C. Code § 12-\n\n309. The Court will address each of these arguments in turn.\n\n        A.     DCPS and Chancellor Rhee\n\n               1.      DCPS\n\n        The District Defendants first move to dismiss DCPS as a defendant in this suit on the\n\nground that “DCPS is a subordinate governmental agency within the District of Columbia\n\ngovernment and as a result is non sui juris.” Mot. at 5 (citing Hinson ex rel. N.H. v. Merritt\n\nEducational Center, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Opp. at 27-28. Plaintiff cites Monell\n\nfor the proposition that “school entities, such as a school board or school system, are ‘persons’\n\nsubject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Id. at 28 (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 690, 697-99).\n\nThis is the sole authority she cites in support of her position that DCPS is a proper party to this\n\nsuit.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n \n\f       Courts in this District have held on numerous recent occasions that DCPS is non sui juris\n\n– that is, non-suable as an entity separate from the District of Columbia.

Judge Bates\n\nclarified that the Supreme Court’s decision in Monell\n\n           does not indicate that municipal liability must attach to school boards\n           directly, where another municipal entity is the entity legally responsible\n           for the school board's liabilities. Thus, where, as here, municipal liability\n           may attach simply by suing the proper municipal defendant -- the District\n           of Columbia or one of its officials, as opposed to DCPS -- Monell does not\n           mandate that § 1983 actions must lie against school boards.\n\nId. at *4. He thus concluded: “Because DCPS is not a suable entity under the D.C. Code, and\n\nfederal law does not require DCPS to be the named municipal defendant, the Court grants\n\nDCPS’s motion to dismiss.” Id.\n\n       As this Court concurs with these decisions, all of Plaintiff’s claims against DCPS must be\n\ndismissed.

Am. Compl., ¶ 13. The Court is aware of only one case in which a court squarely addressed\n\nthe question of whether an 18-year-old high school student could state such a claim. See Henry\n\nv. Toups, No. 08-939, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3398857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D.

In that case, Toups, a high\n\nschool band teacher, was sued by two of his students with whom he had engaged in sexual\n\nrelations, including Henry, who was already 18 at the time. Id. at *1. Toups argued that his\n\nrelationship with Henry amounted to consensual sex between adults and therefore could not be\n\nthe basis for a constitutional tort. Id. at *2. Citing Doe v. Taylor Independent School District,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661734\"><a href=\"/opinion/661734/jane-doe-v-taylor-independent-school-district-mike-caplinger-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court found that the “Fifth Circuit does not distinguish between the age of\n\nschool children”: “Jane Doe's substantive due process claims are grounded upon the premise that\n\nschool children – [it] doesn’t say school children who are under 18 – school children have a\n\nliberty interest in their bodily integrity that is protected by the due process laws of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, and upon the premise that physical abuse by a school employee violates that right.”\n\nId. at *7. Conversely, in Douglas v. Brookville Area School District, No. 10-1087, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">6116449</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D. Pa. Dec. 8, 2011), the court questioned whether the “seemingly consensual\n\nnature” of a relationship between a fifteen-year-old student and a teacher at her high school\n\nshould weigh against a finding that the teacher’s actions were conscience-shocking and a\n\nviolation of the student’s right to bodily integrity, writing, “[T]he Court is ‘reluctant to expand\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n \n\fthe concept of substantive due process’ beyond the context of coercive activities without the\n\nbenefit of adequate briefing from the parties.” Id. at *15.\n\n          Although this is an interesting question, the Court need not resolve it; indeed, the District\n\nhas chosen not even to pursue this line of argument. As the District has not raised such a\n\nchallenge, and in the absence of clear authority, the Court will assume without deciding that\n\nPlaintiff can allege a substantive due process violation relating to bodily integrity against\n\nWeismiller and, to the extent the violation was caused by a policy or custom of DCPS, against\n\nthe District. The Court thus turns to whether Plaintiff has adequately alleged municipal liability\n\nin connection with such a violation.\n\n          Plaintiff argues that she has adequately pled three District decisions, customs, policies, or\n\npractices that support her claim that the District is liable for Weismiller’s violation of her bodily\n\nintegrity: 1) “failing to investigate Weismiller’s background before hiring him,” 2) “cultivating\n\nan atmosphere where teachers are afraid to report abuse,” and 3) “failing to terminate Weismiller\n\nfor cause after learning of his misconduct.” Opp. at 15; see Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 82-84, 86-87.\n\n                                i.       Failure to investigate background\n\n          Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support her claim that the District has a\n\n“custom, policy or practice of failing to adequately investigate the backgrounds of its teachers\n\nbefore hiring them” that caused her to suffer a violation of her right to bodily integrity. Sec. Am.\n\nCompl., ¶¶ 82, 87. All that she has alleged is that, since 1976, Weismiller has been involved in\n\n“inappropriate sexual relationships with at least four other students at other schools in the\n\nWashington, D.C. area,” and that the District, DCPS, and Rhee “knew or should have known that\n\nWeismiller had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with students in the past.” Id., ¶¶\n\n23, 61.\n\n\n\n                                                    10\n \n\f       Courts that have considered the elements of a § 1983 claim alleging liability arising from\n\na municipality’s hiring policies or practices have concluded that, “[i]n order to prove that a\n\nmunicipal hiring or training policy violated his rights under § 1983, [a plaintiff] must show that\n\n(1) the training or hiring procedures of the municipality's policymaker were inadequate; (2) the\n\nmunicipality's policymaker was deliberately indifferent in adopting the hiring or training policy;\n\nand (3) the inadequate hiring or training policy directly caused the plaintiff's injury.” Benavides\n\nv.

Plaintiff does not identify any official District policy on pre-hiring\n\nbackground checks of DCPS teachers or allege how a District policymaker was deliberately\n\nindifferent in adopting such a policy. Opp. at 14-15. Other than Weismiller’s, she does not even\n\npoint to any other background checks that she alleges were performed inadequately that could\n\nestablish a custom “so widespread as to have the force of law.” Board of the County\n\nCommissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118104\"><a href=\"/opinion/118104/board-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403-04 (1997). Realizing that she has\n\nnot identified any actual District policy or practice, Plaintiff falls back on the argument that “[i]t\n\nis well-established that a plaintiff can state a valid municipal liability claim by alleging a\n\ndecision by a municipality to hire an employee without adequately investigating that employee’s\n\nbackground.” Opp. at 15 (citing Brown, 520 U.S. at 412). In other words, Plaintiff grounds her\n\nclaim on the single hiring of Weismiller. Plaintiff’s reading of Brown, however, overstates the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in that case. Far from recognizing such a well-established claim, the\n\nCourt in Brown merely considered how a plaintiff might plead such a claim without causing\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n \n\fmunicipal liability based on policy or custom to collapse into respondeat superior liability.\n\nBrown, 520 U.S. at 412. The Court “assum[ed] without deciding that proof of a single instance\n\nof inadequate screening could . . . trigger municipal liability,” but found the evidence before it\n\ninsufficient to sustain such a claim. Id.\n\n       Underlying the Supreme Court’s analysis in Brown, however, was the County’s\n\nstipulation that Sheriff Moore, who made the hiring decision in question, was a final municipal\n\npolicymaker. Id. at 397. This concession provided the key to unlocking the plaintiff’s potential\n\nmunicipal-liability claims. The Supreme Court has held that “municipal liability may be\n\nimposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.”\n\nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (1986). The standard for such a claim,\n\nhowever, is stringent. In such a case, “municipal liability under § 1983 attaches where – and\n\nonly where – a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various\n\nalternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the\n\nsubject matter in question.” Id. at 483. Limiting the single decisions that trigger municipal\n\nliability to those made by final policymakers is necessary to prevent the liability described by\n\nMonell and its progeny from being transformed into respondeat superior liability. It is thus\n\nnecessary in such cases to distinguish between “an exercise of policymaking authority and an\n\nexercise of delegated discretionary policy-implementing authority.” Brown, 520 U.S. at 434\n\n(emphasis in original); see also Triplett v.

See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 82 (District has “a custom, policy or practice of failing to\n\nadequately investigate the backgrounds of its teachers before hiring them”); cf. id., ¶ 86 (“the\n\ndecision not to terminate Weismiller after DCPS investigated his sexual relationship with\n\nPlaintiff was made by a final municipal decisionmaker and is properly attributable to” the\n\nDistrict) (emphasis added); cf. also Singletary v.

For this reason, she has failed to state a claim\n\nfor municipal liability based on a policy manifested through a final policymaker’s single hiring\n\ndecision.\n\n                             ii.       Teachers afraid to report abuse\n\n       Plaintiff’s second argument on substantive due process is similarly unavailing. She does\n\nnot plead a single fact in support of her claim that the District has a custom of “cultivating an\n\natmosphere where teachers are afraid to report abuse,” making this allegation solely “upon\n\ninformation and belief.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 84. While “detailed factual allegations” are not\n\nnecessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, Plaintiff must put\n\nforth “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is\n\nliable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation omitted); see also\n\nAtchinson v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710872\"><a href=\"/opinion/710872/richard-atchinson-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422-423, (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“a section 1983\n\ncomplaint alleging municipal liability must include some factual basis for the allegation of a\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n \n\fmunicipal policy or custom”). Without any factual support for her claims that DCPS teachers are\n\nafraid to report abuse in schools, that DCPS officials cultivated an atmosphere that created such a\n\nfear, or that this fear led to underreporting of abuse on other occasions, the Court cannot\n\nreasonably infer that any misconduct in the present case was the result of such a District custom,\n\npolicy, or practice.\n\n                            iii.      Failure to terminate Weismiller\n\n        Plaintiff’s final argument, based on DCPS’s failure to terminate Weismiller in light of the\n\nevents underlying her claims, also comes up short. Here she concededly does allege that “the\n\ndecision not to terminate Weismiller after DCPS investigated his sexual relationship with\n\nPlaintiff was made by a final municipal decisionmaker and is properly attributable to the\n\nDistrict.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 86. Plaintiff, however, has not pled the identity of the District\n\nofficial who made the decision not to terminate Weismiller and argues that she need not do so to\n\nwithstand Defendants’ Motion. In any event, whether a particular District official has “final\n\npolicymaking authority is a question of state law.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483. A particular\n\nofficial “may have discretion to hire and fire employees without also being the [District] official\n\nresponsible for establishing county employment policy,” and “[t]he fact that a particular official\n\n– even a policymaking official – has discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not,\n\nwithout more, give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion.” Id. at 481-\n\n82, 484 n.12. The Court need not decide, however, whether Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that\n\na final policymaker is responsible for the decision not to fire Weismiller because her claim here\n\nfails on another ground: she has not pled causation.\n\n        Even if the decision to retain Weismiller following the investigation into his relationship\n\nwith Plaintiff was made or ratified by a final District policymaker, it must also be “the moving\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n \n\fforce behind the injury of which [she] complains” in order to subject the District to § 1983\n\nliability.

Ysleta Independent School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609767\"><a href=\"/opinion/609767/gloria-gonzalez-individually-and-as-next-friends-of-jessica-gonzalez-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762 n.13 (5th Cir. 1993) (“The district court also should have instructed the jury that\n\nthe school district could be held liable if its policies were ‘the “moving force [behind] the\n\nconstitutional violation.”’”) (quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 389-90); Singletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n90. The facts Plaintiff pleads in her Second Amended Complaint belie such an inference. She\n\nconcedes that her relationship with Weismiller concluded in April 2009. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶\n\n20. Yet, DCPS did not investigate Weismiller’s relationship with Plaintiff until May 2009 and\n\nonly thereafter made the decision not to terminate him. Id., ¶¶ 29, 38-39. As Plaintiff’s alleged\n\nharm in this case is her sexual relationship with Weismiller, a District decision made only after\n\nthat harm occurred cannot be said to be the “moving force” behind her injury.\n\n        Cases in which plaintiffs have sought to impose municipal liability on a school district for\n\nfailing to take disciplinary action against a teacher following allegations of sexual abuse or\n\nharassment have arisen in cases involving two such incidents, in which the plaintiffs point to the\n\nschool district’s improper response to a prior allegation of abuse as a policy that caused their\n\nsubsequent injury. See Gonzales, 996 F.2d at 746 (parents of student molested by her first-grade\n\nteacher alleged § 1983 claim based on school board’s decision to keep teacher in classroom\n\nfollowing similar allegations of sexual abuse two years earlier); Riddick v.

Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n \n\fcontends that cases like Henry v.

In Henry, the plaintiff did not just present evidence of post-event\n\ndeliberate indifference. He also presented several declarations of others’ similar experiences;\n\nsignificant evidence of bad intent by the state actors who violated his rights; and continued\n\nthreats throughout his ordeal.” Mejia v. City of Sacramento, 177 Fed. Appx. 661, 665 (9th Cir.\n\n2006). This was also the case in Fundiller v. City of Cooper City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461311\"><a href=\"/opinion/461311/michael-jamie-fundiller-and-rae-winder-fundiller-his-wife-plaintiffs-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.\n\n1985), where the plaintiff’s complaint alleged that the city had “adopted a custom by acting with\n\ngross indifference to the conduct engaged in by its police officers, including repeated failures to\n\nfollow police procedure, unnecessary use of excessive force, roughness and shootings at the time\n\nof making arrests, intimidation during arrests and booking procedures, and drug trafficking.” Id.\n\nat 1442. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that “a persistent failure to take disciplinary action\n\nagainst officers can give rise to the inference that a municipality has ratified conduct, thereby\n\nestablishing a ‘custom’ within the meaning of Monell.” Id. at 1443 (emphasis added). If\n\nPlaintiff here bases her claim on a single decision by a final policymaker after her injury, these\n\ncases offer no support.\n\n       She has, therefore, failed to adequately plead the existence of a District policy or custom\n\nthat caused a violation of her substantive due process right to bodily integrity.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n \n\f                                            b. Equal Protection\n\n              Plaintiff next alleges that she has been denied equal protection of the law under the Fifth\n\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause, based either on her gender or her status as an emotionally\n\ndisturbed student.1 With respect to gender discrimination, Plaintiff alleges that by engaging in a\n\nsexual relationship with her, Weismiller “violated Plaintiff’s right . . . to be free from\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of her sex,” and that the District’s “customs, policies and practices\n\nalso have violated Plaintiff’s rights . . . to be free from discrimination on the basis of her sex.”\n\nSec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 92, 88. Plaintiff’s Opposition makes clear that this claim is also based a\n\ntheory of municipal liability as articulated by Monell and its progeny. See Opp. at 22-23.\n\nPlaintiff argues that her allegations that “the District has a custom of responding inappropriately\n\nto allegations of sexual misconduct, and a custom of cultivating an atmosphere where teachers\n\nare afraid to report abuse” support this claim. Id. at 23 (citing Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 83-84). She\n\nfurther argues that she “knows that the District responded inadequately after becoming aware of\n\nher sexual abuse, and she alleges that other females encountered identical problems.” Opp. at\n\n23. Finally, Plaintiff cites the District’s decision to “acquit[] Weismiller of any misconduct” and\n\nChancellor Rhee’s description of the results of the investigation as a “he said, she said” as\n\nevidence of intentional misconduct on the part of the District. Id. at 22 (citing Sec. Am. Compl.,\n\n¶¶ 38, 39, 83).\n\n              These allegations are insufficient to state a claim of municipal liability on the part of the\n\nDistrict.

While Plaintiff argues that “other females [have] encountered\n\nidentical problems” with “the District responding inadequately after becoming aware of . . .\n\nsexual abuse,” she does so for the first time in her Opposition to this Motion. Opp. at 23. This\n\nallegation, let alone facts to support it, appear nowhere in her Second Amended Complaint and\n\nthus cannot form a basis for her claim. See Henthorne v. Dep’t of the Navy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674585\"><a href=\"/opinion/674585/donald-gene-henthorn-v-department-of-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688-89\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n        The only evidence Plaintiff offers in support of her contention that the District has “a\n\ncustom, policy or practice of responding inappropriately to allegations of sexual misconduct that\n\ninjures female students” relates to the District’s handing of Plaintiff’s own sexual relationship\n\nwith Weismiller. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 83. Yet Plaintiff points to no official District policy as\n\nthe alleged cause of this inappropriate response, and to the extent she bases her claim on the\n\nexistence of such a DCPS or District custom, she has failed to show more than one occurrence of\n\nthe practice, let alone a custom “so widespread as to have the force of law.” Brown, 520 U.S. at\n\n403-04; see also Atchinson v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710872\"><a href=\"/opinion/710872/richard-atchinson-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“‘[p]roof\n\nof a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not sufficient to impose liability under Monell’\n\nabsent proof that the activity was caused by a municipal policy”) (quoting City of Oklahoma\n\nCity v. Tuttle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823-24 (1985)). Finally, if Plaintiff bases her claim on the\n\nDistrict’s decision “to acquit[] Weismiller of any misconduct,” as explained in Section\n\nIII.B.1.a.iii, supra, the evidence she pleads is insufficient.\n\n        The second equal-protection violation Plaintiff alleges is based on her status as an\n\nemotionally disturbed student. She has pled that the District has “a custom, policy or practice of\n\ninappropriately handing special education students, as demonstrated by the many failures at\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n \n\fShadd, including fighting in the hallways and numerous statements by DCPS officials that the\n\nschool is a disaster and should be closed.” See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 85. The District’s customs,\n\npolicies or practices, Plaintiff alleges, “have further violated Plaintiff’s rights . . . in that Plaintiff,\n\nas an emotionally disturbed student, has been treated differently by the District of Columbia and\n\nDCPS than other special education students. Specifically, Plaintiff has been placed at Shadd,\n\nwhich suffers from inadequate staffing and supervision, while other special education students\n\nhave remained at other schools.” Id., ¶ 89.\n\n        Plaintiff does not plead a corresponding predicate constitutional violation against\n\nWeismiller, and it is not clear from the face of her Second Amended Complaint that this claim\n\neven relates to the same injury – sexual abuse or harassment resulting from her relationship with\n\nWeismiller – upon which she bases her other claims in the case. In response to the District’s\n\nassertion that she improperly pleads her equal-protection claim based on “generalized\n\ngrievances,” however, Plaintiff argues that “generalized complaints” are not the basis for this\n\nclaim. Opp. at 25-26 (citing Mot. at 20). Rather, she “alleges that she was sexually abused by a\n\nShadd teacher who initiated sex with her in and outside of his classroom on numerous occasions,\n\ncausing her to become pregnant and give birth to a daughter.” Id. She “mentions the deplorable\n\neducational environment at Shadd only to illustrate that the District Defendants had no regard for\n\nsafety, well-being, and educational advancement, which ultimately resulted in Plaintiff being the\n\nvictim of sexual misconduct.” Id. at 26. “Weismiller’s sexual misconduct,” Plaintiff argues, “is\n\ntraceable to, among other things, the District’s custom and practice of responding inappropriately\n\nto allegations of sexual abuse and its failure to reprimand Weismiller.” Id.\n\n        As just explained above, Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to support her\n\nallegations that the District had a custom of responding inappropriately to allegations of sexual\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n \n\fabuse or that its failure to reprimand or terminate Weismiller can result in § 1983 liability. Even\n\nwere the Court to assume that Plaintiff is attempting to plead a municipal-liability claim based on\n\nthe District’s policy of enrolling emotionally disturbed students in Shadd while sending other\n\nspecial education students to other conceivably (in Plaintiff’s view) less dysfunctional schools,\n\nshe pleads nothing to suggest that that policy was the “moving force” behind Weismiller’s\n\nalleged sexual abuse. Canton, 489 U.S. at 388-89. No causal connection exists. Nor is there\n\nanything beyond the speculative that could link the “educational environment” at Shadd to\n\nWeismiller’s actions. The Supreme Court has held that, “[a]t the very least there must be an\n\naffirmative link between the policy and the particular constitutional violation alleged.” City of\n\nOklahoma City v. Tuttle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823 (1985). Plaintiff has thus failed to plead a § 1983\n\nclaim based on an equal-protection violation arising from her status as an emotionally disturbed\n\nstudent.\n\n               2.      20 U.S.C. § 1681\n\n       Plaintiff’s final federal claim alleges a violation of 20 U.S.C. § 1681, commonly known\n\nas Title IX. Section 1681 provides:\n\n           No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\n           participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n           discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal\n           financial assistance . . . .\n\nAn injured plaintiff may obtain monetary damages for a violation of Title IX through a private\n\nsuit against a school district.

In such cases, damages may only be recovered from the school district if an\n\n\n                                                20\n \n\f“appropriate person” – i.e., “an official of the school district who at a minimum ha[d] authority\n\nto institute corrective measures on the district’s behalf” – “ha[d] actual notice of, and [wa]s\n\ndeliberately indifferent to, the teacher’s misconduct.” Gebser, 524 U.S. at 277, 290. In other\n\nwords, a damages claim under Title IX will not lie against the District based on respondeat\n\nsuperior liability or merely constructive knowledge of a teacher’s sexual harassment of a student.\n\nId. at 285. To state a claim under § 1681, therefore, Plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to allege\n\n1) actual notice 2) to an appropriate person and 3) deliberate indifference.\n\n        The District challenges the Second Amended Complaint at all three stages of the Title IX\n\nanalysis, arguing that Plaintiff has not established actual notice to a District official or deliberate\n\nindifference. Plaintiff contends that she has done so. In her Second Amended Complaint,\n\nPlaintiff alleges that the “District of Columbia and DCPS had actual knowledge of Weismiller’s\n\nsexual relationship with Plaintiff, as shown by the pregnancy test she took at the school’s request\n\nin December 2008 and through interviews of teachers and staff who had seen Weismiller and\n\nPlaintiff alone together in his classroom.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 94 (emphasis added). She further\n\nalleges that the District and DCPS, “by failing to stop the sexual relationship before Plaintiff\n\nbecame pregnant and by failing to discipline Weismiller after conducting a formal investigation,\n\nexhibited deliberate indifference toward Plaintiff.” Id., ¶ 95 (emphasis added). A closer look\n\nshows Plaintiff claims too much.\n\n        In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that in December 2008,\n\napproximately one month after her sexual relationship with Weismiller began, she “reported to\n\nschool personnel . . . that she believed she was pregnant.” Id., ¶¶ 19, 37. These school personnel\n\n“sent her to the health office, which administered a pregnancy test that came back negative.” Id.,\n\n¶ 37. Plaintiff was 18 years old at the time. See id., ¶ 13. Notably, she does not allege that, in\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n \n\fDecember 2008, she told anyone, either at the school or elsewhere, that she was having a sexual\n\nrelationship with a teacher or that this relationship was why she believed she was pregnant.\n\nAdditionally, Plaintiff does not identify the “school personnel” she approached and does not\n\nplead any facts to suggest that they included any school district official with “authority to\n\ninstitute corrective measures.” Gebser, 524 U.S. at 277. The Court thus cannot conclude that, in\n\nDecember 2008, anyone at Shadd other than Plaintiff and Weismiller, let alone “an appropriate\n\nperson” for Title IX purposes, had actual knowledge of the nature of their relationship.\n\n       Plaintiff pleads that her sexual relationship with Weismiller ended in April 2009, see Sec.\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 20, and the District maintains that an appropriate person must have had actual\n\nknowledge of the relationship prior to its conclusion to support a claim under Title IX. The\n\nDistrict argues:\n\n           Although Plaintiff acknowledges that DCPS initiated an investigation in\n           May 2009 after purportedly learning that Plaintiff was pregnant, Plaintiff’s\n           Second Amended Complaint identifies no DCPS official who had actual\n           knowledge of the sexual encounters before that time but failed to respond,\n           nor does Plaintiff allege that the sexual encounters continued after DCPS\n           initiated its investigation.\n\nMot. at 24. The District faithfully summarizes Plaintiff’s factual pleadings on this question, and\n\nthere is certainly some legal support for its argument. See, e.g., Rosa H. v. San Elizario\n\nIndependent School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735349\"><a href=\"/opinion/735349/rosa-h-individually-and-as-next-friend-of-deborah-h-v-san-elizario/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1997). In Rosa H., the Fifth Circuit found:\n\n“Under the standard we announce today, the school district can be liable, if at all, only for the\n\ndamages caused by its intentional acts of discrimination. If the conduct has ceased by the time a\n\nsupervisory employee of the sort we describe here learns of it, there is no liability in a private\n\nsuit for that conduct based on some personal failure to take ‘proper remedial action’ thereafter.”\n\nId. at 661; see also Davis v. DeKalb County School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771319\"><a href=\"/opinion/771319/edith-davis-as-legal-guardian-on-behalf-of-jane-doe-individually-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1372 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (finding school district lacked actual knowledge required by Title IX that teacher sexually\n\n\n                                                 22\n \n\fharassed students during the 1993-94 school year when school official did not learn of\n\nharassment until September 1994). The Court could end its analysis here but will not since\n\nPlaintiff has also failed to plead that the District acquired actual knowledge of Plaintiff’s sexual\n\nrelationship with Weismiller through its May 2009 investigation.\n\n       Even if Plaintiff maintains that the District and DCPS obtained actual knowledge of her\n\nrelationship with Weismiller in May 2009 through interviews of Shadd teachers and staff\n\nconducted after Plaintiff became pregnant, the facts she pleads in her Second Amended\n\nComplaint again undermine the inferences she asks the Court to draw. In May 2009, she alleges\n\nDCPS “initiate[d] an investigation into the sexual relationship between Weismiller and Plaintiff.”\n\nSec. Am. Compl., ¶ 29. Plaintiff summarizes the results of DCPS’s interviews as follows:\n\n“Every witness who was interviewed by the DCPS stated either that they had seen Plaintiff and\n\nWeismiller alone together in his classroom, or had heard rumors that the two were having a\n\nsexual relationship.” Id., ¶ 31. Plaintiff identifies five teachers or staff members who confirmed\n\nthese reports. Id., ¶¶ 32-36. One of these witnesses reported seeing Plaintiff in Weismiller’s\n\nclassroom “during the lunch period, with the lights off,” and two reportedly expressed their\n\nconcerns about the amount of time Weismiller was spending with Plaintiff and the rumors they\n\nhad heard of a sexual relationship between the two. Id., ¶¶ 32, 35-36. Not one, however,\n\nreported observing inappropriate physical contact between Plaintiff and Weismiller, hearing\n\nfrom either party of the relationship, or learning solid facts to support its existence. Although\n\none teacher “entered Weismiller’s classroom during lunch on at least two occasions” “to\n\ninvestigate the[] rumors” she had heard, she only reported finding Plaintiff and Weismiller in the\n\nroom together, not that they appeared to be engaged in sexual conduct. Id., ¶ 34. Finally,\n\nWeismiller denied a having a sexual relationship with Plaintiff. Id., ¶ 30.\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n \n\f              Plaintiff does not even plead that she herself told anyone at Shadd or any other District\n\nofficial that she and Weismiller had a sexual relationship. Although she does allege that she,\n\n“her daughter, and Weismiller have taken paternity tests, and the results are positive,” she does\n\nnot plead that she obtained this information before Weismiller was fired in October 2009 or even\n\nbefore she filed this lawsuit.2 Id., ¶ 22.\n\n              Former Chancellor Rhee certainly had no actual knowledge of Weismiller’s sexual\n\nrelationship with Plaintiff at any time before the filing of this lawsuit, let alone prior to\n\nWeismiller’s termination from DCPS. Nothing in the Second Amended Complaint suggests\n\nRhee would have had any reason to know of the relationship while it was ongoing – i.e., in April\n\n2009 or earlier. The best Plaintiff can argue based on the facts that she pled is that school\n\nofficials knew or should have known of the relationship, a level of knowledge clearly insufficient\n\nto satisfy the demanding Gebser standard. See 524 U.S. at 285 (imposing liability based on\n\nschool district’s constructive knowledge of discrimination would “frustrate the purposes” of Title\n\nIX); see also Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118290\"><a href=\"/opinion/118290/davis-v-monroe-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (1999) (The court in Gebser “declined the invitation to impose liability under what\n\namounted to a negligence standard – holding the district liable for its failure to react to teacher-\n\nstudent harassment of which it knew or should have known. Rather, we concluded that the\n\ndistrict could be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally acted in clear\n\nviolation of Title IX.”) (emphasis in original). Similarly, in Baynard, the Fourth Circuit found\n\nthat Malone, a school principal who had received multiple reports that a particular teacher had in\n\n\n                                                            \n              2\n            Plaintiff does state in her Opposition that Weismiller took this paternity test in “late August 2010.” Opp.\nat 2. While the Court will not consider facts appearing for the first time in Plaintiff’s Opposition brief, were it to do\nso, the timing of the paternity test would further cut against Plaintiff’s argument that the District had actual\nknowledge of her sexual relationship with Weismiller 1) at the time it was occurring, 2) at the time DCPS conducted\nits investigation, or 3) prior to Weismiller’s termination.\n\n                                                               24\n \n\fthe past abused a student and was reported to be inappropriately touching a current student, did\n\nnot have actual knowledge of the abuse. Id., 268 F.3d at 238. The Fourth Circuit found:\n\n“Although Malone certainly should have been aware of the potential for such abuse, and for this\n\nreason was properly held liable under § 1983, there is no evidence in the record to support a\n\nconclusion that Malone was in fact aware that a student was being abused.” Id. (emphasis in\n\noriginal). These facts are thus insufficient under Gebser to establish that anyone within DCPS\n\nhad actual knowledge of Weismiller’s sexual relationship with Plaintiff.\n\n       Even if the Court could infer that someone had actual knowledge, Plaintiff has not pled\n\nthat an “appropriate person” did. Indeed, she does not even identify in her Second Amended\n\nComplaint anyone within DCPS whom she alleges is an “appropriate person” for Title IX\n\npurposes. In her Opposition, she argues that “two teachers and numerous staff members\n\nsuspected Weismiller’s sexual misconduct” and cites T.Z. v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1885939\"><a href=\"/opinion/1885939/tz-ex-rel-cg-v-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (E.D.N.Y. 2009), for the proposition that a teacher can be an “appropriate person”\n\nunder Title IX. Opp. at 26-27. The Court is not persuaded. Even if this suspicion could equate\n\nwith actual knowledge, which it cannot, Plaintiff still fails the “appropriate person” test.\n\n       Gebser makes clear that the “appropriate person” must be “an official who at a minimum\n\nhas authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the\n\nrecipient's behalf.” 524 U.S. at 290. Plaintiff does not allege in her Second Amended Complaint\n\nthat these teachers and staff members had the authority to take corrective action against\n\nWeismiller and does not explain in her Opposition why or how she believes this to be the case.\n\nPlaintiff’s citation to T.Z. does not support her cause. While this Court is free to disagree with\n\nT.Z., the facts of that case can also be distinguished from those here. In T.Z., a group of students\n\nsexually assaulted another student during class. See 634 F. Supp. 2d at 266. The court described\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n \n\fRaskin, the classroom teacher, as “a school official with the authority to intervene.” Id. at 269.\n\nThis Court does not opine on whether this type of “authority to intervene” is sufficient to\n\nestablish Title IX liability in peer-to-peer sexual harassment cases.\n\n       The Court agrees, however, with the Courts of Appeals of other Circuits that have\n\ndecided that, in the context of student-teacher sexual harassment, the “authority to take\n\ncorrective action” means the ability to fire or discipline the teacher in question. See Baynard,\n\n268 F.3d at 238-39; Rosa H., 106 F.3d at 660. Addressing the question of whether a school\n\nprincipal was an appropriate person under Title IX, under Virginia law, the Fourth Circuit found:\n\n“[N]o rational jury could find that [the principal] was invested with the power to take corrective\n\naction on behalf of the [school board]. . . . [W]hether a supervisory employee may be viewed as\n\nthe proxy of the school district depends upon whether the district has delegated to that employee\n\nthe traditional powers of an employer, e.g., the authority to hire and terminate employees.”\n\nBaynard, 268 F.3d at 238-39. The Fifth Circuit has identified the relevant persons as “those\n\nschool employees in the chain of command whom the school board has appointed to monitor the\n\nconduct of other employees and, as distinguished from reporting to others, remedy the\n\nwrongdoing themselves.” Rosa H., 106 F.3d at 660. These interpretations are consistent with\n\nthe purpose stated in Gebser – that a federal funding recipient not be subject to liability under\n\nTitle IX without notice of the discriminatory conduct and the opportunity to take remedial action.\n\nId. at 285-86, 290. The teachers and staff members Plaintiff points to in her Opposition are not\n\nsuch persons.\n\n       Independently, Plaintiff’s Title IX claim cannot survive because, even if she had\n\nadequately alleged that an appropriate person within DCPS had actual knowledge of her sexual\n\nrelationship with Weismiller, she has not pled sufficient facts to support her position that the\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n \n\fDistrict responded with deliberate indifference. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 95. A school district is\n\nnot deliberately indifferent to reports of sexual harassment of a student unless its “response was\n\n‘clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.’” Power ex rel. Power v. Gilbert\n\nPublic Schools, No. 10-15149, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4898079</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (9th Cir. Oct. 14, 2011) (quoting Davis,\n\n526 U.S. at 648). In Power, the Ninth Circuit found the school district’s response not\n\nunreasonable where the evidence showed that school “officials timely and thoroughly\n\ninvestigated and responded to each” of the plaintiffs’ complaints. Id.\n\n       Plaintiff has not pled facts that would allow the Court to draw a reasonable inference that\n\nDCPS’s response in this case was unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. See J.M. ex\n\nrel. Morris v. Hilldale Independent School District No. 1-29, 397 Fed. Appx. 445, at *7 (10th\n\nCir. 2010) (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 649) (“The Supreme Court . . . has made clear that ‘[i]n an\n\nappropriate case, there is no reason why courts, on a motion to dismiss, . . . could not identify a\n\nresponse as not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law.’”). As Plaintiff has pled, “[A]fter\n\nlearning that [she] was pregnant” in May 2009, “DCPS initiate[d] an investigation into the sexual\n\nrelationship between Weismiller and Plaintiff.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 29. At least six teachers and\n\nstaff members at Shadd were interviewed, including Weismiller and one teacher who had\n\nattempted to investigate rumors of a sexual relationship by entering Weismiller’s classroom\n\nduring the lunch hour. Id., ¶¶ 30-37. According to Plaintiff, at the close of the investigation,\n\nRhee “said the statements by teachers and staff did not offer definitive proof of a sexual\n\nrelationship” and “characterized the situation as ‘a he said, she said.’” Id., ¶ 39. Ultimately,\n\nDCPS “found Weismiller not liable for ‘grave misconduct in office’ and not liable for ‘other\n\nfailure of good behavior during duty hours which is of such a nature that it causes discredit to the\n\nemployee’s agency or employment.’” Id., ¶ 38. In light of the breadth of this investigation and\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n \n\fits inconclusive results, DCPS can hardly be said to have acted with deliberate indifference by\n\nnot firing Weismiller then. Finally but significantly, Plaintiff “does not allege that further sexual\n\nharassment occurred as a result of [DCPS’s] deliberate indifference.” Escue v. Northern OK\n\nCollege, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167633\"><a href=\"/opinion/167633/escue-v-n-oklahoma-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1155 (10th Cir. 2006). The Supreme Court has stated that “the\n\ndeliberate indifference must, at a minimum, cause students to undergo harassment or make them\n\nliable or vulnerable to it.” Davis, 536 U.S. at 645, quoted in Escue, 450 F.3d at 1155.\n\n       Given an appropriate person’s lack of actual knowledge of Plaintiff’s sexual relationship\n\nwith Weismiller, the extent of the investigation the District conducted, and the fact that the\n\nrelationship had ended before DCPS began its investigation, the Court finds as a matter of law\n\nthat Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead her Title IX claim.\n\n       C.      State Claims\n\n       Having prevailed on Plaintiff’s federal claims, the District next argues that Plaintiff’s\n\ncommon law causes of action against it “should be dismissed for failure to provide proper notice\n\nof her claims” under D.C. Code § 12-309. See Mot. at 24. Plaintiff’s common law claims\n\nagainst the District include negligent supervision, negligent hiring and retention, intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n       Section 12-309 of the D.C. Code states:\n\n            An action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia for\n            unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six months after\n            the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney\n            has given notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of Columbia of the\n            approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or\n            damage. A report in writing by the Metropolitan Police Department, in\n            the regular course of duty, is a sufficient notice under this section.\n\nCompliance with this notice requirement is a mandatory prerequisite for everyone with a tort\n\nclaim against the District of Columbia. See Blocker-Burnette v. District of Columbia, 730 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 200, 203 (D.D.C. 2010); District of Columbia v. Dunmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1473442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1473442/district-of-columbia-v-dunmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1359 (D.C.\n                                                 28\n \n\f1995). Because filing suit against the District of Columbia represents a waiver of the District’s\n\nsovereign immunity, “section 12-309 is to be construed narrowly against claimants.” Dunmore,\n\n662 A.2d at 1359; see also Blocker-Burnette, 730 F. Supp. 2d at 203 (“Courts should strictly\n\nconstrue Section 12-309’s notice requirements.” (quoting Day v. District of Columbia Dep’t of\n\nConsumer & Regulatory Affairs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454233\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454233/day-v-dc-dept-of-consumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (D.D.C. 2002)).\n\n       Nowhere in her Second Amended Complaint does Plaintiff allege that she submitted\n\nwritten notice of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or damages\n\ndirectly to the Mayor of the District of Columbia. Instead, she alleges that “[t]he District of\n\nColumbia received notice of the circumstances giving rise to the claims herein, as required by\n\nD.C. Code § 12-309, pursuant to an investigative report completed by DCPS’s Division of\n\nSchool Security on August 21, 2009” (DCPS Report) and “in a May 13, 2010 letter.” See Sec.\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 12. Plaintiff alleges that the investigation resulting in the DCPS Report\n\ncommenced in May 2009. Id., ¶ 29. In her Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the DCPS Report\n\n“was circulated to DCPS’ legal department, among other school officials,” and “that Shadd\n\nPrincipal Alonzo Randall, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, and the\n\nUnited State’s [sic] Attorney’s Office were all told about the investigation.” Opp. at 7. Plaintiff\n\nhas not alleged that she, her agent, or her attorney sent the DCPS Report to the Mayor, or that the\n\nMetropolitan Police Department issued a written report in response to being told about the\n\ninvestigation.\n\n       Plaintiff cites Allen v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1262 (D.C. 1987), for the\n\nproposition that “written notice by a claimant should not be a prerequisite to legal action if, in\n\nfact, actual notice in the form of a police report has been received by the District,” and suggests\n\nthat the DCPS Report is analogous to a police report in this respect. Opp. at 6-7. The Court\n\n\n                                                 29\n \n\fdisagrees. As courts in this District have previously held, “Only two types of notice can satisfy\n\nthe requirements of Section 12-309[]: (1) a written notice to the Mayor of the District of\n\nColumbia, or (2) a police report prepared in the regular course of duty.” Blocker-Burnette, 730\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 204 (citing Brown v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2340800\"><a href=\"/opinion/2340800/brown-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (D.D.C.\n\n2003)). Courts have thus previously found that neither complaints made to District of Columbia\n\nagencies other than the Mayor’s office nor reports of investigations prepared by agencies other\n\nthan the Metropolitan Police Department qualify as notice under § 12-309. See Blocker-\n\nBurnette, 730 F. Supp. 2d at 204 (“Because the notice requirement must be strictly construed . . .\n\nthe Court cannot conclude that plaintiff’s filing with the [District of Columbia Office of Human\n\nRights] substituted for written notice to the Mayor.”); Brown v. District of Columbia, 251 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 152, 165 (D.D.C. 2003) (finding plaintiff failed to comply with § 12-309 and granting\n\nsummary judgment where plaintiff sent letter to MPD Chief, D.C. Corporation Counsel, Police\n\nand Fire Clinic, and attorney in United States Attorney’s Office, but not to the Mayor, and did\n\nnot file a police report). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has concluded that the\n\n“statutory exception [in § 12-309] to formal notice [to the Mayor] is limited to police reports.”\n\nCampbell v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1078 (D.C. 1990) (citing Jenkins v. District of\n\nColumbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178 (D.C. 1977) (finding Fire Department report not equivalent to\n\npolice report for purposes of § 12-309)). In the only case cited by the parties addressing the\n\nquestion of whether a DCPS Division of School Security investigative report provides the\n\nrequisite notice under § 12-309, a court found that it did not. See Whittaker v. District of\n\nColumbia, No. 01-1403, 2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 27801, at *16-21 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\n       Plaintiff identifies two additional written documents that she alleges put the District of\n\nColumbia on actual notice of her claims – an April 13, 2010, email from Plaintiff’s counsel to\n\n\n\n                                                30\n \n\fDistrict of Columbia Attorney General Peter Nickles, and a May 13, 2010, letter from Plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel to the District of Columbia Office of Risk Management. See Opp. at 7, 9. Plaintiff\n\nmentions the April 13 email for the first time in her Opposition, and she pleads in her Second\n\nAmended Complaint nothing about the May 13 letter beyond the fact that she “gave the District\n\nof Columbia notice of this lawsuit” therein. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 12. She does not allege that\n\neither of these documents was sent to the Mayor. Even if the Court could consider these\n\nadditional facts, it is undisputed that both of these documents were sent more than six months\n\nafter Plaintiff’s alleged injury or damage was sustained.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff’s reliance on Hurd v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. 1954),\n\nand Rieser v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349523\"><a href=\"/opinion/349523/raymond-c-rieser-administrator-for-the-estate-and-personal-representative/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1977), does not alter the outcome.\n\nIn Hurd, the plaintiff did provide notice, via a letter to the District of Columbia commissioners,\n\nunder § 12-309. The sufficiency of the notice was at issue because the plaintiff had incorrectly\n\nlisted the address of the building outside of which she had fallen. See 106 A.2d at 704-05.\n\nBased on the description of the location, coupled with the erroneous address, however, the court\n\nfound that there was “no doubt that the District could have located the place of injury,” and that\n\nthe “statutory purpose” of § 12-309 had been satisfied. Id. at 704. In Rieser, the plaintiff had a\n\npolice report – the acceptable alternative to a notice to the mayor – and the question was again\n\none of sufficiency. See 563 F.2d at 476. The District complained that “it was not afforded\n\nnotice of the causal connection between the injury and any negligent acts of its agents, and that it\n\nwas entitled to but did not receive timely notice of Rieser’s intention to bring suit.” Id. Finding\n\nthat this additional information was not required by the statute, the court found Rieser’s notice to\n\nthe District sufficient. Id. Unlike the present case, the question in both Hurd and Rieser was not\n\nwhether those plaintiffs had complied with § 12-309 at all, but whether they had done so\n\n\n\n                                                31\n \n\fsufficiently. Plaintiff cannot claim to have done so at all. For this reason, Plaintiff’s common\n\nlaw claims against the District must be dismissed.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons articulated herein, an Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion\n\nwill grant the District Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.\n\n                                                     /s/ James E.
