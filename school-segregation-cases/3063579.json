In 2011,\n                appellant Dr. Joel Slade received a letter from a representative of\n                Harrah's Tunica notifying him that he had been evicted from that casino\n                and that the eviction would be enforced at all Caesars-owned, -operated, or\n                -managed properties. Dr. Slade was interested in attending a medical\n                conference that was to take place at Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, a\n                property owned and operated by Caesars. Dr. Slade contacted Caesars'\n                corporate headquarters in Nevada about attending the conference but was\n                informed that his eviction from Caesars' properties would be enforced at\n                Paris LV.\n                            Dr. Slade then filed a complaint, alleging a breach of the duty\n                of public access and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Dr. Slade\n                does not challenge the casino's right to exclude for proper cause Instead,\n                Dr. Slade alleged that under the common law and NRS 463.0129(1)(e),\n                Caesars could not exclude him without cause.' He further argued that the\n                casino owed him a duty of reasonable access either as a purveyor of a\n                public amusement or as an innkeeper. Caesars then filed a motion to\n                dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could\n\n                      lit is unclear from the record or the briefs on appeal the reason\n                Caesars evicted Dr. Slade from its properties.

When a statute's language is unambiguous, this court does\n                not resort to the rules of construction and will give that language its plain\n                meaning. Id. \"A statute must be construed as to 'give meaning to all of\n                [its] parts and language, and this court will read each sentence, phrase,\n                and word to render it meaningful within the context of the purpose of the\n                legislation.\" Id.

Pursuant to NRS 463.0129(1)(e), \"all gaming\n                establishments in this state must remain open to the general public and\n                the access of the general public to gaming activities must not be restricted\n                in any manner except as provided by the Legislature.\" However, the\n                statute also provides that \"[t]his section does not ... [abrogate or abridge\n                any common-law right of a gaming establishment to exclude any person\n                from gaming activities or eject any person from the premises of the\n\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                      3\n(0) (947A\n\f                establishment for any reason,\" NRS 463.0129(3)(a). 2 \"Gaming' ... means\n                to deal, operate, carry on, conduct, maintain or expose for play any\n                game or to operate an inter-casino linked system.\" NRS 463.0153.\n                \"Establishment' means any premises wherein or whereon any gaming is\n                done.\" NRS 463.0148.\n                           Whether NRS 463.0129(3)(a) permits gaming establishments\n                to exclude any person for any reason pursuant to common-law principles is\n                an issue of first impression in Nevada. 3 Dr. Slade argues that the\n                Legislature has codified a common-law duty to provide reasonable access\n                to the patrons of gaming establishments in NRS 463.0129(1)(e). In\n\n\n\n                      2 Nevada's legislative history regarding NRS 463.0129(3) is sparse,\n                with no discussion about how the Legislature viewed the common law or\n                why it used the term \"any common-law right\" in subsection 3. It does\n                appear that one reason the language was added to the statute in 1991 was\n                to ensure that gaming establishments in Nevada maintained the right to\n                evict card counters. See Hearing on S.B. 532 Before the Senate Comm. on\n                Judiciary, 66th Leg. (Nev., June 28, 1991) (remarks by Senator Bill\n                O'Donnell questioning whether \"section 3b of the [statute's] amendment\n                meant the management of a casino could ask a patron to leave if the\n                management suspected card counting\"); Hearing on S.B. 532 Before the\n                Senate Comm. on Judiciary, 66th Leg. (Nev., June 29, 1991) (explaining\n                that the amendment would allow gaming establishments to \"evict\n                cheaters\").\n\n                      3 Caesars  argues that this court has previously decided whether a\n                person may be excluded from the premises of a casino for any reason. See\n                S.O.C., Inc. v. Mirage Casino-Hotel, 117 Nev. 403, 411-14, 23 P.3d 243,\n                248-50 (2001); Spilotro v. State, ex rel. Nev. Gaming Comm'n, 99 Nev. 187,\n                189, 661 P.2d 467, 468 (1983). However, these cases involved an alleged\n                constitutional right to access, not a common-law right, and in both cases\n                we held that the reason for the exclusion was not discriminatory and\n                therefore valid, making them inapplicable here. S.O.C., 117 Nev. at 413-\n                14, 23 P.3d at 249-50; Spilotro, 99 Nev. at 194, 661 P.2d 467 at 471-72.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n     OF\n   NEVADA\n                                                    4\n10) 1947A •\n\f                making his argument, Dr. Slade urges this court to read NRS\n                463.0129(1)(e) as requiring Caesars to provide him access to its Nevada\n                establishments because he is a member of the general public. Caesars\n                counters that NRS 463.0129(3)(a) preserves the common-law right to\n                exclude any individual for any otherwise lawful, nondiscriminatory\n                reason. The parties' arguments suggest that NRS 463.0129 presents\n                competing rights to the general public and gaming establishments\n                concerning access to a casino's premises. Therefore, we must first\n                interpret the language in these statutory subsections and determine the\n                common-law rule before reaching the merits of this appeal.\n                Construction of NRS 463.0129\n                            The plain language of NRS 463.0129(1)(e) assures access to\n                the general public to a gaming premises, except as provided by the\n                Legislature. But the Legislature appears to have qualified that access by\n                recognizing a common-law right of gaming establishments in NRS\n                463.0129(3)(a) to eject any person from the premises In harmonizing\n                NRS 463.0129(1)(e) and 3(a), we must determine the breadth of an owner's\n                common-law right to evict patrons.\n                            There is overwhelming authority recognizing the common-law\n                right of a private owner of a public amusement to exclude any person for\n                any reason from the premises. See, e.g., Brooks v. Chicago Downs Ass'n,\n                Inc., 791 F.2d 512, 513, 516 (7th Cir. 1986) (\"find[ing] that Illinois follows\n                the common law rule\" in detei mining that a race track operator had the\n                absolute right to exclude a patron for any reason); Ziskis v. Kowalski, 726\n                F. Supp. 902, 908 (D. Conn. 1989) (\"The weight of the case law upholds the\n                common law rule that owners of places of amusement, like theaters and\n                racetracks, are permitted to exclude patrons without cause.\"); Donovan v.\n                Grand Victoria Casino & Resort, L.P., 934 N.E.2d 1111, 1112, 1115-16\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                      5\n(0) 1947A\n\f                (Ind. 2010) (following the majority rule in holding that the owner of a\n                riverboat casino had a common-law right to exclude any person from its\n                premises). 4\n                               A narrower interpretation of the common-law rule to exclude\n                persons stems from the Supreme Court of New Jersey's decision in Uston\n                v. Resorts International Hotel, Inc., 445 A.2d 370 (N.J. 1982). In Uston, a\n                casino banned a card counter from its premises based on his method of\n                playing blackjack.     Id. at 371. The court held that the exclusion was\n                invalid because the controlling gaming authority \"alone has the authority\n\n\n                      4 Dr. Slade argues that, pursuant to NRS 1.030, Nevada should not\n                recognize the current majority position because the common law to be\n                applied to innkeepers is that of England as it existed in either 1776, at the\n                establishment of the Union, or in 1864 when Nevada became a state. We\n                do not agree with his contention for three reasons. We first note that NRS\n                463.0129(3)(a) specifically provides that the common law to be applied is\n                that which allows a gaming establishment to \"eject any person from the\n                premises of the establishment for any reason.\" Moreover, Dr. Slade does\n                not cite to, and this court has not identified, any early cases determining a\n                gaming establishment's common-law right to exclude. Additionally, the\n                early common law does not appear to apply a uniform rule. Some early\n                common-law cases did not allow a private owner of a public amusement to\n                exclude any person for any reason, see, e.g., Donnell v. State, 48 Miss. 661,\n                681 (1873), while other cases did allow such exclusions, see, e.g., Madden\n                v. Queens Cty. Jockey Club, Inc., 72 N.E.2d 697, 698 (N.Y. 1947) (\"At\n                common law a person engaged in a public calling, such as innkeeper or\n                common carrier, was held to be under a duty to the general public and was\n                obliged to serve, without discrimination, all who sought service. . . . On the\n                other hand, proprietors of private enterprises, such as places of\n                amusement and resort, were under no such obligation, enjoying an\n                absolute power to serve whom they pleased.\"). Finally, this court has\n                previously determined that, \"[d]espite NRS 1.030, courts may reject the\n                common law where it is not applicable to local conditions.\" Rupert v.\n                Stienne, 90 Nev. 397, 399, 528 P.2d 1013, 1014 (1974).

The court went on to conclude that the common-law\n                  right to exclude in New Jersey was \"substantially limited by a competing\n                  common law right of reasonable access to public places.\" Id.\n                              We decline to follow the more narrow position that a common-\n                  law right of reasonable access to public places limits a private owner's\n                  right to exclude because its restrictive articulation of the common law is\n                  inconsistent with the plain language of NRS 463.0129(3)(a). Thus, in\n                  harmonizing NRS 463.0129(1)(e) and NRS 463.0129(3)(a), we conclude\n                  that casino establishments are to be open to the general public but have\n                  the common-law right to exclude any individual from the premises\n                  pursuant to the majority common-law position.\n                              We emphasize, however, the right to exclude is not without\n                  significant and important limitation. We further conclude that NRS\n                  463.0129(3)(a) does not grant gaming establishments an unlimited right to\n                  exclude anyone for any reason as that common-law right can be abridged\n                  by other statutory provisions. For example, under NRS 651.070, \"Earn\n                  persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\n                  facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of any place of\n                  public accommodation, [5] without discrimination or segregation on the\n                  ground of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual\n\n\n\n\n                        5NRS 651.050(3)(a), (b), and (d) define \"'[p]lace of public\n                  accommodation\" as \"[a]ny inn, hotel, motel or other establishment which\n                  provides lodging to transient guests,\" as well as restaurants, bars, and\n                  theaters. Because casinos combine several of the elements, we conclude\n                  that casinos are 'place [s] of public accommodation.'\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                        7\n(0) 1947A    ea\n\f                   orientation, sex, gender identity or expression.\" 6 (Emphasis added.) This\n                   interpretation of a gaming establishment's right to exclude is consistent\n                   with other jurisdictions that recognize the majority common-law position.\n                   See, e.g., Brooks, 791 F.2d at 513 (\"[T]he operator of a horse race track has\n                   the absolute right to exclude a patron from the track premises for any\n                   reason, or no reason, except race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\");\n                   Ziskis, 726 F. Supp. at 905 (recognizing that the common-law rule was\n                   limited by a state law that \"deals with public accommodations, including\n                   places of amusement, creat[ing] . . . a right not to be discriminated against\n                   on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin\"); Madden, 72 N.E.2d\n                   at 698 (\"The common-law power of exclusion. . . continues until changed\n                   by legislative enactment.

Accordingly, we conclude that while\n                   gaming establishments generally have the right to exclude any person, the\n                   reason for exclusion must not be discriminatory or otherwise unlawful.\n                   We now turn our attention to whether Dr. Slade's exclusion was for an\n                   unlawful reason.\n\n\n\n\n                         °In addition, the statutes governing Nevada's gaming industry are\n                   encompassed in NRS Chapter 463. NRS 463.151 regulates the \"exclusion\n                   or ejection of certain persons from licensed establishments.\" Pursuant to\n                   NRS 463.151(3)(a) and (c), the State Gaming Control Board has the\n                   authority to determine who may be excluded and may consider, among\n                   other things, whether the person has a \"[p1-nor conviction of a crime\" or a\n                       otorious or unsavory reputation which would adversely affect public\n                   confidence and trust that the gaming industry is free from criminal or\n                   corruptive elements.\"\n\nSUPREME COURT\n      OF\n    NEVADA\n                                                         8\n(0) 1947A 444WIP\n\f                Dr. Slade failed to demonstrate that his exclusion was for an unlawful\n                reason\n                             This court reviews a district court's order granting a motion to\n                dismiss for failure to state a claim under \"a rigorous, de novo standard of\n                review.\"   Pack v.

A complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim \"only\n                if it appears beyond a doubt that [the plaintiff] could prove no set of facts,\n                which, if true, would entitle [the plaintiff] to relief.\"   Buzz Stew, LLC v.\n                City of N. Las Vegas, 124 Nev. 224, 228, 181 P.3d 670, 672 (2008).\n                             Although it is unclear from the record why Caesars initially\n                evicted Dr. Slade from its property in Mississippi and this question was\n                not argued or considered below, it does appear that his exclusion from\n                Caesars' Las Vegas properties was based on that prior eviction. Dr. Slade\n                does not argue on appeal, nor did he litigate at district court, that he was\n                excluded from Caesars' properties for an unlawful reason. In his\n                complaint, Dr. Slade simply argued that he never acted \"disorderly\" on a\n                Caesars property or \"cause [d] injury to any company affiliated with\n                Caesars\" and alleged a breach of the duty of public access and sought\n                declaratory and injunctive relief. Dr. Slade did not ask for discovery on\n                the reason for his exclusion, which he undoubtedly would have been\n                entitled to. Because Dr. Slade failed to demonstrate that his exclusion\n                from Caesars' properties was for unlawful reasons, we conclude \"beyond a\n                doubt that [he] could prove no set of facts, which, if true, would entitle\n                [him] to relief.\" Id.\n                Innkeeper common law is not implicated here\n                             One of our dissenting colleagues opines, and Dr. Slade\n                advances a similar argument on appeal, that gaming establishments,\n                when acting as innkeepers, have a common-law duty to allow access to any\nSUPREME COURT\n         OF\n      NEVADA\n                                                       9\n(0) 1947P,\n\f                 patron seeking lodging if there is not cause to exclude. We respectfully\n                 disagree. We do not believe that the Legislature intended that gaming\n                 establishments be subject to varying common-law duties. The plain\n                 meaning of the statutory definition for gaming establishment encompasses\n                 the entirety of the \"premises wherein or whereon any gaming is done.\"\n                 NRS 463.0148; NRS 463.0153; see also Premises, Black's Law Dictionary\n                 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"premises\" as a \"building, along with its\n                 grounds\"). Arbitrarily limiting a gaming establishment's premises to the\n                 nonhotel portions contradicts NRS 463.0148's plain meaning.\n                                 Further, the rule suggested by our colleague would result in\n                 district courts parsing out parts of a gaming establishment's premises to\n                 determine whether patrons may be excluded without cause or whether a\n                 reason for exclusion must be given. Such an inquiry would create an\n                 inconsistent application of the statutes because of the many ways a\n                 gaming establishment can be configured and the variety of reasons guests\n                 patronize hotel-casinos.\n                                 Moreover, NRS 463.0129(3)(a) specifically provides that the\n                 common-law right to exclude \"any person from the premises of fa gaming]\n                 establishment for any reason\" is not abridged. Had the Legislature\n                 intended that an innkeeper common-law rule be weighed against the right\n                 to exclude any person for any reason, in the context of gaming\n                 establishments, it would have provided as much in NRS 463.0129(3).

This is not a difficult test to pass, and Slade's\n                   allegations that Caesars, as an innkeeper and convention host, violated\n                   the common law when it excluded him for no stated reason from all parts\n                   of all of its properties more than meet the mark.

While the common law did\n                \"not confer[ ] any right of access to places of public amusement,\" it held\n                that innkeepers, by virtue of the dependency their establishment induced\n                in members of the traveling public, could not refuse service without good\n                reason.

Originally, innkeepers had a duty to serve guests absent good\n                cause to exclude because inns were so far and few between that travelers\n                found themselves at the mercy of the innkeeper and were vulnerable to\n                extortion from the innkeeper. See Bruce Wyman, The Law of the Public\n                Callings as a Solution of the Trust Problem, 17 Harv. L. Rev. 156, 159\n                (1904).

See, e.g., Brooks v. Chi.\n                    Downs Ass'n, Inc., 791 F.2d 512, 516-17 (7th Cir. 1986); Madden, 72\n                    N.E.2d at 698. But these cases did not involve properties like Caesars\n                    that have gaming and, in addition, offer vast convention and hotel space.\n                    From a common-law perspective, hotel-casino-convention-centers\n                    implicate both the innkeeper rule and the rule regarding places of public\n                    amusement, a distinction the majority rejects. Yet, it is a fact that hotel-\n                    casinos offer many amenities beyond gambling: hotel rooms, convention\n                    centers, shopping malls, restaurants, swimming pools, wedding halls,\n                    concert halls, nightclubs, bowling alleys, zoos, spas, and more. Neither\n                    this court nor any other has endorsed the proposition that the mere\n                    presence of a casino exempts a hotel/convention center from the common-\n                    law rule of inclusivity applicable to innkeepers.

However, the Legislature did not simply state that rule, as\n                       the majority seems to believe. Rather, the Legislature incorporated and\n                       preserved the common law in NRS 463.0129(3)(a), which requires a legal\n                       analysis into the common-law rights and duties of innkeepers versus\n                       places of public amusements. 2\n\n\n\n\n                             2 The majority is construing NRS 463.0129(3)(a) as altering the\n                       common-law duties of innkeepers by applying the right to exclude for\n                       public amusements to the entire premises of a hotel-casino.

As Las\n                   Vegas continues to market itself as a convention-center destination, a\n                   policy that would allow a hotel-casino to become the exclusive venue for\n                   conventions, yet retain unfettered discretion to exclude persons who want\n                   to attend those conventions, invokes the same concerns that drove the\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                        7\n(0) 1907A    At,\n\f                 innkeeper common law—a theory based on the monopolistic nature of the\n                 inn.\n                             The majority incorrectly interprets the monopolistic nature of\n                 convention centers, arguing that \"practically every large gaming\n                 establishment has sizeable meeting areas, resulting in fierce competition,\n                 [which] in no way implicates the concerns expressed in the original\n                 innkeeper common-law rule.\" This interpretation fails to address the\n                 exclusivity of a particular convention. While venue-shopping, a business\n                 wishing to host a convention has many options, but once that business\n                 selects a particular venue, it becomes the exclusive venue for that\n                 convention. As is the case here, the medical convention Slade wished to\n                 attend was hosted by a Caesars property. After being excluded, Slade\n                 could not attend the same convention at another location because that\n                 particular Caesars' property was the exclusive venue for the convention.\n                 Thus, the concept of a virtual monopoly is arguably as present, if not more,\n                 for conventions than for innkeepers. But even assuming the public\n                 amusement rule, not the innkeeper rule, applies to the pure convention-\n                 goer, it is not possible to draw this much from the record below at this\n                 stage of the case, where, on the face of the pleadings, Slade alleges that he\n                 was invoking the common-law right not to be excluded by an innkeeper\n                 from the inn.\n                             The majority correctly observes that, under NRS 651.070,\n                 Caesars cannot illegally discriminate against Slade or other prospective\n                 patrons on the basis of race or other protected status. But this statutory\n                 prohibition requires the excluded patron to plead and prove the illegal\n                 discrimination. The common law, by contrast, requires the innkeeper to\n                 give a reason for the exclusion, rather than rest on the right to exclude for\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                       8\n(01 1947A    e\n\f                any reason, or no given reason at all. The difference is meaningful, as the\n                common law recognized.\n                            The record in this case is wholly undeveloped. We do not\n                know, for example, why Caesars sent Slade the letter it did, or whether\n                Slade could attend the medical convention without walking across the\n                casino floor. Without more than the bare allegations in Slade's complaint,\n                though, I cannot reconcile an absolute right to exclude for any reason or no\n                reason at all to the entire premises of a hotel-casino with the common-law\n                duty of innkeepers, which only allows exclusion for good cause. Thus, I\n                would reverse the district court's dismissal of Slade's complaint and\n                remand for further proceedings.\n                            I dissent.\n\n\n                                                      1                            J.\n                                                   Pickering\n\n                I concur:\n\n\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n     OF\n   NEVADA\n                                                     9\n(01 194Th e\n\f                CHERRY, J., dissenting:\n                            I join in the dissent authored by Justice Pickering, but I write\n                separately because I cannot support the majority's conclusion that a\n                plaintiff bears the responsibility of proving, prior to conducting discovery,\n                that a gaming and entertainment corporation has chosen to discriminate\n                against him for an unlawful reason.'\n                            The majority correctly commences with the plain language\n                of the statute. NRS 463.0129(3)(a) certainly permits \"a gaming\n                establishment to exclude any person from gaming activities or eject any\n                person from the premises of the establishment for any reason.\" The\n                majority's opinion today, if not narrowly read, could be interpreted to say\n                that a casino can exclude any person for any reason or for no reason at all,\n                which is contrary to Nevada law.\n                            This distinction is important here because in its majority\n                opinion today, this court has precluded Dr. Slade from ascertaining why\n                Caesars Entertainment excluded him from its properties. The reason for\n\n\n\n\n                      'This matter came before the district court as an NRCP 12(b)(5)\n                motion to dismiss. Given the procedural posture of the case, the court\n                below was obligated to accept as true everything in the complaint as it\n                existed at that time and draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\n                Stubbs v. Strickland, 129 Nev., Adv. Op. 15, 297 P.3d 326, 328-29 (2013).\n                It does not appear that such consideration was given to appellant.\n                Granting dismissal with nothing more than the complaint was error.\n                Allowing some discovery on this issue might have provided significant\n                information to appellant.\n\nSUPREME COLMT\n        OF\n      NEVADA\n\n\n(0)   ,0A\n\f                Dr. Slade's exclusion is crucial. Although the statute allows Caesars to\n                exclude him for any reason, NRS 651.070 prevents \"any place of public\n                accommodation\" from discriminating \"on the ground of race, color,\n                religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity\n                or expression.\"\n                            This case is not the first time that this court or the United\n                States Supreme Court has held that a right to exclude for any reason is\n                not without its limits. In the arena of jury selection, for example, although\n                an attorney may exercise any number of peremptory challenges to excuse\n                a juror without cause, it is a long-standing principle that an attorney may\n                not do so on the basis of race or gender. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79,\n                89 (1986); J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 130-31 (1994). More recently,\n                the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit extended this\n                principle to exclusions on the basis of sexual orientation.        SmithKline\n                Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471, 486 (9th Cir. 2014). In the\n                aftermath of these cases, if a party alleges a violation, then that party is\n                not required to prove it; rather, the burden shifts to the other party to\n                proffer a nondiscriminatory reason for the dismissal.\n                             The principles of Batson, J.E.B., and SmithKline are no\n                different here, which is why the Legislature enacted MRS 651.070. I do\n                not believe Nevada law allows (or that the Nevada Legislature ever\n                intended) for Caesars Entertainment, or any other gaming establishment,\n                to engage in potentially unlawful discrimination simply because it chooses\n\n\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n          OF\n      NEVADA\n                                                       2\n(0) 1947,1)\n\f                    not to give a reason for its actions. 2 For these reasons, I would allow this\n                    case to proceed to discovery. 3 Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                          2 Nothing   in this dissent should be read as an accusation that\n                    Caesars Entertainment actually engaged in unlawful discrimination. The\n                    point is that without discovery, we cannot be sure.\n\n                          3 Thebetter practice would have been for the court sua sponte to\n                    require respondents to file a more definite statement rather than grant\n                    dismissal outright.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n       OF\n    NEVADA\n\n                                                           3\n(0) I947A .4&:94)\n\f",

In 2011,\n                appellant Dr. Joel Slade received a letter from a representative of\n                Harrah's Tunica notifying him that he had been evicted from that casino\n                and that the eviction would be enforced at all Caesars-owned, -operated, or\n                -managed properties. Dr. Slade was interested in attending a medical\n                conference that was to take place at Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, a\n                property owned and operated by Caesars. Dr. Slade contacted Caesars'\n                corporate headquarters in Nevada about attending the conference but was\n                informed that his eviction from Caesars' properties would be enforced at\n                Paris LV.\n                            Dr. Slade then filed a complaint, alleging a breach of the duty\n                of public access and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Dr. Slade\n                does not challenge the casino's right to exclude for proper cause Instead,\n                Dr. Slade alleged that under the common law and NRS 463.0129(1)(e),\n                Caesars could not exclude him without cause.' He further argued that the\n                casino owed him a duty of reasonable access either as a purveyor of a\n                public amusement or as an innkeeper. Caesars then filed a motion to\n                dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could\n\n                      lit is unclear from the record or the briefs on appeal the reason\n                Caesars evicted Dr. Slade from its properties.

It does\n                appear that one reason the language was added to the statute in 1991 was\n                to ensure that gaming establishments in Nevada maintained the right to\n                evict card counters.

Caesars\n                counters that NRS 463.0129(3)(a) preserves the common-law right to\n                exclude any individual for any otherwise lawful, nondiscriminatory\n                reason. The parties' arguments suggest that NRS 463.0129 presents\n                competing rights to the general public and gaming establishments\n                concerning access to a casino's premises. Therefore, we must first\n                interpret the language in these statutory subsections and determine the\n                common-law rule before reaching the merits of this appeal.\n                Construction of NRS 463.0129\n                            The plain language of NRS 463.0129(1)(e) assures access to\n                the general public to a gaming premises, except as provided by the\n                Legislature. But the Legislature appears to have qualified that access by\n                recognizing a common-law right of gaming establishments in NRS\n                463.0129(3)(a) to eject any person from the premises In harmonizing\n                NRS 463.0129(1)(e) and 3(a), we must determine the breadth of an owner's\n                common-law right to evict patrons.\n                            There is overwhelming authority recognizing the common-law\n                right of a private owner of a public amusement to exclude any person for\n                any reason from the premises.

The court held that the exclusion was\n                invalid because the controlling gaming authority \"alone has the authority\n\n\n                      4 Dr. Slade argues that, pursuant to NRS 1.030, Nevada should not\n                recognize the current majority position because the common law to be\n                applied to innkeepers is that of England as it existed in either 1776, at the\n                establishment of the Union, or in 1864 when Nevada became a state. We\n                do not agree with his contention for three reasons. We first note that NRS\n                463.0129(3)(a) specifically provides that the common law to be applied is\n                that which allows a gaming establishment to \"eject any person from the\n                premises of the establishment for any reason.\" Moreover, Dr. Slade does\n                not cite to, and this court has not identified, any early cases determining a\n                gaming establishment's common-law right to exclude. Additionally, the\n                early common law does not appear to apply a uniform rule. Some early\n                common-law cases did not allow a private owner of a public amusement to\n                exclude any person for any reason, see, e.g., Donnell v.

Accordingly, we\n                are not persuaded by the argument.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n       OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                      6\n(0) 1947A w\n\f                  to exclude patrons based upon their strategies for playing licensed casino\n                  games.\" Id. at 372. The court went on to conclude that the common-law\n                  right to exclude in New Jersey was \"substantially limited by a competing\n                  common law right of reasonable access to public places.\" Id.\n                              We decline to follow the more narrow position that a common-\n                  law right of reasonable access to public places limits a private owner's\n                  right to exclude because its restrictive articulation of the common law is\n                  inconsistent with the plain language of NRS 463.0129(3)(a). Thus, in\n                  harmonizing NRS 463.0129(1)(e) and NRS 463.0129(3)(a), we conclude\n                  that casino establishments are to be open to the general public but have\n                  the common-law right to exclude any individual from the premises\n                  pursuant to the majority common-law position.\n                              We emphasize, however, the right to exclude is not without\n                  significant and important limitation. We further conclude that NRS\n                  463.0129(3)(a) does not grant gaming establishments an unlimited right to\n                  exclude anyone for any reason as that common-law right can be abridged\n                  by other statutory provisions. For example, under NRS 651.070, \"Earn\n                  persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\n                  facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of any place of\n                  public accommodation, [5] without discrimination or segregation on the\n                  ground of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual\n\n\n\n\n                        5NRS 651.050(3)(a), (b), and (d) define \"'[p]lace of public\n                  accommodation\" as \"[a]ny inn, hotel, motel or other establishment which\n                  provides lodging to transient guests,\" as well as restaurants, bars, and\n                  theaters. Because casinos combine several of the elements, we conclude\n                  that casinos are 'place [s] of public accommodation.'\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                        7\n(0) 1947A    ea\n\f                   orientation, sex, gender identity or expression.\" 6 (Emphasis added.) This\n                   interpretation of a gaming establishment's right to exclude is consistent\n                   with other jurisdictions that recognize the majority common-law position.\n                   See, e.g., Brooks, 791 F.2d at 513 (\"[T]he operator of a horse race track has\n                   the absolute right to exclude a patron from the track premises for any\n                   reason, or no reason, except race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\");\n                   Ziskis, 726 F.

Accordingly, we conclude that while\n                   gaming establishments generally have the right to exclude any person, the\n                   reason for exclusion must not be discriminatory or otherwise unlawful.\n                   We now turn our attention to whether Dr. Slade's exclusion was for an\n                   unlawful reason.\n\n\n\n\n                         °In addition, the statutes governing Nevada's gaming industry are\n                   encompassed in NRS Chapter 463.

Dr. Slade\n                does not argue on appeal, nor did he litigate at district court, that he was\n                excluded from Caesars' properties for an unlawful reason. In his\n                complaint, Dr. Slade simply argued that he never acted \"disorderly\" on a\n                Caesars property or \"cause [d] injury to any company affiliated with\n                Caesars\" and alleged a breach of the duty of public access and sought\n                declaratory and injunctive relief. Dr. Slade did not ask for discovery on\n                the reason for his exclusion, which he undoubtedly would have been\n                entitled to.

We respectfully\n                 disagree. We do not believe that the Legislature intended that gaming\n                 establishments be subject to varying common-law duties. The plain\n                 meaning of the statutory definition for gaming establishment encompasses\n                 the entirety of the \"premises wherein or whereon any gaming is done.\"\n                 NRS 463.0148; NRS 463.0153; see also Premises, Black's Law Dictionary\n                 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"premises\" as a \"building, along with its\n                 grounds\"). Arbitrarily limiting a gaming establishment's premises to the\n                 nonhotel portions contradicts NRS 463.0148's plain meaning.\n                                 Further, the rule suggested by our colleague would result in\n                 district courts parsing out parts of a gaming establishment's premises to\n                 determine whether patrons may be excluded without cause or whether a\n                 reason for exclusion must be given. Such an inquiry would create an\n                 inconsistent application of the statutes because of the many ways a\n                 gaming establishment can be configured and the variety of reasons guests\n                 patronize hotel-casinos.\n                                 Moreover, NRS 463.0129(3)(a) specifically provides that the\n                 common-law right to exclude \"any person from the premises of fa gaming]\n                 establishment for any reason\" is not abridged. Had the Legislature\n                 intended that an innkeeper common-law rule be weighed against the right\n                 to exclude any person for any reason, in the context of gaming\n                 establishments, it would have provided as much in NRS 463.0129(3).

While the common law did\n                \"not confer[ ] any right of access to places of public amusement,\" it held\n                that innkeepers, by virtue of the dependency their establishment induced\n                in members of the traveling public, could not refuse service without good\n                reason.

Originally, innkeepers had a duty to serve guests absent good\n                cause to exclude because inns were so far and few between that travelers\n                found themselves at the mercy of the innkeeper and were vulnerable to\n                extortion from the innkeeper.

However, the Legislature did not simply state that rule, as\n                       the majority seems to believe. Rather, the Legislature incorporated and\n                       preserved the common law in NRS 463.0129(3)(a), which requires a legal\n                       analysis into the common-law rights and duties of innkeepers versus\n                       places of public amusements. 2\n\n\n\n\n                             2 The majority is construing NRS 463.0129(3)(a) as altering the\n                       common-law duties of innkeepers by applying the right to exclude for\n                       public amusements to the entire premises of a hotel-casino.

As Las\n                   Vegas continues to market itself as a convention-center destination, a\n                   policy that would allow a hotel-casino to become the exclusive venue for\n                   conventions, yet retain unfettered discretion to exclude persons who want\n                   to attend those conventions, invokes the same concerns that drove the\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                        7\n(0) 1907A    At,\n\f                 innkeeper common law—a theory based on the monopolistic nature of the\n                 inn.\n                             The majority incorrectly interprets the monopolistic nature of\n                 convention centers, arguing that \"practically every large gaming\n                 establishment has sizeable meeting areas, resulting in fierce competition,\n                 [which] in no way implicates the concerns expressed in the original\n                 innkeeper common-law rule.\" This interpretation fails to address the\n                 exclusivity of a particular convention. While venue-shopping, a business\n                 wishing to host a convention has many options, but once that business\n                 selects a particular venue, it becomes the exclusive venue for that\n                 convention. As is the case here, the medical convention Slade wished to\n                 attend was hosted by a Caesars property. After being excluded, Slade\n                 could not attend the same convention at another location because that\n                 particular Caesars' property was the exclusive venue for the convention.\n                 Thus, the concept of a virtual monopoly is arguably as present, if not more,\n                 for conventions than for innkeepers. But even assuming the public\n                 amusement rule, not the innkeeper rule, applies to the pure convention-\n                 goer, it is not possible to draw this much from the record below at this\n                 stage of the case, where, on the face of the pleadings, Slade alleges that he\n                 was invoking the common-law right not to be excluded by an innkeeper\n                 from the inn.\n                             The majority correctly observes that, under NRS 651.070,\n                 Caesars cannot illegally discriminate against Slade or other prospective\n                 patrons on the basis of race or other protected status. But this statutory\n                 prohibition requires the excluded patron to plead and prove the illegal\n                 discrimination. The common law, by contrast, requires the innkeeper to\n                 give a reason for the exclusion, rather than rest on the right to exclude for\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                       8\n(01 1947A    e\n\f                any reason, or no given reason at all. The difference is meaningful, as the\n                common law recognized.\n                            The record in this case is wholly undeveloped. We do not\n                know, for example, why Caesars sent Slade the letter it did, or whether\n                Slade could attend the medical convention without walking across the\n                casino floor. Without more than the bare allegations in Slade's complaint,\n                though, I cannot reconcile an absolute right to exclude for any reason or no\n                reason at all to the entire premises of a hotel-casino with the common-law\n                duty of innkeepers, which only allows exclusion for good cause.

NRS 463.0129(3)(a) certainly permits \"a gaming\n                establishment to exclude any person from gaming activities or eject any\n                person from the premises of the establishment for any reason.\" The\n                majority's opinion today, if not narrowly read, could be interpreted to say\n                that a casino can exclude any person for any reason or for no reason at all,\n                which is contrary to Nevada law.\n                            This distinction is important here because in its majority\n                opinion today, this court has precluded Dr. Slade from ascertaining why\n                Caesars Entertainment excluded him from its properties.

Although the statute allows Caesars to\n                exclude him for any reason, NRS 651.070 prevents \"any place of public\n                accommodation\" from discriminating \"on the ground of race, color,\n                religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity\n                or expression.\"\n                            This case is not the first time that this court or the United\n                States Supreme Court has held that a right to exclude for any reason is\n                not without its limits. In the arena of jury selection, for example, although\n                an attorney may exercise any number of peremptory challenges to excuse\n                a juror without cause, it is a long-standing principle that an attorney may\n                not do so on the basis of race or gender.
