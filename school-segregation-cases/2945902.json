See TEX.\n\nLAB. CODE ANN. §§ 21.051, 21.055 (West 2006). SISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction,\n\nasserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because Molina failed to exhaust her\n\fadministrative remedies pursuant to the Texas Education Code. See TEX. EDUC. CODE\n\nANN. § 21.207 (West Supp. 2011), § 21.209 (West 2006). The trial court initially granted\n\nSISD’s plea to the jurisdiction. However, after a hearing, the trial court granted Molina’s\n\nmotion for new trial, effectively denying SISD’s plea to the jurisdiction. We hold that\n\nMolina was not required to exhaust her remedies under the education code and\n\ntherefore affirm the trial court’s order.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Molina was employed as an assistant principal at SISD. In the spring of 2011,\n\nshe was notified that her contract would not be renewed because of a reduction in force.\n\nMolina filed a charge of discrimination alleging retaliation and discrimination on the\n\nbasis of her disability. After she received a right-to-sue letter from the Texas Workforce\n\nCommission—Civil Rights Division (TWC), she filed suit against SISD, alleging\n\nretaliation and discrimination on the basis of her disability under the labor code. See\n\nTEX. LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 21.051, 21.055. It is undisputed that Molina did not pursue a\n\nhearing with SISD’s Board of Trustees or an appeal with the Commissioner of\n\nEducation.\n\n       SISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that the trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction over the suit because Molina failed to exhaust her administrative remedies\n\nunder the Term Contract Nonrenewal Act. See TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 21.201–.213\n\n(West 2006 & Supp. 2011). The trial court’s order granting Molina’s motion for new trial\n\neffectively denied SISD’s plea to the jurisdiction. This interlocutory appeal followed.\n\nSee TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014 (a)(8) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f                      II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\n   A. Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n       A plea questioning the trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction raises a question of\n\nlaw that we review de novo. See Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\n217, 226 (Tex. 2004). We focus first on the pleadings to determine whether the facts\n\npled affirmatively demonstrate that subject-matter jurisdiction exists. Id. We construe\n\nthe pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff and look to the pleader’s intent. Id. A plea\n\nshould not be granted if a fact issue is presented as to the court’s jurisdiction, but if the\n\npleadings affirmatively demonstrate an incurable jurisdictional defect, then the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction must be granted. Id. at 227–28. If the pleadings are insufficient to\n\nestablish jurisdiction but do not affirmatively demonstrate an incurable defect, the\n\nplaintiff should be afforded the opportunity to replead. Id. at 226–27. In performing its\n\nreview, an appellate court does not look to the merits of the case but considers only the\n\npleadings and evidence relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry. Id. at 227.\n\n   B. Texas Labor Code\n\n       Chapter 21 of the labor code, which is also known as the Commission on Human\n\nRights Act (CHRA), prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age.    TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.051.         Specifically,\n\nsection 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n              An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because\n       of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n                  discriminates in any other manner against an individual in\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                  connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or\n                  privileges of employment; or\n\n              (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n                  employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive\n                  an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect\n                  in any other manner the status of an employee.\n\nId. The CHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who: “(1) opposes a discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3)\n\nfiles a complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an\n\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing.” Id. § 21.055.\n\n       It is well settled that before suing under chapter 21, the complainant must\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies. See City of Waco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147,\n\n154–55 (Tex. 2008); Hoffmann–La Roche, Inc. v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 446\n\n(Tex. 2004). To exhaust administrative remedies under chapter 21 of the labor code, a\n\nplaintiff must:   (1) file a complaint with the TWC within 180 days of the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory practice; (2) permit the TWC to dismiss the complaint or resolve it within\n\n180 days before filing suit; and (3) file suit no later than two years after the complaint is\n\nfiled. TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.201–.202, .208, .256 (West 2006); Rice v. Russell–\n\nStanley, L.P., 131 S.W.3d 510, 513 (Tex. App.—Waco 2004, pet. denied).                  The\n\nplaintiff's administrative remedies are exhausted by her entitlement to a right-to-sue\n\nletter, which simultaneously ends the exclusive jurisdiction of the TWC.          Rice, 131\n\nS.W.3d at 513. It is undisputed that Molina exhausted her administrative remedies\n\nunder the labor code.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f    C. Term Contract Nonrenewal Act (TCNA)\n\n        The TCNA, found in chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code, provides an\n\nadministrative procedure that allows a person employed by a school district under a\n\nterm contract to seek judicial review of a district's decision not to renew the contract.\n\nSee TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 21.207–.209; Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Griego, 170\n\nS.W.3d 792, 794–95 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, pet. denied). The TCNA requires an\n\nemployee who is aggrieved by the nonrenewal of a term contract to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies before seeking redress in the courts. See TEX. EDUC. CODE\n\nANN. § 21.209; Brown v. Amarillo Indep. Sch. Dist., 190 S.W.3d 7, 10 (Tex. App.—\n\nAmarillo 2005, no pet.). It is undisputed that Molina did not exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies under the TCNA.\n\n                                     III. DISCUSSION\n\n        By a single issue, SISD contends the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\n\njurisdiction because Molina failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the\n\nTCNA before filing suit. SISD argues that, because part of Molina’s claim is that her\n\ncontract was not renewed, she was required to exhaust her administrative remedies\n\nunder the TCNA, and her failure to do so deprives the trial court of jurisdiction. Molina\n\nresponds that she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies under the\n\nTCNA because she pursued claims of retaliation and discrimination based on her\n\ndisability under the labor code.     Molina argues that because she exhausted her\n\nadministrative remedies under the labor code, the trial court had jurisdiction over her\n\nsuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      Molina relies on Vela v. Waco Independent School District, 69 S.W.3d 695, 702\n\n(Tex. App.—Waco 2002, pet. withdrawn) and Port Arthur Independent School District v.\n\nEdwards, No. 09-11-628-CV, 2012 WL 489052 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Feb. 16, 2012,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.), in support of her argument. In Vela, the plaintiff sued the Waco\n\nIndependent School District (WISD) alleging that it discriminated against her on the\n\nbasis of ethnicity and sex when she was reassigned from her position as an elementary\n\nschool principal to a position in WISD’s central office. 69 S.W.3d at 697. As in the\n\npresent case, Vela filed a discrimination complaint and exhausted her administrative\n\nremedies under the labor code.     See id.       WISD argued that Vela was required to\n\nexhaust her remedies under both the labor code and the education code. See id. As\n\nnoted in Austin Independent School District v. Lowery, the Waco court:\n\n      explicitly rejected the dual-exhaustion requirement, holding that it was\n      unnecessary for a school district employee “to pursue two administrative\n      schemes, one under the [labor code] and the other under the Education\n      Code, before seeking relief in the courts.” The holding in Vela was\n      predicated on the court's determinations that (1) unlike the education\n      code, the [labor code] contains specific statutes that address\n      discrimination by an employer; and (2) a school district employee's\n      discrimination claim under the [labor code] does not pertain to the\n      administration of school laws. Id. at 701.\n\n212 S.W.3d 827, 832 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied), disapproved on other\n\ngrounds by Rusk State Hosp. v. Black, 392 S.W.3d 88 (Tex. 2012) (citations omitted);\n\nsee Larsen v. Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist., 296 S.W.3d 118, 130 n.12 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (noting that the Vela court “held that the\n\n[CHRA’s] provisions requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies described in the\n\nstatute itself trumped the Education Code and made it unnecessary for the plaintiff to\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fexhaust the school district’s remedies; thus, the [CHRA] requires only exhaustion of the\n\nadministrative remedies outlined within the Act itself”).\n\n       In Edwards, the Port Arthur Independent School District (PAISD) transferred the\n\nplaintiff (Edwards) from a position as a principal to an administrative position. 2012 WL\n\n489052, at *1.     After exhausting her administrative remedies under the labor code,\n\nEdwards filed suit alleging discrimination and retaliation. Id. As in the present case,\n\nPAISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction alleging that Edwards’s suit was barred because\n\nshe had not exhausted her administrative remedies under the education code. See id.\n\nRelying, in part, on the reasoning in Vela and the supreme court’s ruling in City of Waco\n\nv. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 151, 155 (Tex. 2008),1 the Edwards court found that, “it is\n\nthe Legislature’s intent that work-related discrimination claims that fall within the purview\n\nof the CHRA be subject only to the administrative remedies in the [CHRA].”                      See\n\nEdwards, 2012 WL 489052 at *5 (citing Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 702). The Edwards court\n\nlooked to Edwards’s pleadings, noting that she had alleged that her transfer was in\n\nretaliation for her opposition to PAISD’s discriminatory practices, and that she had not\n\nasserted a claim for breach of contract. See id. The court held that Edwards was not\n\nrequired to exhaust her administrative remedies under the education code before filing\n\nher suit. See id. at *6.\n\n       We next turn to examine Molina’s pleadings. Molina’s pleadings state that she is\n\nonly pursuing claims under the labor code and is not pursuing claims under the\n\neducation code. She asserts that she has a disability, “a form of cerebral palsy which\n\n\n\n       1\n         In Lopez, the Texas Supreme Court held that the CHRA provided the exclusive state statutory\nremedy for claims of discrimination and retaliation. City of Waco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 156 (Tex.\n2008).\n\n                                                 7\n\faffects major life activities such as walking, balancing, working and lifting.”                  Molina\n\nalleges that SISD discriminated against her on the basis of her disability by:\n\n        having her office secluded away from the principal when no one else is,\n        being harassed for not signing documents requiring [her] to be physically\n        doing things made very difficult by her disability, being passed up for\n        interviews, using different tools to evaluate her, being relieved of important\n        assistant principal duties, being informed that she would not be affected\n        by the reduction in force (RIF) plan and in fact was, failure to promote and\n        being the only administrator who was terminated.\n\nShe also claims that SISD retaliated against her because she raised the issue of\n\ndiscrimination against her.\n\n        We recognize that the plaintiffs in Vela and Edwards were transferred or\n\nreassigned by their respective employers. See Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 697; Edwards, 2012\n\nWL 489052, at *1. Because their employers did not fail to renew their contracts, the\n\nTCNA was not applicable. See Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 697; Edwards, 2012 WL 489052, at\n\n*1. Rather, in each case, the school district relied on section 7.057 of the education\n\ncode or its predecessor and argued that the plaintiff was required to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies.        See TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 7.057 (West Supp. 2011).2\n\nClaimants under both the TCNA and section 7.057 of the education code are required to\n\nexhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit. See Larsen, 296 S.W.3d at 128\n\n(“Texas courts hold that contractual school district employees must exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies found in the Education Code pursuant to either section 7.057\n\n(a)(2)(B) or the Term Contract Nonrenewal Act.”).                 Accordingly, we do not see a\n\n\n\n\n        2\n            Section 7.057 of the education code grants the Commissioner of Education exclusive\njurisdiction over claims involving the “school laws of this state,” and over actions or decisions of any\nschool district board that violate “the school laws of this state” or any provision of a written contract\nbetween the school district and its employee. See TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 7.057 (West Supp. 2011).\n\n                                                   8\n\fsignificant distinction between the facts in Vela and Edwards and the present case and\n\nconclude that the reasoning in those cases is dispositive of the issue in this appeal.\n\n       SISD cites Nairn v. Killeen Independent School District, 366 S.W.3d 229, 248\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2012, no pet.), Griego, 170 S.W.3d at 797, and Brown, 190\n\nS.W.3d at 10, in support of its position. None of these cases, however, involve plaintiffs\n\nwho asserted claims under the labor code and exhausted their administrative remedies\n\nunder the labor code. Accordingly, we find them to be distinguishable.\n\n       Construing Molina’s pleadings liberally in her favor and looking to her intent, as\n\nwe must, see Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226, we conclude that Molina exhausted her\n\nadministrative remedies under the labor code and, following the Waco and Beaumont\n\ncourts, we conclude that she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies\n\nunder the education code. See Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 702 (“[W]e conclude that the intent\n\nof the CHRA is for Vela’s claim to be subject only to those administrative remedies in\n\nthe CHRA itself.”); Edwards, 2012 WL 489052, at *6 (holding that Edwards was not\n\nrequired to exhaust remedies under the education code before filing suit).\n\n                                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       We overrule SISD’s sole issue in this interlocutory appeal and affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s order.\n\n                                                 DORI CONTRERAS GARZA,\n                                                 Justice\n\n\n\n\nDelivered and filed the\n19th day of September, 2013.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f",

This interlocutory appeal followed.\n\nSee TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014 (a)(8) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f                      II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\n   A. Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n       A plea questioning the trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction raises a question of\n\nlaw that we review de novo. See Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894512\"><a href=\"/opinion/894512/texas-dept-parks-and-wildlife-v-miranda/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (Tex. 2004). We focus first on the pleadings to determine whether the facts\n\npled affirmatively demonstrate that subject-matter jurisdiction exists. Id. We construe\n\nthe pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff and look to the pleader’s intent. Id. A plea\n\nshould not be granted if a fact issue is presented as to the court’s jurisdiction, but if the\n\npleadings affirmatively demonstrate an incurable jurisdictional defect, then the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction must be granted. Id. at 227–28. If the pleadings are insufficient to\n\nestablish jurisdiction but do not affirmatively demonstrate an incurable defect, the\n\nplaintiff should be afforded the opportunity to replead. Id. at 226–27. In performing its\n\nreview, an appellate court does not look to the merits of the case but considers only the\n\npleadings and evidence relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry. Id. at 227.\n\n   B. Texas Labor Code\n\n       Chapter 21 of the labor code, which is also known as the Commission on Human\n\nRights Act (CHRA), prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age.    TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.051.         Specifically,\n\nsection 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n              An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because\n       of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n                  discriminates in any other manner against an individual in\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                  connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or\n                  privileges of employment; or\n\n              (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n                  employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive\n                  an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect\n                  in any other manner the status of an employee.\n\nId. The CHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who: “(1) opposes a discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3)\n\nfiles a complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an\n\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing.” Id. § 21.055.\n\n       It is well settled that before suing under chapter 21, the complainant must\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies.

Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895021\"><a href=\"/opinion/895021/city-of-waco-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n154–55 (Tex. 2008); Hoffmann–La Roche, Inc. v.

Rice, 131\n\nS.W.3d at 513. It is undisputed that Molina exhausted her administrative remedies\n\nunder the labor code.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f    C. Term Contract Nonrenewal Act (TCNA)\n\n        The TCNA, found in chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code, provides an\n\nadministrative procedure that allows a person employed by a school district under a\n\nterm contract to seek judicial review of a district's decision not to renew the contract.\n\nSee TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 21.207–.209; Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Griego, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2352687\"><a href=\"/opinion/2352687/ysleta-independent-school-dist-v-griego/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794–95 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, pet. denied). The TCNA requires an\n\nemployee who is aggrieved by the nonrenewal of a term contract to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies before seeking redress in the courts. See TEX. EDUC. CODE\n\nANN. § 21.209; Brown v. Amarillo Indep. Sch.

App.—\n\nAmarillo 2005, no pet.). It is undisputed that Molina did not exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies under the TCNA.\n\n                                     III. DISCUSSION\n\n        By a single issue, SISD contends the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\n\njurisdiction because Molina failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the\n\nTCNA before filing suit. SISD argues that, because part of Molina’s claim is that her\n\ncontract was not renewed, she was required to exhaust her administrative remedies\n\nunder the TCNA, and her failure to do so deprives the trial court of jurisdiction. Molina\n\nresponds that she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies under the\n\nTCNA because she pursued claims of retaliation and discrimination based on her\n\ndisability under the labor code.     Molina argues that because she exhausted her\n\nadministrative remedies under the labor code, the trial court had jurisdiction over her\n\nsuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      Molina relies on Vela v.

As in the\n\npresent case, Vela filed a discrimination complaint and exhausted her administrative\n\nremedies under the labor code.     See id.       WISD argued that Vela was required to\n\nexhaust her remedies under both the labor code and the education code. See id. As\n\nnoted in Austin Independent School District v.
