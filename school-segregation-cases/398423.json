The   issues     assume       added     importance      because   the\n\ninformation sought concerns targeted killings of United States\n\ncitizens carried out by drone aircraft.                    Plaintiffs-Appellants\n\nThe New York Times Company and New York Times reporters Charlie\n\nSavage and Scott Shane (sometimes collectively “N.Y. Times”), and\n\nthe   American   Civil   Liberties          Union    and    the   American    Civil\n\nLiberties Union Foundation (collectively “ACLU”) appeal from the\n\nJanuary 24, 2013, judgment of the United States District Court\n\nfor the Southern District of New York (Colleen McMahon, District\n\nJudge)   dismissing,     on   motions        for     summary      judgment,   their\n\nconsolidated FOIA suits. See New York Times Co. v. U. S. Dep’t\n\nof Justice (“Dist. Ct. Op.”), 915 F. Supp. 2d 508 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2013).   The suits were brought against the Defendants-Appellees\n\nUnited States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the United States\n\nDepartment of Defense (“DOD”), and the Central Intelligence\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fAgency (“CIA”) (sometimes collectively the “Government”).\n\n       We emphasize at the outset that the Plaintiffs’ lawsuits do\n\nnot    challenge   the    lawfulness       of    drone    attacks    or    targeted\n\nkillings.      Instead,    they    seek     information       concerning      those\n\nattacks, notably, documents prepared by DOJ’s Office of Legal\n\nCounsel (“OLC”) setting forth the Government’s reasoning as to\n\nthe lawfulness of the attacks.\n\n       The issues primarily concern the validity of FOIA responses\n\nthat (a) decline to reveal even the existence of any documents\n\nresponsive to particular requests (so-called “Glomar responses”\n\n(described below)), (b) acknowledge the existence of responsive\n\ndocuments but decline to reveal either the number or description\n\nof such documents (so-called “no number, no-list” responses\n\n(described     below)),    (c)    assert        various    FOIA     exemptions   or\n\nprivileges claimed to prohibit disclosure of various documents\n\nthat    have   been   publicly     identified,            notably    the    OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum and other OLC legal opinions, and (d) challenge the\n\nadequacy of a FOIA search conducted by one office of DOJ.\n\n       We conclude that (1) a redacted version of the OLC-DOD\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fMemorandum must be disclosed, (2) a redacted version of the\n\nclassified Vaughn index (described below) submitted by OLC must\n\nbe disclosed, (3) other legal opinions prepared by OLC must be\n\nsubmitted to the District Court for in camera inspection and\n\ndetermination of waiver of privileges and appropriate redaction,\n\n(4)   the   Glomar    and   “no     number,    no   list”   responses   are\n\ninsufficiently justified, (5) DOD and CIA must submit Vaughn\n\nindices to the District Court for in camera inspection and\n\ndetermination    of    appropriate        disclosure    and    appropriate\n\nredaction, and (6) the Office of Information Policy (“OIP”)\n\nsearch was sufficient.      We therefore affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand.\n\n                                  Background\n\n      The FOIA requests at issue in this case focus primarily on\n\nthe drone attacks in Yemen that killed Anwar al-Awlaki2 and Samir\n\nKhan in September 2011 and al-Awlaki’s teenage son, Abdulrahman\n\nal-Awlaki, in October 2011. All three victims were United States\n\n\n      2\n       This spelling, which we adopt (except in quotations), is used\nby the District Court and in the Government’s brief. The briefs of\nN.Y. Times and ACLU and numerous documents in the record render the\nname “al-Aulaqi.”\n\n                                      6\n\fcitizens either by birth or naturalization.\n\n    Statutory Framework. FOIA provides, with exceptions not\n\nrelevant to this case, that an “agency, upon any request for\n\nrecords which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is\n\nmade in accordance with published rules . . . , shall make the\n\nrecords   promptly   available       to   any   person.”   5   U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(3)(A) (2013).   FOIA contains several exemptions, three\n\nof which are asserted in this case.\n\n    Exemption 1 exempts records that are “(A) specifically\n\nauthorized under criteria established by an Executive order to\n\nbe kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign\n\npolicy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such\n\nExecutive order.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1) (2013).       Executive Order\n\n13526 allows an agency to withhold information that (1) “pertains\n\nto” one of the categories of information specified in the\n\nExecutive order, including “intelligence activities (including\n\ncovert action),” “intelligence sources or methods,” or “foreign\n\nrelations or foreign activities of the United States” and (2) if\n\n“unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fexpected to cause identifiable and describable damage to the\n\nnational security.”     Executive Order No. 13526 § 1.1(a)(3)-(4),\n\n1.4(c)-(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 708, 709 (Dec. 29, 2009).\n\n     Exemption 3 exempts records that are “specifically exempted\n\nfrom disclosure by [another] statute” if the relevant statute\n\neither “requires that the matters be withheld from the public in\n\nsuch a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue” or\n\n“establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to\n\nparticular   types    of    matters       to   be    withheld.”        5   U.S.C.\n\n§   552(b)(3)(A)(i),       (ii)   (2013).           Two   such    statutes      are\n\npotentially relevant here.        The Central Intelligence Agency Act\n\nof 1949, as amended, provides that the Director of National\n\nIntelligence “shall be responsible for protecting intelligence\n\nsources or methods,” and exempts CIA from “any other law which\n\nrequire[s] the publication or disclosure of the organization,\n\nfunctions,   names,    official    titles,      salaries,        or   numbers    of\n\npersonnel employed by the Agency.” 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (2013). The\n\nNational Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. § 3024-1(i)(1) (2013),\n\nexempts from disclosure “intelligence sources and methods.”\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\f    Exemption   5   exempts     “inter-agency   or   intra-agency\n\nmemorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\nparty other than an agency in litigation with the agency.” 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(5) (2013).    Exemption 5 encompasses traditional\n\ncommon law privileges against disclosure, including the attorney-\n\nclient and deliberative process privileges.          See National\n\nCouncil of La Raza v. Dep't of Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 356 (2d\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n    The N.Y. Times FOIA requests and Government responses.\n\nShane and Savage, New York Times reporters, submitted separate\n\nFOIA requests to OLC.   Shane’s request, submitted in June 2010,\n\nsought:\n\n    all Office of Legal Counsel opinions or memoranda since\n    2001 that address the legal status of targeted\n    killings, assassination, or killing of people suspected\n    of ties to Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups by\n    employees or contractors of the United States\n    government.\n\nJoint Appendix (“JA”) 296-97.\n\n    Savage’s request, submitted in October 2010, sought:\n\n    a copy of all Office of Legal Counsel memorandums\n    analyzing the circumstances under which it would be\n    lawful for United States armed forces or intelligence\n\n\n                                 9\n\f       community assets to target for killing a United States\n       citizen who is deemed to be a terrorist.\n\nJA 300-01.\n\n       OLC denied Shane’s request.          With respect to the portion of\n\nhis request that pertained to DOD, OLC initially submitted a so-\n\ncalled “no number, no list” response3 instead of submitting the\n\nusual Vaughn index,4 numbering and identifying by title and\n\ndescription documents that are being withheld and specifying the\n\nFOIA       exemptions    asserted.    A     no   number,    no   list   response\n\nacknowledges       the    existence   of    documents      responsive    to   the\n\nrequest, but neither numbers nor identifies them by title or\n\ndescription.       OLC said that the requested documents pertaining\n\nto DOD were being withheld pursuant to FOIA exemptions 1, 3, and\n\n5.\n\n       As to documents pertaining to agencies other than DOD, OLC\n\n\n\n       3\n       The term was apparently coined by CIA, see Bassiouni v. CIA, 392\nF.3d 244, 246 (7th Cir. 2004), and the CIA’s use of no number, no list\nresponses to FOIA requests has been considered by district courts in\nthe District of Columbia. See National Security Counselors v. CIA, 898\nF. Supp. 2d 233, 284-85 (D.D.C. 2012); Jarvik v. CIA, 741 F. Supp. 2d\n106, 123 (D.D.C. 2010).\n       4\n           The term derives from Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir.\n1973).\n\n                                       10\n\fsubmitted a so-called “Glomar response.”5      This type of response\n\nneither confirms nor denies the existence of documents responsive\n\nto the request. See Wilner v. National Security Agency, 592 F.3d\n\n60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009).    OLC stated that the Glomar response was\n\ngiven “because the very fact of the existence or nonexistence of\n\nsuch documents is itself classified, protected from disclosure\n\nby statute, and privileged” under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1), (3), (5).\n\nCIA confirmed that it requested DOJ to submit a Glomar response\n\non its behalf.6\n\n     OLC also denied Savage’s request.          Declining to submit\n\neither a Vaughn index or even a no number, no list response, OLC\n\nsubmitted a Glomar response, stating that, pursuant to Exemptions\n\n1, 3, and 5, it was neither confirming nor denying the existence\n\n\n     5\n       The term derives from the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a vessel built\nto recover a sunken Soviet submarine. See Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d\n1009, 1010-12 (D.C. Cir. 1976). A Glomar response was first used in\n1992 in a case challenging a Government agency’s refusal to confirm or\ndeny the existence of certain materials requested under FOIA, see\nBenavides v. DEA, 968 F.2d 1243, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n     6\n       CIA made one exception to its request that OLC submit a Glomar\nresponse. Because CIA’s involvement in the operation that resulted in\nthe death of Osama bin Laden had been acknowledged and was not\nclassified, the agency asserted that any OLC documents related to the\nagency’s involvement in that operation would not be covered by a\nGlomar response, but added that there were no such documents.\n\n                                  11\n\fof documents described in the request. Unlike its letter denying\n\nthe Shane request, OLC’s response to the Savage request did not\n\nidentify any responsive documents relating to DOD.\n\n      During the course of the            litigation, OLC modified its\n\nresponses to the Shane and Savage requests by identifying the\n\nexistence of one document pertaining to DOD, what the District\n\nCourt and the parties have referred to as the OLC-DOD Memorandum,\n\nbut claimed that this document was exempt from disclosure under\n\nExemption 5.      Because the OLC-DOD Memorandum was classified, it\n\nwas presumably also withheld under Exemption 1.             As to all other\n\nDOD documents, it is not clear whether OLC was continuing to\n\nassert a Glomar response, as it had made to Shane, or a no\n\nnumber, no list response, as it had made to Savage.\n\n      The ACLU FOIA requests and Government responses. In October\n\n2011,     ACLU   submitted   FOIA   requests   to   three   agencies:   DOJ\n\n(including two of DOJ’s component agencies, OIP and OLC), DOD,\n\nand     CIA.     The   requests,    quoted     in   the   margin,7   sought\n\n      7\n\n      1. All records created after September 11, 2001, pertaining\n      to the legal basis in domestic, foreign, and international\n      law upon which U.S. citizens can be subjected to targeted\n      killings, whether using unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs” or\n\n                                     12\n\f“drones) or by other means.\n\n2. All records created after September 11, 2001, pertaining\nto the process by which U.S. citizens can be designated for\ntargeted killings, including who is authorized to make such\ndeterminations and what evidence is needed to support them.\n\n3. All memoranda, opinions, drafts, correspondence, and\nother records produced by the OLC after September 11, 2001,\npertaining to the legal basis in domestic, foreign, and\ninternational law upon which the targeted killing of Anwar\nal-Awlaki was authorized and upon which he was killed,\nincluding discussions of:\n\n     A. The reasons why domestic-law prohibitions on murder,\n     assassination, and excessive use of force did not\n     preclude the targeted killing of al-Awlaki;\n\n     B. The protection and requirements imposed by the Fifth\n     Amendment Due Process Clause;\n\n     C. The reasons why International-law prohibitions on\n     extrajudicial killing did not preclude the targeted\n     killing of al-Awlaki;\n\n     D. The applicability (or non-applicability) of the\n     Treason Clause to the decision whether to target al-\n     Awlaki;\n\n     E. The legal basis authorizing the CIA, JSOC, or other\n     U.S. Government entities to carry out the targeted\n     killing of Anwar Al-Awlaki;\n\n     F. Any requirement for proving that al-Awlaki posed an\n     imminent risk of harm to others, including an\n     explanation of how to define imminence in this context;\n     and\n\n     G. Any requirement that the U.S. Government first\n     attempt to capture Al-Awlaki before killing him.\n\n                              13\n\f4. All documents and records pertaining to the factual basis\nfor the targeted killing of Al-Awlaki, including:\n\n     A. Facts supporting a belief that al-Awlaki posed an\n     imminent threat to the United States or United States\n     interests;\n\n     B. Facts supporting a belief that al-Awlaki could not\n     be captured or brought to justice using nonlethal\n     means;\n\n     C.   Facts  indicating    that   there   was  a   legal\n     justification for killings persons other than al-\n     Awlaki, including other U.S. citizens, while attempting\n     to kill al-Awlaki himself;\n\n     D. Facts supporting the assertion that al-Awlaki was\n     operationally involved in al Qaeda, rather than being\n     involved merely in propaganda activities; and\n\n     E. Any other facts relevant to the decision to\n     authorize and execute the targeted killings of al-\n     Awlaki.\n\n5. All documents and records pertaining to the factual basis\nfor the killing of Samir Khan, including whether he was\nintentionally targeted, whether U.S. Government personnel\nwere aware of his proximity to al-Awlaki at the time the\nmissiles were launched at al-Awlaki’s vehicle, whether the\nUnited States took measures to avoid Khan’s death, and any\nother facts relevant to the decision to kill Khan or the\nfailure to avoid causing his death.\n\n6. All documents and records pertaining to the factual basis\nfor the killing of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, including whether\nhe was intentionally targeted, whether U.S. Government\npersonnel were aware of his presence when they launched a\nmissile or missiles at his location, whether he was targeted\non the basis of his kinship with Anwar al-Awlaki, whether\nthe United States took measures to avoid his death, and any\n\n                             14\n\fvarious documents concerning the targeted killings of United\n\nStates citizens in general and al-Awlaki, his son, and Khan in\n\nparticular.\n\n    Both OLC and CIA initially submitted Glomar responses,\n\nrefusing     to   confirm   or   deny    the   existence   of   responsive\n\ndocuments, pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n    DOD initially stated that it could not respond to the\n\nrequest within the statutory time period because of the scope and\n\ncomplexity of the request.\n\n    During the course of the litigation, the Government agencies\n\nmodified their original responses in light of statements by\n\nsenior Executive Branch officials on the legal and policy issues\n\npertaining to United States counterterrorism operations and the\n\npotential use of lethal force by the United States Government\n\nagainst senior operational leaders of al-Qaeda who are United\n\nStates citizens.\n\n    OLC provided ACLU with a Vaughn index of sixty unclassified\n\n\n     other factors relevant to the decision to kill him or the\n     failure to avoid causing his death.\n\nJA 252-53.\n\n                                    15\n\fresponsive     documents,   each    described     as    an    e-mail    chain\n\nreflecting internal deliberations concerning the legal basis for\n\nthe use of lethal force against United States citizens in a\n\nforeign country in certain circumstances.              OLC withheld these\n\ndocuments pursuant to Exemption 5.\n\n    OLC also submitted a no number, no list response as to\n\nclassified documents, stating that it could not provide the\n\nnumber or description of these documents because that information\n\nwas protected from disclosure by Exemptions 1 and 3.                OLC did\n\ndescribe one of these documents as an “OLC opinion related to DoD\n\noperations,”     Declaration   of   John   E.   Bies,    Deputy   Assistant\n\nAttorney General, OLC ¶ 38 (“Bies Decl.”), JA 279, which it\n\nwithheld in its entirety under Exemptions 1 and 3.                  This is\n\napparently not the OLC-DOD Memorandum, which OLC said was exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under Exemption 5. That this document is not the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum is confirmed by OLC’s assertion that this\n\ndocument “cannot be further identified or described on the public\n\nrecord.”   Id.      The   OLC-DOD   Memorandum     was       withheld   under\n\nExemptions 1 and 5.\n\n    OIP located one responsive document, a set of talking points\n\n                                    16\n\fprepared   for      the   Attorney   General   and    others   related    to\n\n“hypothetical       questions    about    Anwar      al-Aulaqi’s   death,”\n\nDeclaration of Douglas R. Hibbard, Deputy Chief of the Initial\n\nRequest Staff, OIP ¶ 8, JA 441, which it released to ACLU.               OIP\n\nalso issued a Vaughn index listing four unclassified records\n\nwithheld under Exemptions 3, 5, and 6.8           OIP also submitted a no\n\nnumber, no list response to various classified documents withheld\n\nunder Exemptions 1 and 3.\n\n     DOD’s revised response disclosed a speech given by Jeh\n\nJohnson, then-DOD General Counsel, at Yale Law School on February\n\n22, 2012. DOD also provided ACLU with a Vaughn index listing ten\n\nunclassified records, withheld pursuant to Exemption 5.              Seven\n\nof those documents were e-mail traffic regarding drafts of the\n\nspeech given by Johnson at Yale Law School and a speech delivered\n\nby Attorney General Holder at Northwestern University School of\n\nLaw. One of the withheld unclassified records was a presentation\n\nby   Johnson   in    February   2012,     regarding    international     law\n\n\n     8\n       Exemption 6, which is not in issue in this appeal, applies to\n“personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which\nwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (2013).\n\n                                     17\n\fprinciples, to officers who had recently obtained the rank of O-\n\n7.    The   remaining   two   withheld   unclassified   records   were\n\ndescribed as “memoranda from the Legal Counsel to the Chairman\n\nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the White House’s National\n\nSecurity Council Legal Advisor addressing the legal basis for\n\nconducting military operations against U.S. citizens in general.”\n\nDeclaration of Robert E. Neller, Lt. General, United States\n\nMarine Corp, Director of Operations for the Joint Staff at the\n\nPentagon, ¶ 16 (“Neller Decl.”). JA 334.\n\n     DOD also located responsive classified records.          One of\n\nthese was the previously mentioned OLC-DOD memorandum, which DOD\n\nwithheld under Exemptions 1 and 5.       As to the other classified\n\ndocuments, DOD submitted a no number, no list response.\n\n     CIA modified its initial Glomar responses in June 2012 by\n\nconfirming the existence of “responsive records reflecting a\n\ngeneral interest” in two areas described in the ACLU’s request:\n\n(1) “‘the legal basis . . . upon which U.S. citizens can be\n\nsubjected to targeted killing’” and (2) “‘the process by which\n\nU.S. citizens can be subjected to targeted killing.’” Declaration\n\n\n\n                                  18\n\fof John Bennett, Director, National Clandestine Service, CIA,\n\n¶ 27 (quoting ACLU request).               In these two categories, CIA\n\nsubmitted a no number, no list response, relying on Exemptions\n\n1 and 3, with the exception that CIA acknowledged that it\n\npossessed copies of speeches given by the Attorney General at\n\nNorthwestern University Law School on March 5, 2012, and by the\n\nAssistant     to    the   President        for   Homeland       Security    and\n\nCounterterrorism on April 30, 2012. See id.\n\n    The     pending   lawsuit   and    District     Court   opinions.        In\n\nDecember 2011, N.Y. Times filed a lawsuit challenging the denials\n\nof the Shane and Savage requests.                ACLU filed its suit in\n\nFebruary    2012.     After     the   suits      were   consolidated,      both\n\nPlaintiffs and the Government filed cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment.     In January 2013, the District Court denied both\n\nPlaintiffs’    motions    for    summary      judgment    and    granted    the\n\nDefendants’ motion in both cases, with one exception, which\n\nrequired DOD to submit a more detailed justification as to why\n\nthe deliberative process exemption (asserted through Exemption\n\n5) applied to two unclassified memos listed in its Vaughn index.\n\n\n\n                                      19\n\fSee Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 553.                    Later in January\n\n2013, after receiving a supplemental submission from DOD, the\n\nDistrict      Court   granted     the    Defendants’    motion    for    summary\n\njudgment with respect to the two unclassified DOD memos. See New\n\nYork Times Co. v. U. S. DOJ (“Dist. Ct. Supp. Op.”), Nos. 11 Civ.\n\n9336, 12 Civ. 794, 2013 WL 238928 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2013).\n\n    In its principal opinion, which we discuss in more detail in\n\nParts   III    and    IV,   below,      the   Court   first    ruled    that   the\n\nGovernment     had    conducted    an    adequate     search   for     responsive\n\ndocuments. See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 532-33.                       The\n\nCourt then considered separately each of the Government’s claims\n\nto an exemption.\n\n    As to Exemption 1, concerning properly classified documents,\n\nthe Court first ruled that there was no evidence that any of the\n\ndocuments withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 had not been properly\n\nclassified. See id. at 535.             The Court specifically considered\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ claim that legal analysis could not be classified\n\nand rejected the claim. See id.\n\n    Turning to the Plaintiffs’ claim of waiver, the Court,\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fciting Wilson v. CIA, 586 F.3d 171, 186 (2d Cir. 2009), first\n\nruled that waiver of Exemption 1 had not occurred with respect\n\nto   classified       documents   containing         operational     details   of\n\ntargeted killing missions. See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n535-37.     The Court then specifically considered whether waiver\n\nof   Exemption    1    had   occurred        with   respect   to    the   OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum and rejected the claim. See id. at 538.\n\n     As to Exemption 3, which protects records exempted from\n\ndisclosure by statute, the District Court first noted that\n\nsection 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act, now codified at\n\n50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1) (2013), is an exempting statute within the\n\nmeaning of Exemption 3, and that this provision protects from\n\ndisclosure “intelligence sources and methods.” Id. at 539.                     The\n\nCourt     then   reckoned    with   ACLU’s          contention     that   placing\n\nindividuals on kill lists does not fall within the category of\n\nintelligence sources and methods.               Agreeing with a decision of\n\na district court in the District of Columbia, ACLU v. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 808 F. Supp. 2d 280, 290-92 (D.D.C. 2011) (“Drone Strike\n\nCase”), which was later reversed on appeal, see ACLU v. CIA, 710\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\fF.3d 422 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the District Court here rejected\n\nACLU’s argument. See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 540.                   The\n\nDistrict Court then specifically focused on the issue whether\n\nlegal analysis could fall within the category of intelligence\n\nsources and methods.    Acknowledging that it is “entirely logical\n\nand plausible” that intelligence sources and methods could be\n\nredacted from legal analysis upon in camera inspection, the Court\n\ndeclined to make such inspection or resolve the issue because it\n\nconcluded   that   Exemption    5   “plainly        applies”      to   the   legal\n\nanalysis that is sought here. See id.\n\n    The District Court then determined that section 6 of the CIA\n\nAct, 50 U.S.C. § 403g, now codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (2013),\n\nis an exempting statute within the meaning of Exemption 3 and\n\nthat section 6 protects from disclosure information concerning\n\nthe “functions” of CIA. See id. at 541.                Again, following the\n\ndistrict court decision in the Drone Strike Case, before it was\n\nreversed,   the    District    Court        here   ruled   that    Exemption    3\n\npermitted CIA, in response to ACLU’s request, to refuse to reveal\n\nthe existence of records concerning drone strikes. See id.\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f    As to Exemption 5, covering “inter-agency or intra-agency\n\nmemorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\nparty other than an agency in litigation with the agency,” the\n\nDistrict Court noted that this exemption applies to documents\n\nwithheld “under the deliberative process privilege (a.k.a., the\n\nexecutive privilege) and the attorney-client privilege,” citing\n\nthis Court’s decision in Tigue v. U.S. Dep’t ofJustice, 312 F.3d\n\n70, 76 (2d Cir. 2002). See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 541-\n\n42. OLC relied on the deliberative process privilege to withhold\n\nthe classified OLC-DOD Memorandum, which both Plaintiffs sought,\n\nand DOD relied on this privilege to withhold the two unclassified\n\ndocuments on its Vaughn index that ACLU requested.    These two,\n\nnumbered 9 and 10, were described as “Memorandum from Legal\n\nCounsel to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the National\n\nSecurity Legal Advisor with legal analysis regarding the effect\n\nof U.S. citizenship on targeting enemy belligerents.” JA 409.\n\n    With respect to the OLC-DOD Memorandum, the District Court,\n\naccepting N.Y. Times’s concession that this document at one time\n\nmight have been properly withheld under the deliberative process\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fand/or attorney-client privileges, see id. at 544, rejected the\n\nPlaintiffs’ contentions that these privileges had been lost\n\nbecause of one or more of the following principles: waiver,\n\nadoption, or working law, see id. at 546-50.\n\n    As to documents 9 and 10 on DOD’s Vaughn index, the Court\n\ninitially found DOD’s justification for invoking Exemption 5\n\ninadequate,   see   id.   at   545,        but   ruled    that   a   subsequent\n\nsubmission    sufficiently     supported         the     application    of   the\n\ndeliberative process privilege and hence Exemption 5 to these\n\ndocuments, see Dist. Ct. Supp. Op., 2013 WL 238928, at *1.\n\n    Finally, the District Court considered the Glomar and no\n\nnumber, no list responses that were given by DOJ, DOD, and CIA.\n\nApparently accepting the sufficiency of the affidavits submitted\n\nby officials of these agencies to justify the responses under\n\nExemptions 1 and 3, the Court turned its attention to the\n\nPlaintiffs’   claims   that    these       protections     had   been   waived.\n\nAgain, following the district court opinion in the Drone Strike\n\nCase, before it was reversed, the District Court here concluded\n\nthat none of the public statements of senior officials waived\n\n\n\n                                      24\n\fentitlement to submit Glomar or no number, no list responses\n\nbecause “[i]n none of these statements is there a reference to\n\nany particular records pertaining to the [targeted killing]\n\nprogram, let alone the number or nature of those records.” Dist.\n\nCt. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 553 (emphases in original).\n\n     Information made public after the District Court opinions.9\n\n\n     9\n       As a general rule, a FOIA decision is evaluated as of the time\nit was made and not at the time of a court's review.       See, e.g.,\nBonner v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 928 F.2d 1148, 1152 (D.C. Cir. 1991)\n(“To require an agency to adjust or modify its FOIA responses based on\npost-response occurrences could create an endless cycle of judicially\nmandated reprocessing.”). On this basis, the Government argues that\nwe cannot consider any official disclosures made after the District\nCourt's opinion.\n\n     We disagree.    Although we are not required to consider such\nevidence, the circumstances of this case support taking judicial\nnotice of the statements here.     See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). The\nGovernment's post-request disclosures “go[] to the heart of the\ncontested issue,” Powell v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 927 F.2d 1239,\n1243 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted), and, as\ndiscussed below, are inconsistent with some of its prior claims,\nincluding that the Government has never acknowledged CIA’s operational\ninvolvement. Taking judicial notice of such statements is the same\ncourse taken by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in its\nrecent ACLU v. C.I.A. decision. 710 F.3d at 431. We conclude that it\nis the most sensible approach to ongoing disclosures by the Government\nmade in the midst of FOIA litigation.\n\n     Moreover, the Government’s request for an opportunity to submit\nnew material concerning public disclosures made after the District\nCourt’s decision was honored by affording the Government an\nopportunity, after oral argument, to submit such material ex parte for\nin camera inspection, which the Government has done.\n\n                                  25\n\fAfter the District Court entered judgment for the Defendants, one\n\ndocument and several statements of Government officials that the\n\nPlaintiffs   contend     support   their     claims        became    publicly\n\navailable.    The document is captioned “DOJ White Paper” and\n\ntitled “Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S.\n\nCitizen Who Is a Senior Operational Leader of Al-Qa’ida or an\n\nAssociated   Force”    (“DOJ   White    Paper”).      As    the     Government\n\nacknowledges, see Br. for Appellees at 25, the 16-page, single-\n\nspaced DOJ White Paper was leaked to the press and subsequently\n\nofficially disclosed by DOJ.10     The leak occurred on February 4,\n\n\n     10\n       The DOJ White Paper was leaked to Michael Isikoff, a reporter\nwith    NBC   News,    according    to   a    report   available    at\nhttp://nbcnews.to/U1ZII3; the text of the leaked document is available\nvia a link at that website. (Hard copies of the documents available\nat this and all other websites cited in this opinion, as well as\ncopies of videos available at websites cited in this opinion, to the\nextent they can be copied, have been docketed with the Clerk of Court\nfor public reference.) The official disclosure, acknowledged by the\nGovernment, see Br. for Appellees at 25, was made by OIP on Feb. 4,\n2013, in response to an FOIA request submitted by Truthout, according\nto a report available at http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/14585-\ntargeted-killing-white-paper-leaked-to-nbc-news-turned-over-to-\ntruthout-by-doj-in-response-to-a-six-month-old-foia-request-four-days-\nlater; the text of the officially disclosed document is available via\na     link      at      that      website        and     also       at\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/602342-draft-white-paper.html.\nThe document disclosed to Truthout is marked “draft”; the document\nleaked to Isikoff is not marked “draft” and is dated November 8, 2011.\nThe texts of the two documents are identical, except that the document\n\n                                   26\n\f2013; the official disclosure occurred four days later.\n\n     The statements are those of John O.          Brennan, Attorney\n\nGeneral Eric Holder, and President Obama.       Brennan, testifying\n\nbefore the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on February\n\n7, 2013, on his nomination to be director of CIA, said, among\n\nother things, “The Office of Legal Counsel advice establishes the\n\nlegal boundaries within which we can operate.” Open Hearing on\n\nthe Nomination of John O. Brennan to be Director of the Central\n\nIntelligence Agency Before the S. Select Comm. on Intelligence,\n\n\nleaked to Isikoff is not dated and not marked “draft.”\n\n     ACLU contends that DOJ did not release the DOJ White Paper in\nresponse to its FOIA request, nor list it on its Vaughn index. See Br.\nfor ACLU at 21 n.7. The Government responds that ACLU had narrowed\nits request to exclude “draft legal analyses,” Letter from Eric A.O.\nRuzicka to Sarah S. Normand (Apr. 3, 2012), and that the DOJ White\nPaper was “part of document number 60 on the Vaughn index submitted by\nthe Office of Legal Counsel as an attachment to a responsive e-mail.\nSee Br. for Appellees at 25 n.8. The OLC’s Vaughn index describes\ndocument number 60 as “E-mail circulating draft legal analysis\nregarding the application of domestic and international law to the use\nof lethal force in a foreign country against U.S. citizens in certain\ncircumstances, and discussion regarding interagency deliberations\nconcerning the same” and invokes Exemption 5.         Apparently, OLC\nexpected ACLU to understand “circulating” to mean “attachment.”\n\n     The Government offers no explanation as to why the identical text\nof the DOJ White Paper, not marked “draft,” obtained by Isikoff, was\nnot disclosed to ACLU, nor explain the discrepancy between the\ndescription of document number 60 and the title of the DOJ White\nPaper.\n\n                                  27\n\f113 Cong. 57 (Feb. 7, 2013) (“Brennan Hearing”), available at\n\nhttp://www.intelligence.senate.gov/130207/transcript.pdf. Holder\n\nsent a letter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Senate\n\nJudiciary Committee on May 22, 2013 (“Holder Letter”).11      In that\n\nletter Holder stated, “The United States . . . has specifically\n\ntargeted and killed one U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Aulaqi,” Holder\n\nLetter at unnumbered second page, and acknowledged that United\n\nStates counterterrorism operations had killed Samir Khan and\n\nAbdulrahman al-Awlaki, who, he states, were not targeted by the\n\nUnited States, see id. He also stated, “[T]he Administration has\n\ndemonstrated its commitment to discussing with the Congress and\n\nthe American people the circumstances in which it could lawfully\n\nuse lethal force in a foreign country against a U.S. citizen who\n\nis a senior operational leader of al-Qa’ida or its associated\n\nforces, and is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans.”\n\nId.   He also stated, “The decision to target Anwar al-Aulaki was\n\nlawful . . . .” Id. at fourth unnumbered page.       President Obama\n\ndelivered an address at the National Defense University on May\n\n\n      11\n       The Holder Letter is available at http://www.justice.gov/ag/AG-\nletter-5-22-13.pdf.\n\n                                  28\n\f23, 2013.12     In that address, the President listed al-Awlaki’s\n\nterrorist activities and acknowledged that he had “authorized the\n\nstrike that took him out.”\n\n                               Discussion\n\nI. FOIA Standards.\n\n    FOIA calls for “broad disclosure of Government records.” CIA\n\nv. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).         The disclosure obligation is\n\nsubject to several exemptions.           However, “consistent with the\n\nAct’s    goal    of   broad   disclosure,       these     exemptions    have\n\nconsistently been given a narrow compass.” Dep’t of Interior v.\n\nKlamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).            Exemptions 1 (classified\n\ndocuments), 3 (documents protected by statute), and 5 (privileged\n\ndocuments), outlined above, have been invoked in this litigation.\n\n“The agency asserting the exemption bears the burden of proof,\n\nand all doubts as to the applicability of the exemption must be\n\nresolved in favor of disclosure.” Wilner, 592 F.3d at 69.                   To\n\nmeet its burden of proof, the agency can submit “[a]ffidavits or\n\n\n    12\n        The President’s       address    is   available    via   a   link   at\nhttp://wh.gov/hrTq.\n\n                                    29\n\fdeclarations giving reasonably detailed explanations why any\n\nwithheld documents fall within an exemption.”   ACLU v. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 681 F.3d 61, 69 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment in FOIA litigation. See Wilner, 592 F.3d at 69.     When\n\nan agency claims that a document is exempt from disclosure, we\n\nreview that determination and justification de novo. See id.\n\nWhen the claimed exemptions involve classified documents in the\n\nnational security context, the Court must give “substantial\n\nweight to an agency's affidavit concerning the details of the\n\nclassified status of the disputed record.”   ACLU, 681 F.3d at 69\n\n(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nII. Appellants’ Claims\n\n    Narrowing the scope of the Shane request (OLC opinions that\n\naddress the legal status of targeted killings) and the Savage\n\nrequest (OLC memoranda analyzing the circumstances under which\n\nit would be lawful to kill a United States citizen who is deemed\n\nto be a terrorist), Appellant N.Y. Times presses on appeal its\n\n\n\n                               30\n\frequest to OLC for disclosure of the OLC-DOD memorandum.    N.Y.\n\nTimes also requests a Vaughn index of all withheld documents,\n\ninstead of the no number, no list and Glomar responses it has\n\nreceived. See Br. for N.Y. Times at 51-52. ACLU seeks disclosure\n\nof the OLC-DOD memorandum; what it refers to as “the Unclassified\n\nMemos,” Br. for ACLU at 50, 61, which are documents nos. 9 and\n\n10 on DOD’s Vaughn index, see Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n545; and “certain OLC memoranda that the agencies have not\n\naddressed in this litigation but whose existence they have\n\nofficially acknowledged in public statements,” Br. for ACLU at\n\n50.    ACLU also requests Vaughn indices and asks that OIP be\n\nrequired “to renew its search for responsive documents.” Br. for\n\nACLU at 61.\n\nIII. The OLC-DOD Memorandum\n\n      The OLC-DOD Memorandum, as described by OLC, is an “OLC\n\nopinion pertaining to the Department of Defense marked classified\n\n. . .[t]hat . . . contains confidential legal advice to the\n\nAttorney General, for his use in interagency deliberations,\n\nregarding a potential military operation in a foreign country.”\n\n\n\n                               31\n\fBies Decl. ¶ 30.\n\n     OLC      withheld     the   OLC-DOD      Memorandum    as   protected     from\n\ndisclosure by Exemption 5 “because it is protected                        by    the\n\ndeliberative process and attorney-client privileges.” Id.                       DOD\n\nwithheld the document under Exemptions 1 and 5 “because the\n\ncontent of the document contains information about military\n\noperations, intelligence sources and methods, foreign government\n\ninformation, foreign relations, and foreign activities.” Neller\n\nDecl.     ¶   17.        General   Neller      stated   that     the   classified\n\ninformation         in   the   OLC-DOD     Memorandum      “is   not   reasonably\n\nsegregable.” Id.\n\n     In upholding the application of Exemption 1 to the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum, the District Court first ruled that the affidavits\n\nsupplied      by    senior     Government      officials    demonstrated       that\n\nclassification had been properly made. See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 535.          The Court then ruled that legal analysis may\n\nbe classified, citing three district court opinions.13                   See id.\n\n\n     13\n       New York Times Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 872 F. Supp. 2d\n309, 312-13, 317-18 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), ACLU v. Office of the Director of\nNational Intelligence, No. 10 Civ. 4419, 2011 WL 5563520, at *8\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2011), and Center for International Environmental\n\n                                         32\n\fAfter pointing out that Exemption 1 applies to documents properly\n\nclassified pursuant to an Executive Order and that Executive\n\nOrder No. 13526 “applies to any information that ‘pertains to’\n\nmilitary plans or intelligence activities (including covert\n\naction), sources or methods,” id., the Court stated, “I see no\n\nreason why legal analysis cannot be classified pursuant to E.O.\n\n13526 if it pertains to matters that are themselves classified,”\n\nid.\n\n      In considering the application of Exemption 5 to the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum, the District Court noted the Government’s claim that\n\nboth the deliberative process and attorney-client privileges\n\nprotected the document, and observed that N.Y. Times did not\n\ndisagree that the document might at one time have been withheld\n\nunder both privileges. See id. at 544.\n\n      After determining that Exemptions 1 and 5 applied to the\n\nOLC-DOD   Memorandum,   the   Court    considered   and   rejected   the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims that the Government had waived application of\n\nthese exemptions.    With respect to waiver of Exemption 1, the\n\n\nLaw v. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 505 F. Supp. 2d 150,\n154 (D.D.C. 2007).\n\n                                  33\n\fCourt stated that waiver occurs only where the government has\n\n“officially” disclosed the information sought, Dist. Ct. Op., 915\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 536 (citing Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279, 294 (2d\n\nCir.    1989)),   and   that    official     disclosure   of    classified\n\ninformation occurs only if the classified information is “‘as\n\nspecific as the information previously released,’” “‘match[es]\n\nthe information previously disclosed,’” and was “‘made public\n\nthrough an official and documented disclosure,’” id. (quoting\n\nWilson, 586 F.3d at 186).          The District Court ruled that no\n\nofficial disclosure had been made concerning documents containing\n\noperational details of targeted killings, sought by ACLU, see\n\nid., and that none of the public pronouncements cited by the\n\nPlaintiffs “reveals the necessary detailed legal analysis that\n\nsupports the Administration’s conclusion that targeted killing,\n\nwhether    of   citizens   or   otherwise,    is   lawful,”    id.   at   538\n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n       With respect to waiver of Exemption 5, the District Court\n\nruled that the deliberative process privilege had not been waived\n\nbecause “there is no evidence that the Government continually\n\n\n\n                                    34\n\frelied    upon   and   repeated    in   public   the    arguments    made\n\nspecifically in the OLC-DOD Memo,” id. at 549 (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that “it is\n\nsheer speculation that this particular OLC memorandum . . .\n\ncontains the legal analysis that justifies the Executive Branch’s\n\nconclusion that it is legal in certain circumstances to target\n\nsuspected terrorists, including United States citizens, for\n\nkilling away from a ‘hot’ field of battle,” id.           The Court saw\n\nno need to consider the plaintiffs’ claim of waiver in the\n\ncontext of the attorney-client privilege because the deliberative\n\nprocess   privilege    protected    the   OLC-DOD      Memorandum   under\n\nExemption 5. See id.\n\n    We agree with the District Court’s conclusions that the OLC-\n\nDOD Memorandum was properly classified and that no waiver of any\n\noperational details in that document has occurred.          With respect\n\nto the document’s legal analysis, we conclude that waiver of\n\nExemptions 1 and 5 has occurred.14      “Voluntary disclosures of all\n\n\n\n    14\n       We therefore need not consider the Appellants’ claim that the\nlegal analysis in the OLC-DOD Memorandum was not subject to\nclassification.\n\n                                   35\n\for   part   of   a   document   may   waive   an   otherwise   valid   FOIA\n\nexemption,” Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 880 F.\n\nSupp. 145, 150-51 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (citing Mobil Oil Corp. v.\n\nE.P.A., 879 F.2d 698, 700 (9th Cir. 1989)), vacated in part on\n\nother grounds, 907 F. Supp. 79 (S.D.N.Y. 1995), and the attorney-\n\nclient and deliberative privileges, in the context of Exemption\n\n5, may be lost by disclosure, see Brennan Center for Justice v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 697 F.3d 184, 208 (2d Cir. 2012).\n\n     (a) Loss of Exemption 5.         Exemption 5 “‘properly construed,\n\ncalls for disclosure of all opinions and interpretations which\n\nembody the agency’s effective law and policy, and the withholding\n\nof all papers which reflect the agency's group thinking in the\n\nprocess of working out its policy and determining what its law\n\nshall be.’” Id. at 196 (quoting NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421\n\nU.S. 132, 153 (1975)).      At the same time, we recognize that “the\n\nlaw extends the privilege to legal advice given by a lawyer to\n\nhis client [because] statements by the lawyer often reveal –\n\nexpressly or by necessary implication –             assumptions of fact\n\nbased on statements by the client,” George A. Davidson & William\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fH. Voth, Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege, 64 Oregon L.\n\nRev. 637, 650 (1986).\n\n    In considering waiver of the legal analysis in the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum, we note initially the numerous statements of senior\n\nGovernment      officials      discussing    the   lawfulness       of    targeted\n\nkilling    of   suspected      terrorists,       which    the    District    Court\n\ncharacterized as “an extensive public relations campaign to\n\nconvince the public that [the Administration’s] conclusions\n\n[about the lawfulness of the killing of al-Awlaki] are correct.”\n\nDist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 524.                   In a March 25, 2010,\n\nspeech    at    the   annual    meeting     of   the     American       Society   of\n\nInternational Law in Washington, D.C., then-Legal Adviser of the\n\nState    Department     Harold     Hongju    Koh    said,       “U.S.    targeting\n\npractices, including lethal operations conducted with the use of\n\nunmanned    aerial     vehicles,    comply       with    all    applicable    law,\n\nincluding the laws of war.” JA 113, 124.                In a February 22, 2012,\n\nspeech at the Yale Law School, Jeh Johnson, then-General Counsel\n\nof DOD, “summarize[d] . . . some of the basic legal principles\n\nthat form the basis for the U.S. military’s counterterrorism\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\fefforts against Al Qaeda and its associated forces,” JA 399, and\n\nreferring explicitly to “targeted killing,” said, “In an armed\n\nconflict, lethal force against known, individual members of the\n\nenemy is a long-standing and long-legal practice,” JA 402.\n\n    In a March 5, 2012, speech at Northwestern University,\n\nAttorney General Holder said, “[I]t is entirely lawful – under\n\nboth United States law and applicable law of war principles – to\n\ntarget specific senior operational leaders of al Qaeda and\n\nassociated forces.” JA 449. He discussed the relevance of the Due\n\nProcess Clause, id., and maintained that killing a senior al\n\nQaeda leader would be lawful at least in circumstances where\n\n    [f]irst, the U.S. government has determined, after a\n    thorough and careful review, that the individual poses\n    an imminent threat of violent attack against the United\n    States; second, capture is not feasible; and third, the\n    operation would be conducted in a manner consistent\n    with applicable law of war principles.\n\nJA 450.   Amplifying this last point, he stated that “use of\n\nlethal force by the United States will comply with the four\n\nfundamental law of war principles governing the use of force:\n\n. . . necessity[,] . . . distinction[,] . . . proportionality[,]\n\n. . . [and] humanity.” Id.    As the District Court noted, “The\n\n\n                               38\n\fNorthwestern Speech [by the Attorney General] discussed the legal\n\nconsiderations that the Executive Branch takes into consideration\n\nbefore targeting a suspected terrorist for killing” and “the\n\nspeech constitutes a sort of road map of the decision-making\n\nprocess that the Government goes through before deciding to\n\n‘terminate’ someone ‘with extreme prejudice.’” Dist. Ct. Op., 915\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 537.\n\n    In an April 30, 2012, speech at the Wilson Center in\n\nWashington D.C., John O. Brennan, then-Assistant to the President\n\nfor Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, said, “Yes, in full\n\naccordance with the law, and in order to prevent terrorist\n\nattacks on the United States and to save American lives, the\n\nUnited States Government conducts drone strikes against specific\n\nal-Qaida terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft,\n\noften referred to publicly as drones.” JA 95.          On Feb. 7, 2013,\n\nBrennan, testifying on his nomination to be director of CIA,\n\nsaid, “The Office of Legal Counsel advice establishes the legal\n\nboundaries within which we can operate.” Brennan Hearing at 57.\n\n    Even   if   these   statements    assuring   the    public   of   the\n\n\n\n                                 39\n\flawfulness of targeted killings are not themselves sufficiently\n\ndetailed to establish waiver of the secrecy of the legal analysis\n\nin the OLC-DOD Memorandum, they establish the context in which\n\nthe most revealing document, disclosed after the District Court’s\n\ndecision, should be evaluated.        That document is the DOJ White\n\nPaper, officially released on Feb. 4, 2013. See note 9, above.\n\nBefore considering the relevance of the DOJ White Paper to the\n\nGovernment’s claim to continued secrecy and privilege of the\n\nlegal analysis in the OLC-DOD Memorandum, we describe that\n\nMemorandum, which we have examined in camera, in some detail.\n\n    The OLC-DOD Memorandum is a 41-page classified document,\n\ndated July 16, 2010, captioned:\n\n              MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n      Re: Applicability of Federal Criminal Laws and the\n                        Constitution to\nContemplated Lethal Operations Against Shykh Anwar al-Aulaki15\n\nIt was prepared on the letterhead of OLC and signed by David J.\n\nBarron, Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n    The   OLC-DOD   Memorandum   has    several   parts.   After   two\n\n\n    15\n        We have deleted classification codes from the caption and\nthroughout the document.\n\n                                 40\n\fintroductory paragraphs, Part I(A) reports intelligence that OLC\n\nhas received concerning the relationship between Al-Qaida in the\n\nArabian Peninsula (“AQAP”) and al-Qaida, the organization and\n\noperation of AQAP, and the role al-Awlaki performs with AQAP.\n\nParts I(B) and I(C) describe the manner in which government\n\nagencies would perform the targeted killing of al-Awlaki.                   Part\n\nII(A) considers Title 18 U.S.C. § 1119 (2013), entitled “Foreign\n\nmurder of United States nationals” and explains why section 1119\n\ndoes not proscribe killings covered by a traditionally recognized\n\njustification. Part II(B) explains why section 1119 incorporates\n\none such justification, the public authority justification. Part\n\nIII(A)     explains       why   the   public    authority      justification\n\nencompasses DOD’s role in the contemplated targeted killing, and\n\nPart III(B) explains why that justification encompasses another\n\nagency’s    role     in   the   killing.    Part      IV   explains   why   the\n\ncontemplated killing would not violate 18 U.S.C. § 956(a) (2013),\n\nentitled “Conspiracy to kill, maim, or injure persons or damage\n\nproperty    in   a   foreign    country.”      Part    V   explains   why    the\n\ncontemplated killing would not violate 18 U.S.C. § 2441 (2013),\n\n\n\n                                      41\n\fentitled “War crimes.”       Part VI explains why the contemplated\n\nkilling would not violate the Fourth or Fifth Amendments of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n    The     16-page,   single-spaced   DOJ      White   Paper   virtually\n\nparallels    the   OLC-DOD   Memorandum    in    its    analysis   of   the\n\nlawfulness of targeted killings.       Like the Memorandum, the DOJ\n\nWhite Paper explains why targeted killings do not violate 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1119 or 2441, or the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the\n\nConstitution, and includes an analysis of why section 1119\n\nencompasses the public authority justification.           Even though the\n\nDOJ White Paper does not discuss 18 U.S.C. § 956(a), which the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum considers, the substantial overlap in the\n\nlegal analyses in the two documents fully establishes that the\n\nGovernment may no longer validly claim that the legal analysis\n\nin the Memorandum is a secret.            After the District Court’s\n\ndecision, Attorney General Holder publicly acknowledged the close\n\nrelationship between the DOJ White Paper and previous OLC advice\n\non March 6, 2013, when he said at a hearing of the Senate\n\nCommittee on the Judiciary that the DOJ White Paper’s discussion\n\n\n\n                                  42\n\fof imminence of threatened action would be “more clear if it is\n\nread in conjunction with the underlying OLC advice.”16 Oversight\n\nof the U.S. Department of Justice Before the Senate Committee on\n\nthe Judiciary, 113th Cong. (Mar. 6, 2013).\n\n       After senior Government officials have assured the public\n\nthat        targeted    killings   are    “lawful”    and    that   OLC   advice\n\n“establishes the legal boundaries within which we can operate,”\n\nand the Government makes public a detailed analysis of nearly all\n\nthe legal reasoning contained in the OLC-DOD Memorandum, waiver\n\nof   secrecy      and    privilege   as   to   the   legal   analysis     in   the\n\nMemorandum has occurred.\n\n       The recent opinion of the District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of California, First Amendment Coalition v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Justice, No. 4:12-cv-01013-CW (N.D. Cal. April 11, 2014),\n\ndenying an FOIA request for the OLC-DOD Memorandum, is readily\n\ndistinguishable because the Court, being under the impression\n\nthat “there has been no ‘official disclosure’ of the White\n\nPaper,” id., slip op. at 24, did not assess its significance,\n\n       16\n       The statement was made in a response to a question from Senator\nMike Lee. A webcast of the hearing is available via a link at\nhttp://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=e0c4315749c1\n0b084028087a4aa80a73, at 1:51:30.\n\n                                          43\n\fwhereas in our case, the Government has conceded that the White\n\nPaper, with its detailed analysis of legal reasoning, has in fact\n\nbeen officially disclosed, see footnote 10, supra.\n\n    In resisting disclosure of the OLC-DOD Memorandum, the\n\nGovernment contends that making public the legal reasoning in the\n\ndocument will inhibit agencies throughout the Government from\n\nseeking OLC’s legal advice.        The argument proves too much.         If\n\nthis contention were upheld, waiver of privileges protecting\n\nlegal advice could never occur. In La Raza, we explained that\n\n“[l]ike the deliberative process privilege, the attorney-client\n\nprivilege may not be invoked to protect a document adopted as,\n\nor incorporated by reference into, an agency’s policy.” 411 F.3d\n\nat 360.   Here, the Government has done so by publicly asserting\n\nthat OLC advice “establishes the legal boundaries within which\n\nwe can operate”; it “cannot invoke that relied-upon authority and\n\nthen shield it from public view.”          Brennan Center, 697 F.3d at\n\n207-08.     Agencies     seeking    OLC     legal     advice    are   surely\n\nsophisticated   enough    to   know      that    in   these    circumstances\n\nattorney/client and deliberative process privileges can be waived\n\nand the advice publicly disclosed.              We need not fear that OLC\n\n\n                                    44\n\fwill lack for clients.\n\n    The   Government        also    argues      that   because     the    OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum    refers       to     earlier     OLC   documents      that    remain\n\nclassified, those assessing the legal reasoning in the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum    might    find       the   reasoning      deficient    without    an\n\nopportunity    to    see    the    previous     documents.         However,   the\n\nreasoning in the OLC-DOD Memorandum is rather elaborate, and\n\nreaders should have no difficulty assessing the reasoning on its\n\nown terms.    Moreover, the Government had no similar concern when\n\nit released the DOJ White Paper, the reasoning of which cannot\n\nbe properly assessed, on the Government’s argument, without\n\nseeing the OLC-DOD Memorandum.               Finally, the Government always\n\nhas the option of disclosing redacted versions of previous OLC\n\nadvice.\n\n    The loss of protection for the legal analysis in the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum does not mean, however, that the entire document must\n\nbe disclosed.       FOIA provides that “[a]ny reasonably segregable\n\nportion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting\n\nsuch record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\fthis subsection.” 5 U.S.C. § 552b.       The Government’s waiver\n\napplies only to the portions of the OLC-DOD Memorandum that\n\nexplain legal reasoning.   These are Parts II, III, IV, V, and VI\n\nof the document, and only these portions will be disclosed. Even\n\nwithin those portions of the document, there are matters that the\n\nGovernment contends should remain secret for reasons set forth\n\nin the Government’s classified ex parte submission, which we have\n\nreviewed in camera.\n\n    One of those reasons concerns [redacted] the Government\n\npersuasively argues warrants continued secrecy. [redacted]      We\n\nwill redact all references to that [redacted].17\n\n    Two arguments concern facts mentioned within the legal\n\nreasoning portions of the OLC-DOD Memorandum that no longer merit\n\nsecrecy.   One is the identity of the country in which al-Awlaki\n\nwas killed.   However, numerous statements by senior Government\n\nofficials identify that country as Yemen. On September 30, 2011,\n\nDOD released a transcript reporting then-Secretary of Defense\n\nPanetta stating, “[W]e’ve been working with the Yemenis over a\n\n\n    17\n       The redactions made in this paragraph implement section 2(a)\nof our order of May 28, 2014.\n\n                                46\n\flong period of time to be able to target Awlaki, and I want to\n\ncongratulate    them     on     their        efforts,   their    intelligence\n\nassistance, their operational assistance to get the job done.”\n\nJA 799.   On October 25, 2011, President Obama, appearing on a\n\nnetwork television program, said, referring to al-Awlaki, “[I]t\n\nwas important that, working with the [Yemenis,]18 we were able to\n\nremove him from the field.” Transcript of “The Tonight Show with\n\nJay Leno (Oct. 25, 2011). JA 556.                On the day al-Awlaki was\n\nkilled, September 3, 2011, DOD’s Armed Forces Press Service\n\nreported, “A U.S. airstrike that killed Yemeni-based terrorist\n\nAnwar al-Awlaki early this morning is a testament to the close\n\ncooperation    between    the    United        States   and   Yemen,   Defense\n\nSecretary Leon E. Panetta said today.” JA 651.                     The report\n\ncontinued, “Obama and Panetta congratulated the Yemenis on their\n\nintelligence   and     operational      assistance      in    targeting   [al-]\n\nAwlaki.” Id. It is no secret that al-Awlaki was killed in Yemen.\n\nHowever, the OLC-DOD Memorandum contains some references to the\n\nYemeni government that are entitled to secrecy and will be\n\n\n    18\n        The Tonight Show transcript erroneously rendered this word\n“enemies,” an error the Government acknowledged at oral argument.\n\n                                        47\n\fredacted.\n\n     The other fact within the legal reasoning portion of the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum that the Government contends merits secrecy\n\nis the identity of the agency, in addition to DOD, that had an\n\noperational role in the drone strike that killed al-Awlaki. Both\n\nfacts were deleted from the April 21 public opinion, but have\n\nbeen restored in this opinion.                Apparently not disputing that\n\nthis fact has been common knowledge for some time, the Government\n\nasserts the importance of concealing any official recognition of\n\nthe agency’s identity.           The argument comes too late.\n\n     A     March   18,   2010,    Wall    Street   Journal    article   quotes\n\nPanetta, then CIA Director:\n\n     “Anytime we get a high value target that is in the top\n     leadership of al Qaeda, it seriously disrupts their\n     operations,” Mr. Panetta said. “It sent two important\n     signals,” Mr. Panetta said. “No. 1 that we are not\n     going to hesitate to go after them wherever they try to\n     hide, and No. 2 that we are continuing to target their\n     leadership.”\n\n“Drone Kills Suspect in CIA Suicide Bombing,” The Wall Street\n\nJournal (Mar. 18, 2010).          Although the reference to “we” is not\n\nunequivocally to CIA and might arguably be taken as a reference\n\nto   the    Government    generally,      any    doubt   on   this   score   was\n\neliminated three months later.\n\n                                         48\n\f      In a June 27, 2010, interview with Jake Tapper of ABC News,\n\nPanetta said:\n\n      [W]e are engaged in the most aggressive operations in\n      the history of the CIA in that part of the world, and\n      the result is that we are disrupting their leadership.\n      We’ve taken down more than half of their Taliban\n      leadership, of their Al Qaida leadership. We just took\n      down number three in their leadership a few weeks ago.\n\n      . . .\n\n      Awlaki is a terrorist and yes, he’s a United States\n      citizen, but he is first and foremost a terrorist and\n      we’re going to treat him like a terrorist. We don’t\n      have an assassination list, but I can tell you this.\n      We have a terrorist list and he’s on it.\n\nTr.      of     This    Week     telecast,      available      at\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-\n\npanetta/story?id=11025299&singlePage=true.\n\n      On October 7, 2011, Panetta, then Secretary of Defense, was\n\nquoted as saying in a speech to sailors and Marines at the United\n\nStates Navy’s 6th Fleet headquarters in Naples, “Having moved\n\nfrom the CIA to the Pentagon, obviously I have a hell of a lot\n\nmore weapons available to me in this job than I had at the CIA,\n\nalthough the Predators aren’t bad.” “U.S.: Defense secretary\n\nrefers to CIA drone use,” Los Angeles Times (Oct. 7, 2011).\n\n      On January 29, 2012, the following occurred when Secretary\n\nof Defense Panetta was interviewed by Scott Pelley on the CBS\n\n\n                                49\n\ftelevision program “60 Minutes”:\n\n      Asked,    “You         killed     al-Awlaki?”        Panetta        “nodded\n\naffirmatively,” as described by the District Court, see Dist. Ct.\n\nOp., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 530.          Then, when asked about identifying\n\nfor   killing   a   person     who    has    been   identified     as   an    enemy\n\ncombatant, Panetta says, “It’s a recommendation we make, it’s a\n\nrecommendation the CIA director makes in my prior role . . . the\n\nPresident of the United States has to sign off.” Web Extra\n\np r e s e n t a t i o n ,                     a v a i l a b l e                a t\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7396830n, at 0:01, 2:30.\n\nCIA’s former director has publicly acknowledged CIA’s role in the\n\nkilling of al-Awlaki.\n\n      On February 7, 2014, Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House\n\nSelect Committee on Intelligence, disclosed that his committee\n\nhas overseen the CIA’s targeted-killing strikes since “even\n\nbefore they conducted that first air strike that took Awlaki.”\n\nTranscript,     Face    the    Nation,       CBS    News   (Feb.    10,      2013),\n\nhttp://cbsn.ws/ZgB9R.\n\n      On   February    11,    2014,    the    following    exchange       occurred\n\nbetween Senator Bill Nelson and James R. Clapper, Director of\n\nNational Intelligence, at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services\n\nCommittee:\n\n                                        50\n\f        Senator NELSON.  It is – you tell me if this is\n     correct – the administration’s policy that they are\n     exploring shifting the use of drones, unmanned aerial\n     vehicle strikes, from the CIA to the DOD. Is that an\n     accurate statement?\n\n          Mr. CLAPPER.    Yes, sir. it is.\n\nTestimony on Current and Future Worldwide Threats to the National\n\nSecurity of the United States, Hearing Before the Senate Armed\n\nServices     Comm.,      113th   Cong.    37   (2014),   available   at\n\nhttp://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc.14-07%20-%202-\n\n11-14.pdf.     It is no secret that CIA has a role in the use of\n\ndrones.\n\n     (b) Loss of Exemption 1.            Much of the above discussion\n\nconcerning loss of Exemption 5 is applicable to loss of Exemption\n\n1.   As the District of Columbia Circuit has noted, “Ultimately,\n\nan agency’s justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is\n\nsufficient if it appears ‘logical’ or ‘plausible.’” Wolf v. CIA,\n\n473 F.3d 370, 374-75 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Gardels v. CIA,\n\n689 F.2d 1100, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). But Gardels made it clear\n\nthat the justification must be “logical” and “plausible” “in\n\nprotecting our intelligence sources and methods from foreign\n\ndiscovery.” 689 F.2d at 1105.\n\n\n\n                                    51\n\f     The District Court noted the Government’s contention that\n\n“‘[i]t is entirely logical and plausible that the legal opinion\n\ncontains information pertaining to military plans, intelligence\n\nactivities, sources and methods, and foreign relations.’ (Gov’t\n\nMemo. in Opp’n/Reply 6).” Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 540.\n\nBut the Court then astutely observed, “[T]hat begs the question.\n\nIn   fact, legal analysis is not an ‘intelligence source or\n\nmethod.’” Id.\n\n     We recognize that in some circumstances the very fact that\n\nlegal analysis was given concerning a planned operation would\n\nrisk disclosure of the likelihood of that operation, but that is\n\nnot the situation here where drone strikes and targeted killings\n\nhave been publicly acknowledged at the highest levels of the\n\nGovernment.   We also recognize that in some circumstances legal\n\nanalysis   could   be   so   intertwined   with   facts   entitled   to\n\nprotection that disclosure of the analysis would disclose such\n\nfacts. Aware of that possibility, we have redacted, as explained\n\nabove, the entire section of the OLC-DOD Memorandum that includes\n\nany mention of intelligence gathering activities. The only other\n\n\n\n                                  52\n\ffacts mentioned in the pure legal analysis portions of the OLC-\n\nDOD Memorandum – the identification of the country where the\n\ndrone strike occurred and CIA’s role – have both already been\n\ndisclosed, also as explained above.            With respect to disclosure\n\nof CIA’s role, we can be confident that neither Senator Dianne\n\nFeinstein,    Chairman    of    the        Senate   Select   Committee     on\n\nIntelligence, nor Representative Mike Rogers, Chairman of the\n\nHouse    Select   Committee    on   Intelligence,      thought   they    were\n\nrevealing a secret when they publicly discussed CIA’s role in\n\ntargeted killings by drone strikes.19\n\n    The three-part test for “official” disclosure, relevant to\n\n\n\n    19\n       Although “the law will not infer official disclosure of\ninformation classified by the CIA from . . . release of\ninformation by another agency, or even by Congress,” Wilson, 586\nF.3d at 186-87, these members of Congress have made public\nstatements on this matter. Senator Feinstein has praised CIA for\nconducting drone strikes with less collateral damage than strikes\nconducted by the military. See “Senator Dianne Feinstein on\nDrones, Assault Weapons Ban,” The Takeaway (Mar. 20, 2013),\navailable at http:www.thetakeaway.org/story/276926-sen-dianne-\nfeinstein-drones-assault-weapons-ban/, at 2:00. Representative\nRogers told CBS that his committee has overseen CIA’s targeted\nkilling strikes “even before they conducted that first strike\nthat took [al-]Awlaki.” Transcript, Face the Nation, CBS News\n(Feb. 10, 2013), available at http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-\nthe-nation-transcripts-february-10-2013-graham-reed-and-\nrogers/4/.\n\n                                      53\n\fExemption 1, which the District Court took from Wilson, 586 F.3d\n\nat 536, has been sufficiently satisfied.      The legal analysis in\n\nthe OLC-DOD Memorandum is “‘as specific as the information\n\npreviously released’” in the DOJ White Paper, it “‘match[es] the\n\ninformation previously disclosed,’” and was “‘made public through\n\nan official and documented disclosure.’” Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F.3d\n\nat 536 (quoting Wilson, 586 F.3d at 186).          In reaching this\n\nconclusion, we do not understand the “matching” aspect of the\n\nWilson    test to require absolute identity.        Indeed, such a\n\nrequirement would make little sense. A FOIA requester would have\n\nlittle need for undisclosed information if it had to match\n\nprecisely information previously disclosed.20\n\n\n     20\n        Although we conclude that the three-part test of Wilson has\nbeen satisfied, and Wilson remains the law of this Circuit, we note\nthat a rigid application of it may not be warranted in view of its\nquestionable provenance. Wilson took the test from Wolf v. CIA, 473\nF.3d 370, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007), which took the test from Fitzgibbon v.\nCIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Fitzgibbon purported to find\nthe test in Afshar v. Dep’t of State, 702 F.2d 1125, 1133 (D.C. Cir.\n1983). The issue in Afshar was whether several books submitted to CIA\nfor clearance contained official disclosure of details of CIA’s\nrelationship with SAVAK, Iran’s intelligence service prior to 1979 and\nthe existence of a CIA station in Tehran prior to 1979.         Afshar\nrejected the claim of official disclosure for three reasons: (1) none\nof the books revealed a continuing relationship between CIA and SAVAK\nafter 1963, the date of the earliest withheld document; (2) the books\nprovided only a general outline of such a relationship; and (3) none\n\n                                  54\n\f     With the redactions and public disclosures discussed above,\n\nit is no longer either “logical” or “plausible” to maintain that\n\ndisclosure of the legal analysis in the OLC-DOD Memorandum risks\n\ndisclosing    any   aspect   of   “military    plans,   intelligence\n\nactivities, sources and methods, and foreign relations.”          The\n\nrelease of the DOJ White Paper, discussing why the targeted\n\nkilling of al-Awlaki would not violate several statutes, makes\n\nthis clear.   The additional discussion of 18 U.S.C. § 956(a) in\n\nthe OLC-DOD Memorandum adds nothing to the risk.             Whatever\n\n\n\nof the books was an official and documented disclosure. The second\nreason was supported by a citation to Lamont v. Dep’t of Justice, 475\nF. Supp. 761, 772 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), with a parenthetical stating that\nthe withheld information must have “already been specifically revealed\nto the public” (emphasis in Afshar). Lamont did not assert specific\nrevelation as a requirement for disclosure; it observed that the\nplaintiff had raised a factual issue as to whether the information\nsought had been specifically revealed. More important, Afshar, the\nultimate source of the three-part test, does not mention a requirement\nthat the information sought “match[es] the information previously\ndisclosed.”\n\n     Wilson also cited Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. v. Dep’t of\nthe Navy, 891 F.2d 414 (2d Cir. 1989).         Clearwater also cited\nFitzgibbon and Afshar and drew from those opinions more rigidity than\nwas warranted. The issue in Clearwater was simply whether the Navy\nhad previously disclosed, as the plaintiff claimed, that it was\nplanning to deploy nuclear weapons at the New York Harbor Homeport.\nThe Court rejected the claim, pointing out that the Navy had said only\nthat the ships to be stationed at the Homeport were capable of\ncarrying nuclear weapons. See id. at 421.\n\n                                  55\n\fprotection the legal analysis might once have had has been lost\n\nby virtue of public statements of public officials at the highest\n\nlevels and official disclosure of the DOJ White Paper.\n\nIV. Legal Analysis in Other Withheld Documents21\n\n    In addition to seeking at least the legal analysis in the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum, ACLU also seeks disclosure of the legal\n\nanalysis in documents numbered 9 and 10 on DOD’s unclassified\n\nVaughn index and in other OLC legal memoranda the existence of\n\nwhich ACLU contends have been officially acknowledged in public\n\nstatements. See Br. for ACLU at 50.     ACLU contends that Senator\n\nFeinstein said at the confirmation hearing of Brennan to be CIA\n\ndirector that there are eleven such memoranda, see id. at 50\n\nn.25, of which four were provided to the Senate Select Committee\n\non Intelligence, see id. at 24 & n.9.\n\n\n     21\n       Other than the legal analysis in the documents considered in\nthis section, it is unclear whether the Appellants are seeking on\nappeal any other withheld documents. See, e.g., Br. for ACLU at 50\n(“Plaintiffs do not challenge the bulk of those withholdings.”). In\nany event, except as to the OLC-DOD Memorandum discussed in Section\nIII, above, the documents discussed in this Section IV, and the\nindices discussed in Section V, below, on the current record, we\naffirm the District Court’s decision to withhold all other documents\nsought. After the Government submits its classified Vaughn indices on\nremand, the District Court may, as appropriate, order the release of\nany documents that are not properly withheld.\n\n                                 56\n\f       Documents numbered 9 and 10 are DOD legal memoranda, which\n\nwere    made    available         to   this     Court      ex    parte    for    in    camera\n\ninspection.         As to these documents, we agree with the District\n\nCourt    that       the   declaration          of   Richard       C.    Gross,   Brigadier\n\nGeneral, United States Army, JA 863, adequately supports the\n\napplication of Exemption 5. See Dist. Ct. Supp. Op., 2013 WL\n\n238928, at *1.             As General Gross pointed out, these brief\n\ndocuments (two and four pages respectively) are informal and\n\npredecisional.            One does not even identify the sender or the\n\nreceiver. They mention legal authorities, but in no way resemble\n\nthe detailed, polished legal analysis in the disclosed DOJ White\n\nPaper.         At    most,    they       are    “part      of    a     process   by        which\n\ngovernmental decisions and policies are formulated, [or] the\n\npersonal opinions of the writer prior to the agency’s adoption\n\nof a policy.” Public Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Management and\n\nBudget,    598 F.3d 865, 875 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (alteration in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Judicial\n\nWatch,    Inc.       v.    FDA,    449    F.3d       141,       151    (D.C.    Cir.       2006)\n\n(protecting          as    deliberative             “the    give-and-take             of    the\n\nconsultative process”) (internal quotation marks omitted).                                    No\n\nwaiver of Exemption 5 has occurred with respect to these two\n\ndocuments.\n\n\n                                               57\n\f       The other OLC legal memoranda have not been submitted to\n\nthis Court for in camera inspection, and we are therefore unable\n\nto adjudicate the waiver issue as to these memoranda, nor\n\ndetermine,    if   waiver    has    occurred,   what   portions       of   these\n\ndocuments must be redacted.          It is possible that waiver of any\n\nclaimed privileges applies to the legal reasoning in these\n\ndocuments    for   the   same      reasons   applicable    to   the    OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum.    On remand, these memoranda must be produced to the\n\nDistrict Court for in camera examination and determination of\n\nwaiver and appropriate redaction, in light of our rulings with\n\nrespect to disclosure and redaction of the legal reasoning in the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum.\n\nV. Glomar and No Number, No List Responses\n\n       As set forth above, OLC, DOD, and CIA submitted either\n\nGlomar or no number, no list responses to the N.Y. Times and ACLU\n\nrequests, in addition to Vaughn indices.           For clarification, we\n\nset forth in the margin a chart showing the revised responses of\n\nthe three agencies.22       An agency may withhold information on the\n\n\n\n\n       22\n\n\nOLC:                        DOD:                    CIA:\n\n                                       58\n\fnumber   of    responsive       documents    and     a    description     of   their\n\ncontents if those facts are protected from disclosure by a FOIA\n\nexemption.         See Wilner, 592 F.3d at 67-69; Hayden v. National\n\nSecurity Agency, 608 F.2d 1381, 1384 (D.C. Cir. 1979).                    However,\n\nwe agree with the D.C. Circuit that “[s]uch a response would only\n\nbe justified in unusual circumstances, and only by a particularly\n\npersuasive affidavit.” ACLU, 710 F.3d at 433.\n\n    The Government’s core argument to justify the Glomar and no\n\nnumber, no list responses, as it was with the effort to withhold\n\nthe OLC-DOD Memorandum, is that identification of any document\n\nthat provides legal advice to one or more agencies on the\n\nlegality      of    targeted    killings     “would      tend   to   disclose    the\n\nidentity of the agency or agencies that use targeted lethal force\n\nagainst certain terrorists who are U.S. citizens . . . .” Br. for\n\nAppellees      at    37.   If     one   of   those       agencies    is   CIA,   the\n\nGovernment’s argument continues, disclosure of any information\n\n\n\nGlomar to NYTimes;             no number, no list to       Glomar to NYTimes; no\nno number, no list to          Shane, Glomar to            number, no list to\nACLU as to classified          Savage, except OLC-         ACLU\ndocuments, except              DOD Memorandum; no\nOLC-DOD Memorandum             number, no list to\n                               ACLU as to classified\n                               documents, except\n                               OLC-DOD Memorandum\n\n\n                                        59\n\fin a Vaughn   index that “would tend to disclose the identity” of\n\nthat agency must be protected because, the Government claims,\n\n“[T]he government has never disclosed (with the exception of the\n\nBin Laden operation) whether the CIA has an operational role in\n\nthe use of targeted lethal force or is authorized to use such\n\nforce.”   Id. at 38.\n\n    As was true of waiver of privileges that might originally\n\nhave protected the legal reasoning in the OLC-DOD Memorandum, the\n\nstatements of Panetta when he was Director of CIA and later\n\nSecretary of Defense, set forth above, have already publicly\n\nidentified CIA as an agency that had an operational role in\n\ntargeted drone killings.23    With CIA identified, the Appellees’\n\nmain argument for the use of Glomar and no number, no list\n\nresponses evaporates.      The Vaughn index submitted by OLC in\n\ncamera must be disclosed, and DOD and CIA must submit classified\n\nVaughn indices to the District Court on remand for in camera\n\ninspection    and   determination    of   appropriate   disclosure   and\n\nappropriate redaction.\n\n    As was also true of the OLC-DOD Memorandum, however, the\n\nrequirement of disclosing the agencies’ Vaughn indices does not\n\n\n     23\n        For purposes of the issues on this appeal, it makes no\ndifference whether the drones were maneuvered by CIA or DOD personnel\nso long as CIA has been disclosed as having some operational role in\nthe drone strikes.\n\n                                    60\n\fnecessarily mean that either the number or the listing of all\n\ndocuments on those indices must be disclosed.                The Appellees\n\nargue persuasively that with respect to documents concerning a\n\ncontemplated military operation, disclosure of the number of such\n\ndocuments must remain secret because a large number might alert\n\nthe enemy to the need to increase efforts to defend against\n\nattacks or to avoid detection and a small number might encourage\n\na lessening of such efforts.           Accordingly, all listings after\n\nnumber 271 on OLC’s Vaughn index will remain secret. See Wilner,\n\n592 F.3d at 70 (upholding Glomar response as to identification\n\nof   documents    that    would   reveal   “details   of    [a]    program’s\n\noperations and scope”). The descriptions of listing numbers 1-4,\n\n6,   69,   72,   80-82,   87,   92,   103-04,   244-49,    and    256    reveal\n\ninformation entitled to be protected. Listing numbers 10-49, 51-\n\n56, 84-86, 94, 101, 106-09, 111-12, 114-15, 251, 255, 257-61, and\n\n266-67 describe email chains (or copies of chains).              Because the\n\nPlaintiffs informed the District Court that they were not seeking\n\nthese items, see Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 545, these\n\nlistings need not be disclosed.\n\n     No reason appears why the number, title, or description of\n\nthe remaining listed documents needs to be kept secret.                 Listing\n\nnumber 5 is the OLC-DOD Memorandum; listing numbers 7-9, 50, 250,\n\n262-65,    and   269-71    describe    documents    and    attorney       notes\n\n                                      61\n\fconcerning legal advice; listing numbers 57-68, 70-71, 73-79, 83,\n\n88-91, 93, 95-100, 102, 105, 110, 113, 116-22, and 144-45 are\n\ndescribed as including factual information concerning al-Awlaki;\n\nlisting numbers 123-30 are described as unclassified open source\n\nmaterials; listing numbers 131-43 and 148-237 are described as\n\ndrafts of the OLC-DOD Memorandum; listing numbers 238-43 are\n\ndescribed as drafts of other documents; listing numbers 146-47\n\nare described as drafts of Document 86A, a listing that does not\n\nappear on the OLC’s Vaughn index; and listing numbers 244, 246,\n\n248, 252-54, 256, and 268 are described as including [redacted]24.\n\n    Some, perhaps all, of the information in many of these\n\ndocuments         might    be       protected   as   classified     intelligence\n\ninformation or predecisional.               If the Plaintiffs challenge the\n\napplicability of a cited exemption, the District Court, after in\n\ncamera inspection, will be able to determine which of these\n\ndocuments need to be withheld and which portions of these\n\ndocuments        need     to   be    redacted   as   subject   to   one   or   more\n\nexemptions that have not been waived.                 At this stage, we decide\n\nonly that the number, title, and description of all documents\n\nlisted on OLC’s classified Vaughn index must be disclosed, with\n\nthe exception of listing numbers 1-4, 6, 69, 72, 80-82, 87, 92,\n\n\n        24\n             This redaction implements section 2(a) of our order of May 28,\n2014.\n\n                                           62\n\f103-04, 244-49; 10-49, 51-56, 84-86, 94, 101, 106-09, 111-12,\n\n114-15, 251, 252-54, 255-61, 266-67, 268; and all listings after\n\nlisting number 271.\n\n    Unlike OLC, DOD and CIA did not provide this Court with\n\nclassified Vaughn indices, and we are unable to distinguish among\n\nlisted document numbers, which titles or descriptions merit\n\nsecrecy. We will therefore direct that, upon remand, DOD and CIA\n\nwill provide the District Court with classified Vaughn indices\n\nlisting documents responsive to the Plaintiffs’ requests.          From\n\nthese indices, the District Court, with the guidance provided by\n\nthis opinion, should have little difficulty, after examining\n\nwhatever further affidavits DOD and CIA care to submit to claim\n\nprotection of specific listings, to determine which listings on\n\nthese indices may be disclosed.          See ACLU, 710 F.3d at 432\n\n(prescribing   a   similar   procedure   after   rejecting   a   Glomar\n\nresponse).\n\nVI. Adequacy of OIP’s Search\n\n    Finally, ACLU argues that OIP did not make an adequate\n\nsearch because it did not disclose thirty e-mail chains with\n\nother   DOJ offices that were found during OLC’s search for\n\nresponsive records.    See Br. for ACLU at 60.      However, as this\n\nCourt has recognized, a search is not inadequate merely because\n\n                                  63\n\fit does not identify all responsive records. See Grand Central\n\nPartnership, Inc. v. Cuomo, 166 F.3d 473, 489 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\nThe adequacy of a search is not measured by its results, but\n\nrather by its method. See Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 745\n\nF.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984).         To show that a search is\n\nadequate, the agency affidavit “must be relatively detailed and\n\nnonconclusory,   and   submitted   in   good   faith.”   Grand   Central\n\nPartnership, 166 F.3d at 489 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe affidavit submitted by an OIP official, JA 412-419 ¶¶ 7-34,\n\neasily meets these requirements, and the November 3, 2011, cut-\n\noff date was reasonable as the date on which the search was\n\ncommenced. See Edmonds Institute v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 383\n\nF. Supp. 2d 105, 110-11 (D.D.C. 2005).\n\n                             Conclusion\n\n    For the reasons stated above, we conclude that:\n\n       (1) a redacted version of the OLC-DOD Memorandum\n\n       (attached as Appendix A to this opinion) must be\n\n       disclosed;\n\n       (2) a redacted version of the classified Vaughn\n\n       index submitted by OLC must be disclosed, including\n\n\n\n                                   64\n\f          the number, title, and description of all documents,\n\n          with the exception of listing numbers 1-4, 6, 10-49,\n\n          51-56, 69, 72, 80-82, 84-87, 92, 94, 101, 103-04,\n\n          106-09, 111-12, 114-15, 244-49, 251, 252-54, 255-61,\n\n          266-67, 268; and all listings after listing number\n\n          271;\n\n          (3) other legal memoranda prepared by OLC and at\n\n          issue here must be submitted to the District Court\n\n          for in camera inspection and determination of waiver\n\n          of privileges and appropriate redaction;\n\n          (4) the Glomar and “no number, no list” responses\n\n          are insufficiently justified;\n\n          (5) DOD and CIA must submit Vaughn indices to the\n\n          District   Court    for     in   camera   inspection   and\n\n          determination      of     appropriate     disclosure   and\n\n          appropriate redaction; and\n\n          (6) the OIP search was sufficient.\n\n    We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.25\n\n                                  Appendix A\n\n\n     25\n       Prior to filing, we have made this opinion available to the\nGovernment in camera to afford an opportunity to advise whether any\nclassified information, not intended to be disclosed by this opinion,\nhas been inadvertently disclosed.\n\n                                      65\n\fOLC-DOD Memorandum after appropriate redactions and deletion\nof classification codes (redactions in the OLC-DOD Memorandum\n                are indicated by white spaces)\n\n\n\n\n                             66\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f",

The suits were brought against the Defendants-Appellees\n\nUnited States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the United States\n\nDepartment of Defense (“DOD”), and the Central Intelligence\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fAgency (“CIA”) (sometimes collectively the “Government”).\n\n       We emphasize at the outset that the Plaintiffs’ lawsuits do\n\nnot    challenge   the    lawfulness       of    drone    attacks    or    targeted\n\nkillings.      Instead,    they    seek     information       concerning      those\n\nattacks, notably, documents prepared by DOJ’s Office of Legal\n\nCounsel (“OLC”) setting forth the Government’s reasoning as to\n\nthe lawfulness of the attacks.\n\n       The issues primarily concern the validity of FOIA responses\n\nthat (a) decline to reveal even the existence of any documents\n\nresponsive to particular requests (so-called “Glomar responses”\n\n(described below)), (b) acknowledge the existence of responsive\n\ndocuments but decline to reveal either the number or description\n\nof such documents (so-called “no number, no-list” responses\n\n(described     below)),    (c)    assert        various    FOIA     exemptions   or\n\nprivileges claimed to prohibit disclosure of various documents\n\nthat    have   been   publicly     identified,            notably    the    OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum and other OLC legal opinions, and (d) challenge the\n\nadequacy of a FOIA search conducted by one office of DOJ.\n\n       We conclude that (1) a redacted version of the OLC-DOD\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fMemorandum must be disclosed, (2) a redacted version of the\n\nclassified Vaughn index (described below) submitted by OLC must\n\nbe disclosed, (3) other legal opinions prepared by OLC must be\n\nsubmitted to the District Court for in camera inspection and\n\ndetermination of waiver of privileges and appropriate redaction,\n\n(4)   the   Glomar    and   “no     number,    no   list”   responses   are\n\ninsufficiently justified, (5) DOD and CIA must submit Vaughn\n\nindices to the District Court for in camera inspection and\n\ndetermination    of    appropriate        disclosure    and    appropriate\n\nredaction, and (6) the Office of Information Policy (“OIP”)\n\nsearch was sufficient.      We therefore affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand.\n\n                                  Background\n\n      The FOIA requests at issue in this case focus primarily on\n\nthe drone attacks in Yemen that killed Anwar al-Awlaki2 and Samir\n\nKhan in September 2011 and al-Awlaki’s teenage son, Abdulrahman\n\nal-Awlaki, in October 2011. All three victims were United States\n\n\n      2\n       This spelling, which we adopt (except in quotations), is used\nby the District Court and in the Government’s brief. The briefs of\nN.Y. Times and ACLU and numerous documents in the record render the\nname “al-Aulaqi.”\n\n                                      6\n\fcitizens either by birth or naturalization.\n\n    Statutory Framework. FOIA provides, with exceptions not\n\nrelevant to this case, that an “agency, upon any request for\n\nrecords which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is\n\nmade in accordance with published rules . . . , shall make the\n\nrecords   promptly   available       to   any   person.”   5   U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(3)(A) (2013).   FOIA contains several exemptions, three\n\nof which are asserted in this case.\n\n    Exemption 1 exempts records that are “(A) specifically\n\nauthorized under criteria established by an Executive order to\n\nbe kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign\n\npolicy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such\n\nExecutive order.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1) (2013).       Executive Order\n\n13526 allows an agency to withhold information that (1) “pertains\n\nto” one of the categories of information specified in the\n\nExecutive order, including “intelligence activities (including\n\ncovert action),” “intelligence sources or methods,” or “foreign\n\nrelations or foreign activities of the United States” and (2) if\n\n“unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fexpected to cause identifiable and describable damage to the\n\nnational security.”     Executive Order No. 13526 § 1.1(a)(3)-(4),\n\n1.4(c)-(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 708, 709 (Dec. 29, 2009).\n\n     Exemption 3 exempts records that are “specifically exempted\n\nfrom disclosure by [another] statute” if the relevant statute\n\neither “requires that the matters be withheld from the public in\n\nsuch a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue” or\n\n“establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to\n\nparticular   types    of    matters       to   be    withheld.”        5   U.S.C.\n\n§   552(b)(3)(A)(i),       (ii)   (2013).           Two   such    statutes      are\n\npotentially relevant here.        The Central Intelligence Agency Act\n\nof 1949, as amended, provides that the Director of National\n\nIntelligence “shall be responsible for protecting intelligence\n\nsources or methods,” and exempts CIA from “any other law which\n\nrequire[s] the publication or disclosure of the organization,\n\nfunctions,   names,    official    titles,      salaries,        or   numbers    of\n\npersonnel employed by the Agency.” 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (2013). The\n\nNational Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. § 3024-1(i)(1) (2013),\n\nexempts from disclosure “intelligence sources and methods.”\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\f    Exemption   5   exempts     “inter-agency   or   intra-agency\n\nmemorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\nparty other than an agency in litigation with the agency.” 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(5) (2013).    Exemption 5 encompasses traditional\n\ncommon law privileges against disclosure, including the attorney-\n\nclient and deliberative process privileges.          See National\n\nCouncil of La Raza v.

Times FOIA requests and Government responses.\n\nShane and Savage, New York Times reporters, submitted separate\n\nFOIA requests to OLC.   Shane’s request, submitted in June 2010,\n\nsought:\n\n    all Office of Legal Counsel opinions or memoranda since\n    2001 that address the legal status of targeted\n    killings, assassination, or killing of people suspected\n    of ties to Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups by\n    employees or contractors of the United States\n    government.\n\nJoint Appendix (“JA”) 296-97.\n\n    Savage’s request, submitted in October 2010, sought:\n\n    a copy of all Office of Legal Counsel memorandums\n    analyzing the circumstances under which it would be\n    lawful for United States armed forces or intelligence\n\n\n                                 9\n\f       community assets to target for killing a United States\n       citizen who is deemed to be a terrorist.\n\nJA 300-01.\n\n       OLC denied Shane’s request.          With respect to the portion of\n\nhis request that pertained to DOD, OLC initially submitted a so-\n\ncalled “no number, no list” response3 instead of submitting the\n\nusual Vaughn index,4 numbering and identifying by title and\n\ndescription documents that are being withheld and specifying the\n\nFOIA       exemptions    asserted.    A     no   number,    no   list   response\n\nacknowledges       the    existence   of    documents      responsive    to   the\n\nrequest, but neither numbers nor identifies them by title or\n\ndescription.       OLC said that the requested documents pertaining\n\nto DOD were being withheld pursuant to FOIA exemptions 1, 3, and\n\n5.\n\n       As to documents pertaining to agencies other than DOD, OLC\n\n\n\n       3\n       The term was apparently coined by CIA, see Bassiouni v.

See Wilner v. National Security Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1356581\"><a href=\"/opinion/1356581/wilner-v-national-sec-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (2d Cir. 2009).    OLC stated that the Glomar response was\n\ngiven “because the very fact of the existence or nonexistence of\n\nsuch documents is itself classified, protected from disclosure\n\nby statute, and privileged” under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1), (3), (5).\n\nCIA confirmed that it requested DOJ to submit a Glomar response\n\non its behalf.6\n\n     OLC also denied Savage’s request.          Declining to submit\n\neither a Vaughn index or even a no number, no list response, OLC\n\nsubmitted a Glomar response, stating that, pursuant to Exemptions\n\n1, 3, and 5, it was neither confirming nor denying the existence\n\n\n     5\n       The term derives from the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a vessel built\nto recover a sunken Soviet submarine. See Phillippi v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"341477\"><a href=\"/opinion/341477/harriet-ann-phillippi-v-central-intelligence-agency-and-george-h-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1010-12 (D.C. Cir. 1976). A Glomar response was first used in\n1992 in a case challenging a Government agency’s refusal to confirm or\ndeny the existence of certain materials requested under FOIA, see\nBenavides v. DEA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586794\"><a href=\"/opinion/586794/eduardo-m-benavides-v-drug-enforcement-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n     6\n       CIA made one exception to its request that OLC submit a Glomar\nresponse. Because CIA’s involvement in the operation that resulted in\nthe death of Osama bin Laden had been acknowledged and was not\nclassified, the agency asserted that any OLC documents related to the\nagency’s involvement in that operation would not be covered by a\nGlomar response, but added that there were no such documents.\n\n                                  11\n\fof documents described in the request. Unlike its letter denying\n\nthe Shane request, OLC’s response to the Savage request did not\n\nidentify any responsive documents relating to DOD.\n\n      During the course of the            litigation, OLC modified its\n\nresponses to the Shane and Savage requests by identifying the\n\nexistence of one document pertaining to DOD, what the District\n\nCourt and the parties have referred to as the OLC-DOD Memorandum,\n\nbut claimed that this document was exempt from disclosure under\n\nExemption 5.      Because the OLC-DOD Memorandum was classified, it\n\nwas presumably also withheld under Exemption 1.             As to all other\n\nDOD documents, it is not clear whether OLC was continuing to\n\nassert a Glomar response, as it had made to Shane, or a no\n\nnumber, no list response, as it had made to Savage.\n\n      The ACLU FOIA requests and Government responses. In October\n\n2011,     ACLU   submitted   FOIA   requests   to   three   agencies:   DOJ\n\n(including two of DOJ’s component agencies, OIP and OLC), DOD,\n\nand     CIA.     The   requests,    quoted     in   the   margin,7   sought\n\n      7\n\n      1. All records created after September 11, 2001, pertaining\n      to the legal basis in domestic, foreign, and international\n      law upon which U.S. citizens can be subjected to targeted\n      killings, whether using unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs” or\n\n                                     12\n\f“drones) or by other means.\n\n2. All records created after September 11, 2001, pertaining\nto the process by which U.S. citizens can be designated for\ntargeted killings, including who is authorized to make such\ndeterminations and what evidence is needed to support them.\n\n3. All memoranda, opinions, drafts, correspondence, and\nother records produced by the OLC after September 11, 2001,\npertaining to the legal basis in domestic, foreign, and\ninternational law upon which the targeted killing of Anwar\nal-Awlaki was authorized and upon which he was killed,\nincluding discussions of:\n\n     A. The reasons why domestic-law prohibitions on murder,\n     assassination, and excessive use of force did not\n     preclude the targeted killing of al-Awlaki;\n\n     B. The protection and requirements imposed by the Fifth\n     Amendment Due Process Clause;\n\n     C. The reasons why International-law prohibitions on\n     extrajudicial killing did not preclude the targeted\n     killing of al-Awlaki;\n\n     D. The applicability (or non-applicability) of the\n     Treason Clause to the decision whether to target al-\n     Awlaki;\n\n     E. The legal basis authorizing the CIA, JSOC, or other\n     U.S. Government entities to carry out the targeted\n     killing of Anwar Al-Awlaki;\n\n     F. Any requirement for proving that al-Awlaki posed an\n     imminent risk of harm to others, including an\n     explanation of how to define imminence in this context;\n     and\n\n     G. Any requirement that the U.S. Government first\n     attempt to capture Al-Awlaki before killing him.\n\n                              13\n\f4. All documents and records pertaining to the factual basis\nfor the targeted killing of Al-Awlaki, including:\n\n     A. Facts supporting a belief that al-Awlaki posed an\n     imminent threat to the United States or United States\n     interests;\n\n     B. Facts supporting a belief that al-Awlaki could not\n     be captured or brought to justice using nonlethal\n     means;\n\n     C.   Facts  indicating    that   there   was  a   legal\n     justification for killings persons other than al-\n     Awlaki, including other U.S. citizens, while attempting\n     to kill al-Awlaki himself;\n\n     D. Facts supporting the assertion that al-Awlaki was\n     operationally involved in al Qaeda, rather than being\n     involved merely in propaganda activities; and\n\n     E. Any other facts relevant to the decision to\n     authorize and execute the targeted killings of al-\n     Awlaki.\n\n5. All documents and records pertaining to the factual basis\nfor the killing of Samir Khan, including whether he was\nintentionally targeted, whether U.S. Government personnel\nwere aware of his proximity to al-Awlaki at the time the\nmissiles were launched at al-Awlaki’s vehicle, whether the\nUnited States took measures to avoid Khan’s death, and any\nother facts relevant to the decision to kill Khan or the\nfailure to avoid causing his death.\n\n6. All documents and records pertaining to the factual basis\nfor the killing of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, including whether\nhe was intentionally targeted, whether U.S. Government\npersonnel were aware of his presence when they launched a\nmissile or missiles at his location, whether he was targeted\non the basis of his kinship with Anwar al-Awlaki, whether\nthe United States took measures to avoid his death, and any\n\n                             14\n\fvarious documents concerning the targeted killings of United\n\nStates citizens in general and al-Awlaki, his son, and Khan in\n\nparticular.\n\n    Both OLC and CIA initially submitted Glomar responses,\n\nrefusing     to   confirm   or   deny    the   existence   of   responsive\n\ndocuments, pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n    DOD initially stated that it could not respond to the\n\nrequest within the statutory time period because of the scope and\n\ncomplexity of the request.\n\n    During the course of the litigation, the Government agencies\n\nmodified their original responses in light of statements by\n\nsenior Executive Branch officials on the legal and policy issues\n\npertaining to United States counterterrorism operations and the\n\npotential use of lethal force by the United States Government\n\nagainst senior operational leaders of al-Qaeda who are United\n\nStates citizens.\n\n    OLC provided ACLU with a Vaughn index of sixty unclassified\n\n\n     other factors relevant to the decision to kill him or the\n     failure to avoid causing his death.\n\nJA 252-53.\n\n                                    15\n\fresponsive     documents,   each    described     as    an    e-mail    chain\n\nreflecting internal deliberations concerning the legal basis for\n\nthe use of lethal force against United States citizens in a\n\nforeign country in certain circumstances.              OLC withheld these\n\ndocuments pursuant to Exemption 5.\n\n    OLC also submitted a no number, no list response as to\n\nclassified documents, stating that it could not provide the\n\nnumber or description of these documents because that information\n\nwas protected from disclosure by Exemptions 1 and 3.                OLC did\n\ndescribe one of these documents as an “OLC opinion related to DoD\n\noperations,”     Declaration   of   John   E.   Bies,    Deputy   Assistant\n\nAttorney General, OLC ¶ 38 (“Bies Decl.”), JA 279, which it\n\nwithheld in its entirety under Exemptions 1 and 3.                  This is\n\napparently not the OLC-DOD Memorandum, which OLC said was exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under Exemption 5. That this document is not the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum is confirmed by OLC’s assertion that this\n\ndocument “cannot be further identified or described on the public\n\nrecord.”   Id.      The   OLC-DOD   Memorandum     was       withheld   under\n\nExemptions 1 and 5.\n\n    OIP located one responsive document, a set of talking points\n\n                                    16\n\fprepared   for      the   Attorney   General   and    others   related    to\n\n“hypothetical       questions    about    Anwar      al-Aulaqi’s   death,”\n\nDeclaration of Douglas R. Hibbard, Deputy Chief of the Initial\n\nRequest Staff, OIP ¶ 8, JA 441, which it released to ACLU.               OIP\n\nalso issued a Vaughn index listing four unclassified records\n\nwithheld under Exemptions 3, 5, and 6.8           OIP also submitted a no\n\nnumber, no list response to various classified documents withheld\n\nunder Exemptions 1 and 3.\n\n     DOD’s revised response disclosed a speech given by Jeh\n\nJohnson, then-DOD General Counsel, at Yale Law School on February\n\n22, 2012. DOD also provided ACLU with a Vaughn index listing ten\n\nunclassified records, withheld pursuant to Exemption 5.              Seven\n\nof those documents were e-mail traffic regarding drafts of the\n\nspeech given by Johnson at Yale Law School and a speech delivered\n\nby Attorney General Holder at Northwestern University School of\n\nLaw. One of the withheld unclassified records was a presentation\n\nby   Johnson   in    February   2012,     regarding    international     law\n\n\n     8\n       Exemption 6, which is not in issue in this appeal, applies to\n“personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which\nwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (2013).\n\n                                     17\n\fprinciples, to officers who had recently obtained the rank of O-\n\n7.    The   remaining   two   withheld   unclassified   records   were\n\ndescribed as “memoranda from the Legal Counsel to the Chairman\n\nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the White House’s National\n\nSecurity Council Legal Advisor addressing the legal basis for\n\nconducting military operations against U.S. citizens in general.”\n\nDeclaration of Robert E. Neller, Lt. General, United States\n\nMarine Corp, Director of Operations for the Joint Staff at the\n\nPentagon, ¶ 16 (“Neller Decl.”). JA 334.\n\n     DOD also located responsive classified records.          One of\n\nthese was the previously mentioned OLC-DOD memorandum, which DOD\n\nwithheld under Exemptions 1 and 5.       As to the other classified\n\ndocuments, DOD submitted a no number, no list response.\n\n     CIA modified its initial Glomar responses in June 2012 by\n\nconfirming the existence of “responsive records reflecting a\n\ngeneral interest” in two areas described in the ACLU’s request:\n\n(1) “‘the legal basis . . . upon which U.S. citizens can be\n\nsubjected to targeted killing’” and (2) “‘the process by which\n\nU.S. citizens can be subjected to targeted killing.’” Declaration\n\n\n\n                                  18\n\fof John Bennett, Director, National Clandestine Service, CIA,\n\n¶ 27 (quoting ACLU request).               In these two categories, CIA\n\nsubmitted a no number, no list response, relying on Exemptions\n\n1 and 3, with the exception that CIA acknowledged that it\n\npossessed copies of speeches given by the Attorney General at\n\nNorthwestern University Law School on March 5, 2012, and by the\n\nAssistant     to    the   President        for   Homeland       Security    and\n\nCounterterrorism on April 30, 2012. See id.\n\n    The     pending   lawsuit   and    District     Court   opinions.        In\n\nDecember 2011, N.Y.

See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 532-33.                       The\n\nCourt then considered separately each of the Government’s claims\n\nto an exemption.\n\n    As to Exemption 1, concerning properly classified documents,\n\nthe Court first ruled that there was no evidence that any of the\n\ndocuments withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 had not been properly\n\nclassified.

See Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n535-37.     The Court then specifically considered whether waiver\n\nof   Exemption    1    had   occurred        with   respect   to    the   OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum and rejected the claim. See id. at 538.\n\n     As to Exemption 3, which protects records exempted from\n\ndisclosure by statute, the District Court first noted that\n\nsection 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act, now codified at\n\n50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1) (2013), is an exempting statute within the\n\nmeaning of Exemption 3, and that this provision protects from\n\ndisclosure “intelligence sources and methods.” Id. at 539.

The\n\nDistrict Court then specifically focused on the issue whether\n\nlegal analysis could fall within the category of intelligence\n\nsources and methods.    Acknowledging that it is “entirely logical\n\nand plausible” that intelligence sources and methods could be\n\nredacted from legal analysis upon in camera inspection, the Court\n\ndeclined to make such inspection or resolve the issue because it\n\nconcluded   that   Exemption    5   “plainly        applies”      to   the   legal\n\nanalysis that is sought here. See id.\n\n    The District Court then determined that section 6 of the CIA\n\nAct, 50 U.S.C. § 403g, now codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (2013),\n\nis an exempting statute within the meaning of Exemption 3 and\n\nthat section 6 protects from disclosure information concerning\n\nthe “functions” of CIA. See id. at 541.                Again, following the\n\ndistrict court decision in the Drone Strike Case, before it was\n\nreversed,   the    District    Court        here   ruled   that    Exemption    3\n\npermitted CIA, in response to ACLU’s request, to refuse to reveal\n\nthe existence of records concerning drone strikes.

These two,\n\nnumbered 9 and 10, were described as “Memorandum from Legal\n\nCounsel to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the National\n\nSecurity Legal Advisor with legal analysis regarding the effect\n\nof U.S. citizenship on targeting enemy belligerents.” JA 409.\n\n    With respect to the OLC-DOD Memorandum, the District Court,\n\naccepting N.Y.

Taking judicial notice of such statements is the same\ncourse taken by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in its\nrecent ACLU v. C.I.A. decision. 710 F.3d at 431. We conclude that it\nis the most sensible approach to ongoing disclosures by the Government\nmade in the midst of FOIA litigation.\n\n     Moreover, the Government’s request for an opportunity to submit\nnew material concerning public disclosures made after the District\nCourt’s decision was honored by affording the Government an\nopportunity, after oral argument, to submit such material ex parte for\nin camera inspection, which the Government has done.\n\n                                  25\n\fAfter the District Court entered judgment for the Defendants, one\n\ndocument and several statements of Government officials that the\n\nPlaintiffs   contend     support   their     claims        became    publicly\n\navailable.    The document is captioned “DOJ White Paper” and\n\ntitled “Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S.\n\nCitizen Who Is a Senior Operational Leader of Al-Qa’ida or an\n\nAssociated   Force”    (“DOJ   White    Paper”).      As    the     Government\n\nacknowledges, see Br. for Appellees at 25, the 16-page, single-\n\nspaced DOJ White Paper was leaked to the press and subsequently\n\nofficially disclosed by DOJ.10     The leak occurred on February 4,\n\n\n     10\n       The DOJ White Paper was leaked to Michael Isikoff, a reporter\nwith    NBC   News,    according    to   a    report   available    at\nhttp://nbcnews.to/U1ZII3; the text of the leaked document is available\nvia a link at that website. (Hard copies of the documents available\nat this and all other websites cited in this opinion, as well as\ncopies of videos available at websites cited in this opinion, to the\nextent they can be copied, have been docketed with the Clerk of Court\nfor public reference.) The official disclosure, acknowledged by the\nGovernment, see Br. for Appellees at 25, was made by OIP on Feb. 4,\n2013, in response to an FOIA request submitted by Truthout, according\nto a report available at http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/14585-\ntargeted-killing-white-paper-leaked-to-nbc-news-turned-over-to-\ntruthout-by-doj-in-response-to-a-six-month-old-foia-request-four-days-\nlater; the text of the officially disclosed document is available via\na     link      at      that      website        and     also       at\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/602342-draft-white-paper.html.\nThe document disclosed to Truthout is marked “draft”; the document\nleaked to Isikoff is not marked “draft” and is dated November 8, 2011.\nThe texts of the two documents are identical, except that the document\n\n                                   26\n\f2013; the official disclosure occurred four days later.\n\n     The statements are those of John O.          Brennan, Attorney\n\nGeneral Eric Holder, and President Obama.       Brennan, testifying\n\nbefore the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on February\n\n7, 2013, on his nomination to be director of CIA, said, among\n\nother things, “The Office of Legal Counsel advice establishes the\n\nlegal boundaries within which we can operate.” Open Hearing on\n\nthe Nomination of John O. Brennan to be Director of the Central\n\nIntelligence Agency Before the S. Select Comm. on Intelligence,\n\n\nleaked to Isikoff is not dated and not marked “draft.”\n\n     ACLU contends that DOJ did not release the DOJ White Paper in\nresponse to its FOIA request, nor list it on its Vaughn index. See Br.\nfor ACLU at 21 n.7. The Government responds that ACLU had narrowed\nits request to exclude “draft legal analyses,” Letter from Eric A.O.\nRuzicka to Sarah S. Normand (Apr. 3, 2012), and that the DOJ White\nPaper was “part of document number 60 on the Vaughn index submitted by\nthe Office of Legal Counsel as an attachment to a responsive e-mail.\nSee Br. for Appellees at 25 n.8. The OLC’s Vaughn index describes\ndocument number 60 as “E-mail circulating draft legal analysis\nregarding the application of domestic and international law to the use\nof lethal force in a foreign country against U.S. citizens in certain\ncircumstances, and discussion regarding interagency deliberations\nconcerning the same” and invokes Exemption 5.         Apparently, OLC\nexpected ACLU to understand “circulating” to mean “attachment.”\n\n     The Government offers no explanation as to why the identical text\nof the DOJ White Paper, not marked “draft,” obtained by Isikoff, was\nnot disclosed to ACLU, nor explain the discrepancy between the\ndescription of document number 60 and the title of the DOJ White\nPaper.\n\n                                  27\n\f113 Cong. 57 (Feb. 7, 2013) (“Brennan Hearing”), available at\n\nhttp://www.intelligence.senate.gov/130207/transcript.pdf.

The District Court ruled that no\n\nofficial disclosure had been made concerning documents containing\n\noperational details of targeted killings, sought by ACLU, see\n\nid., and that none of the public pronouncements cited by the\n\nPlaintiffs “reveals the necessary detailed legal analysis that\n\nsupports the Administration’s conclusion that targeted killing,\n\nwhether    of   citizens   or   otherwise,    is   lawful,”    id.   at   538\n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n       With respect to waiver of Exemption 5, the District Court\n\nruled that the deliberative process privilege had not been waived\n\nbecause “there is no evidence that the Government continually\n\n\n\n                                    34\n\frelied    upon   and   repeated    in   public   the    arguments    made\n\nspecifically in the OLC-DOD Memo,” id. at 549 (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that “it is\n\nsheer speculation that this particular OLC memorandum . . .\n\ncontains the legal analysis that justifies the Executive Branch’s\n\nconclusion that it is legal in certain circumstances to target\n\nsuspected terrorists, including United States citizens, for\n\nkilling away from a ‘hot’ field of battle,” id.           The Court saw\n\nno need to consider the plaintiffs’ claim of waiver in the\n\ncontext of the attorney-client privilege because the deliberative\n\nprocess   privilege    protected    the   OLC-DOD      Memorandum   under\n\nExemption 5.

Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 524.                   In a March 25, 2010,\n\nspeech    at    the   annual    meeting     of   the     American       Society   of\n\nInternational Law in Washington, D.C., then-Legal Adviser of the\n\nState    Department     Harold     Hongju    Koh    said,       “U.S.    targeting\n\npractices, including lethal operations conducted with the use of\n\nunmanned    aerial     vehicles,    comply       with    all    applicable    law,\n\nincluding the laws of war.” JA 113, 124.                In a February 22, 2012,\n\nspeech at the Yale Law School, Jeh Johnson, then-General Counsel\n\nof DOD, “summarize[d] . . . some of the basic legal principles\n\nthat form the basis for the U.S. military’s counterterrorism\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\fefforts against Al Qaeda and its associated forces,” JA 399, and\n\nreferring explicitly to “targeted killing,” said, “In an armed\n\nconflict, lethal force against known, individual members of the\n\nenemy is a long-standing and long-legal practice,” JA 402.\n\n    In a March 5, 2012, speech at Northwestern University,\n\nAttorney General Holder said, “[I]t is entirely lawful – under\n\nboth United States law and applicable law of war principles – to\n\ntarget specific senior operational leaders of al Qaeda and\n\nassociated forces.” JA 449. He discussed the relevance of the Due\n\nProcess Clause, id., and maintained that killing a senior al\n\nQaeda leader would be lawful at least in circumstances where\n\n    [f]irst, the U.S. government has determined, after a\n    thorough and careful review, that the individual poses\n    an imminent threat of violent attack against the United\n    States; second, capture is not feasible; and third, the\n    operation would be conducted in a manner consistent\n    with applicable law of war principles.\n\nJA 450.   Amplifying this last point, he stated that “use of\n\nlethal force by the United States will comply with the four\n\nfundamental law of war principles governing the use of force:\n\n. . . necessity[,] . . . distinction[,] . . . proportionality[,]\n\n. . . [and] humanity.” Id.    As the District Court noted, “The\n\n\n                               38\n\fNorthwestern Speech [by the Attorney General] discussed the legal\n\nconsiderations that the Executive Branch takes into consideration\n\nbefore targeting a suspected terrorist for killing” and “the\n\nspeech constitutes a sort of road map of the decision-making\n\nprocess that the Government goes through before deciding to\n\n‘terminate’ someone ‘with extreme prejudice.’” Dist.

Brennan, then-Assistant to the President\n\nfor Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, said, “Yes, in full\n\naccordance with the law, and in order to prevent terrorist\n\nattacks on the United States and to save American lives, the\n\nUnited States Government conducts drone strikes against specific\n\nal-Qaida terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft,\n\noften referred to publicly as drones.” JA 95.          On Feb. 7, 2013,\n\nBrennan, testifying on his nomination to be director of CIA,\n\nsaid, “The Office of Legal Counsel advice establishes the legal\n\nboundaries within which we can operate.” Brennan Hearing at 57.\n\n    Even   if   these   statements    assuring   the    public   of   the\n\n\n\n                                 39\n\flawfulness of targeted killings are not themselves sufficiently\n\ndetailed to establish waiver of the secrecy of the legal analysis\n\nin the OLC-DOD Memorandum, they establish the context in which\n\nthe most revealing document, disclosed after the District Court’s\n\ndecision, should be evaluated.        That document is the DOJ White\n\nPaper, officially released on Feb. 4, 2013. See note 9, above.\n\nBefore considering the relevance of the DOJ White Paper to the\n\nGovernment’s claim to continued secrecy and privilege of the\n\nlegal analysis in the OLC-DOD Memorandum, we describe that\n\nMemorandum, which we have examined in camera, in some detail.\n\n    The OLC-DOD Memorandum is a 41-page classified document,\n\ndated July 16, 2010, captioned:\n\n              MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n      Re: Applicability of Federal Criminal Laws and the\n                        Constitution to\nContemplated Lethal Operations Against Shykh Anwar al-Aulaki15\n\nIt was prepared on the letterhead of OLC and signed by David J.\n\nBarron, Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n    The   OLC-DOD   Memorandum   has    several   parts.   After   two\n\n\n    15\n        We have deleted classification codes from the caption and\nthroughout the document.\n\n                                 40\n\fintroductory paragraphs, Part I(A) reports intelligence that OLC\n\nhas received concerning the relationship between Al-Qaida in the\n\nArabian Peninsula (“AQAP”) and al-Qaida, the organization and\n\noperation of AQAP, and the role al-Awlaki performs with AQAP.\n\nParts I(B) and I(C) describe the manner in which government\n\nagencies would perform the targeted killing of al-Awlaki.                   Part\n\nII(A) considers Title 18 U.S.C. § 1119 (2013), entitled “Foreign\n\nmurder of United States nationals” and explains why section 1119\n\ndoes not proscribe killings covered by a traditionally recognized\n\njustification. Part II(B) explains why section 1119 incorporates\n\none such justification, the public authority justification. Part\n\nIII(A)     explains       why   the   public    authority      justification\n\nencompasses DOD’s role in the contemplated targeted killing, and\n\nPart III(B) explains why that justification encompasses another\n\nagency’s    role     in   the   killing.    Part      IV   explains   why   the\n\ncontemplated killing would not violate 18 U.S.C. § 956(a) (2013),\n\nentitled “Conspiracy to kill, maim, or injure persons or damage\n\nproperty    in   a   foreign    country.”      Part    V   explains   why    the\n\ncontemplated killing would not violate 18 U.S.C. § 2441 (2013),\n\n\n\n                                      41\n\fentitled “War crimes.”       Part VI explains why the contemplated\n\nkilling would not violate the Fourth or Fifth Amendments of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n    The     16-page,   single-spaced   DOJ      White   Paper   virtually\n\nparallels    the   OLC-DOD   Memorandum    in    its    analysis   of   the\n\nlawfulness of targeted killings.       Like the Memorandum, the DOJ\n\nWhite Paper explains why targeted killings do not violate 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1119 or 2441, or the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the\n\nConstitution, and includes an analysis of why section 1119\n\nencompasses the public authority justification.           Even though the\n\nDOJ White Paper does not discuss 18 U.S.C. § 956(a), which the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum considers, the substantial overlap in the\n\nlegal analyses in the two documents fully establishes that the\n\nGovernment may no longer validly claim that the legal analysis\n\nin the Memorandum is a secret.            After the District Court’s\n\ndecision, Attorney General Holder publicly acknowledged the close\n\nrelationship between the DOJ White Paper and previous OLC advice\n\non March 6, 2013, when he said at a hearing of the Senate\n\nCommittee on the Judiciary that the DOJ White Paper’s discussion\n\n\n\n                                  42\n\fof imminence of threatened action would be “more clear if it is\n\nread in conjunction with the underlying OLC advice.”16 Oversight\n\nof the U.S. Department of Justice Before the Senate Committee on\n\nthe Judiciary, 113th Cong. (Mar. 6, 2013).\n\n       After senior Government officials have assured the public\n\nthat        targeted    killings   are    “lawful”    and    that   OLC   advice\n\n“establishes the legal boundaries within which we can operate,”\n\nand the Government makes public a detailed analysis of nearly all\n\nthe legal reasoning contained in the OLC-DOD Memorandum, waiver\n\nof   secrecy      and    privilege   as   to   the   legal   analysis     in   the\n\nMemorandum has occurred.\n\n       The recent opinion of the District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of California, First Amendment Coalition v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Justice, No. 4:12-cv-01013-CW (N.D. Cal. April 11, 2014),\n\ndenying an FOIA request for the OLC-DOD Memorandum, is readily\n\ndistinguishable because the Court, being under the impression\n\nthat “there has been no ‘official disclosure’ of the White\n\nPaper,” id., slip op. at 24, did not assess its significance,\n\n       16\n       The statement was made in a response to a question from Senator\nMike Lee. A webcast of the hearing is available via a link at\nhttp://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=e0c4315749c1\n0b084028087a4aa80a73, at 1:51:30.\n\n                                          43\n\fwhereas in our case, the Government has conceded that the White\n\nPaper, with its detailed analysis of legal reasoning, has in fact\n\nbeen officially disclosed, see footnote 10, supra.\n\n    In resisting disclosure of the OLC-DOD Memorandum, the\n\nGovernment contends that making public the legal reasoning in the\n\ndocument will inhibit agencies throughout the Government from\n\nseeking OLC’s legal advice.        The argument proves too much.         If\n\nthis contention were upheld, waiver of privileges protecting\n\nlegal advice could never occur. In La Raza, we explained that\n\n“[l]ike the deliberative process privilege, the attorney-client\n\nprivilege may not be invoked to protect a document adopted as,\n\nor incorporated by reference into, an agency’s policy.” 411 F.3d\n\nat 360.   Here, the Government has done so by publicly asserting\n\nthat OLC advice “establishes the legal boundaries within which\n\nwe can operate”; it “cannot invoke that relied-upon authority and\n\nthen shield it from public view.”          Brennan Center, 697 F.3d at\n\n207-08.     Agencies     seeking    OLC     legal     advice    are   surely\n\nsophisticated   enough    to   know      that    in   these    circumstances\n\nattorney/client and deliberative process privileges can be waived\n\nand the advice publicly disclosed.              We need not fear that OLC\n\n\n                                    44\n\fwill lack for clients.\n\n    The   Government        also    argues      that   because     the    OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum    refers       to     earlier     OLC   documents      that    remain\n\nclassified, those assessing the legal reasoning in the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum    might    find       the   reasoning      deficient    without    an\n\nopportunity    to    see    the    previous     documents.         However,   the\n\nreasoning in the OLC-DOD Memorandum is rather elaborate, and\n\nreaders should have no difficulty assessing the reasoning on its\n\nown terms.    Moreover, the Government had no similar concern when\n\nit released the DOJ White Paper, the reasoning of which cannot\n\nbe properly assessed, on the Government’s argument, without\n\nseeing the OLC-DOD Memorandum.               Finally, the Government always\n\nhas the option of disclosing redacted versions of previous OLC\n\nadvice.\n\n    The loss of protection for the legal analysis in the OLC-DOD\n\nMemorandum does not mean, however, that the entire document must\n\nbe disclosed.       FOIA provides that “[a]ny reasonably segregable\n\nportion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting\n\nsuch record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\fthis subsection.” 5 U.S.C. § 552b.       The Government’s waiver\n\napplies only to the portions of the OLC-DOD Memorandum that\n\nexplain legal reasoning.   These are Parts II, III, IV, V, and VI\n\nof the document, and only these portions will be disclosed. Even\n\nwithin those portions of the document, there are matters that the\n\nGovernment contends should remain secret for reasons set forth\n\nin the Government’s classified ex parte submission, which we have\n\nreviewed in camera.\n\n    One of those reasons concerns [redacted] the Government\n\npersuasively argues warrants continued secrecy. [redacted]      We\n\nwill redact all references to that [redacted].17\n\n    Two arguments concern facts mentioned within the legal\n\nreasoning portions of the OLC-DOD Memorandum that no longer merit\n\nsecrecy.   One is the identity of the country in which al-Awlaki\n\nwas killed.   However, numerous statements by senior Government\n\nofficials identify that country as Yemen. On September 30, 2011,\n\nDOD released a transcript reporting then-Secretary of Defense\n\nPanetta stating, “[W]e’ve been working with the Yemenis over a\n\n\n    17\n       The redactions made in this paragraph implement section 2(a)\nof our order of May 28, 2014.\n\n                                46\n\flong period of time to be able to target Awlaki, and I want to\n\ncongratulate    them     on     their        efforts,   their    intelligence\n\nassistance, their operational assistance to get the job done.”\n\nJA 799.   On October 25, 2011, President Obama, appearing on a\n\nnetwork television program, said, referring to al-Awlaki, “[I]t\n\nwas important that, working with the [Yemenis,]18 we were able to\n\nremove him from the field.” Transcript of “The Tonight Show with\n\nJay Leno (Oct. 25, 2011). JA 556.                On the day al-Awlaki was\n\nkilled, September 3, 2011, DOD’s Armed Forces Press Service\n\nreported, “A U.S. airstrike that killed Yemeni-based terrorist\n\nAnwar al-Awlaki early this morning is a testament to the close\n\ncooperation    between    the    United        States   and   Yemen,   Defense\n\nSecretary Leon E. Panetta said today.” JA 651.                     The report\n\ncontinued, “Obama and Panetta congratulated the Yemenis on their\n\nintelligence   and     operational      assistance      in    targeting   [al-]\n\nAwlaki.” Id. It is no secret that al-Awlaki was killed in Yemen.\n\nHowever, the OLC-DOD Memorandum contains some references to the\n\nYemeni government that are entitled to secrecy and will be\n\n\n    18\n        The Tonight Show transcript erroneously rendered this word\n“enemies,” an error the Government acknowledged at oral argument.\n\n                                        47\n\fredacted.\n\n     The other fact within the legal reasoning portion of the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum that the Government contends merits secrecy\n\nis the identity of the agency, in addition to DOD, that had an\n\noperational role in the drone strike that killed al-Awlaki. Both\n\nfacts were deleted from the April 21 public opinion, but have\n\nbeen restored in this opinion.                Apparently not disputing that\n\nthis fact has been common knowledge for some time, the Government\n\nasserts the importance of concealing any official recognition of\n\nthe agency’s identity.           The argument comes too late.\n\n     A     March   18,   2010,    Wall    Street   Journal    article   quotes\n\nPanetta, then CIA Director:\n\n     “Anytime we get a high value target that is in the top\n     leadership of al Qaeda, it seriously disrupts their\n     operations,” Mr. Panetta said. “It sent two important\n     signals,” Mr. Panetta said. “No. 1 that we are not\n     going to hesitate to go after them wherever they try to\n     hide, and No. 2 that we are continuing to target their\n     leadership.”\n\n“Drone Kills Suspect in CIA Suicide Bombing,” The Wall Street\n\nJournal (Mar. 18, 2010).          Although the reference to “we” is not\n\nunequivocally to CIA and might arguably be taken as a reference\n\nto   the    Government    generally,      any    doubt   on   this   score   was\n\neliminated three months later.\n\n                                         48\n\f      In a June 27, 2010, interview with Jake Tapper of ABC News,\n\nPanetta said:\n\n      [W]e are engaged in the most aggressive operations in\n      the history of the CIA in that part of the world, and\n      the result is that we are disrupting their leadership.\n      We’ve taken down more than half of their Taliban\n      leadership, of their Al Qaida leadership.

Ct.\n\nOp., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 530.          Then, when asked about identifying\n\nfor   killing   a   person     who    has    been   identified     as   an    enemy\n\ncombatant, Panetta says, “It’s a recommendation we make, it’s a\n\nrecommendation the CIA director makes in my prior role . . . the\n\nPresident of the United States has to sign off.” Web Extra\n\np r e s e n t a t i o n ,                     a v a i l a b l e                a t\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7396830n, at 0:01, 2:30.\n\nCIA’s former director has publicly acknowledged CIA’s role in the\n\nkilling of al-Awlaki.\n\n      On February 7, 2014, Rep.

It is – you tell me if this is\n     correct – the administration’s policy that they are\n     exploring shifting the use of drones, unmanned aerial\n     vehicle strikes, from the CIA to the DOD.

But Gardels made it clear\n\nthat the justification must be “logical” and “plausible” “in\n\nprotecting our intelligence sources and methods from foreign\n\ndiscovery.” 689 F.2d at 1105.\n\n\n\n                                    51\n\f     The District Court noted the Government’s contention that\n\n“‘[i]t is entirely logical and plausible that the legal opinion\n\ncontains information pertaining to military plans, intelligence\n\nactivities, sources and methods, and foreign relations.’ (Gov’t\n\nMemo. in Opp’n/Reply 6).” Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 540.\n\nBut the Court then astutely observed, “[T]hat begs the question.\n\nIn   fact, legal analysis is not an ‘intelligence source or\n\nmethod.’” Id.\n\n     We recognize that in some circumstances the very fact that\n\nlegal analysis was given concerning a planned operation would\n\nrisk disclosure of the likelihood of that operation, but that is\n\nnot the situation here where drone strikes and targeted killings\n\nhave been publicly acknowledged at the highest levels of the\n\nGovernment.   We also recognize that in some circumstances legal\n\nanalysis   could   be   so   intertwined   with   facts   entitled   to\n\nprotection that disclosure of the analysis would disclose such\n\nfacts. Aware of that possibility, we have redacted, as explained\n\nabove, the entire section of the OLC-DOD Memorandum that includes\n\nany mention of intelligence gathering activities. The only other\n\n\n\n                                  52\n\ffacts mentioned in the pure legal analysis portions of the OLC-\n\nDOD Memorandum – the identification of the country where the\n\ndrone strike occurred and CIA’s role – have both already been\n\ndisclosed, also as explained above.            With respect to disclosure\n\nof CIA’s role, we can be confident that neither Senator Dianne\n\nFeinstein,    Chairman    of    the        Senate   Select   Committee     on\n\nIntelligence, nor Representative Mike Rogers, Chairman of the\n\nHouse    Select   Committee    on   Intelligence,      thought   they    were\n\nrevealing a secret when they publicly discussed CIA’s role in\n\ntargeted killings by drone strikes.19\n\n    The three-part test for “official” disclosure, relevant to\n\n\n\n    19\n       Although “the law will not infer official disclosure of\ninformation classified by the CIA from . . . release of\ninformation by another agency, or even by Congress,” Wilson, 586\nF.3d at 186-87, these members of Congress have made public\nstatements on this matter. Senator Feinstein has praised CIA for\nconducting drone strikes with less collateral damage than strikes\nconducted by the military. See “Senator Dianne Feinstein on\nDrones, Assault Weapons Ban,” The Takeaway (Mar. 20, 2013),\navailable at http:www.thetakeaway.org/story/276926-sen-dianne-\nfeinstein-drones-assault-weapons-ban/, at 2:00. Representative\nRogers told CBS that his committee has overseen CIA’s targeted\nkilling strikes “even before they conducted that first strike\nthat took [al-]Awlaki.” Transcript, Face the Nation, CBS News\n(Feb. 10, 2013), available at http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-\nthe-nation-transcripts-february-10-2013-graham-reed-and-\nrogers/4/.\n\n                                      53\n\fExemption 1, which the District Court took from Wilson, 586 F.3d\n\nat 536, has been sufficiently satisfied.      The legal analysis in\n\nthe OLC-DOD Memorandum is “‘as specific as the information\n\npreviously released’” in the DOJ White Paper, it “‘match[es] the\n\ninformation previously disclosed,’” and was “‘made public through\n\nan official and documented disclosure.’” Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F.3d\n\nat 536 (quoting Wilson, 586 F.3d at 186).          In reaching this\n\nconclusion, we do not understand the “matching” aspect of the\n\nWilson    test to require absolute identity.        Indeed, such a\n\nrequirement would make little sense. A FOIA requester would have\n\nlittle need for undisclosed information if it had to match\n\nprecisely information previously disclosed.20\n\n\n     20\n        Although we conclude that the three-part test of Wilson has\nbeen satisfied, and Wilson remains the law of this Circuit, we note\nthat a rigid application of it may not be warranted in view of its\nquestionable provenance. Wilson took the test from Wolf v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186834\"><a href=\"/opinion/186834/wolf-paul-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (D.C.

Cir. 1990). Fitzgibbon purported to find\nthe test in Afshar v. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415608\"><a href=\"/opinion/415608/nassar-afshar-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1133 (D.C. Cir.\n1983). The issue in Afshar was whether several books submitted to CIA\nfor clearance contained official disclosure of details of CIA’s\nrelationship with SAVAK, Iran’s intelligence service prior to 1979 and\nthe existence of a CIA station in Tehran prior to 1979.         Afshar\nrejected the claim of official disclosure for three reasons: (1) none\nof the books revealed a continuing relationship between CIA and SAVAK\nafter 1963, the date of the earliest withheld document; (2) the books\nprovided only a general outline of such a relationship; and (3) none\n\n                                  54\n\f     With the redactions and public disclosures discussed above,\n\nit is no longer either “logical” or “plausible” to maintain that\n\ndisclosure of the legal analysis in the OLC-DOD Memorandum risks\n\ndisclosing    any   aspect   of   “military    plans,   intelligence\n\nactivities, sources and methods, and foreign relations.”          The\n\nrelease of the DOJ White Paper, discussing why the targeted\n\nkilling of al-Awlaki would not violate several statutes, makes\n\nthis clear.   The additional discussion of 18 U.S.C. § 956(a) in\n\nthe OLC-DOD Memorandum adds nothing to the risk.             Whatever\n\n\n\nof the books was an official and documented disclosure. The second\nreason was supported by a citation to Lamont v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1688134\"><a href=\"/opinion/1688134/lamont-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 772 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), with a parenthetical stating that\nthe withheld information must have “already been specifically revealed\nto the public” (emphasis in Afshar). Lamont did not assert specific\nrevelation as a requirement for disclosure; it observed that the\nplaintiff had raised a factual issue as to whether the information\nsought had been specifically revealed. More important, Afshar, the\nultimate source of the three-part test, does not mention a requirement\nthat the information sought “match[es] the information previously\ndisclosed.”\n\n     Wilson also cited Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. v. Dep’t of\nthe Navy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533571\"><a href=\"/opinion/533571/hudson-river-sloop-clearwater-inc-the-sierra-club-inc-friends-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1989).         Clearwater also cited\nFitzgibbon and Afshar and drew from those opinions more rigidity than\nwas warranted. The issue in Clearwater was simply whether the Navy\nhad previously disclosed, as the plaintiff claimed, that it was\nplanning to deploy nuclear weapons at the New York Harbor Homeport.\nThe Court rejected the claim, pointing out that the Navy had said only\nthat the ships to be stationed at the Homeport were capable of\ncarrying nuclear weapons. See id. at 421.\n\n                                  55\n\fprotection the legal analysis might once have had has been lost\n\nby virtue of public statements of public officials at the highest\n\nlevels and official disclosure of the DOJ White Paper.\n\nIV. Legal Analysis in Other Withheld Documents21\n\n    In addition to seeking at least the legal analysis in the\n\nOLC-DOD Memorandum, ACLU also seeks disclosure of the legal\n\nanalysis in documents numbered 9 and 10 on DOD’s unclassified\n\nVaughn index and in other OLC legal memoranda the existence of\n\nwhich ACLU contends have been officially acknowledged in public\n\nstatements. See Br. for ACLU at 50.     ACLU contends that Senator\n\nFeinstein said at the confirmation hearing of Brennan to be CIA\n\ndirector that there are eleven such memoranda, see id. at 50\n\nn.25, of which four were provided to the Senate Select Committee\n\non Intelligence, see id. at 24 & n.9.\n\n\n     21\n       Other than the legal analysis in the documents considered in\nthis section, it is unclear whether the Appellants are seeking on\nappeal any other withheld documents. See, e.g., Br. for ACLU at 50\n(“Plaintiffs do not challenge the bulk of those withholdings.”). In\nany event, except as to the OLC-DOD Memorandum discussed in Section\nIII, above, the documents discussed in this Section IV, and the\nindices discussed in Section V, below, on the current record, we\naffirm the District Court’s decision to withhold all other documents\nsought. After the Government submits its classified Vaughn indices on\nremand, the District Court may, as appropriate, order the release of\nany documents that are not properly withheld.\n\n                                 56\n\f       Documents numbered 9 and 10 are DOD legal memoranda, which\n\nwere    made    available         to   this     Court      ex    parte    for    in    camera\n\ninspection.         As to these documents, we agree with the District\n\nCourt    that       the   declaration          of   Richard       C.    Gross,   Brigadier\n\nGeneral, United States Army, JA 863, adequately supports the\n\napplication of Exemption 5. See Dist. Ct.

Circuit that “[s]uch a response would only\n\nbe justified in unusual circumstances, and only by a particularly\n\npersuasive affidavit.” ACLU, 710 F.3d at 433.\n\n    The Government’s core argument to justify the Glomar and no\n\nnumber, no list responses, as it was with the effort to withhold\n\nthe OLC-DOD Memorandum, is that identification of any document\n\nthat provides legal advice to one or more agencies on the\n\nlegality      of    targeted    killings     “would      tend   to   disclose    the\n\nidentity of the agency or agencies that use targeted lethal force\n\nagainst certain terrorists who are U.S. citizens . . . .” Br. for\n\nAppellees      at    37.   If     one   of   those       agencies    is   CIA,   the\n\nGovernment’s argument continues, disclosure of any information\n\n\n\nGlomar to NYTimes;             no number, no list to       Glomar to NYTimes; no\nno number, no list to          Shane, Glomar to            number, no list to\nACLU as to classified          Savage, except OLC-         ACLU\ndocuments, except              DOD Memorandum; no\nOLC-DOD Memorandum             number, no list to\n                               ACLU as to classified\n                               documents, except\n                               OLC-DOD Memorandum\n\n\n                                        59\n\fin a Vaughn   index that “would tend to disclose the identity” of\n\nthat agency must be protected because, the Government claims,\n\n“[T]he government has never disclosed (with the exception of the\n\nBin Laden operation) whether the CIA has an operational role in\n\nthe use of targeted lethal force or is authorized to use such\n\nforce.”   Id. at 38.\n\n    As was true of waiver of privileges that might originally\n\nhave protected the legal reasoning in the OLC-DOD Memorandum, the\n\nstatements of Panetta when he was Director of CIA and later\n\nSecretary of Defense, set forth above, have already publicly\n\nidentified CIA as an agency that had an operational role in\n\ntargeted drone killings.23    With CIA identified, the Appellees’\n\nmain argument for the use of Glomar and no number, no list\n\nresponses evaporates.      The Vaughn index submitted by OLC in\n\ncamera must be disclosed, and DOD and CIA must submit classified\n\nVaughn indices to the District Court on remand for in camera\n\ninspection    and   determination    of   appropriate   disclosure   and\n\nappropriate redaction.\n\n    As was also true of the OLC-DOD Memorandum, however, the\n\nrequirement of disclosing the agencies’ Vaughn indices does not\n\n\n     23\n        For purposes of the issues on this appeal, it makes no\ndifference whether the drones were maneuvered by CIA or DOD personnel\nso long as CIA has been disclosed as having some operational role in\nthe drone strikes.\n\n                                    60\n\fnecessarily mean that either the number or the listing of all\n\ndocuments on those indices must be disclosed.                The Appellees\n\nargue persuasively that with respect to documents concerning a\n\ncontemplated military operation, disclosure of the number of such\n\ndocuments must remain secret because a large number might alert\n\nthe enemy to the need to increase efforts to defend against\n\nattacks or to avoid detection and a small number might encourage\n\na lessening of such efforts.           Accordingly, all listings after\n\nnumber 271 on OLC’s Vaughn index will remain secret. See Wilner,\n\n592 F.3d at 70 (upholding Glomar response as to identification\n\nof   documents    that    would   reveal   “details   of    [a]    program’s\n\noperations and scope”). The descriptions of listing numbers 1-4,\n\n6,   69,   72,   80-82,   87,   92,   103-04,   244-49,    and    256    reveal\n\ninformation entitled to be protected. Listing numbers 10-49, 51-\n\n56, 84-86, 94, 101, 106-09, 111-12, 114-15, 251, 255, 257-61, and\n\n266-67 describe email chains (or copies of chains).              Because the\n\nPlaintiffs informed the District Court that they were not seeking\n\nthese items, see Dist. Ct. Op., 915 F. Supp. 2d at 545, these\n\nlistings need not be disclosed.\n\n     No reason appears why the number, title, or description of\n\nthe remaining listed documents needs to be kept secret.                 Listing\n\nnumber 5 is the OLC-DOD Memorandum; listing numbers 7-9, 50, 250,\n\n262-65,    and   269-71    describe    documents    and    attorney       notes\n\n                                      61\n\fconcerning legal advice; listing numbers 57-68, 70-71, 73-79, 83,\n\n88-91, 93, 95-100, 102, 105, 110, 113, 116-22, and 144-45 are\n\ndescribed as including factual information concerning al-Awlaki;\n\nlisting numbers 123-30 are described as unclassified open source\n\nmaterials; listing numbers 131-43 and 148-237 are described as\n\ndrafts of the OLC-DOD Memorandum; listing numbers 238-43 are\n\ndescribed as drafts of other documents; listing numbers 146-47\n\nare described as drafts of Document 86A, a listing that does not\n\nappear on the OLC’s Vaughn index; and listing numbers 244, 246,\n\n248, 252-54, 256, and 268 are described as including [redacted]24.\n\n    Some, perhaps all, of the information in many of these\n\ndocuments         might    be       protected   as   classified     intelligence\n\ninformation or predecisional.               If the Plaintiffs challenge the\n\napplicability of a cited exemption, the District Court, after in\n\ncamera inspection, will be able to determine which of these\n\ndocuments need to be withheld and which portions of these\n\ndocuments        need     to   be    redacted   as   subject   to   one   or   more\n\nexemptions that have not been waived.                 At this stage, we decide\n\nonly that the number, title, and description of all documents\n\nlisted on OLC’s classified Vaughn index must be disclosed, with\n\nthe exception of listing numbers 1-4, 6, 69, 72, 80-82, 87, 92,\n\n\n        24\n             This redaction implements section 2(a) of our order of May 28,\n2014.\n\n                                           62\n\f103-04, 244-49; 10-49, 51-56, 84-86, 94, 101, 106-09, 111-12,\n\n114-15, 251, 252-54, 255-61, 266-67, 268; and all listings after\n\nlisting number 271.\n\n    Unlike OLC, DOD and CIA did not provide this Court with\n\nclassified Vaughn indices, and we are unable to distinguish among\n\nlisted document numbers, which titles or descriptions merit\n\nsecrecy. We will therefore direct that, upon remand, DOD and CIA\n\nwill provide the District Court with classified Vaughn indices\n\nlisting documents responsive to the Plaintiffs’ requests.          From\n\nthese indices, the District Court, with the guidance provided by\n\nthis opinion, should have little difficulty, after examining\n\nwhatever further affidavits DOD and CIA care to submit to claim\n\nprotection of specific listings, to determine which listings on\n\nthese indices may be disclosed.          See ACLU, 710 F.3d at 432\n\n(prescribing   a   similar   procedure   after   rejecting   a   Glomar\n\nresponse).\n\nVI. Adequacy of OIP’s Search\n\n    Finally, ACLU argues that OIP did not make an adequate\n\nsearch because it did not disclose thirty e-mail chains with\n\nother   DOJ offices that were found during OLC’s search for\n\nresponsive records.    See Br. for ACLU at 60.      However, as this\n\nCourt has recognized, a search is not inadequate merely because\n\n                                  63\n\fit does not identify all responsive records.

Cuomo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761233\"><a href=\"/opinion/761233/grand-central-partnership-inc-v-andrew-cuomo-as-secretary-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\nThe adequacy of a search is not measured by its results, but\n\nrather by its method.

Cir. 1984).         To show that a search is\n\nadequate, the agency affidavit “must be relatively detailed and\n\nnonconclusory,   and   submitted   in   good   faith.”   Grand   Central\n\nPartnership, 166 F.3d at 489 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe affidavit submitted by an OIP official, JA 412-419 ¶¶ 7-34,\n\neasily meets these requirements, and the November 3, 2011, cut-\n\noff date was reasonable as the date on which the search was\n\ncommenced.
