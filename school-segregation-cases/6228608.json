Ct. No. CGC11509240)\n        Defendants and Appellants.\n\n\n        Police officer trainee Bret Cornell, while off-duty and in street clothes, went for a\nrun one morning in Golden Gate Park, stopping for a brief rest on a knoll called Hippie\nHill. Two uniformed patrol officers in the area spotted him, thought he looked\n“worried,” and grew suspicious because the bushes on Hippie Hill are known for illicit\ndrug activity. As the patrolmen began to approach Cornell, but before they reached him\nor said anything to him, he resumed his run. The officers gave chase, joined in pursuit by\ntwo other officers who responded to a call for backup. One of the officers, with his gun\ndrawn, eventually caught up to Cornell on a trail in some nearby woods.\n        Cornell claims he had no idea he was being chased or that the officers wished to\nspeak with him. On the trail, he says he heard a shout from behind, “I will shoot you,”\nand looked over his shoulder to see a dark figure pointing a gun at him. He darted away,\nultimately finding what he thought was refuge with a police officer awaiting his arrival\nsome distance away at the top of a stairway in AIDS Memorial Grove. But to his surprise\nwhen he arrived there, that officer ordered him to the ground. He was arrested at gun-\npoint and searched, taken in handcuffs to a stationhouse for interrogation, and eventually\nto a hospital for a drug test, which was negative.\n\n                                               1\n\f       In the meantime, a team of officers went back to Golden Gate Park, spoke to\npeople who had seen Cornell that morning, and conducted a search of the areas where he\nwas known to have been, and of his parked truck. No evidence of involvement with\ndrugs turned up, and after nearly six hours in custody, Cornell was released. As he was\nleaving the stationhouse, he was given a criminal citation for evading arrest in violation\nof Penal Code section 148. Other than cursory questioning by the officers who issued the\ncitation, no one in a position of higher authority ever interviewed him or asked for his\nside of the story. Cornell was never prosecuted, but he lost his job as a result of the arrest\nand citation.\n       To recover for the damage done to him, Cornell sued the four arresting officers,\nthe Chief of Police, and the City and County of San Francisco. Following phase one of a\nbifurcated jury trial on special verdict forms, the trial court, relying on findings of fact by\nthe jury in the initial phase, determined that Cornell was arrested without probable cause,\nthereby establishing liability for false arrest, and prompting the defense to stipulate to\nliability for negligence. In phase two, the jury returned a verdict for Cornell on two\nremaining claims, tortious interference with economic advantage, and violation of Civil\nCode section 52.1 (Section 52.1), awarding total damages of $575,231. Following trial,\nthe court added $2,027,612.75 in attorney’s fees and costs on the Section 52.1 claim.\n       These consolidated appeals are from the ensuing judgment and the award of\nattorney’s fees and costs. The appellants argue 1) as a matter of law, the jury’s phase one\nfindings do not support the trial court’s determination that probable cause was lacking,\n2) the trial court should have declared a mistrial when the jury deadlocked on one of 18\nquestions put to it in the phase one special verdict form, 3) the trial court failed to address\ntheir argument that, under Penal Code section 847, subdivision (b), they are immune from\nclaims for false arrest, and 4) even if the verdict on the tort claims is upheld, the Section\n52.1 verdict and accompanying award of fees and costs must be reversed because there\nwas insufficient evidence to submit that claim to the jury.\n       Seeing no error, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f                                   I.   BACKGROUND\n       A.     The Evidence at Trial\n       In July 2010, Bret Cornell, a recent graduate of the police academy employed by\nthe San Francisco Police Department as a field officer trainee, went for a morning jog in\nGolden Gate Park at around 7:00 a.m., after finishing a night shift. He was dressed in\ngray canvas pants cut off at mid-ankle, a plaid fleece jacket over a dark t-shirt, and\nrunning shoes. After running a considerable distance, at around 8:00 a.m., he ran across\nSharon Meadow and stopped to rest at the top of Hippie Hill, just as a police cruiser\ndrove through the trees up to the crest of the hill along a pedestrian pathway. He looked\nat the car, and not wanting to interfere with whatever the officers were doing, walked\ndown to the bottom of the hill.1\n       The two uniformed officers in the cruiser, David Brandt and Richard “Brett”\nBodisco, considered Hippie Hill to be a high crime area. Both officers had made\nnumerous narcotics arrests there, mostly involving drug transactions in the bushes, and\nthere had been a homicide in the park a few days earlier. According to Officers Brandt\nand Bodisco, they drove up the pathway to gauge the reaction of people on the other side\nof the crest who could not see them coming. Cornell, a stranger to the officers, glanced at\ntheir car when they came into view, and then looked away. Cornell was by himself, not\ntalking to anyone, had nothing in his hands, and was not doing anything specific to\narouse suspicion. Officer Brandt described Cornell as having a “clean-cut” look, which\nhe said was consistent with someone who was a recent parolee.2 Because Cornell\n\n       1\n         Cornell testified that when he saw the officers’ car, he thought it “odd” they were\ndriving on a pedestrian path, “figured . . . they were doing some kind of official\noperation,” and wanted to avoid them because “I didn’t need to get myself involved in\nany official operations” while off-duty. He explained that “in field training we are not\nallowed to have any off-duty contact. We are not supposed to be getting involved in\nofficial police matters if we can avoid it.”\n       2\n        On cross-examination, Officer Brandt admitted Cornell’s appearance was also\nconsistent with that of a recent graduate of the police academy.\n\n                                              3\n\fappeared to be “worried” in their presence, Officers Brandt and Bodisco turned their car\ntoward him and decided to initiate a consensual encounter. They did not activate their\nlights, or say anything to him over their loudspeaker.\n       As the officers turned toward Cornell, and as he walked away from them, headed\ndownhill, he looked back briefly in their direction and then began running. With their\nsuspicions aroused, the officers decided to chase Cornell and detain him. Officer\nBodisco jumped out of the car and made a radio call for backup to assist in setting up a\nperimeter to cut Cornell off from any escape. The call, which drew the assistance of two\nmore uniformed officers, Jesse Farrell and Sergeant Wallace Gin, included a description\nof Cornell and the direction he was headed, but no other details. When Officer Bodisco’s\ncall for backup went out, the police dispatcher asked “What’s the want?” Officer\nBodisco responded, simply, “[R]unning.” According to Officer Brandt, the call gave no\nspecifics because at that point “we didn’t have anything specific.” Surveying the area\nfrom the top of the hill to see where Cornell went, Officer Bodisco testified he saw\nCornell go off path through some bushes, reappearing below the hill without his plaid\njacket and wearing only a dark shirt, which the officers took to be an attempt to throw\nthem off his track.\n       When Cornell left Hippie Hill, he was unaware the officers wanted him to stop.\nHis explanation for discarding his fleece jacket was that, after an hour’s run, he was\nfeeling hot. Having unsuccessfully tried to tie his fleece jacket around his waist while\nrunning at an earlier point on his route, he folded it and placed it on a tree stump to\nretrieve later. He said he had done that before and had no problem with anyone taking it,\nand even if someone did take it, the garment was inexpensive and easily replaceable.\nOnce the officers caught sight of Cornell from their vantage point on Hippie Hill, Officer\nBodisco set out after him on foot. Officer Brandt, still in the cruiser, drove down and\naround the hill, past some tennis courts, and along nearby Bowling Green Drive. As he\ndrove, Officer Brandt stopped to ask two people along the way if they had seen someone\n\n\n                                              4\n\fmatching Cornell’s description; one person claimed to have seen someone running near\nthe tennis courts, and another said he had heard some rustling in bushes up a winding dirt\ntrail nearby.\n       Continuing in the direction these park users pointed out, Officer Brandt’s search\ntook him to the bottom of a trail known as the High Path, a dirt pathway lined on both\nsides by trees and brush, leading up a hill beyond Bowling Green Drive at the entrance to\nthe AIDS Memorial Grove. Officer Farrell arrived and joined Officer Brandt at the\nbottom of the High Path, and the two of them began proceeding up the trail, with Officer\nBrandt in the lead. Officer Brandt described the trail as dark and having a “cave[-like]\nappearance.” He unholstered his gun at this point and held it in a “low ready” position,\nnot because of any specific threat, but because of “fear of the unknown.” Officer Farrell,\nfor his part, perceiving no threat, left his gun holstered.\n       Officer Brandt caught sight of Cornell walking up ahead and eventually came\nclose enough to confront him. Officer Farrell was directly behind Officer Brandt, could\nsee that Cornell appeared to be “clean cut,” was not armed, had nothing in his hands, and\nwas doing nothing threatening. Officer Brandt shouted something at Cornell. Both\nofficers recall Officer Brandt unmistakably ordering Cornell to stop at that point,3\ncausing Cornell to pause, half turn in their direction, look at them squarely, and then dash\naway at full speed, taking a route downhill through the trees in a clear effort to evade\ncapture.\n       Cornell—who testified he still had no idea he was being pursued by police officers\nduring the encounter on the High Path—said he heard a “disturbance” behind him and\nthen heard the words “I will shoot you,” which prompted him to glance over his shoulder\nand see a dark figure pointing a gun. He said he took off sprinting in desperate flight\n       3\n         What exactly Officer Brandt shouted was disputed (Officer Brandt—“stop[,]\npolice”; Farrell—“some sort of command,” cannot recall exact words; Cornell—“I will\nshoot you,” and did not think whoever said it was a police officer because “I will shoot\nyou” is not an appropriate police command), but there is no dispute he yelled at least the\nwords “I will shoot you.”\n\n                                               5\n\ffrom an unknown, armed attacker, and then tripped and fell down a steeply pitched slope\nthrough some trees, tumbling into the AIDS Memorial Grove. Standing at the top of a\nstairway across the meadow from where Cornell landed was Sergeant Gin. Cornell began\nto run toward the stairway, thinking he had found protection from the unknown assailant\nwho had just accosted him on the High Path. To Cornell’s surprise when he reached the\nbottom of the stairway, Sergeant Gin ordered him to stop and put his hands up.\n       At this point, Cornell surrendered without any protest or struggle. He raised his\nhands as directed, but Sergeant Gin testified that as Cornell began walking up the stairs\nhe lowered his right hand to shoulder height, at which point Sergeant Gin drew his gun\nand ordered him to the ground. Cornell again complied. As he lay prone on the steps,\nOfficers Bodisco, Brandt and Farrell arrived, and Officer Bodisco handcuffed him, with\nthe cuffs binding his hands behind his back. Cornell remained cooperative and compliant\nthroughout the handcuffing process.\n       Upon being handcuffed, Cornell was not advised he was under arrest or the basis\nof the arrest. None of the officers dispute, however, that he was under arrest. Having\nmade the arrest, the officers conducted a full search incident-to-arrest. The search turned\nup nothing except Cornell’s police identification and a standard-issue set of handcuffs in\nhis back pocket. It was not until this point—some seven minutes after the initial\nencounter on Hippie Hill—that Cornell told the arresting officers he was a police officer\nand that he was just out for a run. When asked where his gun was, Cornell said it was in\nhis truck, which was parked near Stowe Lake. Sergeant Gin decided at this point to take\nCornell to Park Station for further interrogation. Cornell was then escorted up the steps\nand loaded into the back of a transport wagon, still bound in handcuffs behind his back.\n       As Cornell was being driven to Park Station, he began to feel light-headed, had\ntrouble breathing, and he requested a double set of handcuffs to relieve discomfort. He\nrepeatedly asked the driver for assistance, but was ignored. After the transport wagon\nleft, headed for Park Station, several officers conducted a search in Golden Gate Park,\n\n\n                                             6\n\flooking for incriminating evidence. They found Cornell’s plaid jacket discarded in the\nbushes, but there was nothing in it. They also located Cornell’s truck, which was parked\non Conservatory Drive, some distance from Stowe Lake where Cornell said he parked it;\nhis gun was inside, where he had indicated it could be found.\n       Upon arrival at Park Station, Cornell still had not been told why he was under\narrest. Officers Bodisco and Brandt surreptitiously recorded an interview of him and\nduring the questioning Officer Brandt told Cornell “[y]ou’re going to end up hanging\nyourself pretty hard by lying. I can tell you that right now.” Cornell’s repeated question,\n“What’s the charge?,” went unanswered. Responding to Cornell’s insistence that he had\nbeen unaware he was being pursued by police and that no officer ever issued a command\nto stop running, Officer Brandt accused him of being a “professional”—meaning\nsomeone who has an “extensive history of criminal misconduct” who seeks to “work the\nsystem for their benefit”—and brushed off Cornell’s denial of wrongdoing with the\ncomment, “you can talk to them downtown.”\n       While held in custody at Park Station, Cornell was handcuffed to a bench in full\nview of many officers, the “entire watch” as he put it, and he overheard several of them\nchuckling about him being a field officer trainee, which elicited comments such as “not\nanymore” and “another one bites the dust.” Cornell continued to report being in physical\ndistress while at Park Station, so paramedics were called, and he was taken to a hospital.\nIn the ambulance, while the paramedics were taking Cornell to the hospital, Officer\nBrandt arranged to place a hidden audio recording device near him, “because [he] might\nsay something stupid.” The recording captured nothing incriminating. At the hospital, a\nsample of Cornell’s blood was taken and tested for the presence of narcotics. The blood\ndraw was negative.\n       Upon receiving medical clearance at the hospital, Cornell was returned to Park\nStation, where he was eventually released at 1:50 p.m., after nearly six hours in custody.\nWhile processing him for release, Officer Brandt said to Cornell “you know the drill” and\n\n\n                                             7\n\fhanded him a misdemeanor citation accusing him of violating Penal Code section 148,\nsubdivision (a), for resisting or delaying an officer in the course of his duties. The\ncitation, signed by Officer Bodisco, and approved by Sergeant Gin, specified Hippie Hill\nas the location of the offense. No criminal charges were ever brought, but two days later,\npursuant to a policy requiring termination for misconduct of any officer trainee—trainees\nare probationary employees—the San Francisco Police Department summarily released\nCornell from its employ, ending his career as a San Francisco police officer and\neffectively disqualifying him from obtaining a law enforcement position with other\ndepartments or agencies.\n       B.     Claims and Trial Proceedings\n       Cornell brought this action against Officers Brandt, Bodisco and Farrell, Sergeant\nGin, San Francisco Police Chief George Gascon, and the City and County of San\nFrancisco (the City). In his complaint, as amended, he pleaded claims for violation of\nSection 52.1, negligence, assault and battery, false arrest and imprisonment, and tortious\ninterference with contract and/or economic advantage.4 The remaining defendants at\ntrial—and the appellants here—were Officer Brandt, Officer Bodisco, Officer Farrell,\nSergeant Gin, and the City.\n       The case was tried to a jury over the course of 23 trial days in October and\nNovember 2013. At the close of the evidence, jury deliberations were bifurcated into two\nphases, with the first phase addressing the claims of assault and false arrest. A special\nverdict form for Phase I presented a series of 18 questions, beginning with a question\nasking the jury to decide whether Cornell had proved his assault claim, followed by a\n\n       4\n          Prior to trial, the court granted summary judgment to Chief Gascon because there\nwas no evidence of his personal involvement in the alleged acts giving rise to liability. It\ninitially granted summary adjudication to all defendants on Cornell’s Section 52.1 claim,\nbut due to an intervening change in the applicable law, reconsidered that ruling and\ngranted Cornell leave to amend, resulting in a second amended complaint upon which the\ncase was tried.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fseries of 17 factual questions pertinent to the legal issue of probable cause to arrest.5 The\ncourt adopted this bifurcated mode of submitting the case to the jury based on the\nexpectation that the Phase I findings would dictate what, if anything, remained to be\ndecided in Phase II.\n       After a day and a half of Phase I deliberations, the jury reported being “hopelessly\nstuck” on two of the questions submitted to it. The court admonished the jury to keep\ntrying. Late that afternoon, a Friday, the jury again reported it was still stuck on two\nquestions, this time adding that there was “no other testimony or evidence that will\nchange any of our minds.” With the jury at an impasse, the court recessed for the\nweekend, after first excusing a juror who had a schedule conflict and substituting an\n\n\n       5\n          The specific questions, crafted jointly by the parties with input from the court,\nwere as follows: (1) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant\nassaulted plaintiff? (2) Did either or both Officer Brandt or Bodisco see Cornell running\nacross Sharon Meadow before they saw him on Hippie Hill? (3) Was Hippie Hill known\nto Officer Brandt and Bodisco as a high crime area? (4) Was it reasonable for the officers\nto believe that Cornell had come out of the bushes on Hippie Hill? (5) Did the officers\nhave knowledge of the types of criminal activity in the Hippie Hill area that could lead\nthem to believe that Cornell may be involved in criminal activity near Hippie Hill?\n(6) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell appeared nervous or evasive on\nHippie Hill because of the presence of the officers? (7) Did the officers do or say\nanything on Hippie Hill that would have communicated to Cornell that they wanted to\ncontact him? (8) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell fled from them on\nHippie Hill? (9) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell removed his jacket to\nchange his appearance in order to avoid detention? (10) Did the officers observe Cornell\nrun off trail through the bushes? (11) Were Officer Brandt’s only words said to Cornell,\n“I will shoot you!”? (12) Did Officer Brandt or Farrell do or say anything on the path\nabove the AIDS Memorial Grove that would have communicated to Cornell that they\nwanted him to stop? (13) Did the officers see Cornell glance back on the path above the\nAIDS Memorial Grove? (14) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell knew or\nshould have known that they were police officers? (15) Did Officer Farrell see Officer\nBrandt pointing his gun in Cornell’s direction? (16) Would an objectively reasonable\nofficer believe that Cornell ran away from Officer Brandt in order to resist the use of\nunreasonable force? (17) Did Cornell go down the hill into the Grove accidentally or\nintentionally? (18) Was it reasonable for the officers to believe that Cornell went down\nthe hill into the Grove with the intent of evading them?\n\n\n                                              9\n\falternate juror. The reconstituted jury began deliberations anew the following week, but\nafter two additional days of deliberating, remained hung, though on only one question.\nThe court decided to take the Phase I verdict at that point despite the unanswered\nquestion, over an objection from the defense.6\n       In its Phase I verdict, the jury found unambiguously for the appellants on the\nassault claim. Beyond that, however, the results were mixed, with some findings tending\nto favor the officers’ version of events, and some findings tending to favor Cornell’s\nversion. In the findings favorable to Cornell, the jury found that Officers Brandt and\nBodisco never said anything or otherwise communicated to Cornell their desire to speak\nto him on Hippie Hill; that it was not reasonable for them to believe Cornell had come\nout of the bushes on Hippie Hill; and that, contrary to Officer Bodisco’s testimony, they\ndid not see Cornell run off trail through the bushes when he left Hippie Hill. The jury\ndeadlocked on the question whether it was reasonable for Officers Brandt and Bodisco to\nbelieve Cornell fled from them on Hippie Hill.\n       In the findings favoring the defense, on the other hand, the jury found that Officers\nBodisco and Brandt considered Hippie Hill to be a high crime area; that the officers’\nknowledge of the types of crimes committed there “could lead them to suspect” Cornell\nmay have been engaged in criminal activity; that the officers reasonably believed that\nCornell appeared “nervous or evasive” when he saw them; that they reasonably believed\nCornell shed his jacket in an effort to avoid being detected; that when Officers Brandt\nand Farrell encountered Cornell on the High Path, they reasonably believed he knew they\nwere police officers; that a reasonable officer would not have believed Cornell was\nfleeing from the use of unreasonable force against him by Officer Brandt; that, contrary\n\n\n       6\n         Defense counsel objected “for the record” to this procedure and insisted upon\nanswers to all of the Phase I special verdict questions. In a colloquy with the court when\nthe jury first reported an impasse on November 8, counsel had previously taken the\nposition the court had discretion to decide “what facts the Court needs to make” a\nprobable cause determination.\n\n                                            10\n\fto Cornell’s testimony, he went down the hill from the High Path into the AIDS\nMemorial Grove intentionally, not accidentally; and that it was reasonable for the officers\nto believe he was trying to evade capture in doing so.\n         Based on the jury’s Phase I findings, the court ruled as a matter of law that\ndefendants did not have reasonable suspicion to detain Cornell and that he was arrested\nwithout probable cause. In the hiatus between Phases I and II, the defense stipulated to\nliability on the part of all defendants on the negligence claim, leaving only the tortious\ninterference with economic advantage claim and the Section 52.1 claim for decision in\nPhase II. Moving on to the next phase of the jury deliberations, the court posed a series\nof Phase II questions pertaining to these two claims and to issues of causation and\ndamages on all claims. With liability for false arrest and negligence established in Phase\nI, the jury returned a Phase II special verdict finding liability on the tortious interference\nand Section 52.1 claims,7 awarding total damages of $575,231, including $234,007 in\npast economic damages, $266,224 in future economic damages, and $75,000 in past non-\neconomic damages, with judgment entered accordingly.8 The court then granted\nCornell’s motion to tax costs, awarding him $2,027,612.75 in attorney’s fees under\nSection 52.1.\n         These timely appeals followed, from the judgment and from the attorney’s fee\naward.\n\n\n\n\n         8\n         In the Phase II verdicts, the jury found liability against only Officers Brandt and\nBodisco on the intentional interference claim and against only Officer Brandt and\nSergeant Gin on the Section 52.1 claim. Based on the verdicts for Phase I and Phase II\nand on the stipulation by all appellants to liability for negligence, judgment was entered\nagainst all appellants on the false arrest claim and the negligence claim, against Officer\nBrandt, Sergeant Gin and the City on the Section 52.1 claim, against Officers Brandt and\nBodisco on the intentional interference with economic relations claim, and in favor of all\nappellants on the assault claim. The judgment awards the total damages jointly and\nseverally against all appellants.\n\n                                              11\n\f                                    II.     DISCUSSION\n       A.      Probable Cause to Arrest\n\n       Where the facts are not in conflict, the issue of probable cause is a question of law\nreviewable de novo on appeal. (Giannis v. City and County of San Francisco (1978) 78\nCal.App.3d 219, 225; People v. Tyler (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 728, 735.) We look to\nwhether facts known to the arresting officer “at the moment the arrest was made” (Beck v.\nOhio (1964) 379 U.S. 89, 90) “ ‘would persuade someone of “reasonable caution” that\nthe person to be arrested has committed a crime.’ ” (People v. Zaragoza (2016) 1 Cal.5th\n21, 57; see Dunaway v. New York (1979) 442 U.S. 200, 208, fn. 9.) “The rule of probable\ncause is a practical, nontechnical conception” that turns on an assessment of the facts\ngathered by the arresting officer in the field (Brinegar v. United States (1949) 338 U.S.\n160, 176) and is not governed by courtroom standards of proof. (Ibid.) Many verbal\nformulae have been used to describe it, but distilled to their essence “ ‘[t]he substance of\nall the definitions . . . is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt’ ” (id. at p. 175), where the\nbelief is “particularized with respect to the person to be . . . seized.” (People v.\nThompson (2006) 38 Cal.4th 811, 818.)\n       The legal standard we apply to assess probable cause is an objective one in which\nthe subjective motivations of the arresting officers have no role. (Whren v. United States\n(1996) 517 U.S. 806, 813; Gillan v. City of San Marino (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1033,\n1045 (Gillan); Johnson v. Lewis (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 443, 454.) But it is an\noverstatement to say that what is in the mind of an arresting officer is wholly irrelevant,\nfor the objective test of reasonableness is simply a measure by which we assess whether\nthe circumstances as subjectively perceived by the officer provide a reasonable basis for\nthe seizure. (Agar v. Superior Court (1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 24, 29; see Devenpeck v.\nAlford (2004) 543 U.S. 146, 153.)\n       Of course, temporary detention on grounds short of probable cause is also\nconstitutionally permissible in some circumstances. (Terry v. Ohio (1968) 392 U.S. 1,\n20–21, 27.) A “brief, investigatory stop” is justified where an officer has “reasonable,\narticulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot,” implicating the suspect. (Illinois v.\n\n                                               12\n\fWardlow (2000) 528 U.S. 119, 123 (Wardlow); see In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888,\n893.) While the more demanding standard of probable cause requires a basis to suspect\nsomeone of having committed a particular crime, reasonable suspicion to detain only\nrequires facts connecting the suspect to “criminal activity” more generally. (People v.\nCampbell (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 588, 594.) Like the probable cause determination, the\napplicable test courts use to assess reasonable suspicion is an objective one, specific to\nthe detainee. (People v. Perrusquia (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 228, 233.)\n       Our Supreme Court recently explained that “ ‘[a] detention is reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable facts that,\nconsidered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective\nmanifestation that the person detained may be involved in criminal activity.’ [Citation.]\nSuch reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on factors unrelated to the defendant,\nsuch as criminal activity in the area.” (People v. Casares (2016) 62 Cal.4th 808, 837–\n838 (Casares).) Reasonable suspicion must rest on objective particulars tying a\nparticular person to criminal activity, rather than on a mere “hunch” that something is\nodd or unusual about the person detained. (Id. at p. 838; see People v. Bower (1979) 24\nCal.3d 638, 647 [officer’s suspicions about white man found late at night in a “high\ncrime,” largely black neighborhood insufficient to justify detention where the officer\ntestified he had never seen a white person in that area at that time “for an innocent\npurpose”].)\n       Cornell was arrested for the offense of “willfully resist[ing], delay[ing], or\nobstruct[ing] [a] . . . peace officer . . . in the discharge . . . [of a] duty of his or her office”\nunder Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a). To violate this statute, the obstructive\nconduct must impede the lawful performance of an officer’s duty. (People v. Curtis\n(1969) 70 Cal.2d 347, 354; People v. Rodriguez (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1543.)\nThus, the analysis here focuses, at its core, on whether there was reasonable suspicion\njustifying Cornell’s detention at any point between the time he was spotted on Hippie Hill\nand the time he was arrested in AIDS Memorial Grove. If there was not, Officers Brandt\nand Bodisco—and their fellow officers, since all of the officers involved in pursuing\nCornell constructively shared the same pool of information under the collective\n\n                                                 13\n\fknowledge doctrine9—were acting outside the lawful course of their duties when they\nsought to detain him. That analysis drives the probable cause analysis, for if there was no\nobjectively reasonable basis to believe Cornell had violated Penal Code section 148,\nsubdivision (a) or any other law, probable cause to arrest was lacking as well. (Casares,\nsupra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 838 [“The detention being unlawful, the subsequent searches of\ndefendant’s person and the car he had been sitting in were also unlawful.”].)\n       We agree with the trial court that there was no reasonable suspicion to detain and\nhence no probable cause to arrest. This incident took place in broad daylight in one of\nthe most heavily used public recreation areas in San Francisco. The jury found that when\nthe chase commenced, Officers Brandt and Bodisco knew little more than that they had\nseen Cornell at a location where drug crimes often took place, but with nothing\nconnecting him to any criminal activity. The man had nothing in his hands, made no\nfurtive movements, and was speaking to no one. Nothing about the way he was dressed\nindicated he might be hiding something under his clothing, and Officers Brandt and\nBodisco gave him no directions that he disobeyed. (See Casares, supra, 62 Cal.4th at\np. 838 [“[officer] described no furtive movement or other behavior by defendant\nsuggestive of criminal activity”].) They did not claim they recognized Cornell as\nsomeone with previous involvement in criminal activity. They had no tip that a drug\ntransaction was about to take place in which he fit the description of someone likely to be\ninvolved. And they saw no activity on Hippie Hill, by anyone, indicating that drug\nactivity was currently taking place or about to take place there.\n       On the strength of testimony from Officer Bodisco that Cornell “looked worried”\nand avoided making eye contact with him and his partner, the jury found the officers\nreasonably believed Cornell seemed “nervous or evasive.” But “ ‘[l]ooking at a police\nofficer and then looking away does not provide the officer with “a particularized and\nobjective basis for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity.” ’ ” (People v.\nPitts (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 881, 888.) “In general, although eye contact, or the lack\nthereof, may be considered as a factor establishing reasonable suspicion, . . . whether the\n\n\n       9\n           See, e.g., People v. Ramirez (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1552–1556.\n\n                                             14\n\fcontact is suspicious or not ‘is highly subjective and must be evaluated in light of the\ncircumstances of each case.’ [Citations.] The skepticism with which this factor is treated\nis in large part due to the fact that reliance upon ‘suspicious’ looks can so easily devolve\ninto a case of damned if you do, equally damned if you don’t. [Citations.] Accordingly,\n. . . that factor is ‘of questionable value . . . generally.’ ” (United States v. Montero-\nCamargo (9th Cir. 2000) 208 F.3d 1122, 1136.)\n       The jury’s finding that the officers’ knowledge of Hippie Hill as a hotspot for\ncrime “could lead them to suspect that Cornell may be involved in criminal activity” was\nequally true of anyone else in the vicinity. Because these two officers had insufficient\ninformation to do anything more than seek a consensual encounter with Cornell as they\nwatched him on Hippie Hill (see Casares, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 838 [“when . . . officer\ninitiated the identification procedure, . . . he had no factual basis for a reasonable\nsuspicion, as opposed to a mere hunch, that defendant was then engaged in any criminal\nactivity”]), the critical sequence of events took place when the chase began. At that\npoint, as Officers Brandt and Bodisco turned their car toward Cornell—without saying\nanything over their loudspeaker or otherwise signaling an intent to approach—Cornell\nwas already walking away, which he was entitled to do. (See People v. Souza (1994) 9\nCal.4th 224, 234 (Souza) [“a person approached by police for questioning may decline to\nanswer the questions and ‘may go on his way’ ”].) Even assuming Cornell was\ndeliberately trying to avoid Officers Brandt and Bodisco as he ran off, that did not change\nthings. Not every effort to avoid an encounter with police warrants detention. If it did,\nanyone who turns off the freeway in haste after spotting a police car in the rearview\nmirror could be stopped for trying to avoid being pulled over.\n       Pointing to the fact Cornell shed his jacket after starting to run, a move the jury\nfound gave Officers Brandt and Bodisco reasonable grounds to believe he was trying to\n“avoid detection,” appellants emphasize that evasive flight can provide reasonable\nsuspicion, especially when the experience of officers with crime in a particular area\nconnects a fleeing person to illicit activity. It is true that, in a high crime area,\n“unprovoked flight upon noticing the police” may provide reasonable suspicion in some\ncircumstances (Wardlow, supra, 528 U.S. at p. 124), and that “headlong flight wherever\n\n                                               15\n\fit occurs”—which can be considered the “consummate act of evasion”—will justify a\nstop. (Ibid.) But the High Court has declined to adopt a “ ‘bright-line rule’ authorizing\nthe temporary detention of anyone who flees at the mere sight of a police officer.” (Id. at\np. 126 (conc. & dis. opn. of Stevens, J.)), favoring instead a totality of the circumstances\napproach that requires consideration of flight along with other objective indicators\nconnecting a suspect to criminal activity. (See also Souza, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 239\n[“No single fact—for instance, flight from approaching police—can be indicative in all\ndetention cases of involvement in criminal conduct. Time, locality, lighting conditions,\nand an area’s reputation for criminal activity all give meaning to a particular act of flight,\nand may or may not suggest to a trained officer that the fleeing person is involved in\ncriminal activity. Consequently, a ‘bright-line’ rule applicable to all investigatory stops\n. . . would be improper.”].)\n       What is important here is whether the circumstances known to the officers, in\ntotality, connected Cornell to suspected criminal activity, not whether, as a standalone\nmatter, they perceived him to be fleeing from them when he began to run. The jury made\nno finding, and there was no evidence, that Cornell was carrying something Officers\nBrandt and Bodisco thought could be contraband and discarded it as he ran. Nor was\nthere any finding that Cornell was desperate, panicked or in “[h]eadlong flight”\n(Wardlow, supra, 528 U.S. at p. 124), suggesting consciousness of guilt. The special\nverdict questions bearing on how Cornell ran, to be sure, are somewhat ambiguous, but in\ninterpreting them—after considering the same evidence the jury did—the trial court’s\nultimate legal conclusion shows it read the findings as accepting Cornell’s version of\nwhat happened at the start of the chase (after a “cool down” break he resumed his run\nalong a pedestrian path, removed his jacket while running, and took enough time along\nthe path to fold it and place it on a nearby stump), rather than the officers’ version (he\nsuddenly broke into a “full blown sprint,” ran off-trail, and “dumped” his jacket while\nrunning through the bushes).10 Because the findings suggest the jury saw key details in\n\n       10\n         The trial court’s function is to draw legal conclusions from the facts found by\nspecial verdict (Code Civ. Proc., § 624), and, unless the findings are incomplete,\n\n\n                                              16\n\fthe officers’ reported perceptions of Cornell at this crucial juncture as embellishments,\nwe see no reason to disagree that the more benign view of the facts known to them is the\nbest interpretation of what the jury found.11\n       Appellants rely heavily on People v. Rodriguez, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th 1540,\nwhere a man jumped from a car and ran from an officer who was attempting to make a\nstop. Another officer who heard a radio broadcast about the fleeing suspect saw him a\nminute later, walking nearby. The second officer shined a spotlight on the suspect and\ngot out of his patrol car, at which point the suspect sprinted away, crossing traffic lanes,\nreaching into his pocket while he ran, and then throwing an item over a chain-link fence.\nUpon being chased down and detained, the suspect admitted he “knew he was running\nfrom a police officer” but ran because he had “an outstanding warrant and a digital scale\nin his pocket.” (Id. at p. 1543.) On these facts the court concluded there was more than\nenough justification to detain, closing its opinion with the remark, “This is not a case\nwhere appellant was out for an evening jog.” (Id. at p. 1544, italics added.) Here,\nnothing contradicts Cornell’s testimony that he was, in fact, out for a jog. Nor are there\nany of the particulars we see in Rodriguez, where the officers had cause to detain at the\noutset—in the traffic stop—which led the suspect to flee at a full sprint, putting himself at\nrisk in traffic while he ran.\n       Shifting their focus slightly, appellants point to Cornell’s later actions on the High\nPath, where he defied an order to stop and launched into a sprint through the woods with\n\n\ninconsistent or “hopelessly ambiguous”—which is not the case here—the court may\ninterpret the verdict in view of the pleadings, evidence and instructions. (Woodcock v.\nFontana Scaffolding & Equipment Co. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 452, 456–457 [trial judge’s\nfunction is to interpret the verdict “ ‘from its language considered in connection with the\npleadings, evidence and instructions’ ”; if trial court’s interpretation is incorrect,\nappellate court will interpret the verdict if it is possible to give a correct interpretation].)\nWe review any such interpretation de novo. (Ibid.)\n       11\n          The jury answered “No” to Question No. 10, which indicates it did not find\ncredible the testimony from Officer Bodisco that Cornell ran off-trail through the bushes,\nconsistent with its earlier “No” response to Question No. 4, indicating it had also rejected\nthe officers’ testimony that they believed Cornell emerged from the bushes at the top of\nHippie Hill when they first saw him.\n\n                                                17\n\fdesperate abandon, scrambling down the side of a hill into the AIDS Memorial Grove.\nThis sequence of events on the High Path, they say, was part of a fluid series of events\nleading up to the moment of arrest. By then, appellants contend, the jury’s findings\nestablish without doubt that Cornell was in full flight, clearly indicating consciousness of\nguilt. They argue that, given the evolving nature of the situation, we must not limit the\nquestion to what Officers Brandt and Bodisco knew at the outset of the chase, but must\nconsider all the circumstances known to them prior to Cornell’s surrender. We agree, but\nthe problem for appellants is that what happened on the High Path was provoked. The\njury’s finding that Officers Brandt and Farrell reasonably perceived Cornell to be running\naway from them at that point does not negate the obvious: Foolishly or not, Cornell ran\naway at the point of a gun and a threat of “I will shoot you.” Other than this panicked\nreaction—which Officer Brandt brought about—there was no greater cause to detain\nCornell on the High Path than there was on Hippie Hill.12\n       Granted, the better and certainly the safer course for Cornell was to surrender on\nthe High Path, but in order for his defiance to constitute a violation of Penal Code section\n148, Officers Brandt and Farrell still had to be acting in the lawful performance of their\nduties, which places the focus back on what happened at the beginning of the chase.\nBecause Officers Brandt and Bodisco did not have reasonable suspicion to detain in the\nfirst place, the trial court properly concluded that none of the appellant officers acted in\nthe lawful course of his duties at later points in time. Thus, when Cornell darted away on\nthe High Path, it made no difference whether he took off out of fright, still unaware he\nwas being chased by police officers (as he claims), or out of a desire not to be caught,\ndespite having looked straight at two uniformed officers, in defiance of their command to\n\n       12\n           We might have been inclined to conclude otherwise if the jury had found that\nCornell, in reaction to a command from Officer Brandt to stop, had committed some\ncrime posing a threat to any of the appellant officers or to the public. Under Brown v.\nIllinois (1975) 422 U.S. 590, that would have attenuated the taint of the unjustified\nattempt to detain him. But merely fleeing on foot from a show of force does not bring\nBrown doctrine into play. (United States v. Brodie (D.C. Cir. 2014) 742 F.3d 1058, 1063\n[Brown attenuation doctrine not applicable where detainee, in response to officers’ orders\nto put his hands on car hood preparatory to a search of his person, “fled on foot, and the\nmanner of his flight in itself posed no incremental threat to anyone”].)\n\n                                              18\n\fstop (as the officers claim). Officer Brandt chased down and trained a weapon on a\nrunning man about whom he knew virtually nothing, except that this was someone who\nhad the temerity to try to elude capture. Without something objectively tying him to\ncriminal activity, we conclude that none of the appellant officers had a legal basis to\ndetain—much less probable cause to arrest—on Hippie Hill, on the High Path, or in\nAIDS Memorial Grove.\n         B.    Incomplete Phase I Special Verdict\n         In addition to claiming there was reasonable suspicion to detain and thus probable\ncause to arrest, appellants challenge the Phase I verdict on procedural grounds. After\nmany days of deliberation in Phase I, and after the jury had sent multiple messages to the\ncourt asking about specific questions posed on the Phase I Verdict Form, and after\nrepeatedly reporting an inability to reach a verdict on a number of those questions, the\njury finally managed to reach a verdict on all but one question, Question No. 8.\nAppellants argue that this question—which asked the jury to find whether Officers\nBrandt and Bodisco reasonably believed Cornell was fleeing from them when he began\nrunning on Hippie Hill—was so material to the issue of reasonable suspicion that it was\nreversible error to accept the Phase I verdict without an answer to it. On that basis, they\ncontend it was an abuse of discretion to deny their motion for a mistrial. We cannot\nagree.\n         Even assuming the acceptance of an incomplete Phase I Verdict Form was error,\nwe do not see the factual issue presented by Question No. 8 as so material to the total mix\nof facts that it would have changed the outcome on the issue of reasonable suspicion had\nit been decided in favor of appellants. Cornell would have been entitled to walk away\nhad the officers approached him on Hippie Hill, as we note above. Our analysis of the\ncircumstances when he left Hippie Hill assumes Officers Brandt and Bodisco did\nperceive he ran from them, as they testified, and as Question No. 8 asked the jury to find,\nbut even granting that assumption we do not think the totality of what they knew at that\nstage points to anything more than a hunch that he could have had some connection to\ncriminal activity on Hippie Hill. We thus conclude the court did not abuse its discretion\nby denying appellants’ motion for a mistrial. (See Blumenthal v. Superior Court (2006)\n\n                                             19\n\f137 Cal.App.4th 672, 679 [“ ‘A trial court should grant a mistrial only when a party’s\nchances of receiving a fair trial have been irreparably damaged, and we use the\ndeferential abuse of discretion standard to review a trial court ruling denying a\nmistrial.’ ”)\n       C.       Statutory Immunity Under Penal Code Section 847, Subdivision (b)\n       Next, appellants argue we should reverse because the trial court never\n“specifically addressed” whether the appellant officers are statutorily immune for the\nfalse arrest of Cornell. Penal Code section 847, subdivision (b) provides that “[t]here\nshall be no civil liability on the part of, and no cause of action shall arise against, any\npeace officer . . . , acting within the scope of his or her authority, for false arrest or false\nimprisonment arising out of any arrest” under specified circumstances, and one of those\ncircumstances, set forth in subdivision (b)(1), is that “[t]he arrest was lawful, or the peace\nofficer, at the time of the arrest, had reasonable cause to believe the arrest was lawful.”\n       We see no error here either. California courts speak of “reasonable cause” and\n“probable cause” interchangeably (Pool v. City of Oakland (1986) 42 Cal.3d 1051, 1069;\nO’Toole v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 488, 510), and appellants cite no case\nrecognizing any meaningful distinction in the two phrases. The statutory scheme of\nwhich Penal Code section 847 is part,13 much of which was enacted in 1872 as part of the\nField Code, uses both terms without differentiation, and the few cases that apply\nsubdivision (b)(1)—which first appeared in language added by amendment in 195714—\ngive no separate consideration to its reach after completing their analyses of probable\ncause. (See O’Toole, at pp. 511–513; Hamilton v. City of San Diego (1990) 217\nCal.App.3d 838, 844 (Hamilton).) Thus, the trial judge here was not alone in perceiving\nno need to undertake an analysis of appellants’ statutory immunity argument, separate\nfrom her probable cause analysis.\n\n\n\n       13\n            Penal Code Part 2, Title 3, Chapter 5, section 833 et seq.\n       14\n        Statute 1957, chapter 2147, section 5, page 3806; Assembly Bill No. 1857,\napproved by Governor July 8, 1957 (1957 Reg. Sess.).\n\n                                               20\n\f       While novel, appellants’ argument has worthy bona fides. It is based on a reading\nof the language of Penal Code 847, subdivision (b), that was first advocated in 1963 by\nthe eminent scholar of governmental immunity in California, Professor Arvo Van\nAlstyne. Focusing his attention on the fact that the statute, by its literal terms, affords\nimmunity for false arrest if “the arrest was lawful, or the peace officer, at the time of the\narrest, had reasonable cause to believe the arrest was lawful” (italics added), Professor\nVan Alstyne argued that the disjunctive phrase “reasonable cause to believe” would be\nsurplusage if it did not defeat liability for unlawful arrests as well as lawful ones.

To trigger the protection of the\nstatute, he argued, an officer should only be required to show he in fact believed the\narrest was justified. (Id. at p. 408.)15\n       Giving a modern twist to what was, in effect, a call for immunity by Professor Van\nAlstyne based on a standard of subjective good faith, appellants suggest we read into\nPenal Code section 847, subdivision (b), the federal standard for qualified immunity that\nhas evolved in the last three decades, which is based on an objective appraisal of whether\nan officer facing civil suit violated “clearly established” law, and is not simply a test of\nsubjective good faith. (See Estate of Lopez v. Gelhaus (9th Cir. 2017) 871 F.3d 998,\n1005, 1017–1018.) This immunity doctrine, developed by the federal courts in the\ncontext of Fourth Amendment claims under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 (Section 1983),\nderiving it from the common law with no statutory foundation, is purely judge-made.\n(Anderson v. Creighton (1987) 483 U.S. 635, 645 (Anderson); see Harlow v. Fitzgerald\n\n       15\n          “At the Legislature’s request, the California Law Revision Commission\nsubmitted a comprehensive report in 1963, which gave rise to the statutory system that\nnow governs the field of public entity tort liability. . . .[¶] Professor . . . Van Alstyne was\nthe California Law Revision Commission’s chief consultant and much of his work gave\nrise to the present statutory system.” (Mary M. v.

Rep. at p. 5,\nfn.*.)” (Property Reserve, Inc. v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 151, 182, fn. 10.)\n\n\n                                              21\n\f(1982) 457 U.S. 800, 813-819; Pierson v. Ray (1967) 386 U.S. 547, 557.) Citing\nVenegas v. County of Los Angeles (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1230 (Venegas II),16 Cornell\ncontends the federal common law doctrine of qualified immunity “does not apply at all to\nstate law claims, specifically false arrest claims,” but he never specifically engages with\nappellants’ reading of the text of section 847, subdivision (b).\n       Cornell is correct that Venegas II held that the federal qualified immunity “does\nnot apply to actions brought under . . . [S]ection 52.1” (153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1246), but\nthe appellate panel in that case took care to mention it was not addressing “whether a\nstatutory immunity might apply.” (Ibid.) We understand appellants to be taking up the\nissue left open there, using Penal Code section 847 as the statutory basis for their\nargument, while, in effect, bringing in federal qualified immunity, so to speak, “through\nthe back door.” Even if we were receptive to the idea of introducing federal qualified\nimmunity into California law in this fashion despite the holding in Venegas II—we are\nnot, since we view that opinion as soundly reasoned—we reject the premise that Penal\nCode section 847, subdivision (b)(1) adds an extra layer of protection beyond what is\nalready afforded by the doctrine of probable cause. Because nothing in the statutory\nscheme for official immunity in California alters the rule that “[u]nder California law, a\npolice officer is not granted governmental immunity for false arrest and imprisonment”\n(O’Toole, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 510), we see no basis to borrow the federal rule of\nqualified immunity absent specific legislative authorization.\n       We do not agree that Penal Code section 847 provides that authorization.\nSubdivision (b)(1) of Penal Code section 847 is coextensive with the doctrine of probable\ncause (Hamilton, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 846), but goes no further. Since at least the\n\n\n       16\n          Venegas II is one of a series of appellate opinions arising out of a suit brought\nby plaintiff David Venegas against the County of Los Angeles and various deputies of the\nLos Angeles Sheriff’s Department seeking damages in connection with his alleged\nwrongful detention and arrest. It was decided on remand following the California\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Venegas v. County of Los Angeles (2004) 32 Cal.4th\n820, 843 (Venegas), which, as we discuss below, is central to our analysis of the\nappellant’s claim of error in connection with the Section 52.1 verdict here.\n\n\n                                             22\n\fearly 1950s, it has been settled that a “police officer who makes an arrest without a\nwarrant and without justification may be held civilly liable for false arrest and\nimprisonment.” (Dragna v. White (1955) 45 Cal.2d 469, 471 (Dragna).)17 When the\nlanguage of Penal Code section 847, subdivision (b) was added to the Penal Code by\namendment in 1957, nothing in the legislative history suggests it was intended to reverse\nor supersede Dragna. Quite to the contrary, what little discussion there was of this\nspecific amendment as Assembly Bill No. 1857 moved through the Legislature indicates\nit was understood as a codification of then-existing law. (See Sen. Interim Judiciary\nCom. (1955–1957), Fourth Progress Report to the Legislature, Rep. on Assem. Bill No.\n1857, at p. 427 [Senate Interim Judiciary Committee Report], quoting statement of the\nDistrict Attorneys Association concerning Assembly Bill No. 1857 [“[t]his bill seeks to\namend the Penal Code sections on arrest—to make them reflect the law of arrest as\ndeclared and interpreted by the appellate courts of California—and to incorporate parts of\nthe Uniform Arrest Act, with the intention that the statutory law of California shall be a\n\n\n\n\n       17\n           (See also Miller v. Glass (1955) 44 Cal.2d 359, 363; Hughes v. Oreb (1951) 36\nCal.2d 854.) Even in their era, the Dragna line of cases did not break new ground. They\nsimply applied in the setting of unlawful arrest and false imprisonment the firmly rooted\ncommon law principle that where a law enforcement officer engages in tortious acts\nwithin the scope of his office, he is acting under color of law—meaning under pretense of\nlegal authority, even though his acts are illegal—and thus he may be held liable in tort.\n(Abbott v. Cooper (1933) 218 Cal. 425, 432 [“[W]here a person holding the office of\nsheriff or constable does acts colore officii, though he had no sufficient warrant to do the\nact, he is responsible to third persons in an action for a breach of official duty. Such a\nrule is declared to be supported by the weight of authority.”]; see Steven L. Winter, The\nMeaning of “Under Color of” Law (1992) 91 Mich. L.Rev. 323, at pp. 342–346\n[common law origins of the concept of extra-legal official conduct undertaken “under\ncolor of law”].) The same concept has long been accepted in law enforcement\nmisconduct cases under federal civil rights law. (Monroe v. Pape (1961) 365 U.S. 167,\n181–187, overruled on other grounds in Monell v. Department of Social Services of City\nof New York (1978) 436 U.S. 658.)\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\ftrue, accurate and concise guide to the substantive rights and duties of peace officers and\ncitizens alike”]; id. at p. 430 [citing Dragna as established law]).18\n       The surplusage argument on which appellants’ proffered interpretation of Penal\nCode section 847 hinges, echoing Professor Van Alstyne, is not persuasive. The\nlegislative history makes clear why section 847, subdivision (b) uses the disjunctive in\nreferring to a “lawful” arrest “or” an arrest made on “reasonable cause to believe the\narrest was lawful.” The alternative “reasonable cause” scenario tracks a secondary\nholding of the Dragna case, which addresses liability for unreasonably prolonged jail\ndetention prior to arraignment. (See Dragna, supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 473 [“where the\narrest is lawful, subsequent unreasonable delay in taking the person before a magistrate\nwill not affect the legality of the arrest, although it will subject the offending person to\nliability for so much of the imprisonment as occurs after the period of necessary or\nreasonable delay.”].) Thus, the Senate Interim Judiciary Committee Report, citing\nDragna, explains that, “present legal thinking [citation] indicates that while an arrest,\nbased upon reasonable cause, is lawful, . . . a subsequent detention could be unlawful.\nSuch would be the case if after arrest, but before the arraignment, the arresting officer\n\n\n       18\n          In response to the California Supreme Court’s landmark decision recognizing\nthe exclusionary rule in People v. Cahan (1955) 44 Cal.2d 434, Assembly Bill 1857 was\nan effort to update and clarify the statutory rules governing arrest in California. (Senate\nInterim Judiciary Committee Report at pp. 437, 439; see House Resolution No. 184 (May\n19, 1955) [discussing Cahan as the impetus for the bill].) Objections to Assembly Bill\nNo. 1857 focused primarily on the fact that, for the first time, broad legislative\nrecognition was being given to the power of warrantless detention in circumstances short\nof arrest. (See Senate Interim Judiciary Committee Report at pp. 445–447 [quoting\ncomments of the State Bar of California conveyed by letter dated June 4, 1957 from\nJoseph A. Ball, State Bar President, to Hon. Patrick D. McGee, Chairman of the\nAssembly Judiciary Committee and sponsor of Assem. Bill No. 1857].) On our own\nmotion, under Evidence Code sections 452, subdivision (c) and 459, we take judicial\nnotice of the above-cited legislative history materials, since committee reports and\nlegislative resolutions are “indicative of the intent of the Legislature as a whole.”\n(Metropolitan Water Dist. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1425,\nitalics omitted (Metropolitan Water).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\flearn[s] of facts which destroy[] the belief upon which his reasonable cause was based.”\n(Senate Interim Judiciary Committee Report, supra, at p. 430.)\n       Understood within the context provided by the legislative history, therefore, the\nreference to both “lawful arrest” and arrest on “reasonable cause” in section 847,\nsubdivision (b)(1), is not surplusage. It is simply descriptive of the two-part holding in\nDragna that the Legislature recognized as foundational. Shorn of its textual premise, the\npolicy rationale for Professor Van Alstyne’s reading of the statutory language—that\npeace officers should have protection from civil liability for arrests made upon reasonable\nmistake—is already fundamental to the modern concept of probable cause and its close\ncousin reasonable suspicion. Without clear and definite legislative authorization, we are\nnot inclined to announce that, after all these years, we have discovered in section 847,\nsubdivision (b) an additional layer of protection from civil liability beyond what already\nexists through the doctrine of probable cause, or to use section 847 as the statutory basis\nfor importing federal qualified immunity into California law.19\n       D.     Section 52.1 Claim\n              1.     The Bane Act\n       On the recommendation of a commission appointed by then Attorney General\nJohn Van de Kamp, the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Stats.1987, ch. 1277, §§ 3–4,\n\n       19\n          It is worth noting that the High Court’s decision to create for law enforcement\nofficers the added level of protection against Section 1983 liability provided by the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity was announced by a closely divided 5-4 vote, over a\nvigorous dissent from Justice Stevens, who pointed out that such an immunity is\nunnecessary because “the probable-cause standard itself recognizes the fair leeway that\nlaw enforcement officers must have in carrying out their dangerous work. The concept of\nprobable cause leaves room for mistakes, provided always that they are mistakes that\ncould have been made by a reasonable officer.” (Anderson, supra, 483 U.S. 635, 661\n(dis. opn. of Stevens, J.); id. at p. 659 [referring to the new rule as a “double standard of\nreasonableness”].) And as recently as this past High Court term, sharp criticism of the\nqualified immunity doctrine from at least one current member of the Court has been\nexpressed. (See Ziglar v. Abbasi (2017) 582 U.S. __, 137 S.Ct. 1843, 1871 (conc. opn. of\nThomas, J.) [“Our qualified immunity precedents . . . represent precisely the sort of\n‘freewheeling policy choice[s]’ that we have previously disclaimed the power to\nmake.”].)\n\n\n                                             25\n\fpp. 4544–4548) (the Bane Act) was enacted in 1987 “as part of a comprehensive package\nof legislation to combat hate crimes.” (Venegas II, supra, 153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1242.)20\nThe Bane Act is enforceable criminally, under Penal Code section 422.6 (In re M.S.\n(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 713, 715), and civilly, under Section 52.1 (Jones v. Kmart Corp.\n(1998) 17 Cal.4th 329 (Jones).) While Penal Code section 422.6 is focused specifically\non hate crimes as conventionally understood (i.e. acts of violence or intimidation aimed\nat members of statutorily protected groups), Section 52.1 sweeps much more broadly,\nprotecting against all conduct aimed at “ ‘interfer[ing]’ ” with rights “ ‘secured by’ ” the\nconstitutional or statutory law of the United States, or of California, where the\ninterference is carried out “by threats, intimidation or coercion,” whether or not the\noffending conduct is motivated by discriminatory animus. (Venegas, supra, 32 Cal.4th at\np. 843.)21\n       The centerpiece of civil enforcement under the Bane Act is subdivision (a) of\nSection 52.1, which provides, “If a person or persons, whether or not acting under color\n\n\n       20\n         (See Attorney General’s Com. on Racial, Ethnic, Religious and Minority\nViolence, Final Report (April 1986) (Final Report of the Van de Kamp Commission);\nAssem.

(See 18 U.S.C. § 241 [Section\n241] and 18 U.S.C.§ 242 [Section 242], two criminal statutes which were enacted as\nsections 6 and 17 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, and their civil counterpart statutes,\nrespectively, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) (Section 1985(3)) and Section 1983, which were\n\n\n                                             26\n\fof law, interferes by threat, intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threat,\nintimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or individuals\nof rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured\nby the Constitution or laws of this state, the Attorney General, or any district attorney or\ncity attorney may bring a civil action for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief\nin the name of the people of the State of California, in order to protect the peaceable\nexercise or enjoyment of the right or rights secured. . . .” Private actions by aggrieved\nindividuals are authorized under Section 52.1, subdivision (b), which provides for\nrecovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, and\nattorney’s fees. “The creation of civil causes of action by victims of . . . conduct” in\nviolation of Section 52.1 is central to the Bane Act’s enforcement scheme. (Stamps v.\nSuperior Court (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1448 [legislative history shows private\nactions intended to be “at the heart of the legislation”].)\n       Claims may be brought under Section 52.1, subdivision (a), against rights-\ninterfering conduct by private actors as well as by public officials (Jones, supra, 17\nCal.4th at p. 338), including police officers (Simmons v. Superior Court (2016) 7\nCal.App.5th 1113 (Simmons)). The word “interferes” as used in Section 52.1 has been\nconstrued as “violates.” (See Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 338 [California Supreme\nCourt equates “interfere” with “violate”].) “ ‘The essence of a Bane Act claim is that the\ndefendant, by the specified improper means (i.e., “threats, intimidation or coercion”),\ntried to or did prevent the plaintiff from doing something he or she had the right to do\nunder the law or to force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not required to\ndo under the law.’ ” (Simmons, at p. 1125; accord, Austin B. v.

L.Rev.\n2113, 2135–2145 & Appendices [tracing the Post-Civil War civil rights statutes as\noriginally enacted through various recodifications in the United States Code].)\n\n                                              27\n\f       The model for Section 52.1 is a similarly worded Massachusetts statute,\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act of 1979 (Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 12, §§ 11H, 11I)\n(MCRA). (Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 335.) Some courts interpreting and applying\nthe MCRA and Section 52.1 have concluded, without close examination, that these\nrespective statutes are state law analogues to Section 1983. (See Cameron v. Craig (9th\nCir. 2013) 713 F.3d 1012, 1022 [“[T]he elements of the excessive force claim under\n§ 52.1 are the same as under § 1983.”]; Batchelder v. Allied Stores Corp. (1985) 393\nMass. 819, 822–823 [473 N.E.2d 1128, 1131] [“the Legislature intended to provide a\nremedy under [MCRA], coextensive with 42 U.S.C. § 1983 . . . , except that the Federal\nstatute requires State action whereas its State counterpart does not”].) In a broad\nconceptual sense, that is true, since both Section 52.1 and the MCRA are supplements to\nSection 1983, providing state law civil remedies for violation of constitutional and\nstatutory rights protected by federal as well as state law. But the most similar federal\ncivil rights statute to Section 52.1, textually and structurally—similar enough to suggest\nthat it, not Section 1983, was the original template our Legislature drew from—is Section\n241. (See Final Report of the Van de Kamp Commission, Chptr. 3, “Proposed California\nCivil Rights Act,” at p. 23 & p. 24, fn. 4 [“The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act is\npatterned after federal civil rights statutes that protect rights guaranteed by federal laws\nand the Constitution,” citing to Section 241, with no mention of Section 1983].)22\n\n\n       22\n          While the citation to Section 241 in the Final Report of the Van de Kamp\nCommission provides fairly clear evidence of the genesis of Section 52.1, the language of\nSection 52.1 is also traceable to Section 241 by direct comparison. Section 52.1 adopts\nthe signature structure of Section 241, which prohibits interference with the “free\nexercise” or “enjoyment” of a broadly-defined class of “secured” civil rights. And\nSection 52.1, like Section 241, targets the use of fear-inducing conduct to carry out the\ninterference. Where Section 52.1 prohibits “interfere[nce]” by “threats, intimidation or\ncoercion,” Section 241 prohibits attempts to “injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate”\nsomeone in the exercise of protected rights. In addition, the modern adaptation of\nSection 241’s rights-interference structure in other federal legislation can be seen in the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965, which uses language nearly identical to that of Section 52.1.\n(See 52 U.S.C. § 10101(b) [“No person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise,\nshall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other\n\n\n                                              28\n\f              2.     Appellants’ Contentions\n       Appellants argue we should reverse the finding for Cornell on his Section 52.1\nclaim along with the accompanying award of statutory attorney’s fees because there was\ninsufficient evidence to submit that claim to the jury. This attack on the Section 52.1\nverdict here is three-pronged. First, appellants point out that since the jury rejected\nCornell’s assault claim, it necessarily rejected his claim of excessive force. Relying on\nthe requirement that a Section 52.1 claim must rest on evidence of “threat[], intimidation\nor coercion,” they contend it was error for the trial court to submit this statutory claim to\nthe jury. We reject the premise of this argument. Nothing in the Phase I Special Verdict\nForm required the jury to make any express finding on the issue of unreasonable force.\nThe Phase I jury instruction on assault defined unreasonable force using the Fourth\nAmendment multifactor articulation of excessive force in Graham v. Connor (1989) 490\nU.S. 386 (Graham), and listed the use of unreasonable force, so defined, as one of six\nelements of assault.23 Because the use of unreasonable force was only one element of the\n\n\nperson for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote\nas he may choose . . .”].)\n\n        By contrast, the text of Section 1983 and its criminal counterpart Section 242—\nstatutes which are limited to state action, and focus on “depriv[ation]’” of rights instead\nof interference with rights—bears almost no similarity to Section 52.1, other than\ncommon use of the phrase “under color of law.” Section 1985(3), the civil counterpart to\nSection 241, also differs significantly from Section 241. Section 1985(3) is limited to\nprivate acts of “conspir[ing] or go[ing] in disguise on the highway or on the premises of\nanother, for the purpose of depriving . . . any person or class of persons of the equal\nprotection of the laws . . . .” Based on its limiting language, a requisite element of any\nSection 1985(3) claim is that it must be based on “some racial [or] . . . otherwise class-\nbased, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators’ action” (Griffin v.\nBreckenridge (1971) 403 U.S. 88, 102), which is the very limitation our Supreme Court\nheld in Venegas does not apply to Section 52.1. (Venegas, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 843.)\nThis compare-and-contrast exercise thus leaves Section 241 as the most closely\ncomparable statute to Section 52.1 among its historical antecedents in federal civil rights\nlaw.\n       23\n         The court’s assault instruction, adapted from Judicial Council Of California\nCivil Jury Instructions (CACI) Nos. 1301 (Assault—Essential Elements) and 1305\n\n\n                                             29\n\fassault instruction, the jury may have rejected the assault claim while still believing there\nwas unreasonable force here.\n       Cornell’s theory was that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin committed an assault\nby pointing a gun at him, putting him in fear of being shot. In support of this theory, he\npresented evidence that the gun-pointing by both officers in a low-threat level situation\nviolated the San Francisco Police Department’s policy on the use of deadly force and\nofficer training standards for handling weapons. Indulging all inferences in favor of\nreconciling the Phase I and Phase II verdicts, as we must, a rational jury in Phase II could\nhave concluded that, under the circumstances, the threatened use of deadly force was\nunreasonable (see Robinson v. Solano County (9th Cir. 2002) 278 F.3d 1007, 1013\n[officers’ conduct in pointing gun at detainee at close range presents triable issue of fact\non excessive force claim]), while at the same time concluding in Phase I that the gun-\npointing—standing alone—was not a substantial factor in the “harm” caused to Cornell.\nOn this reading of the jury’s verdicts, what accounts for the Phase II findings against\nOfficer Brandt and Sergeant Gin on the Section 52.1 claim is that the gun-pointing\ncombined with the unlawful arrest, the baseless Penal Code section 148 citation, and all\nof the other mistreatment of Cornell following the arrest, caused the harm.\n       The explanation for the finding against Cornell on the assault claim, but in his\nfavor on the Section 52.1 claim, may also be one of timing. In resolving the assault\nclaim, the jury may have decided in Phase I that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin were\nprivileged to use force under Penal Code section 835a [“[a]ny peace officer who has\nreasonable cause to believe . . . [an arrestee] has committed a public offense may use\nreasonable force to effect the arrest]”, but then, following the court’s determination of no\n\n\n\n\n(Battery by Police Officer), advised the jury that, to prove assault, Cornell must establish\nthat (1) a defendant threatened to touch him in a harmful or offensive manner, (2) it\nreasonably appeared to him the threat was about to be carried out, (3) the threat\nconstituted unreasonable force, (4) he did not consent to the touching, (5) he was harmed,\nand (6) the threatening conduct was a substantial factor in causing his harm.\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\fprobable cause, concluded in Phase II that there was no such privilege.24 For both of\nthese reasons, we do not accept the premise that the jury’s adverse assault verdict in\nPhase I destroyed the basis for Section 52.1 liability in Phase II. (See Bender v. County\nof Los Angeles (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 968, 978 (Bender) [where an arrest is unlawful\nand excessive force is used in effectuating it, there is coercion within the meaning of\nSection 52.1].)\n       Second, appellants argue that Cornell proved a false arrest, at most, and that\nliability under Section 52.1 cannot be based on false arrest alone. (See Allen v. City of\nSacramento (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 41, 67, 69 (Allen) [rejecting claim that an arrest\nwithout probable cause constitutes “coercion” within the meaning of Section 52.1].) We\nhave more here than a simple false arrest. Cornell’s arrest was carried out with threats of\nviolence and was just the start of a series of events suggesting an intent to demean him\nand set him up for termination, without regard to whether the suspicions that led to the\narrest were well-founded. After an interrogation by Officer Brandt at Park Station during\nwhich Brandt accused Cornell of lying, over his protestations he had done nothing wrong,\nCornell was finally released, nearly six hours following his arrest. By that time, a team\nof officers had undertaken a fruitless hunt for incriminating evidence in Golden Gate\nPark; a secret recording device was placed next to Cornell in an ambulance “because [he]\nmight say something stupid,” which yielded nothing; and a hospital drug test turned up\nnegative.\n       Then, upon Cornell’s release, he was cited for the misdemeanor offense of\nviolating Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a). That citation was referred to the\n\n\n       24\n          The trial court gave a Phase I instruction under Penal Code section 835a in\nconnection with the assault claim, but did not re-instruct on Penal Code section 835a in\nPhase II. Appellants contend the omission of a Penal Code section 835a instruction in\nPhase II was error, but they made no specific request for such an instruction in Phase II,\nand as a result, they have waived the issue. Even had they made one, however, they\nwould not have been entitled to another Penal Code section 835a instruction, since, as\nnoted, by that point—given the trial court’s no probable cause determination at the\nconclusion of Phase I—the requirement in Penal Code section 835a that Officer Brandt\nand Sergeant Gin acted with “reasonable cause to believe the person to be arrested has\ncommitted a public offense” was lacking.\n\n                                             31\n\finternal affairs unit of the San Francisco Police Department, and without further\ninvestigation by internal affairs, the citation became the basis of a misconduct charge,\nresulting in Cornell’s firing. Officer Brandt, who gave Cornell the citation, admitted not\nknowing the factual basis for the Penal Code section 148 charge, and Sergeant Gin, who\napproved the citation, admitted he had no independent knowledge about why it was\nissued. According to Alice Villagomez, the head of Human Resources in the San\nFrancisco Police Department, any experienced officer would have understood the citation\nwould likely result in Cornell’s termination. All of this evidence supports an inference\nnot only that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin arrested Cornell unlawfully, but that they\nacted spitefully toward him as well since they knew or should have known the career-\nending Penal Code section 148 citation they gave him upon his release was baseless.25\n       Third, appellants invoke Shoyoye v. County of Los Angeles (2012) 203\nCal.App.4th 947 (Shoyoye), on which Bender and Allen both rely. We are told that\nShoyoye “requires a showing of coercion independent from the coercion inherent in the\nwrongful detention itself” (Shoyoye, at p. 959), and that, because none of the\nmistreatment of Cornell is meaningfully segregable or discrete from his arrest, appellants\nstill must prevail as a matter of law on the Section 52.1 claim. We think appellants read\ntoo much into Shoyoye. There, the plaintiff was arrested on outstanding bench warrants\nfor two minor offenses, one based on a theft by someone posing as him, and upon a\nsubsequent court appearance he was ordered released. (Id. at pp. 950–951.) Due to a\ncomputer error, however, he remained in Los Angeles County jail on a parole violation\nhold order meant for someone else. (Id. at pp. 951–953.) Kafkaesque is an overused\n\n\n\n       25\n           Cf. Gillan, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at pages 1047, 1052–1053 (affirming jury\nfinding of liability against police defendants on Section 52.1 claim by high school girls’\nbasketball coach who was arrested without cause on an unfounded molestation charge\nthat district attorney declined to prosecute for lack of evidence, while reversing damages\naward because the trial court erroneously submitted to the jury defamation and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress claims for which defendants had official immunity,\nallowing the jury to award nearly $4.5 million in damages in lump sum on all claims).\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fterm, but it fairly describes plaintiff Shoyoye’s 16-day incarceration.26 After the mistake\nwas finally discovered and he was released, plaintiff Shoyoye sued the county for\nkeeping him in custody despite the release order, alleging a false imprisonment claim for\nhis wrongful incarceration as well as a Section 52.1 claim on the theory that the county’s\nfailure to discover the mistaken hold order violated his right under the Fourth\nAmendment and under article 1, section 13 of the California Constitution “to be free from\n. . . unreasonable seizure by actual or implied use of threats, intimidation or coercion.”\n(Id. at p. 953.)27\n\n\n       26\n          Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at pages 951–952 (“Shoyoye asked a total of\nsix to eight people for assistance during his incarceration. . . . [I]nmates were periodically\npermitted to submit one written question on a ‘yellow sheet’ form. Shoyoye submitted\nsuch a form asking, ‘Why am I here?’ He received the response that he was subject to a\n‘DCL hold.’ He submitted another form inquiring what a ‘DCL hold’ was, along with\none other question, and received the response that he was only entitled to ask one\nquestion and he had asked two. He submitted other yellow sheets indicating he believed\nhe should not be there, but he received no helpful responses. [¶] Shoyoye told custody\nassistant Lawrence Wong that he thought he should be released. Wong acknowledged\nthat if what he said was true, then there was a problem. Wong told him to talk to Deputy\nNiels Gittisarn. Shoyoye asked him for assistance, and Gittisarn told him, ‘Get back to\nme.’ However, when Shoyoye attempted to speak to him the next day, Gittisarn rebuffed\nhim, yelling that he was busy.”).\n       27\n          No doubt because the issue was never raised, Shoyoye is silent on a key\nthreshold question: Did plaintiff Shoyoye assert a legally viable right “secured by the\nConstitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured by the Constitution or\nlaws of this state”? It is not evident to us that he did. Because the reasonableness of a\nseizure for Fourth Amendment purposes is judged at the time of an arrest or detention,\nonce Shoyoye conceded there was probable cause for his arrest he appears to have\nconceded away at the same time any legal basis for a claim of unreasonable seizure\nbeyond that point. (See Rivera v. County of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2014) 745 F.3d 384,\n389–390 [“post-arrest incarceration is analyzed under the Fourteenth Amendment”]; Lee\nv. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2001) 250 F.3d 668, 683–685 [separately analyzing arrest\nunder Fourth Amendment and post-arrest incarceration under Fourteenth Amendment].)\nWhile a post-arrest claim of Fourth Amendment violation may be available where the\nplaintiff seeks to challenge a subsequent pretrial detention by attacking the existence of\nprobable cause ab initio (see Manuel v. Joliet (2017) 580 U.S.__ [137 S.Ct. 911, 915,\n919] [Section 1983 claim asserted by prisoner held for 48 days in pretrial detention\npursuant to judicial determination of probable cause based on a false statements from the\n\n\n                                             33\n\f       Reversing a plaintiff’s jury verdict for Shoyoye on the Bane Act claim while\naffirming on the false imprisonment claim, the appellate panel in Shoyoye set forth its\nanalysis of Section 52.1 liability in two steps, first concluding that, “[t]he statutory\nframework of section 52.1 indicates that the Legislature meant the statute to address\ninterference with constitutional rights involving more egregious conduct than mere\nnegligence.” (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 958; see id. at p. 959 [“The apparent\npurpose of the statute is not to provide relief for an overdetention brought about by\nhuman error rather than intentional conduct”].) Although that would have been enough\nto resolve the Section 52.1 claim had it been asserted on a standalone basis without an\naccompanying tort claim, the court went on in a separate section to explain that violation\nof Section 52.1 requires a showing of coercion “independent from the coercion inherent\nin the wrongful detention itself.” (Shoyoye, at pp. 959, 960–961.) While acknowledging\nthat plaintiff Shoyoye’s imprisonment may have been “traumatic” and “frightening,” and\nthat “County employees certainly were rude to him at times,” the court concluded that\n“they did not threaten or intimidate [him] for voicing his opinion that he should be\nreleased. They coerced him to remain incarcerated, but they did not for example coerce\nhim to stop inquiring about his release, threaten him for doing so, or punish him in any\nway. No one ignored plaintiff deliberately, knowing that he should in fact be released, let\nalone purposefully threaten or intimidate him. At worst they were rude and indifferent to\nhis inquiries. But jail officials do not have a duty to be polite.” (Id. at p. 961.) We see\nthe case before us differently, for reasons we explain below.\n              3.      Shoyoye is a Jail Overdetention Case that Began with A Lawful\n                      Arrest\n\n       To begin with, the record here supports a finding of more than negligence or lack\nof courtesy. More importantly, we view the second step of the court’s Section 52.1\nanalysis in Shoyoye—its independent from inherent coercion test—as inapplicable where,\nas here, a Bane Act plaintiff pleads and proves a constitutionally unlawful arrest. We\n\n\narresting officer is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment]), Shoyoye made no\nsuch claim.\n\n\n                                              34\n\freach this conclusion upon a close reading of Shoyoye, paying careful attention to its facts\nand to the claims at issue there. The situation leading to plaintiff Shoyoye’s mistaken\nincarceration started with his arrest, and originally he alleged a constitutionally\nunreasonable seizure, but as the case proceeded there was never any dispute that the\narrest was lawful. In fact, he conceded there was probable cause to arrest him. (Shoyoye,\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 951, fn. 2.) Thus, the nub of his Section 52.1 theory was not\nunlawful arrest, but rather his continued incarceration despite a judicial release order—in\nshort, jail overdetention.\n       At trial, Shoyoye presented evidence that, while in jail, he inquired repeatedly\nabout why he had not been released, but was ignored by his jailers until, through a friend,\nhe managed to have a member of the Legislature look into his circumstances, which\nultimately triggered his release. (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 951–953.) On\nthat record, the appellate court affirmed the false imprisonment verdict (id. at p. 963),\nconsistent with well-established California law that a jailer who “knew or should have\nknown of the illegality of the imprisonment” will be liable in tort for false imprisonment.\n(Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 12 Cal.3d 710, 717–718 (Sullivan).)28 While\nthe act of keeping Shoyoye in jail despite his pointed inquiries was sufficient to support\n\n       28\n          The test for false imprisonment in jail overdetention cases established in\nSullivan “requires either that the sheriff have actual knowledge that the imprisonment of\nthe plaintiff is unlawful or alternatively that he have some notice sufficient to put him, as\na reasonable man, under a duty to investigate the validity of the incarceration.” (Sullivan,\nsupra, 12 Cal.3d at p. 719.) Shoyoye’s brief discussion of false imprisonment recites its\nrequisite elements (“ ‘(1) the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person,\n(2) without lawful privilege, and (3) for an appreciable period of time, however brief”\n(Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 958, quoting Easton v. Sutter Coast Hospital\n(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 485, 496)), and then concludes without elaboration that “[t]he\nevidence presented at trial was clearly sufficient to establish those elements.” (Shoyoye,\nat p. 958.) The court never mentions Sullivan and appears to assume there is something it\ncalls “a tort claim for negligent false imprisonment” (ibid.)—the Sullivan test is actually\nmore akin to one requiring at least gross negligence—but the result it reaches, affirming\nthe false imprisonment verdict on facts showing that plaintiff Shoyoye repeatedly brought\nhis mistaken incarceration to the attention of multiple jail employees, tracks Sullivan’s\nreasoning.\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\ftort liability, the court saw his jailers’ negligent failure to discover they were holding the\nwrong man—a mistake attributable, at bottom, to computer error—as insufficient to\nsupport Section 52.1 liability. The difference in the court’s treatment of these two claims\nis key, for any consideration of the breadth of Shoyoye’s Bane Act holding must begin\nwith the recognition that maintaining a meaningful distinction between tort and statutory\nliability was fundamental to its reading of Section 52.1.\n       When the court announces that Section 52.1 requires “coercion independent from\nthe coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself” (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 959), its focus is on whether the requisite level of scienter for Section 52.1 liability\nhad been met in a setting where the plaintiff proved negligence, at most. To support\nSection 52.1 liability in that context, the court observes, there must be “an additional\nshowing of ill will or blameworthy conduct.” (Id. at p. 958, italics added.) It found no\nevidence that while in jail “any conduct directed at [Shoyoye] was for the purpose of\ninterfering with his constitutional rights.” (Id. at p. 961, italics added.) “[Jail] employees\ncould reasonably rely on the information in the computer system, based on the reasonable\nassumption that the quality control check would catch errors.” (Ibid.) All of Shoyoye’s\ntreatment while in jail, the court concludes, was “reasonable and incident to maintaining\na jail,” and even if his jailers did something to him that might be characterized as\n“intimidation” or “coercion,” none of it was “carried out in order to effect a knowing\ninterference with [his] constitutional rights.” (Ibid., italics added.)\n       Shoyoye uses a variety of terms to describe the scienter it has in mind (see 203\nCal.App.4th at p. 958 [“intentional and callous”]; id. at p. 959 [“deliberate or spiteful”];\nid. at p. 961 [“knowing and blameworthy”]), but its analysis sheds little light on how the\nrequired level of scienter should be evaluated in unlawful arrest cases. Bender suggests\nan answer, holding that, on the facts presented there—the plaintiff was arrested without\nprobable cause, handcuffed, and then gratuitously beaten and pepper-sprayed while\noffering no resistance—constitutionally excessive force met the required standard. But in\nthe end Bender is just as opaque as Shoyoye. Ultimately, the court couches its holding in\nthe same analytical framework as Shoyoye (Bender, at p. 981 [“[w]here, as here, an arrest\nis unlawful and excessive force is applied in making the arrest, there has been coercion\n\n                                              36\n\f‘independent from the coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself,’ ”] original\nitalics), thus implicitly accepting the applicability of Shoyoye’s “independ[ence] from\ninherent coercion” test in unlawful arrest cases.\n       We agree that the use of excessive force can be enough to satisfy the “threat,\nintimidation or coercion” element of Section 52.1, but we do not accept the premise that\nShoyoye applies in unlawful arrest cases. Because, read closely, Shoyoye’s discussion of\ncoercion “independent from the coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself” was\naimed at separating tort liability from statutory liability in the specific context of a jail\noverdetention following a lawful arrest—on a record where no legally viable claim of any\nconstitutional violation was pleaded or proved—we view its “independ[ence] from\ninherent coercion” test as simply inapplicable. The case before us is not a jail\noverdetention case. A constitutionally unlawful arrest was proved, and, as noted above,\nwe have more than a simple false arrest. Under these circumstances, the better approach,\nin our view, is to focus directly on the level of scienter required to support a Section 52.1\nclaim, without the trappings of Shoyoye’s frame of analysis.\n              4.      Where an Unlawful Arrest is Properly Pleaded and Proved, the\n                      “Threat, Intimidation or Coercion” Element of Section 52.1 Requires\n                      a Specific Intent to Violate Protected Rights\n\n       We acknowledge that some courts have read Shoyoye as having announced\n“independen[ce] from inherent coercion” as a requisite element of all Section 52.1 claims\nalleging search-and-seizure violations, but we think those courts misread the statute as\nwell as the import of Venegas.29 By its plain terms, Section 52.1 proscribes any\n\n       29\n          (See, e.g., Lyall v. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2015) 807 F.3d 1178, 1196\n[“[n]umerous California decisions make clear that a plaintiff in a search-and-seizure case\nmust allege threats or coercion beyond the coercion inherent in a detention or search in\norder to recover under the Bane Act”], citing Allen, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 69\n[unlawful arrest]; Quezada v. City of Los Angeles (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 993, 1007–\n1008 [unlawful search]; Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 959.) It strikes us as an\noverstatment to say there are “numerous California decisions” for this proposition or that\nour case law is “clear“ on the point. Allen, a pleading case, and the sole published\nCalifornia appellate opinion to consider Shoyoye in any depth, ultimately holds only that\n“conclusory allegations of ‘forcible’ and ‘coercive’ interference with plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                               37\n\f“interference with” or attempted “interference with” protected rights carried out “by\nthreat, intimidation or coercion.” Nothing in the text of the statute requires that the\noffending “threat, intimidation or coercion” be “independent” from the constitutional\nviolation alleged. Indeed, if the words of the statute are given their plain meaning, the\nrequired “threat, intimidation or coercion” can never be “independent” from the\nunderlying violation or attempted violation of rights, because this element of fear-\ninducing conduct is simply the means of accomplishing the offending deed (the\n“interference” or “attempted interference”). That is clear from the structure of the statute,\nwhich reads, “If a person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interferes\nby threat, intimidation, or coercion,” a private action for redress is available. (§ 52.1,\nsubd. (a), italics added.)\n       In Venegas—which rejected a construction of Section 52.1 limiting its\napplicability to “threat[s], intimidation or coercion” against minorities and other\nstatutorily protected groups—the Supreme Court declined to place “added restrictions on\nthe scope of section 52.1” beyond its plain language, concluding that that “would appear\nto be more a legislative concern than a judicial one.” (Venegas, supra, 32 Cal.4th at\np. 843.) The same may be said here. Properly read, the statutory phrase “threat,\nintimidation or coercion” serves as an aggravator justifying the conclusion that the\nunderlying violation of rights is sufficiently egregious to warrant enhanced statutory\nremedies, beyond tort relief. We see no reason that, in addition, the required “threat,\nintimidation or coercion,” whatever form it may take, must also be transactionally\n“independent” from a properly pleaded—and proved—unlawful arrest.\n       The phrase “under color of law” indicates, without doubt, that the Legislature\nintended to include law enforcement officers within the scope of Section 52.1 if the\nrequisites of the statute are otherwise met. (See ante, fn. 17.) Much of what law\n\n\n\nconstitutional rights are inadequate to state a cause of action for a violation of section\n52.1.” (Allen, at p. 69.) Quezada refers briefly to Shoyoye’s independent from inherent\ncoercion test in a background summary of Section 52.1 law, but never applies it, relying\ninstead on the fact that no coercion at all was present in the case. (Quezada, at p. 1008).\n\n\n                                              38\n\fenforcement officers do in settings that test the limits of their authority is “inherently\ncoercive.” Given that reality, it seems to us inconsistent with an intent to bring law\nenforcement within the scope of the statute—which is what the phrase “under color of\nlaw” does—to say, categorically, even where an unlawful arrest is properly pleaded and\nproved, that “where[ever] coercion is inherent in the constitutional violation alleged, . . .\nthe statutory requirement of ‘threats, intimidation, or coercion’ is not met.” (Shoyoye,\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 959.) When applied to both lawful and unlawful conduct,\nsuch a reading of Section 52.1, in effect, creates a judicially-fashioned immunity; and not\nmerely a qualified immunity, but an absolute one covering a broad category of activity so\nlong as it may be described as “inherently coercive.”\n       In federal court, where Section 52.1 claims are frequently brought along with\nSection 1983 claims under federal pendent jurisdiction, “[t]he Bane Act’s requirement\nthat interference with rights must be accomplished by threats[,] intimidation or coercion\n‘has been the source of much debate and confusion.’ ” (McKibben v. McMahon (C.D.\nCal. Apr. 17, 2015, No. EDCV 14-02171 JGB (SPx)) 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176696, at\np. *7 (McKibben); see also K.T. v. Pittsburg Unified School Dist. (N.D. Cal. 2016) 219\nF.Supp.3d 970, 982 [“[c]ourts deciding whether the ‘threat, intimidation or coercion’\n[element of Section 52.1] must be distinct from the alleged underlying constitutional or\nstatutory violation have come out all over the map”].) We have endeavored to provide\nsome clarity.\n       In doing so, we are not obliged to follow the construction the Supreme Judicial\nCourt of Massachusetts placed on the MCRA in what appears to be some brief, fugitive\ndicta at the end of the opinion in Longval v. Commissioner of Correction (1989) 404\nMass. 325 [535 N.E.2d 588] (Longval), which Shoyoye relied upon (Shoyoye, supra, 203\nCal.App.4th at p. 960 [discussing Longval]) and which appears to be the original source\nof the confusion. (See Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 337 [“the rule of deference to\nanother state’s interpretation of a statute that provided a model for a California statute\n‘establishes . . . only a presumption of legislative intent . . . [and] even when the\npresumption properly operates it does not compel the adoption of the judicial\nconstruction of the other jurisdiction’s statute’ ”].) Longval, a qualified immunity case,\n\n                                              39\n\fgave no consideration to the text or structure of the MCRA, much less its origin in federal\ncivil rights law.30\n       Accordingly, we hold that, where, as here, an unlawful arrest is properly pleaded\nand proved, the egregiousness required by Section 52.1 is tested by whether the\ncircumstances indicate the arresting officer had a specific intent to violate the arrestee’s\nright to freedom from unreasonable seizure, not by whether the evidence shows\nsomething beyond the coercion “inherent” in the wrongful detention. (See In re M.S.,\nsupra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 713 [adopting for purposes of Pen. Code, § 422.6 the specific\nintent standard first enunciated in Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion in Screws v. United\nStates (1945) 325 U.S. 91 (Screws)]; see also People v. Lashley (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th\n938, 948–949 (Lashley).) The Screws specific intent standard has been an established\nfeature of federal civil rights law under Section 241 since the mid-1960s (United States v.\nPrice (1966) 383 U.S. 787, 792, fn. 5; United States v. Guest (1966) 383 U.S. 745, 753–\n754)31 and, as acknowledged by appellants’ counsel at oral argument, it accomplishes in\nsubstance the same thing as the independent from inherent coercion test since it ensures\nordinary negligence is not cognizable under Section 52.1.\n       We recognize, obviously, that Section 52.1 is civil, while Section 241 is criminal,\nbut in adopting the Screws standard we find it particularly significant that so much of the\n\n\n       30\n          The uncertainty engendered by Shoyoye here in California appears to be\nmirrored among courts applying Longval in Massachusetts.

It seems to us\nthat, when our Legislature enacted hate crime legislation in 1987, it chose not to adhere\nstrictly to the federal scheme by adopting a civil enforcement statute on the model of\nSection 1983, covering “deprivations” of rights and limiting the statute to public officials\nor other conduct evincing state action. Instead, it used as a model Section 241—a\ncriminal conspiracy statute—giving the statute enough breadth to reach a wide range of\n“interference” with “secured rights” by means of fear-inducing conduct, whether\nundertaken by private actors or public officials. In essence, the Legislature created a\nhybrid of the historic federal civil rights enforcement scheme, using Section 241 as a\nunitary model for criminal as well as civil enforcement. The burden of proof is\nfundamentally different in these two arenas, of course, but other than that we see no\nreason why the applicable mens rea element ought to differ.32\n\n\n       32\n          Our reading of Section 52.1 is consistent with the view taken by “the majority of\nfederal district courts in California[, which] have held [in Bane Act cases] that ‘[w]here\nFourth Amendment unreasonable seizure or excessive force claims are raised and\nintentional conduct is at issue, there is no need for a plaintiff to allege a showing of\ncoercion independent from the coercion inherent in the seizure or use of force.’ ”\n(Simmons, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 1126, quoting Dillman v. Tuolumne County (E.D.\nCal., May 7, 2013, No. 1:13–CV–00404–LJO–SKO) 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65206, at\np. *58; Morse v. County of Merced (E.D.

These courts have held\nvarious kinds of low- to mid-level force may meet the coercion element of Section 52.1.\n(See, e.g., Lawrence v. City & County of San Francisco (N.D. Cal.

(McKibben,\nsupra, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176696, at p. *8 [“coercive choice” forced upon gay,\n\n\n                                             41\n\f              5.      Application of the Specific Intent Standard\n       The application of the Screws specific intent standard here is straightforward. As\nexplained in Lashley, supra, 1 Cal.App.4th 938, which was cited with approval by our\nSupreme Court in In re M.S., supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 713, this test “ ‘essentially sets forth\ntwo requirements for a finding of “specific intent” . . . . The first is a purely legal\ndetermination. Is the . . . right at issue clearly delineated and plainly applicable under the\ncircumstances of the case?[33] If the trial judge concludes that it is, then the jury must\nmake the second, factual, determination. Did the defendant commit the act in question\nwith the particular purpose of depriving the citizen victim of his enjoyment of the\ninterests protected by that . . . right? If both requirements are met, even if the defendant\ndid not in fact recognize the [unlawfulness] of his act, he will be adjudged as a matter of\nlaw to have acted [with the requisite specific intent]—i.e., “in reckless disregard of\nconstitutional [or statutory] prohibitions or guarantees.” ’ ” (Lashley, at pp. 948–949.)\n       Applying the first step of this test here, the “right at issue” is Cornell’s federal and\nstate constitutional right to be free from arrest without probable cause. Legally, there is\nnothing vague or novel about that claim under the circumstances of this case. Viewing\nthe Phase I evidence in the light most favorable to Cornell, the protected right he asserts\nwas “clearly delineated and plainly applicable.” Thus, we reject appellants’ contention\n\n\nbisexual or transgender inmates to accept segregated housing with fewer privileges than\nother inmates]; M.H. v. County of Alameda (N.D. Cal. 2013) 90 F.Supp.3d 889, 898\n[deliberate indifference to prisoner’s medical needs].) These cases stand in stark contrast\nto others that apply the independent from inherent coercion test—in our view\nincorrectly—outside the confines of jail overdetention, taking that test to the limit of its\nlogic. (See, e.g., Bordegaray v. County of Santa Barbara (C.D. Cal. 2016) 2016 U.S.\nDist. Lexis 172269, at pp.*39–41 [evidence of constitutionally excessive force in police\nshooting case held insufficient to support Section 52.1 claim because, other than being\nshot, the plaintiff failed to show any “threat, intimidation or coercion”].)\n       33\n          By way of illustration, we observe that the Section 52.1 claim in Shoyoye likely\nwould have not have met this first step of the specific intent standard because the plaintiff\nin that case appears to have alleged no viable theory of constitutional violation. (See fn.\n27, ante.) The same is true of a recent case applying Shoyoye, Julian v. Mission\nCommunity Hospital (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 360, 395 (“other than the actions necessary\nto detain [plaintiff], which the police had probable cause to take, [plaintiff] alleged\nwithout explanation that the police defendants ‘engaged in tactics to scare’ her”).\n\n                                              42\n\fthat, as a matter of law, the Section 52.1 claim never should have been submitted to the\njury. The second requirement, a question of fact, is whether appellants acted with the\n“particular purpose” of depriving Cornell of his right to be free from arrest without\nprobable cause. Subjective “spite” was relevant here, along with all of the objective\ncircumstances surrounding the unlawful arrest, both before it and after it. But whether\nthe appellant officers understood they were acting unlawfully was not a requirement.\nReckless disregard of the “right at issue” is all that was necessary.\n       In Phase II, the jury was instructed that “Plaintiff Cornell claims . . . Defendants\nBrandt and Gin intentionally interfered with or attempted to interfere with his civil rights\nby threats, intimidation, or coercion.” According to the jury instructions, to return a\nverdict for Cornell on the Section 52.1 claim, the jury was required to find that he proved\n“all of the following: [¶] 1. That the Defendant made threats of violence against Plaintiff\ncausing Plaintiff to reasonably believe that if he exercised his right to be free from\nunlawful detention or unlawful arrest, Defendant would commit violence against him and\nthat Defendant had the apparent ability to carry out the threats; [¶] 2. That Plaintiff was\nharmed; and [¶] 3. That the Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing\nPlaintiff’s harm.” (CACI No. 3066.) These instructions properly focused the jury on\nintentional violation of Cornell’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure.\n       Although Cornell’s primary theory at trial was that the gun-pointing made his false\narrest particularly egregious (hence the focus on “threats of violence” in the instructions),\nit must be borne in mind that he also submitted proof that the harm he suffered from the\narrest—his job loss, in particular—was inflicted out of spite. Considering the evidence\nsurrounding Cornell’s arrest in its full context, it seems to us a rational jury could have\nconcluded not only that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin were unconcerned from the\noutset with whether there was legal cause to detain or arrest him, but that when they\nrealized their error, they doubled-down on it, knowing they were inflicting grievous\ninjury on their prisoner. On this reading of the evidence, these two officers had every\nopportunity to exercise restraint as it became clearer and clearer that their initial\nsuspicions of Cornell were unfounded, but rather than let the matter go when they finally\nreleased him, they retaliated against him as a way of undermining his ability to claim to\n\n                                              43\n\fsuperiors he was arrested without probable cause. This apparent effort to obstruct\nCornell’s ability to assert his right to freedom from unreasonable seizure violated Section\n52.1 just as surely as his actual arrest did, while compounding the harm. On this record,\nwe have no trouble concluding the specific intent standard was met.34\n                                 III.   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment and the award of attorney’s fees and costs are affirmed. Respondent\nshall recover costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n           Appellants present no separate argument in support of their appeal of the award\nof statutory attorney’s fees and costs, apart from the contention that the Section 52.1\nverdict should be reversed. Having concluded there is no infirmity in the Section 52.1\nverdict, we will sustain the accompanying award of fees and costs. Appellants also\nsuggest in their reply brief that they seek to appeal from the judgment on the negligence\nand interference with economic advantage claims, but there, too, they present no separate\nargument and thus they have waived any defect in the judgment insofar as it rests on\nliability for those claims.\n\n                                            44\n\f                                             _________________________\n                                             Streeter, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRuvolo, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nRivera, J.\n\n\n\n\nA141016, A142147/Cornell v.

Ct. No. CGC11509240)\n        Defendants and Appellants.\n\n\n        Police officer trainee Bret Cornell, while off-duty and in street clothes, went for a\nrun one morning in Golden Gate Park, stopping for a brief rest on a knoll called Hippie\nHill. Two uniformed patrol officers in the area spotted him, thought he looked\n“worried,” and grew suspicious because the bushes on Hippie Hill are known for illicit\ndrug activity. As the patrolmen began to approach Cornell, but before they reached him\nor said anything to him, he resumed his run. The officers gave chase, joined in pursuit by\ntwo other officers who responded to a call for backup. One of the officers, with his gun\ndrawn, eventually caught up to Cornell on a trail in some nearby woods.\n        Cornell claims he had no idea he was being chased or that the officers wished to\nspeak with him. On the trail, he says he heard a shout from behind, “I will shoot you,”\nand looked over his shoulder to see a dark figure pointing a gun at him. He darted away,\nultimately finding what he thought was refuge with a police officer awaiting his arrival\nsome distance away at the top of a stairway in AIDS Memorial Grove. But to his surprise\nwhen he arrived there, that officer ordered him to the ground. He was arrested at gun-\npoint and searched, taken in handcuffs to a stationhouse for interrogation, and eventually\nto a hospital for a drug test, which was negative.\n\n                                               1\n\f       In the meantime, a team of officers went back to Golden Gate Park, spoke to\npeople who had seen Cornell that morning, and conducted a search of the areas where he\nwas known to have been, and of his parked truck. No evidence of involvement with\ndrugs turned up, and after nearly six hours in custody, Cornell was released. As he was\nleaving the stationhouse, he was given a criminal citation for evading arrest in violation\nof Penal Code section 148. Other than cursory questioning by the officers who issued the\ncitation, no one in a position of higher authority ever interviewed him or asked for his\nside of the story. Cornell was never prosecuted, but he lost his job as a result of the arrest\nand citation.\n       To recover for the damage done to him, Cornell sued the four arresting officers,\nthe Chief of Police, and the City and County of San Francisco. Following phase one of a\nbifurcated jury trial on special verdict forms, the trial court, relying on findings of fact by\nthe jury in the initial phase, determined that Cornell was arrested without probable cause,\nthereby establishing liability for false arrest, and prompting the defense to stipulate to\nliability for negligence. In phase two, the jury returned a verdict for Cornell on two\nremaining claims, tortious interference with economic advantage, and violation of Civil\nCode section 52.1 (Section 52.1), awarding total damages of $575,231. Following trial,\nthe court added $2,027,612.75 in attorney’s fees and costs on the Section 52.1 claim.\n       These consolidated appeals are from the ensuing judgment and the award of\nattorney’s fees and costs. The appellants argue 1) as a matter of law, the jury’s phase one\nfindings do not support the trial court’s determination that probable cause was lacking,\n2) the trial court should have declared a mistrial when the jury deadlocked on one of 18\nquestions put to it in the phase one special verdict form, 3) the trial court failed to address\ntheir argument that, under Penal Code section 847, subdivision (b), they are immune from\nclaims for false arrest, and 4) even if the verdict on the tort claims is upheld, the Section\n52.1 verdict and accompanying award of fees and costs must be reversed because there\nwas insufficient evidence to submit that claim to the jury.\n       Seeing no error, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f                                   I.   BACKGROUND\n       A.     The Evidence at Trial\n       In July 2010, Bret Cornell, a recent graduate of the police academy employed by\nthe San Francisco Police Department as a field officer trainee, went for a morning jog in\nGolden Gate Park at around 7:00 a.m., after finishing a night shift. He was dressed in\ngray canvas pants cut off at mid-ankle, a plaid fleece jacket over a dark t-shirt, and\nrunning shoes. After running a considerable distance, at around 8:00 a.m., he ran across\nSharon Meadow and stopped to rest at the top of Hippie Hill, just as a police cruiser\ndrove through the trees up to the crest of the hill along a pedestrian pathway. He looked\nat the car, and not wanting to interfere with whatever the officers were doing, walked\ndown to the bottom of the hill.1\n       The two uniformed officers in the cruiser, David Brandt and Richard “Brett”\nBodisco, considered Hippie Hill to be a high crime area. Both officers had made\nnumerous narcotics arrests there, mostly involving drug transactions in the bushes, and\nthere had been a homicide in the park a few days earlier. According to Officers Brandt\nand Bodisco, they drove up the pathway to gauge the reaction of people on the other side\nof the crest who could not see them coming. Cornell, a stranger to the officers, glanced at\ntheir car when they came into view, and then looked away. Cornell was by himself, not\ntalking to anyone, had nothing in his hands, and was not doing anything specific to\narouse suspicion. Officer Brandt described Cornell as having a “clean-cut” look, which\nhe said was consistent with someone who was a recent parolee.2 Because Cornell\n\n       1\n         Cornell testified that when he saw the officers’ car, he thought it “odd” they were\ndriving on a pedestrian path, “figured . . . they were doing some kind of official\noperation,” and wanted to avoid them because “I didn’t need to get myself involved in\nany official operations” while off-duty. He explained that “in field training we are not\nallowed to have any off-duty contact. We are not supposed to be getting involved in\nofficial police matters if we can avoid it.”\n       2\n        On cross-examination, Officer Brandt admitted Cornell’s appearance was also\nconsistent with that of a recent graduate of the police academy.\n\n                                              3\n\fappeared to be “worried” in their presence, Officers Brandt and Bodisco turned their car\ntoward him and decided to initiate a consensual encounter. They did not activate their\nlights, or say anything to him over their loudspeaker.\n       As the officers turned toward Cornell, and as he walked away from them, headed\ndownhill, he looked back briefly in their direction and then began running. With their\nsuspicions aroused, the officers decided to chase Cornell and detain him. Officer\nBodisco jumped out of the car and made a radio call for backup to assist in setting up a\nperimeter to cut Cornell off from any escape. The call, which drew the assistance of two\nmore uniformed officers, Jesse Farrell and Sergeant Wallace Gin, included a description\nof Cornell and the direction he was headed, but no other details. When Officer Bodisco’s\ncall for backup went out, the police dispatcher asked “What’s the want?” Officer\nBodisco responded, simply, “[R]unning.” According to Officer Brandt, the call gave no\nspecifics because at that point “we didn’t have anything specific.” Surveying the area\nfrom the top of the hill to see where Cornell went, Officer Bodisco testified he saw\nCornell go off path through some bushes, reappearing below the hill without his plaid\njacket and wearing only a dark shirt, which the officers took to be an attempt to throw\nthem off his track.\n       When Cornell left Hippie Hill, he was unaware the officers wanted him to stop.\nHis explanation for discarding his fleece jacket was that, after an hour’s run, he was\nfeeling hot. Having unsuccessfully tried to tie his fleece jacket around his waist while\nrunning at an earlier point on his route, he folded it and placed it on a tree stump to\nretrieve later. He said he had done that before and had no problem with anyone taking it,\nand even if someone did take it, the garment was inexpensive and easily replaceable.\nOnce the officers caught sight of Cornell from their vantage point on Hippie Hill, Officer\nBodisco set out after him on foot. Officer Brandt, still in the cruiser, drove down and\naround the hill, past some tennis courts, and along nearby Bowling Green Drive. As he\ndrove, Officer Brandt stopped to ask two people along the way if they had seen someone\n\n\n                                              4\n\fmatching Cornell’s description; one person claimed to have seen someone running near\nthe tennis courts, and another said he had heard some rustling in bushes up a winding dirt\ntrail nearby.\n       Continuing in the direction these park users pointed out, Officer Brandt’s search\ntook him to the bottom of a trail known as the High Path, a dirt pathway lined on both\nsides by trees and brush, leading up a hill beyond Bowling Green Drive at the entrance to\nthe AIDS Memorial Grove. Officer Farrell arrived and joined Officer Brandt at the\nbottom of the High Path, and the two of them began proceeding up the trail, with Officer\nBrandt in the lead. Officer Brandt described the trail as dark and having a “cave[-like]\nappearance.” He unholstered his gun at this point and held it in a “low ready” position,\nnot because of any specific threat, but because of “fear of the unknown.” Officer Farrell,\nfor his part, perceiving no threat, left his gun holstered.\n       Officer Brandt caught sight of Cornell walking up ahead and eventually came\nclose enough to confront him. Officer Farrell was directly behind Officer Brandt, could\nsee that Cornell appeared to be “clean cut,” was not armed, had nothing in his hands, and\nwas doing nothing threatening. Officer Brandt shouted something at Cornell. Both\nofficers recall Officer Brandt unmistakably ordering Cornell to stop at that point,3\ncausing Cornell to pause, half turn in their direction, look at them squarely, and then dash\naway at full speed, taking a route downhill through the trees in a clear effort to evade\ncapture.\n       Cornell—who testified he still had no idea he was being pursued by police officers\nduring the encounter on the High Path—said he heard a “disturbance” behind him and\nthen heard the words “I will shoot you,” which prompted him to glance over his shoulder\nand see a dark figure pointing a gun. He said he took off sprinting in desperate flight\n       3\n         What exactly Officer Brandt shouted was disputed (Officer Brandt—“stop[,]\npolice”; Farrell—“some sort of command,” cannot recall exact words; Cornell—“I will\nshoot you,” and did not think whoever said it was a police officer because “I will shoot\nyou” is not an appropriate police command), but there is no dispute he yelled at least the\nwords “I will shoot you.”\n\n                                               5\n\ffrom an unknown, armed attacker, and then tripped and fell down a steeply pitched slope\nthrough some trees, tumbling into the AIDS Memorial Grove. Standing at the top of a\nstairway across the meadow from where Cornell landed was Sergeant Gin. Cornell began\nto run toward the stairway, thinking he had found protection from the unknown assailant\nwho had just accosted him on the High Path. To Cornell’s surprise when he reached the\nbottom of the stairway, Sergeant Gin ordered him to stop and put his hands up.\n       At this point, Cornell surrendered without any protest or struggle. He raised his\nhands as directed, but Sergeant Gin testified that as Cornell began walking up the stairs\nhe lowered his right hand to shoulder height, at which point Sergeant Gin drew his gun\nand ordered him to the ground. Cornell again complied. As he lay prone on the steps,\nOfficers Bodisco, Brandt and Farrell arrived, and Officer Bodisco handcuffed him, with\nthe cuffs binding his hands behind his back. Cornell remained cooperative and compliant\nthroughout the handcuffing process.\n       Upon being handcuffed, Cornell was not advised he was under arrest or the basis\nof the arrest. None of the officers dispute, however, that he was under arrest. Having\nmade the arrest, the officers conducted a full search incident-to-arrest. The search turned\nup nothing except Cornell’s police identification and a standard-issue set of handcuffs in\nhis back pocket. It was not until this point—some seven minutes after the initial\nencounter on Hippie Hill—that Cornell told the arresting officers he was a police officer\nand that he was just out for a run. When asked where his gun was, Cornell said it was in\nhis truck, which was parked near Stowe Lake. Sergeant Gin decided at this point to take\nCornell to Park Station for further interrogation. Cornell was then escorted up the steps\nand loaded into the back of a transport wagon, still bound in handcuffs behind his back.\n       As Cornell was being driven to Park Station, he began to feel light-headed, had\ntrouble breathing, and he requested a double set of handcuffs to relieve discomfort. He\nrepeatedly asked the driver for assistance, but was ignored. After the transport wagon\nleft, headed for Park Station, several officers conducted a search in Golden Gate Park,\n\n\n                                             6\n\flooking for incriminating evidence. They found Cornell’s plaid jacket discarded in the\nbushes, but there was nothing in it. They also located Cornell’s truck, which was parked\non Conservatory Drive, some distance from Stowe Lake where Cornell said he parked it;\nhis gun was inside, where he had indicated it could be found.\n       Upon arrival at Park Station, Cornell still had not been told why he was under\narrest. Officers Bodisco and Brandt surreptitiously recorded an interview of him and\nduring the questioning Officer Brandt told Cornell “[y]ou’re going to end up hanging\nyourself pretty hard by lying. I can tell you that right now.” Cornell’s repeated question,\n“What’s the charge?,” went unanswered. Responding to Cornell’s insistence that he had\nbeen unaware he was being pursued by police and that no officer ever issued a command\nto stop running, Officer Brandt accused him of being a “professional”—meaning\nsomeone who has an “extensive history of criminal misconduct” who seeks to “work the\nsystem for their benefit”—and brushed off Cornell’s denial of wrongdoing with the\ncomment, “you can talk to them downtown.”\n       While held in custody at Park Station, Cornell was handcuffed to a bench in full\nview of many officers, the “entire watch” as he put it, and he overheard several of them\nchuckling about him being a field officer trainee, which elicited comments such as “not\nanymore” and “another one bites the dust.” Cornell continued to report being in physical\ndistress while at Park Station, so paramedics were called, and he was taken to a hospital.\nIn the ambulance, while the paramedics were taking Cornell to the hospital, Officer\nBrandt arranged to place a hidden audio recording device near him, “because [he] might\nsay something stupid.” The recording captured nothing incriminating. At the hospital, a\nsample of Cornell’s blood was taken and tested for the presence of narcotics. The blood\ndraw was negative.\n       Upon receiving medical clearance at the hospital, Cornell was returned to Park\nStation, where he was eventually released at 1:50 p.m., after nearly six hours in custody.\nWhile processing him for release, Officer Brandt said to Cornell “you know the drill” and\n\n\n                                             7\n\fhanded him a misdemeanor citation accusing him of violating Penal Code section 148,\nsubdivision (a), for resisting or delaying an officer in the course of his duties. The\ncitation, signed by Officer Bodisco, and approved by Sergeant Gin, specified Hippie Hill\nas the location of the offense. No criminal charges were ever brought, but two days later,\npursuant to a policy requiring termination for misconduct of any officer trainee—trainees\nare probationary employees—the San Francisco Police Department summarily released\nCornell from its employ, ending his career as a San Francisco police officer and\neffectively disqualifying him from obtaining a law enforcement position with other\ndepartments or agencies.\n       B.     Claims and Trial Proceedings\n       Cornell brought this action against Officers Brandt, Bodisco and Farrell, Sergeant\nGin, San Francisco Police Chief George Gascon, and the City and County of San\nFrancisco (the City). In his complaint, as amended, he pleaded claims for violation of\nSection 52.1, negligence, assault and battery, false arrest and imprisonment, and tortious\ninterference with contract and/or economic advantage.4 The remaining defendants at\ntrial—and the appellants here—were Officer Brandt, Officer Bodisco, Officer Farrell,\nSergeant Gin, and the City.\n       The case was tried to a jury over the course of 23 trial days in October and\nNovember 2013. At the close of the evidence, jury deliberations were bifurcated into two\nphases, with the first phase addressing the claims of assault and false arrest. A special\nverdict form for Phase I presented a series of 18 questions, beginning with a question\nasking the jury to decide whether Cornell had proved his assault claim, followed by a\n\n       4\n          Prior to trial, the court granted summary judgment to Chief Gascon because there\nwas no evidence of his personal involvement in the alleged acts giving rise to liability. It\ninitially granted summary adjudication to all defendants on Cornell’s Section 52.1 claim,\nbut due to an intervening change in the applicable law, reconsidered that ruling and\ngranted Cornell leave to amend, resulting in a second amended complaint upon which the\ncase was tried.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fseries of 17 factual questions pertinent to the legal issue of probable cause to arrest.5 The\ncourt adopted this bifurcated mode of submitting the case to the jury based on the\nexpectation that the Phase I findings would dictate what, if anything, remained to be\ndecided in Phase II.\n       After a day and a half of Phase I deliberations, the jury reported being “hopelessly\nstuck” on two of the questions submitted to it. The court admonished the jury to keep\ntrying. Late that afternoon, a Friday, the jury again reported it was still stuck on two\nquestions, this time adding that there was “no other testimony or evidence that will\nchange any of our minds.” With the jury at an impasse, the court recessed for the\nweekend, after first excusing a juror who had a schedule conflict and substituting an\n\n\n       5\n          The specific questions, crafted jointly by the parties with input from the court,\nwere as follows: (1) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant\nassaulted plaintiff? (2) Did either or both Officer Brandt or Bodisco see Cornell running\nacross Sharon Meadow before they saw him on Hippie Hill? (3) Was Hippie Hill known\nto Officer Brandt and Bodisco as a high crime area? (4) Was it reasonable for the officers\nto believe that Cornell had come out of the bushes on Hippie Hill? (5) Did the officers\nhave knowledge of the types of criminal activity in the Hippie Hill area that could lead\nthem to believe that Cornell may be involved in criminal activity near Hippie Hill?\n(6) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell appeared nervous or evasive on\nHippie Hill because of the presence of the officers? (7) Did the officers do or say\nanything on Hippie Hill that would have communicated to Cornell that they wanted to\ncontact him? (8) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell fled from them on\nHippie Hill? (9) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell removed his jacket to\nchange his appearance in order to avoid detention? (10) Did the officers observe Cornell\nrun off trail through the bushes? (11) Were Officer Brandt’s only words said to Cornell,\n“I will shoot you!”? (12) Did Officer Brandt or Farrell do or say anything on the path\nabove the AIDS Memorial Grove that would have communicated to Cornell that they\nwanted him to stop? (13) Did the officers see Cornell glance back on the path above the\nAIDS Memorial Grove? (14) Did the officers reasonably believe that Cornell knew or\nshould have known that they were police officers? (15) Did Officer Farrell see Officer\nBrandt pointing his gun in Cornell’s direction? (16) Would an objectively reasonable\nofficer believe that Cornell ran away from Officer Brandt in order to resist the use of\nunreasonable force? (17) Did Cornell go down the hill into the Grove accidentally or\nintentionally? (18) Was it reasonable for the officers to believe that Cornell went down\nthe hill into the Grove with the intent of evading them?\n\n\n                                              9\n\falternate juror. The reconstituted jury began deliberations anew the following week, but\nafter two additional days of deliberating, remained hung, though on only one question.\nThe court decided to take the Phase I verdict at that point despite the unanswered\nquestion, over an objection from the defense.6\n       In its Phase I verdict, the jury found unambiguously for the appellants on the\nassault claim. Beyond that, however, the results were mixed, with some findings tending\nto favor the officers’ version of events, and some findings tending to favor Cornell’s\nversion. In the findings favorable to Cornell, the jury found that Officers Brandt and\nBodisco never said anything or otherwise communicated to Cornell their desire to speak\nto him on Hippie Hill; that it was not reasonable for them to believe Cornell had come\nout of the bushes on Hippie Hill; and that, contrary to Officer Bodisco’s testimony, they\ndid not see Cornell run off trail through the bushes when he left Hippie Hill. The jury\ndeadlocked on the question whether it was reasonable for Officers Brandt and Bodisco to\nbelieve Cornell fled from them on Hippie Hill.\n       In the findings favoring the defense, on the other hand, the jury found that Officers\nBodisco and Brandt considered Hippie Hill to be a high crime area; that the officers’\nknowledge of the types of crimes committed there “could lead them to suspect” Cornell\nmay have been engaged in criminal activity; that the officers reasonably believed that\nCornell appeared “nervous or evasive” when he saw them; that they reasonably believed\nCornell shed his jacket in an effort to avoid being detected; that when Officers Brandt\nand Farrell encountered Cornell on the High Path, they reasonably believed he knew they\nwere police officers; that a reasonable officer would not have believed Cornell was\nfleeing from the use of unreasonable force against him by Officer Brandt; that, contrary\n\n\n       6\n         Defense counsel objected “for the record” to this procedure and insisted upon\nanswers to all of the Phase I special verdict questions. In a colloquy with the court when\nthe jury first reported an impasse on November 8, counsel had previously taken the\nposition the court had discretion to decide “what facts the Court needs to make” a\nprobable cause determination.\n\n                                            10\n\fto Cornell’s testimony, he went down the hill from the High Path into the AIDS\nMemorial Grove intentionally, not accidentally; and that it was reasonable for the officers\nto believe he was trying to evade capture in doing so.\n         Based on the jury’s Phase I findings, the court ruled as a matter of law that\ndefendants did not have reasonable suspicion to detain Cornell and that he was arrested\nwithout probable cause. In the hiatus between Phases I and II, the defense stipulated to\nliability on the part of all defendants on the negligence claim, leaving only the tortious\ninterference with economic advantage claim and the Section 52.1 claim for decision in\nPhase II. Moving on to the next phase of the jury deliberations, the court posed a series\nof Phase II questions pertaining to these two claims and to issues of causation and\ndamages on all claims. With liability for false arrest and negligence established in Phase\nI, the jury returned a Phase II special verdict finding liability on the tortious interference\nand Section 52.1 claims,7 awarding total damages of $575,231, including $234,007 in\npast economic damages, $266,224 in future economic damages, and $75,000 in past non-\neconomic damages, with judgment entered accordingly.8 The court then granted\nCornell’s motion to tax costs, awarding him $2,027,612.75 in attorney’s fees under\nSection 52.1.\n         These timely appeals followed, from the judgment and from the attorney’s fee\naward.\n\n\n\n\n         8\n         In the Phase II verdicts, the jury found liability against only Officers Brandt and\nBodisco on the intentional interference claim and against only Officer Brandt and\nSergeant Gin on the Section 52.1 claim. Based on the verdicts for Phase I and Phase II\nand on the stipulation by all appellants to liability for negligence, judgment was entered\nagainst all appellants on the false arrest claim and the negligence claim, against Officer\nBrandt, Sergeant Gin and the City on the Section 52.1 claim, against Officers Brandt and\nBodisco on the intentional interference with economic relations claim, and in favor of all\nappellants on the assault claim. The judgment awards the total damages jointly and\nseverally against all appellants.\n\n                                              11\n\f                                    II.     DISCUSSION\n       A.      Probable Cause to Arrest\n\n       Where the facts are not in conflict, the issue of probable cause is a question of law\nreviewable de novo on appeal. (Giannis v.

We look to\nwhether facts known to the arresting officer “at the moment the arrest was made” (Beck v.\nOhio (1964) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90) “ ‘would persuade someone of “reasonable caution” that\nthe person to be arrested has committed a crime.’ ” (People v.

United States (1949) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104716\"><a href=\"/opinion/104716/brinegar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176) and is not governed by courtroom standards of proof. (Ibid.) Many verbal\nformulae have been used to describe it, but distilled to their essence “ ‘[t]he substance of\nall the definitions . . . is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt’ ” (id. at p. 175), where the\nbelief is “particularized with respect to the person to be . . . seized.” (People v.\nThompson (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639507/people-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818.)\n       The legal standard we apply to assess probable cause is an objective one in which\nthe subjective motivations of the arresting officers have no role. (Whren v. United States\n(1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813; Gillan v.

But it is an\noverstatement to say that what is in the mind of an arresting officer is wholly irrelevant,\nfor the objective test of reasonableness is simply a measure by which we assess whether\nthe circumstances as subjectively perceived by the officer provide a reasonable basis for\nthe seizure. (Agar v. Superior Court (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29; see Devenpeck v.\nAlford (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137733\"><a href=\"/opinion/137733/devenpeck-v-alford/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153.)\n       Of course, temporary detention on grounds short of probable cause is also\nconstitutionally permissible in some circumstances. (Terry v. Ohio (1968) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n20–21, 27.) A “brief, investigatory stop” is justified where an officer has “reasonable,\narticulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot,” implicating the suspect. (Illinois v.\n\n                                               12\n\fWardlow (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118326\"><a href=\"/opinion/118326/illinois-v-wardlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (Wardlow); see In re Tony C.

While the more demanding standard of probable cause requires a basis to suspect\nsomeone of having committed a particular crime, reasonable suspicion to detain only\nrequires facts connecting the suspect to “criminal activity” more generally. (People v.\nCampbell (1981) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594.) Like the probable cause determination, the\napplicable test courts use to assess reasonable suspicion is an objective one, specific to\nthe detainee. (People v. Perrusquia (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233.)\n       Our Supreme Court recently explained that “ ‘[a] detention is reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable facts that,\nconsidered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective\nmanifestation that the person detained may be involved in criminal activity.’ [Citation.]\nSuch reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on factors unrelated to the defendant,\nsuch as criminal activity in the area.” (People v. Casares (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837–\n838 (Casares).) Reasonable suspicion must rest on objective particulars tying a\nparticular person to criminal activity, rather than on a mere “hunch” that something is\nodd or unusual about the person detained. (Id. at p. 838; see People v. Bower (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187451\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187451/people-v-bower/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647 [officer’s suspicions about white man found late at night in a “high\ncrime,” largely black neighborhood insufficient to justify detention where the officer\ntestified he had never seen a white person in that area at that time “for an innocent\npurpose”].)\n       Cornell was arrested for the offense of “willfully resist[ing], delay[ing], or\nobstruct[ing] [a] . . . peace officer . . . in the discharge . . . [of a] duty of his or her office”\nunder Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a). To violate this statute, the obstructive\nconduct must impede the lawful performance of an officer’s duty. (People v. Curtis\n(1969) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354; People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1540</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1543.)\nThus, the analysis here focuses, at its core, on whether there was reasonable suspicion\njustifying Cornell’s detention at any point between the time he was spotted on Hippie Hill\nand the time he was arrested in AIDS Memorial Grove. If there was not, Officers Brandt\nand Bodisco—and their fellow officers, since all of the officers involved in pursuing\nCornell constructively shared the same pool of information under the collective\n\n                                                 13\n\fknowledge doctrine9—were acting outside the lawful course of their duties when they\nsought to detain him. That analysis drives the probable cause analysis, for if there was no\nobjectively reasonable basis to believe Cornell had violated Penal Code section 148,\nsubdivision (a) or any other law, probable cause to arrest was lacking as well. (Casares,\nsupra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 838 [“The detention being unlawful, the subsequent searches of\ndefendant’s person and the car he had been sitting in were also unlawful.”].)\n       We agree with the trial court that there was no reasonable suspicion to detain and\nhence no probable cause to arrest. This incident took place in broad daylight in one of\nthe most heavily used public recreation areas in San Francisco. The jury found that when\nthe chase commenced, Officers Brandt and Bodisco knew little more than that they had\nseen Cornell at a location where drug crimes often took place, but with nothing\nconnecting him to any criminal activity. The man had nothing in his hands, made no\nfurtive movements, and was speaking to no one. Nothing about the way he was dressed\nindicated he might be hiding something under his clothing, and Officers Brandt and\nBodisco gave him no directions that he disobeyed. (See Casares, supra, 62 Cal.4th at\np. 838 [“[officer] described no furtive movement or other behavior by defendant\nsuggestive of criminal activity”].) They did not claim they recognized Cornell as\nsomeone with previous involvement in criminal activity. They had no tip that a drug\ntransaction was about to take place in which he fit the description of someone likely to be\ninvolved. And they saw no activity on Hippie Hill, by anyone, indicating that drug\nactivity was currently taking place or about to take place there.\n       On the strength of testimony from Officer Bodisco that Cornell “looked worried”\nand avoided making eye contact with him and his partner, the jury found the officers\nreasonably believed Cornell seemed “nervous or evasive.” But “ ‘[l]ooking at a police\nofficer and then looking away does not provide the officer with “a particularized and\nobjective basis for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity.” ’ ” (People v.\nPitts (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Because these two officers had insufficient\ninformation to do anything more than seek a consensual encounter with Cornell as they\nwatched him on Hippie Hill (see Casares, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 838 [“when . . . officer\ninitiated the identification procedure, . . . he had no factual basis for a reasonable\nsuspicion, as opposed to a mere hunch, that defendant was then engaged in any criminal\nactivity”]), the critical sequence of events took place when the chase began. At that\npoint, as Officers Brandt and Bodisco turned their car toward Cornell—without saying\nanything over their loudspeaker or otherwise signaling an intent to approach—Cornell\nwas already walking away, which he was entitled to do. (See People v. Souza (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614076\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614076/people-v-souza/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234 (Souza) [“a person approached by police for questioning may decline to\nanswer the questions and ‘may go on his way’ ”].) Even assuming Cornell was\ndeliberately trying to avoid Officers Brandt and Bodisco as he ran off, that did not change\nthings. Not every effort to avoid an encounter with police warrants detention. If it did,\nanyone who turns off the freeway in haste after spotting a police car in the rearview\nmirror could be stopped for trying to avoid being pulled over.\n       Pointing to the fact Cornell shed his jacket after starting to run, a move the jury\nfound gave Officers Brandt and Bodisco reasonable grounds to believe he was trying to\n“avoid detection,” appellants emphasize that evasive flight can provide reasonable\nsuspicion, especially when the experience of officers with crime in a particular area\nconnects a fleeing person to illicit activity. It is true that, in a high crime area,\n“unprovoked flight upon noticing the police” may provide reasonable suspicion in some\ncircumstances (Wardlow, supra, 528 U.S. at p. 124), and that “headlong flight wherever\n\n                                               15\n\fit occurs”—which can be considered the “consummate act of evasion”—will justify a\nstop. (Ibid.) But the High Court has declined to adopt a “ ‘bright-line rule’ authorizing\nthe temporary detention of anyone who flees at the mere sight of a police officer.” (Id. at\np. 126 (conc. & dis. opn. of Stevens, J.)), favoring instead a totality of the circumstances\napproach that requires consideration of flight along with other objective indicators\nconnecting a suspect to criminal activity. (See also Souza, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 239\n[“No single fact—for instance, flight from approaching police—can be indicative in all\ndetention cases of involvement in criminal conduct. Time, locality, lighting conditions,\nand an area’s reputation for criminal activity all give meaning to a particular act of flight,\nand may or may not suggest to a trained officer that the fleeing person is involved in\ncriminal activity. Consequently, a ‘bright-line’ rule applicable to all investigatory stops\n. . . would be improper.”].)\n       What is important here is whether the circumstances known to the officers, in\ntotality, connected Cornell to suspected criminal activity, not whether, as a standalone\nmatter, they perceived him to be fleeing from them when he began to run. The jury made\nno finding, and there was no evidence, that Cornell was carrying something Officers\nBrandt and Bodisco thought could be contraband and discarded it as he ran. Nor was\nthere any finding that Cornell was desperate, panicked or in “[h]eadlong flight”\n(Wardlow, supra, 528 U.S. at p. 124), suggesting consciousness of guilt. The special\nverdict questions bearing on how Cornell ran, to be sure, are somewhat ambiguous, but in\ninterpreting them—after considering the same evidence the jury did—the trial court’s\nultimate legal conclusion shows it read the findings as accepting Cornell’s version of\nwhat happened at the start of the chase (after a “cool down” break he resumed his run\nalong a pedestrian path, removed his jacket while running, and took enough time along\nthe path to fold it and place it on a nearby stump), rather than the officers’ version (he\nsuddenly broke into a “full blown sprint,” ran off-trail, and “dumped” his jacket while\nrunning through the bushes).10 Because the findings suggest the jury saw key details in\n\n       10\n         The trial court’s function is to draw legal conclusions from the facts found by\nspecial verdict (Code Civ. Proc., § 624), and, unless the findings are incomplete,\n\n\n                                              16\n\fthe officers’ reported perceptions of Cornell at this crucial juncture as embellishments,\nwe see no reason to disagree that the more benign view of the facts known to them is the\nbest interpretation of what the jury found.11\n       Appellants rely heavily on People v. Rodriguez, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1540</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nwhere a man jumped from a car and ran from an officer who was attempting to make a\nstop. Another officer who heard a radio broadcast about the fleeing suspect saw him a\nminute later, walking nearby. The second officer shined a spotlight on the suspect and\ngot out of his patrol car, at which point the suspect sprinted away, crossing traffic lanes,\nreaching into his pocket while he ran, and then throwing an item over a chain-link fence.\nUpon being chased down and detained, the suspect admitted he “knew he was running\nfrom a police officer” but ran because he had “an outstanding warrant and a digital scale\nin his pocket.” (Id. at p. 1543.) On these facts the court concluded there was more than\nenough justification to detain, closing its opinion with the remark, “This is not a case\nwhere appellant was out for an evening jog.” (Id. at p. 1544, italics added.) Here,\nnothing contradicts Cornell’s testimony that he was, in fact, out for a jog. Nor are there\nany of the particulars we see in Rodriguez, where the officers had cause to detain at the\noutset—in the traffic stop—which led the suspect to flee at a full sprint, putting himself at\nrisk in traffic while he ran.\n       Shifting their focus slightly, appellants point to Cornell’s later actions on the High\nPath, where he defied an order to stop and launched into a sprint through the woods with\n\n\ninconsistent or “hopelessly ambiguous”—which is not the case here—the court may\ninterpret the verdict in view of the pleadings, evidence and instructions. (Woodcock v.\nFontana Scaffolding & Equipment Co.

(Ibid.)\n       11\n          The jury answered “No” to Question No. 10, which indicates it did not find\ncredible the testimony from Officer Bodisco that Cornell ran off-trail through the bushes,\nconsistent with its earlier “No” response to Question No. 4, indicating it had also rejected\nthe officers’ testimony that they believed Cornell emerged from the bushes at the top of\nHippie Hill when they first saw him.\n\n                                                17\n\fdesperate abandon, scrambling down the side of a hill into the AIDS Memorial Grove.\nThis sequence of events on the High Path, they say, was part of a fluid series of events\nleading up to the moment of arrest. By then, appellants contend, the jury’s findings\nestablish without doubt that Cornell was in full flight, clearly indicating consciousness of\nguilt. They argue that, given the evolving nature of the situation, we must not limit the\nquestion to what Officers Brandt and Bodisco knew at the outset of the chase, but must\nconsider all the circumstances known to them prior to Cornell’s surrender. We agree, but\nthe problem for appellants is that what happened on the High Path was provoked. The\njury’s finding that Officers Brandt and Farrell reasonably perceived Cornell to be running\naway from them at that point does not negate the obvious: Foolishly or not, Cornell ran\naway at the point of a gun and a threat of “I will shoot you.” Other than this panicked\nreaction—which Officer Brandt brought about—there was no greater cause to detain\nCornell on the High Path than there was on Hippie Hill.12\n       Granted, the better and certainly the safer course for Cornell was to surrender on\nthe High Path, but in order for his defiance to constitute a violation of Penal Code section\n148, Officers Brandt and Farrell still had to be acting in the lawful performance of their\nduties, which places the focus back on what happened at the beginning of the chase.\nBecause Officers Brandt and Bodisco did not have reasonable suspicion to detain in the\nfirst place, the trial court properly concluded that none of the appellant officers acted in\nthe lawful course of his duties at later points in time. Thus, when Cornell darted away on\nthe High Path, it made no difference whether he took off out of fright, still unaware he\nwas being chased by police officers (as he claims), or out of a desire not to be caught,\ndespite having looked straight at two uniformed officers, in defiance of their command to\n\n       12\n           We might have been inclined to conclude otherwise if the jury had found that\nCornell, in reaction to a command from Officer Brandt to stop, had committed some\ncrime posing a threat to any of the appellant officers or to the public. Under Brown v.\nIllinois (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, that would have attenuated the taint of the unjustified\nattempt to detain him. But merely fleeing on foot from a show of force does not bring\nBrown doctrine into play. (United States v. Brodie (D.C.

Officer Brandt chased down and trained a weapon on a\nrunning man about whom he knew virtually nothing, except that this was someone who\nhad the temerity to try to elude capture. Without something objectively tying him to\ncriminal activity, we conclude that none of the appellant officers had a legal basis to\ndetain—much less probable cause to arrest—on Hippie Hill, on the High Path, or in\nAIDS Memorial Grove.\n         B.    Incomplete Phase I Special Verdict\n         In addition to claiming there was reasonable suspicion to detain and thus probable\ncause to arrest, appellants challenge the Phase I verdict on procedural grounds. After\nmany days of deliberation in Phase I, and after the jury had sent multiple messages to the\ncourt asking about specific questions posed on the Phase I Verdict Form, and after\nrepeatedly reporting an inability to reach a verdict on a number of those questions, the\njury finally managed to reach a verdict on all but one question, Question No. 8.\nAppellants argue that this question—which asked the jury to find whether Officers\nBrandt and Bodisco reasonably believed Cornell was fleeing from them when he began\nrunning on Hippie Hill—was so material to the issue of reasonable suspicion that it was\nreversible error to accept the Phase I verdict without an answer to it. On that basis, they\ncontend it was an abuse of discretion to deny their motion for a mistrial. We cannot\nagree.\n         Even assuming the acceptance of an incomplete Phase I Verdict Form was error,\nwe do not see the factual issue presented by Question No. 8 as so material to the total mix\nof facts that it would have changed the outcome on the issue of reasonable suspicion had\nit been decided in favor of appellants. Cornell would have been entitled to walk away\nhad the officers approached him on Hippie Hill, as we note above. Our analysis of the\ncircumstances when he left Hippie Hill assumes Officers Brandt and Bodisco did\nperceive he ran from them, as they testified, and as Question No. 8 asked the jury to find,\nbut even granting that assumption we do not think the totality of what they knew at that\nstage points to anything more than a hunch that he could have had some connection to\ncriminal activity on Hippie Hill. We thus conclude the court did not abuse its discretion\nby denying appellants’ motion for a mistrial. (See Blumenthal v. Superior Court (2006)\n\n                                             19\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Statutory Immunity Under Penal Code Section 847, Subdivision (b)\n       Next, appellants argue we should reverse because the trial court never\n“specifically addressed” whether the appellant officers are statutorily immune for the\nfalse arrest of Cornell. Penal Code section 847, subdivision (b) provides that “[t]here\nshall be no civil liability on the part of, and no cause of action shall arise against, any\npeace officer . . . , acting within the scope of his or her authority, for false arrest or false\nimprisonment arising out of any arrest” under specified circumstances, and one of those\ncircumstances, set forth in subdivision (b)(1), is that “[t]he arrest was lawful, or the peace\nofficer, at the time of the arrest, had reasonable cause to believe the arrest was lawful.”\n       We see no error here either. California courts speak of “reasonable cause” and\n“probable cause” interchangeably (Pool v.

The statutory scheme of\nwhich Penal Code section 847 is part,13 much of which was enacted in 1872 as part of the\nField Code, uses both terms without differentiation, and the few cases that apply\nsubdivision (b)(1)—which first appeared in language added by amendment in 195714—\ngive no separate consideration to its reach after completing their analyses of probable\ncause.

It is based on a reading\nof the language of Penal Code 847, subdivision (b), that was first advocated in 1963 by\nthe eminent scholar of governmental immunity in California, Professor Arvo Van\nAlstyne. Focusing his attention on the fact that the statute, by its literal terms, affords\nimmunity for false arrest if “the arrest was lawful, or the peace officer, at the time of the\narrest, had reasonable cause to believe the arrest was lawful” (italics added), Professor\nVan Alstyne argued that the disjunctive phrase “reasonable cause to believe” would be\nsurplusage if it did not defeat liability for unlawful arrests as well as lawful ones. (See\n“A Study Relating to Sovereign Immunity” (Jan. 1963) 5 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep.\n(1963), at pp. 407–408 (1963 Van Alstyne Study).) To trigger the protection of the\nstatute, he argued, an officer should only be required to show he in fact believed the\narrest was justified. (Id. at p. 408.)15\n       Giving a modern twist to what was, in effect, a call for immunity by Professor Van\nAlstyne based on a standard of subjective good faith, appellants suggest we read into\nPenal Code section 847, subdivision (b), the federal standard for qualified immunity that\nhas evolved in the last three decades, which is based on an objective appraisal of whether\nan officer facing civil suit violated “clearly established” law, and is not simply a test of\nsubjective good faith. (See Estate of Lopez v.

[S]ection 52.1” (153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1246), but\nthe appellate panel in that case took care to mention it was not addressing “whether a\nstatutory immunity might apply.” (Ibid.) We understand appellants to be taking up the\nissue left open there, using Penal Code section 847 as the statutory basis for their\nargument, while, in effect, bringing in federal qualified immunity, so to speak, “through\nthe back door.” Even if we were receptive to the idea of introducing federal qualified\nimmunity into California law in this fashion despite the holding in Venegas II—we are\nnot, since we view that opinion as soundly reasoned—we reject the premise that Penal\nCode section 847, subdivision (b)(1) adds an extra layer of protection beyond what is\nalready afforded by the doctrine of probable cause. Because nothing in the statutory\nscheme for official immunity in California alters the rule that “[u]nder California law, a\npolice officer is not granted governmental immunity for false arrest and imprisonment”\n(O’Toole, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 510), we see no basis to borrow the federal rule of\nqualified immunity absent specific legislative authorization.\n       We do not agree that Penal Code section 847 provides that authorization.\nSubdivision (b)(1) of Penal Code section 847 is coextensive with the doctrine of probable\ncause (Hamilton, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 846), but goes no further.

The\nlegislative history makes clear why section 847, subdivision (b) uses the disjunctive in\nreferring to a “lawful” arrest “or” an arrest made on “reasonable cause to believe the\narrest was lawful.” The alternative “reasonable cause” scenario tracks a secondary\nholding of the Dragna case, which addresses liability for unreasonably prolonged jail\ndetention prior to arraignment. (See Dragna, supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 473 [“where the\narrest is lawful, subsequent unreasonable delay in taking the person before a magistrate\nwill not affect the legality of the arrest, although it will subject the offending person to\nliability for so much of the imprisonment as occurs after the period of necessary or\nreasonable delay.”].) Thus, the Senate Interim Judiciary Committee Report, citing\nDragna, explains that, “present legal thinking [citation] indicates that while an arrest,\nbased upon reasonable cause, is lawful, . . . a subsequent detention could be unlawful.\nSuch would be the case if after arrest, but before the arraignment, the arresting officer\n\n\n       18\n          In response to the California Supreme Court’s landmark decision recognizing\nthe exclusionary rule in People v.

Objections to Assembly Bill\nNo. 1857 focused primarily on the fact that, for the first time, broad legislative\nrecognition was being given to the power of warrantless detention in circumstances short\nof arrest.

It is simply descriptive of the two-part holding in\nDragna that the Legislature recognized as foundational. Shorn of its textual premise, the\npolicy rationale for Professor Van Alstyne’s reading of the statutory language—that\npeace officers should have protection from civil liability for arrests made upon reasonable\nmistake—is already fundamental to the modern concept of probable cause and its close\ncousin reasonable suspicion. Without clear and definite legislative authorization, we are\nnot inclined to announce that, after all these years, we have discovered in section 847,\nsubdivision (b) an additional layer of protection from civil liability beyond what already\nexists through the doctrine of probable cause, or to use section 847 as the statutory basis\nfor importing federal qualified immunity into California law.19\n       D.

In a broad\nconceptual sense, that is true, since both Section 52.1 and the MCRA are supplements to\nSection 1983, providing state law civil remedies for violation of constitutional and\nstatutory rights protected by federal as well as state law. But the most similar federal\ncivil rights statute to Section 52.1, textually and structurally—similar enough to suggest\nthat it, not Section 1983, was the original template our Legislature drew from—is Section\n241. (See Final Report of the Van de Kamp Commission, Chptr. 3, “Proposed California\nCivil Rights Act,” at p. 23 & p. 24, fn. 4 [“The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act is\npatterned after federal civil rights statutes that protect rights guaranteed by federal laws\nand the Constitution,” citing to Section 241, with no mention of Section 1983].)22\n\n\n       22\n          While the citation to Section 241 in the Final Report of the Van de Kamp\nCommission provides fairly clear evidence of the genesis of Section 52.1, the language of\nSection 52.1 is also traceable to Section 241 by direct comparison. Section 52.1 adopts\nthe signature structure of Section 241, which prohibits interference with the “free\nexercise” or “enjoyment” of a broadly-defined class of “secured” civil rights. And\nSection 52.1, like Section 241, targets the use of fear-inducing conduct to carry out the\ninterference. Where Section 52.1 prohibits “interfere[nce]” by “threats, intimidation or\ncoercion,” Section 241 prohibits attempts to “injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate”\nsomeone in the exercise of protected rights. In addition, the modern adaptation of\nSection 241’s rights-interference structure in other federal legislation can be seen in the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965, which uses language nearly identical to that of Section 52.1.\n(See 52 U.S.C. § 10101(b) [“No person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise,\nshall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other\n\n\n                                              28\n\f              2.     Appellants’ Contentions\n       Appellants argue we should reverse the finding for Cornell on his Section 52.1\nclaim along with the accompanying award of statutory attorney’s fees because there was\ninsufficient evidence to submit that claim to the jury. This attack on the Section 52.1\nverdict here is three-pronged. First, appellants point out that since the jury rejected\nCornell’s assault claim, it necessarily rejected his claim of excessive force. Relying on\nthe requirement that a Section 52.1 claim must rest on evidence of “threat[], intimidation\nor coercion,” they contend it was error for the trial court to submit this statutory claim to\nthe jury. We reject the premise of this argument. Nothing in the Phase I Special Verdict\nForm required the jury to make any express finding on the issue of unreasonable force.\nThe Phase I jury instruction on assault defined unreasonable force using the Fourth\nAmendment multifactor articulation of excessive force in Graham v. Connor (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Graham), and listed the use of unreasonable force, so defined, as one of six\nelements of assault.23 Because the use of unreasonable force was only one element of the\n\n\nperson for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote\nas he may choose . . .”].)\n\n        By contrast, the text of Section 1983 and its criminal counterpart Section 242—\nstatutes which are limited to state action, and focus on “depriv[ation]’” of rights instead\nof interference with rights—bears almost no similarity to Section 52.1, other than\ncommon use of the phrase “under color of law.” Section 1985(3), the civil counterpart to\nSection 241, also differs significantly from Section 241. Section 1985(3) is limited to\nprivate acts of “conspir[ing] or go[ing] in disguise on the highway or on the premises of\nanother, for the purpose of depriving . . . any person or class of persons of the equal\nprotection of the laws . . . .” Based on its limiting language, a requisite element of any\nSection 1985(3) claim is that it must be based on “some racial [or] . . . otherwise class-\nbased, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators’ action” (Griffin v.\nBreckenridge (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108362\"><a href=\"/opinion/108362/griffin-v-breckenridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102), which is the very limitation our Supreme Court\nheld in Venegas does not apply to Section 52.1. (Venegas, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 843.)\nThis compare-and-contrast exercise thus leaves Section 241 as the most closely\ncomparable statute to Section 52.1 among its historical antecedents in federal civil rights\nlaw.\n       23\n         The court’s assault instruction, adapted from Judicial Council Of California\nCivil Jury Instructions (CACI) Nos. 1301 (Assault—Essential Elements) and 1305\n\n\n                                             29\n\fassault instruction, the jury may have rejected the assault claim while still believing there\nwas unreasonable force here.\n       Cornell’s theory was that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin committed an assault\nby pointing a gun at him, putting him in fear of being shot. In support of this theory, he\npresented evidence that the gun-pointing by both officers in a low-threat level situation\nviolated the San Francisco Police Department’s policy on the use of deadly force and\nofficer training standards for handling weapons. Indulging all inferences in favor of\nreconciling the Phase I and Phase II verdicts, as we must, a rational jury in Phase II could\nhave concluded that, under the circumstances, the threatened use of deadly force was\nunreasonable (see Robinson v. Solano County (9th Cir. 2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776378\"><a href=\"/opinion/776378/james-f-robinson-v-solano-county-brian-cauwells-solano-county-sheriffs/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1013\n[officers’ conduct in pointing gun at detainee at close range presents triable issue of fact\non excessive force claim]), while at the same time concluding in Phase I that the gun-\npointing—standing alone—was not a substantial factor in the “harm” caused to Cornell.\nOn this reading of the jury’s verdicts, what accounts for the Phase II findings against\nOfficer Brandt and Sergeant Gin on the Section 52.1 claim is that the gun-pointing\ncombined with the unlawful arrest, the baseless Penal Code section 148 citation, and all\nof the other mistreatment of Cornell following the arrest, caused the harm.\n       The explanation for the finding against Cornell on the assault claim, but in his\nfavor on the Section 52.1 claim, may also be one of timing. In resolving the assault\nclaim, the jury may have decided in Phase I that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin were\nprivileged to use force under Penal Code section 835a [“[a]ny peace officer who has\nreasonable cause to believe . . . [an arrestee] has committed a public offense may use\nreasonable force to effect the arrest]”, but then, following the court’s determination of no\n\n\n\n\n(Battery by Police Officer), advised the jury that, to prove assault, Cornell must establish\nthat (1) a defendant threatened to touch him in a harmful or offensive manner, (2) it\nreasonably appeared to him the threat was about to be carried out, (3) the threat\nconstituted unreasonable force, (4) he did not consent to the touching, (5) he was harmed,\nand (6) the threatening conduct was a substantial factor in causing his harm.\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\fprobable cause, concluded in Phase II that there was no such privilege.24 For both of\nthese reasons, we do not accept the premise that the jury’s adverse assault verdict in\nPhase I destroyed the basis for Section 52.1 liability in Phase II.

(See Allen v. City of\nSacramento (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We\nhave more here than a simple false arrest. Cornell’s arrest was carried out with threats of\nviolence and was just the start of a series of events suggesting an intent to demean him\nand set him up for termination, without regard to whether the suspicions that led to the\narrest were well-founded. After an interrogation by Officer Brandt at Park Station during\nwhich Brandt accused Cornell of lying, over his protestations he had done nothing wrong,\nCornell was finally released, nearly six hours following his arrest. By that time, a team\nof officers had undertaken a fruitless hunt for incriminating evidence in Golden Gate\nPark; a secret recording device was placed next to Cornell in an ambulance “because [he]\nmight say something stupid,” which yielded nothing; and a hospital drug test turned up\nnegative.\n       Then, upon Cornell’s release, he was cited for the misdemeanor offense of\nviolating Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a).

Appellants contend the omission of a Penal Code section 835a instruction in\nPhase II was error, but they made no specific request for such an instruction in Phase II,\nand as a result, they have waived the issue. Even had they made one, however, they\nwould not have been entitled to another Penal Code section 835a instruction, since, as\nnoted, by that point—given the trial court’s no probable cause determination at the\nconclusion of Phase I—the requirement in Penal Code section 835a that Officer Brandt\nand Sergeant Gin acted with “reasonable cause to believe the person to be arrested has\ncommitted a public offense” was lacking.\n\n                                             31\n\finternal affairs unit of the San Francisco Police Department, and without further\ninvestigation by internal affairs, the citation became the basis of a misconduct charge,\nresulting in Cornell’s firing.

We are told that\nShoyoye “requires a showing of coercion independent from the coercion inherent in the\nwrongful detention itself” (Shoyoye, at p. 959), and that, because none of the\nmistreatment of Cornell is meaningfully segregable or discrete from his arrest, appellants\nstill must prevail as a matter of law on the Section 52.1 claim. We think appellants read\ntoo much into Shoyoye. There, the plaintiff was arrested on outstanding bench warrants\nfor two minor offenses, one based on a theft by someone posing as him, and upon a\nsubsequent court appearance he was ordered released.

It is not evident to us that he did. Because the reasonableness of a\nseizure for Fourth Amendment purposes is judged at the time of an arrest or detention,\nonce Shoyoye conceded there was probable cause for his arrest he appears to have\nconceded away at the same time any legal basis for a claim of unreasonable seizure\nbeyond that point.

Although that would have been enough\nto resolve the Section 52.1 claim had it been asserted on a standalone basis without an\naccompanying tort claim, the court went on in a separate section to explain that violation\nof Section 52.1 requires a showing of coercion “independent from the coercion inherent\nin the wrongful detention itself.” (Shoyoye, at pp. 959, 960–961.) While acknowledging\nthat plaintiff Shoyoye’s imprisonment may have been “traumatic” and “frightening,” and\nthat “County employees certainly were rude to him at times,” the court concluded that\n“they did not threaten or intimidate [him] for voicing his opinion that he should be\nreleased. They coerced him to remain incarcerated, but they did not for example coerce\nhim to stop inquiring about his release, threaten him for doing so, or punish him in any\nway. No one ignored plaintiff deliberately, knowing that he should in fact be released, let\nalone purposefully threaten or intimidate him. At worst they were rude and indifferent to\nhis inquiries. But jail officials do not have a duty to be polite.” (Id. at p. 961.) We see\nthe case before us differently, for reasons we explain below.\n              3.      Shoyoye is a Jail Overdetention Case that Began with A Lawful\n                      Arrest\n\n       To begin with, the record here supports a finding of more than negligence or lack\nof courtesy. More importantly, we view the second step of the court’s Section 52.1\nanalysis in Shoyoye—its independent from inherent coercion test—as inapplicable where,\nas here, a Bane Act plaintiff pleads and proves a constitutionally unlawful arrest. We\n\n\narresting officer is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment]), Shoyoye made no\nsuch claim.\n\n\n                                              34\n\freach this conclusion upon a close reading of Shoyoye, paying careful attention to its facts\nand to the claims at issue there. The situation leading to plaintiff Shoyoye’s mistaken\nincarceration started with his arrest, and originally he alleged a constitutionally\nunreasonable seizure, but as the case proceeded there was never any dispute that the\narrest was lawful. In fact, he conceded there was probable cause to arrest him. (Shoyoye,\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 951, fn. 2.) Thus, the nub of his Section 52.1 theory was not\nunlawful arrest, but rather his continued incarceration despite a judicial release order—in\nshort, jail overdetention.\n       At trial, Shoyoye presented evidence that, while in jail, he inquired repeatedly\nabout why he had not been released, but was ignored by his jailers until, through a friend,\nhe managed to have a member of the Legislature look into his circumstances, which\nultimately triggered his release. (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at pp. 951–953.) On\nthat record, the appellate court affirmed the false imprisonment verdict (id. at p. 963),\nconsistent with well-established California law that a jailer who “knew or should have\nknown of the illegality of the imprisonment” will be liable in tort for false imprisonment.\n(Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1177028\"><a href=\"/opinion/1177028/sullivan-v-county-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717–718 (Sullivan).)28 While\nthe act of keeping Shoyoye in jail despite his pointed inquiries was sufficient to support\n\n       28\n          The test for false imprisonment in jail overdetention cases established in\nSullivan “requires either that the sheriff have actual knowledge that the imprisonment of\nthe plaintiff is unlawful or alternatively that he have some notice sufficient to put him, as\na reasonable man, under a duty to investigate the validity of the incarceration.” (Sullivan,\nsupra, 12 Cal.3d at p. 719.) Shoyoye’s brief discussion of false imprisonment recites its\nrequisite elements (“ ‘(1) the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person,\n(2) without lawful privilege, and (3) for an appreciable period of time, however brief”\n(Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 958, quoting Easton v. Sutter Coast Hospital\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496)), and then concludes without elaboration that “[t]he\nevidence presented at trial was clearly sufficient to establish those elements.” (Shoyoye,\nat p. 958.) The court never mentions Sullivan and appears to assume there is something it\ncalls “a tort claim for negligent false imprisonment” (ibid.)—the Sullivan test is actually\nmore akin to one requiring at least gross negligence—but the result it reaches, affirming\nthe false imprisonment verdict on facts showing that plaintiff Shoyoye repeatedly brought\nhis mistaken incarceration to the attention of multiple jail employees, tracks Sullivan’s\nreasoning.\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\ftort liability, the court saw his jailers’ negligent failure to discover they were holding the\nwrong man—a mistake attributable, at bottom, to computer error—as insufficient to\nsupport Section 52.1 liability. The difference in the court’s treatment of these two claims\nis key, for any consideration of the breadth of Shoyoye’s Bane Act holding must begin\nwith the recognition that maintaining a meaningful distinction between tort and statutory\nliability was fundamental to its reading of Section 52.1.\n       When the court announces that Section 52.1 requires “coercion independent from\nthe coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself” (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 959), its focus is on whether the requisite level of scienter for Section 52.1 liability\nhad been met in a setting where the plaintiff proved negligence, at most. To support\nSection 52.1 liability in that context, the court observes, there must be “an additional\nshowing of ill will or blameworthy conduct.” (Id. at p. 958, italics added.) It found no\nevidence that while in jail “any conduct directed at [Shoyoye] was for the purpose of\ninterfering with his constitutional rights.” (Id. at p. 961, italics added.) “[Jail] employees\ncould reasonably rely on the information in the computer system, based on the reasonable\nassumption that the quality control check would catch errors.” (Ibid.) All of Shoyoye’s\ntreatment while in jail, the court concludes, was “reasonable and incident to maintaining\na jail,” and even if his jailers did something to him that might be characterized as\n“intimidation” or “coercion,” none of it was “carried out in order to effect a knowing\ninterference with [his] constitutional rights.” (Ibid., italics added.)\n       Shoyoye uses a variety of terms to describe the scienter it has in mind (see 203\nCal.App.4th at p. 958 [“intentional and callous”]; id. at p. 959 [“deliberate or spiteful”];\nid. at p. 961 [“knowing and blameworthy”]), but its analysis sheds little light on how the\nrequired level of scienter should be evaluated in unlawful arrest cases. Bender suggests\nan answer, holding that, on the facts presented there—the plaintiff was arrested without\nprobable cause, handcuffed, and then gratuitously beaten and pepper-sprayed while\noffering no resistance—constitutionally excessive force met the required standard. But in\nthe end Bender is just as opaque as Shoyoye. Ultimately, the court couches its holding in\nthe same analytical framework as Shoyoye (Bender, at p. 981 [“[w]here, as here, an arrest\nis unlawful and excessive force is applied in making the arrest, there has been coercion\n\n                                              36\n\f‘independent from the coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself,’ ”] original\nitalics), thus implicitly accepting the applicability of Shoyoye’s “independ[ence] from\ninherent coercion” test in unlawful arrest cases.\n       We agree that the use of excessive force can be enough to satisfy the “threat,\nintimidation or coercion” element of Section 52.1, but we do not accept the premise that\nShoyoye applies in unlawful arrest cases. Because, read closely, Shoyoye’s discussion of\ncoercion “independent from the coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself” was\naimed at separating tort liability from statutory liability in the specific context of a jail\noverdetention following a lawful arrest—on a record where no legally viable claim of any\nconstitutional violation was pleaded or proved—we view its “independ[ence] from\ninherent coercion” test as simply inapplicable. The case before us is not a jail\noverdetention case. A constitutionally unlawful arrest was proved, and, as noted above,\nwe have more than a simple false arrest. Under these circumstances, the better approach,\nin our view, is to focus directly on the level of scienter required to support a Section 52.1\nclaim, without the trappings of Shoyoye’s frame of analysis.\n              4.      Where an Unlawful Arrest is Properly Pleaded and Proved, the\n                      “Threat, Intimidation or Coercion” Element of Section 52.1 Requires\n                      a Specific Intent to Violate Protected Rights\n\n       We acknowledge that some courts have read Shoyoye as having announced\n“independen[ce] from inherent coercion” as a requisite element of all Section 52.1 claims\nalleging search-and-seizure violations, but we think those courts misread the statute as\nwell as the import of Venegas.29 By its plain terms, Section 52.1 proscribes any\n\n       29\n          (See, e.g., Lyall v.

It strikes us as an\noverstatment to say there are “numerous California decisions” for this proposition or that\nour case law is “clear“ on the point. Allen, a pleading case, and the sole published\nCalifornia appellate opinion to consider Shoyoye in any depth, ultimately holds only that\n“conclusory allegations of ‘forcible’ and ‘coercive’ interference with plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                               37\n\f“interference with” or attempted “interference with” protected rights carried out “by\nthreat, intimidation or coercion.” Nothing in the text of the statute requires that the\noffending “threat, intimidation or coercion” be “independent” from the constitutional\nviolation alleged. Indeed, if the words of the statute are given their plain meaning, the\nrequired “threat, intimidation or coercion” can never be “independent” from the\nunderlying violation or attempted violation of rights, because this element of fear-\ninducing conduct is simply the means of accomplishing the offending deed (the\n“interference” or “attempted interference”). That is clear from the structure of the statute,\nwhich reads, “If a person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interferes\nby threat, intimidation, or coercion,” a private action for redress is available. (§ 52.1,\nsubd. (a), italics added.)\n       In Venegas—which rejected a construction of Section 52.1 limiting its\napplicability to “threat[s], intimidation or coercion” against minorities and other\nstatutorily protected groups—the Supreme Court declined to place “added restrictions on\nthe scope of section 52.1” beyond its plain language, concluding that that “would appear\nto be more a legislative concern than a judicial one.” (Venegas, supra, 32 Cal.4th at\np. 843.) The same may be said here. Properly read, the statutory phrase “threat,\nintimidation or coercion” serves as an aggravator justifying the conclusion that the\nunderlying violation of rights is sufficiently egregious to warrant enhanced statutory\nremedies, beyond tort relief. We see no reason that, in addition, the required “threat,\nintimidation or coercion,” whatever form it may take, must also be transactionally\n“independent” from a properly pleaded—and proved—unlawful arrest.\n       The phrase “under color of law” indicates, without doubt, that the Legislature\nintended to include law enforcement officers within the scope of Section 52.1 if the\nrequisites of the statute are otherwise met. (See ante, fn. 17.) Much of what law\n\n\n\nconstitutional rights are inadequate to state a cause of action for a violation of section\n52.1.” (Allen, at p. 69.) Quezada refers briefly to Shoyoye’s independent from inherent\ncoercion test in a background summary of Section 52.1 law, but never applies it, relying\ninstead on the fact that no coercion at all was present in the case. (Quezada, at p. 1008).\n\n\n                                              38\n\fenforcement officers do in settings that test the limits of their authority is “inherently\ncoercive.” Given that reality, it seems to us inconsistent with an intent to bring law\nenforcement within the scope of the statute—which is what the phrase “under color of\nlaw” does—to say, categorically, even where an unlawful arrest is properly pleaded and\nproved, that “where[ever] coercion is inherent in the constitutional violation alleged, . . .\nthe statutory requirement of ‘threats, intimidation, or coercion’ is not met.” (Shoyoye,\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 959.) When applied to both lawful and unlawful conduct,\nsuch a reading of Section 52.1, in effect, creates a judicially-fashioned immunity; and not\nmerely a qualified immunity, but an absolute one covering a broad category of activity so\nlong as it may be described as “inherently coercive.”\n       In federal court, where Section 52.1 claims are frequently brought along with\nSection 1983 claims under federal pendent jurisdiction, “[t]he Bane Act’s requirement\nthat interference with rights must be accomplished by threats[,] intimidation or coercion\n‘has been the source of much debate and confusion.’ ” (McKibben v.

Paul J. Watford, Screws v. United States and the Birth of Federal Civil\nRights Enforcement (2014) 98 Marq. L.Rev. 465, 481–484.\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\ftext and structure of Section 52.1 appears to descend from Section 241. It seems to us\nthat, when our Legislature enacted hate crime legislation in 1987, it chose not to adhere\nstrictly to the federal scheme by adopting a civil enforcement statute on the model of\nSection 1983, covering “deprivations” of rights and limiting the statute to public officials\nor other conduct evincing state action. Instead, it used as a model Section 241—a\ncriminal conspiracy statute—giving the statute enough breadth to reach a wide range of\n“interference” with “secured rights” by means of fear-inducing conduct, whether\nundertaken by private actors or public officials. In essence, the Legislature created a\nhybrid of the historic federal civil rights enforcement scheme, using Section 241 as a\nunitary model for criminal as well as civil enforcement. The burden of proof is\nfundamentally different in these two arenas, of course, but other than that we see no\nreason why the applicable mens rea element ought to differ.32\n\n\n       32\n          Our reading of Section 52.1 is consistent with the view taken by “the majority of\nfederal district courts in California[, which] have held [in Bane Act cases] that ‘[w]here\nFourth Amendment unreasonable seizure or excessive force claims are raised and\nintentional conduct is at issue, there is no need for a plaintiff to allege a showing of\ncoercion independent from the coercion inherent in the seizure or use of force.’ ”\n(Simmons, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 1126, quoting Dillman v.

Application of the Specific Intent Standard\n       The application of the Screws specific intent standard here is straightforward. As\nexplained in Lashley, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which was cited with approval by our\nSupreme Court in In re M.S., supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 713, this test “ ‘essentially sets forth\ntwo requirements for a finding of “specific intent” . . . . The first is a purely legal\ndetermination. Is the . . . right at issue clearly delineated and plainly applicable under the\ncircumstances of the case?[33] If the trial judge concludes that it is, then the jury must\nmake the second, factual, determination. Did the defendant commit the act in question\nwith the particular purpose of depriving the citizen victim of his enjoyment of the\ninterests protected by that . . . right? If both requirements are met, even if the defendant\ndid not in fact recognize the [unlawfulness] of his act, he will be adjudged as a matter of\nlaw to have acted [with the requisite specific intent]—i.e., “in reckless disregard of\nconstitutional [or statutory] prohibitions or guarantees.” ’ ” (Lashley, at pp. 948–949.)\n       Applying the first step of this test here, the “right at issue” is Cornell’s federal and\nstate constitutional right to be free from arrest without probable cause. Legally, there is\nnothing vague or novel about that claim under the circumstances of this case. Viewing\nthe Phase I evidence in the light most favorable to Cornell, the protected right he asserts\nwas “clearly delineated and plainly applicable.” Thus, we reject appellants’ contention\n\n\nbisexual or transgender inmates to accept segregated housing with fewer privileges than\nother inmates]; M.H. v.

These cases stand in stark contrast\nto others that apply the independent from inherent coercion test—in our view\nincorrectly—outside the confines of jail overdetention, taking that test to the limit of its\nlogic. (See, e.g., Bordegaray v. County of Santa Barbara (C.D. Cal. 2016) 2016 U.S.\nDist. Lexis 172269, at pp.*39–41 [evidence of constitutionally excessive force in police\nshooting case held insufficient to support Section 52.1 claim because, other than being\nshot, the plaintiff failed to show any “threat, intimidation or coercion”].)\n       33\n          By way of illustration, we observe that the Section 52.1 claim in Shoyoye likely\nwould have not have met this first step of the specific intent standard because the plaintiff\nin that case appears to have alleged no viable theory of constitutional violation. (See fn.\n27, ante.) The same is true of a recent case applying Shoyoye, Julian v. Mission\nCommunity Hospital (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 360, 395 (“other than the actions necessary\nto detain [plaintiff], which the police had probable cause to take, [plaintiff] alleged\nwithout explanation that the police defendants ‘engaged in tactics to scare’ her”).\n\n                                              42\n\fthat, as a matter of law, the Section 52.1 claim never should have been submitted to the\njury. The second requirement, a question of fact, is whether appellants acted with the\n“particular purpose” of depriving Cornell of his right to be free from arrest without\nprobable cause. Subjective “spite” was relevant here, along with all of the objective\ncircumstances surrounding the unlawful arrest, both before it and after it. But whether\nthe appellant officers understood they were acting unlawfully was not a requirement.\nReckless disregard of the “right at issue” is all that was necessary.\n       In Phase II, the jury was instructed that “Plaintiff Cornell claims . . . Defendants\nBrandt and Gin intentionally interfered with or attempted to interfere with his civil rights\nby threats, intimidation, or coercion.” According to the jury instructions, to return a\nverdict for Cornell on the Section 52.1 claim, the jury was required to find that he proved\n“all of the following: [¶] 1. That the Defendant made threats of violence against Plaintiff\ncausing Plaintiff to reasonably believe that if he exercised his right to be free from\nunlawful detention or unlawful arrest, Defendant would commit violence against him and\nthat Defendant had the apparent ability to carry out the threats; [¶] 2. That Plaintiff was\nharmed; and [¶] 3. That the Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing\nPlaintiff’s harm.” (CACI No. 3066.) These instructions properly focused the jury on\nintentional violation of Cornell’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure.\n       Although Cornell’s primary theory at trial was that the gun-pointing made his false\narrest particularly egregious (hence the focus on “threats of violence” in the instructions),\nit must be borne in mind that he also submitted proof that the harm he suffered from the\narrest—his job loss, in particular—was inflicted out of spite. Considering the evidence\nsurrounding Cornell’s arrest in its full context, it seems to us a rational jury could have\nconcluded not only that Officer Brandt and Sergeant Gin were unconcerned from the\noutset with whether there was legal cause to detain or arrest him, but that when they\nrealized their error, they doubled-down on it, knowing they were inflicting grievous\ninjury on their prisoner. On this reading of the evidence, these two officers had every\nopportunity to exercise restraint as it became clearer and clearer that their initial\nsuspicions of Cornell were unfounded, but rather than let the matter go when they finally\nreleased him, they retaliated against him as a way of undermining his ability to claim to\n\n                                              43\n\fsuperiors he was arrested without probable cause. This apparent effort to obstruct\nCornell’s ability to assert his right to freedom from unreasonable seizure violated Section\n52.1 just as surely as his actual arrest did, while compounding the harm. On this record,\nwe have no trouble concluding the specific intent standard was met.34\n                                 III.   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment and the award of attorney’s fees and costs are affirmed. Respondent\nshall recover costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n           Appellants present no separate argument in support of their appeal of the award\nof statutory attorney’s fees and costs, apart from the contention that the Section 52.1\nverdict should be reversed. Having concluded there is no infirmity in the Section 52.1\nverdict, we will sustain the accompanying award of fees and costs. Appellants also\nsuggest in their reply brief that they seek to appeal from the judgment on the negligence\nand interference with economic advantage claims, but there, too, they present no separate\nargument and thus they have waived any defect in the judgment insofar as it rests on\nliability for those claims.\n\n                                            44\n\f                                             _________________________\n                                             Streeter, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRuvolo, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nRivera, J.\n\n\n\n\nA141016, A142147/Cornell v.
