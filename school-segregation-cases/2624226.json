G.B. has been\n\nidentified as eligible for special education and related services pursuant to the Individuals with\n\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act (“IDEA”),1 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. This suit invokes\n\nthe IDEA’s “stay-put” provision and seeks to force the District to fund G.B.’s placement in a\n\nnon-public educational program while the challenge to G.B.’s December 8, 2014, Individualized\n\nEducation Program (“IEP”) is under review by an administrative hearing officer. Concurrently\n\nwith the Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) and a\n\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. During a telephonic conference call with the Court, the\n\nparties agreed to a briefing schedule for Plaintiffs’ TRO request. Minute Order (Jan. 8, 2015).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The IDEA was re-authorized and re-codified pursuant to the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act in 2004, Pub. L. No. 108–446, 118 Stat. 2647\n(2004). The short title of the re-authorized and amended provisions remains the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act. See Pub. L. No. 108–446, § 101; 118 Stat. at 2647; 20 U.S.C. § 1400\n(2006). Accordingly, the Court refers to the amended Act herein as the IDEA.\n\fPlaintiffs’ Motion for a TRO is now fully briefed.2 After considering the parties’ briefs, the\n\naccompanying exhibits, and the applicable authorities, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled\n\nto a “stay-put” injunction. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order is\n\nGRANTED. As the grounds for Plaintiffs’ request for a Preliminary Injunction are identical to\n\nthe grounds for Plaintiffs’ TRO request, the Court also GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. [3], during the pendency of the administrative challenge.\n\n                                      I.     BACKGROUND\n\n   A. Statutory Framework\n\n   The IDEA was enacted to “ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a\n\nfree appropriate public education [“FAPE”] that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,\n\nemployment, and independent living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). Once a child is identified as\n\ndisabled, the school district within which the child resides must convene a meeting of a multi-\n\ndisciplinary team to develop an individualized education program (“IEP”) for the student. See §\n\n1414. “The IEP is in brief a comprehensive statement of the educational needs of a handicapped\n\nchild and the specially designed instruction and related services to be employed to meet those\n\nneeds.” Leonard v. McKenzie, 869 F.2d 1558, 1560 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quoting Sch. Comm. of\n\nthe Town of Burlington v. Dept. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368 (1985)). As such, it represents the\n\n“modus operandi” of the IDEA. Id. The IEP must be formulated in accordance with the terms\n\nof the IDEA and “should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks\n\n\n\n       2\n         Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“Pls.’ TRO”), ECF No. [2];\nDefendant’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“Def.’s\nOpp’n”), ECF No. [7]; Plaintiffs’ Reply to Opposition to Motion for Temporary Restraining\nOrder (“Pls.’ Reply”), ECF No. [8].\n                                            2\n\fand advance from grade to grade.” Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 204 (1982). Once the IEP is developed, the school system must provide\n\nan appropriate educational placement that comports with the IEP. Alston v. District of\n\nColumbia, 439 F.Supp.2d 86, 90 (D.D.C. 2006). “If no suitable public school is available, the\n\nschool system must pay the costs of sending the child to an appropriate private school.” Reid ex\n\nrel. Reid v. District of Columbia, 401 F.3d 516, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citation and internal\n\nediting omitted).\n\n   If the parent of a child receiving services pursuant to the IDEA believes his or her child’s IEP\n\nor school placement is inadequate, the parent may file a “due process complaint.” E.g., 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(b)(7)(A). The IDEA further provides that\n\n       Except as provided in subsection (k)(4), during the pendency of any proceedings\n       conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency\n       and the parents otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current\n       educational placement of the child, or, if applying for initial admission to a public\n       school, shall, with the consent of the parents, be placed in the public school\n       program until all such proceedings have been completed.\n\nId. § 1415(j). Known as the “stay-put provision,” this section mandates that once a parent files a\n\ndue process complaint, “the child shall remain in the interim alternative educational setting\n\npending the decision of the hearing officer . . . unless the parent and the State or local\n\neducational agency agree otherwise.” Id. § 1415(k)(4); accord 34 C.F.R. § 300.518(a). The\n\npurpose of this provision is to prohibit “school officials from removing a child from the regular\n\npublic school classroom over the parents’ objection pending completion of the review\n\nproceedings.” Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 327 (1988).\n\n   B. Factual Background\n\n       The following facts are not disputed by the parties. G.B. is a thirteen year-old resident of\n\n                                                3\n\fthe District of Columbia who has been identified as a student with disabilities who is entitled to\n\nreceive special education and related services. Compl. ¶¶ 68, 69, 72. On October 16, 2013, the\n\nDistrict developed an IEP designed to provide G.B. with thirty-one hours of special education\n\ninstruction outside of the general education setting and one hour of behavioral support services\n\noutside of the general education setting for a total of thirty-two hours of services. Def.’s Opp’n\n\nat 1; Compl. ¶ 73. On December 13, 2013, the District reconvened the IEP team and developed\n\nanother IEP that again provided for thirty-one hours of special education instruction and one\n\nhour of behavioral support services outside of the general education setting. Def.’s Opp’n at 1;\n\nCompl. ¶ 74. Both IEPs “anticipated that [G.B.] would receive her services at a [District of\n\nColumbia Public Schools (“DCPS”)] school that had a fully separate special education setting,\n\nincluding separate entrance and lunchroom for special education students.” Def.’s Opp’n at 1.\n\n       The District identified the location for the provision of services as Hart Middle School\n\n(“Hart”) and G.B. was placed at Hart. Id. at 2; Compl. ¶ 76. However, Hart could only provide\n\nG.B. twenty-seven and a half hours of services per school week because it does not have a fully\n\nseparate special education setting. Id. In April 2014, G.B. was raped by two non-disabled\n\nstudents while transitioning to her bus at Hart. Compl. ¶ 78; Pls.’ TRO at 3, 8; Pls.’ Ex. 4\n\n(Children’s Hospital Medical Records). On December 8, 2014, the District reviewed and revised\n\nG.B.’s IEP to provide for twenty-seven and a half hours of specialized instruction and related\n\nservices. Def.’s Opp’n at 2; Compl. ¶¶ 97, 101. The District identified Cardozo High School as\n\nthe location for provision of G.B.’s IEP services. Def.’s Opp’n at 2; Compl. ¶ 102. “Due to the\n\nstructure of Cardozo, G.B. would normally have transitions and lunch with nondisabled peers.”\n\nDef.’s Opp’n at 2.\n\n       On December 31, 2014, Plaintiffs filed an administrative due process complaint before\n\n                                                4\n\fthe District’s Office of the State Superintendent of Education Office of Dispute Resolution\n\nchallenging, among other things, the December 8, 2014, IEP, and placement at Cardozo High\n\nSchool. Def.’s Opp’n at 2; Compl. ¶¶ 112-13. The administrative hearing officer’s decision is\n\ndue by March 16, 2015. Def.’s Opp’n at 1 (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.515). On January 8, 2015,\n\nPlaintiffs filed the present action invoking the IDEA’s “stay-put provision” and requested that\n\nthe District fund G.B.’s placement in a separate non-public special education school while their\n\ndue process complaint is adjudicated.\n\n                                         II.   DISCUSSION\n\n       Since the “stay-put provision” imposes an automatic statutory injunction, the traditional\n\nfour-part test for an injunction does not apply. D.K. ex rel. Klein v. District of Columbia, 962\n\nF.Supp.2d 227, 232 (D.D.C. 2013); Alston, 439 F.Supp.2d at 91-92. Instead, the Court must\n\nanswer two questions to determine whether Plaintiffs are entitled to a stay-put injunction: (1)\n\nwhat was G.B.’s “then-current educational placement” at the time the due process complaint was\n\nfiled?; and (2) has the District proposed a “fundamental change” in G.B.’s educational program?\n\nJohnson v. District of Columbia, 839 F.Supp.2d 176, 177 (D.D.C. 2012); see Laster v. District of\n\nColumbia, 394 F.Supp.2d 60, 64 (D.D.C. 2005) (citing Lunceford v. District of Columbia Bd. of\n\nEduc., 745 F.2d 1577, 1582 (D.C. Cir. 1984)) (A court may grant a stay put injunction if the\n\nschool system proposes “a fundamental change in, or elimination of, a basic element of the\n\n[then-current education placement].”).\n\n   A. G.B.’s “Then-Current Educational Placement”\n\n       Typically, “[t]he dispositive factor in deciding a child’s ‘current educational placement’\n\nshould be the [IEP] . . . actually functioning when the ‘stay put’ is invoked.” Johnson, 839\n\nF.Supp.2d at 177 (quoting Drinker ex rel. Drinker v. Colonial Sch. Dist., 78 F.3d 859, 867 (3d\n\n                                               5\n\fCir. 1996)). However, when a plaintiff has challenged the student’s educational placement in\n\nplace at the time the “stay-put provision” is invoked, courts traditionally treat the IEP in place\n\nprior to the challenged IEP as the controlling IEP for purposes of the “stay-put provision.” See\n\nLaster, 394 F.Supp.2d at 65 (finding the student’s then-current educational placement to be the\n\n2004-2005 IEP because the student’s guardian did not consent to the 2005-2006 IEP); Spilsbury\n\nv. District of Columbia, 307 F.Supp.2d 22, 25-26 (D.D.C. 2004) (holding that the IEP in place\n\nfor the students prior to the challenged IEP controlled what services the students were required to\n\nreceive during the pendency of the students’ challenge to the revised IEP).\n\n       Here, the parties do not dispute that G.B.’s December 13, 2013, IEP is the “then-current\n\neducational placement” for purposes of the “stay-put provision.” See Pls.’ TRO at 8; Def.’s\n\nOpp’n at 2. The December 2013 IEP provided for thirty-one hours per week of specialized\n\ninstruction “in an out of general education setting.” Pls.’ Ex. 3 (Dec. 2013 IEP), at 11. It also\n\nprovided for two hundred and forty minutes per month of Behavioral Support Services “in an out\n\nof general education setting.” Id. Behavioral Support Services were to “include counseling,\n\nbehavior management and consultation with teacher and parent to ensure that interventions are\n\nconsistently implemented in the school setting.” Id. at 9.3 As Defendant explains, “it was\n\nanticipated that the student would receive her services at a DCPS school that had a fully separate\n\nspecial education setting, including separate entrance and lunchroom for special education\n\n\n\n       3\n          The Court has placed G.B.’s IEPs under seal along with all of the exhibits Plaintiffs\nfiled in this case because they contain sensitive identifying information about G.B. and her\ndisability. The Court has directly quoted language from G.B.’s December 2013 IEP which is\nunder seal. However, the quoted language contains only a generic description of the services\nG.B. was to receive pursuant to the IEP and is akin to the information openly discussed by the\nparties in their briefing about the number of hours of services and types of services set forth in\nG.B.’s IEPs. Accordingly, the Court finds there is no reason to redact the language from G.B.’s\nDecember 2013 IEP that the Court has included in this Memorandum Opinion.\n                                                6\n\fstudents.” Def.’s Opp’n at 1. The December 2013 IEP did not require that G.B. receive the\n\nsupport of a dedicated aide. Pls.’ Ex. 3 (Dec. 2013 IEP), at 10.\n\n       Having identified G.B.’s “then-current educational placement,” the Court must now\n\nevaluate whether the District has proposed a fundamental change in G.B.’s educational\n\nplacement such that G.B. is entitled to be placed in her “then-current educational placement”\n\npending the resolution of Plaintiffs’ challenge to this proposed change.\n\n   B. Fundamental Change\n\n       At the outset, the Court notes that in response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a TRO, Defendant\n\nproposed several modifications to G.B.’s challenged December 2014 IEP in order “[t]o comply\n\nwith the maintenance of placement provision.” Def.’s Opp’n at 2-3. Specifically, Defendant\n\nproposed that G.B. “enjoy her lunch in a separate setting, which DCPS will provide, that will be\n\nseparate from the general education population and monitored by appropriate school personnel.”\n\nId. at 3.   Defendant also proposed that it “provide G.B. with a dedicated aide who will\n\naccompany her in her transitions between special education classes.” Id. Accordingly, the\n\nchange that Defendant is ultimately proposing in G.B.’s educational placement consists of a\n\nreduction from a total of thirty-two hours of specialized instruction and related services in a fully\n\nseparate special education setting to twenty-seven and a half hours of specialized instruction and\n\nrelated services with lunch in a setting separate from the general education population and\n\nmonitored by school personnel, and a dedicated aide to accompany G.B. in her transitions\n\nbetween special education classes.      Defendant argues that this newly proposed educational\n\nplacement “will not be a fundamental deviation from the December 13, 2013 IEP” as “the only\n\nde minimis difference [are] transitions among nondisabled peers with a dedicated aide.” Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n                                                 7\n\f       To be entitled to a “stay-put” injunction, Plaintiffs must identify a “change in the ‘general\n\neducational program in which a child . . . is enrolled, rather than mere variations in the program\n\nitself.’ ” Lunceford v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Educ., 745 F.2d 1577, 1582 (D.C. Cir. 1984)\n\n(quoting Concerned Parents v. New York City Board of Education, 629 F.2d 751 (2d Cir. 1980));\n\nsee also id. (“[A]ppellee must identify, at a minimum, a fundamental change in, or elimination of\n\na basic element of the education program in order for the change to qualify as a change in\n\neducational placement.”).    Based on this standard, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that\n\nDefendant’s proposed change in educational placement—even with the recently proposed\n\nmodifications—constitutes a “fundamental change” from the December 2013 IEP—G.B.’s\n\n“then-current educational placement.”\n\n       G.B.’s December 2013 IEP contemplated thirty-one hours of special education\n\ninstruction and one hour of behavioral support services in a fully separate special education\n\nsetting. Defendant’s proposed educational placement for G.B. contemplates (1) twenty-seven\n\nand a half hours of specialized instruction and related services, (2) G.B.’s exposure to her non-\n\ndisabled peers, and (3) lunch segregated from her peers and under adult supervision. The Court\n\nfinds that these three changes represent a fundamental alteration to G.B.’s educational\n\nplacement.\n\n       First, under Defendant’s proposed educational placement, G.B. will receive four and a\n\nhalf fewer hours of services per week because G.B. will not receive services during lunch or\n\ntransition periods as contemplated in her December 2013 IEP. Defendant appears to propose\n\nthat this gap in services can be filled by providing G.B. a dedicated aide to accompany her\n\nduring transition periods and “appropriate school personnel” to monitor her during lunch.\n\nHowever, Defendant offers no explanation as to how these modifications match the services\n\n                                                8\n\fprovided for in G.B.’s December 2013 IEP; specifically, whether the dedicated aide or school\n\nmonitor would provide the behavioral support services that the December 2013 IEP\n\ncontemplated G.B. would receive during these periods.          The Court finds that neither the\n\ndedicated aide nor the school monitor is an adequate substitute for the services that the\n\nDecember 2013 IEP contemplated G.B. would receive.              As presented by Defendant, the\n\ndedicated aide is intended to simply “accompany” G.B. during her transitions amongst her\n\nnondisabled peers throughout the school day and the school monitor is intended to simply\n\n“monitor” G.B. during lunch.       See Def.’s Opp’n at 3.      Moreover, it appears that neither\n\nindividual can provide the level of services required by G.B.’s December 2013 IEP because the\n\nIDEA does not permit paraprofessionals to provide specialized instruction or related services\n\nwithout the supervision of a special education teacher. See Assistance to States for the Education\n\nof Children With Disabilities and Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities, 71 Fed. Reg.\n\n46612 (Aug. 14, 2006) (the IDEA “should not be construed to permit or encourage the use of\n\nparaprofessionals as a replacement for teachers or related services providers who meet State\n\nqualification standards . . . these aides provide special education and related services to children\n\nwith disabilities only under the supervision of special education and related services\n\npersonnel.”). Indeed, G.B.’s December 2013 IEP, which contemplated a total of thirty-two hours\n\nof services entirely outside of the general education setting, specifically stated that a dedicated\n\naide was not required, strongly suggesting that a dedicated aide is not an individual capable of\n\nproviding the services G.B. requires during transition and lunch periods. Accordingly, the\n\npresence of a dedicated aide or school monitor during transitions and lunch is not a substitute for\n\nthe “counseling and behavior management [instruction G.B. is to receive] when interacting with\n\nher peers” during transitions and lunch per G.B.’s December 2013 IEP. Pls.’ Reply at 4-5.\n\n                                                 9\n\fDefendant’s proposed educational placement represents a substantial reduction in services.\n\n       In addition, the District’s proposed educational placement would expose G.B. to her non-\n\ndisabled peers during transitions in the school day. The December 2013 IEP, by contrast,\n\npurposefully contemplates that G.B. would receive her services in a fully separate setting for\n\ndisabled students. See Johnson v. District of Columbia, 962 F.Supp.2d 263, 269 (D.D.C. 2013)\n\n(crediting testimony by a DCPS employee that “when individuals create IEPs that are 32 hours,\n\nwhat they are actually trying to do is ensure that [the disabled students] do not engage with their\n\nnon-disabled peers during non-instructional time[,] which include[s] lunch and transition.”). The\n\nCourt finds Defendant’s attempt to remedy this difference by assigning G.B. a dedicated aide to\n\naccompany her during transitions amongst non-disabled students unavailing. A fundamental\n\naspect of G.B.’s December 2013 IEP was the requirement that all of G.B.’s services be provided\n\nto her outside of the general education setting to “prevent G.B. from being exposed to her non-\n\ndisabled peers at any point in time during the day.” Pl.’s Reply at 8. Even with a dedicated aide\n\nto accompany her, G.B. will still be exposed to her non-disabled peers. And, as previously\n\ndiscussed, the dedicated aide will not be able to provide G.B. with the requisite services to help\n\nG.B. navigate that exposure during these transition periods.4\n\n       Finally, beyond resulting in a reduction of services, the Court finds Defendant’s proposal\n\nthat G.B. spend lunch “separate from the general education population and monitored by\n\nappropriate school personnel” does not bring Defendant’s proposed educational placement closer\n\n\n\n       4\n          Plaintiffs also argue that assigning G.B. a dedicated aide to accompany her during her\ntransitions amongst the general education population does not ameliorate her exposure to that\npopulation because G.B. had been assigned a dedicated aide at Hart the day she was raped by\ntwo non-disabled students while transitioning to the bus. See Pls.’ TRO at 8; Pls.’ Ex. 13 at 3.\nHowever, it is unclear to the Court from the parties’ briefs whether the dedicated aide at Hart\nwas assigned to accompany G.B. during her transitions at Hart.\n                                                 10\n\fto G.B.’s December 2013 IEP, but instead makes the proposed placement more restrictive.\n\nWhile G.B.’s December 2013 IEP requires that she be separated from her non-disabled peers at\n\nlunch, it does not bar her from enjoying lunch with her disabled peers. Defendant’s proposed\n\neducational placement would appear to require G.B. to eat lunch alone without any of her peers\n\nbecause, “[d]ue to the structure of Cardozo,” disabled students “normally” eat lunch with their\n\nnondisabled peers in the general education setting. Def.’s Opp’n at 2.\n\n       In Lunceford, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that “a\n\nmove from a ‘mainstream’ program to one consisting only of handicapped students would\n\nconstitute a change in educational placement; a move from one mainstream program to another,\n\nwith the elimination of a theater arts class, would not be such a change.” 745 F.2d at 1582.\n\nHere, the Court finds that the four and a half hour per week reduction in important specialized\n\ninstruction and behavioral support services, the exposure to nondisabled students during\n\ntransition periods throughout the day, and the segregated lunch setting represent far more than\n\nmere programmatic variations in G.B.’s educational placement. Even with Defendant’s recently\n\nproposed modifications to the challenged December 2014 IEP, the District is seeking to place\n\nG.B. in a more mainstream setting than is clearly contemplated by G.B.’s December 2013 IEP—\n\nher “then-current educational placement.”      Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant’s\n\nproposed educational placement represents a fundamental change in the structure of and quantity\n\nand quality of services provided by G.B.’s educational placement entitling Plaintiffs to a “stay-\n\nput” injunction.\n\n                                      III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court shall GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary\n\nRestraining Order. Accordingly, if none of the DCPS schools can provide thirty-two hours of\n\n                                               11\n\fspecial education and related services as required by G.B.’s December 2013 IEP, as Plaintiff\n\ncontends, DCPS must provide G.B. with placement in a similar program during the pendency of\n\nadministrative proceedings.

District of\n\nColumbia, 748 F.Supp. 891, 898 n.9 (D.D.C.1990). Plaintiffs have suggested two non-public\n\nspecial education schools that appear to meet the requirements of G.B.’s December 2013 IEP:\n\nFrost School and Accotink Academy. Pls.’ TRO at 10. The Court will give Defendant the\n\nopportunity to file a Notice with the Court by no later than January 16, 2015, indicating whether\n\nthere is a DCPS school that can accommodate G.B.’s December 2013 IEP or whether G.B. will\n\nbe placed in a non-public special education school and the date on which G.B. will be placed in a\n\nproper educational placement. The Court expects G.B. to be placed in a proper educational\n\nplacement forthwith as she is presently at home and not receiving any educational benefits.\n\n       Because Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is identical to Plaintiffs’ Motion\n\nfor a TRO and because a TRO will expire after fourteen days, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2)—long\n\nbefore the administrative hearing officer will have rendered a decision regarding the challenged\n\n2014 IEP—the Court shall also GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction pending\n\nthe resolution of the administrative due process hearing. Nevertheless, the Court shall give\n\nDefendant the opportunity to object to the Court’s treatment of the Motion for Preliminary\n\nInjunction by no later than January 20, 2015, if Defendant believes there is a reason that\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction should not be treated the same as Plaintiffs’\n\nMotion for a TRO.\n\n       //\n\n       //\n\n                                               12\n\fAn appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            /s/\n                                        COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                   13\n\f",

G.B. has been\n\nidentified as eligible for special education and related services pursuant to the Individuals with\n\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act (“IDEA”),1 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. This suit invokes\n\nthe IDEA’s “stay-put” provision and seeks to force the District to fund G.B.’s placement in a\n\nnon-public educational program while the challenge to G.B.’s December 8, 2014, Individualized\n\nEducation Program (“IEP”) is under review by an administrative hearing officer. Concurrently\n\nwith the Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) and a\n\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. During a telephonic conference call with the Court, the\n\nparties agreed to a briefing schedule for Plaintiffs’ TRO request. Minute Order (Jan. 8, 2015).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The IDEA was re-authorized and re-codified pursuant to the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act in 2004, Pub. L. No. 108–446, 118 Stat. 2647\n(2004). The short title of the re-authorized and amended provisions remains the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act. See Pub. L. No. 108–446, § 101; 118 Stat. at 2647; 20 U.S.C. § 1400\n(2006). Accordingly, the Court refers to the amended Act herein as the IDEA.\n\fPlaintiffs’ Motion for a TRO is now fully briefed.2 After considering the parties’ briefs, the\n\naccompanying exhibits, and the applicable authorities, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled\n\nto a “stay-put” injunction. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order is\n\nGRANTED. As the grounds for Plaintiffs’ request for a Preliminary Injunction are identical to\n\nthe grounds for Plaintiffs’ TRO request, the Court also GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. [3], during the pendency of the administrative challenge.\n\n                                      I.     BACKGROUND\n\n   A. Statutory Framework\n\n   The IDEA was enacted to “ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a\n\nfree appropriate public education [“FAPE”] that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,\n\nemployment, and independent living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). Once a child is identified as\n\ndisabled, the school district within which the child resides must convene a meeting of a multi-\n\ndisciplinary team to develop an individualized education program (“IEP”) for the student. See §\n\n1414. “The IEP is in brief a comprehensive statement of the educational needs of a handicapped\n\nchild and the specially designed instruction and related services to be employed to meet those\n\nneeds.” Leonard v. McKenzie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519966\"><a href=\"/opinion/519966/brandon-leonard-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-thomas-mary-leonard-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1560 n.1 (D.C.

The IDEA further provides that\n\n       Except as provided in subsection (k)(4), during the pendency of any proceedings\n       conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency\n       and the parents otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current\n       educational placement of the child, or, if applying for initial admission to a public\n       school, shall, with the consent of the parents, be placed in the public school\n       program until all such proceedings have been completed.\n\nId. § 1415(j). Known as the “stay-put provision,” this section mandates that once a parent files a\n\ndue process complaint, “the child shall remain in the interim alternative educational setting\n\npending the decision of the hearing officer . . . unless the parent and the State or local\n\neducational agency agree otherwise.” Id. § 1415(k)(4); accord 34 C.F.R. § 300.518(a). The\n\npurpose of this provision is to prohibit “school officials from removing a child from the regular\n\npublic school classroom over the parents’ objection pending completion of the review\n\nproceedings.” Honig v.

Factual Background\n\n       The following facts are not disputed by the parties. G.B. is a thirteen year-old resident of\n\n                                                3\n\fthe District of Columbia who has been identified as a student with disabilities who is entitled to\n\nreceive special education and related services. Compl. ¶¶ 68, 69, 72. On October 16, 2013, the\n\nDistrict developed an IEP designed to provide G.B. with thirty-one hours of special education\n\ninstruction outside of the general education setting and one hour of behavioral support services\n\noutside of the general education setting for a total of thirty-two hours of services. Def.’s Opp’n\n\nat 1; Compl. ¶ 73. On December 13, 2013, the District reconvened the IEP team and developed\n\nanother IEP that again provided for thirty-one hours of special education instruction and one\n\nhour of behavioral support services outside of the general education setting. Def.’s Opp’n at 1;\n\nCompl. ¶ 74. Both IEPs “anticipated that [G.B.] would receive her services at a [District of\n\nColumbia Public Schools (“DCPS”)] school that had a fully separate special education setting,\n\nincluding separate entrance and lunchroom for special education students.” Def.’s Opp’n at 1.\n\n       The District identified the location for the provision of services as Hart Middle School\n\n(“Hart”) and G.B. was placed at Hart. Id. at 2; Compl. ¶ 76. However, Hart could only provide\n\nG.B. twenty-seven and a half hours of services per school week because it does not have a fully\n\nseparate special education setting. Id. In April 2014, G.B. was raped by two non-disabled\n\nstudents while transitioning to her bus at Hart. Compl. ¶ 78; Pls.’ TRO at 3, 8; Pls.’ Ex. 4\n\n(Children’s Hospital Medical Records). On December 8, 2014, the District reviewed and revised\n\nG.B.’s IEP to provide for twenty-seven and a half hours of specialized instruction and related\n\nservices. Def.’s Opp’n at 2; Compl. ¶¶ 97, 101. The District identified Cardozo High School as\n\nthe location for provision of G.B.’s IEP services. Def.’s Opp’n at 2; Compl. ¶ 102. “Due to the\n\nstructure of Cardozo, G.B. would normally have transitions and lunch with nondisabled peers.”\n\nDef.’s Opp’n at 2.\n\n       On December 31, 2014, Plaintiffs filed an administrative due process complaint before\n\n                                                4\n\fthe District’s Office of the State Superintendent of Education Office of Dispute Resolution\n\nchallenging, among other things, the December 8, 2014, IEP, and placement at Cardozo High\n\nSchool.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Since the “stay-put provision” imposes an automatic statutory injunction, the traditional\n\nfour-part test for an injunction does not apply. D.K. ex rel. Klein v.

Instead, the Court must\n\nanswer two questions to determine whether Plaintiffs are entitled to a stay-put injunction: (1)\n\nwhat was G.B.’s “then-current educational placement” at the time the due process complaint was\n\nfiled?; and (2) has the District proposed a “fundamental change” in G.B.’s educational program?\n\nJohnson v.

The December 2013 IEP provided for thirty-one hours per week of specialized\n\ninstruction “in an out of general education setting.” Pls.’ Ex. 3 (Dec. 2013 IEP), at 11. It also\n\nprovided for two hundred and forty minutes per month of Behavioral Support Services “in an out\n\nof general education setting.” Id. Behavioral Support Services were to “include counseling,\n\nbehavior management and consultation with teacher and parent to ensure that interventions are\n\nconsistently implemented in the school setting.” Id. at 9.3 As Defendant explains, “it was\n\nanticipated that the student would receive her services at a DCPS school that had a fully separate\n\nspecial education setting, including separate entrance and lunchroom for special education\n\n\n\n       3\n          The Court has placed G.B.’s IEPs under seal along with all of the exhibits Plaintiffs\nfiled in this case because they contain sensitive identifying information about G.B. and her\ndisability. The Court has directly quoted language from G.B.’s December 2013 IEP which is\nunder seal. However, the quoted language contains only a generic description of the services\nG.B. was to receive pursuant to the IEP and is akin to the information openly discussed by the\nparties in their briefing about the number of hours of services and types of services set forth in\nG.B.’s IEPs. Accordingly, the Court finds there is no reason to redact the language from G.B.’s\nDecember 2013 IEP that the Court has included in this Memorandum Opinion.\n                                                6\n\fstudents.” Def.’s Opp’n at 1. The December 2013 IEP did not require that G.B. receive the\n\nsupport of a dedicated aide. Pls.’ Ex. 3 (Dec. 2013 IEP), at 10.\n\n       Having identified G.B.’s “then-current educational placement,” the Court must now\n\nevaluate whether the District has proposed a fundamental change in G.B.’s educational\n\nplacement such that G.B. is entitled to be placed in her “then-current educational placement”\n\npending the resolution of Plaintiffs’ challenge to this proposed change.\n\n   B. Fundamental Change\n\n       At the outset, the Court notes that in response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a TRO, Defendant\n\nproposed several modifications to G.B.’s challenged December 2014 IEP in order “[t]o comply\n\nwith the maintenance of placement provision.” Def.’s Opp’n at 2-3. Specifically, Defendant\n\nproposed that G.B. “enjoy her lunch in a separate setting, which DCPS will provide, that will be\n\nseparate from the general education population and monitored by appropriate school personnel.”\n\nId. at 3.   Defendant also proposed that it “provide G.B. with a dedicated aide who will\n\naccompany her in her transitions between special education classes.” Id. Accordingly, the\n\nchange that Defendant is ultimately proposing in G.B.’s educational placement consists of a\n\nreduction from a total of thirty-two hours of specialized instruction and related services in a fully\n\nseparate special education setting to twenty-seven and a half hours of specialized instruction and\n\nrelated services with lunch in a setting separate from the general education population and\n\nmonitored by school personnel, and a dedicated aide to accompany G.B. in her transitions\n\nbetween special education classes.      Defendant argues that this newly proposed educational\n\nplacement “will not be a fundamental deviation from the December 13, 2013 IEP” as “the only\n\nde minimis difference [are] transitions among nondisabled peers with a dedicated aide.” Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n                                                 7\n\f       To be entitled to a “stay-put” injunction, Plaintiffs must identify a “change in the ‘general\n\neducational program in which a child . . . is enrolled, rather than mere variations in the program\n\nitself.’ ” Lunceford v.

The Court\n\nfinds that these three changes represent a fundamental alteration to G.B.’s educational\n\nplacement.\n\n       First, under Defendant’s proposed educational placement, G.B. will receive four and a\n\nhalf fewer hours of services per week because G.B. will not receive services during lunch or\n\ntransition periods as contemplated in her December 2013 IEP. Defendant appears to propose\n\nthat this gap in services can be filled by providing G.B. a dedicated aide to accompany her\n\nduring transition periods and “appropriate school personnel” to monitor her during lunch.\n\nHowever, Defendant offers no explanation as to how these modifications match the services\n\n                                                8\n\fprovided for in G.B.’s December 2013 IEP; specifically, whether the dedicated aide or school\n\nmonitor would provide the behavioral support services that the December 2013 IEP\n\ncontemplated G.B. would receive during these periods.          The Court finds that neither the\n\ndedicated aide nor the school monitor is an adequate substitute for the services that the\n\nDecember 2013 IEP contemplated G.B. would receive.              As presented by Defendant, the\n\ndedicated aide is intended to simply “accompany” G.B. during her transitions amongst her\n\nnondisabled peers throughout the school day and the school monitor is intended to simply\n\n“monitor” G.B. during lunch.       See Def.’s Opp’n at 3.      Moreover, it appears that neither\n\nindividual can provide the level of services required by G.B.’s December 2013 IEP because the\n\nIDEA does not permit paraprofessionals to provide specialized instruction or related services\n\nwithout the supervision of a special education teacher. See Assistance to States for the Education\n\nof Children With Disabilities and Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities, 71 Fed. Reg.\n\n46612 (Aug. 14, 2006) (the IDEA “should not be construed to permit or encourage the use of\n\nparaprofessionals as a replacement for teachers or related services providers who meet State\n\nqualification standards . . . these aides provide special education and related services to children\n\nwith disabilities only under the supervision of special education and related services\n\npersonnel.”). Indeed, G.B.’s December 2013 IEP, which contemplated a total of thirty-two hours\n\nof services entirely outside of the general education setting, specifically stated that a dedicated\n\naide was not required, strongly suggesting that a dedicated aide is not an individual capable of\n\nproviding the services G.B. requires during transition and lunch periods. Accordingly, the\n\npresence of a dedicated aide or school monitor during transitions and lunch is not a substitute for\n\nthe “counseling and behavior management [instruction G.B. is to receive] when interacting with\n\nher peers” during transitions and lunch per G.B.’s December 2013 IEP. Pls.’ Reply at 4-5.\n\n                                                 9\n\fDefendant’s proposed educational placement represents a substantial reduction in services.\n\n       In addition, the District’s proposed educational placement would expose G.B. to her non-\n\ndisabled peers during transitions in the school day. The December 2013 IEP, by contrast,\n\npurposefully contemplates that G.B. would receive her services in a fully separate setting for\n\ndisabled students. See Johnson v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (D.D.C. 2013)\n\n(crediting testimony by a DCPS employee that “when individuals create IEPs that are 32 hours,\n\nwhat they are actually trying to do is ensure that [the disabled students] do not engage with their\n\nnon-disabled peers during non-instructional time[,] which include[s] lunch and transition.”). The\n\nCourt finds Defendant’s attempt to remedy this difference by assigning G.B. a dedicated aide to\n\naccompany her during transitions amongst non-disabled students unavailing. A fundamental\n\naspect of G.B.’s December 2013 IEP was the requirement that all of G.B.’s services be provided\n\nto her outside of the general education setting to “prevent G.B. from being exposed to her non-\n\ndisabled peers at any point in time during the day.” Pl.’s Reply at 8. Even with a dedicated aide\n\nto accompany her, G.B. will still be exposed to her non-disabled peers. And, as previously\n\ndiscussed, the dedicated aide will not be able to provide G.B. with the requisite services to help\n\nG.B. navigate that exposure during these transition periods.4\n\n       Finally, beyond resulting in a reduction of services, the Court finds Defendant’s proposal\n\nthat G.B. spend lunch “separate from the general education population and monitored by\n\nappropriate school personnel” does not bring Defendant’s proposed educational placement closer\n\n\n\n       4\n          Plaintiffs also argue that assigning G.B. a dedicated aide to accompany her during her\ntransitions amongst the general education population does not ameliorate her exposure to that\npopulation because G.B. had been assigned a dedicated aide at Hart the day she was raped by\ntwo non-disabled students while transitioning to the bus. See Pls.’ TRO at 8; Pls.’ Ex. 13 at 3.\nHowever, it is unclear to the Court from the parties’ briefs whether the dedicated aide at Hart\nwas assigned to accompany G.B. during her transitions at Hart.\n                                                 10\n\fto G.B.’s December 2013 IEP, but instead makes the proposed placement more restrictive.\n\nWhile G.B.’s December 2013 IEP requires that she be separated from her non-disabled peers at\n\nlunch, it does not bar her from enjoying lunch with her disabled peers. Defendant’s proposed\n\neducational placement would appear to require G.B. to eat lunch alone without any of her peers\n\nbecause, “[d]ue to the structure of Cardozo,” disabled students “normally” eat lunch with their\n\nnondisabled peers in the general education setting. Def.’s Opp’n at 2.\n\n       In Lunceford, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that “a\n\nmove from a ‘mainstream’ program to one consisting only of handicapped students would\n\nconstitute a change in educational placement; a move from one mainstream program to another,\n\nwith the elimination of a theater arts class, would not be such a change.” 745 F.2d at 1582.\n\nHere, the Court finds that the four and a half hour per week reduction in important specialized\n\ninstruction and behavioral support services, the exposure to nondisabled students during\n\ntransition periods throughout the day, and the segregated lunch setting represent far more than\n\nmere programmatic variations in G.B.’s educational placement. Even with Defendant’s recently\n\nproposed modifications to the challenged December 2014 IEP, the District is seeking to place\n\nG.B. in a more mainstream setting than is clearly contemplated by G.B.’s December 2013 IEP—\n\nher “then-current educational placement.”      Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant’s\n\nproposed educational placement represents a fundamental change in the structure of and quantity\n\nand quality of services provided by G.B.’s educational placement entitling Plaintiffs to a “stay-\n\nput” injunction.\n\n                                      III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court shall GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary\n\nRestraining Order. Accordingly, if none of the DCPS schools can provide thirty-two hours of\n\n                                               11\n\fspecial education and related services as required by G.B.’s December 2013 IEP, as Plaintiff\n\ncontends, DCPS must provide G.B. with placement in a similar program during the pendency of\n\nadministrative proceedings.

Plaintiffs have suggested two non-public\n\nspecial education schools that appear to meet the requirements of G.B.’s December 2013 IEP:\n\nFrost School and Accotink Academy. Pls.’ TRO at 10. The Court will give Defendant the\n\nopportunity to file a Notice with the Court by no later than January 16, 2015, indicating whether\n\nthere is a DCPS school that can accommodate G.B.’s December 2013 IEP or whether G.B. will\n\nbe placed in a non-public special education school and the date on which G.B. will be placed in a\n\nproper educational placement. The Court expects G.B. to be placed in a proper educational\n\nplacement forthwith as she is presently at home and not receiving any educational benefits.\n\n       Because Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is identical to Plaintiffs’ Motion\n\nfor a TRO and because a TRO will expire after fourteen days, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2)—long\n\nbefore the administrative hearing officer will have rendered a decision regarding the challenged\n\n2014 IEP—the Court shall also GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction pending\n\nthe resolution of the administrative due process hearing. Nevertheless, the Court shall give\n\nDefendant the opportunity to object to the Court’s treatment of the Motion for Preliminary\n\nInjunction by no later than January 20, 2015, if Defendant believes there is a reason that\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction should not be treated the same as Plaintiffs’\n\nMotion for a TRO.\n\n       //\n\n       //\n\n                                               12\n\fAn appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            /s/\n                                        COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                   13\n\f</pre>",
