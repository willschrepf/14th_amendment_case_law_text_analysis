The first cause of action contests\n\nCustoms’s classification of the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as\n\n“Other . . . With outer surface of sheeting of plastic . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . .\n\nOther,” dutiable at a rate of 20% ad valorem. The second cause of action contests Customs’s\n\nappraisement decisions with regard to certain entries. Of the entries at issue in this action,\n\nplaintiffs contest the classification of thirty-nine entries. However, there are twenty-three other\n\nentries in which plaintiffs only contest the appraisement decisions made by Customs.9 Those\n\ntwenty-three entries are not reached by this opinion.\n\n\n\n        8\n         The eight causes of action consolidated under Court No. 94-08-00488 pursuant to U.S.\nCIT R. 42(a) include Court Nos.: 94-08-00488; 94-09-00550; 96-02-00600; 96-02-00601; 96-03-\n00753; 96-08-01946; 97-02-00223 and 97-02-00224.

Made with an outer surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and an inner lining of\n\npolyvinyl sheathing,11 the cosmetics bags are supple, non-rigid and not supported by frames.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs import the merchandise at issue for use as promotional items to be presented to\n\ncustomers upon the purchase of a certain amount of plaintiffs’ cosmetic and toiletry products,\n\neither as a free premium or at a nominal additional cost. Articles of merchandise are used to\n\ncontain, organize and segregate cosmetic and toiletry products and some are small enough to be\n\n\n       10\n           The Court notes plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as “cosmetic bags,” (see\nPlaintiffs’ Statement Under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts as to which There is No Dispute at ¶ 1\n(Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts)); however, throughout the opinion the Court will refer to the\nmerchandise at issue as “cosmetics bags” for the purposes of this opinion. The Court finds the\nterms to be synonymous.\n       11\n          The Court notes all the proposed classifications at issue in this matter may require the\nmerchandise at issue to have a plastic component in order for classification to be proper. See\nheading 4202, HTSUS (“[O]f sheeting of plastics”); subheading 4202.12.20 (“With outer surface\nof plastics”), subheading 4202.32.10 (“With outer surface of sheeting of plastic . . . Of reinforced\nor laminated plastics”), subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS (“With outer surface of sheeting of\nplastic”). Because this element of classification has been stipulated to by the parties and the\nCourt finds its understanding of the tariff phrase comports with that stipulation, the Court, in its\ndiscussion, will refer only to the contested subheadings and phrases, namely subheadings\n4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases,” 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind normally carried in the\npocket or the handbag,” and 4202.92.45, HTSUS, “Other . . .

Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss in Part\n\n       Plaintiffs oppose defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction certain entries for\n\nwhich plaintiffs did not protest classification. Plaintiffs argue defendant’s motion is premature,\n\nirrelevant to the cross-motions for summary judgment before the Court, and the Court should\n\ndeny the motion with leave for defendant to renew.\n\n\n\n       Even though plaintiffs admit no protests regarding classification were filed for the\n\ntwenty-three entries for which defendant seeks dismissal, plaintiffs contend the Court should\n\nproceed to determine the proper classification of the merchandise without dismissing the\n\nclassification claims with respect to those twenty-three entries. Plaintiffs argue the cross-\n\nmotions for partial summary judgment before the Court involve a legal question concerning the\n\nscope and meaning of three tariff provisions, and the Court’s judgment in no way depends upon\n\nhow many or which entries will be affected.

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n\n       Plaintiffs contend no genuine issues of material fact exist, and they are entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Len-Ron argues Customs improperly classified the cosmetics bags\n\nunder subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . . Other,”\n\ndutiable at a rate of 20% ad valorem. Plaintiffs also assert defendant’s proposed alternative\n\nclassification for the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as “[V]anity\n\ncases,” dutiable at a rate of 20% ad valorem, is incorrect. Len-Ron contends the merchandise at\n\nissue is classified properly under subheading 4202.32.10, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind\n\nnormally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,” dutiable at a rate of 12.1¢/kg + 4.6% ad\n\nvalorem.\n\n\n\n       a.      Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.32,\n               HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags at issue are normally carried by women in a handbag\n\nto hold, segregate and protect cosmetics. A cosmetics bag, plaintiffs argue, is similar to other\n\npersonal articles, e.g., wallet, change purse, organizer, women normally carry in their handbags\n\nfor daily use. Plaintiffs maintain the cosmetics bags at issue are not carried normally as a\n\nseparate bag or container. Therefore, plaintiffs argue subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                         Page 9\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\na kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag” encompasses the merchandise at issue.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs also argue legislative history supports classification of the cosmetics bags under\n\nsubheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Len-Ron contends analysis of the statute establishes subheading\n\n4202.32, HTSUS, as a use provision. Plaintiffs maintain legislative history supports a use-based\n\ninterpretation of the statute rather than one based solely on the exemplars listed in the statute and\n\nExplanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02, HTSUS.14 According to plaintiffs, the Harmonized System\n\nCommittee (HSC) of the Customs Cooperation Council’s use of the phrase “Articles of a kind\n\nnormally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,” instead of the exemplar-based Tariff Schedule\n\nof the United States (TSUS) provision for “flat goods,”15 illustrates the HSC’s intention for the\n\nsubheading to cover a broad base of similar articles characterized by their use as containers for\n\narticles carried on the person. Plaintiffs maintain the subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is not\n\nlimited, by it own terms or by the intent of the drafters, to the specific articles enumerated in\n\nheading 4202, i.e., wallets, purses, map cases, cigarette cases, similar containers, or in the\n\n\n\n       14\n          The Explanatory Notes are the official interpretation of the scope of the Harmonized\nCommodity Description and Coding System (which served as the basis of the HTSUS) as viewed\nby the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC), the international organization that drafted the\ninternational nomenclature. See E.M. Chemicals v. United States, 923 F. Supp. 202, 207 n.6\n(CIT 1996).\n       15\n        The Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUS), schedule 7, part 1, subpart D,\nHeadnote 2(c) (1986), provided that the term “flat goods” covered:\n\n       small flatwares designed to be carried on the person, such as banknote cases, bill cases,\n       billfolds, bill purses, bill rolls, card cases, change purses, cigarette cases, coin purses,\n       coin holders, compacts, currency cases, key cases, letter cases, license cases, money\n       cases, pass cases, passport cases, powder cases, spectacle cases, stamp cases, vanity cases,\n       tobacco pouches, and similar articles.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 10\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nExplanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02, HTSUS, i.e., “similar containers” in second part of heading\n\n4202, HTSUS, as including note-cases, writing cases, pen-cases, ticket-cases, cigar-cases, etc.16\n\nPlaintiffs maintain, the Explanatory Note clearly shows this heading continues to include flat\n\ngoods; however, unlike the subheading used in the TSUS, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, will be\n\ngoverned by use, not exemplars. Therefore, plaintiffs argue, since the merchandise at issue is to\n\nbe used or carried within a handbag, it squarely falls under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS,\n\n“Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n\n\n       Also, plaintiffs argue, while the exemplars in the statute and Explanatory Notes may not\n\nbe used as limitations for classification under heading 4202.32, they are relevant for determining\n\nthe essential characteristics, under the ejusdem generis rule of statutory construction,17 of items\n\nclassifiable within subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Plaintiffs assert the cosmetics bags at issue\n\nshare the essential characteristics of the exemplars enumerated in the statute and Explanatory\n\n\n\n       16\n          The Court notes the Explanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02 state, in relevant part:\n“[Subheadings 4202.31, 4202.32, and 4202.39] cover articles of a kind normally carried in the\npocket or in the handbag and include spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-folds), wallets, purses, key-\ncases, cigarette-cases, cigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches.”\n       17\n         Ejusdem generis, which means “of the same kind,” is a rule of statutory construction\nproviding:\n\n       where an enumeration of specific things is followed by a general word or phrase, the\n       general word or phrase is held to refer to things of the same kind as those specified. As\n       applicable to classification cases, ejusdem generis requires that the imported merchandise\n       possess the essential characteristics or purposes that unite the articles enumerated eo\n       nomine in order to be classified under the general terms.\n\nSports Graphics, Inc. v. United States, 24 F.3d 1390, 1392 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 11\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nNotes. Like the exemplars, the merchandise at issue is small, lightly constructed and designed to\n\nbe carried in a handbag and is normally so carried. Therefore, the merchandise at issue is\n\nproperly classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried\n\nin the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n\n\n                 b.      Improper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading\n                         4202.92.45, HTSUS, as “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . .\n                         Other.”\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue is not classifiable under subheading 4202.92.45,\n\nHTSUS, as “Other . . . With outer surface of sheeting of plastic . . . Travel, sports and similar\n\nbags . . . Other,” dutiable at a rate of 20% ad valorem. First, plaintiffs contend Customs\n\nimproperly classified the merchandise at issue within a residuary subheading without\n\ndetermining first whether the article was classifiable within any of the other available\n\nsubheadings. Plaintiffs maintain the merchandise at issue is prima facie classifiable under\n\nsubheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Without refutation of this classification, plaintiffs argue,\n\nCustoms’s classification of the cosmetics bags under the residuary subheading in Chapter 42,\n\nHTSUS, “Other” is improper. Moreover, plaintiffs contend Additional U.S. Note 1 (U.S. Note\n\n1)18 requires Customs to exclude the merchandise at issue from classification under subheading\n\n4202.32, HTSUS, prior to using subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, “Other.”\n\n       18\n            Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1 (U.S. Note 1) states, in relevant part:\n\n       For the purposes of heading 4202, the expression “travel, sports and similar bags” means\n       goods, other than those falling in subheadings 4202.11 through 4202.39, of a kind\n       designed for carrying clothing and other personal effects during travel, including\n       backpacks and shopping bags of this heading . . . .\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                    Page 12\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n\n\n       Second, plaintiffs contend Customs’s classification under subheading 4202.92, HTSUS,\n\n“Other” is contrary to the classification methodology set forth by the General Rules of\n\nInterpretation (GRI). GRI 619 instructs comparisons be made only between tariff provisions at\n\nthe same level of the tariff hierarchy. Len-Ron argues Customs’s rationale for classification\n\nunder subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, is based upon a comparison of two provisions that are not\n\ncomparable, “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,” a subheading\n\nand “Travel, sports and similar bags,” a subordinate division of the subheading “Other.”\n\nPlaintiffs argue Customs’s interpretation and analysis of the merchandise at issue under the\n\nHTSUS is erroneous.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs further argue, even if the merchandise at issue is prima facie classifiable under\n\nsubheading 4202.32, HTSUS, and subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, GRI 3(a)20 would mandate\n\n\n\n       19\n            General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 6 states:\n\n       For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be\n       determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes\n       and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at\n       the same level are comparable.\n\n       20\n            GRI 3(a) states, in pertinent part:\n\n       When, by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie,\n       classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\n\n       (a)       The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to\n                 headings providing a more general description.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 13\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nclassification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, because it offers “the most specific\n\ndescription” of the merchandise at issue. Moreover, even if the subheading 4202.32, HTSUS,\n\ncould be compared with subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar\n\nbags . . . Other,” plaintiffs contend, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, would still be the proper\n\nclassification because the merchandise at issue does not share essential characteristics with the\n\nexemplars enumerated under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS. Citing U.S. Note 1 to Chapter 42\n\nof the HTSUS, plaintiffs maintain, unlike travel, sports and similar bags, the merchandise at\n\nissue is not designed to carry clothing and other personal effects during travel. Also, plaintiffs\n\nargue the merchandise at issue is not designed to be carried independently but within another\n\ncontainer. Therefore, plaintiffs assert the merchandise at issue may not be properly classified\n\nunder subheading 4202.92.45, as “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . . Other.”\n\n\n\n               c.      Improper Classification under Subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, “[V]anity\n                       cases.”\n\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags may not be classified properly under the eo nomine21\n\ntariff term “[V]anity cases” in subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.\n\n\n\n       First, plaintiffs contend the term “[V]anity cases” is ambiguous and dictionary definitions\n\nof the term and expert testimony reveal three distinct forms of the article: a compact, a handbag\n\nand a small piece of luggage. Plaintiffs maintain the statute refers to the third definition, a small\n\n       21\n         An eo nomine designation is one which describes a “commodity by a specific name,\nusually one well known to commerce.” United States v. Bruckmann, 582 F.2d 622, 625 n.8\n(CCPA 1978).\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                         Page 14\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\npiece of luggage. Plaintiffs base their argument on the drafting history of the Harmonized Tariff\n\nSchedule (HTS). Len-Ron notes the HTS is a multi-national tariff with international\n\nnomenclature, and the meaning of a term must be construed in the context of the various\n\nlanguages in which the HTS is written. According to plaintiffs, under the international\n\nnomenclature, HTS headings and subheadings should encompass the same items despite\n\nlanguage differences. Plaintiffs contend the first part of the heading 4202, i.e., “Trunks,\n\nsuitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases,\n\ncamera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers . . . ,” which\n\nincludes the term “vanity cases,” was intended to include items of luggage. Comparing the\n\nEnglish and French terminology under heading 4202, HTSUS, plaintiffs maintain the term\n\n“vanity cases” was intended by the drafters to be equivalent to the French term “les mallettes de\n\ntoilettes,” i.e., little trunks for toilet articles. According to plaintiffs, the merchandise at issue\n\ndoes not meet this definition.\n\n\n\n        In addition, plaintiffs argue, under the rule of ejusdem generis, the cosmetics bags do not\n\nshare essential characteristics with the containers listed in the first part of heading 4202 or in\n\nsubheadings 4202.12, HTSUS, “Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school\n\nsatchels and similar containers [e.g., hat boxes, camera accessory cases, cartridge pouches,\n\nsheaths for hunting or camping knives . . . . See Ch. 42.02, Explanatory Notes].” Plaintiffs\n\nmaintain all the exemplars are designed to be carried independently as external bags, unlike the\n\nmerchandise at issue. Therefore, plaintiffs contend the eo nomine provision of “vanity cases”\n\nunder which defendant would classify the cosmetics bags has been shown by definition,\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                       Page 15\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nlegislative history and similitude to be limited to the type of vanity case that resembles a small\n\nsuitcase for cosmetics. Therefore, plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue may not be classified\n\nproperly under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as “[V]anity cases.”\n\n\n\n        For all the reasons cited above, plaintiffs assert the proper classification of the\n\nmerchandise at issue is under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally\n\ncarried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n\n\nB.      Defendant\n\n        1.      Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss in Part\n\n        Pursuant to U.S. CIT R. 12(b), defendant, United States, moves to dismiss the twenty-\n\nthree entries for which classification was not protested. Defendant argues it is fundamental that\n\nin order for the Court to have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) over the twenty-three entries\n\nat issue in this motion, it was necessary for plaintiffs to have protested Customs’s classification\n\nfor each entry pursuant to 19 U.S.C. §§ 1514 and 1515. The government contends because\n\nplaintiffs did not protest the classification of the twenty-three entries it seeks to dismiss, the\n\nCourt may not properly exercise jurisdiction over those entries. Accordingly, defendant moves\n\nfor dismissal with respect to those twenty-three entries.\n\n\n\n\n        2.      Defendant’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n        Defendant argues there are no issues of material fact, and it is entitled to judgment as a\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                    Page 16\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nmatter of law. Defendant contends the cosmetics bags at issue should be classified under\n\nsubheading 4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases,” and, in the alternative, under subheading\n\n4202.92.45, HTSUS, “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . . Other.” Defendant maintains\n\nthe cosmetics bags are not classifiable properly under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of\n\na kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n\n\n                 a.     Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading\n                        4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases.”\n\n          Defendant argues the cosmetics bags should be classified under subheading 4202.12,\n\nHTSUS, an eo nomine provision for “vanity cases.” Finding the term ambiguous, defendant\n\nacknowledges the common dictionary meaning of the term “vanity case” includes several forms\n\nof the article, e.g., a small luggage bag for holding cosmetics, small container to carry cosmetic\n\naccessories. Even so, defendant argues Congress is presumed to know the language of commerce\n\nso as to classify commodities according to the general usage and denomination of the trade;\n\ntherefore, in the absence of legislative intent, an eo nomine provision includes all forms of an\n\narticle. Defendant contends the merchandise at issue fits squarely within the common meaning\n\nof the term “vanity cases” as used in the HTSUS. Defendant asserts a vanity case is a small\n\nhandbag or case for carrying cosmetics. Customs notes plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at\n\nissue as cosmetics cases, defined as a small piece of luggage for cosmetics. Based on the\n\nsimilarity of their definitions, defendant argues a cosmetic case is a vanity case. Therefore, the\n\nmerchandise at issue may be classified properly under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as “[V]anity\n\ncases.”\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 17\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n       Defendant also argues plaintiffs may not argue under the rule of ejusdem generis to refute\n\nclassification of the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS. Defendant contends\n\nsince the merchandise at issue falls squarely within the common meaning of the term “[V]anity\n\ncase[]” in the subheading, ejusdem generis may not be used to restrict the scope of the provision.\n\nDefendant contends the common meaning of the term “vanity case” is clear. Therefore, rules of\n\nconstruction such as ejusdem generis may not be used to narrow the term’s common meaning.\n\n\n\n       Even so, defendant contends, if the rule of ejusdem generis applies and the term “vanity\n\ncases,” in fact, only applies to luggage, the cosmetics bags would still be classifiable under\n\nsubheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as “similar containers.” Defendant argues all the articles\n\nenumerated in subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, are traveling bags used to carry different types of\n\narticles. Since the rule of ejusdem generis requires only that the merchandise possess the\n\nessential character running through all enumerated exemplars, defendant maintains the\n\nmerchandise at issue is ejusdem generis because it is a travel bag used to carry cosmetics.\n\nDefendant contends plaintiffs’ argument using ejusdem generis has no merit.\n\n\n\n               b.      Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading\n                       4202.92.45, HTSUS, as “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . .\n                       Other.”\n\n       Alternatively, Customs argues the cosmetics bags were classified properly upon entry\n\nunder subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as “Other . . .Travel, sports and similar bags . . . Other.”\n\nDefendant maintains, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions, it classified the merchandise under the\n\nresiduary subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, by relying upon the plain meaning of the statute and not\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 18\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nupon a comparison between subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind normally carried in\n\nthe pocket or in the handbag” and subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, “Other.” According to\n\nCustoms, the cosmetics bags are not classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS; therefore,\n\nCustoms’s choice of the residuary subheading was appropriate.\n\n\n\n          According to Customs, the cosmetics bags fall under the statutory definition of “[t]ravel,\n\nsports and similar bags” as provided by Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, HTSUS, “goods . . .\n\nof a kind designed for carrying clothing and other personal effects during travel.” Defendant\n\nargues plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as travel bags, cases and pouches in marketing\n\nand advertising literature and, according to plaintiffs, the merchandise is designed to carry\n\npersonal effects such as cosmetics. Accordingly, contends defendant, the cosmetics bags meet\n\nthe statutory definition of “Travel, sports and similar bags” and therefore, it was classified\n\nproperly under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . .\n\nOther.”\n\n\n\n                 c.      Improper Classification under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of\n                         a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n          Customs argues the language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is plain and unambiguous,\n\nand the merchandise at issue may not be classified properly under the subheading. Customs\n\ncontends the statutory phrase “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the\n\nhandbag,” was intended by Congress to refer only to small pocket articles. To bolster its\n\nargument, Customs cites the exemplars enumerated in the Explanatory Notes as “Articles of a\n\nkind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,” i.e., spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                    Page 19\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nfolds), wallets, purses, key-cases, cigarette-cases, cigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches.\n\nDefendant claims the fact all these items may be carried in the pocket as well as in the handbag\n\nillustrates subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was only meant to include items which are capable of\n\nbeing carried in a pocket. Therefore, argues Customs, this size limitation precludes classification\n\nof the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, because the cosmetics bags are\n\nnot small pocket articles.\n\n\n\n       In addition, defendant uses HTS drafting history to support the validity of its conclusion\n\nthat the plain meaning of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, only implicates small pocket articles.\n\nCustoms argues, in 1978, the United States Administration proposed to the HSC an additional\n\nsubheading for “flat goods” in heading 4202 which the United States’ delegate explained was\n\nintended to give separate status to small pocket articles. According to defendant, the HSC agreed\n\nwith the United States about the need for an additional subheading but in lieu of the phrase “flat\n\ngoods” chose the phrase “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\nDefendant contends the phrase used in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was borrowed from\n\nChapter 71 of the HTSUS and its Explanatory Notes classifying articles of jewelry, all of which\n\nmay be carried in the pocket.22 Also, defendant notes similar language was in use in the TSUS to\n\ndefine articles of jewelry, and a variation of this language was used to define “flat goods.”\n\nDefendant contends since the HSC essentially adopted the United States “flat goods” proposal in\n\n\n\n       22\n            Chapter 71, Note 8(b), HTSUS, provides:\n\n       (b) Articles of personal use of a kind normally carried in the pocket, in the handbag or on\n       the person (such as cigarette cases, powder boxes, chain purses or pill boxes.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v.

Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nthe Explanatory Notes, although under a different title, and since, according to the U.S. delegate,\n\nthe “flat goods” provision was intended to include only small pocket articles, subheading\n\n4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag” was\n\nintended only to cover small pocket articles.\n\n\n\n       In addition, defendant contends when Congress recast the TSUS “flat goods” provision in\n\nthe Explanatory Notes, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,” it\n\nremoved the term “vanity cases” from the exemplars that had been enumerated in the TSUS\n\nprovision. According to Customs, the regrouping of “vanity cases” in an alternative subheading\n\n4202.12, HTSUS, limited the scope of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, to small pocket articles. By\n\nchanging the language of the recast flat goods provision to include only articles of a kind\n\nnormally carried in the pocket or in the handbag and providing for vanity cases in a separate\n\nprovision, Congress manifested an obvious intent to treat vanity cases separately and distinctly\n\nfrom those articles with which they had been grouped under the TSUS. Therefore, the\n\nmerchandise at issue is not classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind\n\nnormally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\n\n\n       Customs also argues plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the cosmetics bags are “of a kind”\n\nnormally carried in the pocket or in the handbag as required by the plain meaning of the statute.\n\nCustoms notes classification within headings and subheadings using the phrase “of a kind” is\n\ncontrolled by use. Pursuant to the instruction of Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a),\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                       Page 21\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nHTSUS,23 defendant contends the cosmetics bags are not of the “class or kind” of goods\n\ndescribed in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket\n\nor in the handbag” because the merchandise at issue is not commercially fungible24 with those\n\nitems which define the class or kind of articles covered by subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.\n\nAccording to defendant, plaintiffs have produced no evidence of commercial fungibility.\n\nDefendant maintains, under the plain meaning subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, the cosmetics bags\n\nmay not be classified properly as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the\n\nhandbag.”\n\n\n\n       For all these reasons, defendant argues the proper classification for the merchandise at\n\nissue is subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases.”\n\n\n\n                    III. MOTION TO DISMISS IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION\n\n       When a defendant challenges the Court’s jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the burden of\n\ndemonstrating jurisdiction exists. See Lowa, Ltd. v. United States, 561 F. Supp. 441, 443 (CIT\n\n\n       23\n            Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       (a)       a tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined\n                 in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the\n                 date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods\n                 belong, and the controlling use is the principal use . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added).\n       24\n           Defendant cites the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision in\nPrimal Lite, Inc. v. United States, 182 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999) to support its argument\nthat articles are of the same “class or kind” as required by Additional Rule of Interpretation 1(a),\nHTSUS, if “commercially fungible.” Primal Lite, 182 F.3d at 1365.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v.

Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n1983).\n\n\n\n         Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a), this Court has “exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action\n\ncommenced to contest the denial of a protest, in whole or in part, under section 515 of the Tariff\n\nAct of 1930 [the Act].” Codified at 19 U.S.C. § 1515(a) (1994), section 515(a) of the Act\n\nprovides, “the appropriate customs officer, within two years from the date a protest was filed in\n\naccordance with section 1514 of this title, shall review the protest and shall allow or deny such\n\nprotest in whole or in part.” Section 1514(a) states decisions of the Customs Service including\n\n“the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable . . . shall be final and conclusive\n\nupon all persons . . . unless a protest is filed in accordance with this section.” 19 U.S.C. §\n\n1514(a).\n\n\n\n         Plaintiffs do not dispute their failure to file protests regarding the classification of the\n\ntwenty-three entries at issue in defendant’s motion to dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, because no protests were filed, the classification of the twenty-three entries at issue is\n\nfinal and conclusive. See United States v. Ataka Am., Inc., 826 F. Supp. 495, 502 (CIT 1993)\n\n(“Failure to protest [classification] results in the finality of the decision.”). Accordingly, the\n\nCourt finds it lacks jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) over those non-protested entries and\n\ngrants defendant’s motion dismissing the twenty-three entries at issue with respect to the\n\nclassification cause of action. See Computime, Inc. v. United States, 601 F. Supp. 1029, 1031\n\n(CIT 1984). This Court makes no determination as to how the twenty-three entries may be\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v.

CROSS-MOTIONS FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       This case is before the Court on plaintiffs’ motion and defendant’s cross-motion for\n\npartial summary judgment. Under U.S. CIT R. 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate if, based\n\non the papers before the Court, “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact” and “the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” When deciding summary judgment\n\nmotions in classification cases, the Court must first ascertain the proper meaning of the specific\n\nterms in the tariff provision, a question of law, and second determine whether the merchandise at\n\nissue comes within the description of such terms as properly construed, a question of fact. See\n\nSGI, Inc. v. United States, 122 F.3d 1468, 1471 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The parties claim there are no\n\ngenuine issues as to any material facts; therefore partial summary judgment is appropriate in this\n\nmatter. This Court agrees.\n\n\n\n       The sole issue before the Court is a question of law26 pertaining to the proper\n\ninterpretation of pertinent sections of the HTSUS. See id. (citing Rollerblade, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 112 F.3d 481, 483 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). The Court will conduct a de novo review of this\n\n\n       25\n            This Court will address the appraisement cause of action separately.\n       26\n         Customs’s decisions are entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. §\n2639(a)(1) (1994); however, where “a question of law is before the Court on a motion for\nsummary judgment, the statutory presumption of correctness is irrelevant.” Blakley Corp. v.\nUnited States, 15 F. Supp. 2d 865, 869 (CIT 1998) (citing Universal Elecs., Inc. v. United States,\n112 F.3d 488, 492 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                   Page 24\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nmatter based on the record before it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2640(a)(1) (1994).27 See Gulfstream\n\nAerospace Corp. v. United States, 981 F. Supp. 654, 658 (CIT 1997). In making its\n\ndetermination as to the proper classification under the HTSUS, the Court must consider whether\n\n“the government’s classification is correct, both independently and in comparison with the\n\nimporter’s alternative.” Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States, 733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed. Cir. 1984).\n\n\n\nB.     Classification Under the HTSUS\n\n       The proper classification of merchandise entering the United States is directed by the\n\nGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI) of the HTSUS and the Additional United States Rules of\n\nInterpretation. See Orlando Food Corp. v. United States, 140 F.3d 1437, 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n\nThe HTSUS scheme is organized by headings; each of which has one or more subheadings\n\nproviding a more particularized segregation of the heading at issue. See id. Under the GRI, the\n\nCourt must first construe the language of the heading and any section or chapter notes in question\n\nto determine whether the product at issue is classifiable under the heading. Only then may the\n\nCourt look to the subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise at issue. See\n\nid. at 1440; GRI 1, 6.28\n\n\n       27\n          In this case, Customs has not promulgated any regulations interpreting the relevant\nheadings or subheadings; therefore, the Court will conduct de novo review based on the record\nbefore it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2640(a)(1) (1994). See Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, 195\nF.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Mead Corp. v. United States, 185 F.3d 1304, 1307 (Fed.\nCir. 1999)).\n       28\n         General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 1 states, in pertinent part, “[C]lassification shall\nbe determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes . . .\n.”\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                      Page 25\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n       “As with other statutory provisions, it is the function of the court to interpret the tariff\n\nacts in a manner that will fulfill or carry out the intent of Congress.” Neco Elec. Prods. v. United\n\nStates, 14 CIT 181, 183 (1990). To ascertain Congress’ intent, the Court first looks to the plain\n\nmeaning of the statutory text. See Marcor Dev. Corp. v. United States, 926 F. Supp. 1124, 1129\n\n(CIT 1996) (citing Trans-Border Customs Servs. v. United States, 843 F. Supp. 1482, 1485 (CIT\n\n1994)). If the plain language of the statute demonstrates the clear and unambiguous intent of\n\nCongress, the Court’s inquiry is complete. See id. However, absent any contrary indication of\n\nCongressional intent from the statute or legislative history, tariff terms are construed in\n\naccordance with their common and popular meaning. See Lynteq, Inc. v. United States, 976 F.2d\n\n693, 697 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In construing such terms, the Court may “‘rely upon its own\n\nunderstanding, dictionaries and other reliable sources.’” North Am. Processing Co. v. United\n\nStates, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1179 (CIT 1999) (quoting Medline Indus., Inc. v. United States, 62\n\nF.3d 1407, 1409 (Fed. Cir. 1995)).\n\n\n\n       1.       Heading 4202, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases . . . similar containers . . . traveling bags,\n                toiletry bags . . . purses . . . similar containers . . . .”\n\n\n       In this matter, the parties’ arguments principally address the proper subheading\n\n\n\nGRI 6 states:\n\n       For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be\n       determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes\n       and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at\n       the same level are comparable.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                           Page 26\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nclassification within heading 4202, HTSUS, for the merchandise at issue. The parties appear to\n\nagree the cosmetics bags are properly classified under heading 4202, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases . . .\n\nand similar containers; . . . traveling bags, toiletry bags . . . purses . . . and similar containers . . .\n\n.” Even so, pursuant to Jarvis Clark, 733 F.2d at 878, the Court must consider whether\n\nclassification of the merchandise at issue is, in fact, appropriate under heading 4202, HTSUS.\n\n\n\n        Heading 4202, HTSUS, is comprised of a list of exemplars some of which arguably\n\ndescribe the merchandise at issue in this matter. Defendant argues the merchandise at issue may\n\nbe considered as “vanity cases,” “traveling bags,” “toiletry bags,” or “similar containers.”\n\nPlaintiffs appear to argue the merchandise at issue, which they refer to as cosmetics bags, may be\n\nconsidered as “similar containers” in the second part of heading 4202, HTSUS. (See Defendant’s\n\nMotion at 7, 16; Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Motion) at 17.) Because the Court finds the language of heading 4202, HTSUS, is\n\nunclear and legislative history provides this Court with no clarification as to those exemplars or\n\nphrases in heading 4202, HTSUS, under which the merchandise at issue may be classified\n\nproperly, the Court will use the rule of ejusdem generis to ascertain whether the merchandise at\n\nissue may be classified properly under heading 4202, HTSUS.\n\n\n\n        In applying the rule of ejusdem generis, the Court must consider whether the merchandise\n\nat issue possesses the essential characteristics or purposes that unite the listed examples\n\npreceding the general term or phrase in the statute. See Avenues in Leather, Inc. v. United States,\n\n178 F.3d 1241, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1999). It is well-established that the essential characteristic and\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 27\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\npurposes of the heading 4202, HTSUS, exemplars is “to organize, store, protect and carry various\n\nitems.” SGI, Inc., 122 F.3d at 1471; Totes, Inc. v. United States, 865 F. Supp. 867, 872 (CIT\n\n1994). In this matter, the parties stipulate the cosmetics bags are used to contain, “organize and\n\nsegregate cosmetics [and toiletry products.]” (Plaintiffs’ Statement Under Rule 56(i) of Material\n\nFacts as to Which There is No Dispute (Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts) at ¶ 10; Defendant’s\n\nResponse to Plaintiffs’ Statement under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts As to Which There is No\n\nDispute (Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Facts) at ¶ 10 (Admits but avers irrelevant).) Due\n\nto the breadth of exemplars listed in heading 4202, HTSUS, the exemplars’ essential\n\ncharacteristics and purpose, the parties’ stipulation, and the Court’s inability to find any other\n\nappropriate heading, the Court finds the merchandise at issue properly classified under heading\n\n4202, HTSUS, because it is used to organize personal items, i.e., cosmetics.\n\n\n\n          2.     Proposed Subheading Classifications within Heading 4202, HTSUS.\n\n          In this matter, the parties advance three subheadings within heading 4202, HTSUS, as\n\npossible classifications for the merchandise at issue: subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as “[V]anity\n\ncases;” subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in\n\nthe handbag;” subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . .\n\nOther.”\n\n\n                 a.     Merchandise at Issue Prima Facie Classifiable under Subheading\n                        4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases.”\n\n          Defendant argues the cosmetics bags are properly classifiable under subheading 4202.12,\n\nHTSUS, as “[V]anity cases.” Plaintiffs oppose this classification. This Court agrees with\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                   Page 28\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\ndefendant that the merchandise at issue is prima facie classifiable under subheading 4202.12,\n\nHTSUS.\n\n\n\n       Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases” is an eo nomine tariff designation.29 Even\n\nso, the Court finds the term is not clearly defined by the headings, subheadings, or chapter notes\n\nof Chapter 42, HTSUS. In addition, the Court finds Congress did not specify its intent as to the\n\nterm “vanity cases.” See subheading 4202.12, HTSUS. Thus, the Court must determine the\n\ncommon meaning of the term “[V]anity case” as used in the statute. See North Am., 56 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 1178.\n\n\n\n       Various definitions of the term “vanity case” are advanced by “dictionaries and other\n\nreliable sources” to which the Court looks to discern a tariff term’s common meaning. Id. at\n\n1179. The OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 430 (2d. ed. 1989) defines “vanity case” as “a small\n\nhand-bag, etc., for ladies, fitted with a mirror and powder-puff.” According to the AMERICAN\n\nHERITAGE DICTIONARY 1944 (3rd ed. 1996), a “vanity case” is “ 1. [a] small handbag or case used\n\nby women for carrying cosmetics or toiletries. 2. a woman’s compact.” The RANDOM HOUSE\n\nDICTIONARY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1580 (1966) defines the term as “a small luggage bag or\n\ncase for holding cosmetics or toiletries used or carried by women.” The Court notes the common\n\nmeaning of the term “vanity case” appears to include various forms of the article: a compact; a\n\nsmall handbag or case used by women for carrying cosmetics; and a small luggage bag for\n\ncosmetics.\n\n       29\n            See supra note 21.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                   Page 29\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the term “[V]anity case[]” as used in heading 4202, HTSUS, and\n\nsubheading 4202.12, HTSUS, only refers to a small piece of luggage for cosmetics. Plaintiffs\n\nbase their argument on the Session Notes of the Harmonized System Committee (HSC) of the\n\nCustoms Cooperation Council and its working party. Comparing terminology in the French and\n\nEnglish versions of the HTS, plaintiffs maintain, the term “[V]anity cases,” as used in the\n\nHTSUS, was intended to be the equivalent of the French term “les mallettes de toillettes,” i.e.,\n\nlittle trunk for toilet articles. The Court finds plaintiffs’ argument unpersuasive.30\n\n\n\n       “Congress is presumed to know the language of commerce, and to have framed tariff acts\n\nso as to classify commodities according to the general usage and denomination of the trade.”\n\nJohn v. Carr & Son, Inc. v. United States, 77 Cust. Ct. 103, 107 (1976). Therefore, because\n\nCongress used the term “vanity cases” within the statute without limitation as to form, it may be\n\npresumed all forms of the articles are meant by Congress to be included therein. “‘[A]n eo\n\nnomine designation, with no terms of limitation, will ordinarily include all forms of the named\n\narticle.’” Carl Ziess, 195 F.3d at 1379 (quoting Hayes-Sammons Chem. Co. v. United States, 55\n\nCCPA 69, 75 (1968)). Because the Court finds the common meaning of the term “vanity case[]”\n\nincludes a small handbag or case used to hold cosmetics, the Court finds the merchandise at issue\n\nin this matter, described by the parties as cosmetics bags used to contain cosmetics, prima facie\n\n       30\n          Both parties support their arguments by citing to the Session Notes of the Customs\nCooperation Council’s Harmonized System Committee and its Working Party. The Court notes,\nhowever, working documents, such as commentary by delegations on questions before\nHarmonized System Committee which are designed to frame issues for discussion, carry virtually\nno weight in interpreting the Harmonized System even though they may contain more detailed\ndescriptions of the goods under consideration and the rationale for certain positions. See STRUM,\nR., CUSTOMS LAW & ADMINISTRATION, § 50.2, 17 (Supp. 1999).\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                   Page 30\nConsol.

Merchandise at Issue Prima Facie Classifiable under Subheading\n                       4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in\n                       the handbag.”\n\n\n       Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags are classified properly under subheading 4202.32,\n\nHTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.” Defendant\n\nopposes such classification arguing the plain and unambiguous language of subheading 4202.32,\n\nHTSUS, precludes such classification.\n\n\n\n                       i.     “[I]n the pocket or in the handbag”\n\n       Defendant first argues the language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, specifically “in the\n\npocket or in the handbag,” plainly and unambiguously indicates Congress only meant to include\n\nsmall pocket articles in the provision. Such an interpretation necessarily would exclude the\n\nmerchandise at issue because it can not be carried in a pocket. In support, defendant cites the\n\nexemplars enumerated in the Explanatory Notes as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the\n\npocket or in the handbag” and points out that those articles are capable of being carried in the\n\npocket and in the handbag. Also, Customs cites the drafting history of the HTS to support “the\n\nvalidity of [this] conclusion[].” Universal Transcon. Corp. v. J.E. Bernard & Co., 42 CCPA 69,\n\nCAD 573 (1954). Defendant contends because subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was added\n\npursuant to the suggestion from the United States delegate to the HSC that a subheading be\n\nadded to encompass small pocket articles, the resulting phrase “Articles of a kind normally\n\ncarried in the pocket or in the handbag” should be read only to include small pocket articles.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v.

Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n       The Court agrees with defendant that the language “in the pocket or in the handbag” of\n\nsubheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is plain and unambiguous, however, the Court disagrees with\n\nCustoms’s narrow reading of the phrase. The defendant’s construction of the statute would have\n\nthe court ignore the disjunctive “or” and rob the phrase “in the handbag” of its independent and\n\nordinary significance. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 338 (1979). The Court notes\n\n“[i]n construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.”\n\nId. at 339. Subheading 4202, HTSUS, encompasses articles of a kind normally carried “in the\n\npocket or in the handbag.” “Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a\n\ndisjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise. . . .” Id. The\n\nCourt notes “[w]here the language of a statute demonstrates a clear intent of Congress, that intent\n\nis regarded as conclusive.” Marcor, 926 F. Supp. at 1129. Accordingly, this Court finds articles\n\nnormally carried in a handbag may fall within subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.\n\n\n\n       In this matter, the parties stipulate the cosmetics bags may be “small enough to be housed\n\nwithin a handbag.” (Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts at ¶ 9; Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’\n\nFacts at ¶ 9.) Given the parties’ stipulation and the plain meaning of the phrase “in the pocket or\n\nin the handbag,” the Court finds the merchandise at issue is not precluded from classification\n\nunder subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in\n\nthe handbag.”\n\n\n\n                       ii.    “Articles of a kind normally carried . . .”\n\n       The first part of the statutory phrase used in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                       Page 32\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nkind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,” invokes the concept of use due to its\n\ninclusion of the phrase “of a kind.” See Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States, 15 F. Supp. 2d 915,\n\n917 (CIT 1998) (“The use of the term ‘of a kind’ is nothing more than a statement of the\n\ntraditional standard for classifying [an] importation by []use.”).31 While the Court agrees with\n\nthe parties that subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a use provision, the Court notes subheading\n\n4202.32, HTSUS, addresses use in a particular context which is independent of the purpose for\n\nwhich the merchandise at issue is utilized, i.e., to contain, “organize and segregate cosmetics\n\n[and toiletry products].” (Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts ¶ 10; Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’\n\nFacts ¶ 10 (Admits but avers irrelevant).) Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind\n\nnormally carried in the pocket or in the handbag” addresses the manner in which articles are\n\nemployed or used, i.e., “normally carried,” to serve their intended purpose or use.\n\n\n\n        When use is invoked by the language of the HTSUS, the Court turns to Additional U.S.\n\nRule of Interpretation 1 (USRI 1), which states “a tariff classification controlled by use . . . is to\n\nbe determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date\n\nof importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong, and the\n\ncontrolling use is the principal use.” USRI 1 (emphasis added). In this case, the Court must\n\ndetermine whether the cosmetics bags are of “that class or kind to which the imported goods\n\n        31\n          The Court notes the phrase “of a kind” principally has been interpreted in tariff\nprovisions utilizing the term “use.” See, e.g., Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States, 15 F. Supp. 2d\n915 (CIT 1998) (Interpreting subheading 9405.40.80, HTSUS, “lighting sets of a kind used for\nChristmas trees . . . Other.”). Even so, the Court does not find the lack of the term “use” in\nsubheading 4202.32, HTSUS, a limitation because a designation by use may be established,\nalthough the word “use” or “used” does not appear in the language of the statute. See E.C.\nLineiro v. United States, 37 CCPA 10, 14, CAD 411 (1949).\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 33\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nbelong.” USRI 1; see United States v. Carborundum Co., 536 F.2d 373, 377 (CCPA 1976). To\n\nmake this determination the Court traditionally has used a totality of the circumstances test,\n\nspecifically considering factors such as: the physical characteristics of the merchandise; the\n\nexpectation of ultimate purchasers; the channels of trade; and use. See Carborundum, 536 F.2d\n\nat 377. However, in 1999, the Federal Circuit appears to have renamed the traditional test to\n\ndetermine “class or kind” under USRI 1 under the guise of “commercial fungibility.” Primal\n\nLite, Inc. v. United States, 182 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (“[W]e construe the [HTSUS] to\n\ncall for a determination as to the [class or kind] of goods that are commercially fungible with the\n\nimported goods.”).32\n\n\n\n       In Primal Lite, the Federal Circuit affirmed a lower court ruling which focused on use\n\nbetween the kind or class of merchandise implicated by the HTSUS provision at issue, “lighting\n\nsets of a kind used for Christmas trees,” and the imported merchandise at issue. See Primal Lite,\n\n15 F. Supp. 2d at 917. The “commercial fungibility” to which the Federal Circuit refers appears\n\nto implicate fungibility in terms of the use specified by the tariff provision at issue. Therefore, in\n\norder to find the merchandise at issue classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, it must\n\nhave a use which is fungible with that which defines the class or kind described in the\n\nsubheading, i.e., normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\n\n\n\n       The Court notes subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, does not specify the articles encompassed\n\n\n\n       32\n        The Court notes the test set forth in United States v. Carborundum Co., 536 F.2d 373,\n377 (CCPA 1976) is not refuted in Primal Lite, 182 F.3d at 1365.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v.

Court No. 94-08-00488\n\ntherein; however, the Explanatory Notes33 for Chapter 42 provide “[Subheadings 4202.21,\n\n4202.32 and 4202.29] cover articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\n\nand include spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-folds), wallets, purses, key-cases, cigarette-cases,\n\ncigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches.” The class or kind defined by the subheading\n\nappears to be items which have independent and various functions, albeit normally carried in the\n\npocket or in the handbag.\n\n\n\n       In this matter, the parties stipulate: “[w]omen normally carry some cosmetics with them\n\nso that they can have cosmetics with them on a daily basis;” “[w]omen normally carry a handbag\n\nfor convenience to contain various personal items, including cosmetics, that they want to have\n\nabout their person on a daily basis;” and “[c]osmetic bags are items that are used to carry\n\ncosmetics and [some34 are] small enough to be housed within a handbag.” (Plaintiffs’ Statement\n\n\n       33\n          It has been long settled that “while the Explanatory Notes do not constitute controlling\nlegislative history, they do offer guidance in interpreting HTS subheadings.” Lonza, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 46 F.3d 1098, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995).\n       34\n           The Court notes plaintiffs maintain “[c]osmetic bags are items that are used to carry\ncosmetics and it is small enough to be housed within a handbag.” (Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts\nat ¶ 9.) Defendant responds “[a]dmit[ting] that cosmetics bags are containers that are used to\ncarry cosmetics, aver[ring] that certain cosmetic bags are small enough to be used in conjunction\nwith a handbag for daytime use . . . .” (Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Facts at ¶ 9.) Also,\nplaintiffs aver the cosmetics bags “are of a size to be carried in a handbag” (Plaintiffs’ Statement\nof Facts at ¶ 11), and defendant responds “den[ying] that these articles are all of a size to be\ncarried in a handbag and avers that this denial does not create a genuine issue as to any material\nfact. Further avers that certain of these articles are themselves the size of handbags.”\n(Defendant’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Facts at ¶ 11.) In brief, defendant further states “cosmetic\nbags are certainly carried in the handbag.” (Defendant’s Reply Memorandum in Opposition to\nPlaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 8.) The Court recognizes defendant’s\nstatements as to the size of some of the cosmetics bags at issue are directed to its argument that\nsome of the cosmetics bags may be carried independently of a handbag. The Court notes,\nhowever, such a possibility does not mean such cosmetic bags may not be carried within a\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                      Page 35\nConsol.

In addition, defendant does not appear to specifically\n\nrefute or contest expert testimony presented by plaintiffs that women normally carry cosmetics\n\nbags in their handbags.\n\n       Q. How did that mix of what she had match up to what you would normally [sic] from\n       the rest of your research expect were [sic] the types of things that women will carry\n       around in their handbag?\n\n       A. Well . . . one of the sources that I read and that I quote in the book [Bags, A Lexicon\n       of Style, Valerie Steele & Laird Borrelli, (Scriptum Editions, 1999)] is from Esquire\n       Magazine, which had an article a few years ago called “Your Wife: A User’s Manual, Her\n       Purse” . . . the exact quote . . . “Women carry useful objects, including medication, band-\n       aids, an organizer . . . cosmetics and cosmetic bag[s] . . . .” [O]ne thing that people almost\n       always tend to mention is that they will carry cosmetics and a cosmetics bag . . . .”\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Exhibit P, Deposition of Dr. Valerie Steele at\n\n65-67, 69.) Based on the parties’ stipulations and uncontested expert testimony, the Court finds\n\nthe cosmetics bags at issue may be housed in a handbag and are so normally carried. Therefore,\n\nthe merchandise at issue has a use that is commercially fungible with the class or kind specified\n\nin subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.\n\n\n\n       Defendant argues the merchandise at issue is not commercially fungible with the articles\n\ncovered by subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Defendant maintains plaintiffs have failed to bring\n\nforth evidence of commercial fungibility demonstrating the cosmetics bags are “competitive with\n\nand can replace the articles ‘of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.’”\n\n(Defendant’s Reply Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff’s [sic] Cross-Motion for Partial\n\n\n\nhandbag, and that they are not normally so carried.\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                     Page 36\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\nSummary Judgment at 12.) The Court finds defendant’s analysis, grounded in notions of product\n\nsubstitutability, too narrow given the use provision at issue. As noted above, subheading\n\n4202.32, HTSUS, is not a traditional use provision implicating the use of the merchandise at\n\nissue. Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, addresses the manner in which articles are employed or\n\ntransported. Accordingly, defendant’s interpretation of commercial fungibility is contrary to the\n\nplain meaning of the statute. On its face, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a provision\n\nencompassing various articles which are employed in a similar manner. Restricting classification\n\nin the manner advocated by defendant would narrow the subheading contrary to legislative intent.\n\nMoreover, defendant’s application of fungibility is further refuted by the Explanatory Notes\n\nwhich include a list of “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.”\n\nThis Court notes these exemplars are not directly substitutable, e.g., a wallet for a pipe-case,\n\nalthough they are fungible in the manner in which they are employed, i.e., normally carried in the\n\npocket or in the handbag.\n\n\n\n       For the reasons stated above, the Court finds the merchandise at issue prima facie\n\nclassifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as “Articles of a kind normally carried in the\n\npocket or in the handbag.”\n\n\n\n               c.      Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar\n                       bags . . . Other.”\n\n       Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, “Other . . . Travel, sports and similar bags . . . Other” is\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                        Page 37\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\na residuary or basket provision.35 “Classification of imported merchandise in a basket provision,\n\nhowever, is appropriate only when there is no tariff category that covers the merchandise more\n\nspecifically.” Chevron Chem. Co. v. United States, 59 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1368 (CIT 1999); see\n\nalso E.M. Chems. v. United States, 923 F. Supp. 202, 206 (CIT 1996). Because the Court finds\n\nthe merchandise at issue prima facie classifiable under two alternative subheadings which covers\n\nthe merchandise at issue more specifically, the Court will not address classification under\n\nsubheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS.\n\n\n\n       3.      The Subheading Preferred for Classification\n\n       The Court finds the cosmetics bags at issue prima facie classifiable under subheadings\n\n4202.12, HTUSU, “[V]anity Cases,” and 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind normally carried\n\nin the pocket or in the handbag.” Pursuant to GRI 3(a), when a product is prima facie\n\nclassifiable under two or more subheadings, “[t]he [sub]heading which provides the most\n\nspecific description shall be preferred to [sub]headings providing a more general description.”\n\nGRI 3(a). Therefore, classification of the product turns on which of these two provisions is the\n\nmore specific. See Orlando Food Corp. v. United States, 140 F.3d 1437, 1441 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n\n“Under this so-called rule of relative specificity, [the Court] look[s] to the provision with\n\nrequirements that are more difficult to satisfy and that describe the article with the greatest\n\ndegree of accuracy and certainty.” Id. (citing United States v. Siemens Am., Inc., 653 F.2d 471,\n\n\n\n       35\n          The Court notes the parties agree subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, “Other . . . Travel,\nsports and similar bags . . . Other,” is a residuary provision. (See Memorandum of Law in\nSupport of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 17; Defendant’s Reply\nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 28.)\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v. United States                                    Page 38\nConsol. Court No. 94-08-00488\n\n477 (CCPA 1981); see Carl Zeiss, 195 F.3d at 1380.\n\n\n\n       The Court also recognizes the general rule of Customs jurisprudence that, “‘in the\n\nabsence of legislative intent to the contrary, a product described by both a use provision and an\n\neo nomine provision is generally more specifically provided for under the use provision.’”\n\nOrlando, 140 F.3d at 1441 (quoting Siemens Am., 653 F.2d at 478). However, this Court notes\n\nthis rule is not obligatory and only provides a “‘convenient rule of thumb for resolving issues\n\nwhere the competing provisions are in balance [i.e., equally descriptive].’” Carl Zeiss, 195 F.3d\n\nat 1380 (quoting Siemens Am., 653 F.2d at 478 n.6); see also Totes, Inc. v. United States, 69 F.3d\n\n495, 500 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In this matter, the Court must determine the relative specificity\n\nbetween subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, an eo nomine provision, and subheading 4202.32,\n\nHTSUS, a use provision.\n\n\n\n       Even though the Court recognizes the long standing maxim that a use provision is usually\n\nmore specific than an eo nomine provision, the Court declines to apply it to the instant case\n\nbecause the Court finds the competing subheadings do not “equally describe” the merchandise at\n\nissue. See E.M. Chems. v. United States, 920 F.2d 910, 916 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The Court finds\n\nsubheading 4202.12, HTSUS, “[V]anity cases,” more specifically describes the cosmetics bags at\n\nissue than subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, “Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in\n\nthe handbag.” The Court’s finding is premised on the Court’s understanding that the use\n\nprovision at issue in this case is not one which implicates the primary use of the merchandise at\n\nissue but rather the manner in which it is employed, i.e., normally carried in the pocket or in the\n\fLen-Ron Manufacturing Co., Inc., et al. v.

Unlike subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, which specifies a single article for proper\n\nclassification, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a broad provision encompassing a variety of\n\narticles with specific and independent uses as illustrated by the Explanatory Notes. Because the\n\nsubheadings are not equally specific, the Court will not prefer the use provision over the eo\n\nnomine provision. Therefore, because the Court finds no other subheading more appropriate, the\n\nCourt finds the merchandise at issue are correctly classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS,\n\nas “[V]anity cases.”\n\n\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated above, the Court finds the merchandise at issue classified properly\n\nunder subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as “[V]anity cases . . . With outer surface of plastics,”\n\ndutiable at a rate of 20% ad valorem. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment is denied, and defendant’s Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     _____________________________\n                                                     Gregory W.

CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Plaintiffs</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Part</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs oppose defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction certain entries for which plaintiffs did not protest classification. Plaintiffs argue defendant's motion is premature, irrelevant to the cross-motions for summary judgment before the Court, and the Court should deny the motion with leave for defendant to renew.</p>\n<p>Even though plaintiffs admit no protests regarding classification were filed for the twenty-three entries for which defendant seeks dismissal, plaintiffs contend the Court should proceed to determine the proper classification of the merchandise without dismissing the classification claims with respect to those twenty-three entries. Plaintiffs argue the cross-motions for partial summary judgment before the Court involve a legal question concerning the scope and meaning of three tariff provisions, and the Court's judgment in no way depends upon how many or which entries will be affected. Plaintiffs maintain determination of the entries affected by the Court's judgment is largely a clerical task to be undertaken when the Court's judgment is executed. At that point, plaintiffs propose, defendant should be allowed to renew its motion to dismiss certain entries, or the parties may stipulate to a list of entries to which the judgment applies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs contend no genuine issues of material fact exist, and they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Len-Ron argues Customs improperly classified the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem.</i> Plaintiffs also assert defendant's proposed alternative classification for the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem,</i> is incorrect. Len-Ron contends the merchandise at issue is classified properly under subheading 4202.32.10, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" dutiable at a rate of 12.1¢/kg + 4.6% <i>ad valorem.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</i>\"</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags at issue are normally carried by women in a handbag to hold, segregate and protect cosmetics. A cosmetics bag, plaintiffs argue, is similar to other personal articles, <i>e.g.,</i> wallet, change purse, organizer, women normally carry in their handbags for daily use. Plaintiffs maintain the cosmetics bags at issue are not carried normally as a separate bag or container. Therefore, plaintiffs argue subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" encompasses the merchandise at issue.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue legislative history supports classification of the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Len-Ron contends analysis of the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1272</span> establishes subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as a use provision. Plaintiffs maintain legislative history supports a use-based interpretation of the statute rather than one based solely on the exemplars listed in the statute and Explanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02, HTSUS.<sup>[14]</sup> According to plaintiffs, the Harmonized System Committee (HSC) of the Customs Cooperation Council's use of the phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" instead of the exemplar-based Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUS) provision for \"flat goods,\"<sup>[15]</sup> illustrates the HSC's intention for the subheading to cover a broad base of similar articles characterized by their use as containers for articles carried on the person. Plaintiffs maintain the subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is not limited, by it own terms or by the intent of the drafters, to the specific articles enumerated in heading 4202, <i>i.e.,</i> wallets, purses, map cases, cigarette cases, similar containers, or in the Explanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02, HTSUS, <i>i.e.,</i> \"similar containers\" in second part of heading 4202, HTSUS, as including note-cases, writing cases, pen-cases, ticket-cases, cigar-cases, etc.<sup>[16]</sup> Plaintiffs maintain, the Explanatory Note clearly shows this heading continues to include flat goods; however, unlike the subheading used in the TSUS, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, will be governed by use, not exemplars. Therefore, plaintiffs argue, since the merchandise at issue is to be used or carried within a handbag, it squarely falls under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p>Also, plaintiffs argue, while the exemplars in the statute and Explanatory Notes may not be used as limitations for classification under heading 4202.32, they are relevant for determining the essential characteristics, under the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule of statutory construction,<sup>[17]</sup> of items classifiable within subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Plaintiffs assert the cosmetics bags at issue share the essential characteristics of the exemplars enumerated in the statute and Explanatory Notes. Like the exemplars, the merchandise at issue is small, lightly constructed and designed to be carried in a handbag and is normally so carried. Therefore, the merchandise at issue is properly classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1273</span> b. <i>Improper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.</i>\"</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue is not classifiable under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... With outer surface of sheeting of plastic ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem.</i> First, plaintiffs contend Customs improperly classified the merchandise at issue within a residuary subheading without determining first whether the article was classifiable within any of the other available subheadings. Plaintiffs maintain the merchandise at issue is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Without refutation of this classification, plaintiffs argue, Customs's classification of the cosmetics bags under the residuary subheading in Chapter 42, HTSUS, \"Other\" is improper. Moreover, plaintiffs contend Additional U.S. Note 1 (U.S. Note 1)<sup>[18]</sup> requires Customs to exclude the merchandise at issue from classification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, prior to using subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, \"Other.\"</p>\n<p>Second, plaintiffs contend Customs's classification under subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, \"Other\" is contrary to the classification methodology set forth by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). GRI 6<sup>[19]</sup> instructs comparisons be made only between tariff provisions at the same level of the tariff hierarchy. Len-Ron argues Customs's rationale for classification under subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, is based upon a comparison of two provisions that are not comparable, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" a subheading and \"Travel, sports and similar bags,\" a subordinate division of the subheading \"Other.\" Plaintiffs argue Customs's interpretation and analysis of the merchandise at issue under the HTSUS is erroneous.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs further argue, even if the merchandise at issue is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, and subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, GRI 3(a)<sup>[20]</sup> would mandate classification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, because it offers \"the most specific description\" of the merchandise at issue. Moreover, even if the subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, could be compared with subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" plaintiffs contend, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, would still be the proper classification because the merchandise at issue does not share essential characteristics with the exemplars enumerated under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS. Citing U.S. Note 1 to Chapter 42 of the HTSUS, plaintiffs maintain, unlike travel, sports and similar bags, the merchandise at issue is not designed to carry clothing and other personal effects during travel. Also, plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue is not designed to be carried independently but within another container. Therefore, plaintiffs assert the merchandise at issue may not be properly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1274</span> classified under subheading 4202.92.45, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Improper Classification under Subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.</i>\"</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags may not be classified properly under the <i>eo nomine</i><sup>[21]</sup> tariff term \"[V]anity cases\" in subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>First, plaintiffs contend the term \"[V]anity cases\" is ambiguous and dictionary definitions of the term and expert testimony reveal three distinct forms of the article: a compact, a handbag and a small piece of luggage. Plaintiffs maintain the statute refers to the third definition, a small piece of luggage. Plaintiffs base their argument on the drafting history of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Len-Ron notes the HTS is a multi-national tariff with international nomenclature, and the meaning of a term must be construed in the context of the various languages in which the HTS is written. According to plaintiffs, under the international nomenclature, HTS headings and subheadings should encompass the same items despite language differences. Plaintiffs contend the first part of the heading 4202, <i>i.e.,</i> \"Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases, camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers ...,\" which includes the term \"vanity cases,\" was intended to include items of luggage. Comparing the English and French terminology under heading 4202, HTSUS, plaintiffs maintain the term \"vanity cases\" was intended by the drafters to be equivalent to the French term \"les mallettes de toilettes,\" <i>i.e.,</i> little trunks for toilet articles. According to plaintiffs, the merchandise at issue does not meet this definition.</p>\n<p>In addition, plaintiffs argue, under the rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> the cosmetics bags do not share essential characteristics with the containers listed in the first part of heading 4202 or in subheadings 4202.12, HTSUS, \"Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels and similar containers [<i>e.g.,</i> hat boxes, camera accessory cases, cartridge pouches, sheaths for hunting or camping knives.... <i>See</i> Ch. 42.02, Explanatory Notes].\" Plaintiffs maintain all the exemplars are designed to be carried independently as external bags, unlike the merchandise at issue. Therefore, plaintiffs contend the <i>eo nomine</i> provision of \"vanity cases\" under which defendant would classify the cosmetics bags has been shown by definition, legislative history and similitude to be limited to the type of vanity case that resembles a small suitcase for cosmetics. Therefore, plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue may not be classified properly under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p>For all the reasons cited above, plaintiffs assert the proper classification of the merchandise at issue is under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Defendant</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Part</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to U.S. CIT R. 12(b), defendant, United States, moves to dismiss the twenty-three entries for which classification was not protested. Defendant argues it is fundamental that in order for the Court to have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) over the twenty-three entries at issue in this motion, it was necessary for plaintiffs to have protested Customs's classification for each entry pursuant to 19 U.S.C. §§ 1514 and 1515. The government contends because plaintiffs did not protest the classification of the twenty-three entries it seeks to dismiss, the Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1275</span> may not properly exercise jurisdiction over those entries. Accordingly, defendant moves for dismissal with respect to those twenty-three entries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues there are no issues of material fact, and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Defendant contends the cosmetics bags at issue should be classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases,\" and, in the alternative, under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\" Defendant maintains the cosmetics bags are not classifiable properly under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues the cosmetics bags should be classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, an <i>eo nomine</i> provision for \"vanity cases.\" Finding the term ambiguous, defendant acknowledges the common dictionary meaning of the term \"vanity case\" includes several forms of the article, <i>e.g.,</i> a small luggage bag for holding cosmetics, small container to carry cosmetic accessories. Even so, defendant argues Congress is presumed to know the language of commerce so as to classify commodities according to the general usage and denomination of the trade; therefore, in the absence of legislative intent, an <i>eo nomine</i> provision includes all forms of an article. Defendant contends the merchandise at issue fits squarely within the common meaning of the term \"vanity cases\" as used in the HTSUS. Defendant asserts a vanity case is a small handbag or case for carrying cosmetics. Customs notes plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as cosmetics cases, defined as a small piece of luggage for cosmetics. Based on the similarity of their definitions, defendant argues a cosmetic case is a vanity case. Therefore, the merchandise at issue may be classified properly under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p>Defendant also argues plaintiffs may not argue under the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> to refute classification of the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS. Defendant contends since the merchandise at issue falls squarely within the common meaning of the term \"[V]anity case[]\" in the subheading, <i>ejusdem generis</i> may not be used to restrict the scope of the provision. Defendant contends the common meaning of the term \"vanity case\" is clear. Therefore, rules of construction such as <i>ejusdem generis</i> may not be used to narrow the term's common meaning.</p>\n<p>Even so, defendant contends, if the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> applies and the term \"vanity cases,\" in fact, only applies to luggage, the cosmetics bags would still be classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"similar containers.\" Defendant argues all the articles enumerated in subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, are traveling bags used to carry different types of articles. Since the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> requires only that the merchandise possess the essential character running through all enumerated exemplars, defendant maintains the merchandise at issue is <i>ejusdem generis</i> because it is a travel bag used to carry cosmetics. Defendant contends plaintiffs' argument using <i>ejusdem generis</i> has no merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, Customs argues the cosmetics bags were classified properly upon entry under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\" Defendant maintains, contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, it classified the merchandise under the residuary subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, by relying upon the plain meaning of the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1276</span> and not upon a comparison between subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" and subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, \"Other.\" According to Customs, the cosmetics bags are not classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS; therefore, Customs's choice of the residuary subheading was appropriate.</p>\n<p>According to Customs, the cosmetics bags fall under the statutory definition of \"[t]ravel, sports and similar bags\" as provided by Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, HTSUS, \"goods ... of a kind designed for carrying clothing and other personal effects during travel.\" Defendant argues plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as travel bags, cases and pouches in marketing and advertising literature and, according to plaintiffs, the merchandise is designed to carry personal effects such as cosmetics. Accordingly, contends defendant, the cosmetics bags meet the statutory definition of \"Travel, sports and similar bags\" and therefore, it was classified properly under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Improper Classification under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Customs argues the language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is plain and unambiguous, and the merchandise at issue may not be classified properly under the subheading. Customs contends the statutory phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" was intended by Congress to refer only to small pocket articles. To bolster its argument, Customs cites the exemplars enumerated in the Explanatory Notes as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" <i>i.e.,</i> spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-folds), wallets, purses, key-cases, cigarette-cases, cigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches. Defendant claims the fact all these items may be carried in the pocket as well as in the handbag illustrates subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was only meant to include items which are capable of being carried in a pocket. Therefore, argues Customs, this size limitation precludes classification of the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, because the cosmetics bags are not small pocket articles.</p>\n<p>In addition, defendant uses HTS drafting history to support the validity of its conclusion that the plain meaning of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, only implicates small pocket articles. Customs argues, in 1978, the United States Administration proposed to the HSC an additional subheading for \"flat goods\" in heading 4202 which the United States' delegate explained was intended to give separate status to small pocket articles. According to defendant, the HSC agreed with the United States about the need for an additional subheading but in lieu of the phrase \"flat goods\" chose the phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" Defendant contends the phrase used in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was borrowed from Chapter 71 of the HTSUS and its Explanatory Notes classifying articles of jewelry, all of which may be carried in the pocket.<sup>[22]</sup> Also, defendant notes similar language was in use in the TSUS to define articles of jewelry, and a variation of this language was used to define \"flat goods.\" Defendant contends since the HSC essentially adopted the United States \"flat goods\" proposal in the Explanatory Notes, although under a different title, and since, according to the U.S. delegate, the \"flat goods\" provision was intended to include only small pocket articles, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" was intended only to cover small pocket articles.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1277</span> In addition, defendant contends when Congress recast the TSUS \"flat goods\" provision in the Explanatory Notes, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" it removed the term \"vanity cases\" from the exemplars that had been enumerated in the TSUS provision. According to Customs, the regrouping of \"vanity cases\" in an alternative subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, limited the scope of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, to small pocket articles. By changing the language of the recast flat goods provision to include only articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag and providing for vanity cases in a separate provision, Congress manifested an obvious intent to treat vanity cases separately and distinctly from those articles with which they had been grouped under the TSUS. Therefore, the merchandise at issue is not classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p>Customs also argues plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the cosmetics bags are \"of a kind\" normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag as required by the plain meaning of the statute. Customs notes classification within headings and subheadings using the phrase \"of a kind\" is controlled by use. Pursuant to the instruction of Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS,<sup>[23]</sup> defendant contends the cosmetics bags are not of the \"class or kind\" of goods described in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" because the merchandise at issue is not commercially fungible<sup>[24]</sup> with those items which define the class or kind of articles covered by subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. According to defendant, plaintiffs have produced no evidence of commercial fungibility. Defendant maintains, under the plain meaning subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, the cosmetics bags may not be classified properly as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, defendant argues the proper classification for the merchandise at issue is subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. MOTION TO DISMISS IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION</h2>\n<p>When a defendant challenges the Court's jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction exists. <i>See </i><i>Lowa, Ltd. v. United States,</i> 561 F.Supp. 441, 443 (CIT 1983).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a), this Court has \"exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced to contest the denial of a protest, in whole or in part, under section 515 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [the Act].\" Codified at 19 U.S.C. § 1515(a) (1994), section 515(a) of the Act provides, \"the appropriate customs officer, within two years from the date a protest was filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title, shall review the protest and shall allow or deny such protest in whole or in part.\" Section 1514(a) states decisions of the Customs Service including \"the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable ... shall be final and conclusive upon all persons ... unless a protest is filed in accordance with this section.\" 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs do not dispute their failure to file protests regarding the classification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1278</span> of the twenty-three entries at issue in defendant's motion to dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, because no protests were filed, the classification of the twenty-three entries at issue is final and conclusive. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ataka Am., Inc.,</i> 826 F.Supp. 495, 502 (CIT 1993) (\"Failure to protest [classification] results in the finality of the decision.\"). Accordingly, the Court finds it lacks jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) over those non-protested entries and grants defendant's motion dismissing the twenty-three entries at issue with respect to the classification cause of action. <i>See </i><i>Computime, Inc. v. United States,</i> 601 F.Supp. 1029, 1031 (CIT 1984). This Court makes no determination as to how the twenty-three entries may be considered in the appraisement cause of action.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CROSS-MOTIONS FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This case is before the Court on plaintiffs' motion and defendant's cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Under U.S. CIT R. 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate if, based on the papers before the Court, \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\" and \"the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" When deciding summary judgment motions in classification cases, the Court must first ascertain the proper meaning of the specific terms in the tariff provision, a question of law, and second determine whether the merchandise at issue comes within the description of such terms as properly construed, a question of fact. <i>See </i><i>SGI, Inc. v. United States,</i> 122 F.3d 1468, 1471 (Fed.Cir.1997). The parties claim there are no genuine issues as to any material facts; therefore partial summary judgment is appropriate in this matter. This Court agrees.</p>\n<p>The sole issue before the Court is a question of law<sup>[26]</sup> pertaining to the proper interpretation of pertinent sections of the HTSUS. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Rollerblade, Inc. v. United States,</i> 112 F.3d 481, 483 (Fed. Cir.1997)). The Court will conduct a <i>de novo</i> review of this matter based on the record before it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2640(a)(1) (1994).<sup>[27]</sup><i>See </i><i>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. United States,</i> 981 F.Supp. 654, 658 (CIT 1997). In making its determination as to the proper classification under the HTSUS, the Court must consider whether \"the government's classification is correct, both independently and in comparison with the importer's alternative.\" <i>Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States,</i> 733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Classification Under the HTSUS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The proper classification of merchandise entering the United States is directed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI) of the HTSUS and the Additional United States Rules of Interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Orlando Food Corp. v. United States,</i> 140 F.3d 1437, 1439 (Fed.Cir.1998). The HTSUS scheme is organized by headings; each of which has one or more subheadings providing a more particularized segregation of the heading at issue. <i>See id.</i> Under the GRI, the Court must first construe the language of the heading and any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1279</span> section or chapter notes in question to determine whether the product at issue is classifiable under the heading. Only then may the Court look to the subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise at issue. <i>See id.</i> at 1440; GRI 1, 6.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p>\"As with other statutory provisions, it is the function of the court to interpret the tariff acts in a manner that will fulfill or carry out the intent of Congress.\" <i>Meco Elec. Prods. v. United States,</i> 14 CIT 181, 183 (1990). To ascertain Congress' intent, the Court first looks to the plain meaning of the statutory text. <i>See </i><i>Marcor Dev. Corp. v. United States,</i> 926 F.Supp. 1124, 1129 (CIT 1996) (citing <i>Trans-Border Customs Servs. v. United States,</i> 843 F.Supp. 1482, 1485 (CIT 1994)). If the plain language of the statute demonstrates the clear and unambiguous intent of Congress, the Court's inquiry is complete. <i>See id.</i> However, absent any contrary indication of Congressional intent from the statute or legislative history, tariff terms are construed in accordance with their common and popular meaning. <i>See </i><i>Lynteq, Inc. v. United States,</i> 976 F.2d 693, 697 (Fed.Cir.1992). In construing such terms, the Court may \"`rely upon its own understanding, dictionaries and other reliable sources.'\" <i>North Am. Processing Co. v. United States,</i> 56 F.Supp.2d 1174, 1179 (CIT 1999) (quoting <i>Medline Indus., Inc. v. United States,</i> 62 F.3d 1407, 1409 (Fed.Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Heading 4202, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases ... similar containers ... traveling bags, toiletry bags ... purses ... similar containers....\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In this matter, the parties' arguments principally address the proper subheading classification within heading 4202, HTSUS, for the merchandise at issue. The parties appear to agree the cosmetics bags are properly classified under heading 4202, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases ... and similar containers; ... traveling bags, toiletry bags ... purses ... and similar containers....\" Even so, pursuant to <i>Jarvis Clark,</i> 733 F.2d at 878, the Court must consider whether classification of the merchandise at issue is, in fact, appropriate under heading 4202, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>Heading 4202, HTSUS, is comprised of a list of exemplars some of which arguably describe the merchandise at issue in this matter. Defendant argues the merchandise at issue may be considered as \"vanity cases,\" \"traveling bags,\" \"toiletry bags,\" or \"similar containers.\" Plaintiffs appear to argue the merchandise at issue, which they refer to as cosmetics bags, may be considered as \"similar containers\" in the second part of heading 4202, HTSUS. (<i>See</i> Defendant's Motion at 7, 16; Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' for Partial Summary Judgment (Plaintiffs' Motion) at 17.) Because the Court finds the language of heading 4202, HTSUS, is unclear and legislative history provides this Court with no clarification as to those exemplars or phrases in heading 4202, HTSUS, under which the merchandise at issue may be classified properly, the Court will use the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> to ascertain whether the merchandise at issue may be classified properly under heading 4202, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>In applying the rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> the Court must consider whether the merchandise at issue possesses the essential characteristics or purposes that unite the listed examples preceding the general term or phrase in the statute. <i>See </i><i>Avenues in Leather, Inc. v. United States,</i> 178 F.3d 1241, 1244 (Fed.Cir.1999). It is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1280</span> well-established that the essential characteristic and purposes of the heading 4202, HTSUS, exemplars is \"to organize, store, protect and carry various items.\" <i>SGI, Inc.,</i> 122 F.3d at 1471; <i>Totes, Inc. v. United States,</i> 865 F.Supp. 867, 872 (CIT 1994). In this matter, the parties stipulate the cosmetics bags are used to contain, \"organize and segregate cosmetics [and toiletry products.]\" (Plaintiffs' Statement Under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts as to Which There is No Dispute (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts) at ¶ 10; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Statement under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts As to Which There is No Dispute (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts) at ¶ 10 (Admits but avers irrelevant).) Due to the breadth of exemplars listed in heading 4202, HTSUS, the exemplars' essential characteristics and purpose, the parties' stipulation, and the Court's inability to find any other appropriate heading, the Court finds the merchandise at issue properly classified under heading 4202, HTSUS, because it is used to organize personal items, <i>i.e.,</i> cosmetics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Proposed Subheading Classifications within Heading 4202, HTSUS.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In this matter, the parties advance three subheadings within heading 4202, HTSUS, as possible classifications for the merchandise at issue: subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases;\" subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag;\" subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Merchandise at Issue Prima Facie Classifiable under Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues the cosmetics bags are properly classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\" Plaintiffs oppose this classification. This Court agrees with defendant that the merchandise at issue is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases\" is an <i>eo nomine</i> tariff designation.<sup>[29]</sup> Even so, the Court finds the term is not clearly defined by the headings, subheadings, or chapter notes of Chapter 42, HTSUS. In addition, the Court finds Congress did not specify its intent as to the term \"vanity cases.\" <i>See</i> subheading 4202.12, HTSUS. Thus, the Court must determine the common meaning of the term \"[V]anity case\" as used in the statute. <i>See </i><i>North Am.,</i> 56 F.Supp.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p>Various definitions of the term \"vanity case\" are advanced by \"dictionaries and other reliable sources\" to which the Court looks to discern a tariff term's common meaning. <i>Id.</i> at 1179. The OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 430 (2d. ed.1989) defines \"vanity case\" as \"a small hand-bag, etc., for ladies, fitted with a mirror and powder-puff.\" According to the AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 1944 (3rd ed.1996), a \"vanity case\" is \"1. [a] small handbag or case used by women for carrying cosmetics or toiletries. 2. a woman's compact.\" The RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1580 (1966) defines the term as \"a small luggage bag or case for holding cosmetics or toiletries used or carried by women.\" The Court notes the common meaning of the term \"vanity case\" appears to include various forms of the article: a compact; a small handbag or case used by women for carrying cosmetics; and a small luggage bag for cosmetics.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the term \"[V]anity case[]\" as used in heading 4202, HTSUS, and subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, only refers to a small piece of luggage for cosmetics. Plaintiffs base their argument on the Session Notes of the Harmonized System Committee (HSC) of the Customs Cooperation Council and its working party. Comparing terminology in the French and English versions of the HTS, plaintiffs maintain, the term \"[V]anity cases,\" as used in the HTSUS, was intended to be the equivalent of the French term \"les mallettes de toillettes,\" <i>i.e.,</i> little trunk for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1281</span> toilet articles. The Court finds plaintiffs' argument unpersuasive.<sup>[30]</sup></p>\n<p>\"Congress is presumed to know the language of commerce, and to have framed tariff acts so as to classify commodities according to the general usage and denomination of the trade.\" <i>John v. Carr &amp; Son, Inc. v. United States,</i> 77 Cust. Ct. 103, 107 (1976). Therefore, because Congress used the term \"vanity cases\" within the statute without limitation as to form, it may be presumed all forms of the articles are meant by Congress to be included therein. \"`[A]n eo nomine designation, with no terms of limitation, will ordinarily include all forms of the named article.'\" <i>Carl Zeiss,</i> 195 F.3d at 1379 (quoting <i>Hayes-Sammons Chem. Co. v. United States,</i> 55 C.C.P.A. 69, 75 (1968)). Because the Court finds the common meaning of the term \"vanity case[]\" includes a small handbag or case used to hold cosmetics, the Court finds the merchandise at issue in this matter, described by the parties as cosmetics bags used to contain cosmetics, <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Merchandise at Issue Prima Facie Classifiable under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags are classified properly under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" Defendant opposes such classification arguing the plain and unambiguous language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, precludes such classification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. <i>\"[I]n the pocket or in the handbag\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant first argues the language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, specifically \"in the pocket or in the handbag,\" plainly and unambiguously indicates Congress only meant to include small pocket articles in the provision. Such an interpretation necessarily would exclude the merchandise at issue because it can not be carried in a pocket. In support, defendant cites the exemplars enumerated in the Explanatory Notes as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" and points out that those articles are capable of being carried in the pocket <i>and</i> in the handbag. Also, Customs cites the drafting history of the HTS to support \"the validity of [this] conclusion[].\" <i>Universal Transcon. Corp. v. J.E. Bernard &amp; Co.,</i> 42 C.C.P.A. 69, C.A.D. 573 (1954). Defendant contends because subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was added pursuant to the suggestion from the United States delegate to the HSC that a subheading be added to encompass small pocket articles, the resulting phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" should be read only to include small pocket articles.</p>\n<p>The Court agrees with defendant that the language \"in the pocket or in the handbag\" of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is plain and unambiguous, however, the Court disagrees with Customs's narrow reading of the phrase. The defendant's construction of the statute would have the court ignore the disjunctive \"or\" and rob the phrase \"in the handbag\" of its independent and ordinary significance. <i>See </i><i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> 442 U.S. 330, 338, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979). The Court notes \"[i]n construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\" <i>Id.</i> at 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326. Subheading 4202, HTSUS, encompasses articles of a kind normally carried <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1282</span> \"in the pocket or in the handbag.\" \"Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise....\" <i>Id.</i> The Court notes \"[w]here the language of a statute demonstrates a clear intent of Congress, that intent is regarded as conclusive.\" <i>Marcor,</i> 926 F.Supp. at 1129. Accordingly, this Court finds articles normally carried in a handbag may fall within subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>In this matter, the parties stipulate the cosmetics bags may be \"small enough to be housed within a handbag.\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 9; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶ 9.) Given the parties' stipulation and the plain meaning of the phrase \"in the pocket or in the handbag,\" the Court finds the merchandise at issue is not precluded from classification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. <i>\"Articles of a kind normally carried</i> ...\"</h2>\n<p>The first part of the statutory phrase used in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" invokes the concept of use due to its inclusion of the phrase \"of a kind.\" <i>See </i><i>Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States,</i> 15 F.Supp.2d 915, 917 (CIT 1998) (\"The use of the term `of a kind' is nothing more than a statement of the traditional standard for classifying [an] importation by []use.\").<sup>[31]</sup> While the Court agrees with the parties that subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a use provision, the Court notes subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, addresses use in a particular context which is independent of the purpose for which the merchandise at issue is utilized, <i>i.e.,</i> to contain, \"organize and segregate cosmetics [and toiletry products].\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts ¶ 10; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts ¶ 10 (Admits but avers irrelevant).) Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" addresses the manner in which articles are employed or used, <i>i.e.,</i> \"normally carried,\" to serve their intended purpose or use.</p>\n<p>When use is invoked by the language of the HTSUS, the Court turns to Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1 (USRI 1), which states \"a tariff classification controlled by use ... is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that <i>class or kind</i> to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use.\" USRI 1 (emphasis added). In this case, the Court must determine whether the cosmetics bags are of \"that class or kind to which the imported goods belong.\" USRI 1; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Carborundum Co.,</i> 63 C.C.P.A. 98, 536 F.2d 373, 377 (CCPA 1976). To make this determination the Court traditionally has used a totality of the circumstances test, specifically considering factors such as: the physical characteristics of the merchandise; the expectation of ultimate purchasers; the channels of trade; and use. <i>See </i><i>Carborundum,</i> 536 F.2d at 377. However, in 1999, the Federal Circuit appears to have renamed the traditional test to determine \"class or kind\" under USRI 1 under the guise of \"commercial fungibility.\" <i>Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States,</i> 182 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\"[W]e construe the [HTSUS] to call for a determination as to the [class or kind] of goods that are commercially fungible with the imported goods.\").<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1283</span> In <i>Primal Lite,</i> the Federal Circuit affirmed a lower court ruling which focused on use between the kind or class of merchandise implicated by the HTSUS provision at issue, \"lighting sets of a kind used for Christmas trees,\" and the imported merchandise at issue. <i>See </i><i>Primal Lite,</i> 15 F.Supp.2d at 917. The \"commercial fungibility\" to which the Federal Circuit refers appears to implicate fungibility in terms of the use specified by the tariff provision at issue. Therefore, in order to find the merchandise at issue classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, it must have a use which is fungible with that which defines the class or kind described in the subheading, <i>i.e.,</i> normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</p>\n<p>The Court notes subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, does not specify the articles encompassed therein; however, the Explanatory Notes<sup>[33]</sup> for Chapter 42 provide \"[Subheadings 4202.21, 4202.32 and 4202.29] cover articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag and include spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-folds), wallets, purses, key-cases, cigarette-cases, cigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches.\" The class or kind defined by the subheading appears to be items which have independent and various functions, albeit normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</p>\n<p>In this matter, the parties stipulate: \"[w]omen normally carry some cosmetics with them so that they can have cosmetics with them on a daily basis;\" \"[w]omen normally carry a handbag for convenience to contain various personal items, including cosmetics, that they want to have about their person on a daily basis;\" and \"[c]osmetic bags are items that are used to carry cosmetics and [some<sup>[34]</sup> are] small enough to be housed within a handbag.\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶¶ 7, 8, 9; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶¶ 7, 8, 9 (Averring cosmetic bags large enough for nighttime use.).) In addition, defendant does not appear to specifically refute or contest expert testimony presented by plaintiffs that women normally carry cosmetics bags in their handbags.</p>\n<blockquote>Q. How did that mix of what she had match up to what you would normally [sic] from the rest of your research expect were [sic] the types of things that women will carry around in their handbag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well ... one of the sources that I read and that I quote in the book [<i>Bags, A Lexicon of Style,</i> Valerie Steele &amp; Laird Borrelli, (Scriptum Editions, 1999)] is from Esquire Magazine, which had an article a few years ago called \"Your Wife: A User's Manual, Her Purse\" ... the exact quote ... \"Women <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1284</span> carry useful objects, including medication, band-aids, an organizer ... cosmetics and cosmetic bag[s].... [O]ne thing that people almost always tend to mention is that they will carry cosmetics and a cosmetics bag....\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Exhibit P, Deposition of Dr. Valerie Steele at 65-67, 69.) Based on the parties' stipulations and uncontested expert testimony, the Court finds the cosmetics bags at issue may be housed in a handbag and are so normally carried. Therefore, the merchandise at issue has a use that is commercially fungible with the class or kind specified in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>Defendant argues the merchandise at issue is not commercially fungible with the articles covered by subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Defendant maintains plaintiffs have failed to bring forth evidence of commercial fungibility demonstrating the cosmetics bags are \"competitive with and can replace the articles `of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.'\" (Defendant's Reply Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's [sic] Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 12.) The Court finds defendant's analysis, grounded in notions of product substitutability, too narrow given the use provision at issue. As noted above, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is not a traditional use provision implicating the use of the merchandise at issue. Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, addresses the manner in which articles are employed or transported. Accordingly, defendant's interpretation of commercial fungibility is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. On its face, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a provision encompassing various articles which are employed in a similar manner. Restricting classification in the manner advocated by defendant would narrow the subheading contrary to legislative intent. Moreover, defendant's application of fungibility is further refuted by the Explanatory Notes which include a list of \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" This Court notes these exemplars are not directly substitutable, <i>e.g.,</i> a wallet for a pipe-case, although they are fungible in the manner in which they are employed, <i>i.e.,</i> normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the Court finds the merchandise at issue <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other\" is a residuary or basket provision.<sup>[35]</sup> \"Classification of imported merchandise in a basket provision, however, is appropriate only when there is no tariff category that covers the merchandise more specifically.\" <i>Chevron Chem. Co. v. United States,</i> 59 F.Supp.2d 1361, 1368 (CIT 1999); <i>see also </i><i>E.M. Chems. v. United States,</i> 923 F.Supp. 202, 206 (CIT 1996). Because the Court finds the merchandise at issue <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under two alternative subheadings which covers the merchandise at issue more specifically, the Court will not address classification under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Subheading Preferred for Classification</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Court finds the cosmetics bags at issue <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheadings 4202.12, HTUSU, \"[V]anity Cases,\" and 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" Pursuant to GRI <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1285</span> 3(a), when a product is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under two or more subheadings, \"[t]he [sub]heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to [sub]headings providing a more general description.\" GRI 3(a). Therefore, classification of the product turns on which of these two provisions is the more specific. <i>See </i><i>Orlando Food Corp. v. United States,</i> 140 F.3d 1437, 1441 (Fed.Cir. 1998). \"Under this so-called rule of relative specificity, [the Court] look[s] to the provision with requirements that are more difficult to satisfy and that describe the article with the greatest degree of accuracy and certainty.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Siemens Am., Inc.,</i> 68 C.C.P.A. 62, 653 F.2d 471, 477 (CCPA 1981);) <i>see </i><i>Carl Zeiss,</i> 195 F.3d at 1380.</p>\n<p>The Court also recognizes the general rule of Customs jurisprudence that, \"`in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, a product described by both a use provision and an eo nomine provision is generally more specifically provided for under the use provision.'\" <i>Orlando,</i> 140 F.3d at 1441 (quoting <i>Siemens Am.,</i> 653 F.2d at 478). However, this Court notes this rule is not obligatory and only provides a \"`convenient rule of thumb for resolving issues where the competing provisions are in balance [<i>i.e.,</i> equally descriptive].'\" <i>Carl Zeiss,</i> 195 F.3d at 1380 (quoting <i>Siemens Am.,</i> 653 F.2d at 478 n. 6); <i>see also </i><i>Totes, Inc. v. United States,</i> 69 F.3d 495, 500 (Fed.Cir.1995). In this matter, the Court must determine the relative specificity between subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, an <i>eo nomine</i> provision, and subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, a use provision.</p>\n<p>Even though the Court recognizes the long standing maxim that a use provision is usually more specific than an <i>eo nomine</i> provision, the Court declines to apply it to the instant case because the Court finds the competing subheadings do not \"equally describe\" the merchandise at issue. <i>See </i><i>E.M. Chems. v. United States,</i> 920 F.2d 910, 916 (Fed.Cir.1990). The court finds subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases,\" more specifically describes the cosmetics bags at issue than subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" The Court's finding is premised on the Court's understanding that the use provision at issue in this case is not one which implicates the primary use of the merchandise at issue but rather the manner in which it is employed, <i>i.e.,</i> normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag. Unlike subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, which specifies a single article for proper classification, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a broad provision encompassing a variety of articles with specific and independent uses as illustrated by the Explanatory Notes. Because the subheadings are not equally specific, the Court will not prefer the use provision over the <i>eo nomine</i> provision. Therefore, because the Court finds no other subheading more appropriate, the Court finds the merchandise at issue are correctly classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the Court finds the merchandise at issue classified properly under subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases ...

The Court finds the terms to be synonymous.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Court notes all the proposed classifications at issue in this matter may require the merchandise at issue to have a plastic component in order for classification to be proper. <i>See</i> heading 4202, HTSUS (\"[O]f sheeting of plastics\"); subheading 4202.12.20 (\"With outer surface of plastics\"), subheading 4202.32.10 (\"With outer surface of sheeting of plastic ... Of reinforced or laminated plastics\"), subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS (\"With outer surface of sheeting of plastic\"). Because this element of classification has been stipulated to by the parties and the Court finds its understanding of the tariff phrase comports with that stipulation, the Court, in its discussion, will refer only to the contested subheadings and phrases, namely subheadings 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases,\" 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or the handbag,\" and 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ...

United States,</i> 112 F.3d 488, 492 (Fed.Cir. 1997)).</p>\n<p>[27]  In this case, Customs has not promulgated any regulations interpreting the relevant headings or subheadings; therefore, the Court will conduct <i>de novo</i> review based on the record before it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2640(a)(1) (1994). <i>See </i><i>Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States,</i> 195 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir. 1999) (citing <i>Mead Corp. v. United States,</i> 185 F.3d 1304, 1307 (Fed.Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>[28]  General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 1 states, in pertinent part, \"[C]lassification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes....\"\n</p>\n<p>GRI 6 states:</p>\n<p>For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable.</p>\n<p>[29]  <i>See supra</i> note 21.</p>\n<p>[30]  Both parties support their arguments by citing to the Session Notes of the Customs Cooperation Council's Harmonized System Committee and its Working Party. The Court notes, however, working documents, such as commentary by delegations on questions before Harmonized System Committee which are designed to frame issues for discussion, carry virtually no weight in interpreting the Harmonized System even though they may contain more detailed descriptions of the goods under consideration and the rationale for certain positions. <i>See</i> STRUM, R., CUSTOMS LAW &amp; ADMINISTRATION, § 50.2, 17 (Supp.1999).</p>\n<p>[31]  The Court notes the phrase \"of a kind\" principally has been interpreted in tariff provisions utilizing the term \"use.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States,</i> 15 F.Supp.2d 915 (CIT 1998) (Interpreting subheading 9405.40.80, HTSUS, \"lighting sets of a kind used for Christmas trees ... Other.\"). Even so, the Court does not find the lack of the term \"use\" in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, a limitation because a designation by use may be established, although the word \"use\" or \"used\" does not appear in the language of the statute. <i>See </i><i>Lineiro v. United States,</i> 37 C.C.P.A. 10, 14, C.A.D. 411 (1949).</p>\n<p>[32]  The Court notes the test set forth in <i>United States v. Carborundum Co.,</i> 63 C.C.P.A. 98, 536 F.2d 373, 377 (CCPA 1976) is not refuted in <i>Primal Lite,</i> 182 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p>[33]  It has been long settled that \"while the Explanatory Notes do not constitute controlling legislative history, they do offer guidance in interpreting HTS subheadings.\" <i>Lonza, Inc. v. United States,</i> 46 F.3d 1098, 1109 (Fed. Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[34]  The Court notes plaintiffs maintain \"[c]osmetic bags are items that are used to carry cosmetics and it is small enough to be housed within a handbag.\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 9.) Defendant responds \"[a]dmit[ting] that cosmetics bags are containers that are used to carry cosmetics, aver[ring] that certain cosmetic bags are small enough to be used in conjunction with a handbag for daytime use....\" (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶ 9.) Also, plaintiffs aver the cosmetics bags \"are of a size to be carried in a handbag\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 11), and defendant responds \"den[ying] that these articles are all of a size to be carried in a handbag and avers that this denial does not create a genuine issue as to any material fact. Further avers that certain of these articles are themselves the size of handbags.\" (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶ 11.) In brief, defendant further states \"cosmetic bags are certainly carried in the handbag.\" (Defendant's Reply Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 8.) The Court recognizes defendant's statements as to the size of some of the cosmetics bags at issue are directed to its argument that some of the cosmetics bags may be carried independently of a handbag. The Court notes, however, such a possibility does not mean such cosmetic bags may not be carried within a handbag, and that they are not normally so carried.</p>\n<p>[35]  The Court notes the parties agree subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" is a residuary provision.

Of reinforced or laminated plastics,\" dutiable at a rate of 12.1¢/kg + 4.6% <i>ad valorem.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Defendant, United States, opposes plaintiffs' motion. Pursuant to U.S. CIT R. 12(b)(1), defendant moves to dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a)(1994) those entries included in the Summons and Complaint whose classification was not protested by plaintiffs pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1514 (1994).<sup>[5]</sup> Defendant, also, cross-moves for partial summary judgment pursuant to U.S. CIT R. 56(b),<sup>[6]</sup> contending it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the merchandise is classifiable properly under subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases ... With outer surface of plastics,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem</i><sup>[7]</sup> and, in the alternative, under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS. Plaintiffs oppose defendant's motions. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a)(1994).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs are manufacturers and distributors of cosmetics. The complaints in this consolidated action<sup>[8]</sup> raise two independent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1270</span> causes of action. The first cause of action contests Customs's classification of the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... With outer surface of sheeting of plastic ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem.</i> The second cause of action contests Customs's appraisement decisions with regard to certain entries. Of the entries at issue in this action, plaintiffs contest the classification of thirty-nine entries. However, there are twenty-three other entries in which plaintiffs only contest the appraisement decisions made by Customs.<sup>[9]</sup> Those twenty-three entries are not reached by this opinion.</p>\n<p>The merchandise at issue consists of variously shaped cosmetics bags,<sup>[10]</sup> articles of which have been invoiced by plaintiffs as \"rectangular bag, halfmoon bag, fabric bag, travel bag, PVC sponge bag, reusable bag, cosmetic case, cosmetic bag, GWP sunnysider, hatbox U.S.A. bag, new stone open bag, horizontal tote, fabric mirror pouch, nylon cosmetic bag, generic bag, nylon drawstring bag, and cosmetic pouch.\" (Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Part and Defendant's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Defendant's Motion) at 1-2.) Made with an outer surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and an inner lining of polyvinyl sheathing,<sup>[11]</sup> the cosmetics bags are supple, non-rigid and not supported by frames.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs import the merchandise at issue for use as promotional items to be presented to customers upon the purchase of a certain amount of plaintiffs' cosmetic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1271</span> and toiletry products, either as a free premium or at a nominal additional cost. Articles of merchandise are used to contain, organize and segregate cosmetic and toiletry products and some are small enough to be housed<sup>[12]</sup> within a handbag.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Plaintiffs</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Part</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs oppose defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction certain entries for which plaintiffs did not protest classification. Plaintiffs argue defendant's motion is premature, irrelevant to the cross-motions for summary judgment before the Court, and the Court should deny the motion with leave for defendant to renew.</p>\n<p>Even though plaintiffs admit no protests regarding classification were filed for the twenty-three entries for which defendant seeks dismissal, plaintiffs contend the Court should proceed to determine the proper classification of the merchandise without dismissing the classification claims with respect to those twenty-three entries. Plaintiffs argue the cross-motions for partial summary judgment before the Court involve a legal question concerning the scope and meaning of three tariff provisions, and the Court's judgment in no way depends upon how many or which entries will be affected. Plaintiffs maintain determination of the entries affected by the Court's judgment is largely a clerical task to be undertaken when the Court's judgment is executed. At that point, plaintiffs propose, defendant should be allowed to renew its motion to dismiss certain entries, or the parties may stipulate to a list of entries to which the judgment applies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs contend no genuine issues of material fact exist, and they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Len-Ron argues Customs improperly classified the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem.</i> Plaintiffs also assert defendant's proposed alternative classification for the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem,</i> is incorrect. Len-Ron contends the merchandise at issue is classified properly under subheading 4202.32.10, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" dutiable at a rate of 12.1¢/kg + 4.6% <i>ad valorem.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</i>\"</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags at issue are normally carried by women in a handbag to hold, segregate and protect cosmetics. A cosmetics bag, plaintiffs argue, is similar to other personal articles, <i>e.g.,</i> wallet, change purse, organizer, women normally carry in their handbags for daily use. Plaintiffs maintain the cosmetics bags at issue are not carried normally as a separate bag or container. Therefore, plaintiffs argue subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" encompasses the merchandise at issue.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue legislative history supports classification of the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Len-Ron contends analysis of the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1272</span> establishes subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as a use provision. Plaintiffs maintain legislative history supports a use-based interpretation of the statute rather than one based solely on the exemplars listed in the statute and Explanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02, HTSUS.<sup>[14]</sup> According to plaintiffs, the Harmonized System Committee (HSC) of the Customs Cooperation Council's use of the phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" instead of the exemplar-based Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUS) provision for \"flat goods,\"<sup>[15]</sup> illustrates the HSC's intention for the subheading to cover a broad base of similar articles characterized by their use as containers for articles carried on the person. Plaintiffs maintain the subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is not limited, by it own terms or by the intent of the drafters, to the specific articles enumerated in heading 4202, <i>i.e.,</i> wallets, purses, map cases, cigarette cases, similar containers, or in the Explanatory Notes for Chapter 42.02, HTSUS, <i>i.e.,</i> \"similar containers\" in second part of heading 4202, HTSUS, as including note-cases, writing cases, pen-cases, ticket-cases, cigar-cases, etc.<sup>[16]</sup> Plaintiffs maintain, the Explanatory Note clearly shows this heading continues to include flat goods; however, unlike the subheading used in the TSUS, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, will be governed by use, not exemplars. Therefore, plaintiffs argue, since the merchandise at issue is to be used or carried within a handbag, it squarely falls under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p>Also, plaintiffs argue, while the exemplars in the statute and Explanatory Notes may not be used as limitations for classification under heading 4202.32, they are relevant for determining the essential characteristics, under the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule of statutory construction,<sup>[17]</sup> of items classifiable within subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Plaintiffs assert the cosmetics bags at issue share the essential characteristics of the exemplars enumerated in the statute and Explanatory Notes. Like the exemplars, the merchandise at issue is small, lightly constructed and designed to be carried in a handbag and is normally so carried. Therefore, the merchandise at issue is properly classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1273</span> b. <i>Improper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.</i>\"</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue is not classifiable under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... With outer surface of sheeting of plastic ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" dutiable at a rate of 20% <i>ad valorem.</i> First, plaintiffs contend Customs improperly classified the merchandise at issue within a residuary subheading without determining first whether the article was classifiable within any of the other available subheadings. Plaintiffs maintain the merchandise at issue is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Without refutation of this classification, plaintiffs argue, Customs's classification of the cosmetics bags under the residuary subheading in Chapter 42, HTSUS, \"Other\" is improper. Moreover, plaintiffs contend Additional U.S. Note 1 (U.S. Note 1)<sup>[18]</sup> requires Customs to exclude the merchandise at issue from classification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, prior to using subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, \"Other.\"</p>\n<p>Second, plaintiffs contend Customs's classification under subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, \"Other\" is contrary to the classification methodology set forth by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). GRI 6<sup>[19]</sup> instructs comparisons be made only between tariff provisions at the same level of the tariff hierarchy. Len-Ron argues Customs's rationale for classification under subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, is based upon a comparison of two provisions that are not comparable, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" a subheading and \"Travel, sports and similar bags,\" a subordinate division of the subheading \"Other.\" Plaintiffs argue Customs's interpretation and analysis of the merchandise at issue under the HTSUS is erroneous.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs further argue, even if the merchandise at issue is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, and subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, GRI 3(a)<sup>[20]</sup> would mandate classification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, because it offers \"the most specific description\" of the merchandise at issue. Moreover, even if the subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, could be compared with subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" plaintiffs contend, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, would still be the proper classification because the merchandise at issue does not share essential characteristics with the exemplars enumerated under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS. Citing U.S. Note 1 to Chapter 42 of the HTSUS, plaintiffs maintain, unlike travel, sports and similar bags, the merchandise at issue is not designed to carry clothing and other personal effects during travel. Also, plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue is not designed to be carried independently but within another container. Therefore, plaintiffs assert the merchandise at issue may not be properly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1274</span> classified under subheading 4202.92.45, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Improper Classification under Subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.</i>\"</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags may not be classified properly under the <i>eo nomine</i><sup>[21]</sup> tariff term \"[V]anity cases\" in subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>First, plaintiffs contend the term \"[V]anity cases\" is ambiguous and dictionary definitions of the term and expert testimony reveal three distinct forms of the article: a compact, a handbag and a small piece of luggage. Plaintiffs maintain the statute refers to the third definition, a small piece of luggage. Plaintiffs base their argument on the drafting history of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Len-Ron notes the HTS is a multi-national tariff with international nomenclature, and the meaning of a term must be construed in the context of the various languages in which the HTS is written. According to plaintiffs, under the international nomenclature, HTS headings and subheadings should encompass the same items despite language differences. Plaintiffs contend the first part of the heading 4202, <i>i.e.,</i> \"Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases, camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers ...,\" which includes the term \"vanity cases,\" was intended to include items of luggage. Comparing the English and French terminology under heading 4202, HTSUS, plaintiffs maintain the term \"vanity cases\" was intended by the drafters to be equivalent to the French term \"les mallettes de toilettes,\" <i>i.e.,</i> little trunks for toilet articles. According to plaintiffs, the merchandise at issue does not meet this definition.</p>\n<p>In addition, plaintiffs argue, under the rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> the cosmetics bags do not share essential characteristics with the containers listed in the first part of heading 4202 or in subheadings 4202.12, HTSUS, \"Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels and similar containers [<i>e.g.,</i> hat boxes, camera accessory cases, cartridge pouches, sheaths for hunting or camping knives.... <i>See</i> Ch. 42.02, Explanatory Notes].\" Plaintiffs maintain all the exemplars are designed to be carried independently as external bags, unlike the merchandise at issue. Therefore, plaintiffs contend the <i>eo nomine</i> provision of \"vanity cases\" under which defendant would classify the cosmetics bags has been shown by definition, legislative history and similitude to be limited to the type of vanity case that resembles a small suitcase for cosmetics. Therefore, plaintiffs argue the merchandise at issue may not be classified properly under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p>For all the reasons cited above, plaintiffs assert the proper classification of the merchandise at issue is under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Defendant</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in Part</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to U.S. CIT R. 12(b), defendant, United States, moves to dismiss the twenty-three entries for which classification was not protested. Defendant argues it is fundamental that in order for the Court to have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) over the twenty-three entries at issue in this motion, it was necessary for plaintiffs to have protested Customs's classification for each entry pursuant to 19 U.S.C. §§ 1514 and 1515. The government contends because plaintiffs did not protest the classification of the twenty-three entries it seeks to dismiss, the Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1275</span> may not properly exercise jurisdiction over those entries. Accordingly, defendant moves for dismissal with respect to those twenty-three entries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues there are no issues of material fact, and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Defendant contends the cosmetics bags at issue should be classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases,\" and, in the alternative, under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\" Defendant maintains the cosmetics bags are not classifiable properly under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues the cosmetics bags should be classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, an <i>eo nomine</i> provision for \"vanity cases.\" Finding the term ambiguous, defendant acknowledges the common dictionary meaning of the term \"vanity case\" includes several forms of the article, <i>e.g.,</i> a small luggage bag for holding cosmetics, small container to carry cosmetic accessories. Even so, defendant argues Congress is presumed to know the language of commerce so as to classify commodities according to the general usage and denomination of the trade; therefore, in the absence of legislative intent, an <i>eo nomine</i> provision includes all forms of an article. Defendant contends the merchandise at issue fits squarely within the common meaning of the term \"vanity cases\" as used in the HTSUS. Defendant asserts a vanity case is a small handbag or case for carrying cosmetics. Customs notes plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as cosmetics cases, defined as a small piece of luggage for cosmetics. Based on the similarity of their definitions, defendant argues a cosmetic case is a vanity case. Therefore, the merchandise at issue may be classified properly under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p>Defendant also argues plaintiffs may not argue under the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> to refute classification of the cosmetics bags under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS. Defendant contends since the merchandise at issue falls squarely within the common meaning of the term \"[V]anity case[]\" in the subheading, <i>ejusdem generis</i> may not be used to restrict the scope of the provision. Defendant contends the common meaning of the term \"vanity case\" is clear. Therefore, rules of construction such as <i>ejusdem generis</i> may not be used to narrow the term's common meaning.</p>\n<p>Even so, defendant contends, if the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> applies and the term \"vanity cases,\" in fact, only applies to luggage, the cosmetics bags would still be classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"similar containers.\" Defendant argues all the articles enumerated in subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, are traveling bags used to carry different types of articles. Since the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> requires only that the merchandise possess the essential character running through all enumerated exemplars, defendant maintains the merchandise at issue is <i>ejusdem generis</i> because it is a travel bag used to carry cosmetics. Defendant contends plaintiffs' argument using <i>ejusdem generis</i> has no merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Proper Classification of the Merchandise at Issue under Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, Customs argues the cosmetics bags were classified properly upon entry under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\" Defendant maintains, contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, it classified the merchandise under the residuary subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, by relying upon the plain meaning of the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1276</span> and not upon a comparison between subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" and subheading 4202.92, HTSUS, \"Other.\" According to Customs, the cosmetics bags are not classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS; therefore, Customs's choice of the residuary subheading was appropriate.</p>\n<p>According to Customs, the cosmetics bags fall under the statutory definition of \"[t]ravel, sports and similar bags\" as provided by Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, HTSUS, \"goods ... of a kind designed for carrying clothing and other personal effects during travel.\" Defendant argues plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as travel bags, cases and pouches in marketing and advertising literature and, according to plaintiffs, the merchandise is designed to carry personal effects such as cosmetics. Accordingly, contends defendant, the cosmetics bags meet the statutory definition of \"Travel, sports and similar bags\" and therefore, it was classified properly under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Improper Classification under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Customs argues the language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is plain and unambiguous, and the merchandise at issue may not be classified properly under the subheading. Customs contends the statutory phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" was intended by Congress to refer only to small pocket articles. To bolster its argument, Customs cites the exemplars enumerated in the Explanatory Notes as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" <i>i.e.,</i> spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-folds), wallets, purses, key-cases, cigarette-cases, cigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches. Defendant claims the fact all these items may be carried in the pocket as well as in the handbag illustrates subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was only meant to include items which are capable of being carried in a pocket. Therefore, argues Customs, this size limitation precludes classification of the merchandise at issue under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, because the cosmetics bags are not small pocket articles.</p>\n<p>In addition, defendant uses HTS drafting history to support the validity of its conclusion that the plain meaning of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, only implicates small pocket articles. Customs argues, in 1978, the United States Administration proposed to the HSC an additional subheading for \"flat goods\" in heading 4202 which the United States' delegate explained was intended to give separate status to small pocket articles. According to defendant, the HSC agreed with the United States about the need for an additional subheading but in lieu of the phrase \"flat goods\" chose the phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" Defendant contends the phrase used in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was borrowed from Chapter 71 of the HTSUS and its Explanatory Notes classifying articles of jewelry, all of which may be carried in the pocket.<sup>[22]</sup> Also, defendant notes similar language was in use in the TSUS to define articles of jewelry, and a variation of this language was used to define \"flat goods.\" Defendant contends since the HSC essentially adopted the United States \"flat goods\" proposal in the Explanatory Notes, although under a different title, and since, according to the U.S. delegate, the \"flat goods\" provision was intended to include only small pocket articles, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" was intended only to cover small pocket articles.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1277</span> In addition, defendant contends when Congress recast the TSUS \"flat goods\" provision in the Explanatory Notes, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" it removed the term \"vanity cases\" from the exemplars that had been enumerated in the TSUS provision. According to Customs, the regrouping of \"vanity cases\" in an alternative subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, limited the scope of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, to small pocket articles. By changing the language of the recast flat goods provision to include only articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag and providing for vanity cases in a separate provision, Congress manifested an obvious intent to treat vanity cases separately and distinctly from those articles with which they had been grouped under the TSUS. Therefore, the merchandise at issue is not classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p>Customs also argues plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the cosmetics bags are \"of a kind\" normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag as required by the plain meaning of the statute. Customs notes classification within headings and subheadings using the phrase \"of a kind\" is controlled by use. Pursuant to the instruction of Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS,<sup>[23]</sup> defendant contends the cosmetics bags are not of the \"class or kind\" of goods described in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" because the merchandise at issue is not commercially fungible<sup>[24]</sup> with those items which define the class or kind of articles covered by subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. According to defendant, plaintiffs have produced no evidence of commercial fungibility. Defendant maintains, under the plain meaning subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, the cosmetics bags may not be classified properly as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, defendant argues the proper classification for the merchandise at issue is subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. MOTION TO DISMISS IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION</h2>\n<p>When a defendant challenges the Court's jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction exists. <i>See </i><i>Lowa, Ltd. v.

Therefore, because no protests were filed, the classification of the twenty-three entries at issue is final and conclusive. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></span>, 502 (CIT 1993) (\"Failure to protest [classification] results in the finality of the decision.\"). Accordingly, the Court finds it lacks jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) over those non-protested entries and grants defendant's motion dismissing the twenty-three entries at issue with respect to the classification cause of action. <i>See </i><i>Computime, Inc. v.

CROSS-MOTIONS FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This case is before the Court on plaintiffs' motion and defendant's cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Under U.S. CIT R. 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate if, based on the papers before the Court, \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\" and \"the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" When deciding summary judgment motions in classification cases, the Court must first ascertain the proper meaning of the specific terms in the tariff provision, a question of law, and second determine whether the merchandise at issue comes within the description of such terms as properly construed, a question of fact. <i>See </i><i>SGI, Inc. v.

The parties claim there are no genuine issues as to any material facts; therefore partial summary judgment is appropriate in this matter.

The HTSUS scheme is organized by headings; each of which has one or more subheadings providing a more particularized segregation of the heading at issue. <i>See id.</i> Under the GRI, the Court must first construe the language of the heading and any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1279</span> section or chapter notes in question to determine whether the product at issue is classifiable under the heading. Only then may the Court look to the subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise at issue. <i>See id.</i> at 1440; GRI 1, 6.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p>\"As with other statutory provisions, it is the function of the court to interpret the tariff acts in a manner that will fulfill or carry out the intent of Congress.\" <i>Meco Elec.

Because the Court finds the language of heading 4202, HTSUS, is unclear and legislative history provides this Court with no clarification as to those exemplars or phrases in heading 4202, HTSUS, under which the merchandise at issue may be classified properly, the Court will use the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> to ascertain whether the merchandise at issue may be classified properly under heading 4202, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>In applying the rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> the Court must consider whether the merchandise at issue possesses the essential characteristics or purposes that unite the listed examples preceding the general term or phrase in the statute. <i>See </i><i>Avenues in Leather, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764474\"><a href=\"/opinion/764474/avenues-in-leather-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span>, 1244 (Fed.Cir.1999). It is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1280</span> well-established that the essential characteristic and purposes of the heading 4202, HTSUS, exemplars is \"to organize, store, protect and carry various items.\" <i>SGI, Inc.,</i> 122 F.3d at 1471; <i>Totes, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></span>, 872 (CIT 1994). In this matter, the parties stipulate the cosmetics bags are used to contain, \"organize and segregate cosmetics [and toiletry products.]\" (Plaintiffs' Statement Under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts as to Which There is No Dispute (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts) at ¶ 10; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Statement under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts As to Which There is No Dispute (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts) at ¶ 10 (Admits but avers irrelevant).) Due to the breadth of exemplars listed in heading 4202, HTSUS, the exemplars' essential characteristics and purpose, the parties' stipulation, and the Court's inability to find any other appropriate heading, the Court finds the merchandise at issue properly classified under heading 4202, HTSUS, because it is used to organize personal items, <i>i.e.,</i> cosmetics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Proposed Subheading Classifications within Heading 4202, HTSUS.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In this matter, the parties advance three subheadings within heading 4202, HTSUS, as possible classifications for the merchandise at issue: subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases;\" subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag;\" subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, as \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Merchandise at Issue Prima Facie Classifiable under Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues the cosmetics bags are properly classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\" Plaintiffs oppose this classification. This Court agrees with defendant that the merchandise at issue is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>Subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases\" is an <i>eo nomine</i> tariff designation.<sup>[29]</sup> Even so, the Court finds the term is not clearly defined by the headings, subheadings, or chapter notes of Chapter 42, HTSUS. In addition, the Court finds Congress did not specify its intent as to the term \"vanity cases.\" <i>See</i> subheading 4202.12, HTSUS. Thus, the Court must determine the common meaning of the term \"[V]anity case\" as used in the statute. <i>See </i><i>North Am.,</i> 56 F.Supp.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p>Various definitions of the term \"vanity case\" are advanced by \"dictionaries and other reliable sources\" to which the Court looks to discern a tariff term's common meaning. <i>Id.</i> at 1179. The OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 430 (2d. ed.1989) defines \"vanity case\" as \"a small hand-bag, etc., for ladies, fitted with a mirror and powder-puff.\" According to the AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 1944 (3rd ed.1996), a \"vanity case\" is \"1. [a] small handbag or case used by women for carrying cosmetics or toiletries. 2. a woman's compact.\" The RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1580 (1966) defines the term as \"a small luggage bag or case for holding cosmetics or toiletries used or carried by women.\" The Court notes the common meaning of the term \"vanity case\" appears to include various forms of the article: a compact; a small handbag or case used by women for carrying cosmetics; and a small luggage bag for cosmetics.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the term \"[V]anity case[]\" as used in heading 4202, HTSUS, and subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, only refers to a small piece of luggage for cosmetics. Plaintiffs base their argument on the Session Notes of the Harmonized System Committee (HSC) of the Customs Cooperation Council and its working party. Comparing terminology in the French and English versions of the HTS, plaintiffs maintain, the term \"[V]anity cases,\" as used in the HTSUS, was intended to be the equivalent of the French term \"les mallettes de toillettes,\" <i>i.e.,</i> little trunk for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1281</span> toilet articles. The Court finds plaintiffs' argument unpersuasive.<sup>[30]</sup></p>\n<p>\"Congress is presumed to know the language of commerce, and to have framed tariff acts so as to classify commodities according to the general usage and denomination of the trade.\" <i>John v. Carr &amp; Son, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cust. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span>, 107 (1976). Therefore, because Congress used the term \"vanity cases\" within the statute without limitation as to form, it may be presumed all forms of the articles are meant by Congress to be included therein. \"`[A]n eo nomine designation, with no terms of limitation, will ordinarily include all forms of the named article.'\" <i>Carl Zeiss,</i> 195 F.3d at 1379 (quoting <i>Hayes-Sammons Chem. Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.C.P.A.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span>, 75 (1968)). Because the Court finds the common meaning of the term \"vanity case[]\" includes a small handbag or case used to hold cosmetics, the Court finds the merchandise at issue in this matter, described by the parties as cosmetics bags used to contain cosmetics, <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Merchandise at Issue Prima Facie Classifiable under Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the cosmetics bags are classified properly under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" Defendant opposes such classification arguing the plain and unambiguous language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, precludes such classification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. <i>\"[I]n the pocket or in the handbag\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendant first argues the language of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, specifically \"in the pocket or in the handbag,\" plainly and unambiguously indicates Congress only meant to include small pocket articles in the provision. Such an interpretation necessarily would exclude the merchandise at issue because it can not be carried in a pocket. In support, defendant cites the exemplars enumerated in the Explanatory Notes as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" and points out that those articles are capable of being carried in the pocket <i>and</i> in the handbag. Also, Customs cites the drafting history of the HTS to support \"the validity of [this] conclusion[].\" <i>Universal Transcon. Corp. v. J.E. Bernard &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.C.P.A.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span>, C.A.D. 573 (1954). Defendant contends because subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, was added pursuant to the suggestion from the United States delegate to the HSC that a subheading be added to encompass small pocket articles, the resulting phrase \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" should be read only to include small pocket articles.</p>\n<p>The Court agrees with defendant that the language \"in the pocket or in the handbag\" of subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is plain and unambiguous, however, the Court disagrees with Customs's narrow reading of the phrase. The defendant's construction of the statute would have the court ignore the disjunctive \"or\" and rob the phrase \"in the handbag\" of its independent and ordinary significance. <i>See </i><i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 338, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Subheading 4202, HTSUS, encompasses articles of a kind normally carried <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1282</span> \"in the pocket or in the handbag.\" \"Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise....\" <i>Id.</i> The Court notes \"[w]here the language of a statute demonstrates a clear intent of Congress, that intent is regarded as conclusive.\" <i>Marcor,</i> 926 F.Supp. at 1129. Accordingly, this Court finds articles normally carried in a handbag may fall within subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>In this matter, the parties stipulate the cosmetics bags may be \"small enough to be housed within a handbag.\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 9; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶ 9.) Given the parties' stipulation and the plain meaning of the phrase \"in the pocket or in the handbag,\" the Court finds the merchandise at issue is not precluded from classification under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. <i>\"Articles of a kind normally carried</i> ...\"</h2>\n<p>The first part of the statutory phrase used in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,\" invokes the concept of use due to its inclusion of the phrase \"of a kind.\" <i>See </i><i>Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314623\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314623/primal-lite-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag\" addresses the manner in which articles are employed or used, <i>i.e.,</i> \"normally carried,\" to serve their intended purpose or use.</p>\n<p>When use is invoked by the language of the HTSUS, the Court turns to Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1 (USRI 1), which states \"a tariff classification controlled by use ... is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that <i>class or kind</i> to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use.\" USRI 1 (emphasis added). In this case, the Court must determine whether the cosmetics bags are of \"that class or kind to which the imported goods belong.\" USRI 1; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Carborundum Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.C.P.A.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></span>, 377 (CCPA 1976). To make this determination the Court traditionally has used a totality of the circumstances test, specifically considering factors such as: the physical characteristics of the merchandise; the expectation of ultimate purchasers; the channels of trade; and use. <i>See </i><i>Carborundum,</i> 536 F.2d at 377. However, in 1999, the Federal Circuit appears to have renamed the traditional test to determine \"class or kind\" under USRI 1 under the guise of \"commercial fungibility.\" <i>Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765082\"><a href=\"/opinion/765082/primal-lite-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1362</span></a></span>, 1365 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\"[W]e construe the [HTSUS] to call for a determination as to the [class or kind] of goods that are commercially fungible with the imported goods.\").<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1283</span> In <i>Primal Lite,</i> the Federal Circuit affirmed a lower court ruling which focused on use between the kind or class of merchandise implicated by the HTSUS provision at issue, \"lighting sets of a kind used for Christmas trees,\" and the imported merchandise at issue. <i>See </i><i>Primal Lite,</i> 15 F.Supp.2d at 917. The \"commercial fungibility\" to which the Federal Circuit refers appears to implicate fungibility in terms of the use specified by the tariff provision at issue. Therefore, in order to find the merchandise at issue classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, it must have a use which is fungible with that which defines the class or kind described in the subheading, <i>i.e.,</i> normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</p>\n<p>The Court notes subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, does not specify the articles encompassed therein; however, the Explanatory Notes<sup>[33]</sup> for Chapter 42 provide \"[Subheadings 4202.21, 4202.32 and 4202.29] cover articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag and include spectacle cases, note-cases (bill-folds), wallets, purses, key-cases, cigarette-cases, cigar-cases, pipe-cases and tobacco-pouches.\" The class or kind defined by the subheading appears to be items which have independent and various functions, albeit normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</p>\n<p>In this matter, the parties stipulate: \"[w]omen normally carry some cosmetics with them so that they can have cosmetics with them on a daily basis;\" \"[w]omen normally carry a handbag for convenience to contain various personal items, including cosmetics, that they want to have about their person on a daily basis;\" and \"[c]osmetic bags are items that are used to carry cosmetics and [some<sup>[34]</sup> are] small enough to be housed within a handbag.\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶¶ 7, 8, 9; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶¶ 7, 8, 9 (Averring cosmetic bags large enough for nighttime use.).) In addition, defendant does not appear to specifically refute or contest expert testimony presented by plaintiffs that women normally carry cosmetics bags in their handbags.</p>\n<blockquote>Q. How did that mix of what she had match up to what you would normally [sic] from the rest of your research expect were [sic] the types of things that women will carry around in their handbag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well ... one of the sources that I read and that I quote in the book [<i>Bags, A Lexicon of Style,</i> Valerie Steele &amp; Laird Borrelli, (Scriptum Editions, 1999)] is from Esquire Magazine, which had an article a few years ago called \"Your Wife: A User's Manual, Her Purse\" ... the exact quote ... \"Women <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1284</span> carry useful objects, including medication, band-aids, an organizer ... cosmetics and cosmetic bag[s].... [O]ne thing that people almost always tend to mention is that they will carry cosmetics and a cosmetics bag....\"</blockquote>\n<p>(Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Exhibit P, Deposition of Dr. Valerie Steele at 65-67, 69.) Based on the parties' stipulations and uncontested expert testimony, the Court finds the cosmetics bags at issue may be housed in a handbag and are so normally carried. Therefore, the merchandise at issue has a use that is commercially fungible with the class or kind specified in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS.</p>\n<p>Defendant argues the merchandise at issue is not commercially fungible with the articles covered by subheading 4202.32, HTSUS. Defendant maintains plaintiffs have failed to bring forth evidence of commercial fungibility demonstrating the cosmetics bags are \"competitive with and can replace the articles `of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.'\" (Defendant's Reply Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's [sic] Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 12.) The Court finds defendant's analysis, grounded in notions of product substitutability, too narrow given the use provision at issue. As noted above, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is not a traditional use provision implicating the use of the merchandise at issue. Subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, addresses the manner in which articles are employed or transported. Accordingly, defendant's interpretation of commercial fungibility is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. On its face, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a provision encompassing various articles which are employed in a similar manner. Restricting classification in the manner advocated by defendant would narrow the subheading contrary to legislative intent. Moreover, defendant's application of fungibility is further refuted by the Explanatory Notes which include a list of \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" This Court notes these exemplars are not directly substitutable, <i>e.g.,</i> a wallet for a pipe-case, although they are fungible in the manner in which they are employed, <i>i.e.,</i> normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the Court finds the merchandise at issue <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, as \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other\" is a residuary or basket provision.<sup>[35]</sup> \"Classification of imported merchandise in a basket provision, however, is appropriate only when there is no tariff category that covers the merchandise more specifically.\" <i>Chevron Chem. Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"819642\"><a href=\"/opinion/819642/chevron-chemical-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Because the Court finds the merchandise at issue <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under two alternative subheadings which covers the merchandise at issue more specifically, the Court will not address classification under subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Subheading Preferred for Classification</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Court finds the cosmetics bags at issue <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under subheadings 4202.12, HTUSU, \"[V]anity Cases,\" and 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" Pursuant to GRI <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1285</span> 3(a), when a product is <i>prima facie</i> classifiable under two or more subheadings, \"[t]he [sub]heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to [sub]headings providing a more general description.\" GRI 3(a). Therefore, classification of the product turns on which of these two provisions is the more specific. <i>See </i><i>Orlando Food Corp. v.

However, this Court notes this rule is not obligatory and only provides a \"`convenient rule of thumb for resolving issues where the competing provisions are in balance [<i>i.e.,</i> equally descriptive].'\" <i>Carl Zeiss,</i> 195 F.3d at 1380 (quoting <i>Siemens Am.,</i> 653 F.2d at 478 n. 6); <i>see also </i><i>Totes, Inc. v.

In this matter, the Court must determine the relative specificity between subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, an <i>eo nomine</i> provision, and subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, a use provision.</p>\n<p>Even though the Court recognizes the long standing maxim that a use provision is usually more specific than an <i>eo nomine</i> provision, the Court declines to apply it to the instant case because the Court finds the competing subheadings do not \"equally describe\" the merchandise at issue. <i>See </i><i>E.M. Chems. v.

The court finds subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases,\" more specifically describes the cosmetics bags at issue than subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag.\" The Court's finding is premised on the Court's understanding that the use provision at issue in this case is not one which implicates the primary use of the merchandise at issue but rather the manner in which it is employed, <i>i.e.,</i> normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag. Unlike subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, which specifies a single article for proper classification, subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, is a broad provision encompassing a variety of articles with specific and independent uses as illustrated by the Explanatory Notes. Because the subheadings are not equally specific, the Court will not prefer the use provision over the <i>eo nomine</i> provision. Therefore, because the Court finds no other subheading more appropriate, the Court finds the merchandise at issue are correctly classified under subheading 4202.12, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the Court finds the merchandise at issue classified properly under subheading 4202.12.20, HTSUS, as \"[V]anity cases ...

The motion to consolidate this action was granted July 25, 1997.\n</p>\n<p>The Court notes no consolidated complaint was filed by the parties in this consolidated action.</p>\n<p>[9]  The entries for which plaintiffs contest classification are: Entry Nos. 456-2933533-5; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X. (<i>See</i> Defendant's Statement of Material Facts As to Which There is No Genuine Issue to be Tried (Defendant's Statement of Facts) at ¶ 3; Plaintiffs' Objection to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue to be Tried (Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Facts)(no objection to defendant's statements in ¶ 3).)\n</p>\n<p>The entries for which plaintiffs did not protest classification are: Entry Nos. 456-0002945-5; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X; XXX-XXXXXXX-X. (<i>See</i> Defendant's Statement of Facts at ¶ 4; Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Facts (no objection to defendant's statements in ¶ 4).)</p>\n<p>[10]  The Court notes plaintiffs refer to the merchandise at issue as \"cosmetic bags,\" (<i>see</i> Plaintiffs' Statement Under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts as to which There is No Dispute at ¶ 1 (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts)); however, throughout the opinion the Court will refer to the merchandise at issue as \"cosmetics bags\" for the purposes of this opinion. The Court finds the terms to be synonymous.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Court notes all the proposed classifications at issue in this matter may require the merchandise at issue to have a plastic component in order for classification to be proper. <i>See</i> heading 4202, HTSUS (\"[O]f sheeting of plastics\"); subheading 4202.12.20 (\"With outer surface of plastics\"), subheading 4202.32.10 (\"With outer surface of sheeting of plastic ... Of reinforced or laminated plastics\"), subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS (\"With outer surface of sheeting of plastic\"). Because this element of classification has been stipulated to by the parties and the Court finds its understanding of the tariff phrase comports with that stipulation, the Court, in its discussion, will refer only to the contested subheadings and phrases, namely subheadings 4202.12, HTSUS, \"[V]anity cases,\" 4202.32, HTSUS, \"Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or the handbag,\" and 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other.\"</p>\n<p>[12]  <i>See infra</i> note 34.</p>\n<p>[13]  The parties admit women normally carry a handbag containing various personal items wanted about their person for convenience. (<i>See</i> Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 8; Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Statement under Rule 56(i) of Material Facts as to Which There is no Dispute (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts) at ¶ 8.)</p>\n<p>[14]  The Explanatory Notes are the official interpretation of the scope of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (which served as the basis of the HTSUS) as viewed by the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC), the international organization that drafted the international nomenclature. <i>See </i><i>E.M.

The Court notes, however, working documents, such as commentary by delegations on questions before Harmonized System Committee which are designed to frame issues for discussion, carry virtually no weight in interpreting the Harmonized System even though they may contain more detailed descriptions of the goods under consideration and the rationale for certain positions. <i>See</i> STRUM, R., CUSTOMS LAW &amp; ADMINISTRATION, § 50.2, 17 (Supp.1999).</p>\n<p>[31]  The Court notes the phrase \"of a kind\" principally has been interpreted in tariff provisions utilizing the term \"use.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Primal Lite, Inc. v.

Even so, the Court does not find the lack of the term \"use\" in subheading 4202.32, HTSUS, a limitation because a designation by use may be established, although the word \"use\" or \"used\" does not appear in the language of the statute. <i>See </i><i>Lineiro v.

Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[34]  The Court notes plaintiffs maintain \"[c]osmetic bags are items that are used to carry cosmetics and it is small enough to be housed within a handbag.\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 9.) Defendant responds \"[a]dmit[ting] that cosmetics bags are containers that are used to carry cosmetics, aver[ring] that certain cosmetic bags are small enough to be used in conjunction with a handbag for daytime use....\" (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶ 9.) Also, plaintiffs aver the cosmetics bags \"are of a size to be carried in a handbag\" (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts at ¶ 11), and defendant responds \"den[ying] that these articles are all of a size to be carried in a handbag and avers that this denial does not create a genuine issue as to any material fact. Further avers that certain of these articles are themselves the size of handbags.\" (Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Facts at ¶ 11.) In brief, defendant further states \"cosmetic bags are certainly carried in the handbag.\" (Defendant's Reply Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 8.) The Court recognizes defendant's statements as to the size of some of the cosmetics bags at issue are directed to its argument that some of the cosmetics bags may be carried independently of a handbag. The Court notes, however, such a possibility does not mean such cosmetic bags may not be carried within a handbag, and that they are not normally so carried.</p>\n<p>[35]  The Court notes the parties agree subheading 4202.92.45, HTSUS, \"Other ... Travel, sports and similar bags ... Other,\" is a residuary provision.
