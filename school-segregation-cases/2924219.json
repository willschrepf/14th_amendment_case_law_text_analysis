INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their civil-rights suit\nagainst the City of New York (the “City”). They claim to be\ntargets of a wide-ranging surveillance program that the New\nYork City Police Department (the “NYPD”) began in the\nwake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (the\n“Program”). Plaintiffs allege that the Program is based on the\nfalse and stigmatizing premise that Muslim religious identity\n“is a permissible proxy for criminality, and that Muslim\nindividuals, businesses, and institutions can therefore be\nsubject to pervasive surveillance not visited upon individuals,\nbusinesses, and institutions of any other religious faith or the\npublic at large.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 6 (the “Complaint” or\n“Compl.”). They bring this lawsuit “to affirm the principle\nthat individuals may not be singled out for intrusive\ninvestigation and pervasive surveillance that cause them\ncontinuing harm simply because they profess a certain\nfaith.” Id. ¶ 8.\n\n        In its narrowest form, this appeal raises two questions:\nDo      Plaintiffs—themselves allegedly subject to a\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fdiscriminatory surveillance program—have standing to sue in\nfederal court to vindicate their religious-liberty and equal-\nprotection rights? If so, taking Plaintiffs’ non-conclusory\nallegations as true, have they stated valid claims under the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to our Constitution? Both\nof these questions, which we answer yes, seem\nstraightforward enough.      Lurking beneath the surface,\nhowever, are questions about equality, religious liberty, the\nrole of courts in safeguarding our Constitution, and the\nprotection of our civil liberties and rights equally during\nwartime and in peace.\n\nII.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.     Plaintiffs’ Allegations\n        Lead Plaintiff Syed Faraj Hassan and others of or\nassociated with the Islamic faith (collectively “Plaintiffs”)\nassert that, since January 2002, the City has through the\nNYPD conducted the Program in secret “to monitor the lives\nof Muslims, their businesses, houses of worship,\norganizations, and schools in New York City and surrounding\nstates, particularly New Jersey.” See Pls.’ Br. 2 (citing\nCompl. ¶¶ 36, 38). As this case comes before us on the City’s\nMotion to Dismiss, we must take all facts alleged in\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint as true and draw all reasonable\ninferences that arise therefrom in their favor. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6).\n              1.     The Program\n        Plaintiffs contend that the NYPD launched the\nProgram following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks\nwith the goal of “infiltra[ting] and monitor[ing] Muslim life\nin and around New York City.” Compl. ¶ 2. They claim that\nit “target[s] Muslim entities and individuals in New Jersey for\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\finvestigation solely because they are Muslim or believed to\nbe Muslim” rather than “based upon evidence of\nwrongdoing.” Id. ¶¶ 7, 47. Plaintiffs claim that the Program,\ngoing on its tenth year when the Complaint was filed, “has\nnever generated a single lead.” Id. ¶ 2.\n        Per the Complaint, the NYPD “uses a variety of\nmethods to spy on Muslims.” Id. ¶ 39. Among the\ntechniques that it employs are to “snap pictures, take video,\nand collect license plate numbers of [mosque] congregants”\nand to “mount surveillance cameras on light poles, aimed at\nmosques,”       which    “[o]fficers can     [then] control\n[remotely] . . . with their computers” and which generate\nfootage used “to help identify worshippers.” Id. ¶ 46.\nPlaintiffs also allege the NYPD sends “undercover\nofficers”—some of which are called “mosque crawlers” and\n“rakers”—into mosques, student organizations, businesses,\nand neighborhoods that “it believes to be heavily Muslim.”\nId. ¶¶ 47, 49–50.          By “monitor[ing] sermons and\nconversations in mosques” and “surveil[ling] locations such\nas bookstores, bars, cafes, and nightclubs,” officers\n“document[] . . . American Muslim life” in “painstaking\ndetail[]” and “report back to the NYPD.” Id. ¶ 47.\n        While Plaintiffs believe that some of this surveillance\nactivity is passive (such as “tak[ing] video and photographs at\nmosques, Muslim-owned businesses, and schools,” id. ¶ 39,\nand recording “the subject of conversations overheard at\nmosques,” id. ¶ 47), in other cases NYPD officers more\nactively engage with the persons monitored. One alleged\nspying method of the latter type is to “sen[d] undercover\nofficers to [Muslim-affiliated] locations to engage in\npretextual conversations to elicit information from proprietors\nand patrons.” Id. ¶ 39. Officers also “sometimes pose” as\nmembers of certain groups and organizations under\ninvestigation. Id. ¶ 50. The Complaint illustrates one such\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\fexample where an NYPD “officer . . . went on a rafting trip\nwith a[] [Muslim Students Association (MSA)] and\nmonitored and recorded how often the student participants on\nthe trip prayed” and their “discuss[ion of] religious\ntopics.” Id.\n       Not only does the alleged Program “utilize[] numerous\nforms of surveillance,” id. ¶ 45, but that surveillance is also\nwidespread. Plaintiffs claim, for instance, that the NYPD\n“has strived to have an informant inside every mosque within\na 250-mile radius of New York City” and has “place[d]\ninformants or undercover officers in all or virtually all\nMSAs” at “colleges and universities in New York, New\nJersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania . . . without any\nindication whatsoever of criminal activity or any connection\nwhatsoever to wrongdoing.” Id. ¶¶ 47, 49. In all, the NYPD\nhas allegedly “surveill[ed] . . . at least twenty mosques,\nfourteen restaurants, eleven retail stores, two grade schools\nand two [MSAs], in addition to an untold number of\nindividuals who own, operate, and visit those\nestablishments.” Id. ¶ 3.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that, in addition to singling out\norganizations and businesses for surveillance that in some\nway are visibly or openly affiliated with Islam (such as\nmosques or businesses with prayer mats or other Islamic\nidentifications), “the Program also intentionally targets\nMuslims by using ethnicity as a proxy for faith.” Id. ¶ 40.\nPlaintiffs aver, for instance, that the NYPD “has designated\ntwenty-eight countries . . . constitut[ing] about 80% of the\nworld’s Muslim population” and “American Black Muslim”\nas “ancestries of interest.” Id. ¶ 41. But the Program is still\ndecidedly focused on religion. Thus, rather than “surveil all\npeople and establishments with ‘ancestries of interest,’” the\nNYPD “expressly chooses to exclude people and\nestablishments with such ‘ancestries’ if they are not Muslim.”\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fId. ¶ 42. This includes “Egyptians if they are Coptic\nChristians, Syrians if they are Jewish, or Albanians if they are\nCatholic or Orthodox Christian.” Id. Conversely, Plaintiffs\nclaim that the NYPD has examined other immigrant\ncommunities in Newark, New Jersey “for the presence of\nMuslims,” such as the “Portuguese and Brazilian immigrant\ncommunities” notwithstanding that “Portugal and Brazil\n[are] . . . not found on [the NYPD’s] list of twenty-eight\n‘ancestries.’” Id. ¶ 44.\n              2.     Reports and Informational Databases\n       Plaintiffs allege that the Program has resulted in “a\nseries of reports documenting in detail the information\nobtained from [the NYPD’s] surveillance of New Jersey\nMuslim communities.” Id. ¶ 5. These “includ[e] a report\nfocusing on the Muslim community in Newark” (the “Newark\nreport”), id.; “more than twenty precinct-level maps of the\nCity of Newark, noting the location of mosques and Muslim\nbusinesses and the ethnic composition of the Muslim\ncommunity,” id. ¶ 3; “analytical report[s] on every mosque\nwithin 100 miles” of New York City, id. ¶ 47; and a weekly\n“MSA Report on schools, including reports on Rutgers New\nBrunswick and Rutgers Newark,” id. ¶ 51.\n       The information and records collected and compiled\nare extensive and varied.                  Among these are\n“pictures, . . . video, . . . and license plate numbers of\n[mosque] congregants,” id. ¶ 46; intelligence about “where\nreligious schools are located,” id. ¶ 47; indications of\nreligious affiliation and Muslim patronage of shops,\nrestaurants, and grocery stores, id.; lists of “businesses owned\nor frequented by Muslims,” id.; and “names of professors,\nscholars, and students” affiliated with MSAs, id. ¶ 51. The\nCity also allegedly “compiles databases of new Muslim\nconverts who take Arabic names, as well as Muslims who\n\n\n\n\n                                  13\n\ftake names that are perceived to be ‘Western.’” Id. ¶ 55.\n        Besides names and other identifying information of\nindividuals, businesses, and organizations, the NYPD reports\ninclude seemingly mundane and innocuous details about\nMuslim community life in New Jersey, such as: (1) “flyers\nare posted in shops advertising for Quran tutoring;” (2) “a\npicture of a mosque hangs in a grocery store;” (3) “a\nrestaurant serves ‘religious Muslims;’” (4) “customers visit a\nDunkin’ Donuts after Friday prayer;” (5) “a restaurant is\nlocated near a particular mosque;” (6) “employees or\ncustomers of establishments are observed wearing ‘traditional\nclothing;’” (7) “Muslim prayer mats are hanging on the wall\nat an Indian restaurant;” and (8) “a store posts a sign that it\nwill be closed on Friday in observance of Friday prayer.” Id.\n¶ 47. Finally, NYPD officers have compiled “the subject[s\nand details] of conversations overheard at mosques.” Id. In\none 2006 report, for instance, they “document[ed] twenty-\nthree conversations at twenty mosques,” though “[n]one of\nthe information collected showed any indication of criminal\nactivity.” Id.\n             3.     Fall-Out from the Program’s Disclosure\n                    to the Public\n       Plaintiffs claim that, despite “initial secrecy,” public\nknowledge of the alleged Program’s existence “has become\nwidespread in New Jersey and elsewhere.” Id. ¶ 45. They\nalso contend that a number of the allegedly generated reports\n“ha[ve] been widely publicized,” id. ¶ 20, and that each\nPlaintiff has been “either specifically named in an NYPD\nspying report or is a member of at least one mosque or other\nassociation named in such a report,” Pls.’ Br. 21 (citing\nCompl. ¶¶ 12–15, 17–26, 28–29, 31–32, 34).\n      Plaintiffs have learned since the news broke, for\n\n\n\n\n                                 14\n\finstance, that the NYPD’s so-called “Newark report”\ndesignates several of them as a “Location of Concern,”\ndefined “as, among other things, a ‘location that individuals\nmay find co-conspirators for illegal actions,’ and a ‘location\nthat has demonstrated a significant pattern of illegal\nactivities.’” Compl. ¶ 58. Similarly, the NYPD’s “U.S.–Iran\nreport” describes organizations believed to pose serious\nthreats to New York City, such as Hezbollah and Hamas,\nalong with a list of “Other Shi’a Locations in the vicinity of\nNYC,” which include Plaintiff Muslim Foundation Inc.\n(“MFI”) and Masjid-e-Ali mosque (owned and operated by\nMFI), “as well as three additional mosques attended by\nPlaintiff Hassan.” Id. ¶ 60.\n        While Plaintiffs allege that the Program is stigmatizing\nby itself, they also claim these specific defamatory statements\ntargeting them in particular have intensified their harms and\nthat “New York City officials” have exacerbated these\ninjuries by publicly “acknowledg[ing] the [Program’s]\nexistence” and “describing it as focused on ‘threats’ and as an\nattempt to document the ‘likely whereabouts of terrorists.’”\nId. ¶ 61. “Discussing the surveillance, [former] Mayor\nBloomberg has stated publicly” that “[w]e’re doing the right\nthing. We will continue to do the right thing.” Id. ¶ 64. And\n“[former Police] Commissioner Kelly has said” that “[w]e’re\ngoing to continue to do what we have to do to protect the\n[C]ity.” Id. Plaintiffs state that these and other “official\nproclamations,” which “falsely suggest that Muslims alone\npresent a unique law enforcement threat,” indicate “that [City\nofficials] believe the NYPD’s targeting of Muslims for\nsurveillance on the basis of their religion is appropriate and\nwill continue.” Id. ¶¶ 64–65.\n      Plaintiffs also contend that, in large part because of the\nProgram’s     alleged     stigmatizing      and     reputational\nconsequences, the surveillance has affected their worship and\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\freligious activities. For example, Plaintiff Hassan, a soldier\nin the U.S. Army who has worked in military intelligence,\nasserts that “[h]e has decreased his mosque attendance\nsignificantly” because of his belief that “being closely\naffiliated with mosques under surveillance by law\nenforcement” will jeopardize his ability to hold a security\nclearance and will tarnish his reputation among his fellow\nsoldiers and diminish their trust in him. Id. ¶¶ 11–13.\nLikewise, Plaintiffs Moiz Mohammed, Jane Doe, and Soofia\nTahir state that they now avoid (or have avoided) discussing\ntheir faith openly or at MSA meetings for fear of being\nwatched and documented, id. ¶¶ 24–30, and Plaintiff\nMohammad alleges that “[t]he stigma now attached to being a\nMuslim member of the MSA has caused [him] to avoid\ndiscussing his faith or his MSA participation in public and to\navoid praying in places where non-Muslims might see him\ndoing so,” id. ¶ 25.\n\n        The individual Plaintiffs are not the only ones affected.\nThe organizational Plaintiffs allege that the Program “has\nundermined their ability to fulfill their mission[s by] deterring\npotential members from joining and casting doubt on [their]\nability to maintain the confidentiality of their membership.”\nPls.’ Br. 6 (citing Compl. ¶ 17). According to the Complaint,\ntwo mosques that are members of Plaintiff Council of Imams\nin New Jersey, and that are named in the NYPD’s Newark\nreport, “have . . . seen a decline in attendance . . . as a result\nof the [NYPD’s] surveillance” because their congregants can\nno longer worship freely knowing that law-enforcement\nagents or informants are likely in their midst. Compl. ¶ 15.\nSimilarly, “[a]s affinity student groups, MSAs subject to\nsurveillance . . . are diminished in their ability to establish\nviable student organizations that students will feel secure\njoining and participating in” and are less able “to embark\nupon integral partnerships with campus administrators and\nother organizations and [to] fulfill the spiritual needs of their\n\n\n\n                                   16\n\fmembers in a confidential manner.” Id. ¶ 17. And Plaintiff\nMFI has changed its religious and educational programming\nto avoid controversial topics likely to stigmatize its\nmembership further and to attract additional NYPD attention.\nId. ¶ 23.\n       Finally, several Plaintiffs also contend that financial\nharm has accompanied their alleged religious, reputational,\nand stigmatizing injuries. For example, Plaintiffs All Shop\nBody Inside & Outside and Unity Beef Sausage Company\nclaim that the surveillance has damaged their “business[es] by\nscaring away customers,” id. ¶¶ 19, 21, and Plaintiffs Zaimah\nAbdur-Rahim and Abdul-Hakim Abdullah allege that the\npublication of the address and a photograph on the Internet of\ntheir home “in connection with the NYPD’s\nsurveillance . . . has decreased [its] value . . . and diminished\n[its] prospects for sale,” id. ¶¶ 31–32, 34. Also, two of\nPlaintiff Council of Imams in New Jersey’s member mosques\nhave witnessed “[l]osses in . . . financial support,” which\nfurther “harm[s] both mosques’ ability to fulfill their religious\nmissions.” Id. ¶ 15.\n\n       B.     District Court\n        In June 2012, Plaintiffs sued the City pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 and Monell v. Department of Social Services of\nthe City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), for discriminating\nagainst them as Muslims in violation of the Free Exercise and\nEstablishment Clauses of the First Amendment and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They seek\nexpungement of any unlawfully obtained records pertaining\nto them, a judgment declaring that the City has violated their\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights, an order enjoining\ntheir future discriminatory surveillance, and damages.\n       The District Court granted the City’s Motion to\n\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\fDismiss the Complaint in February 2014 pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of standing and\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\nclaim. First, the Court held that Plaintiffs failed to identify\nany cognizable “injury-in-fact” (let alone one “fairly\ntraceable” to the City’s surveillance). Second, it concluded\nthat Plaintiffs failed to state a claim because “[t]he more\nlikely explanation for the surveillance was a desire to locate\nbudding terrorist conspiracies” than a desire to discriminate.\nHassan v. City of New York, No. 12-cv-3401, 2014 WL\n654604, at *7 (D.N.J. Feb. 20, 2014). It therefore entered\njudgment in the City’s favor. Plaintiffs now appeal these\nrulings.\n\nIII.   STANDING\n        As did the District Court, we begin with Plaintiffs’\nstanding to have a federal court decide their claims. Standing\nto sue is required for jurisdiction in a federal forum. Derived\nfrom Article III of our Constitution, it is the threshold inquiry\nin every case, one for which “[t]he party invoking federal\njurisdiction bears the burden of [proof].” Lujan v. Defenders\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). Analyzing this\nrequirement entails a three-part inquiry. Has at least one\nplaintiff suffered an “injury in fact”? Id. If so, is that injury\n“fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\ndefendant”? Id. at 560 (alterations in original) (quoting\nSimon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42\n(1976)). And if the answer to both is yes, will that injury be\n“likely . . . redressed by a favorable decision”? Id. at 561\n(quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 38).\n       When answering these questions, “we must assume\nthat the party asserting federal jurisdiction is correct on the\nlegal merits of his claim, that a decision on the merits would\nbe favorable[,] and that the requested relief would be\n\n\n\n\n                                  18\n\fgranted.” Cutler v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs.,\n797 F.3d 1173, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In other words, to withstand a “facial attack”\nat the motion-to-dismiss stage, a plaintiff need only plausibly\nallege facts establishing each constitutional requirement.\nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 (1996).\n       A.     Injury-in-Fact\n       A plaintiff alleges injury-in-fact when it claims that it\nhas, or is in imminent danger of having, suffered “an invasion\nof a legally protected interest” that is “concrete and\nparticularized” and “‘actual or imminent, not conjectural and\nhypothetical.’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (quoting Whitmore v.\nArkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The burden is low, requiring nothing more\nthan “‘an identifiable trifle’ of harm.” Joint Stock Soc’y v.\nUDV N. Am., Inc., 266 F.3d 164, 177 (3d Cir. 2001) (Alito,\nJ.) (quoting United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory\nAgency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 686 (1973)).\n       While Plaintiffs point to at least four other injuries\nthey contend also meet this requirement, “[t]he indignity of\nbeing singled out [by a government] for special burdens on\nthe basis of one’s religious calling,” Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712, 731 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting), is enough to get in the\ncourthouse door. Unequal treatment is “a type of personal\ninjury [that] ha[s] long [been] recognized as judicially\ncognizable,” Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 738 (1984),\nand virtually every circuit court has reaffirmed1—as has the\n\n\n\n1\n  See, e.g., Davis v. Guam, 785 F.3d 1311, 1315 (9th Cir.\n2015) (“[E]qual treatment under law is a judicially cognizable\ninterest . . . even if it brings no tangible benefit to the party\n\n\n\n                                  19\n\fSupreme Court—that a “discriminatory classification is itself\na penalty,” Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 505 (1999), and thus\nqualifies as an actual injury for standing purposes, where a\ncitizen’s right to equal treatment is at stake. See also Ne. Fla.\nChapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of\nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 657 (1993) (“The ‘injury in\nfact’ . . . is the denial of equal treatment . . . .”).2\n\n\n\nasserting it.”); Am. Civil Liberties Union of N.M. v.\nSantillanes, 546 F.3d 1313, 1319 (10th Cir. 2008) (“The\ninjury in fact is the denial of equal treatment.”); Planned\nParenthood of S.C. Inc. v. Rose, 361 F.3d 786, 790 (4th Cir.\n2004) (“Discriminatory treatment . . . qualif[ies] as an actual\ninjury for standing purposes.”); Lutheran Church-Mo. Synod\nv. FCC, 154 F.3d 487, 493 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (“[T]he claim\nthat the litigant was denied equal treatment is sufficient to\nconstitute Article III ‘injury in-fact.’”); Peyote Way Church of\nGod, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 922 F.2d 1210, 1214 n.2 (5th Cir.\n1991) (“[I]llegitimate unequal treatment is an injury unto\nitself . . . .”).\n2\n   Plaintiffs’ personal interest in religious equality falls\nsquarely within the zone of those protected by the\nconstitutional guarantees in question. While their claims\ncertainly strike at the heart of the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment’s guarantee\nof freedom of religion includes freedom from religious\ndiscrimination. See, e.g., Permoli v. Municipality No. 1 of\nNew Orleans, 44 U.S. 589, 597 (1845) (“Equality before the\nlaw is of the very essence of liberty, whether civil or\nreligious.”); Colo. Christian Univ. v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245,\n1257 (10th Cir. 2008) (McConnell, J.) (“From the beginning,\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\f       None of the City’s arguments to the contrary are\npersuasive. First, its argument that unequal treatment is only\ninjurious when it involves a tangible benefit like college\nadmission or Social Security takes too cramped a view of\nArticle III’s injury requirement. As the Supreme Court has\nnoted,\n       discrimination itself, by perpetuating “archaic\n       and stereotypic notions” or by stigmatizing\n       members of the disfavored group as “innately\n       inferior” and therefore as less worthy\n       participants in the political community, can\n       cause serious noneconomic injuries to those\n\n\n\nthis nation’s conception of religious liberty included, at a\nminimum, the equal treatment of all religious faiths without\ndiscrimination or preference.”); cf. Karl Loewenstein, Some\nGeneral Observations on the Proposed “International Bill of\nRights” 17 (1942).\n       “[T]he Religion Clauses . . . and the Equal Protection\nClause as applied to religion . . . all speak with one voice on\nthis point: Absent the most unusual circumstances, one’s\nreligion ought not affect one’s legal rights or duties or\nbenefits.” Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Vill. Sch. Dist. v.\nGrumet, 512 U.S. 687, 715 (1994) (O’Connor, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in the judgment in part); see also, e.g.,\nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S.\n819, 845 (1995); Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244–45\n(1982); Comm. for Pub. Educ. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,\n413 U.S. 756, 792–93 (1973); Gillette v. United States, 401\nU.S. 437, 449 (1971); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97,\n104 (1968); Everson v. Bd. of Educ. of Ewing Twp., 330 U.S.\n1, 15 (1947).\n\n\n\n                                  21\n\f       persons who are personally denied equal\n       treatment solely because of their membership in\n       a disfavored group.\nHeckler, 465 U.S. at 739–40 (citation omitted) (quoting Miss.\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725 (1982)); see\nalso, e.g., Mardell v. Harleysville Life Ins. Co., 65 F.3d 1072,\n1074 (3d Cir. 1995) (per curiam) (“[A] victim of\ndiscrimination suffers a dehumanizing injury as real as, and\noften of far more severe and lasting harm than, a blow to the\njaw.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). After all, “[t]he\nfundamental concern of discrimination law is to redress the\ndignitary affront that decisions based on group characteristics\nrepresent, not to guarantee specific economic expectancies.”\nSandberg v. KPMG Peat Marwick, L.L.P., 111 F.3d 331, 335\n(2d Cir. 1997).\n        The City next argues that Plaintiffs have suffered no\ninjury-in-fact because it has not overtly condemned the\nMuslim religion. City Br. 35. This argument does not stand\nthe test of time.         Our Nation’s history teaches the\nuncomfortable lesson that those not on discrimination’s\nreceiving end can all too easily gloss over the “badge of\ninferiority” inflicted by unequal treatment itself. Closing our\neyes to the real and ascertainable harms of discrimination\ninevitably leads to morning-after regret. Compare Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 551 (1896) (“[If] enforced\nseparation of the two races stamps the colored race with a\nbadge of inferiority . . . [,] it is not by reason of anything\nfound in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses\nto put that construction upon it.”), with Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,\n347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954) (“To separate [children] from\nothers of similar age and qualifications solely because of their\nrace generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the\ncommunity that may affect their hearts and minds in a way\nunlikely ever to be undone.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\f       Moving on, we are similarly unpersuaded by the City’s\nalternative argument that Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are not\n“particularized.” It is true that “only . . . a complainant [who]\npossesses something more than a general interest in the\nproper execution of the laws . . . is in a position to secure\njudicial intervention.” Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 304\n(1944). But where a plaintiff is “asserting [his or her] own\n[equality] right,” a claim of discrimination, even where it\naffects a broad class, “is not an abstract concern or\n‘generalized grievance.’” Ad Hoc Comm. of Concerned\nTeachers v. Greenburgh #11 Union Free Sch. Dist., 873 F.2d\n25, 29 (2d Cir. 1989) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n499 (1975)). Because Plaintiffs in this case claim to be the\nvery targets of the allegedly unconstitutional surveillance,\nthey are unquestionably “affect[ed] . . . in a personal and\nindividual way.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1.\n        Further, that hundreds or thousands (or even millions)\nof other persons may have suffered the same injury does not\nchange the individualized nature of the asserted rights and\ninterests at stake. See, e.g., Sch. Dist. v. Schempp, 374 U.S.\n203, 223 (1963) (calling religious freedom an “individual”\nright); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227\n(1995) (referring to a citizen’s “personal right to equal\nprotection of the laws” (emphasis in original)). Standing is\neasily recognized, for instance, in the case of “a widespread\nmass tort,” even though “large numbers of individuals suffer\nthe same common-law injury.” FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11,\n24 (1998). And for good reason: “[t]o deny standing to\npersons who are in fact injured[,] simply because many others\nare also injured, would mean that the most injurious and\nwidespread Government actions could be questioned by\nnobody.” Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 526 n.24\n(2007) (emphasis omitted) (quoting SCRAP, 412 U.S. at 688).\nHarm to all—even in the nuanced world of standing law—\ncannot be logically equated with harm to no one.\n\n\n\n                                  23\n\f       Against this background, the City’s reliance on Laird\nv. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 (1972), is misplaced. The plaintiffs\nthere alleged only a “chilling effect” on third parties’ speech\ncaused by “the mere existence, without more, of [non-\ndiscriminatory] governmental investigative and data-\ngathering activity.” Id. at 10–11. Plaintiffs here, by contrast,\nallege that the discriminatory manner by which the Program\nis administered itself causes them direct, ongoing, and\nimmediate harm. Because “standing . . . is only a problem\nwhere no harm independent of the First Amendment is\nalleged,” Gill v. Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d 379, 383 (2d Cir. 2004)\n(Calabresi, J.), and Laird doesn’t stand for the proposition\nthat public surveillance is either per se immune from\nconstitutional attack or subject to a heightened requirement of\ninjury, that case’s “narrow” holding, see 408 U.S. at 15,\ndoesn’t reach the facts of this case.\n         Indeed, in several post-Laird cases we have recognized\nthat, while surveillance in public places may not of itself\nviolate any privacy right,3 it can still violate other rights that\ngive rise to cognizable harms. See, e.g., Hall v. Pa. State\nPolice, 570 F.2d 86, 91 (3d Cir. 1978) (“Although it may be\nassumed that the state may arrange for photographing all\nsuspicious persons entering the bank, it does not follow that\nits criterion for selection may be racially based, in the absence\nof a proven compelling state interest.” (citation omitted)); cf.\nAnderson v. Davila, 125 F.3d 148, 160–61 (3d. Cir. 1997)\n(Roth, J.) (while public governmental surveillance alone was\nnot cognizable, identical surveillance conducted in retaliation\n\n\n3\n We do not take a position on whether Plaintiffs could have\nbrought suit to vindicate such an interest. They do not allege\na violation of some constitutional right to privacy, but to\nequal treatment.\n\n\n\n                                   24\n\ffor one’s exercise of First Amendment rights gave rise to a\nseparate injury cognizable under Article III).\n\n       B.     Fair Traceability\n        The second requirement of injury-in-fact is a causal\nconnection between a defendant’s alleged conduct and the\nplaintiff’s harm. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. The City\ncontends that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy this requirement\nbecause the Associated Press (“AP”), not the NYPD, revealed\nthe Program to the public and did so without the City’s\npermission. In short, it argues, “What you don’t know can’t\nhurt you. And, if you do know, don’t shoot us. Shoot the\nmessenger.”\n       Aside from its distortions of the factual record,4 the\n\n\n4\n  Far from attesting to the NYPD and AP’s respective roles in\nrevealing the once-secret Program, the affidavit of defense\ncounsel on which the City relies merely states that the AP\nreported on the NYPD’s conduct and “released [unredacted]\ndocuments to the public at large beginning in . . . August\n2011.” Decl. of Peter G. Farrell ¶ 3. It is impossible to infer\nreasonably, let alone conclude, from this statement that the\nAP was the first (or only) public source of the information or\nthat the NYPD played no role for which it may be held\nlegally responsible.\n        Moreover, even if they were required to do so,\nPlaintiffs have produced ample evidence in rebuttal showing\nthat: (1) “[a] former NYPD informant . . . independently [of\nthe AP] revealed the NYPD’s practice of targeting innocent\nMuslims” by “sp[eaking] publicly in great detail about his\npart in the NYPD’s policy and practice of surveilling\nMuslims on the basis of religion,” Decl. of Glenn Katon ¶ 4;\n\n\n\n                                  25\n\fCity’s argument is legally untenable because (to repeat) the\ndiscrimination itself is the legally cognizable injury. Indeed,\ndiscrimination often has been likened to a “dignitary tort,”\nsee, e.g., Curtis v. Loether, 415 U.S. 189, 195 n.10 (1974)\n(quoting Charles O. Gregory & Harry Kalven, Jr., Cases and\nMaterials on Torts 961 (2d ed. 1969)), where “[t]he tort is\nsaid to be damage itself,” 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Dobbs Law of\nRemedies § 7.4(1), at 334 (2d ed. 1993). And, as with other\n“torts” in this category, “the affront to the other’s\ndignity . . . is as keenly felt by one who only knows after the\nevent that an indignity has been perpetrated upon him as by\none who is conscious of it while it is being perpetrated.”\nRestatement (First) of Torts § 18 cmt. e (1934). Because we\nview the claimed discrimination itself as the primary injury\nalleged, it “follows from our definition of ‘injury in fact’” that\nthe City “is the ‘cause’” of that injury rather than any member\nof the press.         Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen.\nContractors, 508 U.S. at 666 n.5.\n       Finally, even if only the collateral consequences of the\ndiscrimination—rather than the unequal treatment itself—\ncould count as Article III injury, the City “wrongly\nequat[es] . . . injury ‘fairly traceable’ to the defendant with\ninjury as to which the defendant’s actions are the very last\nstep in the chain of causation.” Constitution Party of Pa. v.\nAichele, 757 F.3d 347, 366 (3d Cir. 2014) (second alteration\nin original) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 168–69\n(1997)). That is incorrect. “[T]here is room for concurrent\n\n\n\nand (2) “[s]ince the AP began publishing reports regarding\nthe NYPD’s policy and practice of targeting Muslims for\nsurveillance, senior New York City officials have\nacknowledged and endorsed the NYPD’s tactics,” thus\n“propagat[ing] and amplif[ying] the harm,” id. ¶ 3.\n\n\n\n                                   26\n\fcausation in the analysis of standing, and, indeed, ‘an indirect\ncausal relationship will suffice, so long as there is a fairly\ntraceable connection.’” Id. (citation omitted) (quoting Toll\nBros. v. Township of Readington, 555 F.3d 131, 142 (3d Cir.\n2009) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Block v.\nMeese, 793 F.2d 1303, 1309 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, J.)\n(“[T]he question of core, constitutional injury-in-\nfact . . . requires no more than de facto causality.”); Pitt News\nv. Fisher, 215 F.3d 354, 361 (3d Cir. 2000) (“but for”\ncausation sufficient to establish traceability to establish\nstanding).\n\n       C.     Redressability\n          The last requirement of Article III standing is\nredressability, which requires the plaintiff to show that\n“it . . . [is] ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that\nthe injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’” Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 560 (quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 38).\nRedressability is “easily established in a case where,” as here,\n“the alleged injury arises from an identifiable discriminatory\npolicy.” Smith v. Meese, 821 F.2d 1484, 1494 (11th Cir.\n1987). While we cannot predict “the exact nature of the\npossible relief . . . without a full development of the facts, an\norder enjoining the policy and requiring non-discriminatory\ninvestigation and enforcement would redress the injury.” Id.\n       As for past harms, the potential avenues for redress\ndepend on how a particular plaintiff’s injury shows itself.\nThose plaintiffs able to prove “actual injur[ies]”—i.e., those\nother than “the abstract value of [the] constitutional right[s],”\nsuch as out-of-pocket losses or emotional distress—may\nrecover compensatory damages. Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v.\nStachura, 477 U.S. 299, 308 (1986); see also Carey v.\nPiphus, 435 U.S. 247, 264–66 (1978). For other plaintiffs,\n“the major purpose of the suit may be to obtain a public\n\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\fdeclaration that the[y are] right and w[ere] improperly\ntreated,” see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 901 cmt. c\n(1979), along with nominal damages that serve as “a\nsymbolic vindication of [their] constitutional right[s],”\nSchneider v. County of San Diego, 285 F.3d 784, 794 (9th\nCir. 2002) (quoting Floyd v. Laws, 929 F.2d 1390, 1403 (9th\nCir. 1991)).       Given the range of available remedies,\nredressability is easily satisfied.\n                 *      *      *        *     *\n        Confident in our jurisdiction to hear this case, we now\nturn to the merits of Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims and begin\nwith equal protection.\nIV.    CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n       A.     Equal-Protection Claim\n\n         The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to our Constitution provides that “[n]o State\nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1.\nPlaintiffs claim the City is contravening that mandate and\nviolating their rights by surveilling them pursuant to a\nProgram that investigates persons not because of any\nreasonable suspicion of wrongdoing (or other neutral\ncriterion) but solely because of their Muslim religious\naffiliation.\n       A “claim of selective investigation” by the police\ndraws on “‘ordinary equal protection standards.’” Flowers v.\nCity of Minneapolis, 558 F.3d 794, 798 (8th Cir. 2009)\n(quoting Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608 (1985)).\nAs with other equal-protection claims, we ask whether the\nCity intentionally discriminates against a reasonably\n\n\n\n\n                                   28\n\fidentifiable group and whether that intentional discrimination\nis nonetheless legally justified.\n\n              1.     Do Plaintiffs Plausibly Allege Intentional\n                     Discrimination?\n       To state an equal-protection claim, Plaintiffs must\nallege (and ultimately prove) “intentional discrimination.”\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 241 (1976); Pers. Adm’r\nof Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 276 (1979). It is not\nenough for them to allege that they are Muslim and that the\nNYPD surveilled more Muslims than members of any other\nreligion. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). Rather,\nPlaintiffs’ religious affiliation must have been a substantial\nfactor in that different treatment. Davis, 426 U.S. at 235;\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 276.\n\n                     i.     Plaintiffs Plausibly Allege a\n                            Surveillance Program with a\n                            Facially Religious Classification.\n\n       There are a variety of theories to consider in an equal-\nprotection claim of this type. First, Plaintiffs could point to a\npolicy that is facially discriminatory, meaning that the policy\n“by its own terms” singles out Muslims “for different\ntreatment.” 3 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise\non Constitutional Law § 18.4 (10th ed. 2012); see, e.g.,\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 213, 227–29. Second, they could\nidentify a policy that “either shows no classification on its\nface or else indicates a classification which seems to be\nlegitimate,” yet one that NYPD officers apply to Muslims\nwith a greater “degree[] of severity” than other religious\ngroups. Rotunda & Novak, supra, § 18.4; see, e.g., Yick Wo\nv. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373–74 (1886). Or, third, Plaintiffs\ncould identify a facially neutral policy that the City\npurposefully “designed to impose different burdens” on\n\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fMuslims and that (even if applied evenhandedly) does in fact\nhave the intended adverse effect. Rotunda & Novak, supra,\n§ 18.4; see, e.g., Village of Arlington Heights v. Met. Hous.\nDev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264–65 (1977).\n        Here, Plaintiffs seek to proceed by way of the first of\nthese three methods, arguing their “allegations leave no doubt\nthat the . . . [Program] relies on an express classification of\nMuslims for disfavored treatment.” See Pls.’ Br. 10. This is\na viable legal theory. Where a plaintiff can point to a facially\ndiscriminatory policy, “the protected trait by definition plays\na role in the decision-making process, inasmuch as the policy\nexplicitly classifies people on that basis.”5 Cmty. Servs. v.\nWind Gap Mun. Auth., 421 F.3d 170, 177 (3d Cir. 2005)\n(quoting DiBiase v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 48 F.3d 719,\n726 (3d Cir. 1995)). Put another way, direct evidence of\nintent is “supplied by the policy itself.” Massarsky v. Gen.\nMotors Corp., 706 F.2d 111, 128 (3d Cir. 1983) (Sloviter, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n\n\n5\n  To the extent the City focuses on Plaintiffs’ failure to allege\nthe existence of a written policy, there is no requirement that\na policy be reduced to written form. See, e.g., Johnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 502, 509 (2005) (holding that an\n“unwritten [prison] policy of racially segregating prisoners in\ndouble cells” was subject to strict scrutiny). As the Ninth\nCircuit has explained, “[t]he primary—indeed, perhaps\nonly—difference [between a suit involving a written and\nunwritten policy] is an evidentiary one.” Hoye v. City of\nOakland, 653 F.3d 835, 855 (9th Cir. 2011). While a\n“[p]laintiff[] ha[s] no difficulty establishing what a policy is\nwhen the policy is written,” “[a]n unwritten policy, by\ncontrast, is usually harder to establish.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                  30\n\f        The City nonetheless attacks the plausibility of the\nallegations, arguing that Plaintiffs point to only “conclusory\nallegations . . . spread throughout [the] . . . [C]omplaint,”\nwhich “as a matter of law cannot be credited.” City Br. 56. It\nfurther asserts that, “[o]nce the conclusory allegations are\npushed aside, the remaining factual allegations are\ninsufficient       to   find   a     facially    discriminatory\nclassification.” Id.\n        We disagree with this characterization. While the City\ncompares Plaintiffs’ claims to the conclusory allegations in\nIqbal, those were far from what we have here. In our case,\nPlaintiffs allege specifics about the Program, including when\nit was conceived (January 2002), where the City implemented\nit (in the New York Metropolitan area with a focus on New\nJersey), and why it has been employed (because of the belief\n“that Muslim religious identity . . . is a permissible proxy for\ncriminality,” Compl. ¶ 36). The Complaint also articulates\nthe “variety of methods” by which the surveillance is carried\nout. See, e.g., id. ¶ 39 (“tak[ing] videos and photographs at\nmosques, Muslim-owned businesses and schools”); id.\n(“monitor[ing Muslim] websites, listservs, and chat rooms”);\nid. ¶ 46 (“snap[ping] pictures, tak[ing] video, and collect[ing]\nlicense plate numbers of congregants as they arrive at\nmosques to pray”); id. ¶ 47 (“us[ing] undercover\nofficers . . . to  monitor       daily    life   in    [Muslim]\nneighborhoods . . . and sermons and conversations in\nmosques”); id. ¶ 49 (“plac[ing] informants or undercover\nofficers in all or virtually all MSAs”). These allegations are\nhardly “bare assertions . . . amount[ing] to nothing more than\na ‘formulaic recitation of the elements’ of a constitutional\ndiscrimination claim.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (quoting Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 544, 545 (2007)).\n      Despite the City’s demand for more information about\nwhen, by whom, and how the policy was enacted and where it\n\n\n\n\n                                  31\n\fwas written down, “the Twombly–Iqbal duo have not\ninaugurated an era of evidentiary pleading.” Santana v. Cook\nCnty. Bd. of Review, 270 F.R.D. 388, 390 (N.D. Ill. 2010)\n(emphasis in original); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570\n(rejecting the proposition that notice pleading “require[s]\nheightened fact pleading of specifics”). Nor do “factual\nallegations . . . become impermissible labels and conclusions\nsimply because the additional factual allegations explaining\nand supporting the articulated factual allegations are not also\nincluded.” In re Niaspan Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 3d 735,\n753 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhile it is possible that Plaintiffs will ultimately falter in\nmeeting their burden of proof, the collection of evidence is\nthe object of discovery.\n       Moreover, even if the pleading of “evidence” rather\nthan “grounds for relief” were required (which it is not), the\nComplaint includes numerous examples of persons that the\nNYPD is surveilling because of their religious affiliation.6\n\n\n\n6\n  To the extent the City means to argue that Plaintiffs have\nfailed to allege plausibly that even these exemplars have not\nbeen singled out by reason of their religious affiliation, we\ndisagree. Plaintiffs’ allegations, which draw on the sources of\ncircumstantial evidence commonly used to make out a prima\nfacie case of intentional discrimination in a disparate-\ntreatment suit of this type, easily satisfy the plausibility\nthreshold required to survive a motion to dismiss. See, e.g.,\nRojas v. Alexander’s Dep’t Store, Inc., 924 F.2d 406, 410 (2d\nCir. 1990) (“maintenance of records of the race of the\narrestees”); Marshall v. Colum. Lea Reg’l Hosp., 345 F.3d\n1157, 1170 (10th Cir. 2003) (McConnell, J.) (racial\ndesignation on a driving-citation form “where none was\n\n\n\n                                 32\n\fSee, e.g., Compl. ¶ 14 (the Masjid al-Haqq and Masjid Ali K.\nMuslim mosques); id. ¶ 17 (MSAs for Rutgers University\ncampuses at Newark and New Brunswick); id. ¶ 18 (All Body\nShop Inside & Outside); id. ¶ 20 (Unity Beef Sausage Co.);\nid. ¶ 22 (the Masjid-e-Ali mosque); id. ¶ 31 (Al-Hidaayah\nAcademy); id. (Al Muslimaat Academy). These allegations\nsupplement those that the NYPD “surveil[led] . . . at least\ntwenty mosques, fourteen restaurants, eleven retail stores, two\ngrade schools and two [MSAs] in New Jersey,” id. ¶ 38;\n“creat[ed] over twenty precinct-level maps of the City of\nNewark,” id.; and attempted to place an “informant inside\nevery mosque within a 250-mile radius of New York City” as\nwell as prepared an “analytical report on every mosque within\n100 miles,” id. ¶ 47.\n       Finally, because Plaintiffs allege that all of these\npersons and entities were surveilled without any reasonable\nsuspicion of wrongdoing (as noted above, they assert that,\n“[i]n all its years of operation, the Program has never\ngenerated a single [criminal] lead,” id. ¶ 2), this case can be\neasily contrasted with others where the law-enforcement\ninvestigation at issue was almost certainly explained by a\nreasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.7 Cf. George v. Rehiel,\n\n\ncalled for”); Jean v. Nelson, 711 F.2d 1455, 1495–96 (11th\nCir. 1983) (statistical evidence showing “glaring” effect on\nprotected class); Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d\n540, 587 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (disparities between minority\ngroups in “hit rates” combined with other evidence);\nRodriguez v. Cal. Highway Patrol, 89 F. Supp. 2d 1131, 1141\n(N.D. Cal. 2000) (statistical evidence).\n7\n  This of course is not to say that an absence or presence of\nreasonable suspicion in a particular case determines the\n\n\n\n                                 33\n\f738 F.3d 562, 586 (3d Cir. 2013) (“The TSA Officials’\nsuspicion was an obvious alternative explanation for their\nconduct, which negates any inference of retaliation.”). That\nwe might be able to conjure up some non-discriminatory\nmotive to explain the City’s alleged conduct is not a valid\nbasis for dismissal. It is “only when [a] defendant’s plausible\n\n\nviability of a plaintiff’s equal-protection claim. Cf. Whren v.\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (“[T]he Constitution\nprohibits selective enforcement of the law based on\nconsiderations such as race. But the constitutional basis for\nobjecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is\nthe Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment.\nSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause\nFourth Amendment analysis.”); United States v. Scopo, 19\nF.3d 777, 786 (2d Cir. 1994) (Newman, C.J., concurring)\n(“Though the Fourth Amendment permits a pretext arrest, if\notherwise supported by probable cause, the Equal Protection\nClause still imposes restraint on impermissibly class-based\ndiscriminations.”).\n        But although a lack of reasonable suspicion does not\nafford a presumption that a law-enforcement officer initiated\nan investigation on the basis of a protected characteristic, it is\ncertainly one factor that may be considered by a finder of\nfact. See Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 822 n.1\n(6th Cir. 2005) (“While the stop was justified from a Fourth\nAmendment perspective . . . [,] the lack of suspicion . . . may\nproperly be considered in the plaintiffs’ selective-\nenforcement claim.”); Anderson v. Cornejo, 284 F. Supp. 2d\n1008, 1055 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (citing “the lack of adequate\nsuspicion for a strip search” as probative of the fact that a\ncustoms officer “acted, at least in part, because [the plaintiff\nwas] an African-American woman”).\n\n\n\n                                   34\n\falternative explanation is so convincing” to render the\n“plaintiff’s explanation . . . implausible” that a court may\ndismiss a complaint. Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th\nCir. 2011) (emphasis in original).\n       In sum, because Plaintiffs have pleaded ample “factual\ncontent [that] allows [us] to draw the reasonable inference\nthat the [City] is liable for the misconduct alleged,” Iqbal,\n556 U.S. at 663, we decline to dismiss their Complaint on the\nground that they have not plausibly alleged a surveillance\nprogram with a facially discriminatory classification.\n\n                    ii     Intentional Discrimination Does\n                           Not Require an Invidious Motive.\n\n       The City also argues that, even assuming Plaintiffs\nhave plausibly alleged a facial classification based on\nreligious affiliation, their allegations of discriminatory\n“purpose” are implausible because “the more likely\nexplanation for the NYPD’s actions is public safety rather\nthan discrimination based upon religion.” City Br. 49. Its\nreasoning is essentially two-fold: “the surveillance is alleged\nto have begun just after the [September 11, 2001] terrorist\nattacks,” id., and “[t]he police could not have monitored New\nJersey for Muslim terrorist activities without monitoring the\nMuslim community itself,” id. (alteration in original) (quoting\nHassan, 2014 WL 654604, at *6).\n       Here’s the City’s problem: there’s a difference\nbetween “intent” and “motive.”          “[A] defendant acts\nintentionally when he desires a particular result, without\nreference to the reason for such desire. Motive, on the other\nhand, is the reason why the defendant desires the result.” 2\nHarry Sanger Richards et al., American Law and Procedure\n§ 8, at 6 (1922). In other words, “intent” asks whether a\nperson acts “intentionally or accidentally,” while “motive”\n\n\n\n\n                                 35\n\fasks, “If he did it intentionally, why did he do it?” 1 John\nWilliam Salmond, Jurisprudence § 134, at 398 (7th ed. 1924)\n(emphasis in original); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 881\n(Bryan Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014) (“While motive is the\ninducement to do some act, intent is the mental resolution or\ndetermination to do it.”). This fundamental “distinction\nbetween motive and intent runs all through the law.” Johnson\nv. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 155 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, C.J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).\n        In focusing on what the City contends was its\n“legitimate purpose[]” of “analy[zing] . . . potential [security]\nthreats and vulnerabilities,” City Br. 50, it wrongly assumes\nthat invidious motive is a necessary element of discriminatory\nintent. It is not. All you need is that the state actor meant to\nsingle out a plaintiff because of the protected characteristic\nitself. See, e.g., Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 485\n(2008); Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S.\n263, 269–70 (1993). In a school-segregation case, for\ninstance, “the ‘intent’ which triggers a finding of\nunconstitutionality is not an intent to harm black students, but\nsimply an intent to bring about or maintain segregated\nschools.” United States v. Sch. Dist. of Omaha, 521 F.2d 530,\n535 (8th Cir. 1975). Likewise, a prosecutor who strikes a\njuror on the basis of race discriminates intentionally even if\nmotivated by a sincere desire to win his case. See, e.g.,\nGeorgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 59 (1992).\n        So too here. While the absence of a legitimate motive\nmay bear on whether the challenged surveillance survives the\nappropriate level of equal-protection scrutiny, “intentional\ndiscrimination” need not be motivated by “ill will, enmity, or\nhostility” to contravene the Equal Protection Clause. Floyd v.\nCity of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540, 662 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)\n(quoting Ferrill v. Parker Grp., Inc., 168 F.3d 468, 473 n.7\n(11th Cir. 1999)); see also Cmtys. for Equity v. Mich. High\n\n\n\n\n                                  36\n\fSch. Athletic Ass’n, 459 F.3d 676, 694 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(distinguishing between “an intent to treat two groups\ndifferently” and “an intent to harm”); Garza v. County of Los\nAngeles, 918 F.2d 763, 778 n.1 (9th Cir. 1990) (Kozinski, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[T]here can be\nintentional discrimination without an invidious motive.”).\nThus, even if NYPD officers were subjectively motivated by\na legitimate law-enforcement purpose (no matter how\nsincere), they’ve intentionally discriminated if they wouldn’t\nhave surveilled Plaintiffs had they not been Muslim.\n              2.     Is   the     Alleged      Discrimination\n                     Nonetheless Legally Justified?\n         Once a plaintiff demonstrates treatment different from\nothers with whom he or she is similarly situated and that the\nunequal treatment is the result of intentional discrimination,\n“the adequacy of the reasons for that discrimination\nare . . . separately assessed at equal protection’s second step”\nunder the appropriate standard of review. SECSYS, LLC v.\nVigil, 666 F.3d 678, 689 (10th Cir. 2012). To apply this\ntraditional legal framework to the facts of this case, we must\ndetermine the appropriate standard of review (i.e., rational\nbasis, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny) and then ask\nwhether it is met.8\n\n                     i.     Level of Scrutiny\n       At a minimum, intentional discrimination against any\n“identifiable group” is subject to rational-basis review, which\n\n\n8\n  Although other modes of analysis have also been employed,\nsee, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2596 (2015),\nwe find it appropriate to apply the conventional two-part\nframework in the context of this case.\n\n\n\n                                  37\n\frequires the classification to be rationally related to a\nlegitimate governmental purpose. Johnson v. Cohen, 836\nF.2d 798, 805 n.9 (3d Cir. 1987). Where a “quasi-suspect” or\n“suspect” classification is at issue, however, the challenged\naction must survive “intermediate scrutiny” or “strict\nscrutiny.” 9 Intermediate scrutiny (applicable to quasi-suspect\nclasses like gender and illegitimacy) requires that a\nclassification “be substantially related to an important\ngovernmental objective.” Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461\n(1988). In contrast, strict scrutiny (applicable to suspect\nclasses like race and nationality) is an even more demanding\nstandard, which requires the classification be “narrowly\ntailored . . . [to] further [a] compelling governmental\ninterest[].” Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 270 (2003).\nStrict and intermediate scrutiny (which we collectively refer\nto as “heightened scrutiny” to distinguish them from the far\nless demanding rational-basis review) in effect set up a\npresumption of invalidity that the defendant must rebut.\n       Perhaps surprisingly, neither our Court nor the\nSupreme Court has considered whether classifications based\non religious affiliation10 trigger heightened scrutiny under the\n\n\n9\n   “Strict scrutiny” is also triggered in the case of a\n“fundamental right.” While “the right to free exercise of\nreligion” is fundamental, Lewis, 518 U.S. at 404, Plaintiffs\nproceed in this case on the theory that religious affiliation is a\nprotected class.\n10\n   We refer in this opinion only to discrimination based on\nreligious affiliation rather than involvement. Case law\ndistinguishes between the two. See, e.g., United States v.\nDeJesus, 347 F.3d 500, 510 (3d Cir. 2003) (Fuentes, J.)\n(“Because we affirm the District Court’s finding that the\n\n\n\n                                   38\n\fEqual Protection Clause.

We therefore confront a question of\nfirst impression in this Circuit.\n        Although the answer to this question is not found in\nbinding precedent, we hardly write on a clean slate. To start,\nit has long been implicit in the Supreme Court’s decisions\nthat religious classifications are treated like others\ntraditionally subject to heightened scrutiny, such as those\nbased on race. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464\n(1996) (naming “race” and “religion” as examples of\n“unjustifiable standard[s]” for a “decision whether to\n\n\n\ngovernment’s strikes were based on the jurors’ heightened\nreligious involvement rather than their religious affiliation,\nwe need not reach the issue of whether a peremptory strike\nbased solely on religious affiliation would be\nunconstitutional.”); United States v. Stafford, 136 F.3d 1109,\n1114 (7th Cir. 1998) (Posner, C.J.) (explaining that “[i]t is\nnecessary to distinguish among religious affiliation, a\nreligion’s general tenets, and a specific religious belief”),\nmodified, 136 F.3d 1115 (7th Cir. 1998). Nor do we mean to\nstate a position on the separate “question of whether all\nreligions together constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class.”\nChristian Sci. Reading Room Jointly Maintained v. City of\nSan Francisco, 807 F.2d 1466, 1467 n.1 (9th Cir. 1986)\n(Norris, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc)\n(stating this as a separate issue that the panel expressly\ndeclined to decide).\n\n\n\n                                  39\n\fprosecute” (quoting Oyler v.

Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 17\n(1979) (calling “race, religion, [and] alienage . . . inherently\nsuspect distinctions”); City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427\nU.S. 297, 303 (1976) (same); United States v.

Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938) (citations\nomitted) (emphasis added). And even before Carolene\nProducts, the Court considered religious discrimination to be\na classic example of “a denial of the equal protection of the\nlaws to the less favored classes.” Am. Sugar Ref. Co. v.\nLouisiana, 179 U.S. 89, 92 (1900); see also Hall v. De Cuir,\n95 U.S. 485, 505 (1877) (“Directors of schools in\nIowa . . . [cannot] deny a youth of proper age admission to\nany particular school on account of nationality, color, or\nreligion.”).\n       It is true that these statements are dicta. But even so,\nSupreme Court dicta “requires serious consideration,” United\nStates v. Marzzarella, 614 F.3d 85, 90 n.5 (3d Cir. 2010),\n\n\n\n\n                                  40\n\f“especially . . . when, as here, we encounter a decades-long\nsuccession of statements from the Court,” Myers v. Loudoun\nCnty. Pub. Sch., 418 F.3d 395, 410 (4th Cir. 2005) (D. Motz,\nJ., concurring in the judgment). Moreover, this dicta is\nconsistent with our own. Connelly v. Steel Valley Sch. Dist.,\n706 F.3d 209, 213 (3d Cir. 2013) (identifying “race, religion,\n[and] alienage” as “inherently suspect distinctions” (quoting\nSchumacher v. Nix, 965 F.2d 1262, 1266 (3d Cir. 1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. DeJesus,\n347 F.3d 500, 510–11 (3d Cir. 2003) (Fuentes, J.) (referring\nin dictum to “religious affiliation” as “a protected class”);\nTolchin v. Supreme Court of New Jersey, 111 F.3d 1099,\n1114 (3d Cir. 1997) (naming “race, religion or alienage” as\n“suspect distinctions”); United States v. Friedland, 83 F.3d\n1531, 1537 (3d Cir. 1996) (“[T]he government can[not]\nrefuse to move for a downward[] departure under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(e) [if] . . . base[d] . . . on a constitutionally suspect\nground such as race or religion.”).\n        We also are guided by other appellate courts that have\nsubjected religious-based classifications to heightened\nscrutiny. For instance, both the Eighth and Tenth Circuit\nCourts have held without fanfare that “[r]eligion is a suspect\nclassification,” Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d 1301, 1322\nn.10 (10th Cir. 2010); Patel v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 515\nF.3d 807, 816 (8th Cir. 2008), and the Second and Ninth have\ndone the same in so many words, see, e.g., United States v.\nBrown, 352 F.3d 654, 668 (2d Cir. 2003) (Calabresi, J.)\n(holding that the exercise of a peremptory strike due to a\nvenire member’s religious affiliation would violate Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), because “religious\nclassifications . . . trigger strict scrutiny”); Christian Sci.\nReading Room Jointly Maintained v. City of San Francisco,\n\n\n\n\n                                  41\n\f784 F.2d 1010, 1012 (9th Cir. 1986) (“It seems clear that an\nindividual religion meets the requirements for treatment as a\nsuspect class.”), amended, 792 F.2d 124 (9th Cir. 1986).11\n       Today we join these courts and hold that intentional\ndiscrimination based on religious affiliation must survive\n\n\n11\n   Some appellate courts have recognized the question as an\nopen one, see, e.g., St. John’s United Church of Christ v. City\nof Chicago, 502 F.3d 616, 638 (7th Cir. 2007); Wirzburger v.\nGalvin, 412 F.3d 271, 283 (1st Cir. 2005); Taylor v. Johnson,\n257 F.3d 470, 473 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (per curiam), but we\nare not aware of a single circuit court holding that religious\nclassifications are subject to only rational-basis review.\n        We also note that numerous state courts either have\nheld that religious affiliation is a suspect classification or\nhave issued opinions with strong dicta to that effect. See,\ne.g., Bagley v. Raymond Sch. Dep’t, 728 A.2d 127, 137 (Me.\n1999); Marrujo v. N.M. State Highway Transp. Dep’t, 887\nP.2d 747, 751 (N.M. 1994); Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of\nSaguache v. Flickinger, 687 P.2d 975, 982 n.9 (Colo. 1984)\n(en banc); State v. Correll, 626 S.W.2d 699, 701 (Tenn.\n1982); Burmaster v. Gravity Drainage Dist. No. 2 of St.\nCharles Parish, 366 So. 2d 1381, 1386 n.3 (La. 1978); Gunn\nv. Lane County, 20 P.3d 247, 251 (Or. App. 2001); LaCava v.\nLucander, 791 N.E.2d 358, 363 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003). But\nsee State v. Purcell, 18 P.3d 113, 121 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2001)\n(“In addition to being a fundamental right, religious affiliation\nalso may be a suspect classification under the Equal\nProtection Clause.” (emphasis added)); State v. Davis, 504\nN.W.2d 767, 771 (Minn. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1115\n(1994); Casarez v. State, 913 S.W.2d 468 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1994).\n\n\n\n                                  42\n\fheightened equal-protection review. Before turning more\nfully to our reasoning, however, we pause to reiterate that the\nterm “heightened scrutiny,” as we use it, encompasses both\n“intermediate scrutiny” and “strict scrutiny.” Because the\nCity bears the burden of production and proof with respect to\nboth, see infra Part IV(A)(2), we need not—and should\nnot12—determine in connection with its motion to dismiss\nwhich of the two applies, and we leave that question for the\nDistrict Court in the first instance when and if it becomes\nnecessary to decide it.\n       In designating a particular classification as “suspect”\nor “quasi-suspect” under the Equal Protection Clause, the\nSupreme Court generally considers a variety of factors\n“grouped around [the] central idea” of “whether the\ndiscrimination embodies a gross unfairness that is [so]\nsufficiently inconsistent with the ideals of equal protection to\nterm it ‘invidious.’” Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699,\n724–25 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc) (Norris, J., concurring in the\n\n\n12\n  Ashwander v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring) (“It is not the habit of the court to\ndecide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely\nnecessary to a decision of the case.” (quoting Burton v.\nUnited States, 196 U.S. 283, 295 (1905))); Liverpool, N.Y. &\nPhila. S.S. Co. v. Comm’rs of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39\n(1885) (“In the exercise of [its] jurisdiction, [the Court\nmust] . . . never . . . formulate a rule of constitutional law\nbroader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to\nbe applied.”); Ala. State Fed’n of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.S.\n450, 461 (1945) (“It has long been [the Court’s] considered\npractice not . . . to decide any constitutional question in\nadvance of the necessity for its decision.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                  43\n\fjudgment). Among these are “whether the . . . class is defined\nby a[n] [immutable] trait that ‘frequently bears no relation to\nability to perform or contribute to society’” and “whether the\nclass has been saddled with unique disabilities because of\nprejudice or inaccurate stereotypes.” Id. at 725 (quoting\nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality\nopinion)). But while these factors are those most often\nconsidered, “[n]o single talisman can define those groups\nlikely to be the target of classifications offensive to the\nFourteenth Amendment . . . ; experience, not abstract logic,\nmust be the primary guide.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\nLiving Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 472 n.24 (1985) (Marshall, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n        Courts first have looked with particular suspicion on\ndiscrimination based on “immutable human attributes.”\nParham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 351 (1979) (plurality\nopinion). Accordingly, a classification is more likely to\nreceive heightened scrutiny if it discriminates against\nindividuals based on a characteristic that they either cannot\nrealistically change or ought not be compelled to change\nbecause it is fundamental to their identities. See, e.g., Baskin\nv. Bogan, 766 F.3d 648, 655 (7th Cir. 2014) (Posner, J.)\n(framing this issue as whether “the unequal treatment [is]\nbased on some immutable or at least tenacious characteristic\nof the people discriminated against” as opposed to a\n“characteristic[] that [is] easy for a person to change, such as\nthe length of his or her fingernails”); Watkins, 875 F.2d at 726\n(Norris, J., concurring in the judgment) (“[T]he Supreme\nCourt is willing to treat a trait as effectively immutable if\nchanging it would involve great difficulty, such as requiring a\nmajor physical change or a traumatic change of identity.”).\n       Religious affiliation falls within this category. As we\n\n\n\n\n                                  44\n\fhave recognized in the immigration context,13 religious\naffiliation is typically seen as “capable of being changed,” yet\n“of such fundamental importance that individuals should not\nbe required to modify it.”14 Ghebrehiwot v. Attorney Gen. of\nU.S., 467 F.3d 344, 357 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting Escobar v.\nGonzalez, 417 F.3d 363, 367 (3d Cir. 2005)); see also Baskin,\n766 F.3d at 655 (Posner, J.) (listing “religion” as an example\nof “a deep psychological commitment” that would qualify for\n\n\n13\n   Other courts have drawn on the definition of “immutable”\nin immigration cases when defining the term in the context of\nan equal-protection suit. Latta v. Otter, 771 F.3d 456, 464 n.4\n(9th Cir. 2014) (quoting an immigration case for the\nproposition that “[s]exual orientation and sexual identity are\nimmutable; they are so fundamental to one’s identity that a\nperson should not be required to abandon them” (alteration in\noriginal)), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 2931 (2015).\n14\n   Aziz Z. Huq, The Signaling Function of Religious Speech\nin Domestic Counterterrorism, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 833, 852\n(2011) (recognizing that religion lies “at the core of many\nindividuals’ understanding of their identity”); David B.\nSalmons, Comment, Toward a Fuller Understanding of\nReligious Exercise: Recognizing the Identity-Generative and\nExpressive Nature of Religious Devotion, 62 U. Chi. L. Rev.\n1243, 1258 (1995) (noting the “fundamental role [that\nreligious preference] play[s] in shaping an individual’s\nconcept of identity and personhood”); Note, Reinterpreting\nthe Religion Clauses: Constitutional Construction and\nConceptions of the Self, 97 Harv.

Rev. 1468, 1474 (1984)\n(“A society that failed to protect religion would foreclose the\nindividual’s choice of the most fundamental part of his\nidentity.”).\n\n\n\n                                  45\n\fheightened scrutiny). Moreover, while some immutable\ncharacteristics, such as intellectual disability, are so often\ncorrelated with “a person’s ability to participate in society”\nthat we frequently deem them to be constitutionally\npermissible bases for discrimination, see Baskin, 766 F.3d at\n655, a person’s religious affiliation is at the other end of that\nspectrum.\n       Religious discrimination, “by [its] very nature,” has\nlong been thought “odious to a free people whose institutions\nare founded upon the doctrine of equality.” Bell v. Maryland,\n378 U.S. 226, 288 (1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring) (quoting\nHirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943)); W.\nVa. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 653 (1943)\n(“[For]        Jefferson    and       those      who      followed\nhim[,] . . . [r]eligious minorities as well as religious majorities\nwere to be equal in the eyes of the political state.”); President\nJames Madison, Religious Freedom: A Memorial and\nRemonstrance Against the General Assessment, in “A Bill\nEstablishing Provision for the Teachers of the Christian\nReligion,” Presented to the General Assembly of Virginia, at\nthe Session of 1785 (1819) (“A just Government . . . will be\nbest supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of\nhis Religion with the same equal hand which protects his\nperson and his property; by neither invading the equal rights\nof any Sect, nor suffering any sect to invade those of\nanother.”).\n       Courts also are more likely to subject classifications\nthat are “closely associated with inequality” to a more\nsearching inquiry. Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169,\n1996 (2d Cir. 2012), aff’d on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. 2675\n(2013). Thus, if the classification is accompanied by a\nhistory of “discrimination based on archaic and overbroad\nassumptions,” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 625\n(1984), or if it has been traditionally used as a tool for the\n\n\n\n\n                                   46\n\foppression and subordination of minority groups, see, e.g.,\nCity of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 495–96\n(1989) (plurality opinion), heightened scrutiny often is more\nappropriately applied.\n       The history of religious discrimination in the United\nStates is intertwined with that based on other protected\ncharacteristics, including national origin and race.15 Saint\nFrancis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 611–12 (1987)\n(noting that “[t]he Ninth edition of the Encyclopedia\nBritannica . . . referred to Arabs, Jews, and other ethnic\ngroups such as Germans, Hungarians, and Greeks, as separate\nraces” (citations omitted)); Fong Yue Ting v. United States,\n149 U.S. 698, 717 (1893) (referring to “Chinese laborers” as\n\n\n15\n    Indeed, the close relationship among race, religion,\nethnicity, and national origin is reflected by the allegations in\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 40 (“In addition to\ntargeting Muslims by focusing on mosques, Muslim-owned\nbusinesses, and other Muslim-associated organizations as\nsubjects of surveillance, the Program also intentionally targets\nMuslims by using ethnicity as a proxy for faith.”); id. ¶ 41\n(“As part of the Program, the Department has designated\ntwenty-eight countries and ‘American Black Muslim’ as\n‘ancestries of interest.’”); id. ¶ 53 (“To facilitate future\nsurveillance of entire American Muslim communities, the\nNYPD has created maps indicating the locations of mosques,\nrestaurants, retail establishments, and schools owned by or\nserving Muslims, as well as ethnic populations from heavily\nMuslim countries.”); id. ¶ 55 (“The NYPD also inspects\nrecords of name changes and compiles databases of new\nMuslim converts who take Arabic names, as well as Muslims\nwho take names that are perceived to be ‘Western.’”).\n\n\n\n                                  47\n\f“of a distinct race and religion”); In re Halladjian, 174 F.\n834, 838 (C.C.D. Mass. 1909) (“A Hindoo . . . differs in color\nno less from a Chinaman than from an Anglo-Saxon . . . .”);\nKhaled A. Beydoun, Between Muslim and White: The Legal\nConstruction of Arab American Identity, 69 N.Y.U. Ann.\nSurv. Am. L. 29, 33 (2013) (noting that “the conflation of\nArab and Muslim identity was deeply entrenched within the\ncourts during the Naturalization Era” and that “Islam was\ntreated as an ethno-racial identity”).\n        It is thus unsurprising that tampering with religious\naffiliation brings into play the same concerns of inequality.\nThough “[n]othing but the most telling of personal\nexperiences in religious persecution suffered by our forebears\ncould have planted our belief in liberty of religious opinion\nany more deeply in our heritage,” Schempp, 374 U.S. at 214\n(citation omitted), we have struggled to guarantee religious\nequality since our Nation’s founding. See generally Everson\nv. Bd. of Educ. of Ewing Twp., 330 U.S. 1, 9–10 (1947);\nShaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S. 615, 616\n(1987); Schware v. Bd. of Bar Exam’rs of N.M., 353 U.S. 232,\n236 (1957); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 109\n(1943). Different religious groups have borne the brunt of\nmajority oppression during different times, and the battle\nagainst religious prejudice continues. See, e.g., U.S. Patriot\nAct of 2001, Pub. L. 107-56, § 102(a)(3), 115 Stat. 274 (“The\nacts of violence that have been taken against Arab and\nMuslim Americans since the September 11, 2001, attacks\nagainst the United States should be and are condemned by all\nAmericans who value freedom.”); Brief in Support of\nAppellants by Amici Curiae the Asian American Legal\nDefense & Education Fund & 17 Other Non-Governmental\nOrganizations Supporting Civil Rights for American\nMuslims 11–22.\n      In light of this history, distinctions between citizens on\n\n\n\n\n                                 48\n\freligious grounds pose a particularly acute “danger of stigma\nand stirred animosities.” Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Vill.\nSch. Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 728 (1994) (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment); see also Wright v. Rockefeller,\n376 U.S. 52, 67 (1964) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (“When\nracial or religious lines are drawn by the State, the\nmultiracial, multireligious communities that our Constitution\nseeks to weld together as one become separatist; antagonisms\nthat relate to race or to religion . . . are generated . . . .”); Kunz\nv. New York, 340 U.S. 290, 313 (1951) (Jackson, J.,\ndissenting) (“If any two subjects are intrinsically incendiary\nand divisive, they are race and religion.”). That “[c]enturies\nof experience testify that laws aimed at one . . . religious\ngroup . . . generate hatreds and prejudices which rapidly\nspread beyond control,” Am. Commc’ns Ass’n, C.I.O. v.\nDouds, 339 U.S. 382, 448 (1950) (Black, J., dissenting), also\ncounsels in favor of heightened scrutiny.\n\n       A final relevant consideration is whether the\nLegislative and Executive Branches have concluded that a\nform of discrimination is inherently invidious. In holding\ngender to be a “quasi-suspect” classification deserving of\nintermediate scrutiny, the Supreme Court noted, for instance,\nin Frontiero that, because Congress is “a coequal branch of\nGovernment,” its “conclu[sion] that classifications based\nupon sex are inherently invidious . . . [was] not without\nsignificance to the question [then] under consideration.” 411\nU.S. at 687–88.\n       Many of the same statutes that foreclose sex-based\ndiscrimination, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 cited by the Frontiero Court, see id. at 687, also forbid\nreligious discrimination. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2\n(making it an “unlawful employment practice” for an\nemployer to discriminate based on “race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin”). And from the passage of the Civil Rights\n\n\n\n\n                                     49\n\fAct of 1875,16 to those designed to strengthen national\nsecurity in our post-September 11 world,17 that commitment\nto the “sacrosanct . . . concept” of equality among “all\nreligious . . . groups,”  see    U.S.    Patriot     Act     of\n2001§ 102(a)(3), is embodied throughout the U.S. Code. See,\ne.g., 2 U.S.C. § 1311(a) (employment); 12 U.S.C.\n§ 3106a(1)(B), (2)(B) (banking); 12 U.S.C. § 4545 (fair\nhousing); 22 U.S.C. § 2504(a) (Peace Corps service); 49\nU.S.C. § 40127 (air transportation and use of private airports).\n       The same commitment to religious equality is seen in\nthe pronouncements of the Executive Branch, from those of\nour first President, George Washington, to our current\nPresident, Barack Obama. See, e.g., President George\nWashington, Address to the Members of the New Church in\nBaltimore (Jan. 1793), in 2 Jared Sparks, Life of George\nWashington Commander-in-Chief of the American Armies: to\nWhich Are Added, His Diaries and Speeches; and Various\n\n\n\n16\n   Act of Mar. 1, 1875, ch. 114, 18 Stat. 335 (“[I]t is essential\nto just government we recognize the equality of all men\nbefore the law, and hold that it is the duty of government in\nits dealings with the people to mete out equal and exact\njustice to all, of whatever nativity, race, color, or persuasion,\nreligious or political . . . .”).\n17\n    See, e.g., U.S. Patriot Act of 2001, Pub. L. 107-56,\n§ 102(a)(3), b(3), 115 Stat. 274 (“The concept of individual\nresponsibility for wrongdoing is sacrosanct in American\nsociety, and applies equally to all religious, racial, and ethnic\ngroups. . . . [T]he Nation is called upon to recognize the\npatriotism of fellow citizens from all ethnic, racial, and\nreligious backgrounds.”).\n\n\n\n                                  50\n\fMiscellaneous Papers Relating to His Habits & Opinions\n314, 314–15 (1839) (“In this enlightened age, and in this land\nof equal liberty, it is our boast that a man’s religious tenets\nwill not forfeit the protection of the laws, nor deprive him of\nthe right of attaining and holding the highest offices that are\nknown in the United States.”); President Harry Truman,\nSpecial Message to the Congress on Civil Rights (Feb. 2,\n1948) (“Racial, religious and other invidious forms of\ndiscrimination deprive the individual of an equal chance to\ndevelop and utilize his talents and to enjoy the rewards of his\nefforts.”); President Theodore Roosevelt, Sixth Annual\nMessage to Congress (Dec. 3, 1906) (“[W]e must treat with\njustice and good will all immigrants who come here under the\nlaw[,] . . . [w]hether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or\nGentile . . . .”); President Barack Obama, State of the Union\nAddress (Jan. 28, 2014) (“[W]e believe in the inherent dignity\nand equality of every human being, regardless of race or\nreligion, creed or sexual orientation.”).\n       For these reasons, we conclude that classifications on\nthe basis of religious affiliation are subject to heightened\nscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.\n                    ii.    Evaluation of Means and Ends\n        The final step in evaluating an equal-protection claim\nis to examine the challenged action’s “means” and “ends” and\nthe “fit” between the two. The specific analysis differs\ndepending on the level of scrutiny that applies. The higher\nthe scrutiny required, the more persuasive must be the\ngovernmental objective and the snugger the means-ends fit.\nThus, while it usually matters little for purposes of rational-\nbasis review that a governmental interest is not exceedingly\nimportant or that “other means are better suited to the\nachievement of governmental ends,” heightened scrutiny\ndemands a much stronger justification and a much tighter\n\n\n\n\n                                 51\n\frelationship “between the means employed and the ends\nserved.” Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 77–78 (2001)\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting).\n       Also increasingly demanding is the standard of proof.\nWhile the rational-basis standard usually puts the burden of\nproof on the classification’s opponent and “permits a court to\nhypothesize interests that might support [the governmental]\ndistinctions,” id. at 77 (emphasis added) (citing Heller v. Doe,\n509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993); R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 155\n(1980)), the burden of justification under both intermediate\nand strict scrutiny “is demanding and . . . rests entirely on the\nState,” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).\nSee also Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 (discussing the standard and\nburden for intermediate scrutiny); Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at\nAustin, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2419 (2013) (strict scrutiny).\n       Here, the City argues that “[a] comprehensive\nunderstanding of the makeup of the community would help\nthe NYPD figure out where to look—and where not to look—\nin the event it received information that an Islamist\nradicalized to violence may be secreting himself in New\nJersey.” City Br. 50. It even goes so far as to assert that “it\nwould be irresponsible for the NYPD not to have an\nunderstanding of the varied mosaic that is the Muslim\ncommunity to respond to such threats.” Id. (emphasis added).\nBut because heightened scrutiny applies in this case, we\ncannot accept the City’s invitation to dismiss Plaintiffs’\nComplaint based on its assurance that the Program is justified\nby national-security and public-safety concerns. Rather, the\nburden of producing evidence to overcome heightened\nscrutiny’s presumption of unconstitutionality is that of the\nCity, cf. Aiken v. City of Memphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1163 (6th\nCir. 1994) (en banc) (“When, as here, a race-based\naffirmative action plan is subjected to strict scrutiny, the party\ndefending the plan bears the burden of producing evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\fthat the plan is constitutional.”), and must be met after its\nMotion to Dismiss.\n\n       To be clear, we acknowledge that a principal reason\nfor a government’s existence is to provide security. But while\nwe do not question the legitimacy of the City’s interest, “[t]he\ngravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of questions\nconcerning what means law enforcement officers may employ\nto pursue a given purpose.” City of Indianapolis v. Edmond,\n531 U.S. 32, 42 (2000). Rather, heightened scrutiny requires\nthat the relationship between the asserted justification and\ndiscriminatory means employed “be substantiated by\nobjective evidence.” Patrolmen’s Benevolent Ass’n of New\nYork v. City of New York, 310 F.3d 43, 53 (2d Cir. 2002).\n“[M]ere speculation or conjecture is insufficient,” id., as are\nappeals to “‘common sense’ which might be inflected by\nstereotypes,” Reynolds v. City of Chicago, 296 F.3d 524, 526\n(7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.). See also Lomack v. City of\nNewark, 463 F.3d 303, 310 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing with\napproval Patrolmen’s Benevolent Ass’n, 310 F.3d at 52–53).\n       And “[e]ven in the limited circumstance” where a\nsuspect or quasi-suspect classification “is permissible to\nfurther [an important or] compelling state interest, the\ngovernment is still ‘constrained in how it may pursue that\nend.’” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 333 (2003)\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517\nU.S. 899, 908 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)). While “[a] classification does not fail rational-\nbasis review because it is not made with mathematical nicety\nor because in practice it results in some inequality,” Heller,\n509 U.S. at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted), strict\nscrutiny requires that “the classification at issue . . . ‘fit’ with\ngreater precision than any alternative means,” Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 280 n.6 (1986) (plurality\nopinion) (citing John Hart Ely, The Constitutionality of\n\n\n\n\n                                    53\n\fReverse Racial Discrimination, 41 U. Chi. L. Rev. 723, 727\nn.26 (1974)). Intermediate scrutiny falls somewhere in\nbetween the two, asking if there is a “direct, substantial\nrelationship between objective and means.” Hogan, 458 U.S.\nat 725.\n       No matter how tempting it might be to do otherwise,\nwe must apply the same rigorous standards even where\nnational security is at stake. We have learned from\nexperience that it is often where the asserted interest appears\nmost compelling that we must be most vigilant in protecting\nconstitutional rights. “[H]istory teaches that grave threats to\nliberty often come in times of urgency, when constitutional\nrights seem too extravagant to endure.” Skinner v. Ry. Labor\nExecs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 635 (1989) (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting); see also Grutter, 539 U.S. at 351 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The lesson of\nKorematsu [v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 223 (1944)] is\nthat national security constitutes a ‘pressing public necessity,’\nthough the government’s use of [a suspect classification] to\nadvance that objective must be [appropriately] tailored.”);\nSkinner, 489 U.S. at 635 (Marshall, J. dissenting) (“The\nWorld War II relocation-camp cases and the Red scare and\nMcCarthy-era internal subversion cases are only the most\nextreme reminders that when we allow fundamental freedoms\nto be sacrificed in the name of real or perceived exigency, we\ninvariably come to regret it.” (citations omitted)).\n       Today it is acknowledged, for instance, that the F.D.R.\nAdministration and military authorities infringed the\nconstitutional rights of Japanese-Americans during World\nWar II by placing them under curfew and removing them\nfrom their West Coast homes and into internment camps. Yet\nwhen these citizens pleaded with the courts to uphold their\nconstitutional rights, we passively accepted the Government’s\nrepresentations that the use of such classifications was\n\n\n\n\n                                  54\n\fnecessary to the national interest. Hirabayashi, 320 U.S. 81;\nKorematsu, 323 U.S. 214. In doing so, we failed to recognize\nthat the discriminatory treatment of approximately 120,000\npersons of Japanese ancestry was fueled not by military\nnecessity but unfounded fears. See United States v. Hohri,\n482 U.S. 64, 66 (1987); see also Act to Implement\nRecommendations on the Commission of Wartime Relocation\nand Internment of Civilians, Pub. L. 100-383, § 2(a), 102\nStat. 903-04 (1988). Given that “unconditional deference to\n[the] government[’s] . . . invocation of ‘emergency’ . . . has a\nlamentable place in our history,” Patrolmen’s Benevolent\nAss’n, 310 F.3d at 53–54 (citing Korematsu, 323 U.S. at 223),\nthe past should not preface yet again bending our\nconstitutional principles merely because an interest in\nnational security is invoked.\n       In sum, because Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that\nthe City engaged in intentional discrimination against a\nprotected class, and because that classification creates a\npresumption of unconstitutionality that remains the City’s\nobligation to rebut, Plaintiffs have stated a claim under the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       B.     First-Amendment Claims\n       We finally reach Plaintiffs’ claims under the Religion\nClauses of the First Amendment. They allege violations of\nboth the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,\nwhich respectively prohibit the making of any “law\nrespecting an establishment of religion” or “prohibiting the\nfree exercise thereof.” U.S. Const. Amend. I.\n       Plaintiffs bring both claims under the theory that the\nFirst Amendment demands strict governmental neutrality\namong religious sects.         While it is intuitive that\ndiscriminatory conduct that inhibits a person’s full religious\n\n\n\n\n                                  55\n\fexpression may run afoul of the Free Exercise Clause of the\nFirst Amendment, under the facts here the same is\ncounterintuitive for the Establishment Clause, as the latter\n“tend[s] to [involve] challenge[s] to governmental\nendorsement.” Catholic League for Religious & Civil Rights\nv. City of San Francisco, 624 F.3d 1043, 1050 n.20 (9th Cir.\n2010) (en banc) (emphasis added). But see Colo. Christian\nUniv. v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245, 1266 (10th Cir. 2008)\n(McConnell, J.) (“[S]tatutes involving discrimination on the\nbasis     of    religion,    including    interdenominational\ndiscrimination, are subject to heightened scrutiny whether\nthey arise under the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment\nClause, or the Equal Protection Clause . . . .” (citations\nomitted)). However, a full discussion of either Religion\nClause and its application to our case is unnecessary, as we\nconfine ourselves to the City’s arguments raised in its Motion\nto Dismiss. Those arguments are unpersuasive.\n\n        The City first argues that, “according to a three month\nfact finding investigation by the New Jersey Attorney\nGeneral, the surveillance Program did not violate New Jersey\ncivil or criminal law.” City Br. 44. That this argument could\ndefeat a federal constitutional claim, let alone on a motion to\ndismiss, borders on the frivolous. Aside from a court’s\ninability to consider such matters extraneous to the pleadings\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), it is the\nUnited States Constitution—not the “civil or criminal law” of\nNew Jersey—that Plaintiffs seek to enforce. But even more\nfundamentally, the New Jersey Attorney General’s legal\nconclusion is not helpful in determining whether the City\nviolated Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. “It is emphatically\nthe province and duty of the judicial department”—not the\nNew Jersey executive—“to say what the law is.” Marbury v.\nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803).\n      The City’s only other argument (aside from a few\n\n\n\n\n                                 56\n\fscattered citations to free-speech and privacy cases that have\nlittle application to Plaintiffs’ religion claims) is buried in a\nfootnote in its brief amidst a discussion of the Equal\nProtection Clause:\n       [Plaintiffs have also failed to] allege[] a\n       classification that violates the Free Exercise and\n       Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment\n       because such claims [similarly] require a\n       showing of discriminatory purpose.             See\n       Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of\n       Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 540 (1993) (“Here, as in\n       equal protection cases, we may determine the\n       city council’s object from both direct and\n       circumstantial evidence.”)) [sic]; Lemon v.\n       Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612–13 (1971) (in\n       order to survive an Establishment Clause\n       challenge, the government practice must\n       (1) have a secular purpose, (2) have a primary\n       effect that neither advances nor inhibits\n       religion, and (3) not foster excessive state\n       entanglement with religion).\nCity Br. 58 n.20 (emphasis added). A sentence-long\nargument buried in a footnote is hardly a satisfactory way to\ntackle two of the most jurisprudentially challenging and\nnuanced areas of our law. Schempp, 374 U.S. at 246\n(Brennan, J., concurring) (noting “the difficulty . . . endemic\nto issues implicating the religious guarantees of the First\nAmendment”); Robinson v. City of Edmond, 160 F.3d 1275,\n1282 (10th Cir. 1998) (recognizing that the Establishment\nClause is “an area notorious for its difficult case law”);\nHarris v. City of Zion, 927 F.2d 1401, 1410–11 (7th Cir.\n1991) (“[C]ases arising under the Religion Clauses of the\n[F]irst [A]mendment have presented some of the most\nperplexing questions in constitutional law.”). We therefore\n\n\n\n\n                                  57\n\fconsider this argument waived. John Wyeth & Brother Ltd. v.\nCIGNA Int’l Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(Alito, J.) (“[A]rguments raised in passing (such as in a\nfootnote), but not squarely argued, are considered waived.”).\n        But even if we were to consider the City’s halfhearted\nassertion that allegations of overt hostility and prejudice are\nrequired to make out claims under the First Amendment, this\nargument would easily fail, just as did the identical argument\nwith respect to the Equal Protection Clause. While the\ncontours of neither the Free Exercise nor the Establishment\nClause are static and well defined, courts have repeatedly\nrejected the notion that either Clause “is . . . confined to\nactions based on animus.” Laurence H. Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law §§ 5–16, at 956 (3d ed. 2000) (“[A] law\nthat is not neutral or that is not generally applicable can\nviolate the Free Exercise Clause without regard to the motives\nof those who enacted the measure.”); see also Shrum v. City\nof Coweta, 449 F.3d 1132, 1144–45 (10th Cir. 2006)\n(McConnell, J.) (“Proof of hostility or discriminatory\nmotivation may be sufficient to prove that a challenged\ngovernmental action is not neutral, but the Free Exercise\nClause is not confined to actions based on animus.” (citations\nomitted)); Allen v. Morton, 495 F.2d 65, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1973)\n(Tamm, J., concurring) (noting that, under the Establishment\nClause, “good motives cannot save impermissible actions”).\nAt bottom, the City needs something other than this\nthreadbare argument based on the absence of subjective\nhostility to avoid a non-swinging strikeout.\nV.    CONCLUSION\n       The allegations in Plaintiffs’ Complaint tell a story in\nwhich there is standing to complain and which present\nconstitutional concerns that must be addressed and, if true,\nredressed. Our job is judicial. We “can apply only law, and\n\n\n\n\n                                 58\n\fmust abide by the Constitution, or [we] cease to be civil\ncourts and become instruments of [police] policy.”\nKorematsu, 323 U.S. at 247 (Jackson, J., dissenting).\n       We believe that statement of Justice Jackson to be on\nthe right side of history, and for a majority of us in quiet\ntimes it remains so . . . until the next time there is the fear of a\nfew who cannot be sorted out easily from the many. Even\nwhen we narrow the many to a class or group, that\nnarrowing—here to those affiliated with a major worldwide\nreligion—is not near enough under our Constitution. “[T]o\ninfer that examples of individual disloyalty prove group\ndisloyalty and justify discriminatory action against the entire\ngroup is to deny that under our system of law individual guilt\nis the sole basis for deprivation of rights.” Id. at 240\n(Murphy, J., dissenting).\n       What occurs here in one guise is not new. We have\nbeen down similar roads before. Jewish-Americans during\nthe Red Scare, African-Americans during the Civil Rights\nMovement, and Japanese-Americans during World War II are\nexamples that readily spring to mind. We are left to wonder\nwhy we cannot see with foresight what we see so clearly with\nhindsight—that “[l]oyalty is a matter of the heart and mind[,]\nnot race, creed, or color.” Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 323 U.S.\n283, 302 (1944).\n       We reverse and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    59\n\fROTH, Circuit Judge, concurrence.\n\n        I agree that plaintiffs have demonstrated standing and\nmade sufficient allegations of violations of equal-protection\nrights.. I differ from the majority in its failure to determine\nwhether “intermediate scrutiny” or “strict scrutiny” applies\nhere. In our determinations so far, we have also, I believe,\nmade the findings necessary to resolve the issue of the\nappropriate level of scrutiny.\n\n       In my opinion, “intermediate scrutiny” is appropriate\nhere. I say this because “intermediate scrutiny” is the level\napplied in gender discrimination cases. I have the immutable\ncharacteristic of being a woman. I am happy with this\ncondition, but during my 80 years on this earth, it has caused\nme at times to suffer gender discrimination. My remedy now\nfor any future gender discrimination would be reviewed with\n“intermediate scrutiny.” For that reason, I cannot endorse a\nlevel of scrutiny in other types of discrimination cases that\nwould be stricter than the level which would apply to\ndiscrimination against me as a woman.\n\n\n\n\n                              1\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their civil-rights suit\nagainst the City of New York (the “City”). They claim to be\ntargets of a wide-ranging surveillance program that the New\nYork City Police Department (the “NYPD”) began in the\nwake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (the\n“Program”). Plaintiffs allege that the Program is based on the\nfalse and stigmatizing premise that Muslim religious identity\n“is a permissible proxy for criminality, and that Muslim\nindividuals, businesses, and institutions can therefore be\nsubject to pervasive surveillance not visited upon individuals,\nbusinesses, and institutions of any other religious faith or the\npublic at large.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 6 (the “Complaint” or\n“Compl.”). They bring this lawsuit “to affirm the principle\nthat individuals may not be singled out for intrusive\ninvestigation and pervasive surveillance that cause them\ncontinuing harm simply because they profess a certain\nfaith.” Id. ¶ 8.\n\n        In its narrowest form, this appeal raises two questions:\nDo      Plaintiffs—themselves allegedly subject to a\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fdiscriminatory surveillance program—have standing to sue in\nfederal court to vindicate their religious-liberty and equal-\nprotection rights? If so, taking Plaintiffs’ non-conclusory\nallegations as true, have they stated valid claims under the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to our Constitution? Both\nof these questions, which we answer yes, seem\nstraightforward enough.      Lurking beneath the surface,\nhowever, are questions about equality, religious liberty, the\nrole of courts in safeguarding our Constitution, and the\nprotection of our civil liberties and rights equally during\nwartime and in peace.\n\nII.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.     Plaintiffs’ Allegations\n        Lead Plaintiff Syed Faraj Hassan and others of or\nassociated with the Islamic faith (collectively “Plaintiffs”)\nassert that, since January 2002, the City has through the\nNYPD conducted the Program in secret “to monitor the lives\nof Muslims, their businesses, houses of worship,\norganizations, and schools in New York City and surrounding\nstates, particularly New Jersey.” See Pls.’ Br. 2 (citing\nCompl. ¶¶ 36, 38). As this case comes before us on the City’s\nMotion to Dismiss, we must take all facts alleged in\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint as true and draw all reasonable\ninferences that arise therefrom in their favor. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6).\n              1.     The Program\n        Plaintiffs contend that the NYPD launched the\nProgram following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks\nwith the goal of “infiltra[ting] and monitor[ing] Muslim life\nin and around New York City.” Compl. ¶ 2. They claim that\nit “target[s] Muslim entities and individuals in New Jersey for\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\finvestigation solely because they are Muslim or believed to\nbe Muslim” rather than “based upon evidence of\nwrongdoing.” Id. ¶¶ 7, 47. Plaintiffs claim that the Program,\ngoing on its tenth year when the Complaint was filed, “has\nnever generated a single lead.” Id. ¶ 2.\n        Per the Complaint, the NYPD “uses a variety of\nmethods to spy on Muslims.” Id. ¶ 39. Among the\ntechniques that it employs are to “snap pictures, take video,\nand collect license plate numbers of [mosque] congregants”\nand to “mount surveillance cameras on light poles, aimed at\nmosques,”       which    “[o]fficers can     [then] control\n[remotely] . . . with their computers” and which generate\nfootage used “to help identify worshippers.” Id. ¶ 46.\nPlaintiffs also allege the NYPD sends “undercover\nofficers”—some of which are called “mosque crawlers” and\n“rakers”—into mosques, student organizations, businesses,\nand neighborhoods that “it believes to be heavily Muslim.”\nId. ¶¶ 47, 49–50.          By “monitor[ing] sermons and\nconversations in mosques” and “surveil[ling] locations such\nas bookstores, bars, cafes, and nightclubs,” officers\n“document[] . . . American Muslim life” in “painstaking\ndetail[]” and “report back to the NYPD.” Id. ¶ 47.\n        While Plaintiffs believe that some of this surveillance\nactivity is passive (such as “tak[ing] video and photographs at\nmosques, Muslim-owned businesses, and schools,” id. ¶ 39,\nand recording “the subject of conversations overheard at\nmosques,” id. ¶ 47), in other cases NYPD officers more\nactively engage with the persons monitored. One alleged\nspying method of the latter type is to “sen[d] undercover\nofficers to [Muslim-affiliated] locations to engage in\npretextual conversations to elicit information from proprietors\nand patrons.” Id. ¶ 39. Officers also “sometimes pose” as\nmembers of certain groups and organizations under\ninvestigation. Id. ¶ 50. The Complaint illustrates one such\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\fexample where an NYPD “officer . . . went on a rafting trip\nwith a[] [Muslim Students Association (MSA)] and\nmonitored and recorded how often the student participants on\nthe trip prayed” and their “discuss[ion of] religious\ntopics.” Id.\n       Not only does the alleged Program “utilize[] numerous\nforms of surveillance,” id. ¶ 45, but that surveillance is also\nwidespread. Plaintiffs claim, for instance, that the NYPD\n“has strived to have an informant inside every mosque within\na 250-mile radius of New York City” and has “place[d]\ninformants or undercover officers in all or virtually all\nMSAs” at “colleges and universities in New York, New\nJersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania . . . without any\nindication whatsoever of criminal activity or any connection\nwhatsoever to wrongdoing.” Id. ¶¶ 47, 49. In all, the NYPD\nhas allegedly “surveill[ed] . . . at least twenty mosques,\nfourteen restaurants, eleven retail stores, two grade schools\nand two [MSAs], in addition to an untold number of\nindividuals who own, operate, and visit those\nestablishments.” Id. ¶ 3.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that, in addition to singling out\norganizations and businesses for surveillance that in some\nway are visibly or openly affiliated with Islam (such as\nmosques or businesses with prayer mats or other Islamic\nidentifications), “the Program also intentionally targets\nMuslims by using ethnicity as a proxy for faith.” Id. ¶ 40.\nPlaintiffs aver, for instance, that the NYPD “has designated\ntwenty-eight countries . . . constitut[ing] about 80% of the\nworld’s Muslim population” and “American Black Muslim”\nas “ancestries of interest.” Id. ¶ 41. But the Program is still\ndecidedly focused on religion. Thus, rather than “surveil all\npeople and establishments with ‘ancestries of interest,’” the\nNYPD “expressly chooses to exclude people and\nestablishments with such ‘ancestries’ if they are not Muslim.”\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fId. ¶ 42. This includes “Egyptians if they are Coptic\nChristians, Syrians if they are Jewish, or Albanians if they are\nCatholic or Orthodox Christian.” Id. Conversely, Plaintiffs\nclaim that the NYPD has examined other immigrant\ncommunities in Newark, New Jersey “for the presence of\nMuslims,” such as the “Portuguese and Brazilian immigrant\ncommunities” notwithstanding that “Portugal and Brazil\n[are] . . . not found on [the NYPD’s] list of twenty-eight\n‘ancestries.’” Id. ¶ 44.\n              2.     Reports and Informational Databases\n       Plaintiffs allege that the Program has resulted in “a\nseries of reports documenting in detail the information\nobtained from [the NYPD’s] surveillance of New Jersey\nMuslim communities.” Id. ¶ 5. These “includ[e] a report\nfocusing on the Muslim community in Newark” (the “Newark\nreport”), id.; “more than twenty precinct-level maps of the\nCity of Newark, noting the location of mosques and Muslim\nbusinesses and the ethnic composition of the Muslim\ncommunity,” id. ¶ 3; “analytical report[s] on every mosque\nwithin 100 miles” of New York City, id. ¶ 47; and a weekly\n“MSA Report on schools, including reports on Rutgers New\nBrunswick and Rutgers Newark,” id. ¶ 51.\n       The information and records collected and compiled\nare extensive and varied.                  Among these are\n“pictures, . . . video, . . . and license plate numbers of\n[mosque] congregants,” id. ¶ 46; intelligence about “where\nreligious schools are located,” id. ¶ 47; indications of\nreligious affiliation and Muslim patronage of shops,\nrestaurants, and grocery stores, id.; lists of “businesses owned\nor frequented by Muslims,” id.; and “names of professors,\nscholars, and students” affiliated with MSAs, id. ¶ 51. The\nCity also allegedly “compiles databases of new Muslim\nconverts who take Arabic names, as well as Muslims who\n\n\n\n\n                                  13\n\ftake names that are perceived to be ‘Western.’” Id. ¶ 55.\n        Besides names and other identifying information of\nindividuals, businesses, and organizations, the NYPD reports\ninclude seemingly mundane and innocuous details about\nMuslim community life in New Jersey, such as: (1) “flyers\nare posted in shops advertising for Quran tutoring;” (2) “a\npicture of a mosque hangs in a grocery store;” (3) “a\nrestaurant serves ‘religious Muslims;’” (4) “customers visit a\nDunkin’ Donuts after Friday prayer;” (5) “a restaurant is\nlocated near a particular mosque;” (6) “employees or\ncustomers of establishments are observed wearing ‘traditional\nclothing;’” (7) “Muslim prayer mats are hanging on the wall\nat an Indian restaurant;” and (8) “a store posts a sign that it\nwill be closed on Friday in observance of Friday prayer.” Id.\n¶ 47. Finally, NYPD officers have compiled “the subject[s\nand details] of conversations overheard at mosques.” Id. In\none 2006 report, for instance, they “document[ed] twenty-\nthree conversations at twenty mosques,” though “[n]one of\nthe information collected showed any indication of criminal\nactivity.” Id.\n             3.     Fall-Out from the Program’s Disclosure\n                    to the Public\n       Plaintiffs claim that, despite “initial secrecy,” public\nknowledge of the alleged Program’s existence “has become\nwidespread in New Jersey and elsewhere.” Id. ¶ 45. They\nalso contend that a number of the allegedly generated reports\n“ha[ve] been widely publicized,” id. ¶ 20, and that each\nPlaintiff has been “either specifically named in an NYPD\nspying report or is a member of at least one mosque or other\nassociation named in such a report,” Pls.’ Br. 21 (citing\nCompl. ¶¶ 12–15, 17–26, 28–29, 31–32, 34).\n      Plaintiffs have learned since the news broke, for\n\n\n\n\n                                 14\n\finstance, that the NYPD’s so-called “Newark report”\ndesignates several of them as a “Location of Concern,”\ndefined “as, among other things, a ‘location that individuals\nmay find co-conspirators for illegal actions,’ and a ‘location\nthat has demonstrated a significant pattern of illegal\nactivities.’” Compl. ¶ 58. Similarly, the NYPD’s “U.S.–Iran\nreport” describes organizations believed to pose serious\nthreats to New York City, such as Hezbollah and Hamas,\nalong with a list of “Other Shi’a Locations in the vicinity of\nNYC,” which include Plaintiff Muslim Foundation Inc.\n(“MFI”) and Masjid-e-Ali mosque (owned and operated by\nMFI), “as well as three additional mosques attended by\nPlaintiff Hassan.” Id. ¶ 60.\n        While Plaintiffs allege that the Program is stigmatizing\nby itself, they also claim these specific defamatory statements\ntargeting them in particular have intensified their harms and\nthat “New York City officials” have exacerbated these\ninjuries by publicly “acknowledg[ing] the [Program’s]\nexistence” and “describing it as focused on ‘threats’ and as an\nattempt to document the ‘likely whereabouts of terrorists.’”\nId. ¶ 61. “Discussing the surveillance, [former] Mayor\nBloomberg has stated publicly” that “[w]e’re doing the right\nthing. We will continue to do the right thing.” Id. ¶ 64. And\n“[former Police] Commissioner Kelly has said” that “[w]e’re\ngoing to continue to do what we have to do to protect the\n[C]ity.” Id. Plaintiffs state that these and other “official\nproclamations,” which “falsely suggest that Muslims alone\npresent a unique law enforcement threat,” indicate “that [City\nofficials] believe the NYPD’s targeting of Muslims for\nsurveillance on the basis of their religion is appropriate and\nwill continue.” Id. ¶¶ 64–65.\n      Plaintiffs also contend that, in large part because of the\nProgram’s     alleged     stigmatizing      and     reputational\nconsequences, the surveillance has affected their worship and\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\freligious activities. For example, Plaintiff Hassan, a soldier\nin the U.S. Army who has worked in military intelligence,\nasserts that “[h]e has decreased his mosque attendance\nsignificantly” because of his belief that “being closely\naffiliated with mosques under surveillance by law\nenforcement” will jeopardize his ability to hold a security\nclearance and will tarnish his reputation among his fellow\nsoldiers and diminish their trust in him. Id. ¶¶ 11–13.\nLikewise, Plaintiffs Moiz Mohammed, Jane Doe, and Soofia\nTahir state that they now avoid (or have avoided) discussing\ntheir faith openly or at MSA meetings for fear of being\nwatched and documented, id. ¶¶ 24–30, and Plaintiff\nMohammad alleges that “[t]he stigma now attached to being a\nMuslim member of the MSA has caused [him] to avoid\ndiscussing his faith or his MSA participation in public and to\navoid praying in places where non-Muslims might see him\ndoing so,” id. ¶ 25.\n\n        The individual Plaintiffs are not the only ones affected.\nThe organizational Plaintiffs allege that the Program “has\nundermined their ability to fulfill their mission[s by] deterring\npotential members from joining and casting doubt on [their]\nability to maintain the confidentiality of their membership.”\nPls.’ Br. 6 (citing Compl. ¶ 17). According to the Complaint,\ntwo mosques that are members of Plaintiff Council of Imams\nin New Jersey, and that are named in the NYPD’s Newark\nreport, “have . . . seen a decline in attendance . . . as a result\nof the [NYPD’s] surveillance” because their congregants can\nno longer worship freely knowing that law-enforcement\nagents or informants are likely in their midst. Compl. ¶ 15.\nSimilarly, “[a]s affinity student groups, MSAs subject to\nsurveillance . . . are diminished in their ability to establish\nviable student organizations that students will feel secure\njoining and participating in” and are less able “to embark\nupon integral partnerships with campus administrators and\nother organizations and [to] fulfill the spiritual needs of their\n\n\n\n                                   16\n\fmembers in a confidential manner.” Id. ¶ 17. And Plaintiff\nMFI has changed its religious and educational programming\nto avoid controversial topics likely to stigmatize its\nmembership further and to attract additional NYPD attention.\nId. ¶ 23.\n       Finally, several Plaintiffs also contend that financial\nharm has accompanied their alleged religious, reputational,\nand stigmatizing injuries. For example, Plaintiffs All Shop\nBody Inside & Outside and Unity Beef Sausage Company\nclaim that the surveillance has damaged their “business[es] by\nscaring away customers,” id. ¶¶ 19, 21, and Plaintiffs Zaimah\nAbdur-Rahim and Abdul-Hakim Abdullah allege that the\npublication of the address and a photograph on the Internet of\ntheir home “in connection with the NYPD’s\nsurveillance . . . has decreased [its] value . . . and diminished\n[its] prospects for sale,” id. ¶¶ 31–32, 34. Also, two of\nPlaintiff Council of Imams in New Jersey’s member mosques\nhave witnessed “[l]osses in . . . financial support,” which\nfurther “harm[s] both mosques’ ability to fulfill their religious\nmissions.” Id. ¶ 15.\n\n       B.     District Court\n        In June 2012, Plaintiffs sued the City pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 and Monell v. Department of Social Services of\nthe City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), for discriminating\nagainst them as Muslims in violation of the Free Exercise and\nEstablishment Clauses of the First Amendment and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They seek\nexpungement of any unlawfully obtained records pertaining\nto them, a judgment declaring that the City has violated their\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights, an order enjoining\ntheir future discriminatory surveillance, and damages.\n       The District Court granted the City’s Motion to\n\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\fDismiss the Complaint in February 2014 pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of standing and\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\nclaim. First, the Court held that Plaintiffs failed to identify\nany cognizable “injury-in-fact” (let alone one “fairly\ntraceable” to the City’s surveillance). Second, it concluded\nthat Plaintiffs failed to state a claim because “[t]he more\nlikely explanation for the surveillance was a desire to locate\nbudding terrorist conspiracies” than a desire to discriminate.\nHassan v. City of New York, No. 12-cv-3401, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">654604</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (D.N.J. Feb. 20, 2014). It therefore entered\njudgment in the City’s favor. Plaintiffs now appeal these\nrulings.\n\nIII.   STANDING\n        As did the District Court, we begin with Plaintiffs’\nstanding to have a federal court decide their claims. Standing\nto sue is required for jurisdiction in a federal forum. Derived\nfrom Article III of our Constitution, it is the threshold inquiry\nin every case, one for which “[t]he party invoking federal\njurisdiction bears the burden of [proof].” Lujan v.

Analyzing this\nrequirement entails a three-part inquiry. Has at least one\nplaintiff suffered an “injury in fact”? Id. If so, is that injury\n“fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\ndefendant”? Id. at 560 (alterations in original) (quoting\nSimon v. E. Ky.

And if the answer to both is yes, will that injury be\n“likely . . . redressed by a favorable decision”? Id. at 561\n(quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 38).\n       When answering these questions, “we must assume\nthat the party asserting federal jurisdiction is correct on the\nlegal merits of his claim, that a decision on the merits would\nbe favorable[,] and that the requested relief would be\n\n\n\n\n                                  18\n\fgranted.” Cutler v.

The City\ncontends that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy this requirement\nbecause the Associated Press (“AP”), not the NYPD, revealed\nthe Program to the public and did so without the City’s\npermission.

Rather,\nPlaintiffs’ religious affiliation must have been a substantial\nfactor in that different treatment. Davis, 426 U.S. at 235;\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 276.\n\n                     i.     Plaintiffs Plausibly Allege a\n                            Surveillance Program with a\n                            Facially Religious Classification.\n\n       There are a variety of theories to consider in an equal-\nprotection claim of this type. First, Plaintiffs could point to a\npolicy that is facially discriminatory, meaning that the policy\n“by its own terms” singles out Muslims “for different\ntreatment.” 3 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise\non Constitutional Law § 18.4 (10th ed. 2012); see, e.g.,\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 213, 227–29. Second, they could\nidentify a policy that “either shows no classification on its\nface or else indicates a classification which seems to be\nlegitimate,” yet one that NYPD officers apply to Muslims\nwith a greater “degree[] of severity” than other religious\ngroups. Rotunda & Novak, supra, § 18.4; see, e.g., Yick Wo\nv. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373–74 (1886). Or, third, Plaintiffs\ncould identify a facially neutral policy that the City\npurposefully “designed to impose different burdens” on\n\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fMuslims and that (even if applied evenhandedly) does in fact\nhave the intended adverse effect. Rotunda & Novak, supra,\n§ 18.4; see, e.g., Village of Arlington Heights v. Met. Hous.\nDev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264–65 (1977).\n        Here, Plaintiffs seek to proceed by way of the first of\nthese three methods, arguing their “allegations leave no doubt\nthat the . . . [Program] relies on an express classification of\nMuslims for disfavored treatment.” See Pls.’ Br. 10. This is\na viable legal theory. Where a plaintiff can point to a facially\ndiscriminatory policy, “the protected trait by definition plays\na role in the decision-making process, inasmuch as the policy\nexplicitly classifies people on that basis.”5 Cmty.

While a\n“[p]laintiff[] ha[s] no difficulty establishing what a policy is\nwhen the policy is written,” “[a]n unwritten policy, by\ncontrast, is usually harder to establish.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                  30\n\f        The City nonetheless attacks the plausibility of the\nallegations, arguing that Plaintiffs point to only “conclusory\nallegations . . . spread throughout [the] . . .

It\nfurther asserts that, “[o]nce the conclusory allegations are\npushed aside, the remaining factual allegations are\ninsufficient       to   find   a     facially    discriminatory\nclassification.” Id.\n        We disagree with this characterization. While the City\ncompares Plaintiffs’ claims to the conclusory allegations in\nIqbal, those were far from what we have here. In our case,\nPlaintiffs allege specifics about the Program, including when\nit was conceived (January 2002), where the City implemented\nit (in the New York Metropolitan area with a focus on New\nJersey), and why it has been employed (because of the belief\n“that Muslim religious identity . . . is a permissible proxy for\ncriminality,” Compl. ¶ 36). The Complaint also articulates\nthe “variety of methods” by which the surveillance is carried\nout. See, e.g., id. ¶ 39 (“tak[ing] videos and photographs at\nmosques, Muslim-owned businesses and schools”); id.\n(“monitor[ing Muslim] websites, listservs, and chat rooms”);\nid. ¶ 46 (“snap[ping] pictures, tak[ing] video, and collect[ing]\nlicense plate numbers of congregants as they arrive at\nmosques to pray”); id. ¶ 47 (“us[ing] undercover\nofficers . . . to  monitor       daily    life   in    [Muslim]\nneighborhoods . . . and sermons and conversations in\nmosques”); id. ¶ 49 (“plac[ing] informants or undercover\nofficers in all or virtually all MSAs”). These allegations are\nhardly “bare assertions . . . amount[ing] to nothing more than\na ‘formulaic recitation of the elements’ of a constitutional\ndiscrimination claim.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (quoting Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 544, 545 (2007)).\n      Despite the City’s demand for more information about\nwhen, by whom, and how the policy was enacted and where it\n\n\n\n\n                                  31\n\fwas written down, “the Twombly–Iqbal duo have not\ninaugurated an era of evidentiary pleading.” Santana v.

Plaintiffs’ allegations, which draw on the sources of\ncircumstantial evidence commonly used to make out a prima\nfacie case of intentional discrimination in a disparate-\ntreatment suit of this type, easily satisfy the plausibility\nthreshold required to survive a motion to dismiss.

In holding\ngender to be a “quasi-suspect” classification deserving of\nintermediate scrutiny, the Supreme Court noted, for instance,\nin Frontiero that, because Congress is “a coequal branch of\nGovernment,” its “conclu[sion] that classifications based\nupon sex are inherently invidious . . . [was] not without\nsignificance to the question [then] under consideration.” 411\nU.S. at 687–88.\n       Many of the same statutes that foreclose sex-based\ndiscrimination, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 cited by the Frontiero Court, see id. at 687, also forbid\nreligious discrimination. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2\n(making it an “unlawful employment practice” for an\nemployer to discriminate based on “race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin”).

See, e.g., President George\nWashington, Address to the Members of the New Church in\nBaltimore (Jan. 1793), in 2 Jared Sparks, Life of George\nWashington Commander-in-Chief of the American Armies: to\nWhich Are Added, His Diaries and Speeches; and Various\n\n\n\n16\n   Act of Mar. 1, 1875, ch. 114, 18 Stat. 335 (“[I]t is essential\nto just government we recognize the equality of all men\nbefore the law, and hold that it is the duty of government in\nits dealings with the people to mete out equal and exact\njustice to all, of whatever nativity, race, color, or persuasion,\nreligious or political . . . .”).\n17\n    See, e.g., U.S. Patriot Act of 2001, Pub.

CONCLUSION\n       The allegations in Plaintiffs’ Complaint tell a story in\nwhich there is standing to complain and which present\nconstitutional concerns that must be addressed and, if true,\nredressed. Our job is judicial. We “can apply only law, and\n\n\n\n\n                                 58\n\fmust abide by the Constitution, or [we] cease to be civil\ncourts and become instruments of [police] policy.”\nKorematsu, 323 U.S. at 247 (Jackson, J., dissenting).\n       We believe that statement of Justice Jackson to be on\nthe right side of history, and for a majority of us in quiet\ntimes it remains so . . . until the next time there is the fear of a\nfew who cannot be sorted out easily from the many. Even\nwhen we narrow the many to a class or group, that\nnarrowing—here to those affiliated with a major worldwide\nreligion—is not near enough under our Constitution. “[T]o\ninfer that examples of individual disloyalty prove group\ndisloyalty and justify discriminatory action against the entire\ngroup is to deny that under our system of law individual guilt\nis the sole basis for deprivation of rights.” Id. at 240\n(Murphy, J., dissenting).\n       What occurs here in one guise is not new. We have\nbeen down similar roads before. Jewish-Americans during\nthe Red Scare, African-Americans during the Civil Rights\nMovement, and Japanese-Americans during World War II are\nexamples that readily spring to mind. We are left to wonder\nwhy we cannot see with foresight what we see so clearly with\nhindsight—that “[l]oyalty is a matter of the heart and mind[,]\nnot race, creed, or color.” Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (1944).\n       We reverse and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    59\n\fROTH, Circuit Judge, concurrence.\n\n        I agree that plaintiffs have demonstrated standing and\nmade sufficient allegations of violations of equal-protection\nrights.. I differ from the majority in its failure to determine\nwhether “intermediate scrutiny” or “strict scrutiny” applies\nhere. In our determinations so far, we have also, I believe,\nmade the findings necessary to resolve the issue of the\nappropriate level of scrutiny.\n\n       In my opinion, “intermediate scrutiny” is appropriate\nhere. I say this because “intermediate scrutiny” is the level\napplied in gender discrimination cases. I have the immutable\ncharacteristic of being a woman. I am happy with this\ncondition, but during my 80 years on this earth, it has caused\nme at times to suffer gender discrimination. My remedy now\nfor any future gender discrimination would be reviewed with\n“intermediate scrutiny.” For that reason, I cannot endorse a\nlevel of scrutiny in other types of discrimination cases that\nwould be stricter than the level which would apply to\ndiscrimination against me as a woman.\n\n\n\n\n                              1\n\f</pre>",
