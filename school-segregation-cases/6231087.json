Haines,\nAssistant Ohio State Public Defender, Columbus, Ohio, for Appellant.\n\nMike DeWine, Ohio Attorney General, and Jocelyn K. Lowe, Special\nAssistant Prosecutor, Columbus, Ohio, for Appellee.\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nMcFarland, J.\n\n        {¶1} Dennis Wright appeals the Order on Sentencing entered May 23,\n\n2016 in the Jackson County Court of Common Pleas. Wright was convicted\n\nof multiple counts of sexual battery, unlawful sexual conduct with a minor,\n\ngross sexual imposition, and rape. On appeal, Wright asserts: (1) his rights\n\nto due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court allowed the\n\nState to present overly prejudicial evidence of prior bad acts through a non-\n\nvictim witness; and (2) he was rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel\n\ndue to trial counsel’s failure to move to sever certain counts of the\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                     2\n\nindictment for purposes of trial. However, having reviewed the record\n\nherein, as well as the pertinent Ohio law, we find no merit to Wright’s\n\nassignments of error. Accordingly, we overrule both assignments of error\n\nand affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                   FACTS\n\n      {¶2} In February 2016, Appellant was indicted by the Jackson\n\nCounty Grand Jury as follows:\n\n      Count One           Sexual Battery, R.C. 2907.03(A)(12);\n\n      Count Two           Sexual Battery, R.C. 2907.03(A)(12);\n\n      Count Three         Unlawful Sexual Conduct with a Minor,\n                          R.C. 2907.04(A);\n\n      Count Four          Unlawful Sexual conduct with a Minor;\n                          R.C. 2907.04(A);\n\n      Count Five          Illegal Use of a Minor in Nudity-Oriented\n                          Material, R.C. 2907.323(A)(1);\n\n      Count Six           Gross Sexual Imposition, R.C. 2907.05(A)(1);\n\n      Count Seven         Gross Sexual Imposition, R.C. 2907.05(A)(1);\n\n      Count Eight         Gross Sexual Imposition, R.C. 2907.05(A)(1);\n\n      Count Nine          Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c);\n\n      Count Ten           Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2);\n\n      Count Eleven        Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c);\n\n      Count Twelve        Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2);\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                            3\n\n      Count Thirteen       Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c);\n\n      Count Fourteen       Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2); and,\n\n      Count Fifteen        Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).\n\n      {¶3} At the time of the indictment, Appellant pastored a church in\n\nrural Jackson County. Appellant was married and had two adult sons. The\n\ncomplaining witnesses in the indictment were two of Appellant’s\n\ncongregants at the church, one a teenage female, and one a mentally\n\nchallenged adult female. The third complaining witness was one of\n\nAppellant’s sons, dating back to the complainant’s childhood.\n\n      {¶4} The indictment also contained sexually violent predator\n\nspecifications as to Counts 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Appellant was\n\nappointed counsel and entered not guilty pleas. The case eventually\n\nproceeded to jury trial which took place May 9 through May 16, 2016. Prior\n\nto trial, Appellant waived his right to trial on the sexually violent predator\n\nspecifications.\n\n      {¶5} The State’s theory of the case was Appellant abused his familiar\n\nrelationship with the victims and his authority as their pastor, and father, to\n\nperpetrate his criminal sexual activity. The defense strategy was to portray\n\nAppellant as a victim of lies and innuendo by complainants with ulterior\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                            4\n\nmotives of their own. Local media sources followed the case during the\n\npretrial and trial phases.\n\n      {¶6} At trial, the State presented testimony from M.S., a complaining\n\nwitness; Marjorie Norman, an eyewitness to one of the instances of abuse;\n\nM.S.’s twin sister; Deputy Urias Hall, an investigator for the Jackson County\n\nSheriff’s Office; T.R., another complaining witness; J.W., Appellant’s son\n\nand a complaining witness; Dr. Amy Luckeydoo, a pediatrician employed by\n\nthe Child Protection Center in Ross County, Ohio; Ashley Muse, a forensic\n\ninterviewer with the Child Protection Center; T.S., M.S.’s older sister; and,\n\nAgent Latisha Schuler of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and\n\nInvestigation. The State also offered two exhibits: a DVD of Ashley Muse’s\n\nforensic interview with M.S. and a recorded conversation between Agent\n\nSchuler and Appellant.\n\n      {¶7} When the State rested, defense counsel made a Crim.R. 29\n\nmotion to dismiss the charges due to insufficient evidence. The trial court\n\noverruled the motion. Appellant then presented testimony from his wife,\n\nDiana Wright. Appellant also testified on his own behalf. After the defense\n\nrested, both sides gave closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury,\n\nand the jury retired to deliberate.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                            5\n\n      {¶8} Appellant was subsequently convicted of all counts except count\n\nfive, illegal use of a minor in sexually oriented material. He was sentenced\n\nto consecutive sentences for all counts, and life imprisonment. This timely\n\nappeal followed. Where pertinent, additional facts will be set forth below.\n\n                         ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n      “I. MR. WRIGHT’S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A\n      FAIR TRIAL WERE VIOLATED WHEN THE TRIAL\n      COURT ALLOWED THE STATE TO PRESENT OVERLY\n      PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT PRIOR BAD ACTS\n      THROUGH A NON-VICTIM WITNESS.”\n\n                        A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      {¶9} The admission of other acts evidence lies within the broad\n\ndiscretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court will not disturb the trial\n\ncourt's decision in the absence of an abuse of that discretion. State v. Ruble,\n\n4th Dist. Washington No. 16CA20, 2017-Ohio-7259, at ¶ 27; State v.\n\nMorris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, ¶ 14. “ ‘A\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion when it makes a decision that is\n\nunreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary.’ ” State v. Keenan, 143 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 397, 2015-Ohio-2484, 38 N.E.3d 870, ¶ 7, quoting State v. Darmond,\n\n135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶ 34. An abuse of\n\ndiscretion includes a situation in which a trial court did not engage in a\n\n“sound reasoning process”; this review is deferential and does not permit an\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                           6\n\nappellate court to simply substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\n\nDarmond at ¶ 34. We are mindful, however, that “Although the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard usually affords maximum [deference] to the lower court,\n\nno court retains discretion to adopt an incorrect legal rule or to apply an\n\nappropriate rule in an inappropriate manner. Such a course of conduct\n\nwould result in an abuse of discretion.” 2-J Supply Inc. v. Garrett & Parker,\n\nLLC, 4th Dist. Highland No. 13CA29, 2015-Ohio-2757, ¶ 9, quoting Safest\n\nNeighborhood Assn. v. Athens Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 2013-Ohio-5610, 5\n\nN.E.3d 694, ¶ 16.\n\n                           B. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n      {¶10} In general, “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not\n\nadmissible to prove the character of a person to show action in conformity\n\ntherewith.” Evid.R. 404(B). “It may, however, be admissible * * * [to\n\nprove] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\n\nabsence of mistake or accident.” Id. But evidence of other crimes and acts\n\nof wrongdoing are strictly construed against admissibility. See also Ruble,\n\nsupra, at ¶ 25; State v. Marshall, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 06CA23, 2007-\n\nOhio-6298, ¶ 46.\n\n      {¶11} In determining the admissibility of other acts evidence, trial\n\ncourts should determine: (1) whether the other acts evidence is relevant to\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                           7\n\nestablishing any fact that is of consequence, i.e. the other acts make the\n\nexistence of a material fact more or less probable than it would be without\n\nthat evidence; (2) whether the other acts evidence is presented to prove the\n\ncharacter of the accused in order to show the accused acted in conformity\n\nwith that character, or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a\n\nlegitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B); and (3) whether\n\nthe probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice under Evid.R. 403. Ruble, at ¶ 26; State v.\n\nWilliams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 20;\n\nState v. Adams, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 15CA010868, 2017-Ohio-1178, ¶ 10;\n\nState v. Fowler, 2017-Ohio-438, ––– N.E.3d ––––, ¶ 17, 2017 WL 495595\n\n(10th Dist.).\n\n      {¶12} In his first assignment of error, Appellant asserts that the trial\n\ncourt prejudiced him when it admitted testimony of M.S.’s sister, T.S.\n\nAppellant argues this testimony essentially added another unindicted accuser\n\nto bolster the State’s case with improper propensity evidence. The State\n\nfiled a motion to use Evid.R. 404(B) evidence to show Appellant’s motive,\n\npreparation, plan, and modus operandi.\n\n      {¶13} The State’s motion indicated T.S.’s testimony would be that\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         8\n\nbetween 2010 and 2011, when T.S. was 14 and 15 years old, Appellant\n\ntaught T.S. to drive a truck and used this opportunity to touch her breasts.\n\nThe State argued in doing so, Appellant used his role as T.S.’s pastor and\n\ntrusted family friend to gain access to her and sexually assault her. The\n\nState argued that Appellant used the same relationship with the victims as\n\ntheir pastor and trusted family friend to gain access to M.S., whom he also\n\ntaught to drive and also sexually assaulted by touching her breasts during the\n\n“lesson.” M.S. was almost the exact same age as T.S. when Appellant\n\nmolested her. The State concluded that in using the same relationship, the\n\nsame location, the same scheme, and the same sexual contact, the evidence\n\nadduced from T.S.’s testimony was admissible and relevant in the current\n\ncase pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) to show motive, preparation, plan, and\n\nmodus operandi in committing the sexual abuse against M.S.\n\n      {¶14} At a hearing to resolve pretrial motions, Appellant argued it\n\nwas highly prejudicial to allow T.S.’s testimony when she was not named as\n\na victim in any count of the indictment. However, by written decision, the\n\ntrial court announced it would be allowing T.S. to testify. The trial court\n\nrelied on the Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision in State v. Williams, 134\n\nOhio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, and the Eight District\n\nCourt of Appeals’ decision in State v. Herrington, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        9\n\n101322, 2015-Ohio-1820, finding that the factual scenario in Appellant’s\n\ncase was strikingly similar to the facts in Harrington.\n\n      {¶15} The first witness at Appellant’s trial was M.S., age 17. She\n\ntestified in the past, her family attended a church with Appellant, and she\n\nidentified Appellant. Appellant was the pastor and the congregation was a\n\nvery small group which included her family, Appellant’s family, and only a\n\nfew others.\n\n      {¶16} M.S. testified she sometimes went to Appellant’s farm to help\n\nhim clean stalls and feed the animals. At times, Appellant bought her candy,\n\nfood, and clothing. When M.S. was 10-13 years old, Appellant began\n\ntalking to her about sex and “how it would feel.” He also touched her\n\nbreasts and vagina under her clothing. When he put his hands on her, she\n\nwould tell him to stop and try to shrug him away or try to get her clothes\n\nback. He told her “it would make him love again and all that but that he\n\nloves me.”\n\n      {¶17} On occasion, Appellant would get on top of M.S. on the floor\n\nof his bedroom. Once he put his penis on her vagina and it hurt. He also\n\nasked her at times to touch his penis with her hand. She felt “awkward and\n\n“really didn’t want to.” M.S. testified she was forced to do it, “He kept\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         10\n\nnagging and riding me until I did it.” One time, he had her put her mouth on\n\nhis penis. Afterwards she cried and complained she was sick.\n\n      {¶18} M.S. further testified that Appellant let her drive his truck to\n\npractice. He told her he would help her get her license “if I do stuff with\n\nhim.” M.S. testified she did not tell anyone what was happening because\n\nshe was scared and because her father did not “believe other victims when it\n\nhappened.” She also testified that on occasion, after doing the farm chores,\n\nM.S. would take a shower at Appellant’s house. Sometimes Appellant\n\nwould come in, open the door to look at her, and take pictures of her naked\n\nbody on his phone. M.S. later deleted them.\n\n      {¶19} The instances of abuse began when M.S. was 10-13 years old.\n\nThey occurred numerous times until she was 15 or 16 years old.\n\n      {¶20} On the fourth day of trial, T.S., now age 20, testified a handful\n\nof people, which included her family, attended the church where Appellant\n\npastored. T.S. testified when she was 14 or 15 years old, she was at\n\nAppellant’s house, in his truck, and he asked her if she wanted to learn to\n\ndrive. When they switched places in the truck and T.S. was driving, he told\n\nher “This is what young boys will do.” T.S. testified:\n\n      “He stuck his arm around… he stuck his arm around my\n      shoulders and tried to stick it down my shirt and I said no then\n      he stuck it around me and tried to stick it down the front and\n      back of my pants and I said no and I stopped him.”\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          11\n\n      {¶21} Prior to T.S.’s testimony, Appellant’s counsel renewed the\n\nobjection. At the close of trial, the court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n      “Evidence was admitted of other acts which the defendant may\n      have committed. You may not consider that evidence to\n      determine whether the defendant committed any act alleged in\n      the indictment. If you find from other evidence that the\n      defendant committed the acts charged in the indictment, then\n      you may consider the evidence of the other act as bearing upon\n      the defendant’s motive, preparation, plan, and modus\n      operandi.”\n\n      {¶22} Based upon our review of the facts herein and the pertinent\n\ncase law, we find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court’s ruling\n\nwhich allowed the State to present evidence of other acts through T.S.’s\n\ntestimony.\n\n      {¶23} In Williams, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio was asked to\n\ndetermine whether evidence that the defendant had a prior sexual\n\nrelationship with an underage boy, A.B., he coached in the 1990s was\n\nproperly admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) in the State's prosecution of\n\nthe defendant for sex offenses committed in 2008 against a different\n\nunderage boy, J.H., that the defendant was mentoring. Id. The Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an\n\naccused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be\n\nadmissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B)—to\n\nshow proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          12\n\nidentity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Id. at ¶ 19. The court set forth a\n\nthree-step analysis that courts should conduct in determining the\n\nadmissibility of other acts evidence. Id. First, the court should “consider\n\nwhether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it\n\nwould be without the evidence.” Id. at ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, the\n\ncourt should “consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts\n\nis presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in\n\nconformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a\n\nlegitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).” Id. Third, the\n\ncourt should “consider whether the probative value of the other acts\n\nevidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” Id.,\n\nciting Evid.R. 403.\n\n      {¶24} In Williams, applying the three-part test, the Court determined\n\nthat the other acts evidence related to the defendant's conduct and\n\nrelationship with A.B. and was properly admitted in accordance with\n\nEvid.R. 404(B) as it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the\n\npart of the defendant. Id. at ¶ 24 –25. With respect to the first step of the\n\ncourt's three-part test, the court found that A.B.'s testimony was relevant\n\n“because it tended to show the motive [the defendant] had and the\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          13\n\npreparation and plan he exhibited of targeting, mentoring, grooming, and\n\nabusing teenage boys.” Id. at ¶ 22. Further, A.B.'s testimony “rebutted the\n\nsuggestion offered by the defense during opening statements that J.H. had\n\nfalsely accused [the defendant] of abuse with the hope of getting out of\n\ntrouble at school and the suggestion that [the defendant] was sexually\n\nattracted to women.” Id. As for the second part of the test, the court noted\n\nthat the evidence of the defendant's relationship with A.B. was not offered to\n\nshow that abusing J.H. was in conformity with the defendant's character. Id.\n\nat ¶ 23. “In fact, the trial court gave two limiting instructions that this\n\nevidence was not being offered to prove [the defendant's] character—one\n\njust prior to the testimony of A.B. and one prior to deliberation.” Id. Finally,\n\nwith respect to the third part of the test, the court found that the evidence\n\nwas not unduly prejudicial given the limiting instructions provided to the\n\njury. Id. at ¶ 24. “[T]he trial court instructed the jury that this evidence\n\ncould not be considered to show that [the defendant] had acted in conformity\n\nwith a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of\n\nA.B.'s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.'s testimony about the sexual\n\nabuse, which had been denied by [the defendant].” Id.\n\n      {¶25} In State v. Powih, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2016-11-023,\n\n2017-Ohio-7208, the appellate court found the facts therein to be similar to\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        14\n\nWilliams and, after applying the three-part test, concluded that the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in permitting the other acts evidence. The court\n\nfound the testimony of the uninindicted complainant in Powih was relevant\n\nas it tended to show the appellant's motive, intent, and plan of targeting and\n\nsexually assaulting female nursing aides in their mid-twenties who were\n\nisolated in a resident's room while caring for elderly patients who lacked\n\nawareness of what was occurring around them. The challenged other acts\n\ntestimony was also relevant to prove the absence of mistake and to rebut the\n\nsuggestion offered by the defense during opening statements that A.H.\n\nconsented to sexual contact with the appellant before falsely accusing the\n\nappellant of assaulting her because she did not want to accept responsibility\n\nfor her actions. Id. at ¶ 27.\n\n       {¶26} In this case, the trial court’s decision allowing T.S.’s testimony\n\nalso cited State v. Herrington. There Herrington was indicted and charged\n\nwith multiple counts of gross sexual imposition, one count of kidnapping,\n\nand one count of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or\n\nperformance. Prior to Herrington’s trial, the court addressed appellant's\n\npretrial motions to exclude other acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n       {¶27} The evidence involved Herrington’s prior acts against a 19-\n\nyear-old victim, A.H., in 1995. Before the jury was selected, the trial court\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        15\n\nstated that it would permit A.H. to testify but that evidence of the appellant's\n\nprior conviction would not be admitted. The matter proceeded to jury trial\n\nin March, 2014.\n\n      {¶28} A.H., then 37 years old, testified she knew Herrington from the\n\ntime of her birth. A.H.'s father and Herrington were “best friends” and both\n\nserved as associate ministers at their church. A.H. testified that in 1995,\n\nHerrington approached her at her parents’ home and offered to give her\n\ndriving lessons. A.H. accepted his offer because she wanted to get her\n\ndriver’s license and was excited for the opportunity to learn how to drive.\n\nOver the course of approximately one month, Herrington took A.H. for\n\ndriving lessons on three separate occasions. After the last driving lesson,\n\nHerrington suddenly kissed A.H., placed her on a couch, got on top of her\n\nand forced her to have sexual intercourse. She stated, “I tried to push him\n\noff, but I couldn't get him off of me.”\n\n      {¶29} T.B., Herrington’s current victim, was 20 years old at the time\n\nof trial. She testified that she first met Herrington when he began a romantic\n\nrelationship with her grandmother when T.B. was approximately 7 or 8 years\n\nold. On separate occasions, T.B. lived with Herrington and her\n\ngrandmother. T.B. testified about several incidents when she was\n\ninappropriately touched by Herrington in her grandmother’s home.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                       16\n\nHowever, several incidents occurred after Herrington offered to provide T.B.\n\ndriving lessons when she was 15 years old. After the first driving lesson,\n\nT.B. went up to her bedroom. Herrington followed her to her bedroom and\n\nsaid he needed to “check [her] pulse” because “she seemed nervous and\n\ntense.” Herrington claimed that he had to check T.B.'s pulse on her chest\n\nand had her take her shirt off. Appellant then “cupped” her breast over her\n\nbra.\n\n       {¶30} Approximately two or three weeks later, Herrington offered to\n\ngive T.B. a second driving lesson. While in the vehicle, Herrington warned\n\nT.B. not to tell anyone about the driving lessons. When they returned home,\n\nT.B. went upstairs to her bedroom and Herrington followed her. Again,\n\nHerrington asked if he could check her pulse. On this occasion, Herrington\n\nhad T.B. take off her pants so he could check her pulse by touching her inner\n\nleg. T.B. testified that she complied and Herrington placed two fingers on\n\nher inner thigh and “brushed” his hand over her “private parts.”\n\n       {¶31} One month later, Herrington told T.B. that he was going to\n\ndrive to Akron and that he would let her drive on the freeway if she wanted\n\nto join him. T.B. agreed to go along. When they returned home, Herrington\n\nfollowed T.B. upstairs to her bedroom and began to give her a massage\n\nbecause he thought she “looked tense.” Herrington then asked her to take\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        17\n\nher shirt off. T.B. testified that she complied because they were alone and\n\nshe did not know what would happen if she told him no. T.B. stated that\n\nHerrington continued to give her a massage while she was lying face down\n\non the bed. Herrington then unclasped her bra and took off her pants. T.B.\n\ntestified that Herrington “moved” her underwear to the side and “separated\n\n[her] privates” with his fingers. T.B. closed her legs and Herrington went\n\ndownstairs shortly thereafter.\n\n      {¶32} The Herrington court was guided by the Supreme Court’s\n\nanalysis in Williams. The Herrington court applied the three-step analysis,\n\nreasoning as follows at ¶ 33:\n\n     “With regard to the first and second steps of the Williams test,\n     we find A.H.'s testimony was relevant and was presented for a\n     legitimate purpose under Evid.R. 404(B). Similar to the factual\n     scenario in Williams, appellant's relationship and interaction with\n     A.H. and T.B. were similar in character and method.\n     Collectively, A.H.'s testimony demonstrated appellant's motives\n     and the preparation and plan he exhibited, i.e., offering teenage\n     girls driving lessons and manipulating their confidence and trust\n     for his own sexual gratification. In our view, if believed by the\n     jury, such testimony could corroborate portions of T.B.'s\n     testimony. See Williams at ¶ 22.”\n\n     {¶33} The Herrington court, as did the court in Williams, also\n\nelaborated on the fact the trial court gave limiting instructions that the\n\nevidence was not being offered to prove appellant's character. Citing the\n\nsame authorities as Williams, the Herrington court further recognized the\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                      18\n\npresumption that the jury followed those instructions. Finally, the\n\nHerrington court considered whether the probative value of the other acts\n\nevidence of the prior relationship with A.H. was substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice. The Herrington court held:\n\n      “In our view, the challenged evidence is not unduly prejudicial\n      because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence\n      could not be considered to show that appellant had acted in\n      conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the\n      prejudicial effect of A.H.'s testimony, and A.H. corroborated\n      T.B.'s testimony about appellant's pattern of conduct, which had\n      been denied by appellant. Thus, Evid.R. 404(B) permitted\n      admission of evidence of appellant's prior crime because it\n      helped to prove appellant's motive, preparation, and plan.\n      Accordingly, the prejudicial effect did not substantially\n      outweigh the probative value of that evidence.”\n\n      {¶34} We begin the three-step analysis by considering whether the\n\nother acts evidence through T.S.’s testimony is relevant to establishing any\n\nfact that is of consequence. M.S.’s testimony regarding the sexual abuse\n\nwhich she endured is set forth above fully. She testified the abuse began\n\nwhen she was 10-13 years old and ended when she was 15-16 years old.\n\nAppellant was M.S.’s pastor and family friend. She testified Appellant\n\nbought her candy, food, and clothes. He also let her drive his truck and\n\npromised to help her get her driver’s license if she engaged in sexual\n\nactivities with him or allowed him to touch her.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         19\n\n      {¶35} Having reviewed M.S.’s testimony, we find T.S.’s testimony\n\nwas relevant to establishing a fact of consequence. In both cases, the abuse\n\noccurred when the teenage girls were the age to be interested in driving, and\n\nthe sexual abuse occurred during driving lessons or was endured for the sake\n\nof driving lessons. T.S.’s testimony, if believed, tended to corroborate\n\nM.S.’s testimony that at least part of the abuse she experienced occurred at\n\napproximately the same age and under the same pretextual assistance with\n\ndriving lessons.\n\n      {¶36} We also consider whether the other acts evidence is presented\n\nfor a legitimate purpose. Here, we find T.S.’s testimony was relevant to\n\nestablish Appellant’s motive, preparation, and plan. In both instances,\n\nAppellant took advantage of his relationship with the girls’ families and as\n\nthe girls’ pastor, in order to gain their trust. The reasonable inference is that\n\nhis motive was sexual gratification. It is also reasonable to infer that he\n\nplanned and prepared to sexually abuse them by either getting them in a\n\nvulnerable position in his truck with him for driving lessons, or using the\n\ndriving lessons as a “carrot” to get M.S. to agree to submit to unwanted\n\nsexual conduct. As in Herrington, Appellant’s relationship and interaction\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                                                      20\n\nwith teenage girls was similar in character and method. T.S.’s testimony\n\ndemonstrated Appellant’s motives, preparation, and the plan exhibited.1\n\n         {¶37} Finally, we consider whether the probative value of the other\n\nacts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nHere, the trial court’s ruling announced that it would give a limiting\n\ninstruction. The trial court then gave its limiting instruction during the\n\nclosing portion of trial, but not prior to T.S.’s testimony. And, the transcript\n\nis devoid of any request for a limiting instruction by Appellant.\n\n         {¶38} In Powih, supra, the trial court gave two limiting instructions\n\nregarding other acts testimony. Just prior to allowing the challenged\n\ntestimony, the court advised the jury as follows:\n\n         “Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to hear evidence\n         concerning a separate alleged incident, in May 2016, involving\n         Mr. Powih. This evidence is only being offered and may only\n         be considered by you in determining whether Mr. Powih had a\n         common scheme, a plan, or a system in engaging in the conduct\n         alleged in determining Mr. Powih's preparation, motive, intent,\n         or absence of mistake or accident, in engaging in the alleged\n         misconduct, with the alleged victim, in this present case.\n         You may not—again, you may not consider this evidence as\n         proof of Mr. Powih's character, in order to show that he acted in\n         conformity with that character.”\n\n\n1\n  See also State v. Shank, 9th Dist. Mahoning No. 12CA0104-M, 2013-Ohio-5368, ¶19 (As in Williams,\n[witnesses’] testimony was relevant because it tended to show Shank's motive and plan of targeting for\nsexual activity teenage girls who spent the night at his house after drinking alcohol. As the trial court noted,\n[the witnesses’ testimony was “highly probative of whether [Shank] acted in conformity with a plan or a\npurpose or an intent to commit these sexual offenses against [the complaining witness.].”)\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                                                21\n\n        {¶39} Then, prior to the jury's deliberation, the court provided a\n\nsecond limiting instruction to the jury regarding the other acts evidence. The\n\nPowih court noted the presumption that the jury followed the court's\n\ninstructions and did not consider the other acts testimony to show that Powih\n\nwas acting in conformity with bad character. 2\n\n        {¶40} In State v. Landers, 2nd Dist. Greene No. 2015-CA-74, 2017-\n\nOhio-1194, Landers argued that the trial court erred by failing to give a\n\ncontemporaneous instruction when the unindicted witness testified about the\n\n“other acts” evidence. However, the Landers court noted that the “other\n\nacts” testimony presented was not extensive, and a limiting instruction was\n\ngiven. Id. at 65. The Landers court also recognized an earlier decision in\n\nState v. Shaw, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 21880, 2008–Ohio–1317, wherein\n\nthe court stated: “[t]he limiting instruction should be given at the time the\n\n‘other acts’ evidence is received, [State v.] Lewis, supra, [66 Ohio App.3d\n\n37, 583 N.E.2d 404 (2nd Dist.1990) ] * * *. Shaw at ¶ 13; Landers at 66.\n\nLanders further noted that in Shaw, it did not say that the limiting instruction\n\n“must” be given at the time of the testimony. “We used the terms “should”\n\nand “either”—meaning that the instruction could be given at the time of the\n\n\n2\n See Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, at ¶ 23; State v. Stevens, 12th\nDist., 2017-Ohio-498, ––– N.E.3d ––––, ¶ 32; State v. Ward, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-07-059,\n2014-Ohio-990, ¶ 36.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                              22\n\ntestimony or at the end of the trial.” Landers at 67. The Landers court\n\nconcluded the trial court did not err in failing to give the instruction at the\n\ntime the witness testified, emphasizing that the trial court did give a limiting\n\ninstruction and the presumption that the jury followed its instructions.\n\n      {¶41} Similarly, in State v. Rodrigues, 10th Dist. Franklin No.\n\n95APA06-683, 1996 WL 146063 (Mar. 26, 1996), Rodrigues faulted the\n\ntrial court for not instructing the jury that other acts evidence was to be\n\nconsidered for a limited purpose only and not as substantive evidence of his\n\nguilt. The Rodrigues court duly noted Rodrigues did not request such an\n\ninstruction and thus waived all but plain error. The Rodrigues court opined\n\ntrial court's failure to sua sponte issue a limiting instruction to the jury with\n\nrespect to the other acts evidence would not have clearly changed the\n\noutcome of the proceedings. Moreover, Rodrigues recognized the Supreme\n\nCourt of Ohio’s decision in State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 1992-Ohio-\n\n31, 600 N.E.2d 661, in rejecting a defendant's claim that it was plain error\n\nfor a trial court to fail to give a limiting instruction on the use of other acts\n\nevidence, which stated:\n\n      “[T]he decision not to request a limiting instruction is\n      sometimes a tactical one, and we do not wish to impose a duty\n      on the trial courts to read this instruction when it is not\n      requested.” Schaim, supra, at 61-62, fn. 9.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                       23\n\n      {¶42} Here, we find the probative value of T.S.’s other acts testimony\n\nis not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nAppellant’s counsel did not request a limiting instruction prior to T.S.’s\n\ntestimony, which may or may not have been a tactical decision. However,\n\nthe trial court gave a limiting instruction along with the closing jury\n\ninstructions. As in Williams and the numerous other cases cited, we\n\npresume the jury followed the court’s instruction.\n\n      {¶43} Having engaged in the three-step analysis, we find the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in allowing T.S.’s testimony regarding\n\nother acts of the Appellant. As such, we find no merit to the first assignment\n\nof error and accordingly, it is hereby overruled.\n\n      “II. MR.

LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n      {¶47} At a pretrial hearing, defense counsel indicated a motion to\n\nsever would “probably” be filed. However, this filing did not occur.\n\nAppellant argues the indictment against him was based on allegations that he\n\nsexually assaulted three different individuals over the course of nearly 26\n\nyears. He argues while there are some similarities between the accounts as\n\ntold by the alleged victims, there were also significant differences.\n\nAppellant points out the allegation by Appellant’s son, supposedly occurring\n\nin 1989 and 1990, differed from the conduct alleged by the teenage female\n\nvictims in 2012-2015 and 2009-2010. Appellant argues the cumulative\n\nnature of the allegations caused him prejudice, and furthermore, if counsel\n\nhad requested severance, it is likely that it would have been granted and the\n\noutcome of his trials would have been different. Appellant concludes the\n\nfailure of his counsel to move to sever the counts pertaining to each of the\n\nalleged victims resulted in his being deprived of due process and a fair trial.\n\n       {¶48} Crim.R. 8(A) permits an indictment to charge two or more\n\noffenses “in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * *\n\nare of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or\n\ntransaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected\n\ntogether or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          27\n\ncourse of criminal conduct.” The law favors joining same or similar\n\noffenses in order to “conserve [ ] judicial and prosecutorial time, lessen[ ]\n\nthe not inconsiderable expenses of multiple trials, diminish[ ] inconvenience\n\nto witnesses, and minimize[ ] the possibility of incongruous results in\n\nsuccessive trials before different juries.” State v.

Crim.R. 14 states:\n\n“If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses\n\n* * * the court shall order * * * separate trial of counts * * * or provide such\n\nother relief as justice requires.” A defendant who claims that a trial court\n\nerred by refusing a Crim.R. 14 request for separate trials of multiple offenses\n\nmust (1) affirmatively demonstrate that his rights were prejudiced and (2)\n\nestablish “that the court abused its discretion in refusing to separate the\n\ncharges for trial.” State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        28\n\n(1981), syllabus; accord Fry at ¶ 197, 926 N.E.2d 1239; State v.

Thus, a reviewing\n\ncourt will not reverse a trial court's decision regarding a motion to sever\n\nunless the defendant shows that the trial court abused its discretion. We\n\nhave set forth the standard of review applicable to an abuse of discretion\n\nargument above.\n\n      {¶50} In response to Appellant’s argument, the State argues that\n\nAppellant was not prejudiced by the decision not to file a motion to sever.\n\nThe State contends the evidence of each offense was simple, distinct, and\n\nunlikely to confuse a jury. The State contends the evidence of other acts\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts had been severed. The State further\n\nargues the evidence of each offense was sufficient to sustain each verdict.\n\nAs such, the State concludes Appellant’s trial counsel’s performance was\n\nneither deficient nor prejudicial. We agree with the State’s arguments.\n\n       {¶51} The State may negate claims of prejudicial joinder in two\n\nways. Freeland, supra, at 13; Fry at ¶ 198, 926 N.E.2d 1239. Under the first\n\nmethod, known as the “other acts” test, joinder is not prejudicial if the joined\n\noffenses would be admissible in separate trials as “other acts” under Evid.R.\n\n404(B). Id.; Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293. Under the second\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          29\n\nmethod, known as the “joinder” test, the State is not required to meet the\n\nstricter “other acts” admissibility test, but is merely required to show that\n\nevidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct. State v. Roberts,\n\n62 Ohio St.2d 170, 175, 405 N.E.2d 247 (1980); State v. Torres, 66 Ohio\n\nSt.2d at 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288. “The purpose of the ‘joinder test’ is to\n\nprevent the finder of fact from confusing the offenses,” State v. Varney, 4th\n\nDist. Hocking No. 07CA18, 2008–Ohio–5283, ¶ 19, and “to prevent juries\n\nfrom combining the evidence to convict” the defendant of multiple crimes,\n\n“instead of carefully considering the proof offered for each separate\n\noffense.” State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 362, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992).\n\n“The two tests are disjunctive, so that the satisfaction of one negates a\n\ndefendant's claim of prejudice without consideration of the other.” State v.\n\nSullivan, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP–997, 2011–Ohio–6384, ¶ 23; accord\n\nMills, 62 Ohio St.3d at 362, 582 N.E.2d 972 (stating that “if the state can\n\nmeet the joinder test, it need not meet the stricter ‘other acts’ test”). “Thus,\n\nwhen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by\n\njoinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as\n\n‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).” Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163–64, 555\n\nN.E.2d 293; State v.

LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002–Ohio–2128, 767 N.E.2d\n\n166, ¶¶ 50–51; State v. Brinkley, 105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005–Ohio–1507, 824\n\nN.E.2d 959, ¶ 37; Varney at ¶ 19. Thus, a defendant does not suffer\n\nprejudice from joinder of offenses when the offenses charged in an\n\nindictment are “simple and distinct,” when “[t]he factual situation of each\n\ncrime was easy to understand and was capable of segregation, and when\n\n“[t]he crimes involved different victims, different factual situations and\n\ndifferent witnesses.” State v. Clifford, 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 212, 733\n\nN.E.2d 621 (1st Dist.1999).\n\n      {¶53} In Freeland, we considered the issue of joinder Freeland raised\n\non appeal. In 2012, the Ross County Grand Jury returned an indictment\n\ncharging Freeland with six counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of\n\nfelonious sexual penetration, and five counts of rape. The allegations arose\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                                                   31\n\nfrom reports law enforcement officers received between 2007 and 2009, that\n\nduring the mid-1990s, Freeland sexually abused his step-children, and\n\nanother young child whom he had tutored. Freeland filed a motion to sever\n\nthe offenses, which the trial court subsequently overruled. Freeland was\n\nconvicted of many of the offenses.\n\n         {¶54} In our decision affirming Freeland’s convictions, we\n\nconsidered the joinder issue and found that the State satisfied the elements of\n\nthe joinder test. Id. at 15. We observed that “the State presented simple and\n\ndirect testimony from three different individuals who described distinct and\n\nseparate acts that Appellant allegedly committed against them.” Id. J.F., a\n\ntwenty-two year old female, described sexual acts that occurred when she\n\nwas a young child living with Freeland, who was her step-father. J.B., J.F.'s\n\ntwenty-four year old brother, testified that when J.B. was around seven or\n\neight years old, Freeland rubbed or touched his penis on two occasions.\n\nD.T., a twenty-nine year old male who was unrelated to the other two\n\nwitnesses, described several incidents of fellatio and anal sex occurring\n\nwhen he was ten and eleven years old.\n\n         “Each witness thus provided a different account of the acts\n         appellant allegedly committed against them and there was no\n         overlap in the testimony.3 * * * Although the acts may have\n3\n See State v. Clyde, 6th Dist. Erie No. E–14–006, 2015–Ohio–1859, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Lewis, 6th Dist.\nLucas Nos. L–09–1224, L–09–1225, 2010–Ohio–4202, ¶ 33 (concluding that evidence simple and direct\nwhen “each victim testified as to his or her own experiences with [the defendant]” and stating joinder is not\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                                                  32\n\n         occurred around the same approximate time, the state presented\n         each witness's testimony separately so that there was no danger\n         of confusing the evidence. Furthermore, the state presented\n         more than sufficient evidence with respect to each victim so\n         that there is no danger that the jury convicted appellant based\n         upon a cumulation of evidence.4\n\n         {¶55} As in Freeland, we have reviewed the trial transcript and find\n\nthat the State satisfied the elements of the joinder test. The State presented\n\nsimple and direct testimony from the three victims, M.S., a teenage girl,\n\nT.R., a mentally challenged adult female, and J.W., his own son. With\n\nregard to the female victims, Appellant abused his friendship with the family\n\nand his authority as a pastor in their church to sexually assault the females.\n\nAs to the male victim, Appellant abused his position of authority as a parent.\n\n         {¶56} The details of the sexual abuse M.S. suffered have been\n\npreviously discussed. Further, on cross-examination, M.S. testified she went\n\nto Appellant’s house nearly every day during the summers. On Sundays,\n\nafter church, she would go home with Appellant and work in the barn until\n\ngoing back to church Sunday evening. Sometimes she stayed overnight,\n\nsleeping in a recliner or on the floor in Appellant’s room. Appellant’s wife\n\nand son were present at times. Appellant’s wife was often away at work.\n\n\nprejudicial when “ ‘the evidence is presented in an orderly fashion as to the separate offenses or victims\nwithout significant overlap or conflation of proof’ ”).\n4\n  See State v. Hand, 107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, at ¶ 170, quoting Torres, supra,\n66 Ohio St.2d at 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), and State v. Jamison, 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 187, 552 N.E.2d\n180 (1991).\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                           33\n\nM.S. acknowledged that she never feigned illness to get out of going to\n\nAppellant’s house. She testified she never told her twin sister about the\n\nabuse.\n\n         {¶57} In sum, Appellant’s acts of sexual abuse committed on M.S.\n\ninvolved his taking advantage of a young teenage girl by virtue of his\n\nposition of authority and were aided by his bestowing gifts of food and\n\nclothing and driving privileges. Although M.S. was forced to endure\n\nwrongful sexual conduct, Appellant told her he loved her and held out the\n\ngifts and driving lessons as quid pro quo for the unwanted sexual advances.\n\nM.S. testified on one occasion when she cried and said she was sick, he left\n\nher alone.\n\n         {¶58} By contrast, Appellant’s criminal sexual activity with T.R. was\n\ncruel, forceful, and at times violent. He called her names. Sometimes, if she\n\nrefused to engage in sexual conduct, Appellant would slap her back, hit her\n\nface, and “do it anyways.”\n\n         {¶59} At trial, T.R., age 35, testified she has lived with her mother\n\nalmost her entire life. She was in special classes in school, but dropped out\n\nin 10th grade due to bullying. She has never been employed and is unable to\n\ndrive a car. She testified she has seizures, PTSD, and a learning disability.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                       34\n\nT.R. also identified Appellant and testified she attended the church he\n\npastored. Appellant was also her neighbor.\n\n      {¶60} T.R. testified she went to Appellant’s house for cookouts. She\n\nenjoyed petting his horses and cows and sitting outside under a tree. In\n\n2009, she lived at Appellant’s house for approximately one year. Appellant\n\npromised he would help her obtain a GED and get a car. She slept on a\n\ncouch in the living room. She cleaned, vacuumed, and did outside work.\n\n      {¶61} T.R. was alone with Appellant when his wife and sons went to\n\nwork. She testified she had sexual relations with him. He touched her\n\nbreasts and vagina. At this point, T.R. became emotional and the court took\n\na break. When her testimony resumed, she explained she quit doing outside\n\nwork because Appellant told her she did it wrong. Appellant called her “the\n\nb-word,” “idiot,” and “stupid.”\n\n      {¶62} Appellant touched her with his hands and he placed his penis\n\ninside her vagina and her anus. Her mouth touched his penis. T.R.\n\nemphasized she “never” wanted to do these things.\n\n      {¶63} T.R. testified one time, in the living room, she was laying on\n\nher side because Appellant shoved her head onto his penis. Appellant’s son\n\nJ.W. overheard them arguing, came out and said “Dad you did it again.”\n\nT.R. testified J.W. punched Appellant’s face. Then J.W. smacked and\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                      35\n\npushed her. Appellant’s wife found out. T.R. lived there another week until\n\nsomeone in church found her an apartment.\n\n      {¶64} On cross-examination, T.R. acknowledged she lived at\n\nAppellant’s house because she wanted to get away from her mother and\n\nexperience life. She testified she never told anybody about Appellant’s\n\nabuse because she was “scared to death.” She admitted that when Appellant\n\nhit her, she did not have bruising.\n\n      {¶65} T.R. testified that when Appellant’s wife overheard the\n\ncommotion, she screamed “Oh, oh this done ruined everything. He ruined\n\nmy life.” T.R. denied leaving her mother’s house to get away from abuse by\n\nher mother. She testified Appellant took her pills and she had seizure\n\nactivity. When she has seizures, she sits and stares.\n\n      {¶66} On redirect, T.R. explained that she cannot remember what\n\nhappens during a seizure, but it does not make her forget other things.\n\n      {¶67} The sexual abuse M.S. and T.R. described was different from\n\nthat suffered by the third victim, Appellant’s son J.W. J.W., age 37, testified\n\nhe grew up in a very strict household. His father would punish him by\n\nbeating him with a horse whip, ball bats, a water hose, a chunk of wood, or\n\n“whatever” was nearby. When J.W. was 9 or 10, his father would touch\n\nJ.W.’s penis in the shower or the bedroom. Usually, after a spanking, his\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                      36\n\nfather would throw him back into bed and caress him in an inappropriate\n\nway. Appellant would touch his anus and insert his fingers. J.W. never told\n\nanyone and over the years, Appellant eventually quit abusing him.\n\n      {¶68} J.W. testified Agent Schuler sought him out and questioned\n\nhim. J.W. testified he and his wife were staying at Appellant’s house during\n\n2009-2010. One night, he heard a noise and went into the living room and\n\nsaw T.R. “giving my dad a blow job.” Appellant ran into the bedroom. J.W.\n\nconfronted him and hit him in the mouth. J.W. was also upset with T.R.\n\nHowever, J.W. did not report the incident. J.W. does not have a relationship\n\nwith T.R. J.W. admitted he had a misdemeanor conviction for falsification.\n\n      {¶69} On cross-examination, J.W. described T.R. as follows: “I\n\ndidn’t think she was all there. I thought something might have been wrong\n\nwith her * * * mentally.” However, he also testified she could cook, help\n\nmow, and he thought she knew right from wrong. J.W. also admitted when\n\nhe was 13 or 14, he was removed from the home because his parents could\n\nnot control him.\n\n      {¶70} We find the evidence presented by the State’s three\n\ncomplaining witnesses to be simple and direct. While there are some\n\nsimilarities, such as the fact M.S. and T.R. knew Appellant through church,\n\nand that M.S. and T.R. both performed farm chores for Appellant, each\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          37\n\nwitness testified to his or her own experiences. The three witnesses’\n\ntestimony regarding their own unwanted sexual encounters was detailed and\n\nstraightforward. We also note, as a matter of the presentation of evidence,\n\nthere were other witnesses that testified between M.S. and T.R., and then\n\nbetween T.R. and J.W. The only overlap in testimony occurred when J.W.\n\ntestified he walked in on the sexual activity between Appellant and T.R.,\n\nhowever we do not find that overlap to be significant.\n\n      {¶71} In Freeland, we also observed that courts have held that any\n\nprejudice that results from the joinder of offenses is minimized when a trial\n\ncourt cautions a jury before deliberations to consider each count, and the\n\nevidence applicable to each count separately, and to state its findings as to\n\neach count uninfluenced by its verdict on any other counts. Freeland, supra,\n\nat 16; State v. Gibson, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L–13–1223 and L–13–1222,\n\n2015–Ohio–1679, ¶ 30; State v. Meeks, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA17,\n\n2015-Ohio-1527, at ¶ 99; State v. Hillman, 2014-Ohio-5760, 26 N.E.2d\n\n1236 (10th Dist.), at ¶ 40. Here, at Appellant’s trial during closing, the trial\n\ncourt instructed:\n\n      “The charges set forth in each count in the indictment\n      constitutes a separate and distinct matter. You must consider\n      each count and the evidence applicable to each count separately\n      and you must state your finding as to each count uninfluenced\n      by your verdict as to any other count. The defendant may be\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          38\n\n      found guilty * * * the defendant may be found guilty or not\n      guilty of any one or all the offenses charged.”\n\n      {¶72} As in Freeland, based on our review of the record, we find the\n\nevidence and testimony presented was simple and direct. And, we see\n\nnothing to indicate that the jury failed to follow the trial court's instructions.\n\nSee State v. Gibson, 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-13-1223 and L-13-1222, 2015-\n\nOhio-1679, at ¶ 30 (“Absent evidence to the contrary, we indulge the\n\npresumption that the jury followed the instructions of the trial court.”). In\n\nfact, we observe that the jury declined to return a guilty verdict on\n\nAppellant’s charge of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.\n\nThis gives us some indication that the jury considered each charge carefully\n\nand separately.\n\n      {¶73} Freeland further asserted that the State failed to satisfy the\n\n“other acts” test, and, thus, joinder of the offenses prejudiced him. We\n\ndetermined, however, that the State negated Freeland’s claimed prejudice by\n\nshowing that the evidence regarding each offense is simple and direct. Id. at\n\n17. The Supreme Court of Ohio held that “when simple and direct evidence\n\nexists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the\n\nnonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts' under Evid.R.\n\n404(B).” Lott, supra, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293. Thus, joinder\n\nof the offense was not prejudicial. Here, as in Freeland, even if we had\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         39\n\nfound the evidence of Appellant’s other offenses to have been inadmissible\n\nother acts, having found the evidence of offenses to be simple and direct,\n\njoinder of offenses for purposes of trial was not prejudicial to Appellant.\n\n      {¶74} Therefore, having found that joinder of the offenses was not\n\nprejudicial to Appellant, we further find that he was not rendered the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by his attorneys’ failure to file a motion to\n\nsever. Freeland also raised this argument on appeal. Freeland’s trial counsel\n\nhad filed a motion to sever the offenses, but did not file it in accordance with\n\nthe correct time limits. However, the trial court considered the merits of\n\nFreeland’s motion to sever and only cited trial counsel's failure to timely file\n\nthe motion as an additional reason for denying the motion.\n\n      {¶75} In Freeland, having determined that the trial court ultimately\n\nruled on the merits of his motion to sever, we failed to see how Freeland\n\nsuffered prejudice as a result of trial counsel's failure to timely file the\n\nmotion. We cited State v. Carr, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26661, 2014–Ohio–\n\n806, ¶ 25, wherein the appellate court rejected an ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim due to trial counsel's failure to renew motion to sever at the\n\nclose of the evidence when the record revealed no evidence that joinder of\n\noffenses prejudiced Carr.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          40\n\n      {¶76} Here, we have considered the merits of the severability\n\nargument and found that Appellant was not prejudiced by the offenses being\n\njoined at trial. Had Appellant’s counsel filed the motion to sever, the trial\n\ncourt reasonably could have reached the same conclusion and denied\n\nseverance. Therefore, we likewise fail to see how Appellant was rendered\n\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel’s failure to file a motion to\n\nsever which could reasonably have been denied.\n\n      {¶77} For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant was not rendered\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by his attorneys’ failure to file a motion to\n\nsever. As such, we find no merit to the second assignment of error.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n                                                  JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         41\n\nHarsha, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part:\n\n      {¶78} I conclude the trial court abused its discretion in finding the\n\nprobative value of T.S.’s other acts evidence was not substantially\n\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect in the context of this trial. The state\n\nalready had joined 15 counts of sexual abuse that the jury was going to hear.\n\nTo add additional evidence of similar conduct to that evidence went way too\n\nfar in my opinion.\n\n      {¶79} In all other regards I concur in judgment and opinion.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          42\n\n                           JUDGMENT ENTRY\n\n      It is ordered that the JUDGMENT BE AFFIRMED and costs be\nassessed to Appellant.\n\n      The Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n       It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing\nthe Jackson County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into\nexecution.\n\n       IF A STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE AND RELEASE\nUPON BAIL HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY THE TRIAL\nCOURT OR THIS COURT, it is temporarily continued for a period not to\nexceed sixty days upon the bail previously posted.

Wright was convicted\n\nof multiple counts of sexual battery, unlawful sexual conduct with a minor,\n\ngross sexual imposition, and rape. On appeal, Wright asserts: (1) his rights\n\nto due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court allowed the\n\nState to present overly prejudicial evidence of prior bad acts through a non-\n\nvictim witness; and (2) he was rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel\n\ndue to trial counsel’s failure to move to sever certain counts of the\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                     2\n\nindictment for purposes of trial. However, having reviewed the record\n\nherein, as well as the pertinent Ohio law, we find no merit to Wright’s\n\nassignments of error. Accordingly, we overrule both assignments of error\n\nand affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                   FACTS\n\n      {¶2} In February 2016, Appellant was indicted by the Jackson\n\nCounty Grand Jury as follows:\n\n      Count One           Sexual Battery, R.C. 2907.03(A)(12);\n\n      Count Two           Sexual Battery, R.C. 2907.03(A)(12);\n\n      Count Three         Unlawful Sexual Conduct with a Minor,\n                          R.C. 2907.04(A);\n\n      Count Four          Unlawful Sexual conduct with a Minor;\n                          R.C. 2907.04(A);\n\n      Count Five          Illegal Use of a Minor in Nudity-Oriented\n                          Material, R.C. 2907.323(A)(1);\n\n      Count Six           Gross Sexual Imposition, R.C. 2907.05(A)(1);\n\n      Count Seven         Gross Sexual Imposition, R.C. 2907.05(A)(1);\n\n      Count Eight         Gross Sexual Imposition, R.C. 2907.05(A)(1);\n\n      Count Nine          Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c);\n\n      Count Ten           Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2);\n\n      Count Eleven        Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c);\n\n      Count Twelve        Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2);\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                            3\n\n      Count Thirteen       Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c);\n\n      Count Fourteen       Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2); and,\n\n      Count Fifteen        Rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).\n\n      {¶3} At the time of the indictment, Appellant pastored a church in\n\nrural Jackson County. Appellant was married and had two adult sons. The\n\ncomplaining witnesses in the indictment were two of Appellant’s\n\ncongregants at the church, one a teenage female, and one a mentally\n\nchallenged adult female. The third complaining witness was one of\n\nAppellant’s sons, dating back to the complainant’s childhood.\n\n      {¶4} The indictment also contained sexually violent predator\n\nspecifications as to Counts 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Appellant was\n\nappointed counsel and entered not guilty pleas. The case eventually\n\nproceeded to jury trial which took place May 9 through May 16, 2016. Prior\n\nto trial, Appellant waived his right to trial on the sexually violent predator\n\nspecifications.\n\n      {¶5} The State’s theory of the case was Appellant abused his familiar\n\nrelationship with the victims and his authority as their pastor, and father, to\n\nperpetrate his criminal sexual activity. The defense strategy was to portray\n\nAppellant as a victim of lies and innuendo by complainants with ulterior\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                            4\n\nmotives of their own. Local media sources followed the case during the\n\npretrial and trial phases.\n\n      {¶6} At trial, the State presented testimony from M.S., a complaining\n\nwitness; Marjorie Norman, an eyewitness to one of the instances of abuse;\n\nM.S.’s twin sister; Deputy Urias Hall, an investigator for the Jackson County\n\nSheriff’s Office; T.R., another complaining witness; J.W., Appellant’s son\n\nand a complaining witness; Dr. Amy Luckeydoo, a pediatrician employed by\n\nthe Child Protection Center in Ross County, Ohio; Ashley Muse, a forensic\n\ninterviewer with the Child Protection Center; T.S., M.S.’s older sister; and,\n\nAgent Latisha Schuler of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and\n\nInvestigation. The State also offered two exhibits: a DVD of Ashley Muse’s\n\nforensic interview with M.S. and a recorded conversation between Agent\n\nSchuler and Appellant.\n\n      {¶7} When the State rested, defense counsel made a Crim.R. 29\n\nmotion to dismiss the charges due to insufficient evidence. The trial court\n\noverruled the motion. Appellant then presented testimony from his wife,\n\nDiana Wright. Appellant also testified on his own behalf. After the defense\n\nrested, both sides gave closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury,\n\nand the jury retired to deliberate.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                            5\n\n      {¶8} Appellant was subsequently convicted of all counts except count\n\nfive, illegal use of a minor in sexually oriented material. He was sentenced\n\nto consecutive sentences for all counts, and life imprisonment. This timely\n\nappeal followed. Where pertinent, additional facts will be set forth below.\n\n                         ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n      “I. MR. WRIGHT’S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A\n      FAIR TRIAL WERE VIOLATED WHEN THE TRIAL\n      COURT ALLOWED THE STATE TO PRESENT OVERLY\n      PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT PRIOR BAD ACTS\n      THROUGH A NON-VICTIM WITNESS.”\n\n                        A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      {¶9} The admission of other acts evidence lies within the broad\n\ndiscretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court will not disturb the trial\n\ncourt's decision in the absence of an abuse of that discretion.

The State\n\nfiled a motion to use Evid.R. 404(B) evidence to show Appellant’s motive,\n\npreparation, plan, and modus operandi.\n\n      {¶13} The State’s motion indicated T.S.’s testimony would be that\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         8\n\nbetween 2010 and 2011, when T.S. was 14 and 15 years old, Appellant\n\ntaught T.S. to drive a truck and used this opportunity to touch her breasts.\n\nThe State argued in doing so, Appellant used his role as T.S.’s pastor and\n\ntrusted family friend to gain access to her and sexually assault her. The\n\nState argued that Appellant used the same relationship with the victims as\n\ntheir pastor and trusted family friend to gain access to M.S., whom he also\n\ntaught to drive and also sexually assaulted by touching her breasts during the\n\n“lesson.” M.S. was almost the exact same age as T.S. when Appellant\n\nmolested her. The State concluded that in using the same relationship, the\n\nsame location, the same scheme, and the same sexual contact, the evidence\n\nadduced from T.S.’s testimony was admissible and relevant in the current\n\ncase pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) to show motive, preparation, plan, and\n\nmodus operandi in committing the sexual abuse against M.S.\n\n      {¶14} At a hearing to resolve pretrial motions, Appellant argued it\n\nwas highly prejudicial to allow T.S.’s testimony when she was not named as\n\na victim in any count of the indictment. However, by written decision, the\n\ntrial court announced it would be allowing T.S. to testify. The trial court\n\nrelied on the Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision in State v.

Herrington, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        9\n\n101322, 2015-Ohio-1820, finding that the factual scenario in Appellant’s\n\ncase was strikingly similar to the facts in Harrington.\n\n      {¶15} The first witness at Appellant’s trial was M.S., age 17. She\n\ntestified in the past, her family attended a church with Appellant, and she\n\nidentified Appellant. Appellant was the pastor and the congregation was a\n\nvery small group which included her family, Appellant’s family, and only a\n\nfew others.\n\n      {¶16} M.S. testified she sometimes went to Appellant’s farm to help\n\nhim clean stalls and feed the animals. At times, Appellant bought her candy,\n\nfood, and clothing. When M.S. was 10-13 years old, Appellant began\n\ntalking to her about sex and “how it would feel.” He also touched her\n\nbreasts and vagina under her clothing. When he put his hands on her, she\n\nwould tell him to stop and try to shrug him away or try to get her clothes\n\nback. He told her “it would make him love again and all that but that he\n\nloves me.”\n\n      {¶17} On occasion, Appellant would get on top of M.S. on the floor\n\nof his bedroom. Once he put his penis on her vagina and it hurt. He also\n\nasked her at times to touch his penis with her hand. She felt “awkward and\n\n“really didn’t want to.” M.S. testified she was forced to do it, “He kept\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         10\n\nnagging and riding me until I did it.” One time, he had her put her mouth on\n\nhis penis. Afterwards she cried and complained she was sick.\n\n      {¶18} M.S. further testified that Appellant let her drive his truck to\n\npractice. He told her he would help her get her license “if I do stuff with\n\nhim.” M.S. testified she did not tell anyone what was happening because\n\nshe was scared and because her father did not “believe other victims when it\n\nhappened.” She also testified that on occasion, after doing the farm chores,\n\nM.S. would take a shower at Appellant’s house. Sometimes Appellant\n\nwould come in, open the door to look at her, and take pictures of her naked\n\nbody on his phone. M.S. later deleted them.\n\n      {¶19} The instances of abuse began when M.S. was 10-13 years old.\n\nThey occurred numerous times until she was 15 or 16 years old.\n\n      {¶20} On the fourth day of trial, T.S., now age 20, testified a handful\n\nof people, which included her family, attended the church where Appellant\n\npastored. T.S. testified when she was 14 or 15 years old, she was at\n\nAppellant’s house, in his truck, and he asked her if she wanted to learn to\n\ndrive. When they switched places in the truck and T.S. was driving, he told\n\nher “This is what young boys will do.” T.S. testified:\n\n      “He stuck his arm around… he stuck his arm around my\n      shoulders and tried to stick it down my shirt and I said no then\n      he stuck it around me and tried to stick it down the front and\n      back of my pants and I said no and I stopped him.”\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          11\n\n      {¶21} Prior to T.S.’s testimony, Appellant’s counsel renewed the\n\nobjection. At the close of trial, the court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n      “Evidence was admitted of other acts which the defendant may\n      have committed. You may not consider that evidence to\n      determine whether the defendant committed any act alleged in\n      the indictment. If you find from other evidence that the\n      defendant committed the acts charged in the indictment, then\n      you may consider the evidence of the other act as bearing upon\n      the defendant’s motive, preparation, plan, and modus\n      operandi.”\n\n      {¶22} Based upon our review of the facts herein and the pertinent\n\ncase law, we find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court’s ruling\n\nwhich allowed the State to present evidence of other acts through T.S.’s\n\ntestimony.\n\n      {¶23} In Williams, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio was asked to\n\ndetermine whether evidence that the defendant had a prior sexual\n\nrelationship with an underage boy, A.B., he coached in the 1990s was\n\nproperly admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) in the State's prosecution of\n\nthe defendant for sex offenses committed in 2008 against a different\n\nunderage boy, J.H., that the defendant was mentoring. Id. The Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an\n\naccused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be\n\nadmissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B)—to\n\nshow proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          12\n\nidentity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Id. at ¶ 19. The court set forth a\n\nthree-step analysis that courts should conduct in determining the\n\nadmissibility of other acts evidence. Id. First, the court should “consider\n\nwhether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it\n\nwould be without the evidence.” Id. at ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, the\n\ncourt should “consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts\n\nis presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in\n\nconformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a\n\nlegitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).” Id. Third, the\n\ncourt should “consider whether the probative value of the other acts\n\nevidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” Id.,\n\nciting Evid.R. 403.\n\n      {¶24} In Williams, applying the three-part test, the Court determined\n\nthat the other acts evidence related to the defendant's conduct and\n\nrelationship with A.B. and was properly admitted in accordance with\n\nEvid.R. 404(B) as it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the\n\npart of the defendant. Id. at ¶ 24 –25. With respect to the first step of the\n\ncourt's three-part test, the court found that A.B.'s testimony was relevant\n\n“because it tended to show the motive [the defendant] had and the\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          13\n\npreparation and plan he exhibited of targeting, mentoring, grooming, and\n\nabusing teenage boys.” Id. at ¶ 22. Further, A.B.'s testimony “rebutted the\n\nsuggestion offered by the defense during opening statements that J.H. had\n\nfalsely accused [the defendant] of abuse with the hope of getting out of\n\ntrouble at school and the suggestion that [the defendant] was sexually\n\nattracted to women.” Id. As for the second part of the test, the court noted\n\nthat the evidence of the defendant's relationship with A.B. was not offered to\n\nshow that abusing J.H. was in conformity with the defendant's character. Id.\n\nat ¶ 23. “In fact, the trial court gave two limiting instructions that this\n\nevidence was not being offered to prove [the defendant's] character—one\n\njust prior to the testimony of A.B. and one prior to deliberation.” Id. Finally,\n\nwith respect to the third part of the test, the court found that the evidence\n\nwas not unduly prejudicial given the limiting instructions provided to the\n\njury. Id. at ¶ 24. “[T]he trial court instructed the jury that this evidence\n\ncould not be considered to show that [the defendant] had acted in conformity\n\nwith a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of\n\nA.B.'s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.'s testimony about the sexual\n\nabuse, which had been denied by [the defendant].” Id.\n\n      {¶25} In State v. Powih, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2016-11-023,\n\n2017-Ohio-7208, the appellate court found the facts therein to be similar to\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        14\n\nWilliams and, after applying the three-part test, concluded that the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in permitting the other acts evidence. The court\n\nfound the testimony of the uninindicted complainant in Powih was relevant\n\nas it tended to show the appellant's motive, intent, and plan of targeting and\n\nsexually assaulting female nursing aides in their mid-twenties who were\n\nisolated in a resident's room while caring for elderly patients who lacked\n\nawareness of what was occurring around them. The challenged other acts\n\ntestimony was also relevant to prove the absence of mistake and to rebut the\n\nsuggestion offered by the defense during opening statements that A.H.\n\nconsented to sexual contact with the appellant before falsely accusing the\n\nappellant of assaulting her because she did not want to accept responsibility\n\nfor her actions. Id. at ¶ 27.\n\n       {¶26} In this case, the trial court’s decision allowing T.S.’s testimony\n\nalso cited State v. Herrington. There Herrington was indicted and charged\n\nwith multiple counts of gross sexual imposition, one count of kidnapping,\n\nand one count of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or\n\nperformance. Prior to Herrington’s trial, the court addressed appellant's\n\npretrial motions to exclude other acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n       {¶27} The evidence involved Herrington’s prior acts against a 19-\n\nyear-old victim, A.H., in 1995. Before the jury was selected, the trial court\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        15\n\nstated that it would permit A.H. to testify but that evidence of the appellant's\n\nprior conviction would not be admitted. The matter proceeded to jury trial\n\nin March, 2014.\n\n      {¶28} A.H., then 37 years old, testified she knew Herrington from the\n\ntime of her birth. A.H.'s father and Herrington were “best friends” and both\n\nserved as associate ministers at their church. A.H. testified that in 1995,\n\nHerrington approached her at her parents’ home and offered to give her\n\ndriving lessons. A.H. accepted his offer because she wanted to get her\n\ndriver’s license and was excited for the opportunity to learn how to drive.\n\nOver the course of approximately one month, Herrington took A.H. for\n\ndriving lessons on three separate occasions. After the last driving lesson,\n\nHerrington suddenly kissed A.H., placed her on a couch, got on top of her\n\nand forced her to have sexual intercourse. She stated, “I tried to push him\n\noff, but I couldn't get him off of me.”\n\n      {¶29} T.B., Herrington’s current victim, was 20 years old at the time\n\nof trial. She testified that she first met Herrington when he began a romantic\n\nrelationship with her grandmother when T.B. was approximately 7 or 8 years\n\nold. On separate occasions, T.B. lived with Herrington and her\n\ngrandmother. T.B. testified about several incidents when she was\n\ninappropriately touched by Herrington in her grandmother’s home.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                       16\n\nHowever, several incidents occurred after Herrington offered to provide T.B.\n\ndriving lessons when she was 15 years old. After the first driving lesson,\n\nT.B. went up to her bedroom. Herrington followed her to her bedroom and\n\nsaid he needed to “check [her] pulse” because “she seemed nervous and\n\ntense.” Herrington claimed that he had to check T.B.'s pulse on her chest\n\nand had her take her shirt off. Appellant then “cupped” her breast over her\n\nbra.\n\n       {¶30} Approximately two or three weeks later, Herrington offered to\n\ngive T.B. a second driving lesson. While in the vehicle, Herrington warned\n\nT.B. not to tell anyone about the driving lessons. When they returned home,\n\nT.B. went upstairs to her bedroom and Herrington followed her. Again,\n\nHerrington asked if he could check her pulse. On this occasion, Herrington\n\nhad T.B. take off her pants so he could check her pulse by touching her inner\n\nleg. T.B. testified that she complied and Herrington placed two fingers on\n\nher inner thigh and “brushed” his hand over her “private parts.”\n\n       {¶31} One month later, Herrington told T.B. that he was going to\n\ndrive to Akron and that he would let her drive on the freeway if she wanted\n\nto join him. T.B. agreed to go along. When they returned home, Herrington\n\nfollowed T.B. upstairs to her bedroom and began to give her a massage\n\nbecause he thought she “looked tense.” Herrington then asked her to take\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                        17\n\nher shirt off. T.B. testified that she complied because they were alone and\n\nshe did not know what would happen if she told him no. T.B. stated that\n\nHerrington continued to give her a massage while she was lying face down\n\non the bed. Herrington then unclasped her bra and took off her pants. T.B.\n\ntestified that Herrington “moved” her underwear to the side and “separated\n\n[her] privates” with his fingers. T.B. closed her legs and Herrington went\n\ndownstairs shortly thereafter.\n\n      {¶32} The Herrington court was guided by the Supreme Court’s\n\nanalysis in Williams. The Herrington court applied the three-step analysis,\n\nreasoning as follows at ¶ 33:\n\n     “With regard to the first and second steps of the Williams test,\n     we find A.H.'s testimony was relevant and was presented for a\n     legitimate purpose under Evid.R. 404(B). Similar to the factual\n     scenario in Williams, appellant's relationship and interaction with\n     A.H. and T.B. were similar in character and method.\n     Collectively, A.H.'s testimony demonstrated appellant's motives\n     and the preparation and plan he exhibited, i.e., offering teenage\n     girls driving lessons and manipulating their confidence and trust\n     for his own sexual gratification. In our view, if believed by the\n     jury, such testimony could corroborate portions of T.B.'s\n     testimony. See Williams at ¶ 22.”\n\n     {¶33} The Herrington court, as did the court in Williams, also\n\nelaborated on the fact the trial court gave limiting instructions that the\n\nevidence was not being offered to prove appellant's character. Citing the\n\nsame authorities as Williams, the Herrington court further recognized the\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                      18\n\npresumption that the jury followed those instructions. Finally, the\n\nHerrington court considered whether the probative value of the other acts\n\nevidence of the prior relationship with A.H. was substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice. The Herrington court held:\n\n      “In our view, the challenged evidence is not unduly prejudicial\n      because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence\n      could not be considered to show that appellant had acted in\n      conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the\n      prejudicial effect of A.H.'s testimony, and A.H. corroborated\n      T.B.'s testimony about appellant's pattern of conduct, which had\n      been denied by appellant. Thus, Evid.R. 404(B) permitted\n      admission of evidence of appellant's prior crime because it\n      helped to prove appellant's motive, preparation, and plan.\n      Accordingly, the prejudicial effect did not substantially\n      outweigh the probative value of that evidence.”\n\n      {¶34} We begin the three-step analysis by considering whether the\n\nother acts evidence through T.S.’s testimony is relevant to establishing any\n\nfact that is of consequence. M.S.’s testimony regarding the sexual abuse\n\nwhich she endured is set forth above fully. She testified the abuse began\n\nwhen she was 10-13 years old and ended when she was 15-16 years old.\n\nAppellant was M.S.’s pastor and family friend. She testified Appellant\n\nbought her candy, food, and clothes. He also let her drive his truck and\n\npromised to help her get her driver’s license if she engaged in sexual\n\nactivities with him or allowed him to touch her.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         19\n\n      {¶35} Having reviewed M.S.’s testimony, we find T.S.’s testimony\n\nwas relevant to establishing a fact of consequence. In both cases, the abuse\n\noccurred when the teenage girls were the age to be interested in driving, and\n\nthe sexual abuse occurred during driving lessons or was endured for the sake\n\nof driving lessons. T.S.’s testimony, if believed, tended to corroborate\n\nM.S.’s testimony that at least part of the abuse she experienced occurred at\n\napproximately the same age and under the same pretextual assistance with\n\ndriving lessons.\n\n      {¶36} We also consider whether the other acts evidence is presented\n\nfor a legitimate purpose. Here, we find T.S.’s testimony was relevant to\n\nestablish Appellant’s motive, preparation, and plan. In both instances,\n\nAppellant took advantage of his relationship with the girls’ families and as\n\nthe girls’ pastor, in order to gain their trust. The reasonable inference is that\n\nhis motive was sexual gratification. It is also reasonable to infer that he\n\nplanned and prepared to sexually abuse them by either getting them in a\n\nvulnerable position in his truck with him for driving lessons, or using the\n\ndriving lessons as a “carrot” to get M.S. to agree to submit to unwanted\n\nsexual conduct. As in Herrington, Appellant’s relationship and interaction\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                                                      20\n\nwith teenage girls was similar in character and method. T.S.’s testimony\n\ndemonstrated Appellant’s motives, preparation, and the plan exhibited.1\n\n         {¶37} Finally, we consider whether the probative value of the other\n\nacts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nHere, the trial court’s ruling announced that it would give a limiting\n\ninstruction. The trial court then gave its limiting instruction during the\n\nclosing portion of trial, but not prior to T.S.’s testimony. And, the transcript\n\nis devoid of any request for a limiting instruction by Appellant.\n\n         {¶38} In Powih, supra, the trial court gave two limiting instructions\n\nregarding other acts testimony. Just prior to allowing the challenged\n\ntestimony, the court advised the jury as follows:\n\n         “Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to hear evidence\n         concerning a separate alleged incident, in May 2016, involving\n         Mr. Powih. This evidence is only being offered and may only\n         be considered by you in determining whether Mr. Powih had a\n         common scheme, a plan, or a system in engaging in the conduct\n         alleged in determining Mr. Powih's preparation, motive, intent,\n         or absence of mistake or accident, in engaging in the alleged\n         misconduct, with the alleged victim, in this present case.\n         You may not—again, you may not consider this evidence as\n         proof of Mr. Powih's character, in order to show that he acted in\n         conformity with that character.”\n\n\n1\n  See also State v. Shank, 9th Dist. Mahoning No. 12CA0104-M, 2013-Ohio-5368, ¶19 (As in Williams,\n[witnesses’] testimony was relevant because it tended to show Shank's motive and plan of targeting for\nsexual activity teenage girls who spent the night at his house after drinking alcohol. As the trial court noted,\n[the witnesses’ testimony was “highly probative of whether [Shank] acted in conformity with a plan or a\npurpose or an intent to commit these sexual offenses against [the complaining witness.].”)\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                                                21\n\n        {¶39} Then, prior to the jury's deliberation, the court provided a\n\nsecond limiting instruction to the jury regarding the other acts evidence. The\n\nPowih court noted the presumption that the jury followed the court's\n\ninstructions and did not consider the other acts testimony to show that Powih\n\nwas acting in conformity with bad character. 2\n\n        {¶40} In State v. Landers, 2nd Dist. Greene No. 2015-CA-74, 2017-\n\nOhio-1194, Landers argued that the trial court erred by failing to give a\n\ncontemporaneous instruction when the unindicted witness testified about the\n\n“other acts” evidence. However, the Landers court noted that the “other\n\nacts” testimony presented was not extensive, and a limiting instruction was\n\ngiven. Id. at 65. The Landers court also recognized an earlier decision in\n\nState v. Shaw, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 21880, 2008–Ohio–1317, wherein\n\nthe court stated: “[t]he limiting instruction should be given at the time the\n\n‘other acts’ evidence is received, [State v.] Lewis, supra, [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3749964\"><a href=\"/opinion/3996453/state-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2nd Dist.1990) ] * * *.

The Landers court\n\nconcluded the trial court did not err in failing to give the instruction at the\n\ntime the witness testified, emphasizing that the trial court did give a limiting\n\ninstruction and the presumption that the jury followed its instructions.\n\n      {¶41} Similarly, in State v. Rodrigues, 10th Dist. Franklin No.\n\n95APA06-683, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">146063</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mar. 26, 1996), Rodrigues faulted the\n\ntrial court for not instructing the jury that other acts evidence was to be\n\nconsidered for a limited purpose only and not as substantive evidence of his\n\nguilt. The Rodrigues court duly noted Rodrigues did not request such an\n\ninstruction and thus waived all but plain error. The Rodrigues court opined\n\ntrial court's failure to sua sponte issue a limiting instruction to the jury with\n\nrespect to the other acts evidence would not have clearly changed the\n\noutcome of the proceedings. Moreover, Rodrigues recognized the Supreme\n\nCourt of Ohio’s decision in State v. Schaim, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1992-Ohio-\n\n31, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in rejecting a defendant's claim that it was plain error\n\nfor a trial court to fail to give a limiting instruction on the use of other acts\n\nevidence, which stated:\n\n      “[T]he decision not to request a limiting instruction is\n      sometimes a tactical one, and we do not wish to impose a duty\n      on the trial courts to read this instruction when it is not\n      requested.” Schaim, supra, at 61-62, fn. 9.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                       23\n\n      {¶42} Here, we find the probative value of T.S.’s other acts testimony\n\nis not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nAppellant’s counsel did not request a limiting instruction prior to T.S.’s\n\ntestimony, which may or may not have been a tactical decision. However,\n\nthe trial court gave a limiting instruction along with the closing jury\n\ninstructions. As in Williams and the numerous other cases cited, we\n\npresume the jury followed the court’s instruction.\n\n      {¶43} Having engaged in the three-step analysis, we find the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in allowing T.S.’s testimony regarding\n\nother acts of the Appellant. As such, we find no merit to the first assignment\n\nof error and accordingly, it is hereby overruled.\n\n      “II. MR.

LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n      {¶47} At a pretrial hearing, defense counsel indicated a motion to\n\nsever would “probably” be filed. However, this filing did not occur.\n\nAppellant argues the indictment against him was based on allegations that he\n\nsexually assaulted three different individuals over the course of nearly 26\n\nyears. He argues while there are some similarities between the accounts as\n\ntold by the alleged victims, there were also significant differences.\n\nAppellant points out the allegation by Appellant’s son, supposedly occurring\n\nin 1989 and 1990, differed from the conduct alleged by the teenage female\n\nvictims in 2012-2015 and 2009-2010. Appellant argues the cumulative\n\nnature of the allegations caused him prejudice, and furthermore, if counsel\n\nhad requested severance, it is likely that it would have been granted and the\n\noutcome of his trials would have been different. Appellant concludes the\n\nfailure of his counsel to move to sever the counts pertaining to each of the\n\nalleged victims resulted in his being deprived of due process and a fair trial.\n\n       {¶48} Crim.R. 8(A) permits an indictment to charge two or more\n\noffenses “in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * *\n\nare of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or\n\ntransaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected\n\ntogether or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          27\n\ncourse of criminal conduct.” The law favors joining same or similar\n\noffenses in order to “conserve [ ] judicial and prosecutorial time, lessen[ ]\n\nthe not inconsiderable expenses of multiple trials, diminish[ ] inconvenience\n\nto witnesses, and minimize[ ] the possibility of incongruous results in\n\nsuccessive trials before different juries.” State v.

We\n\nhave set forth the standard of review applicable to an abuse of discretion\n\nargument above.\n\n      {¶50} In response to Appellant’s argument, the State argues that\n\nAppellant was not prejudiced by the decision not to file a motion to sever.\n\nThe State contends the evidence of each offense was simple, distinct, and\n\nunlikely to confuse a jury. The State contends the evidence of other acts\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts had been severed.

We observed that “the State presented simple and\n\ndirect testimony from three different individuals who described distinct and\n\nseparate acts that Appellant allegedly committed against them.” Id. J.F., a\n\ntwenty-two year old female, described sexual acts that occurred when she\n\nwas a young child living with Freeland, who was her step-father.

On Sundays,\n\nafter church, she would go home with Appellant and work in the barn until\n\ngoing back to church Sunday evening.

She testified she never told anybody about Appellant’s\n\nabuse because she was “scared to death.” She admitted that when Appellant\n\nhit her, she did not have bruising.\n\n      {¶65} T.R. testified that when Appellant’s wife overheard the\n\ncommotion, she screamed “Oh, oh this done ruined everything. He ruined\n\nmy life.” T.R. denied leaving her mother’s house to get away from abuse by\n\nher mother. She testified Appellant took her pills and she had seizure\n\nactivity. When she has seizures, she sits and stares.\n\n      {¶66} On redirect, T.R. explained that she cannot remember what\n\nhappens during a seizure, but it does not make her forget other things.\n\n      {¶67} The sexual abuse M.S. and T.R. described was different from\n\nthat suffered by the third victim, Appellant’s son J.W. J.W., age 37, testified\n\nhe grew up in a very strict household. His father would punish him by\n\nbeating him with a horse whip, ball bats, a water hose, a chunk of wood, or\n\n“whatever” was nearby. When J.W. was 9 or 10, his father would touch\n\nJ.W.’s penis in the shower or the bedroom. Usually, after a spanking, his\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                      36\n\nfather would throw him back into bed and caress him in an inappropriate\n\nway. Appellant would touch his anus and insert his fingers. J.W. never told\n\nanyone and over the years, Appellant eventually quit abusing him.\n\n      {¶68} J.W. testified Agent Schuler sought him out and questioned\n\nhim. J.W. testified he and his wife were staying at Appellant’s house during\n\n2009-2010. One night, he heard a noise and went into the living room and\n\nsaw T.R. “giving my dad a blow job.” Appellant ran into the bedroom. J.W.\n\nconfronted him and hit him in the mouth. J.W. was also upset with T.R.\n\nHowever, J.W. did not report the incident. J.W. does not have a relationship\n\nwith T.R. J.W. admitted he had a misdemeanor conviction for falsification.\n\n      {¶69} On cross-examination, J.W. described T.R. as follows: “I\n\ndidn’t think she was all there. I thought something might have been wrong\n\nwith her * * * mentally.” However, he also testified she could cook, help\n\nmow, and he thought she knew right from wrong. J.W. also admitted when\n\nhe was 13 or 14, he was removed from the home because his parents could\n\nnot control him.\n\n      {¶70} We find the evidence presented by the State’s three\n\ncomplaining witnesses to be simple and direct. While there are some\n\nsimilarities, such as the fact M.S. and T.R. knew Appellant through church,\n\nand that M.S. and T.R. both performed farm chores for Appellant, each\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          37\n\nwitness testified to his or her own experiences. The three witnesses’\n\ntestimony regarding their own unwanted sexual encounters was detailed and\n\nstraightforward. We also note, as a matter of the presentation of evidence,\n\nthere were other witnesses that testified between M.S. and T.R., and then\n\nbetween T.R. and J.W. The only overlap in testimony occurred when J.W.\n\ntestified he walked in on the sexual activity between Appellant and T.R.,\n\nhowever we do not find that overlap to be significant.\n\n      {¶71} In Freeland, we also observed that courts have held that any\n\nprejudice that results from the joinder of offenses is minimized when a trial\n\ncourt cautions a jury before deliberations to consider each count, and the\n\nevidence applicable to each count separately, and to state its findings as to\n\neach count uninfluenced by its verdict on any other counts. Freeland, supra,\n\nat 16; State v. Gibson, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L–13–1223 and L–13–1222,\n\n2015–Ohio–1679, ¶ 30; State v. Meeks, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA17,\n\n2015-Ohio-1527, at ¶ 99; State v. Hillman, 2014-Ohio-5760, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1236</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Dist.), at ¶ 40. Here, at Appellant’s trial during closing, the trial\n\ncourt instructed:\n\n      “The charges set forth in each count in the indictment\n      constitutes a separate and distinct matter. You must consider\n      each count and the evidence applicable to each count separately\n      and you must state your finding as to each count uninfluenced\n      by your verdict as to any other count. The defendant may be\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          38\n\n      found guilty * * * the defendant may be found guilty or not\n      guilty of any one or all the offenses charged.”\n\n      {¶72} As in Freeland, based on our review of the record, we find the\n\nevidence and testimony presented was simple and direct. And, we see\n\nnothing to indicate that the jury failed to follow the trial court's instructions.\n\nSee State v. Gibson, 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-13-1223 and L-13-1222, 2015-\n\nOhio-1679, at ¶ 30 (“Absent evidence to the contrary, we indulge the\n\npresumption that the jury followed the instructions of the trial court.”). In\n\nfact, we observe that the jury declined to return a guilty verdict on\n\nAppellant’s charge of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.\n\nThis gives us some indication that the jury considered each charge carefully\n\nand separately.\n\n      {¶73} Freeland further asserted that the State failed to satisfy the\n\n“other acts” test, and, thus, joinder of the offenses prejudiced him. We\n\ndetermined, however, that the State negated Freeland’s claimed prejudice by\n\nshowing that the evidence regarding each offense is simple and direct. Id. at\n\n17. The Supreme Court of Ohio held that “when simple and direct evidence\n\nexists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the\n\nnonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts' under Evid.R.\n\n404(B).” Lott, supra, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus, joinder\n\nof the offense was not prejudicial. Here, as in Freeland, even if we had\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         39\n\nfound the evidence of Appellant’s other offenses to have been inadmissible\n\nother acts, having found the evidence of offenses to be simple and direct,\n\njoinder of offenses for purposes of trial was not prejudicial to Appellant.\n\n      {¶74} Therefore, having found that joinder of the offenses was not\n\nprejudicial to Appellant, we further find that he was not rendered the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by his attorneys’ failure to file a motion to\n\nsever. Freeland also raised this argument on appeal. Freeland’s trial counsel\n\nhad filed a motion to sever the offenses, but did not file it in accordance with\n\nthe correct time limits. However, the trial court considered the merits of\n\nFreeland’s motion to sever and only cited trial counsel's failure to timely file\n\nthe motion as an additional reason for denying the motion.\n\n      {¶75} In Freeland, having determined that the trial court ultimately\n\nruled on the merits of his motion to sever, we failed to see how Freeland\n\nsuffered prejudice as a result of trial counsel's failure to timely file the\n\nmotion. We cited State v. Carr, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26661, 2014–Ohio–\n\n806, ¶ 25, wherein the appellate court rejected an ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim due to trial counsel's failure to renew motion to sever at the\n\nclose of the evidence when the record revealed no evidence that joinder of\n\noffenses prejudiced Carr.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          40\n\n      {¶76} Here, we have considered the merits of the severability\n\nargument and found that Appellant was not prejudiced by the offenses being\n\njoined at trial. Had Appellant’s counsel filed the motion to sever, the trial\n\ncourt reasonably could have reached the same conclusion and denied\n\nseverance. Therefore, we likewise fail to see how Appellant was rendered\n\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel’s failure to file a motion to\n\nsever which could reasonably have been denied.\n\n      {¶77} For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant was not rendered\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by his attorneys’ failure to file a motion to\n\nsever. As such, we find no merit to the second assignment of error.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n                                                  JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                         41\n\nHarsha, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part:\n\n      {¶78} I conclude the trial court abused its discretion in finding the\n\nprobative value of T.S.’s other acts evidence was not substantially\n\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect in the context of this trial. The state\n\nalready had joined 15 counts of sexual abuse that the jury was going to hear.\n\nTo add additional evidence of similar conduct to that evidence went way too\n\nfar in my opinion.\n\n      {¶79} In all other regards I concur in judgment and opinion.\n\fJackson App. No. 16CA3                                                          42\n\n                           JUDGMENT ENTRY\n\n      It is ordered that the JUDGMENT BE AFFIRMED and costs be\nassessed to Appellant.\n\n      The Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n       It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing\nthe Jackson County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into\nexecution.\n\n       IF A STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE AND RELEASE\nUPON BAIL HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY THE TRIAL\nCOURT OR THIS COURT, it is temporarily continued for a period not to\nexceed sixty days upon the bail previously posted. The purpose of a\ncontinued stay is to allow Appellant to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio\nan application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court. If\na stay is continued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the\nexpiration of the sixty day period, or the failure of the Appellant to file a\nnotice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio in the forty-five day appeal\nperiod pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme\nCourt of Ohio. Additionally, if the Supreme Court of Ohio dismisses the\nappeal prior to expiration of sixty days, the stay will terminate as of the date\nof such dismissal.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to\nRule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nAbele, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\nHarsha, J.: Dissents in Part and Concurs in Part with Opinion.\n\n                                        For the Court,\n\n                                 BY: ______________________________\n                                     Matthew W.
