We disagree and therefore will reverse.\n\n            I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n        The LTSU was established at SCI Pittsburgh in April 2000\nas a place to confine a small population of inmates1 which the DOC\nviews, because of their history of behavior in prison, as too\ndisruptive, violent or problematic to house elsewhere.2 Inmates are\nclassified at “Level 2” when admitted to the Unit, must remain\nthere a minimum of 90 days, and may remain at Level 2\nindefinitely. The length of time a prisoner may spend in the LTSU\nis open-ended and subject to the discretion of prison personnel.\n\n       Department policy prohibits Level 2 prisoners from\nreceiving newspapers or magazines directly from the publisher,\nfrom the prison library, or from any other source for the duration\nof their confinement at Level 2 status unless the publication is\nreligious or legal in nature. Individual articles clipped from\npublications are prohibited, unless they relate to the inmate or his\nfamily. Also prohibited is the possession or receipt of photographs\nof spouses, other family members, or friends.\n\n1\n The maximum population in the LTSU is 40. (App. 92)\nDeposition testimony in this case discloses that, during the relevant\nperiod, the LTSU population was comprised of 36 Level 2 and\nthree Level 1 inmates. (App. 93)\n2\n The relevant DOC regulations state: “Any inmate who is, has or\nmay be planning to engage in the following activities may be\nappropriate for assignment in the LTSU: (1) inmates who fail to\ncomplete SMU [Special Management Unit]; (2) serious escape\nhistory; (3) assaultive behavior with the intent to cause death or\nserious bodily injury; (4) injury to staff and/or inmates; (5)\nengaging in facility disturbance(s); (6) recorded history of exerting\nnegative influence in facility activities; (7) Security Threat Group\n(STG) member or other unauthorized organization(s); (8)\nPerpetuated criminal activity that threatens the community; (9) a\nhistory of being a sexual predator; and/or (10) possessing weapons\nand/or implements of escape.” 6.5.1 Administration of Security\nLevel 5 Housing Units Procedure Manual at 1-16.\n                                  3\n\f       Other DOC rules which govern life at LTSU Level 2\nprohibit inmates from having radios or televisions, permit phone\ncalls only in emergencies or when related to inmates’ legal\nrepresentation, limit inmates to one visit with an immediate family\nmember per month, and require inmates to remain in their cells 23\nhours a day, one inmate to a cell. Inmates are permitted, however,\nreligious or legal publications and paperback books that can be\nordered from the prison library. To review legal materials, one\nLTSU inmate at a time may be let out of his cell and is escorted\nfrom it to a “mini law library” in hand and leg irons by two\ncorrections officers. (App. 11)\n\n        The policy challenged here is unique in the state prison\nsystem, even among other segregated inmates. Level 1 LTSU\ninmates are permitted one subscription newspaper in their cells\nwhich can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis and are also\npermitted five subscription magazines at any given time.3\nDepartment policy also authorizes Special Management Unit\n(“SMU”) inmates (another class of segregated inmates identified\nas being among the most difficult inmates in the system) to have\nvarious numbers of subscription newspapers, magazines and\nphotographs in their cells, depending on their classification level.\n(App. 77) Similarly, dangerous inmates who are segregated in the\nDepartment’s regular Restrictive Housing Unit on Administrative\nCustody status for security reasons are permitted one subscription\nnewspaper in their cells which can be exchanged on a one-for-one\nbasis, as well as subscription magazines and up to 10 photographs.\n\n       Deputy Superintendent Joel Dickson, who supervises the\nLTSU, testified in his deposition that the prohibition serves several\npenological purposes, which were reiterated by the defendant in its\nbriefs. First, and emphasized by Dickson as most important, is\nbehavior modification and rehabilitation. Dickson explained that\nin Level 2, inmates are deprived of certain privileges to create an\nincentive to comply with prison rules and thereby be removed to\nLevel 1 and eventually to the general population. Among Level 1\ninmates, the prospect of having the privileges denied discourages\nbacksliding. Also, Dickson explained that as inmates improve their\n\n\n3\n    The photograph prohibition, however, remains unchanged.\n                                  4\n\fbehavior to earn privileges, they become better integrated members\nof prison society or, if released, better members of free society and\n“more productive citizen[s].” (App. 111) Second, the less material\nLevel 2 prisoners have in their cells, the easier it is for correctional\noffices to detect concealed contraband and provide security. Third,\nnewspapers and magazines can be rolled up and used as blow guns\nor spears, can fuel cell fires, or can be used as crude tools to\ncatapult feces at the guards.\n\n        Plaintiff Ronald Banks filed the Complaint in this action on\nOctober 18, 2001. Seeking equitable and declaratory relief, the\nComplaint challenged the constitutionality of the DOC policy that\ndenies Level 2 inmates access to newspapers, magazines and\nphotographs of family members and friends. The inmates argued\nthat, under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), the policy offends\ntheir right to free speech either because it bears no rational\nconnection to any legitimate penological interest or because it is an\nexaggerated response to such an interest. A motion for class\ncertification was filed and granted on March 22, 2002. After\ndiscovery was completed, the parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment in September of 2002.\n\n       On November 15, 2002, Magistrate Judge Robert Mitchell\nrecommended granting summary judgment to the DOC. The\nrecommendation reasoned that the Turner factors weighed in the\nDOC’s favor and that the policy was rationally related to, and\nfurthered the legitimate penological interests of, institutional\nsecurity and prisoner rehabilitation. Despite Banks’ objections, on\nJanuary 10, 2003 the magistrate’s recommendation and reasoning\nwere adopted by order of the District Court.\n\n       The District Court reasoned first that the policy is not an\nimpermissible First Amendment violation because it is rationally\nrelated to the legitimate and interrelated penological interests in\nrehabilitation and security. It encourages compliance with prison\nrules and deprives especially incorrigible prisoners of material\nfrom which they can fashion crude weapons or feed cell fires.\n\n      Second, the District Court held that the policy is not an\nexaggerated response to the stated penological concerns. The court\nagreed with the DOC that inmates can meaningfully exercise the\nburdened First Amendment rights by qualifying with good\n                                   5\n\fbehavior for promotion to Level 1 or by corresponding with family\nand friends. Furthermore, given the particular intractability of\nLevel 2 inmates, any further accommodation of their rights would\nimpose costs that cannot be characterized as only de minimus. 4\nBanks timely appealed the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment.\n\n            II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The District Court had original jurisdiction over the action\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1343 because the claim asserts a violation\nof the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This Court has\nappellate jurisdiction over the order of the District Court granting\nsummary judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de\nnovo the District Court’s decision to grant the DOC’s motion for\nsummary judgment. See Sutton v. Rasheed, 323 F.3d 236, 248 (3d\nCir. 2003). In reviewing the record, we view the evidence and any\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty, and resolve all factual conflicts in its favor. We reverse the\nDistrict Court’s decision where there are genuine issues of material\nfact precluding judgment as a matter of law. See Suders v. Easton,\n325 F.3d 432, 440 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n                          III. Discussion\n\n       A.     The Turner Standard\n\n        We have repeatedly echoed the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition that “prison walls do not form a barrier separating\nprison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.” Ramirez\nv. Pugh, 379 F.3d 122, 126 (3d Cir. 2004); Fraise v. Terhune, 283\nF.3d 506, 515 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 84). In\nTurner, the Supreme Court acknowledged, however, that inmates’\nconstitutional rights may in some cases be limited, and held that a\nprison regulation that impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights “is\n\n\n\n\n4\n Here, the DOC asserts the existence of the “ripple effect,” cited in\nTurner, as a magnifier of cost in the prison environment. 482 U.S.\nat 90.\n                                  6\n\fvalid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”\n482 U.S. at 89.5\n\n        The Supreme Court articulated an analytical framework\nwithin which the reasonableness of such a regulation is assessed by\nweighing four factors. First, there must be a “valid, rational\nconnection between the prison regulation and the legitimate\ngovernmental interest put forward to justify it.” Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 89 (quotations omitted). Second, the court must determine\n“whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that\nremain open to prison inmates.” Id. at 90. Third, the court must\nassess “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates” and prison resources\ngenerally. Id. Finally, the court must consider whether there are\n“ready alternatives” to the regulation that “fully accommodate the\nprisoners’ rights at de minimus cost to valid penological interests.”\nId. at 90-91. The existence of such alternatives is evidence that the\nregulation is an “exaggerated response to prison concerns.” Id. at\n90 (quotations omitted).\n\n        Although the Supreme Court emphasized that the judiciary\nis often “ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems\nof prison administration and reform,” and should therefore give\nsignificant deference to prison officials in interpreting and\nimplementing regulations,6 the Court was not relinquishing the\npolicing of prison policy to prison administrators. Id. at 84\n(quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974)). To the\ncontrary, in Turner, while the Supreme Court upheld a rule barring\ninmate-to-inmate correspondence as reasonably related to\nlegitimate security interests, it also struck down an inmate marriage\nrestriction as an “exaggerated response to petitioners’ rehabilitation\nand security concerns.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 91. The Court held\n\n5\n Neither party contests that inmates have a First Amendment right\nto receive magazines and newspapers through the mail. See Allen\nv. Caughlin, 64 F.3d 77, 79 (2d Cir. 1995); Sizemore v. Williford,\n829 F.2d 608, 610 (7th Cir.1987).\n6\n As the District Court correctly pointed out, Fraise also asserted\nthat particular deference to prison authorities is especially\nappropriate when a regulation implicates prison security. 283 F.3d\nat 516.\n                                7\n\fthat the rule “sweeps much more broadly” than can be explained by\nthe stated objectives and therefore failed the reasonable\nrelationship test. Turner, 482 U.S. at 98.\n\n       As the Eleventh Circuit has aptly noted, “traditional\ndeference does not mean that courts have abdicated their duty to\nprotect those constitutional rights that a prisoner retains.” Fortner\nv. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, 1029 (11th Cir. 1993) (citations\nomitted). If Turner is to be a meaningful limit on the discretion of\nprison administrators, its four factors must be diligently weighed\nby reviewing courts.\n\n       B.     Factor One: Rational relationship to legitimate\n              penological interest\n\n       Banks argues that the connection between the policy and the\nvalid penological objectives cited as its justification is too\nattenuated to be rational.\n\n              1.      Rehabilitation\n\n        Unlike the government’s interest in security, the\nrehabilitation objective has never been defined by the Supreme\nCourt, and its contours remain “quite amorphous and ill-defined.”\nRamirez, 379 F.3d at 128 (citing Amatel v. Reno, 156 F.3d 192,\n209 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (Wald, J., dissenting)). Clearly, however,\nrestrictive prison policies can be designed to target particular\nbehaviors for which prisoners were incarcerated, or those that arose\nand presented security risks during incarceration.7 Id.\n\n      The District Court essentially determined that (1)\nwithholding privileges to get compliance is a sensible policy, and\n\n\n7\n In Waterman v. Farmer, for example, this Court upheld a prison\nregulation, justified as rehabilitative, which restricted sex\noffenders’ access to pornographic materials. 183 F.3d 208, 215\n(3d Cir. 1999). Prison authorities submitted affidavits from two\npsychologists who testified that pornographic materials threatened\nto thwart the effectiveness of the treatment given to sex offenders,\nand therefore that limiting access to such material was a sensible\nrehabilitation strategy.\n                                  8\n\f(2) denying all other privileges short of access to publications and\nphotographs had proven in the past not to be a sufficient incentive\nfor behavior modification because, if it had been, inmates would\nnot have been transferred to LTSU Level 2. Therefore, the District\nCourt found that denying publications and photographs was a\nrational next step.\n\n        Certainly, “deterrence of future infractions of prison rules”\nis a legitimate penological interest. See Gregory v. Auger, 768\nF.2d 287, 290 (8th Cir. 1985); Daigre v. M aggio, 719 F.2d 1310,\n1313 (5th Cir. 1983). In the Fifth and Eighth Circuits, temporary\nrestrictions on prisoners’ receipt of certain mail and subscription\npublications in disciplinary segregation have been upheld\nfollowing exactly the logic advanced by the DOC here. Those\ncourts held that such restrictions made disciplinary segregation less\nendurable and therefore discouraged inmates from the rule\ninfractions that would lead to such segregation. See also Guajardo\nv. Estelle, 568 F. Supp. 1354, 1366 (D.C. Tex. 1983) (permitting\ninmates in solitary confinement access to books, magazines and\nnewspapers may “water down the conditions in solitary and would\nmake the threat of solitary confinement meaningless”) (internal\nquotations omitted).\n\n        Although we agree that deterrence of future infractions of\nprison rules can be an appropriate justification for temporarily\nrestricting the rights of inmates, we cannot say that the DOC has\nshown how the regulations in this case serve such a purpose. We\nrecognize how such a rule could be reasonably related to a\npenological interest in rehabilitation in “disciplinary segregation”\nwhere inmates are placed for “specific rule infraction[s]” and for\nlimited and specific periods, but this is not such a case. Spellman\nv. Hopper, 95 F. Supp. 2d 1267, 1281 (M.D. Ala. 1999).\n\n        Although the DOC asserts that LTSU is a “disciplinary”\nstatus, the LTSU Level 2 is a unique kind of segregation with\ncharacteristics of both disciplinary and administrative segregation.\nInmates come to LTSU because of “unacceptable behaviors” in\nother institutions, but they have not all been adjudicated by a\nhearing officer to have violated the DOC’s rules. (App. 95) The\nLTSU is not a place where inmates are sent for a discrete period of\npunishment, pursuant to a specific infraction, but is a place for\n\n                                 9\n\f“Long Term” segregation of the most incorrigible and difficult\nprisoners for as long as they fall under that umbrella.\n\n       All LTSU inmates must spend 90 days at Level 2 status\nwhen they first arrive, and although their behavior will be reviewed\nevery 30 days to determine whether they deserve promotion to\nLevel 1, that determination is entirely within the discretion of\nprison administrators and is not linked to any particular infraction\nor compliance. While disciplinary segregation ordinarily has a\nspecified duration, inmates may remain in Level 2 and under the\npublication ban indefinitely. 8 In fact, several inmates have\nremained in Level 2 since the LTSU’s inception two years ago. As\nadministered, it is unclear how the policy would achieve the\ndeterrence it seeks. Not only is the rehabilitation justification\nillogical given the nature of LTSU confinement, but LTSU Level\n2 is a far cry from the disciplinary contexts in which such bans\nhave been deemed constitutional.\n\n       Furthermore, the DOC has offered no evidence that the rule\nachieves or could achieve its stated rehabilitative purpose. In\nWaterman, the DOC submitted affidavits from two psychologists\nwho testified that pornographic materials threatened to thwart the\neffectiveness of the treatment given to sex offenders and who\nagreed that limiting access to such material was a sensible\nrehabilitation strategy. 183 F.3d at 215. In Guajardo, the\ndefendants offered evidence as to the frequency and percentage of\n\n\n8\n In fact, disciplinary segregation is usually quite short in duration.\nIn Daigre, after addressing a guard profanely, Daigre was put in\n“administrative and punitive lockdown” for “a maximum of 10\ndays’ isolation” pursuant to a finding of “defiance.” 719 F.2d at\n1311. In Gregory, the challenged policy was in place for inmates\non Disciplinary Detention Status, which carried with it a 60-day\nmaximum duration. 768 F.2d at 290. In Guajardo, the court was\nevaluating a publication ban in place in solitary confinement, a\ntype of punitive segregation used as a sanction for violation of\nTexas Department of Corrections rules and regulations. An inmate\ncould be confined in solitary for a maximum of 15 days, and an\ninterval of at least three days was required between terms in\nsolitary, during which time the inmate could have access to any\npublications withheld during the term. 568 F. Supp. at 1366.\n                                  10\n\fsolitary confinements in the Texas Department of Corrections\n(“TDC”) which showed that the negative perception of solitary\nconfinement had a deterrent effect. 568 F. Supp. at 1368 (“a\nsignificant majority of TDC inmates have never experienced\nsolitary confinement and less than half of those who are confined\nin solitary return a second time”). Here, there are no such\nsupporting affidavits. The District Court presumably relied on\nSuperintendent Dickson’s testimony that the prohibition in\nquestion “gives us a means or method to say you comply, you\nmodify your behavior, and you can obtain these things, these\nprivileges,” and his explanation that “we’re very limited . . . in\nwhat we can and cannot deny or give to an inmate, and these are\nsome of the items that we feel are legitimate as incentives for\ninmate growth.” (App. 110) The District Court did not examine\nthe fit between the policy and its rehabilitative goals, whether the\nban was implemented in a way that could modify behavior, or\ninquire into whether the DOC’s deprivation theory of behavior\nmodification had any basis in real human psychology, or had\nproven effective with LTSU inmates. At oral argument, counsel\nfor the DOC said it was a “hope.” In fact, Banks argues that\ncontrary to the assertions of the prison authorities and the District\nCourt, isolating prisoners from the goings-on in the outside world\ntends to undercut any genuine rehabilitation. There is, again, no\nevidence in the record on this point, but Banks cites to language in\nseveral cases to support this assertion.9 It certainly seems relevant\n\n\n\n\n9\n Rehabilitative goals are “furthered by efforts to inform and\neducate inmates, and foster their involvement in the world outside\nthe prison gates.” Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1034\n(2d Cir. 1985). In Spellman v. Hopper, there was testimony\nthat deprivation of reading materials in segregation can cause\n“psychological deterioration” which in turn can cause inmates\neither to be “very withdrawn and curl up in infancy, or [to]\nbecome acting out and aggressive people.” 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1281;\nsee also Morrison v. Hall, 261 F.3d 896, 904 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(citing studies and articles noting the “correlation between reading,\nwriting and inmate rehabilitation”).\n                                  11\n\fto the above inquiry, as well as likely, that the ban may produce\nless rather than more compliance in at least some inmates.10\n\n              2.      Security\n\n       With respect to security, the District Court held that there\nwas a valid rational connection between the ban on periodicals and\nphotographs in LTSU Level 2 and the constellation of security\nconcerns put forth by the DOC. We cannot conclude from the\nrecord that such a connection exists. This is so for two reasons.\n\n        First, there is no evidence in the record of the misuse of\nperiodicals or photographs in any of the ways described by the\nDOC. In fact, matches are not allowed in the LTSU. See also\nGregory, 768 F.2d at 289 (“cellblock fires have been eliminated\nentirely . . . by new regulations prohibiting inmates from\npossessing matches”). There was no testimony as to the frequency\nof fires in the LTSU, nor testimony about any particular fires, in or\nout of LTSU segregation, and how and with what materials they\n\n\n\n\n10\n  Our dissenting colleague contends that we misapply the first\nTurner factor by requiring the DOC to show some evidence to\nsupport its contention that the rule achieves or could achieve its\nstated rehabilitative purpose. However, our insistence that the\nDOC offer some evidence is not, in our view, at odds with Turner\nbut rather a complementary part of the analysis in determining\nwhether an asserted goal is logically connected to the prison\nregulation. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89 (requiring prison authorities\nto put forward a legitimate governmental interest justifying the\nregulation). Indeed, in Turner, the Supreme Court evaluated the\nevidence in determining whether the prison rules in question served\n- in theory or in practice - the alleged penological goals. See id. at\n91-93, 98-99. In our view, the paucity of any such evidence in this\nmatter reinforces the conclusion that there is no valid, rational\nconnection between the DOC rule and its stated rehabilitative\npurpose.\n                                    12\n\fwere set and fueled.11 The same is true for the materials’ potential\nuse as weapons.\n\n       Furthermore, there was no testimony as to the effect such a\nban has had on the frequency of fires, be it in the LTSU or\nelsewhere. In fact, Banks points out that inmates on Death Row,\nin Administrative Custody, and in the Special Management Unit\nare routinely permitted to have these items, and the DOC presented\nno evidence that the security or operations of these units are\nnegatively affected to any palpable degree by the presence of these\nitems.\n\n        The District Court dismissed this argument, agreeing with\nthe DOC that a comparison to other forms of segregation within the\nPennsylvania DOC is irrelevant because LTSU inmates are the\n“worst of the worst.” However, there is no evidence before us to\nindicate that what sets these inmates apart from the rest is their\nmisuse of non-legal or non-religious periodicals. The District\nCourt’s conclusion that “the fact that other segregated inmates have\nnot created the same security concerns while in possession of\nnewspapers and magazines is one reason they are in those units and\nnot in the LTSU” is an inference that finds no support in the record.\nIn fact, there is no indication in the record that any LTSU inmates\nwere transferred there because they had created a security risk with\nperiodicals or photographs. The LTSU inmates are certainly and\nunquestionably incorrigible, but whether their incorrigibility takes\nthe form described by the District Court is an open question which\ncannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage by making\ninferences in favor of the DOC and without support in the record.\n\n       Second, we agree with Banks that given the materials Level\n2 inmates are permitted in their cells, prohibiting a single\nnewspaper or magazine has no significant relationship to the stated\nsecurity objectives. There are many other non-prohibited means\n\n\n11\n  Superintendent Dickson testified only that within the last six\nmonths there were “no more than two or three” cell fires in the\nentirety of the LTSU, and “paper products generally are the way\nit’s first ignited.” He also testified that he did not know of any\ninstance where a LTSU Level 1 inmate used a newspaper or\nmagazine to start or fuel a fire. (App. 112)\n                                  13\n\ffor the inmates to fuel fires, hurl waste, conceal contraband and\ncreate weapons. Under current regulations, each inmate is given a\njumpsuit, a blanket, two bedsheets, a pillow case, a roll of toilet\npaper, a copy of a prison handbook, ten sheets of writing paper,\nseveral envelopes, carbon paper, three pairs of socks, three\nundershorts and three undershirts, and may at any point also have\nreligious newspapers, legal periodicals, a prison library book,\nBibles, and a lunch tray with a plate and a cup. Many of these\nitems are flammable, could be used for the above purposes as\neffectively as a newspaper, magazine or photograph, and have been\nso used by LTSU Level 2 inmates.12 The District Court again\nagreed with the DOC that the prohibition may not eliminate but\ncertainly reduces the security risks with which the DOC is\nconcerned, and that it is irrelevant that the policy does not\nabsolutely prevent the harms it addresses because Turner is not a\n“least-restrictive-alternative” test. Fraise, 283 F.3d at 520;\nWaterman, 183 F.3d at 219.\n\n       Although the District Court is correct that the policy need\nnot be narrowly tailored to the harm it addresses to pass\nconstitutional muster, its conclusion here has some flaws. Even if\nthe policy need not be “narrowly tailored” to the stated interests, if\nthe prohibition of newspapers, magazines and photographs has\nonly a minimal effect on security in the LTSU because of the other\nmaterials that they are permitted in the cells, the relationship\nbetween the policy and the penological interest may be too\nattenuated to be reasonable.13 It is important to note here that the\n\n12\n  In his deposition, Superintendent Dickson testified not only that\nunder the challenged policy there have still been cell fires and\nrashes of feces-flinging in LTSU level 2, but also that inmates can\nand do use other permitted materials to create these disturbances:\n“Oftentimes it’s with the cups that they’re given for their drinks,\nthings like that . . . a piece of paper or whatever . . . that they can\nuse to give a little leverage and fling the materials.” (App. 112)\n13\n  See Spellman, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1278; Jackson v. Elrod, 671 F.\nSupp. 1508, 1511 (N.D. Ill. 1987) aff’d, 881 F.2d 441 (7th Cir.\n1989) (admission that hardcover books are no greater a risk to\nconceal contraband than, for example, clothing, paperbacks,\nmattresses and light fixtures, “disproves defendant’s assertion of a\nrational connection between their hardcover book ban and a\n                                 14\n\finmates are not requesting unlimited access to innumerable\nperiodicals but for the ability to have one newspaper or magazine\nand some small number of photographs in their cells at one time.\nWe fail to see how the DOC could have reasonably thought that the\nchallenged policy, which permits an inmate to have in his cell 10\nsheets of writing paper and one records center box full of legal or\nreligious periodicals or texts, would meaningfully improve prison\nsecurity by forbidding him one copy of the Graterfriends prison\nnewsletter.14\n\n       The District Court asserted that the prohibited materials are\n“more likely” to be used to create a security concern and are “most\neasily and commonly used as weapons or to set fires and fling\nfeces” than religious or legal materials, and therefore the link\nbetween the policy and the stated interest is more than tenuous.\n(App. 125) However, nowhere in Dickson’s affidavit does he\ndescribe specific incidents where the prohibited materials were\nused in any manner posing a security risk by LTSU inmates before\nor after they were transferred to LTSU.

Rusk, 670 F.2d 737, 744 (7th Cir.\n1982) (total ban on newspapers unjustifiable when hazards of\nnewspaper possession could as well be caused by reading material\ndetainees were permitted to have); Payne v.

Cal. 1971) (“Jail cells are already filled\nwith an abundance of materials quite suitable for fire starting . . .;\nyet no one suggests that cells ought to be stripped of bedding,\nclothing, toilet paper, writing materials, and so on.”).\n14\n  In a memo dated February 8, 2001, and distributed to LTSU\ninmates, Superintendent Dickson stated that the publication\nGraterfriends is a newsletter, not legal mail, and therefore denied\nto Level 2 inmates. Graterfriends is a Pennsylvania-based\nnewsletter published under the auspices of The Pennsylvania\nPrison Society to which prisoners contribute and which is\ndistributed to prisoners and other members of the corrections\ncommunity.\n                                15\n\fand have been used to fuel fires, hide contraband, fling feces and\ncreate weapons. (App. 112)\n\n       C.     Factor two: Means for exercising the burdened right\n\n       Under this factor, we are asked to “focus on the burden that\nthe regulation imposes on an inmate’s ability to engage in\nconstitutionally protected activity.” DeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47,\n53 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc). If other avenues are open for the\ninmate to exercise the right in question, the court should exhibit\ndeference to the judgment of corrections officials, while if no other\navenues are available, the inmate’s right is given greater weight in\nthe Turner balancing process. Id.15\n\n       Banks argues that while Level 2 inmates can read leisure\nbooks, they have no meaningful access to current news accounts or\npublished information about current political, social, or other\npublic events and activities occurring outside the prison walls, and\nthey have no way to look at images of loved ones and friends apart\nfrom the possibility of infrequent visits. The District Court,\nhowever, disagreeing with Banks, found that inmates had sufficient\nmeans to engage in the constitutionally-protected activities.\n\n        The District Court characterized the periodicals ban as “not\na blanket prohibition” because Level 2 inmates can qualify by good\nconduct to be promoted to LTSU Level 1. The District Court’s\njustification for this determination is its explanation that “each of\nthese prisoners has the option of modifying his behavior and being\npromoted to a less restricted environment where access to\nnewspapers magazines and photographs may be enjoyed.” (App.\n126) As the DOC elaborated in its brief, “there is no reason to\nsuppose that a prison administration would not respond favorably\nto a prisoner’s initiative to qualify for relief from the ban on\nperiodicals or photos through exhibiting good behavior.”\n\n\n\n\n15\n Although this inquiry depends in part on how the scope of the\nconstitutional right is defined, neither the parties nor the District\nCourt define the right in question, nor does the District Court’s\nanalysis depend on a particular understanding of the rights in\nquestion.\n                                 16\n\f       The District Court and the DOC are correct in noting that\ninmates can be promoted from Level 2 to Level 1 and, if they are,\nthey will gain access to the prohibited materials. However, that\ndoes not change the fact that the prohibition is indeed a “blanket”\none, and that as long as an inmate is at Level 2 status and is subject\nto the policy in question, he has no alternative means to exercise\nhis First Amendment right of access to a reasonable amount of\nnewspapers, magazines, and photographs.\n\n       Moreover, there is no reason to infer that the process of\n“promotion” from Level 2 to Level 1 is as much under the inmates’\ncontrol as the DOC and the District Court characterize it. As noted\nabove, segregation in Level 2 is not linked to a particular\ninfraction, and is of potentially unlimited duration. Any inmate\nwho enters LTSU will remain at Level 2 for 90 days no matter how\nhe modifies his behavior. Furthermore, the only information in the\nrecord as to how the process works is the following explanation\nfrom Dickson’s deposition:\n\n              You know, you have the ability through your own\n              actions to be promoted, if you will, from a level 2\n              inmate to a level 1 inmate, and we do that every day.\n              We have a system where the unit management team\n              reviews each inmate’s progress every thirty days.\n              The unit management team is made up of the unit\n              manager, custody staff, psych staff, nursing staff.\n              And we try to give and provide every inmate every\n              opportunity to progress through this system and to be\n              able to obtain these privileges. (App. 110)\n\n        There are no affidavits in the record from any of those\ndecision-makers mentioned by Dickson, nor is there any\ndocumentation of the review process. Although at Dickson’s\ndeposition, Banks’ attorney apparently examined and requested\nsome documents which indicated, with respect to current LTSU\ninmates, how long they had been at the facility and how long they\nhad been at Level 2, those documents are also not in the record.\nAgain, unlike the policies in solitary and disciplinary confinement\nexamined in Daigre, Gregory, and Guajarde, the LTSU prohibition\ncannot be characterized as merely a “time, place or manner”\nrestriction. See, e.g., Gregory, 768 F.2d at 290 (“[the policy is] not\n\n                                 17\n\fdirected at what mail an inmate could receive, but only at when he\ncould receive it”).\n\n       D.     Factors Three and Four : Accommodation\n\n        We now consider the District Court’s analysis of Turner’s\nthird and fourth factors. Under these factors, we must determine\nwhether the right in question can be accommodated without\nsignificant negative consequences in terms of efficiency and\nsecurity, DeHart, 227 F.3d at 58, and “whether the prison can\neasily serve its interests with alternative means without infringing\nupon the rights of prisoners,” Crofton v. Roe, 170 F.3d 957, 959\n(9th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court has suggested that the\n“existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence that the\nregulation is not reasonable, but is an exaggerated response to\nprison concerns.” Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 418 (1989)\n(citation and quotations omitted).\n\n       In Fraise, inmates challenged a policy which authorized\nprison authorities to designate and transfer core members of\n“Security Threat Groups” as violative of the First Amendment’s\nFree Exercise Clause, as well as the Equal Protection and Due\nProcess Clauses.16 The Court determined that the third prong\nweighed in favor of the DOC and, quoting Turner, stated that\n“[w]hen accommodation of an asserted right will have a significant\n‘ripple effect’ on fellow inmates or on prison staff, courts should\nbe particularly deferential to the informed discretion of corrections\nofficials.” Fraise, 283 F.3d at 520 (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at\n90). It is certainly supported by the record, as the District Court\nrepeatedly asserted, that the LTSU Level 2 inmates are some of the\nmost “intractable” in the Pennsylvania prison system. We cannot\nagree, however, on the record before us, that accommodation of\nthose prisoners’ rights by giving them reasonable access to a\nlimited number of periodicals and photographs would have such a\n“ripple effect.”\n\n16\n  A Security Threat Group (“STG”) is a group of inmates,\ndesignated by the Commissioner, which “poses a threat to the\nsafety of staff, other inmates, the community, and/or damages to,\nor destruction of property, and/or interrupting the safe secure and\norderly operation of the correctional facility(ies).” Fraise, 283 F.3d\nat 509.\n                                  18\n\f        At no point does Banks propose that Level 2 inmates be\nallowed unmitigated and unregulated access to all periodicals.\nRather, Banks proposes, and the District Court discussed, two\nalternative policies which would accommodate the prisoners’\nrights. First, the DOC could establish a specific reading period, or\nseveral different reading periods, in which guards deliver a single\nnewspaper or magazine to an inmate’s cell, if requested, and\nretrieve it at the close of the period. The DOC could easily control\nthe number of periodicals in his cell at one time, the frequency of\nthe distributions, the amount of time any inmate would be in\npossession of the materials, as well as the number of inmates who\nwould have periodicals in their cells at any one time.17 The DOC\ncould also limit the total number of photographs a Level 2 inmate\ncould have in his cell at one time to what they consider a\nreasonable number. In conjunction with this policy, access to\nperiodicals could be entirely withheld from those individual\nprisoners who, in the judgment of prison officials, would pose a\nparticular risk given their records, or those inmates who have\nabused their use of periodicals or photographs. The DOC asserts\nthat such a limited restriction would not prevent Level 2 inmates\nfrom using the materials to start fires, fling feces and create\nweapons and therefore, during the reading period, extra monitoring\nof cells would be required, thus affecting the prison’s resources and\npossibly the safety of other inmates.\n\n       We fail to see, however, as discussed above under factor\none, how an inmate’s hour-long possession of Graterfriends would\nrequire further monitoring when at any time that inmate may be in\npossession of 10 sheets of writing paper, and as many copies of the\nWatchtower, the Jewish Daily Forward, and the Christian Science\nMonitor Magazine as can fit in a records center box. As discussed\nabove, the District Court’s assumption that prisoners would be\nmore reluctant to use religious materials for such nefarious\npurposes is unsupported by the record. Furthermore, at any point,\nthe entire LTSU can house no more than 40 inmates, one-tenth of\none percent of the state’s prison population. (App. 95) Even if\nlimited distribution of periodicals were to require additional\n\n17\n Volume control is a well-recognized alternative to the blanket\nexclusion of items protected by the First Amendment. See\nClement v. California Dept. of Corrections, 220 F. Supp. 2d 1098,\n1113 (N.D. Cal. 2002); Spellman, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1286.\n                               19\n\fmonitoring, such an accommodation would have a minimal impact\non prison resources.\n\n        Alternatively, individual prisoners could be escorted to the\nsecure mini-law library to read a periodical of their choosing.\nAgain, the District Court found that such an accommodation would\nintensify security concerns by increasing the amount of inmate\nmovement and thereby placing a formidable burden on LTSU\nstaff.18 Inmates are already permitted to leave their cells under\nguard escort to use the library to view legal materials, so individual\ninmate escort has not been deemed prohibitively burdensome or\ndangerous by prison administrators. Although it is possible that the\ndemand for mini-law library sessions may increase if the policy\nwere changed, the DOC has not shown how this would\nsignificantly increase the burden on prison staff. Superintendent\nDickson explained in his deposition that under current LTSU\npolicy, one inmate is allowed out of his cell at a time to visit the\nlaw library for one two-hour session. A roster of requests, like a\nwaiting-list, is maintained and fulfilled on a first-come first-serve\nbasis. The amount or frequency of inmate movement is already\nregulated. If the inmates’ rights to read other periodicals were\naccommodated, that would not change. We fail to see how the\nmere addition of non-legal and non-religious periodicals to the\nmaterials already available to the inmates in the library would\ncreate the “ripple effect” cited by the DOC. In short, the DOC has\nnot shown that a change in the publication ban would mean\n“significantly less liberty and safety for everyone else, guards and\n\n18\n  Here, the District Court relies on Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 208 F.\nSupp. 2d 520, 530 (E.D. Pa. 2002), in which the court found that\nthe third Turner factor weighed in the prison authorities’ favor\nbecause the inmate was particularly ill-behaved and\naccommodating his presence at religious services would require\nmore monitoring of those services, thereby straining prison\nresources and affecting the prison staff and other inmates.\nAlthough the Turner factors are evaluated independently, it is\nimportant to note with respect to this decision that the prison policy\nwas much narrower and the court’s analysis was informed by the\nfact that the inmate had many meaningful ways to practice his\nreligion without attending services. He could meditate, pray and\nstudy his religion, as well as discuss it with other inmates outside\nhis cell. Id.\n                                  20\n\fother prisoners alike.” Abbott, 490 U.S. at 418 (quoting Turner,\n482 U.S. at 92).\n\n        Finally, the District Court asserted that the alternatives\nproposed come at more than a de minimus cost to the DOC’s\nbehavior modification goals because the accessibility of periodicals\nwould render the threat of Level 2 segregation toothless as a\ndeterrent. However, the District Court overlooked the extent to\nwhich, even without the challenged restriction, Level 2 LTSU\nsegregation is more restrictive than Level 1 in significant respects.\nFor example, Level 1 inmates are permitted two family visits and\none fifteen minute telephone call per month. They are also\npermitted to spend $5.00 per week at the commissary on items\ndefined by the Unit Team. Additionally, while inmates at both\nlevels receive in-cell counseling and visits from chaplains, and can\nbe employed as Unit Janitor, only Level 1 inmates receive\ncompensation as per DC-816 Inmate Compensation System, and\nonly Level 1 inmates are permitted GED and Special Education in-\ncell study. (App. 32)\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we believe that the DOC’s\npolicy that prohibits inmates confined in the LTSU at Level 2\nstatus access to photographs, and all newspapers and magazines\nwhich are neither legal nor religious in nature, cannot be supported\nas a matter of law by the record in this case. Accordingly, the\nsummary judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the\ncase remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nALITO, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n        At issue in this case are restrictions that the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections imposes as a last resort on the most\ndisruptive and dangerous .1% of its prison population. These\nrestrictions apply only as long as an inmate remains in Level 2 of\nthe LTSU, an assignment that may terminate after as little as 90\ndays. The question before us is whether these temporary, last-\nresort restrictions are facially unconstitutional under the standard\nset out in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), a standard that\ninstructs courts to extend considerable deference to judgments of\n\n                                 21\n\fcorrectional officials. Because I believe that the majority has\nmisapplied Turner, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n       Under Turner, prison regulations that restrict constitutional\nrights must be sustained if they are “reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.” 482 U.S. at 89. Turner noted four\nfactors to be considered in determining whether the requisite\nreasonable relationship exists: (1) whether there is “a ‘valid,\nrational connection’ between the prison regulation and the\nlegitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it”; (2)\n“whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that\nremain open to prison inmates”; (3) “the impact accommodation of\nthe asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other\ninmates”; and (4) whether there are “ready alternatives” to the\nchallenged regulation.” Id. at 89-90 (citation omitted). I will\naddress each factor.\n\n        First factor: Rational relationship between regulation\nand legitimate penological interests. I agree with the District\nCourt that this factor weighs in favor of the constitutionality of the\nchallenged regulations because there is a “rational” relationship\nbetween that restriction and the legitimate penological objective of\ndeterring misconduct. It is “rational” for corrections officials to\nthink that inmates who are not in Level 2 will be deterred from\nengaging in serious misconduct because they do not want to be\ntransferred to that unit and thus to be subjected to the restrictions\nthat accompany that assignment. It is also “rational” for\ncorrections officials to think that inmates who are in Level 2 will\nbe deterred from engaging in serious misconduct while in that unit\nbecause they wish to be transferred out and thus to escape such\nrestrictions.\n\n       The majority disagrees with these conclusions for two\nreasons. First, the majority apparently believes that a sanction\ncannot deter unless a potential violator knows with some\nspecificity the type misconduct that will result in the imposition of\nthe sanction and the length of time that the sanction will last. The\nmajority concedes that “deterrence of future infractions of prison\nrules can be an appropriate justification for temporarily restricting\nthe rights of inmates” and that other courts of appeals have\nsustained rules restricting the receipt of newspapers by prisoners in\ndisciplinary segregation. See Maj. at 9 (citing Gregory v. Auger,\n                                 22\n\f768 F.2d 287, 290 (8 th Cir. 1985); Daigre v. M aggio, 719 F.2d\n1310, 1313 (5 th Cir. 1983)). The majority finds these precedents\ninapplicable because the “LTSU is not a place where inmates are\nsent for a discrete period of punishment, pursuant to a specific\ninfraction, but a place for ‘Long Term’ segregation of the most\nincorrigible and difficult prisoners for as long as they fall under\nthat umbrella.” Id.\n\n        The majority’s reasoning is unsound. The uncertainties\nnoted by the majority may diminish the deterrent effect of the\nregulations on some inmates who are not yet in Level 2, but there\nis no reason to think that these uncertainties entirely eliminate the\ndeterrent effect of the regulations on the general prison population.\nSimilarly, it is rational to believe that the challenged restrictions\nprovide an incentive for those inmates who are already in Level 2\nto refrain from disruptive behavior in the hope of obtaining a\ntransfer out of the unit. Again, uncertainty about what must be\ndone to obtain such a transfer or about when such a transfer may be\navailable may have an impact on the degree of the incentive, but\nthere is no reason to suppose that the incentive is wholly destroyed.\n\n        Second, the majority concludes that the regulations are not\nrationally related to the goal of deterring misconduct because “the\nDOC has offered no evidence that the rule achieves or could\nachieve its stated rehabilitative purpose.” Maj. Op. at 10. In taking\nthis approach, the majority misconstrues the nature of the first\nTurner factor. This factor requires us to determine whether there\nis a “logical connection between the regulation and the asserted\ngoal,” see 482 U.S. at 89 (emphasis added), not whether there is\nempirical evidence that the regulation in fact serves that goal. The\nentire system of prison discipline might be imperilled if each\nsanction for prison misconduct could not be sustained without\nempirical evidence that the sanction provided some incremental\ndeterrent.\n\n        Second factor: alternative means of exercising the right.\nThis is the most troubling of the four factors, but I do not think that\nit is sufficient to support the majority’s conclusion that the\nregulations are facially unconstitutional. The regulations impinge\nupon the right to receive information about current events and\ncommunications (in the form of photographs) from family\nmembers and friends, but the restrictions are not absolute. Inmates\n                                  23\n\fin Level 2 may still read books from the prison library and may\nreceive letters. Moreover, as the District Court noted, inmates in\nLevel 2 have the “option of modifying their behavior and being\npromoted to a less restricted environment.”            Report &\nRecommendation at 8. An as-applied challenge by an inmate\nsubjected to lengthy confinement in Level 2 despite a record of\nreformed behavior would present different considerations, but the\nmajority’s opinion is not limited to such a case.\n\n       Third and fourth factors: Availability and impact of\naccommodation. The majority proposes modifications in prison\npolicies that would almost certainly have an impact on prison\nresources. The majority first suggests that guards could deliver\nrequested newspapers and magazines to inmates’ cells and then\nretrieve these materials after the expiration of a specified “reading\nperiod.” Maj. Op. at 18. Providing this service for each of the 40\ninmates in Level 2 would be time consuming. “Alternatively,” the\nmajority states, “individual prisoners could be escorted to [the]\nsecure mini-law library to read a periodical of their choosing.”\nMaj. Op. at 19. This service, however, would undoubtedly impose\na significant burden, particularly since the inmates in question are\nthose whom the Department of Corrections has classified as the\nmost violent and disruptive. It is Department policy that Level 2\ninmates may not be transported from their cells unless they are\nplaced in hand and leg irons and are escorted by two officers.\n\n       Taking into account all four of the Turner factors, I\nconclude that the challenged regulations are not facially\nunconstitutional. On their face, these regulations are reasonably\nrelated to the legitimate penological goal of curbing prison\nmisconduct, and I would therefore affirm the decision of the\nDistrict Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\f",

We disagree and therefore will reverse.\n\n            I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n        The LTSU was established at SCI Pittsburgh in April 2000\nas a place to confine a small population of inmates1 which the DOC\nviews, because of their history of behavior in prison, as too\ndisruptive, violent or problematic to house elsewhere.2 Inmates are\nclassified at “Level 2” when admitted to the Unit, must remain\nthere a minimum of 90 days, and may remain at Level 2\nindefinitely. The length of time a prisoner may spend in the LTSU\nis open-ended and subject to the discretion of prison personnel.\n\n       Department policy prohibits Level 2 prisoners from\nreceiving newspapers or magazines directly from the publisher,\nfrom the prison library, or from any other source for the duration\nof their confinement at Level 2 status unless the publication is\nreligious or legal in nature. Individual articles clipped from\npublications are prohibited, unless they relate to the inmate or his\nfamily. Also prohibited is the possession or receipt of photographs\nof spouses, other family members, or friends.\n\n1\n The maximum population in the LTSU is 40. (App. 92)\nDeposition testimony in this case discloses that, during the relevant\nperiod, the LTSU population was comprised of 36 Level 2 and\nthree Level 1 inmates. (App. 93)\n2\n The relevant DOC regulations state: “Any inmate who is, has or\nmay be planning to engage in the following activities may be\nappropriate for assignment in the LTSU: (1) inmates who fail to\ncomplete SMU [Special Management Unit]; (2) serious escape\nhistory; (3) assaultive behavior with the intent to cause death or\nserious bodily injury; (4) injury to staff and/or inmates; (5)\nengaging in facility disturbance(s); (6) recorded history of exerting\nnegative influence in facility activities; (7) Security Threat Group\n(STG) member or other unauthorized organization(s); (8)\nPerpetuated criminal activity that threatens the community; (9) a\nhistory of being a sexual predator; and/or (10) possessing weapons\nand/or implements of escape.” 6.5.1 Administration of Security\nLevel 5 Housing Units Procedure Manual at 1-16.\n                                  3\n\f       Other DOC rules which govern life at LTSU Level 2\nprohibit inmates from having radios or televisions, permit phone\ncalls only in emergencies or when related to inmates’ legal\nrepresentation, limit inmates to one visit with an immediate family\nmember per month, and require inmates to remain in their cells 23\nhours a day, one inmate to a cell. Inmates are permitted, however,\nreligious or legal publications and paperback books that can be\nordered from the prison library. To review legal materials, one\nLTSU inmate at a time may be let out of his cell and is escorted\nfrom it to a “mini law library” in hand and leg irons by two\ncorrections officers. (App. 11)\n\n        The policy challenged here is unique in the state prison\nsystem, even among other segregated inmates. Level 1 LTSU\ninmates are permitted one subscription newspaper in their cells\nwhich can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis and are also\npermitted five subscription magazines at any given time.3\nDepartment policy also authorizes Special Management Unit\n(“SMU”) inmates (another class of segregated inmates identified\nas being among the most difficult inmates in the system) to have\nvarious numbers of subscription newspapers, magazines and\nphotographs in their cells, depending on their classification level.\n(App. 77) Similarly, dangerous inmates who are segregated in the\nDepartment’s regular Restrictive Housing Unit on Administrative\nCustody status for security reasons are permitted one subscription\nnewspaper in their cells which can be exchanged on a one-for-one\nbasis, as well as subscription magazines and up to 10 photographs.\n\n       Deputy Superintendent Joel Dickson, who supervises the\nLTSU, testified in his deposition that the prohibition serves several\npenological purposes, which were reiterated by the defendant in its\nbriefs. First, and emphasized by Dickson as most important, is\nbehavior modification and rehabilitation. Dickson explained that\nin Level 2, inmates are deprived of certain privileges to create an\nincentive to comply with prison rules and thereby be removed to\nLevel 1 and eventually to the general population. Among Level 1\ninmates, the prospect of having the privileges denied discourages\nbacksliding. Also, Dickson explained that as inmates improve their\n\n\n3\n    The photograph prohibition, however, remains unchanged.\n                                  4\n\fbehavior to earn privileges, they become better integrated members\nof prison society or, if released, better members of free society and\n“more productive citizen[s].” (App. 111) Second, the less material\nLevel 2 prisoners have in their cells, the easier it is for correctional\noffices to detect concealed contraband and provide security. Third,\nnewspapers and magazines can be rolled up and used as blow guns\nor spears, can fuel cell fires, or can be used as crude tools to\ncatapult feces at the guards.\n\n        Plaintiff Ronald Banks filed the Complaint in this action on\nOctober 18, 2001. Seeking equitable and declaratory relief, the\nComplaint challenged the constitutionality of the DOC policy that\ndenies Level 2 inmates access to newspapers, magazines and\nphotographs of family members and friends. The inmates argued\nthat, under Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), the policy offends\ntheir right to free speech either because it bears no rational\nconnection to any legitimate penological interest or because it is an\nexaggerated response to such an interest. A motion for class\ncertification was filed and granted on March 22, 2002. After\ndiscovery was completed, the parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment in September of 2002.\n\n       On November 15, 2002, Magistrate Judge Robert Mitchell\nrecommended granting summary judgment to the DOC. The\nrecommendation reasoned that the Turner factors weighed in the\nDOC’s favor and that the policy was rationally related to, and\nfurthered the legitimate penological interests of, institutional\nsecurity and prisoner rehabilitation. Despite Banks’ objections, on\nJanuary 10, 2003 the magistrate’s recommendation and reasoning\nwere adopted by order of the District Court.\n\n       The District Court reasoned first that the policy is not an\nimpermissible First Amendment violation because it is rationally\nrelated to the legitimate and interrelated penological interests in\nrehabilitation and security. It encourages compliance with prison\nrules and deprives especially incorrigible prisoners of material\nfrom which they can fashion crude weapons or feed cell fires.\n\n      Second, the District Court held that the policy is not an\nexaggerated response to the stated penological concerns. The court\nagreed with the DOC that inmates can meaningfully exercise the\nburdened First Amendment rights by qualifying with good\n                                   5\n\fbehavior for promotion to Level 1 or by corresponding with family\nand friends. Furthermore, given the particular intractability of\nLevel 2 inmates, any further accommodation of their rights would\nimpose costs that cannot be characterized as only de minimus. 4\nBanks timely appealed the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment.\n\n            II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The District Court had original jurisdiction over the action\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1343 because the claim asserts a violation\nof the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This Court has\nappellate jurisdiction over the order of the District Court granting\nsummary judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de\nnovo the District Court’s decision to grant the DOC’s motion for\nsummary judgment. See Sutton v. Rasheed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781286\"><a href=\"/opinion/781286/richard-x-sutton-robert-x-wise-michael-x-walker-v-imam-adeeb-rasheed/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (3d\nCir. 2003). In reviewing the record, we view the evidence and any\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty, and resolve all factual conflicts in its favor.

Discussion\n\n       A.     The Turner Standard\n\n        We have repeatedly echoed the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition that “prison walls do not form a barrier separating\nprison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.” Ramirez\nv. Pugh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787308\"><a href=\"/opinion/787308/marc-ramirez-v-michael-v-pugh-warden-lsci-allenwood-janet-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126 (3d Cir. 2004); Fraise v.

In\nTurner, the Supreme Court acknowledged, however, that inmates’\nconstitutional rights may in some cases be limited, and held that a\nprison regulation that impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights “is\n\n\n\n\n4\n Here, the DOC asserts the existence of the “ripple effect,” cited in\nTurner, as a magnifier of cost in the prison environment. 482 U.S.\nat 90.\n                                  6\n\fvalid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”\n482 U.S. at 89.5\n\n        The Supreme Court articulated an analytical framework\nwithin which the reasonableness of such a regulation is assessed by\nweighing four factors. First, there must be a “valid, rational\nconnection between the prison regulation and the legitimate\ngovernmental interest put forward to justify it.” Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 89 (quotations omitted). Second, the court must determine\n“whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that\nremain open to prison inmates.” Id. at 90. Third, the court must\nassess “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates” and prison resources\ngenerally. Id. Finally, the court must consider whether there are\n“ready alternatives” to the regulation that “fully accommodate the\nprisoners’ rights at de minimus cost to valid penological interests.”\nId. at 90-91. The existence of such alternatives is evidence that the\nregulation is an “exaggerated response to prison concerns.” Id. at\n90 (quotations omitted).\n\n        Although the Supreme Court emphasized that the judiciary\nis often “ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems\nof prison administration and reform,” and should therefore give\nsignificant deference to prison officials in interpreting and\nimplementing regulations,6 the Court was not relinquishing the\npolicing of prison policy to prison administrators. Id. at 84\n(quoting Procunier v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109016\"><a href=\"/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1974)). To the\ncontrary, in Turner, while the Supreme Court upheld a rule barring\ninmate-to-inmate correspondence as reasonably related to\nlegitimate security interests, it also struck down an inmate marriage\nrestriction as an “exaggerated response to petitioners’ rehabilitation\nand security concerns.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 91. The Court held\n\n5\n Neither party contests that inmates have a First Amendment right\nto receive magazines and newspapers through the mail. See Allen\nv.

Turner, 482 U.S. at 98.\n\n       As the Eleventh Circuit has aptly noted, “traditional\ndeference does not mean that courts have abdicated their duty to\nprotect those constitutional rights that a prisoner retains.” Fortner\nv.

If Turner is to be a meaningful limit on the discretion of\nprison administrators, its four factors must be diligently weighed\nby reviewing courts.\n\n       B.     Factor One: Rational relationship to legitimate\n              penological interest\n\n       Banks argues that the connection between the policy and the\nvalid penological objectives cited as its justification is too\nattenuated to be rational.\n\n              1.      Rehabilitation\n\n        Unlike the government’s interest in security, the\nrehabilitation objective has never been defined by the Supreme\nCourt, and its contours remain “quite amorphous and ill-defined.”\nRamirez, 379 F.3d at 128 (citing Amatel v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758013\"><a href=\"/opinion/758013/joseph-amatel-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n209 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (Wald, J., dissenting)). Clearly, however,\nrestrictive prison policies can be designed to target particular\nbehaviors for which prisoners were incarcerated, or those that arose\nand presented security risks during incarceration.7 Id.\n\n      The District Court essentially determined that (1)\nwithholding privileges to get compliance is a sensible policy, and\n\n\n7\n In Waterman v. Farmer, for example, this Court upheld a prison\nregulation, justified as rehabilitative, which restricted sex\noffenders’ access to pornographic materials. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765101\"><a href=\"/opinion/765101/richard-waterman-michael-curtis-v-john-farmer-jr-new-jersey-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215\n(3d Cir. 1999). Prison authorities submitted affidavits from two\npsychologists who testified that pornographic materials threatened\nto thwart the effectiveness of the treatment given to sex offenders,\nand therefore that limiting access to such material was a sensible\nrehabilitation strategy.\n                                  8\n\f(2) denying all other privileges short of access to publications and\nphotographs had proven in the past not to be a sufficient incentive\nfor behavior modification because, if it had been, inmates would\nnot have been transferred to LTSU Level 2. Therefore, the District\nCourt found that denying publications and photographs was a\nrational next step.\n\n        Certainly, “deterrence of future infractions of prison rules”\nis a legitimate penological interest. See Gregory v. Auger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455908\"><a href=\"/opinion/455908/leonard-gregory-jr-v-warden-calvin-auger-assistant-warden-sissel-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290 (8th Cir. 1985); Daigre v.

In the Fifth and Eighth Circuits, temporary\nrestrictions on prisoners’ receipt of certain mail and subscription\npublications in disciplinary segregation have been upheld\nfollowing exactly the logic advanced by the DOC here. Those\ncourts held that such restrictions made disciplinary segregation less\nendurable and therefore discouraged inmates from the rule\ninfractions that would lead to such segregation.

We\nrecognize how such a rule could be reasonably related to a\npenological interest in rehabilitation in “disciplinary segregation”\nwhere inmates are placed for “specific rule infraction[s]” and for\nlimited and specific periods, but this is not such a case.

(App. 95) The\nLTSU is not a place where inmates are sent for a discrete period of\npunishment, pursuant to a specific infraction, but is a place for\n\n                                 9\n\f“Long Term” segregation of the most incorrigible and difficult\nprisoners for as long as they fall under that umbrella.\n\n       All LTSU inmates must spend 90 days at Level 2 status\nwhen they first arrive, and although their behavior will be reviewed\nevery 30 days to determine whether they deserve promotion to\nLevel 1, that determination is entirely within the discretion of\nprison administrators and is not linked to any particular infraction\nor compliance. While disciplinary segregation ordinarily has a\nspecified duration, inmates may remain in Level 2 and under the\npublication ban indefinitely. 8 In fact, several inmates have\nremained in Level 2 since the LTSU’s inception two years ago. As\nadministered, it is unclear how the policy would achieve the\ndeterrence it seeks. Not only is the rehabilitation justification\nillogical given the nature of LTSU confinement, but LTSU Level\n2 is a far cry from the disciplinary contexts in which such bans\nhave been deemed constitutional.\n\n       Furthermore, the DOC has offered no evidence that the rule\nachieves or could achieve its stated rehabilitative purpose. In\nWaterman, the DOC submitted affidavits from two psychologists\nwho testified that pornographic materials threatened to thwart the\neffectiveness of the treatment given to sex offenders and who\nagreed that limiting access to such material was a sensible\nrehabilitation strategy. 183 F.3d at 215. In Guajardo, the\ndefendants offered evidence as to the frequency and percentage of\n\n\n8\n In fact, disciplinary segregation is usually quite short in duration.\nIn Daigre, after addressing a guard profanely, Daigre was put in\n“administrative and punitive lockdown” for “a maximum of 10\ndays’ isolation” pursuant to a finding of “defiance.” 719 F.2d at\n1311. In Gregory, the challenged policy was in place for inmates\non Disciplinary Detention Status, which carried with it a 60-day\nmaximum duration. 768 F.2d at 290. In Guajardo, the court was\nevaluating a publication ban in place in solitary confinement, a\ntype of punitive segregation used as a sanction for violation of\nTexas Department of Corrections rules and regulations. An inmate\ncould be confined in solitary for a maximum of 15 days, and an\ninterval of at least three days was required between terms in\nsolitary, during which time the inmate could have access to any\npublications withheld during the term. 568 F. Supp. at 1366.\n                                  10\n\fsolitary confinements in the Texas Department of Corrections\n(“TDC”) which showed that the negative perception of solitary\nconfinement had a deterrent effect. 568 F. Supp. at 1368 (“a\nsignificant majority of TDC inmates have never experienced\nsolitary confinement and less than half of those who are confined\nin solitary return a second time”). Here, there are no such\nsupporting affidavits. The District Court presumably relied on\nSuperintendent Dickson’s testimony that the prohibition in\nquestion “gives us a means or method to say you comply, you\nmodify your behavior, and you can obtain these things, these\nprivileges,” and his explanation that “we’re very limited . . . in\nwhat we can and cannot deny or give to an inmate, and these are\nsome of the items that we feel are legitimate as incentives for\ninmate growth.” (App. 110) The District Court did not examine\nthe fit between the policy and its rehabilitative goals, whether the\nban was implemented in a way that could modify behavior, or\ninquire into whether the DOC’s deprivation theory of behavior\nmodification had any basis in real human psychology, or had\nproven effective with LTSU inmates. At oral argument, counsel\nfor the DOC said it was a “hope.” In fact, Banks argues that\ncontrary to the assertions of the prison authorities and the District\nCourt, isolating prisoners from the goings-on in the outside world\ntends to undercut any genuine rehabilitation. There is, again, no\nevidence in the record on this point, but Banks cites to language in\nseveral cases to support this assertion.9 It certainly seems relevant\n\n\n\n\n9\n Rehabilitative goals are “furthered by efforts to inform and\neducate inmates, and foster their involvement in the world outside\nthe prison gates.” Abdul Wali v.

In Spellman v. Hopper, there was testimony\nthat deprivation of reading materials in segregation can cause\n“psychological deterioration” which in turn can cause inmates\neither to be “very withdrawn and curl up in infancy, or [to]\nbecome acting out and aggressive people.” 95 F.

Security\n\n       With respect to security, the District Court held that there\nwas a valid rational connection between the ban on periodicals and\nphotographs in LTSU Level 2 and the constellation of security\nconcerns put forth by the DOC. We cannot conclude from the\nrecord that such a connection exists. This is so for two reasons.\n\n        First, there is no evidence in the record of the misuse of\nperiodicals or photographs in any of the ways described by the\nDOC. In fact, matches are not allowed in the LTSU. See also\nGregory, 768 F.2d at 289 (“cellblock fires have been eliminated\nentirely . . . by new regulations prohibiting inmates from\npossessing matches”). There was no testimony as to the frequency\nof fires in the LTSU, nor testimony about any particular fires, in or\nout of LTSU segregation, and how and with what materials they\n\n\n\n\n10\n  Our dissenting colleague contends that we misapply the first\nTurner factor by requiring the DOC to show some evidence to\nsupport its contention that the rule achieves or could achieve its\nstated rehabilitative purpose. However, our insistence that the\nDOC offer some evidence is not, in our view, at odds with Turner\nbut rather a complementary part of the analysis in determining\nwhether an asserted goal is logically connected to the prison\nregulation. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89 (requiring prison authorities\nto put forward a legitimate governmental interest justifying the\nregulation). Indeed, in Turner, the Supreme Court evaluated the\nevidence in determining whether the prison rules in question served\n- in theory or in practice - the alleged penological goals. See id. at\n91-93, 98-99. In our view, the paucity of any such evidence in this\nmatter reinforces the conclusion that there is no valid, rational\nconnection between the DOC rule and its stated rehabilitative\npurpose.\n                                    12\n\fwere set and fueled.11 The same is true for the materials’ potential\nuse as weapons.\n\n       Furthermore, there was no testimony as to the effect such a\nban has had on the frequency of fires, be it in the LTSU or\nelsewhere. In fact, Banks points out that inmates on Death Row,\nin Administrative Custody, and in the Special Management Unit\nare routinely permitted to have these items, and the DOC presented\nno evidence that the security or operations of these units are\nnegatively affected to any palpable degree by the presence of these\nitems.\n\n        The District Court dismissed this argument, agreeing with\nthe DOC that a comparison to other forms of segregation within the\nPennsylvania DOC is irrelevant because LTSU inmates are the\n“worst of the worst.” However, there is no evidence before us to\nindicate that what sets these inmates apart from the rest is their\nmisuse of non-legal or non-religious periodicals. The District\nCourt’s conclusion that “the fact that other segregated inmates have\nnot created the same security concerns while in possession of\nnewspapers and magazines is one reason they are in those units and\nnot in the LTSU” is an inference that finds no support in the record.\nIn fact, there is no indication in the record that any LTSU inmates\nwere transferred there because they had created a security risk with\nperiodicals or photographs. The LTSU inmates are certainly and\nunquestionably incorrigible, but whether their incorrigibility takes\nthe form described by the District Court is an open question which\ncannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage by making\ninferences in favor of the DOC and without support in the record.\n\n       Second, we agree with Banks that given the materials Level\n2 inmates are permitted in their cells, prohibiting a single\nnewspaper or magazine has no significant relationship to the stated\nsecurity objectives. There are many other non-prohibited means\n\n\n11\n  Superintendent Dickson testified only that within the last six\nmonths there were “no more than two or three” cell fires in the\nentirety of the LTSU, and “paper products generally are the way\nit’s first ignited.” He also testified that he did not know of any\ninstance where a LTSU Level 1 inmate used a newspaper or\nmagazine to start or fuel a fire. (App. 112)\n                                  13\n\ffor the inmates to fuel fires, hurl waste, conceal contraband and\ncreate weapons. Under current regulations, each inmate is given a\njumpsuit, a blanket, two bedsheets, a pillow case, a roll of toilet\npaper, a copy of a prison handbook, ten sheets of writing paper,\nseveral envelopes, carbon paper, three pairs of socks, three\nundershorts and three undershirts, and may at any point also have\nreligious newspapers, legal periodicals, a prison library book,\nBibles, and a lunch tray with a plate and a cup. Many of these\nitems are flammable, could be used for the above purposes as\neffectively as a newspaper, magazine or photograph, and have been\nso used by LTSU Level 2 inmates.12 The District Court again\nagreed with the DOC that the prohibition may not eliminate but\ncertainly reduces the security risks with which the DOC is\nconcerned, and that it is irrelevant that the policy does not\nabsolutely prevent the harms it addresses because Turner is not a\n“least-restrictive-alternative” test. Fraise, 283 F.3d at 520;\nWaterman, 183 F.3d at 219.\n\n       Although the District Court is correct that the policy need\nnot be narrowly tailored to the harm it addresses to pass\nconstitutional muster, its conclusion here has some flaws. Even if\nthe policy need not be “narrowly tailored” to the stated interests, if\nthe prohibition of newspapers, magazines and photographs has\nonly a minimal effect on security in the LTSU because of the other\nmaterials that they are permitted in the cells, the relationship\nbetween the policy and the penological interest may be too\nattenuated to be reasonable.13 It is important to note here that the\n\n12\n  In his deposition, Superintendent Dickson testified not only that\nunder the challenged policy there have still been cell fires and\nrashes of feces-flinging in LTSU level 2, but also that inmates can\nand do use other permitted materials to create these disturbances:\n“Oftentimes it’s with the cups that they’re given for their drinks,\nthings like that . . . a piece of paper or whatever . . . that they can\nuse to give a little leverage and fling the materials.” (App. 112)\n13\n  See Spellman, 95 F.

If other avenues are open for the\ninmate to exercise the right in question, the court should exhibit\ndeference to the judgment of corrections officials, while if no other\navenues are available, the inmate’s right is given greater weight in\nthe Turner balancing process. Id.15\n\n       Banks argues that while Level 2 inmates can read leisure\nbooks, they have no meaningful access to current news accounts or\npublished information about current political, social, or other\npublic events and activities occurring outside the prison walls, and\nthey have no way to look at images of loved ones and friends apart\nfrom the possibility of infrequent visits. The District Court,\nhowever, disagreeing with Banks, found that inmates had sufficient\nmeans to engage in the constitutionally-protected activities.\n\n        The District Court characterized the periodicals ban as “not\na blanket prohibition” because Level 2 inmates can qualify by good\nconduct to be promoted to LTSU Level 1. The District Court’s\njustification for this determination is its explanation that “each of\nthese prisoners has the option of modifying his behavior and being\npromoted to a less restricted environment where access to\nnewspapers magazines and photographs may be enjoyed.” (App.\n126) As the DOC elaborated in its brief, “there is no reason to\nsuppose that a prison administration would not respond favorably\nto a prisoner’s initiative to qualify for relief from the ban on\nperiodicals or photos through exhibiting good behavior.”\n\n\n\n\n15\n Although this inquiry depends in part on how the scope of the\nconstitutional right is defined, neither the parties nor the District\nCourt define the right in question, nor does the District Court’s\nanalysis depend on a particular understanding of the rights in\nquestion.\n                                 16\n\f       The District Court and the DOC are correct in noting that\ninmates can be promoted from Level 2 to Level 1 and, if they are,\nthey will gain access to the prohibited materials. However, that\ndoes not change the fact that the prohibition is indeed a “blanket”\none, and that as long as an inmate is at Level 2 status and is subject\nto the policy in question, he has no alternative means to exercise\nhis First Amendment right of access to a reasonable amount of\nnewspapers, magazines, and photographs.\n\n       Moreover, there is no reason to infer that the process of\n“promotion” from Level 2 to Level 1 is as much under the inmates’\ncontrol as the DOC and the District Court characterize it. As noted\nabove, segregation in Level 2 is not linked to a particular\ninfraction, and is of potentially unlimited duration. Any inmate\nwho enters LTSU will remain at Level 2 for 90 days no matter how\nhe modifies his behavior. Furthermore, the only information in the\nrecord as to how the process works is the following explanation\nfrom Dickson’s deposition:\n\n              You know, you have the ability through your own\n              actions to be promoted, if you will, from a level 2\n              inmate to a level 1 inmate, and we do that every day.\n              We have a system where the unit management team\n              reviews each inmate’s progress every thirty days.\n              The unit management team is made up of the unit\n              manager, custody staff, psych staff, nursing staff.\n              And we try to give and provide every inmate every\n              opportunity to progress through this system and to be\n              able to obtain these privileges. (App. 110)\n\n        There are no affidavits in the record from any of those\ndecision-makers mentioned by Dickson, nor is there any\ndocumentation of the review process. Although at Dickson’s\ndeposition, Banks’ attorney apparently examined and requested\nsome documents which indicated, with respect to current LTSU\ninmates, how long they had been at the facility and how long they\nhad been at Level 2, those documents are also not in the record.\nAgain, unlike the policies in solitary and disciplinary confinement\nexamined in Daigre, Gregory, and Guajarde, the LTSU prohibition\ncannot be characterized as merely a “time, place or manner”\nrestriction. See, e.g., Gregory, 768 F.2d at 290 (“[the policy is] not\n\n                                 17\n\fdirected at what mail an inmate could receive, but only at when he\ncould receive it”).\n\n       D.     Factors Three and Four : Accommodation\n\n        We now consider the District Court’s analysis of Turner’s\nthird and fourth factors. Under these factors, we must determine\nwhether the right in question can be accommodated without\nsignificant negative consequences in terms of efficiency and\nsecurity, DeHart, 227 F.3d at 58, and “whether the prison can\neasily serve its interests with alternative means without infringing\nupon the rights of prisoners,” Crofton v.

It is certainly supported by the record, as the District Court\nrepeatedly asserted, that the LTSU Level 2 inmates are some of the\nmost “intractable” in the Pennsylvania prison system. We cannot\nagree, however, on the record before us, that accommodation of\nthose prisoners’ rights by giving them reasonable access to a\nlimited number of periodicals and photographs would have such a\n“ripple effect.”\n\n16\n  A Security Threat Group (“STG”) is a group of inmates,\ndesignated by the Commissioner, which “poses a threat to the\nsafety of staff, other inmates, the community, and/or damages to,\nor destruction of property, and/or interrupting the safe secure and\norderly operation of the correctional facility(ies).” Fraise, 283 F.3d\nat 509.\n                                  18\n\f        At no point does Banks propose that Level 2 inmates be\nallowed unmitigated and unregulated access to all periodicals.\nRather, Banks proposes, and the District Court discussed, two\nalternative policies which would accommodate the prisoners’\nrights. First, the DOC could establish a specific reading period, or\nseveral different reading periods, in which guards deliver a single\nnewspaper or magazine to an inmate’s cell, if requested, and\nretrieve it at the close of the period. The DOC could easily control\nthe number of periodicals in his cell at one time, the frequency of\nthe distributions, the amount of time any inmate would be in\npossession of the materials, as well as the number of inmates who\nwould have periodicals in their cells at any one time.17 The DOC\ncould also limit the total number of photographs a Level 2 inmate\ncould have in his cell at one time to what they consider a\nreasonable number. In conjunction with this policy, access to\nperiodicals could be entirely withheld from those individual\nprisoners who, in the judgment of prison officials, would pose a\nparticular risk given their records, or those inmates who have\nabused their use of periodicals or photographs. The DOC asserts\nthat such a limited restriction would not prevent Level 2 inmates\nfrom using the materials to start fires, fling feces and create\nweapons and therefore, during the reading period, extra monitoring\nof cells would be required, thus affecting the prison’s resources and\npossibly the safety of other inmates.\n\n       We fail to see, however, as discussed above under factor\none, how an inmate’s hour-long possession of Graterfriends would\nrequire further monitoring when at any time that inmate may be in\npossession of 10 sheets of writing paper, and as many copies of the\nWatchtower, the Jewish Daily Forward, and the Christian Science\nMonitor Magazine as can fit in a records center box. As discussed\nabove, the District Court’s assumption that prisoners would be\nmore reluctant to use religious materials for such nefarious\npurposes is unsupported by the record. Furthermore, at any point,\nthe entire LTSU can house no more than 40 inmates, one-tenth of\none percent of the state’s prison population.

Although it is possible that the\ndemand for mini-law library sessions may increase if the policy\nwere changed, the DOC has not shown how this would\nsignificantly increase the burden on prison staff. Superintendent\nDickson explained in his deposition that under current LTSU\npolicy, one inmate is allowed out of his cell at a time to visit the\nlaw library for one two-hour session. A roster of requests, like a\nwaiting-list, is maintained and fulfilled on a first-come first-serve\nbasis. The amount or frequency of inmate movement is already\nregulated. If the inmates’ rights to read other periodicals were\naccommodated, that would not change. We fail to see how the\nmere addition of non-legal and non-religious periodicals to the\nmaterials already available to the inmates in the library would\ncreate the “ripple effect” cited by the DOC. In short, the DOC has\nnot shown that a change in the publication ban would mean\n“significantly less liberty and safety for everyone else, guards and\n\n18\n  Here, the District Court relies on Allah v.

Pa. 2002), in which the court found that\nthe third Turner factor weighed in the prison authorities’ favor\nbecause the inmate was particularly ill-behaved and\naccommodating his presence at religious services would require\nmore monitoring of those services, thereby straining prison\nresources and affecting the prison staff and other inmates.\nAlthough the Turner factors are evaluated independently, it is\nimportant to note with respect to this decision that the prison policy\nwas much narrower and the court’s analysis was informed by the\nfact that the inmate had many meaningful ways to practice his\nreligion without attending services. He could meditate, pray and\nstudy his religion, as well as discuss it with other inmates outside\nhis cell. Id.\n                                  20\n\fother prisoners alike.” Abbott, 490 U.S. at 418 (quoting Turner,\n482 U.S. at 92).\n\n        Finally, the District Court asserted that the alternatives\nproposed come at more than a de minimus cost to the DOC’s\nbehavior modification goals because the accessibility of periodicals\nwould render the threat of Level 2 segregation toothless as a\ndeterrent. However, the District Court overlooked the extent to\nwhich, even without the challenged restriction, Level 2 LTSU\nsegregation is more restrictive than Level 1 in significant respects.\nFor example, Level 1 inmates are permitted two family visits and\none fifteen minute telephone call per month. They are also\npermitted to spend $5.00 per week at the commissary on items\ndefined by the Unit Team. Additionally, while inmates at both\nlevels receive in-cell counseling and visits from chaplains, and can\nbe employed as Unit Janitor, only Level 1 inmates receive\ncompensation as per DC-816 Inmate Compensation System, and\nonly Level 1 inmates are permitted GED and Special Education in-\ncell study. (App. 32)\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we believe that the DOC’s\npolicy that prohibits inmates confined in the LTSU at Level 2\nstatus access to photographs, and all newspapers and magazines\nwhich are neither legal nor religious in nature, cannot be supported\nas a matter of law by the record in this case. Accordingly, the\nsummary judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the\ncase remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nALITO, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n        At issue in this case are restrictions that the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections imposes as a last resort on the most\ndisruptive and dangerous .1% of its prison population. These\nrestrictions apply only as long as an inmate remains in Level 2 of\nthe LTSU, an assignment that may terminate after as little as 90\ndays. The question before us is whether these temporary, last-\nresort restrictions are facially unconstitutional under the standard\nset out in Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), a standard that\ninstructs courts to extend considerable deference to judgments of\n\n                                 21\n\fcorrectional officials. Because I believe that the majority has\nmisapplied Turner, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n       Under Turner, prison regulations that restrict constitutional\nrights must be sustained if they are “reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.” 482 U.S. at 89. Turner noted four\nfactors to be considered in determining whether the requisite\nreasonable relationship exists: (1) whether there is “a ‘valid,\nrational connection’ between the prison regulation and the\nlegitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it”; (2)\n“whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that\nremain open to prison inmates”; (3) “the impact accommodation of\nthe asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other\ninmates”; and (4) whether there are “ready alternatives” to the\nchallenged regulation.” Id. at 89-90 (citation omitted). I will\naddress each factor.\n\n        First factor: Rational relationship between regulation\nand legitimate penological interests. I agree with the District\nCourt that this factor weighs in favor of the constitutionality of the\nchallenged regulations because there is a “rational” relationship\nbetween that restriction and the legitimate penological objective of\ndeterring misconduct. It is “rational” for corrections officials to\nthink that inmates who are not in Level 2 will be deterred from\nengaging in serious misconduct because they do not want to be\ntransferred to that unit and thus to be subjected to the restrictions\nthat accompany that assignment. It is also “rational” for\ncorrections officials to think that inmates who are in Level 2 will\nbe deterred from engaging in serious misconduct while in that unit\nbecause they wish to be transferred out and thus to escape such\nrestrictions.\n\n       The majority disagrees with these conclusions for two\nreasons. First, the majority apparently believes that a sanction\ncannot deter unless a potential violator knows with some\nspecificity the type misconduct that will result in the imposition of\nthe sanction and the length of time that the sanction will last. The\nmajority concedes that “deterrence of future infractions of prison\nrules can be an appropriate justification for temporarily restricting\nthe rights of inmates” and that other courts of appeals have\nsustained rules restricting the receipt of newspapers by prisoners in\ndisciplinary segregation. See Maj. at 9 (citing Gregory v. Auger,\n                                 22\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455908\"><a href=\"/opinion/455908/leonard-gregory-jr-v-warden-calvin-auger-assistant-warden-sissel-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290 (8 th Cir. 1985); Daigre v. M aggio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426282\"><a href=\"/opinion/426282/preston-harold-daigre-v-ross-maggio-jr-warden-louisiana-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1313 (5 th Cir. 1983)). The majority finds these precedents\ninapplicable because the “LTSU is not a place where inmates are\nsent for a discrete period of punishment, pursuant to a specific\ninfraction, but a place for ‘Long Term’ segregation of the most\nincorrigible and difficult prisoners for as long as they fall under\nthat umbrella.” Id.\n\n        The majority’s reasoning is unsound. The uncertainties\nnoted by the majority may diminish the deterrent effect of the\nregulations on some inmates who are not yet in Level 2, but there\nis no reason to think that these uncertainties entirely eliminate the\ndeterrent effect of the regulations on the general prison population.\nSimilarly, it is rational to believe that the challenged restrictions\nprovide an incentive for those inmates who are already in Level 2\nto refrain from disruptive behavior in the hope of obtaining a\ntransfer out of the unit. Again, uncertainty about what must be\ndone to obtain such a transfer or about when such a transfer may be\navailable may have an impact on the degree of the incentive, but\nthere is no reason to suppose that the incentive is wholly destroyed.\n\n        Second, the majority concludes that the regulations are not\nrationally related to the goal of deterring misconduct because “the\nDOC has offered no evidence that the rule achieves or could\nachieve its stated rehabilitative purpose.” Maj. Op. at 10. In taking\nthis approach, the majority misconstrues the nature of the first\nTurner factor. This factor requires us to determine whether there\nis a “logical connection between the regulation and the asserted\ngoal,” see 482 U.S. at 89 (emphasis added), not whether there is\nempirical evidence that the regulation in fact serves that goal. The\nentire system of prison discipline might be imperilled if each\nsanction for prison misconduct could not be sustained without\nempirical evidence that the sanction provided some incremental\ndeterrent.\n\n        Second factor: alternative means of exercising the right.\nThis is the most troubling of the four factors, but I do not think that\nit is sufficient to support the majority’s conclusion that the\nregulations are facially unconstitutional. The regulations impinge\nupon the right to receive information about current events and\ncommunications (in the form of photographs) from family\nmembers and friends, but the restrictions are not absolute. Inmates\n                                  23\n\fin Level 2 may still read books from the prison library and may\nreceive letters. Moreover, as the District Court noted, inmates in\nLevel 2 have the “option of modifying their behavior and being\npromoted to a less restricted environment.”            Report &\nRecommendation at 8. An as-applied challenge by an inmate\nsubjected to lengthy confinement in Level 2 despite a record of\nreformed behavior would present different considerations, but the\nmajority’s opinion is not limited to such a case.\n\n       Third and fourth factors: Availability and impact of\naccommodation. The majority proposes modifications in prison\npolicies that would almost certainly have an impact on prison\nresources. The majority first suggests that guards could deliver\nrequested newspapers and magazines to inmates’ cells and then\nretrieve these materials after the expiration of a specified “reading\nperiod.” Maj. Op. at 18. Providing this service for each of the 40\ninmates in Level 2 would be time consuming. “Alternatively,” the\nmajority states, “individual prisoners could be escorted to [the]\nsecure mini-law library to read a periodical of their choosing.”\nMaj. Op. at 19. This service, however, would undoubtedly impose\na significant burden, particularly since the inmates in question are\nthose whom the Department of Corrections has classified as the\nmost violent and disruptive. It is Department policy that Level 2\ninmates may not be transported from their cells unless they are\nplaced in hand and leg irons and are escorted by two officers.\n\n       Taking into account all four of the Turner factors, I\nconclude that the challenged regulations are not facially\nunconstitutional. On their face, these regulations are reasonably\nrelated to the legitimate penological goal of curbing prison\nmisconduct, and I would therefore affirm the decision of the\nDistrict Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\f</pre>",
