DRAIN, District Judge. Defendant Abdullahi Farah was\nconvicted after a two-day jury trial of violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), for willfully\ndisobeying an order requiring his testimony by deposition for use in a separate criminal\nprosecution and for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), which prohibits the obstruction, or\nthe attempt to obstruct the enforcement of §1591(a), a child sex trafficking statute.\nFarah’s conviction stems from his refusal to testify in the ongoing criminal prosecution\nof thirty gang members of Somalian descent charged in the United States District Court\nfor the Middle District of Tennessee with several conspiracies including sex trafficking\nof minors, interstate transportation of stolen goods and other offenses.1\n\n       Because we conclude Farah’s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3)\nviolates the Double Jeopardy Clause and the rule announced in Yates v. United States,\n355 U.S. 66, 78 S. Ct. 128, 2 L. Ed. 2d 95 (1957), we VACATE his judgment of\nconviction on that count. However, Farah’s Double Jeopardy rights were only violated\nin part because he was also convicted of obstructing or attempting to obstruct the child\nsex trafficking laws, thus his conviction on that count passes the “same elements” test\nannounced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed.\n306 (1932). We further find that none of Farah’s remaining claims challenging his\nconviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) have merit, thus his judgment of conviction\nas to that count is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           United States v. Abdifitah Adan, 3:10-260.\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                 Page 3\n\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       Farah has been a member of the Somali Outlaws gang for nearly a decade,\nalthough during the course of the proceedings below, he has since renounced his\nmembership and affiliation with the gang. In 2010, while detained in immigration\ncustody in Ramsey County, Minnesota,2 Farah was approached by the Government\nabout an incident occurring in Nashville. Farah ultimately agreed to offer his assistance\nwith respect to the Government’s investigation. Farah believed that in exchange for his\ncooperation he would receive immunity from prosecution, reversal of the revocation of\nhis work permit, help obtaining his citizenship and release from custody.\n\n       Farah was granted transactional immunity and testified before the grand jury on\nthree separate occasions. He also assisted with the identification of gang members and\nprovided reliable information concerning the locations of many of the Adan defendants\nat the time the Government filed the charges and brought the Adan defendants into\ncustody in the fall of 2010.\n\n       Farah claims that after the Adan indictment was filed, other gang members in the\ncommunity began to suspect that he was supplying information to the Government\nbecause he was not indicted. He claims he was assaulted twice during the latter half of\n2011. The first time he claims he was pistol whipped and beaten by four masked men\nnear his home. The men threatened to kill him and harm his family. While Farah was\nin constant contact with Government agents during this time, when questioned by an\nagent about a cut above his eye resulting from the purported assault, Farah claimed he\nobtained the injury while playing basketball. He also claims he was assaulted right\nbefore the Christmas holiday that same year.\n\n       The Adan case was severed into separate trials by the trial court, with the first\ntrial commencing in March of 2012. Farah was arrested on a material witness warrant\na month before the commencement of the trial. A detention hearing was held before a\n\n\n\n       2\n           Farah has several prior convictions and removal proceedings have been initiated.\n\fNo. 13-6147           United States v. Farah                                                 Page 4\n\n\nmagistrate judge who determined that there were no conditions or combination of\nconditions that could reasonably assure Farah’s appearance and ordered his detention as\na material witness in the Adan case. The district judge presiding over the Adan case\nrecused himself from all material witness proceedings dealing with Farah and a separate\ncase was opened.3\n\n        On April 18, 2012, Farah made his appearance before a district judge based on\nthe Government’s “motion for a hearing related to witness’s refusal to testify.” The\nGovernment indicated that it had reached the point in the Adan trial for Farah’s\ntestimony and his “anticipated testimony would relate to the sex trafficking of [the]\nindividual known as Jane Doe 2, as well as relating to information known about the\nventure, which is a requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) . . . [h]e would also have\nthe information about . . . identifying particular defendants’ voices. And that’s it in a\nnutshell, Your Honor, as to materiality.” Farah, who was represented by counsel at the\nhearing, informed the district judge that he refused to testify.\n\n        EXAMINATION BY THE COURT:\n        Q:       Mr. Farah, the government has filed a motion asking me to\n                 compel you to testify in the Adan case that is being tried before\n                 Judge Haynes down the hall. I first want to establish whether you\n                 are willing to testify in that case. Are you willing to testify in that\n                 case?\n        A.       No, Your Honor.\n\nFarah explained to the Court that he was refusing to testify because: “I was coercion and\nI was pressured to testify from the beginning. It wasn’t my choice. I was either\nthreatened to go to jail or be indicted upon the case or either testify.” Farah claimed the\nGovernment had lied to him and his safety was in jeopardy, however he failed to inform\nthe court that he was twice assaulted by gang members and his family had been\nthreatened in the preceding year.\n\n\n\n        3\n          The district judge recused himself because his son worked at the same law firm that Farah’s\ndefense counsel worked.\n\fNo. 13-6147             United States v. Farah                                                       Page 5\n\n\n         The district judge concluded that Farah failed to establish just cause for his\nrefusal to testify, ordered him to testify for the prosecution in the ongoing Adan trial, and\nfound him in civil contempt. He also ordered Farah’s detention for the remainder of the\ntrial unless Farah purged himself of the contempt by testifying. The next day, another\nhearing was held to determine whether Farah would testify, but Farah indicated that his\nposition had not changed. The district judge reserved consideration of the Government’s\noral request to find Farah in criminal contempt until the conclusion of the trial, and again\ninformed Farah that the civil contempt could be purged upon his decision to testify.\nUpon the conclusion of the trial in Adan,4 the district judge set a trial date for the\nGovernment’s motion to hold Farah in criminal contempt.\n\n         A June 2012 bench trial was held and Farah was found guilty of criminal\ncontempt. At the trial, Farah testified about the two assaults in 2011, however the\ndistrict judge had serious doubts about his credibility particularly in light of his conduct\njust prior to his arrest. The district judge concluded that:\n\n         [T]he Court clearly ordered the defendant to testify. It was an ongoing\n         trial. He was to be called as a witness on the day that we had the initial\n         hearing, the 18th of April. And the defendant was clearly ordered to\n         testify, and he refused. So he had the benefit of a clear and definite order,\n         and he knew of the order.\n\n         Sentencing was held on July 3, 2012. The district judge began by noting that the\nstatutory maximum for criminal contempt was six-months imprisonment, but ultimately\ndetermined the statutory maximum was “not called for” under the circumstances\nbecause:\n\n         [I]f Mr. Farah repeats his conduct of failing to testify in legal\n         proceedings, the Court wants to have the flexibility to impose a graduated\n         sentence, meaning for there to be additional possibility of more\n\n         4\n           The jury returned guilty verdicts as to 3 defendants and 6 defendants were acquitted. The district\njudge later vacated the convictions and granted new trials for the three convicted defendants. As of the\ndate of this opinion, no more trials have been held in this matter. The record reveals 3-6 trials will be held\nas to the remaining Adan defendants. A trial set for October of 2013 did not take place and there have\nbeen no further trials scheduled. Since the first trial, five defendants have entered guilty pleas to counts\nunrelated to the sex trafficking counts and received sentences ranging from time served to forty-eight-\nmonths imprisonment.\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                     Page 6\n\n\n         punishment if we are simply here in a few months doing this same\n         proceeding.\n\nFarah’s counsel lodged an objection to this portion of the district judge’s ruling:\n\n         [I]t appears the Court is at least considering the possibility that if Mr.\n         Farah was charged with and tried for an additional contempt charge for\n         refusing to testify, he could be again convicted. It is now and will be my\n         position that that would be double jeopardy. Mr. Farah has said he will\n         not testify against the gang members. And the fact that the government\n         has divided this case into multiple cases5 doesn’t change the fact that he\n         has committed one act of contempt and that is the only act of contempt.\n         He should not be held in multiple contempts because of the government’s\n         decision to bifurcate the trials. I am making that objection now because\n         I raised it earlier.\n\n         While Farah was serving his four month sentence, his attorney filed a motion for\nreview of the order detaining him as a material witness requesting that Farah be released\nafter the conclusion of his sentence for criminal contempt, or in early October 2012,\nbecause further detention at that point implicated constitutional considerations because\nnone of the remaining trials had been set in the Adan case. A hearing was held before\nthe district judge on August 23, 2012.\n\n         At the hearing, the district judge began by stating the procedural posture of the\ncase:\n\n         Farah[] has filed a motion for the review of the detention order of the\n         magistrate judge, . . . Docket Number 19 entered on May 16, 2012. It in\n         turn relies on the detention order in Case Number 12-2029. And just to\n         try to keep things clear, the detention order in the Case 3:12-85 was a\n         detention for Mr. Farah as a defendant in the criminal case dealing with\n         criminal contempt. But that order relies on the reasons stated for\n         detaining Mr. Farah in Case Number 12-2029 as a material witness. So\n         it is all interrelated.\n\n\n\n\n         5\n          The record is not clear as to whether the Government requested that the trial proceed in stages,\nor whether the district judge determined that multiple trials were necessary for court administrative\npurposes, or whether both desired to resolve the Adan prosecution in separate trials.\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                             Page 7\n\n\nDefense counsel argued that once Farah served the remaining term of his sentence for\ncriminal contempt, he should be released because continued confinement as a material\nwitness was unjust under the circumstances:\n\n       [O]nce he serves his remaining two months [he] will be arguably being\n       held in detention with no trial date set, no idea when trial dates will be\n       set, and no idea how many trials he will be asked to testify in, which\n       could potentially go on for years. This is all in light of the fact that he’s\n       already told this Court and is suffering the consequences of it that he will\n       not testify against the Somali gang, meaning he won’t be providing\n       testimony in any of those upcoming trials.\n\nThe district judge inquired if a deposition could be taken pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3144.\nDefense counsel responded that, while he raised the subject of a deposition in his motion,\nhe inartfully did so and meant to argue that such an endeavor would be futile because\nFarah would not change his stance regarding testifying in the Adan matter. The\nGovernment requested that Farah’s testimony by deposition be ordered by the court,\nhowever neither the Government nor the district judge addressed the requirements for\nordering a deposition pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3144. The district judge took the matter\nunder advisement and later granted the request in an August 23, 2012 summary order.\n\n       The deposition was held at the courthouse on September 12, 2012, and the Adan\ndefendants, and their counsel, were either present or waived their presence. At the\ndeposition, the Government began by stating the purpose of the deposition was for use\n“at trial in relation to the matter of United States v. Adan 3:10-00260.” The Government\nproceeded to ask Farah if he would answer questions regarding issues involved in the\nremaining trials for which the Government sought his testimony. Farah persisted in his\nrefusal and indicated he would not testify in any of the trials.6\n\n       After the deposition, the Government moved to hold Farah in civil contempt\nbased on his refusal to testify at the deposition.                 The district judge denied the\nGovernment’s motion, finding in relevant part:\n\n\n\n       6\n           Farah was not placed under oath prior to questioning.\n\fNo. 13-6147             United States v. Farah                                         Page 8\n\n\n        The Court concludes that holding Mr. Farah in civil contempt at this\n        stage of the proceedings is not appropriate. The Court ordered the\n        deposition of Mr. Farah in order to secure his testimony and eliminate the\n        need for his appearance as a witness at future trials in the Adan case. Mr.\n        Farah’s refusal to testify at the deposition is tantamount to refusing to\n        testify at each of the upcoming trials. Therefore, Mr. Farah no longer\n        needs an opportunity to purge himself of the contempt, as is contemplated\n        by the imposition of civil contempt. Instead, the Government may seek\n        to charge Mr. Farah with criminal contempt for his refusal to testify at the\n        deposition, or alternatively, may seek to have the grand jury issue an\n        indictment for obstruction of justice or other appropriate charges.\n\n        On October 3, 2012, the Government filed the three-count indictment giving rise\nto the instant action.7 Count One of the indictment charged Farah with violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 401(1) for “willfully and knowingly misbehav[ing] in the presence of the\n[district judge]. . . or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice in” both\nFarah [3:12-85] and the Adan actions by refusing to testify at the deposition. Count Two\ncharged Farah with “willfully and knowingly disobey[ing] and resist[ing]” the August\n2012 order issued in the cases of Farah [3:12-85] and Adan by refusing to testify.\nLastly, Farah was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), which punishes\ninterference with the enforcement of child sex trafficking laws.\n\n        The district judge presiding over Farah’s material witness and contempt\nproceedings entered an order of recusal because he was mentioned in the body of the\nindictment and the matter was assigned to a different district judge. Thereafter, Farah\nfiled a motion to dismiss arguing that the indictment violated the constitutional\nprohibition against double jeopardy, among other things. The district judge denied this\nmotion, as well as Farah’s motion to compel discovery related to Somali gangs and\nwitness retaliation and his motion to permit the use of an expert on street gang behavior.\nAt a pre-trial hearing, the district judge informed the parties that he would not permit\nFarah to present a duress defense at trial.\n\n\n\n\n        7\n            United States v. Abdullahi Farah, 3:12-00196.\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                           Page 9\n\n\n       The trial commenced on April 16, 2013. The Government introduced the August\n2012 order and the Notice of Deposition which stated that the purpose of the deposition\nwas for use in the Adan case. The parties stipulated to the introduction of evidence that\n“on or before September 12, 2012,” Farah had “material information relating to the\nenforcement of” 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1) & (a)(2), and 1594(c) and that on that same\ndate, the Government was “engaged in the enforcement” of federal laws including\n“violation of Title 18, USC, Sections 1512(b)(1), 1512(b)(2), 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(1), and\n1512(c)(2), including prosecution” in the Adan matter. The jury heard from two law\nenforcement officials who were present at the deposition, and both testified that Farah\nstated he would not provide testimony for any of the remaining Adan trials.\n\n       The jury found Farah guilty of all three counts charged in the indictment,\nhowever the district judge subsequently granted Farah’s motion for judgment of acquittal\nin part and set aside Farah’s conviction as to Count One. Farah was sentenced to a term\nof 15-months imprisonment for Counts Two and Three, to run concurrently. Farah’s\ntimely appeal followed.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       Farah argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and his\nconvictions should be vacated because the indictment violated the double jeopardy clause\nof the Fifth Amendment. His refusal to testify at the deposition was a continuation of\nhis conduct in April of 2012–conduct which forms the basis of his prior contempt\nconviction. He maintains that the Government seeks to transform his single act of\ncontempt into multiple acts of contempt to improperly impose additional punishment.\n\n       Conversely, the Government argues that the double jeopardy clause is not\nimplicated here because Farah’s first contempt was based upon his refusal to testify\nduring the first Adan trial, while the indictment at issue herein arose from his failure to\ncomply with a court order to provide deposition testimony after the conclusion of the\nfirst trial in Adan. Moreover, the instant action charges Farah with the additional crime\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 10\n\n\nof violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), a charge that was not the subject of the 2012 contempt\ntrial or resulting conviction.\n\n        Double jeopardy claims are questions of law that require de novo review. United\nStates v. Anderson-Bagshaw, 509 F. App’x 396, 411 (6th Cir. 2012); United States v.\nDakota, 197 F.3d 821, 826 (6th Cir. 1999). The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth\nAmendment provides that no person shall “be subject for the same offence to be twice\nput in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. The clause protects criminal\ndefendants from successive prosecutions for the same offense after acquittal or\nconviction, as well as from multiple punishments for the same offense. Brown v. Ohio,\n432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977). “[T]he Fifth\nAmendment double jeopardy guarantee serves principally as a restraint on courts and\nprosecutors.” Id.\n\n        The traditional test for double jeopardy claims is the “same elements” test set\nforth in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306\n(1932). While Blockburger is normally the measure of constitutional compliance, “it is\nnot the only standard for determining whether successive prosecutions impermissibly\ninvolve the same offense.” Brown, 432 U.S. at 166 n.6; see also Rashad v. Burt,\n108 F.3d 677, 679 (6th Cir. 1997) (“[T]he Blockburger test is insufficient where, as here,\nthe concern is not multiple charges under separate statutes, but rather successive\nprosecutions for conduct that may constitute the same act or transaction.”).\n\n        As an initial matter, it appears that reliance on the Blockburger test alone will not\naddress the various issues raised by Farah’s convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) and\n18 U.S. C. § 1591(d). In Rashad, a panel of this Court explained that:\n\n        The Blockburger test is designed to deal with the situation where closely\n        connected conduct results in multiple charges under separate statutes.\n        In a Blockburger case, the critical question is whether the multiple\n        charges in reality constitute the same offense. Thus, the Blockburger test\n        focuses on whether the statutory elements of the two crimes charged are\n        duplicative.\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                         Page 11\n\n\nRashad, 108 F.3d at 679 (emphasis supplied). The defendant in Rashad argued that his\nconviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine after an earlier conviction for\npossession and delivery of the same substance violated his rights under the double\njeopardy clause. Id. at 678. The arresting officers in Rashad discovered cocaine in both\nhis house and car. Id. at 679. The defendant’s first trial for possession with intent to\ndeliver involved the cocaine seized from his residence. Id. at 680. Roughly six months\nlater, he was tried for possession with intent to deliver in connection with the cocaine\nseized from his car. Id. The Rashad court concluded that the second prosecution\nviolated the defendant’s double jeopardy rights because the “possession of cocaine in his\nhome and in his automobile constituted a single transaction.” Id. at 680-81.\n\n        Farah argues that Rashad is similar to the facts of his case, however his reliance\nis misplaced. The holding in Rashad has been limited by subsequent decisions of this\nCourt. See United States v. Forman, 180 F.3d 766 (6th Cir. 1999); Murr v. United\nStates, 200 F.3d 895 (6th Cir. 2000). In Murr, we rejected the defendant’s argument that\nRashad compelled the conclusion that his double jeopardy rights had been violated when\nhe was prosecuted for narcotics offenses in the federal district court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Kentucky after pleading guilty to narcotics charges brought in the federal\ndistrict court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Murr, 200 F.3d at 901. In rejecting\nthe defendant’s argument, we noted that Rashad is “limited to its unique facts, in that\n‘the issue . . . was whether the defendant had committed one as opposed to two discrete\nviolations of the same statute, not whether the defendant was charged twice for the same\nviolation.’” Id. (quoting Forman, 180 F.3d at 769). As such, use of Rashad to resolve\ndouble jeopardy questions is limited “to circumstances such as were present in th[at]\ncase.” Id. Here, the facts of Farah’s case are unlike those present in Rashad, thus its\napplication is inappropriate.\n\n        The Government argues that United States v. Johnson, 736 F.2d 358 (6th Cir.\n1984) supports its contention, however the Government’s reliance on this case is\nmisplaced. The issue in Johnson concerned whether an individual could be confined for\ncivil contempt based on “anticipatory contempt” or refusal to testify at a future trial when\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 12\n\n\nno trial date had been set. Id. at 360. There was no anticipatory contempt here as Farah\nindicated in April of 2012 during the ongoing Adan proceedings that he would not\ntestify. Additionally, civil contempt is concerned with forcing the witness to purge\nhimself of the contempt, whereas criminal contempt is aimed at punishing the witness.\nJohnson likewise fails to provide the Court with any guidance.\n\n        The most appropriate authority to begin with is that of Yates v. United States,\n355 U.S. 66, 78 S. Ct. 128, 2 L. Ed. 2d 95 (1957), where the United States Supreme\nCourt vacated all contempt violations save for one concluding “the prosecution cannot\nmultiply contempts by repeated questioning on the same subject of inquiry within which\na recalcitrant witness already refused answers.” Id. at 73. On June 26, 1952, during the\nfirst day of the petitioner’s cross examination in her trial charging violation of the Smith\nAct, she refused to answer “four questions about the Communist membership of a\nnondefendant and of a codefendant who had rested his case.” Id. at 68. She stated that\nno matter the number of times she was asked “to identify a person as a communist, [she]\ncan’t bring [herself] to do it . . . .” Id. She was found guilty of civil contempt and\ncommitted to jail. Id. On the third day of trial, she again refused to answer eleven\nquestions asking her to identify members of the Communist party. Id. at 69. The trial\ncourt found her guilty of eleven separate criminal contempts. Id. In vacating all but the\nfirst of the contempt charges, the Supreme Court held:\n\n        Even though we assume the Government correct in its contention that the\n        11 questions in this case covered more than a single subject of inquiry,\n        it appears that every question fell within the area of refusal established by\n        the petitioner on the first day of her cross-examination . . . . Having once\n        carved out an area of refusal [on June 26, 1952], petitioner remained\n        within its boundaries in all her subsequent refusals.\n\nId. at 73-74. Farah also relies on Yates, and argues the Government is “attempting to\nmultiply contempts by repeated questioning on the same subject matter of inquiry within\nwhich Mr. Farah has already refused answers.”\n\n        Thus, based on the rule announced in Yates, at least with respect to Farah’s\nconviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), the appropriate question is whether Farah’s\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 13\n\n\ncriminal contempt for refusal to testify in April of 2012, and subsequent identical refusal\nand conviction constitute improper contempt multiplication in contravention of the\ndouble jeopardy clause. At the hearing in April of 2012, Farah indicated that he would\nnot testify for the prosecution in the “Adan case” when asked by the district judge on two\noccasions. As in Yates, Farah “had flatly refused on [April 18, 2012] to answer any\nquestions and had maintained such a position. . . . Having once carved out an area of\nrefusal, [Farah] remained within its boundaries in all h[is] subsequent refusals.” Yates,\n355 U.S. at 73-74. Farah’s refusal to testify was carved out in April of 2012 and his\nsubsequent refusals “fell within the limits drawn” at the April 18, 2012 hearing and “only\none contempt is shown on the facts of this case.” Id. at 74.\n\n       As such, Farah’s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) violates Yates.\nFarah’s 2013 conviction stems from his refusal in April of the previous year to testify in\nthe Adan case, conduct which he had already been charged and punished for in June of\n2012. Farah’s contempt, like the petitioner in Yates, was continuing and the Government\ncould not tack on multiple punishments. While the Adan case was separated into\ndifferent trials, Farah’s testimony concerned the same subject matter–evidence of the\ngang’s conspiratorial child sex trafficking activities. Just because a case has been\nsevered into separate trials does not provide the Government an opportunity to tack on\ncriminal contempts in this fashion. A defendant’s risk of re-incarceration and the\nnumber of criminal contempts for the same refusal to provide testimony on the same\nsubject conspiracies should not be controlled by the nature of trial practice and court\ndocketing considerations. The Government’s argument that the contempts involve\nseparate transactions is unpersuasive.\n\n       While Yates is clearly dispositive of the issue, it should be noted that Farah fails\nto elaborate on Yates and its progeny and the Government fails to address Yates\naltogether. The case law in this area is surprisingly sparse and the courts that have\naddressed this issue in similar contexts–although never quite factually on point with the\ncircumstances present here–are widely divergent concerning when the government has\nimproperly multiplied contempts in contravention of Yates or its reasoning. The cases\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 14\n\n\nthat are the strongest support for Farah include Baker v. Eisenstadt, 456 F.2d 382 (1st\nCir. 1972); United States v. Orman, 207 F.2d 148 (3d Cir. 1953); and People ex rel.\nAmarante v. McDonnell, 100 N.Y.S.2d 463 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1950).\n\n        There are cases that appear to contravene Farah, however these cases are, for the\nmost part, either factually dissimilar in a significant way or make conclusions without\nsubstantive factual and merits determinations. As such, the majority respectfully\ndisagrees with the dissent’s suggestion that “our sister circuits stand firmly against” the\nconclusion reached herein concerning Farah’s double jeopardy rights. See In re Boyden,\n675 F.2d 643 (5th Cir. 1982) (permitting multiple contempts for refusal to testify in\nseparate trials having a common origin because the trials involved different subject\nmatters, as well as because “there is no indication that appellant was called for the sole\npurpose of being bludgeoned with contempt penalties . . . .”); In the Matter of Chase,\n468 F.2d 128 (7th Cir. 1972) (allowing multiple criminal contempts when defendant\nrepeatedly refused to stand up during a lengthy trial in defiance of the district court’s\norder to do so); United States v. Smith, 532 F.2d 158 (10th Cir. 1976) (allowing two\ncriminal contempts for the defendant’s refusal to testify in two successive trials because\n“the government had reason to expect that the defendant would testify” at the second\ntrial), United States v. Coachman, 752 F.2d 685 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (allowing two criminal\ncontempts where appellants refused to testify before the grand jury and later during the\ntrial because the appellants impeded two distinct government functions–investigation by\nthe grand jury and the court in trying the crime–“witness contemptuous conduct in both\noperations defies governmental authority in each of those separate manifestations, and\nis guilty of separate contempts”); United States ex rel. Ushkowitz v. McCloskey, 359 F.2d\n788, 789 (2d Cir. 1966) (three criminal contempts upheld where appellants were\nsubpoenaed to testify before the grand jury and were convicted of contempt for refusing\nto testify, and after each term of imprisonment, they would again be subpoenaed to\ntestify before the grand jury, refuse to testify and be found in contempt); United States\nv. Costello, 198 F.2d 200 (2d Cir. 1952) (Yates relied on this decision, which permitted\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 15\n\n\none contempt per day during a United States Senate Crime Investigation Committee\ninvestigation).\n\n        In the majority’s view, the dissent applies Yates too narrowly and ignores other\nsister circuit authority supporting Farah’s position. See Baker v. Eisenstadt, 456 F.2d\n382 (1st Cir. 1972); United States v. Orman, 207 F.2d 148 (3d Cir. 1953). For instance,\nin Baker, the First Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the district court improperly\nmultiplied contempts against the petitioner for refusing to testify concerning allegations\nof judicial misconduct on the part of two judges of the Massachusetts Superior Court.\nId. at 384, 395. The Baker petitioner refused to testify on the subject inquiry and upon\nlater being re-called to the stand, again refused to testify. Id. at 385. Forty-five\nsubstantive questions were asked, and the petitioner refused to answer each question and\nwas held in contempt for each refusal. Id. In concluding the multiple contempts were\nimposed in error, the Baker court held:\n\n        We therefore conclude that petitioner’s contempt lay in refusing to testify\n        at all on the subject inquiry, that his communicated intent made it clear\n        at the outset that the authority of the Court was frontally challenged and\n        the seriousness of the offense fully delineated, and that the contempt\n        could not therefore be multiplied . . . by running through the entire list of\n        questions.\n\nId. at 393 (emphasis supplied); see also United States v. Orman, 207 F.2d at 160 (noting\nthat “where the separate questions . . . relate to but a single subject of inquiry, only one\npenalty for contempt may be imposed” and “[w]here the witness has refused to give any\ntestimony, a committee cannot multiply his contempt by continuing to ask him questions\neach time eliciting the same answer.”).\n\n        Farah clearly declined to testify concerning the Somali Outlaws’ sex trafficking\nof minors in the Adan case in April of 2012. The dissent’s reliance on the fact that the\nproceedings were “separate” is the improper focus and an improper application of Yates.\nThe fact that the proceedings were “separate” does not alter the fact that the proceedings\nboth dealt with the Adan indictment’s allegations relating to the gang’s conspiracy to\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                        Page 16\n\n\nengage in the sex trafficking of minors–the topic to which Farah clearly indicated a\nrefusal to testify about in April of 2012.\n\n        The majority further rejects the Government’s contention and the dissent’s\nagreement that Bullock v. United States, 265 F.2d 683 (6th Cir. 1959) is “the most\nanalogous binding precedent.” Bullock is distinguishable on the facts and therefore\nprovides no guidance to the Court. In Bullock, the defendant was a local resident who\nwas convicted twice for criminal contempt based on two separate instances of\nobstructionist conduct in contravention of the district court’s orders requiring the\ndiscontinuance of racial segregation in the local high school. Id. at 687-88, 695.\n\n        The defendant in Bullock was found in criminal contempt for “inciting the\ncitizens of Clinton . . . in a speech he made on August 29, 1956, to violate the [August\n29, 1956] restraining order.” Id. at 688. Several months later, the defendant conspired\nwith others to “congregate [] in a threatening manner along the route to the” school in\norder to intimidate the students, a direct violation of the district court’s September 6,\n1956 permanent injunction. Id. at 687. In finding no double jeopardy violation, we held\nthat:\n\n        Under the Constitution [defendant] is not immune from prosecution for\n        contempt of court committed in November and December, 1956, simply\n        because he was found guilty of a similar contempt which occurred in\n        August, 1956. Successive and separate contempts are punishable as\n        separate offenses.\n\nId. at 695. Moreover, the defendant in Bullock was not sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment for the first contempt. See id.\n\n        Bullock therefore has nothing to do with the type of contemptuous conduct at\nissue herein and in Yates. That the reasoning in Bullock provides no assistance with\nrespect to resolving the double jeopardy question present here is demonstrated by the\nBullock court’s failure to cite to Yates altogether in reaching its conclusion. Bullock is\nunlike the circumstances herein and in Yates; both involve the repeated and identical\nrefusal to testify to the same subject-matter in a case. As such, Bullock is simply\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                        Page 17\n\n\ninapplicable and cannot be relied upon in resolving Farah’s double jeopardy claim\nrelating to Count Two.\n\n       Additionally, the manner in which this conviction came about is somewhat\ntroubling. An argument can be made that there was no reason to conduct the deposition,\nother than to tack on additional punishment because the requirements of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3144 had not been satisfied before the district judge ordered the deposition in August\nof 2012:\n\n       No material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with\n       any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately\n       be secured by deposition, and if further detention is not necessary to\n       prevent a failure of justice.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3144.\n\n       In order for the district court to order a deposition of a material witness pursuant\nto 18 U.S.C. § 3144, either the Government or Farah was required to demonstrate the\n“testimony can adequately be secured by deposition, and that further detention is not\nnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. Upon such a showing the district court must\norder his deposition and prompt release.” Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, 973 F.2d 411, 413 (5th\nCir. 1992); see also United States v. Fuentes-Galindo, 929 F.2d 1507, 1510 (9th Cir.\n1991) (concluding a standing order permitting a magistrate judge to order a § 3144\ndeposition without the requirement that either the government or the defendant first file\n“an affidavit establishing that the circumstances contemplated in that section are present”\nto be procedurally improper).\n\n       Here, there had been no demonstration that Farah’s testimony could be\nadequately secured by deposition during the August 2012 hearing. Rather, Farah stated\nhe would not testify at any of the upcoming trials. As such, the Government did not\nestablish that Farah’s testimony could be “adequately secured,” because he stated that he\nwould never provide testimony for the prosecution in the Somali gang case. To tack on\nmore punishment for Farah’s refusal to testify for the prosecution in the Adan trials at a\ncompelled 18 U.S.C. § 1344 deposition apparently ordered outside of the statutory\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 18\n\n\nrequirements also appears to implicate due process considerations, notwithstanding\ndouble jeopardy.\n\n       Next, we must consider whether the additional charge of obstruction or attempt\nto obstruct the enforcement of the child trafficking laws under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d)\nmakes this case fall outside of the parameters of the double jeopardy clause. The\nGovernment maintains that because Farah was charged with violating Count Three,\ndouble jeopardy is not implicated because his prior conviction did not include a\nconviction for obstruction of the enforcement of the child sex trafficking laws.\nConversely, Farah argues that his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) cannot stand\nbecause its violation required proof by the Government that Farah had also violated\n18 U.S.C. § 401(3).\n\n        While Yates and its progeny were appropriate for determining whether double\njeopardy was violated based on impermissible multiple contempts, we must return to\nBlockburger and its progeny and employ the “same elements” test to determine whether\nFarah has twice been put in jeopardy where he was convicted of obstructing, or\nattempting to obstruct the enforcement of § 1591(a) after having previously been\nconvicted of criminal contempt.\n\n        There is a strong argument that double jeopardy is not implicated and supporting\nauthority exists for this proposition. In United States v. Laurins, 857 F.2d 529 (9th Cir.\n1988), the defendant argued during direct appeal that his convictions for obstruction of\njustice, 18 U.S.C. § 1505, and for aiding, abetting, and causing contempt of court in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), “were improper as double punishment for a single act.”\nId. at 542. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument concluding:\n\n       Although the same conduct was the basis for the two counts, proof of\n       contempt of court does not necessarily include proof of obstruction of\n       justice. As discussed above, 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) punishes the\n       disobedience of a court order; 18 U.S.C. § 1505 punishes corrupt\n       obstruction of a pending agency proceeding. Without actually disobeying\n       a court order, an individual could obstruct an IRS investigation by hiding\n       documents sought by the agency. It would also be possible to disobey a\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                        Page 19\n\n\n        court order without obstructing an investigation by a department or\n        agency of the United States, where no such investigation was pending.\n        Nor is there any evidence in either statute that Congress did not intend to\n        allow separate punishments. The consecutive sentences were proper.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted). Here, Farah’s conviction for obstructing or attempting\nto obstruct the child sex trafficking laws requires proof that he (1) knew of the Adan case\nand (2) obstructed or attempted to obstruct the enforcement or the prosecution of the\nchild sex trafficking laws by refusing to testify at a deposition intended for use during\nthe ongoing Adan matter. His contempt conviction required only proof that he disobeyed\na judge’s court order to testify.\n\n        However, Farah argues his double jeopardy rights were violated because the\nGovernment was required to prove all of the elements of the contempt charge under\n18 U.S.C. § 401(3) in order to prove the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d). While not\nciting to the decision, it appears Farah is relying on Brown, 432 U.S. at 166 n.6, wherein\nthe Supreme Court held:\n\n        The Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether\n        successive prosecutions impermissibly involve the same offense. Even\n        if two offenses are sufficiently different to permit the imposition of\n        consecutive sentences, successive prosecutions will be barred in some\n        circumstances where the second prosecution requires the relitigation of\n        factual issues already resolved by the first.\n\nId. at 166 n.6. This argument can be rejected because the circumstances here are unlike\nthose discussed in Brown. See id.\n\n        Yet, Farah’s argument is not wholly without merit where the facts giving rise to\nFarah’s convictions under both statutes are “interrelated,” as noted by the district judge\nat the August 2012 hearing, thus it could be argued that the Government has violated the\nrule announced in Yates, as well as the principles discussed in Brown by obtaining\nmultiple punishments for the same refusal “carved out” in April of 2012 by charging the\nadditional violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), which could have been tried in June of 2012.\nHowever, neither Yates nor Brown appears applicable to the charges brought under\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                   Page 20\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) for purposes of double jeopardy analysis. Moreover, there is no\nauthority for the proposition that Yates intended to bar the Government from exercising\nits right to enforce the laws and punish those who obstruct its endeavors in this regard\nseparate and apart from its right to seek punishment for contemptuous conduct directed\nat the court. As such, we conclude that Farah’s double jeopardy rights have not been\nviolated with respect to his conviction for attempting to obstruct the enforcement of the\nchild sex trafficking laws in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d).8\n\n         Because Farah can only demonstrate the violation of his double jeopardy rights\nin part, we vacate his conviction only as to Count Two.\n\n                                                   B.\n\n         Farah argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss Count\nThree as defective because, as a mater of law, the government did not allege and could\nnot prove the required intent. The Government counters that the requisite mental state\nfor a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) is “knowingly,” and since this mental state is\nalleged in the indictment and the evidence at trial established same, Farah’s argument is\nwithout merit.\n\n         Whether an indictment adequately charges an offense is a question of law subject\nto de novo review. United States v. Hill, 167 F.3d 1055, 1065 (6th Cir. 1999). The\nNotice Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant’s right to be informed of\nthe charges against him. United States v. Superior Growers Supply, Inc., 982 F.2d 173,\n176 (6th Cir. 1992). An indictment is constitutionally adequate “if it, first, contains the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge which he\nmust defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future\nprosecutions for the same offense.” Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.\nCt. 2887, 41 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1974); see also United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 388\n\n\n         8\n          W hile we are troubled by the procedure within which the deposition was ordered, this is not\nenough to implicate double jeopardy with respect to Count Three, particularly where, as here, the statutes\nseek to punish different contemptuous conduct-directed at court business or directed at obstruction to the\nenforcement of the child sex trafficking laws. See Laurins, 857 F.2d at 542.\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                         Page 21\n\n\n(6th Cir. 1997). Under this standard, “[a]n indictment will usually be sufficient if it\nstates the offense using the words of the statue itself, as long as the statute fully and\nunambiguously states all the elements of the offense.” Superior Growers Supply,\n982 F.2d at 176.\n\n        Title 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) states: “Whoever obstructs, attempts to obstruct, or in\nany way interferes with or prevents the enforcement of [15 U.S.C. § 1591(a)] shall be\nfined under this title, imprisoned for a term not to exceed 20 years, or both.” Farah\nargues that 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) requires that he act with a “corrupt” mental state and the\nindictment merely alleged “knowing conduct.” However, Farah fails to convince the\nCourt, without any supporting authority, that Congress intended the omnibus provision\nof 18 U.S.C § 1503 to apply to 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), as he suggests. Moreover, Farah\nignores authority standing for the proposition that where a statute is silent as to the mens\nrea requirement, the appropriate standard is whether the act is done “knowingly.”\nStaples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 619, 114 S. Ct. 1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994);\nUnited States v. DeAndino, 958 F.2d 146, 148 (6th Cir. 1992).\n\n        Here, the statute is silent, thus knowingly is the appropriate mens rea. Staples,\n511 U.S. at 619; DeAndino, 958 F.2d at 148. The indictment charged that Farah\n“knowingly did attempt to obstruct . . . the enforcement of Title 18 United States Code,\nSection 1591(a)” on September 12, 2012. Farah was fully aware of the Adan matter;\nhaving provided testimony to the grand jury on three separate occasions, found in civil,\nas well as criminal contempt. Farah knew of the Government’s endeavors with respect\nto the Adan matter, and knew that refusing to testify would impede the prosecution of the\ncase and the enforcement of the child sex trafficking laws. See Pettibone v. United\nStates, 148 U.S. 197, 208, 13 S. Ct. 542, 37 L. Ed. 419 (1893) (holding under\npredecessor statute that “a person is not sufficiently charged with obstructing or\nimpeding the due administration of justice in a court unless it appears that he knew or\nhad notice that justice was being administered in such court.”). Farah was fully aware\nthat he was a material witness and the Government’s ability to establish its conspiracy\ncase, which included 30 defendants, many of whom most likely can only be identified\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 22\n\n\nby voice with the help of Farah’s testimony, was dependent on his cooperation. As such,\nFarah’s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated because the indictment fully informed\nhim of the charges.\n\n       Farah further asserts that § 1591(d) is constitutionally void for vagueness, both\nin general and as applied to him. “The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that [th]e\nstatute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can\nunderstand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary\nand discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Bazazpour, 690 F.3d 796, 800 (6th\nCir. 2012) (internal quotations omitted). This argument likewise lacks merit. Farah’s\nconduct in refusing to testify for the prosecution surely falls within the ambit of\n18 U.S.C. § 1591(d). He knew that his conduct would interfere with the prosecution of\nthe Adan defendants and the Government’s enforcement of the child sex trafficking laws.\nFarah has not demonstrated entitlement to relief on his second and third claims for relief.\n\n                                            C.\n\n        Additionally, Farah maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion\nto compel the Government to produce evidence related to his fear of retaliation.\nSpecifically, Farah requested evidence related to gang violence and witness retaliation\nand claims that this evidence might have enabled him to alter the proof in his favor. A\ndistrict court’s application of the rules of criminal procedure are reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion. United States v. Semrau, 693 F.3d 510, 529 (6th Cir. 2012). None of Farah’s\narguments have merit. Rule 16(a)(1)(E)(iii) is inapplicable because Farah could not\nestablish the items sought belonged to the Government. Moreover, Farah curiously\nadmits he had knowledge of some of the evidence, undermining his claim that Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963) has been violated.\nSee Spirko v. Mitchell, 368 F.3d 603, 610 (6th Cir. 2004) (“[W]here the defendant was\naware of the essential facts that would enable him to take advantage of the exculpatory\nevidence, the government’s failure to disclose it d[oes] not violate Brady.”)\n\fNo. 13-6147           United States v. Farah                                      Page 23\n\n\n       In any event, we conclude the district court correctly determined that Farah was\nnot entitled to a duress defense. Whether a defendant has established a prima facie case\nof duress is a question of law and on appellate review is reviewed de novo. See United\nStates v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 464, 468 (6th Cir. 2005) (in order to proffer duress defense,\na defendant must proffer some evidence of “an unlawful and present, imminent, and\nimpending threat of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death\nor serious bodily injury.”) Here, there is an absence of record evidence demonstrating\nsatisfaction of the elements for a duress defense. Nor would the evidence undermine the\n“knowing” mens rea element of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) requiring proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that Farah knew his conduct would interfere with the enforcement of the child sex\ntrafficking laws. Because Farah was not entitled to a duress defense, his argument that\nthe district judge erred in excluding expert testimony on street gang behavior requires no\nfurther discussion.\n\n       Farah is not entitled to relief on claims IV through VI.\n\n                                               D.\n\n       In his final claim of error, Farah argues that the district court erroneously failed\nto correct prosecutor misstatements of law and fact made during closing arguments\nwhich denied him due process. We ordinarily review claims of prosecutor misconduct\nde novo. United States v. Lawrence, 735 F.3d 385, 482 (6th Cir. 2013). Here, we\nconclude that any purported misstatement of law did not “so infect[] the trial with\nunfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.” Darden v.\nWainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986). To satisfy this\nstandard, the conduct must be both improper and flagrant. Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F. 3d\n392, 412 (6th Cir. 2006). This court considers four factors to determine whether a\nprosecutor’s conduct is flagrant. Johnson v. Bell, 525 F.3d 466, 482 (6th Cir. 2008).\nSpecifically, the factors include: “(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor\ntended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were\nisolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made;\n(4) the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.” Id.\n\fNo. 13-6147          United States v. Farah                                         Page 24\n\n\n        During closing arguments, the Government argued that Farah’s conduct deprived\nthe jury, the court and the parties of material information. Specifically, at the conclusion\nof his remarks concerning the proof required to establish guilt as to Count Three, the\nprosecutor argued:\n\n                And in the United States defendants have the right to be\n        confronted by the witnesses against them associated with the actual\n        information.\n                So does it obstruct justice if witnesses, such as defendant in this\n        particular case, refuse to come in to testify as to the information that they\n        have? The material information that they have associated with criminal\n        acts of others.\n                The answer is yes, it does. It deprives a jury, it deprives the\n        Court, it deprives the parties of that material information, to make a\n        decision as to those offenses.\n\nDefense counsel, arguing outside of the presence of the jury:\n\n        Judge, he just stated the reason – why this jury needs to know what a\n        deposition pursuant to 3144 is all about. Because now he’s saying that\n        his case has been obstructed because the defendants have been deprived\n        of his testimony, when in fact the defendants were not deprived of his\n        testimony because the trial has not yet occurred. He can still be called as\n        a witness. All that’s happened is Mr. Farah deprived himself of the\n        opportunity to be released by providing the testimony pursuant to 3144.\n\nThe district judge admonished counsel stating: “Don’t go down that line any more.\nWe’re going to finish this, see what the jury does, and then see if we need to have post-\ntrial motions.”\n\n        Here, even if the prosecutor’s arguments were improper, they were not flagrant.\nFarah’s claim relies on a misunderstanding of the district judge’s decision to vacate his\nconviction on Count One. The district judge vacated his conviction on Count One\nbecause there had been no evidence at trial that Farah’s conduct resulted in the\ninterference with court business. While Farah’s persistent refusal to testify as a material\nwitness may not have interfered with court business, that does not necessarily lead to the\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 25\n\n\nconclusion that his conduct did not interfere with the Government’s enforcement of\n18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), as correctly concluded by the trial court.\n\n       Moreover, taken in the context of the entire trial, we cannot conclude that the\nstatements so infected Farah’s trial with unfairness as to deprive him of due process. The\nprosecutor’s statements were isolated, occurring only twice during the entirety of his\nclosing argument. Additionally, the record demonstrates that the prosecutor was not\ndeliberately trying to mislead the jury as just prior to discussing the elements required\nto prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), he stated: “And, again, if the Court charges\nyou something different than what the United States says, be sure to follow the Court’s\ninstruction. This is what the United States anticipates the elements for the offenses will\nbe. Okay?” (Id. at 222.) Lastly, the evidence against Farah was sufficient to support his\nconviction on Count Three based on the testimony that he had refused to testify at a\ndeposition for a prosecution directed at enforcing the laws of the United States.\n\n       Farah is likewise not entitled to relief on claim VII.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       Based on the foregoing considerations, we AFFIRM Farah’s judgment of\nconviction on Count Three, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), and VACATE Farah’s judgment of\nconviction on Count Two, 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), and REMAND this matter for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v.

Long ago, the Supreme Court recognized that “no [person] can be twice lawfully\npunished for the same offence . . . when a second punishment is proposed in the same\ncourt, on the same facts, for the same statutory offence.” Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163,\n168 (1873). “Successive and separate contempts,” however, “are punishable as separate\noffenses.” Bullock v. United States, 265 F.2d 683, 695 (6th Cir. 1959). In 2010, the\ngovernment indicted thirty members of the Somali Outlaws on sex-trafficking charges.\nIn 2012, Abdullahi Farah refused to testify at the trial of nine of the Somali Outlaws\nnamed in the indictment. For his refusal, Farah was found guilty of criminal contempt,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), and given a sentence of four months of imprisonment.\nA year later, Farah refused to testify again, this time at a deposition to be used in\ndifferent trials against the other twenty-one defendants. Once again, the government\nindicted Farah for criminal contempt under § 401(3); he was found guilty and sentenced\nto prison. In my view, these two convictions punished two different acts and did not\noffend the Fifth Amendment. Because the lead opinion sees things differently, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III.A.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       On April 16, 2012, the government was in the middle of trying nine of the Somali\nOutlaws. See R. 2325 (Minute Entry) (Page ID #12374) (Case No. 3:10-cr-260). As part\nof its case against those nine defendants, the government wanted to call Farah as a\nwitness to “identif[y] particular defendants” and “identif[y] particular defendants’\nvoices.” R. 23 at 6:20–22 (Apr. 18, 2012 Hr’g Tr.) (Page ID #74) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85).\nDespite being held as a material witness “[d]uring the course of this trial at this time,”\nid. at 7:17–18 (Page ID #75) (emphasis added), Farah refused to testify, and in response,\nthe government filed a motion to compel his testimony in the ongoing trial. See R. 2 at\n\fNo. 13-6147           United States v. Farah                                                 Page 27\n\n\n1 (Mot. to Compel) (Page ID #2) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). Two days later, the district\ncourt held a hearing, found Farah in civil contempt for “refus[ing] to testify in the Adan\ncase,” and explained that “[i]f [Farah] [did not] change [his] mind, [he would] be held\nin custody pending the duration of the Adan trial.” R. 23 at 17:25, 18:6–8 (Apr. 18, 2012\nHr’g Tr.) (Page ID #85, 86) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). The district court further stated that\nif Farah failed to “testify by the end of the Adan trial, [it] intend[ed] to hold [him] in\ncriminal contempt.” Id. at 18:12–13 (Page ID #86). On April 25, 2012, the government\nfiled a notice with the district court that “it closed its proof” in the trial of the first nine\nSomali Outlaws.1 R. 7 at 1 (Notice Re: Material Witness) (Page ID #15) (Case No. 3:12-\ncr-85). On June 7, 2012, the district court held a bench trial and convicted Farah of\ncriminal contempt in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3). R. 34 at 9 (D. Ct. Op.) (Page ID\n#159) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). The district court then sentenced Farah to four months of\nimprisonment. R. 39 at 2 (D. Ct. J.) (Page ID #178) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85).\n\n        On July 24, 2012, Farah filed a “Motion for Review of Detention Order,” arguing\nin part that 18 U.S.C. § 3144 (the material-witness statute) does not permit the continued\ndetention of a purported material witness if “‘the testimony of such witness can\nadequately be secured by deposition.”’ R. 41 at 7–8 (Mot. for Review) (Page ID\n#192–93) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3144). On August 23, 2012, the\ndistrict court granted this motion in part, ordering that a “deposition shall occur before\nFarah’s sentence for criminal contempt expires in approximately October[] 2012.” R.\n48 at 3 (D. Ct. Dep. Order) (Page ID #291) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85).\n\n        The district court scheduled Farah’s deposition for September 12, 2012. Once\nagain, Farah refused to testify, and the government filed a motion for Farah to be held\nin civil contempt. R. 73 at 1 (Gov’t Contempt Mot.) (Page ID #471) (Case No. 3:12-cr-\n85). The district court decided that\n\n        holding Mr. Farah in civil contempt at this stage of the proceedings is not\n        appropriate. The Court ordered the deposition of Mr. Farah in order to\n        secure his testimony and eliminate the need for his appearance as a\n        1\n         Ultimately, six of the defendants in this trial were acquitted of all charges; the other three\ndefendants were convicted of lesser-included offenses.\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v.

Mr. Farah’s refusal to testify at\n       the deposition is tantamount to refusing to testify at each of the upcoming\n       trials. Therefore, Mr. Farah no longer needs an opportunity to purge\n       himself of the contempt . . . .\n\nR. 80 at 5 (D. Ct. 9/20/12 Order) (Page ID #566) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). If the\ngovernment wished to punish Farah for his continued refusal, the district court suggested\nthat the government “seek to charge Mr. Farah with criminal contempt” or “seek to have\nthe grand jury issue an indictment for obstruction of justice.” Id.\n\n       On October 3, 2012, the government followed this advice and secured an\nindictment, which charged [Farah] with violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), among other\nstatutes, for “refusing to testify in the deposition held September 12, 2012” in\ncontravention of the district court’s order. R. 1 at 2 (Indictment) (Page ID #2) (Case No.\n3:12-cr-196). On April 17, 2013, after a trial, the jury convicted Farah of violating\n§ 401(3).\n\n                                            II.\n\n       On appeal, Farah argues that this second conviction for violating 18 U.S.C.\n§ 401(3) runs afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The majority agrees, holding that\n“Farah’s refusal to testify was carved out in April of 2012 and his subsequent refusals\n‘fell within the limits drawn’ at the April 18, 2012 hearing and ‘only one contempt is\nshown on the facts of this case.’” Majority Op. at 13 (quoting Yates v. United States,\n355 U.S. 66, 74 (1957). Certainly, Yates is the logical starting point; however, my\nunderstanding of that case and its progeny leads me to the opposite conclusion regarding\nFarah’s double-jeopardy claim.\n\n       In Yates, a defendant—Oleta O’Connor Yates—refused to answer eleven\nquestions over two days of one trial, and for these eleven refusals, she was convicted on\neleven charges of criminal contempt. Id. at 72. The Supreme Court overturned ten of\nthe convictions, holding that Yates’s refusal to testify during one proceeding constituted\na single, continuing contempt. Id. at 74. By overturning all but one of the convictions,\nthe Supreme Court made “clear that the prosecution cannot multiply contempts by\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                           Page 29\n\n\nrepeated questioning on the same subject of inquiry within which a recalcitrant witness\nalready has refused answers.” Id. at 73. After all, a witness could refuse to testify at a\nproceeding entirely and would be guilty of only one contempt. Id. It would make little\nsense to subject “a witness willing to testify freely as to all areas of investigation but one\n. . . to more numerous charges of contempt than a witness unwilling to give any\ntestimony at all.” Id. Under Yates, therefore, a witness can “carve[] out an area of\nrefusal” and decline to answer any questions within the boundaries of her carve out, and\nthe government can bring only one criminal-contempt charge for refusing to testify at\nthat proceeding. Id.\n\n        This reading of Yates, limited as it is to a witness’s refusal to testify during a\nsingle proceeding, is logical and uncontroversial. Courts across the country share this\nview. See, e.g., United States v. Lach, 874 F.2d 1543, 1549 (11th Cir. 1989) (“Yates . . .\nstands only for the proposition that repeated or serial refusals to answer identical or\nsimilar questions in a single proceeding may not be used to establish multiple, separate\noffenses for what is, in essence, a single, continuing contempt.”); Baker v. Eisenstadt,\n456 F.2d 382, 385 (1st Cir. 1972) (vacating multiple contempt convictions when\ndefendant refused to answer forty-three questions in a single hearing); United States v.\nOrman, 207 F.2d 148, 160 (3d Cir. 1953) (vacating multiple contempt convictions when\na defendant refused to answer multiple questions in a single hearing); United States v.\nCostello, 198 F.2d 200, 204 (2d Cir. 1952) (A. Hand, J.) (vacating multiple contempt\nconvictions for refusing to answer multiple, related questions during a single hearing);\nPeople ex rel. Amarante v. McDonnell, 100 N.Y.S.2d 463, 467 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1950)\n(vacating multiple contempt convictions for refusing to answer seven questions before\na single grand jury).\n\n        Yates, however, does not stand for the proposition that a witness may refuse to\ntestify at two separate proceedings, against different defendants, and then have that\nrefusal count as a single, continuing contempt. In fact, our sister circuits stand firmly\nagainst this understanding. In United States v. Coachman, 752 F.3d 685 (D.C. Cir.\n1985), “[witnesses] were twice held in criminal contempt, first when they refused to\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                         Page 30\n\n\ntestify during a grand jury investigation, and again when they refused to testify at a trial\nemanating therefrom.” Id. at 687. The D.C. Circuit “conclude[d] that a witness [was]\ncontemptuous in both operations [by defying] governmental authority in each of those\nseparate manifestations, and [wa]s guilty of separate contempts.” Id. at 691. In In re\nBoyden, 675 F.2d 643 (5th Cir. 1982), a witness refused to testify at three separate trials\nagainst three separate defendants allegedly involved in a single drug-smuggling\nconspiracy. Id. at 644. The Fifth Circuit held that the witness committed three separate\noffenses because “[i]n each case that Boyden was called to testify, the government had\nto prove a separate offense [against the smugglers]. His testimony would overlap only\nbecause of the cases’ common origin.” Id. Likewise, in United States ex rel. Ushkowitz\nv. McCloskey, 359 F.2d 788 (2d Cir. 1966), a witness was called to testify before a grand\njury; he refused, was convicted of criminal contempt, and served his sentence. Id. at 789.\nOnce the witness finished his first sentence, the government called him to testify before\nthe same grand jury again, and the court upheld another criminal-contempt conviction.\nId. This cycle repeated again, and the Second Circuit upheld a third conviction because\nalthough “[t]he conduct for which the sentences were imposed was similar conduct, . . it\nwas engaged in on three occasions separated from each other by appreciable periods of\ntime.” Id.\n\n        In my view, the record indicates that Farah defied two separate district-court\norders by refusing to testify at two separate proceedings and, thus, committed two\nseparate contempts. In April 2012, the district court ordered Farah to testify at “the Adan\ntrial” involving nine of the Somali Outlaws defendants. R. 23 at 18:6–8 (Apr. 18, 2012\nHr’g Tr.) (Page ID #86) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). In September 2012, the district court\nordered Farah to testify at a deposition to be used in the four other Adan trials, involving\nthe twenty-one other defendants. The subject matter of Farah’s testimony might have\nbeen similar at both proceedings, but, as in Boyden, “[h]is testimony would overlap only\nbecause of the cases’ common origin.” 675 F.3d at 644. In each case, he would be asked\nto testify to the particular defendants’ identity, actions, and voices. See R. 23 at 6:20–22\n(Apr. 18, 2012 Hr’g Tr.) (Page ID #74) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). Moreover, like the\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                         Page 31\n\n\ndefendant in Coachman, Farah defied “governmental authority in [two] separate\nmanifestations,” 752 F.3d at 691, and Farah refused to testify “on [two] occasions\nseparated from each other by [an] appreciable period[] of time,” McCloskey, 359 F.2d\nat 789. As a result, I see very little in common between Farah’s case and Yates.\n\n        For me, the most analogous binding precedent is Bullock v. United States,\n265 F.2d 683 (6th Cir. 1959), a case that the majority dismisses as “distinguishable on\nthe facts.” Majority Op. at 16. In Bullock, the district court had entered a preliminary\ninjunction, prohibiting individuals from interfering with the desegregation of the local\nschools. 265 F.2d at 687. In late August 1956, the defendant—Frederick John\nKasper—“threatened to have the principal of the school ousted” if he allowed\nintegration, and Kasper “took other steps aimed at . . . restor[ing] segregation in the high\nschool . . . .” Id. For this behavior, he was found guilty of criminal contempt. Id. at 688.\nA few months later, Kasper returned to his despicable ways, encouraging others to block\nthe entry of African-American students to the high school and to beat the minister\nescorting the children to the schoolhouse door. Id. at 687. Shortly thereafter, the federal\ngovernment brought various charges against Kasper and others, including a second\ncriminal-contempt charge for Kasper. The jury convicted Kasper of criminal contempt,\nand he challenged this conviction on double-jeopardy grounds. We bluntly stated:\n“Under the Constitution Kasper is not immune from prosecution for contempt of court\ncommitted in November and December, 1956, simply because he was found guilty of a\nsimilar contempt which occurred in August, 1956.” Id. at 695. The same should be said\nhere. Farah’s conviction for refusing to testify at a trial in April 2012 involving certain\ndefendants does not, in my view, render him immune from a second prosecution for\ndefying a court’s order to testify at a deposition in September 2012 to be used in trials\ninvolving a different set of defendants.\n\n        Importantly, I do not believe that that the government could call Farah as a\nwitness at the trial of one of those twenty-one other defendants and obtain a third\ncriminal-contempt conviction if Farah refused to testify. In refusing to testify at the\ndeposition, which would be used in the prosecution of the other twenty-one defendants,\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                      Page 32\n\n\nFarah has carved out his zone of silence with regard to the prosecution of those\ndefendants. He has suffered the penalty for that silence. Calling Farah to testify at a\nsubsequent proceeding in the same prosecution would be hardly different than asking\nhim multiple questions regarding a certain subject in a single proceeding, a practice\nprohibited by Yates. The key difference between the second conviction in this case and\nthis hypothetical third conviction is that in September 2012 Farah had never been ordered\nto testify about that which he refused to testify. If the government called Farah to testify\nin the actual trial of one of the twenty-one defendants who were the subject of the\ndeposition, that would no longer be true—the government would be seeking a\nsubsequent conviction for a continuing refusal to testify about a subject to which Farah\nhad already been ordered to testify.2\n\n         Moreover, the text of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) makes this distinction clearer. A person\nmust “disobe[y] or resist[] [a court’s] lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or\ncommand” to violate § 401(3). In the first order, the court compelled Farah to testify\nregarding nine defendants and their crimes. When faced with this order to testify at those\ndefendants’ trial, Farah could not defy the order by refusing to testify to about twenty-one\nother people under indictment and their crimes. In each case, the government needed\ndifferent information, and therefore, two orders were needed. Whether Farah made his\nintent to defy the district court’s future orders known in advance is beside the point\nbecause there was no second violation of the statute until he actually defied the second\norder. Therefore, Farah’s refusals are two separate criminal actions.\n\n         Finally, it should be noted that in these types of cases, such “contumacious\nrefusal[s] to answer not only frustrate[] the inquiry but can destroy a prosecution,” as\nmay have happened in the first trial. United States v. Wilson, 421 U.S. 309, 316 (1975).\n“Here it was a prosecution; the same kind of contumacious conduct could, in another\nsetting, destroy a defendant’s ability to establish a case.” Id. Given the evidence in the\n         2\n           In the abstract, this rule may allow the government to break its prosecutions into multiple trials\nin order to obtain multiple contempt convictions. As a practical matter, I doubt that it would be in the\ngovernment’s interest to do so, and more importantly, there would likely be serious due-process concerns\nif there were evidence that the government was manipulating its prosecution of cases merely to pile on\ncontempt charges against a potential witness. See Boyden, 675 F.2d at 644 (“There is no indication that\n[the witness] was called for the sole purpose of being bludgeoned with contempt penalties.”).\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 33\n\n\nrecord, it is clear to me that Farah frustrated the public’s right to every person’s evidence\non two separate occasions and placed himself in jeopardy of two separate charges. I see\nno double-jeopardy problem, and for this reason, I respectfully dissent from Part III.A\nof the majority opinion.\n\f",

Defendant Abdullahi Farah was\nconvicted after a two-day jury trial of violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), for willfully\ndisobeying an order requiring his testimony by deposition for use in a separate criminal\nprosecution and for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), which prohibits the obstruction, or\nthe attempt to obstruct the enforcement of §1591(a), a child sex trafficking statute.\nFarah’s conviction stems from his refusal to testify in the ongoing criminal prosecution\nof thirty gang members of Somalian descent charged in the United States District Court\nfor the Middle District of Tennessee with several conspiracies including sex trafficking\nof minors, interstate transportation of stolen goods and other offenses.1\n\n       Because we conclude Farah’s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3)\nviolates the Double Jeopardy Clause and the rule announced in Yates v.

We further find that none of Farah’s remaining claims challenging his\nconviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) have merit, thus his judgment of conviction\nas to that count is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           United States v. Abdifitah Adan, 3:10-260.\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                 Page 3\n\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       Farah has been a member of the Somali Outlaws gang for nearly a decade,\nalthough during the course of the proceedings below, he has since renounced his\nmembership and affiliation with the gang. In 2010, while detained in immigration\ncustody in Ramsey County, Minnesota,2 Farah was approached by the Government\nabout an incident occurring in Nashville. Farah ultimately agreed to offer his assistance\nwith respect to the Government’s investigation. Farah believed that in exchange for his\ncooperation he would receive immunity from prosecution, reversal of the revocation of\nhis work permit, help obtaining his citizenship and release from custody.\n\n       Farah was granted transactional immunity and testified before the grand jury on\nthree separate occasions. He also assisted with the identification of gang members and\nprovided reliable information concerning the locations of many of the Adan defendants\nat the time the Government filed the charges and brought the Adan defendants into\ncustody in the fall of 2010.\n\n       Farah claims that after the Adan indictment was filed, other gang members in the\ncommunity began to suspect that he was supplying information to the Government\nbecause he was not indicted. He claims he was assaulted twice during the latter half of\n2011. The first time he claims he was pistol whipped and beaten by four masked men\nnear his home. The men threatened to kill him and harm his family. While Farah was\nin constant contact with Government agents during this time, when questioned by an\nagent about a cut above his eye resulting from the purported assault, Farah claimed he\nobtained the injury while playing basketball. He also claims he was assaulted right\nbefore the Christmas holiday that same year.\n\n       The Adan case was severed into separate trials by the trial court, with the first\ntrial commencing in March of 2012. Farah was arrested on a material witness warrant\na month before the commencement of the trial. A detention hearing was held before a\n\n\n\n       2\n           Farah has several prior convictions and removal proceedings have been initiated.\n\fNo. 13-6147           United States v. Farah                                                 Page 4\n\n\nmagistrate judge who determined that there were no conditions or combination of\nconditions that could reasonably assure Farah’s appearance and ordered his detention as\na material witness in the Adan case. The district judge presiding over the Adan case\nrecused himself from all material witness proceedings dealing with Farah and a separate\ncase was opened.3\n\n        On April 18, 2012, Farah made his appearance before a district judge based on\nthe Government’s “motion for a hearing related to witness’s refusal to testify.” The\nGovernment indicated that it had reached the point in the Adan trial for Farah’s\ntestimony and his “anticipated testimony would relate to the sex trafficking of [the]\nindividual known as Jane Doe 2, as well as relating to information known about the\nventure, which is a requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) . . . [h]e would also have\nthe information about . . . identifying particular defendants’ voices. And that’s it in a\nnutshell, Your Honor, as to materiality.” Farah, who was represented by counsel at the\nhearing, informed the district judge that he refused to testify.\n\n        EXAMINATION BY THE COURT:\n        Q:       Mr. Farah, the government has filed a motion asking me to\n                 compel you to testify in the Adan case that is being tried before\n                 Judge Haynes down the hall. I first want to establish whether you\n                 are willing to testify in that case. Are you willing to testify in that\n                 case?\n        A.       No, Your Honor.\n\nFarah explained to the Court that he was refusing to testify because: “I was coercion and\nI was pressured to testify from the beginning. It wasn’t my choice. I was either\nthreatened to go to jail or be indicted upon the case or either testify.” Farah claimed the\nGovernment had lied to him and his safety was in jeopardy, however he failed to inform\nthe court that he was twice assaulted by gang members and his family had been\nthreatened in the preceding year.\n\n\n\n        3\n          The district judge recused himself because his son worked at the same law firm that Farah’s\ndefense counsel worked.\n\fNo. 13-6147             United States v. Farah                                                       Page 5\n\n\n         The district judge concluded that Farah failed to establish just cause for his\nrefusal to testify, ordered him to testify for the prosecution in the ongoing Adan trial, and\nfound him in civil contempt. He also ordered Farah’s detention for the remainder of the\ntrial unless Farah purged himself of the contempt by testifying. The next day, another\nhearing was held to determine whether Farah would testify, but Farah indicated that his\nposition had not changed. The district judge reserved consideration of the Government’s\noral request to find Farah in criminal contempt until the conclusion of the trial, and again\ninformed Farah that the civil contempt could be purged upon his decision to testify.\nUpon the conclusion of the trial in Adan,4 the district judge set a trial date for the\nGovernment’s motion to hold Farah in criminal contempt.\n\n         A June 2012 bench trial was held and Farah was found guilty of criminal\ncontempt. At the trial, Farah testified about the two assaults in 2011, however the\ndistrict judge had serious doubts about his credibility particularly in light of his conduct\njust prior to his arrest. The district judge concluded that:\n\n         [T]he Court clearly ordered the defendant to testify. It was an ongoing\n         trial. He was to be called as a witness on the day that we had the initial\n         hearing, the 18th of April. And the defendant was clearly ordered to\n         testify, and he refused. So he had the benefit of a clear and definite order,\n         and he knew of the order.\n\n         Sentencing was held on July 3, 2012. The district judge began by noting that the\nstatutory maximum for criminal contempt was six-months imprisonment, but ultimately\ndetermined the statutory maximum was “not called for” under the circumstances\nbecause:\n\n         [I]f Mr. Farah repeats his conduct of failing to testify in legal\n         proceedings, the Court wants to have the flexibility to impose a graduated\n         sentence, meaning for there to be additional possibility of more\n\n         4\n           The jury returned guilty verdicts as to 3 defendants and 6 defendants were acquitted. The district\njudge later vacated the convictions and granted new trials for the three convicted defendants. As of the\ndate of this opinion, no more trials have been held in this matter. The record reveals 3-6 trials will be held\nas to the remaining Adan defendants. A trial set for October of 2013 did not take place and there have\nbeen no further trials scheduled. Since the first trial, five defendants have entered guilty pleas to counts\nunrelated to the sex trafficking counts and received sentences ranging from time served to forty-eight-\nmonths imprisonment.\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                     Page 6\n\n\n         punishment if we are simply here in a few months doing this same\n         proceeding.\n\nFarah’s counsel lodged an objection to this portion of the district judge’s ruling:\n\n         [I]t appears the Court is at least considering the possibility that if Mr.\n         Farah was charged with and tried for an additional contempt charge for\n         refusing to testify, he could be again convicted. It is now and will be my\n         position that that would be double jeopardy. Mr. Farah has said he will\n         not testify against the gang members. And the fact that the government\n         has divided this case into multiple cases5 doesn’t change the fact that he\n         has committed one act of contempt and that is the only act of contempt.\n         He should not be held in multiple contempts because of the government’s\n         decision to bifurcate the trials. I am making that objection now because\n         I raised it earlier.\n\n         While Farah was serving his four month sentence, his attorney filed a motion for\nreview of the order detaining him as a material witness requesting that Farah be released\nafter the conclusion of his sentence for criminal contempt, or in early October 2012,\nbecause further detention at that point implicated constitutional considerations because\nnone of the remaining trials had been set in the Adan case. A hearing was held before\nthe district judge on August 23, 2012.\n\n         At the hearing, the district judge began by stating the procedural posture of the\ncase:\n\n         Farah[] has filed a motion for the review of the detention order of the\n         magistrate judge, . . . Docket Number 19 entered on May 16, 2012. It in\n         turn relies on the detention order in Case Number 12-2029. And just to\n         try to keep things clear, the detention order in the Case 3:12-85 was a\n         detention for Mr. Farah as a defendant in the criminal case dealing with\n         criminal contempt. But that order relies on the reasons stated for\n         detaining Mr. Farah in Case Number 12-2029 as a material witness. So\n         it is all interrelated.\n\n\n\n\n         5\n          The record is not clear as to whether the Government requested that the trial proceed in stages,\nor whether the district judge determined that multiple trials were necessary for court administrative\npurposes, or whether both desired to resolve the Adan prosecution in separate trials.\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                             Page 7\n\n\nDefense counsel argued that once Farah served the remaining term of his sentence for\ncriminal contempt, he should be released because continued confinement as a material\nwitness was unjust under the circumstances:\n\n       [O]nce he serves his remaining two months [he] will be arguably being\n       held in detention with no trial date set, no idea when trial dates will be\n       set, and no idea how many trials he will be asked to testify in, which\n       could potentially go on for years. This is all in light of the fact that he’s\n       already told this Court and is suffering the consequences of it that he will\n       not testify against the Somali gang, meaning he won’t be providing\n       testimony in any of those upcoming trials.\n\nThe district judge inquired if a deposition could be taken pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3144.\nDefense counsel responded that, while he raised the subject of a deposition in his motion,\nhe inartfully did so and meant to argue that such an endeavor would be futile because\nFarah would not change his stance regarding testifying in the Adan matter. The\nGovernment requested that Farah’s testimony by deposition be ordered by the court,\nhowever neither the Government nor the district judge addressed the requirements for\nordering a deposition pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3144. The district judge took the matter\nunder advisement and later granted the request in an August 23, 2012 summary order.\n\n       The deposition was held at the courthouse on September 12, 2012, and the Adan\ndefendants, and their counsel, were either present or waived their presence. At the\ndeposition, the Government began by stating the purpose of the deposition was for use\n“at trial in relation to the matter of United States v. Adan 3:10-00260.” The Government\nproceeded to ask Farah if he would answer questions regarding issues involved in the\nremaining trials for which the Government sought his testimony. Farah persisted in his\nrefusal and indicated he would not testify in any of the trials.6\n\n       After the deposition, the Government moved to hold Farah in civil contempt\nbased on his refusal to testify at the deposition.                 The district judge denied the\nGovernment’s motion, finding in relevant part:\n\n\n\n       6\n           Farah was not placed under oath prior to questioning.\n\fNo. 13-6147             United States v. Farah                                         Page 8\n\n\n        The Court concludes that holding Mr. Farah in civil contempt at this\n        stage of the proceedings is not appropriate. The Court ordered the\n        deposition of Mr. Farah in order to secure his testimony and eliminate the\n        need for his appearance as a witness at future trials in the Adan case. Mr.\n        Farah’s refusal to testify at the deposition is tantamount to refusing to\n        testify at each of the upcoming trials. Therefore, Mr. Farah no longer\n        needs an opportunity to purge himself of the contempt, as is contemplated\n        by the imposition of civil contempt. Instead, the Government may seek\n        to charge Mr. Farah with criminal contempt for his refusal to testify at the\n        deposition, or alternatively, may seek to have the grand jury issue an\n        indictment for obstruction of justice or other appropriate charges.\n\n        On October 3, 2012, the Government filed the three-count indictment giving rise\nto the instant action.7 Count One of the indictment charged Farah with violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 401(1) for “willfully and knowingly misbehav[ing] in the presence of the\n[district judge]. . . or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice in” both\nFarah [3:12-85] and the Adan actions by refusing to testify at the deposition. Count Two\ncharged Farah with “willfully and knowingly disobey[ing] and resist[ing]” the August\n2012 order issued in the cases of Farah [3:12-85] and Adan by refusing to testify.\nLastly, Farah was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), which punishes\ninterference with the enforcement of child sex trafficking laws.\n\n        The district judge presiding over Farah’s material witness and contempt\nproceedings entered an order of recusal because he was mentioned in the body of the\nindictment and the matter was assigned to a different district judge. Thereafter, Farah\nfiled a motion to dismiss arguing that the indictment violated the constitutional\nprohibition against double jeopardy, among other things. The district judge denied this\nmotion, as well as Farah’s motion to compel discovery related to Somali gangs and\nwitness retaliation and his motion to permit the use of an expert on street gang behavior.\nAt a pre-trial hearing, the district judge informed the parties that he would not permit\nFarah to present a duress defense at trial.\n\n\n\n\n        7\n            United States v. Abdullahi Farah, 3:12-00196.\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                           Page 9\n\n\n       The trial commenced on April 16, 2013. The Government introduced the August\n2012 order and the Notice of Deposition which stated that the purpose of the deposition\nwas for use in the Adan case. The parties stipulated to the introduction of evidence that\n“on or before September 12, 2012,” Farah had “material information relating to the\nenforcement of” 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1) & (a)(2), and 1594(c) and that on that same\ndate, the Government was “engaged in the enforcement” of federal laws including\n“violation of Title 18, USC, Sections 1512(b)(1), 1512(b)(2), 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(1), and\n1512(c)(2), including prosecution” in the Adan matter. The jury heard from two law\nenforcement officials who were present at the deposition, and both testified that Farah\nstated he would not provide testimony for any of the remaining Adan trials.\n\n       The jury found Farah guilty of all three counts charged in the indictment,\nhowever the district judge subsequently granted Farah’s motion for judgment of acquittal\nin part and set aside Farah’s conviction as to Count One. Farah was sentenced to a term\nof 15-months imprisonment for Counts Two and Three, to run concurrently. Farah’s\ntimely appeal followed.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       Farah argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and his\nconvictions should be vacated because the indictment violated the double jeopardy clause\nof the Fifth Amendment. His refusal to testify at the deposition was a continuation of\nhis conduct in April of 2012–conduct which forms the basis of his prior contempt\nconviction. He maintains that the Government seeks to transform his single act of\ncontempt into multiple acts of contempt to improperly impose additional punishment.\n\n       Conversely, the Government argues that the double jeopardy clause is not\nimplicated here because Farah’s first contempt was based upon his refusal to testify\nduring the first Adan trial, while the indictment at issue herein arose from his failure to\ncomply with a court order to provide deposition testimony after the conclusion of the\nfirst trial in Adan. Moreover, the instant action charges Farah with the additional crime\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 10\n\n\nof violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), a charge that was not the subject of the 2012 contempt\ntrial or resulting conviction.\n\n        Double jeopardy claims are questions of law that require de novo review.

In Rashad, a panel of this Court explained that:\n\n        The Blockburger test is designed to deal with the situation where closely\n        connected conduct results in multiple charges under separate statutes.\n        In a Blockburger case, the critical question is whether the multiple\n        charges in reality constitute the same offense. Thus, the Blockburger test\n        focuses on whether the statutory elements of the two crimes charged are\n        duplicative.\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                         Page 11\n\n\nRashad, 108 F.3d at 679 (emphasis supplied). The defendant in Rashad argued that his\nconviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine after an earlier conviction for\npossession and delivery of the same substance violated his rights under the double\njeopardy clause. Id. at 678. The arresting officers in Rashad discovered cocaine in both\nhis house and car. Id. at 679. The defendant’s first trial for possession with intent to\ndeliver involved the cocaine seized from his residence. Id. at 680. Roughly six months\nlater, he was tried for possession with intent to deliver in connection with the cocaine\nseized from his car. Id. The Rashad court concluded that the second prosecution\nviolated the defendant’s double jeopardy rights because the “possession of cocaine in his\nhome and in his automobile constituted a single transaction.” Id. at 680-81.\n\n        Farah argues that Rashad is similar to the facts of his case, however his reliance\nis misplaced. The holding in Rashad has been limited by subsequent decisions of this\nCourt. See United States v. Forman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764844\"><a href=\"/opinion/764844/united-states-v-theodore-s-forman/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1999); Murr v.

In Murr, we rejected the defendant’s argument that\nRashad compelled the conclusion that his double jeopardy rights had been violated when\nhe was prosecuted for narcotics offenses in the federal district court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Kentucky after pleading guilty to narcotics charges brought in the federal\ndistrict court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Murr, 200 F.3d at 901. In rejecting\nthe defendant’s argument, we noted that Rashad is “limited to its unique facts, in that\n‘the issue . . . was whether the defendant had committed one as opposed to two discrete\nviolations of the same statute, not whether the defendant was charged twice for the same\nviolation.’” Id. (quoting Forman, 180 F.3d at 769). As such, use of Rashad to resolve\ndouble jeopardy questions is limited “to circumstances such as were present in th[at]\ncase.” Id. Here, the facts of Farah’s case are unlike those present in Rashad, thus its\napplication is inappropriate.\n\n        The Government argues that United States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437156\"><a href=\"/opinion/437156/united-states-v-marlon-louis-johnson-timothy-duane-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n1984) supports its contention, however the Government’s reliance on this case is\nmisplaced. The issue in Johnson concerned whether an individual could be confined for\ncivil contempt based on “anticipatory contempt” or refusal to testify at a future trial when\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 12\n\n\nno trial date had been set. Id. at 360. There was no anticipatory contempt here as Farah\nindicated in April of 2012 during the ongoing Adan proceedings that he would not\ntestify. Additionally, civil contempt is concerned with forcing the witness to purge\nhimself of the contempt, whereas criminal contempt is aimed at punishing the witness.\nJohnson likewise fails to provide the Court with any guidance.\n\n        The most appropriate authority to begin with is that of Yates v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105580\"><a href=\"/opinion/105580/yates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105580\"><a href=\"/opinion/105580/yates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On June 26, 1952, during the\nfirst day of the petitioner’s cross examination in her trial charging violation of the Smith\nAct, she refused to answer “four questions about the Communist membership of a\nnondefendant and of a codefendant who had rested his case.” Id. at 68. She stated that\nno matter the number of times she was asked “to identify a person as a communist, [she]\ncan’t bring [herself] to do it . . . .” Id. She was found guilty of civil contempt and\ncommitted to jail. Id. On the third day of trial, she again refused to answer eleven\nquestions asking her to identify members of the Communist party. Id. at 69. The trial\ncourt found her guilty of eleven separate criminal contempts. Id. In vacating all but the\nfirst of the contempt charges, the Supreme Court held:\n\n        Even though we assume the Government correct in its contention that the\n        11 questions in this case covered more than a single subject of inquiry,\n        it appears that every question fell within the area of refusal established by\n        the petitioner on the first day of her cross-examination . . . . Having once\n        carved out an area of refusal [on June 26, 1952], petitioner remained\n        within its boundaries in all her subsequent refusals.\n\nId. at 73-74. Farah also relies on Yates, and argues the Government is “attempting to\nmultiply contempts by repeated questioning on the same subject matter of inquiry within\nwhich Mr. Farah has already refused answers.”\n\n        Thus, based on the rule announced in Yates, at least with respect to Farah’s\nconviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), the appropriate question is whether Farah’s\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 13\n\n\ncriminal contempt for refusal to testify in April of 2012, and subsequent identical refusal\nand conviction constitute improper contempt multiplication in contravention of the\ndouble jeopardy clause. At the hearing in April of 2012, Farah indicated that he would\nnot testify for the prosecution in the “Adan case” when asked by the district judge on two\noccasions. As in Yates, Farah “had flatly refused on [April 18, 2012] to answer any\nquestions and had maintained such a position. . . . Having once carved out an area of\nrefusal, [Farah] remained within its boundaries in all h[is] subsequent refusals.” Yates,\n355 U.S. at 73-74. Farah’s refusal to testify was carved out in April of 2012 and his\nsubsequent refusals “fell within the limits drawn” at the April 18, 2012 hearing and “only\none contempt is shown on the facts of this case.” Id. at 74.\n\n       As such, Farah’s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) violates Yates.\nFarah’s 2013 conviction stems from his refusal in April of the previous year to testify in\nthe Adan case, conduct which he had already been charged and punished for in June of\n2012. Farah’s contempt, like the petitioner in Yates, was continuing and the Government\ncould not tack on multiple punishments. While the Adan case was separated into\ndifferent trials, Farah’s testimony concerned the same subject matter–evidence of the\ngang’s conspiratorial child sex trafficking activities. Just because a case has been\nsevered into separate trials does not provide the Government an opportunity to tack on\ncriminal contempts in this fashion. A defendant’s risk of re-incarceration and the\nnumber of criminal contempts for the same refusal to provide testimony on the same\nsubject conspiracies should not be controlled by the nature of trial practice and court\ndocketing considerations. The Government’s argument that the contempts involve\nseparate transactions is unpersuasive.\n\n       While Yates is clearly dispositive of the issue, it should be noted that Farah fails\nto elaborate on Yates and its progeny and the Government fails to address Yates\naltogether. The case law in this area is surprisingly sparse and the courts that have\naddressed this issue in similar contexts–although never quite factually on point with the\ncircumstances present here–are widely divergent concerning when the government has\nimproperly multiplied contempts in contravention of Yates or its reasoning. The cases\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 14\n\n\nthat are the strongest support for Farah include Baker v.

For instance,\nin Baker, the First Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the district court improperly\nmultiplied contempts against the petitioner for refusing to testify concerning allegations\nof judicial misconduct on the part of two judges of the Massachusetts Superior Court.\nId. at 384, 395. The Baker petitioner refused to testify on the subject inquiry and upon\nlater being re-called to the stand, again refused to testify. Id. at 385. Forty-five\nsubstantive questions were asked, and the petitioner refused to answer each question and\nwas held in contempt for each refusal. Id. In concluding the multiple contempts were\nimposed in error, the Baker court held:\n\n        We therefore conclude that petitioner’s contempt lay in refusing to testify\n        at all on the subject inquiry, that his communicated intent made it clear\n        at the outset that the authority of the Court was frontally challenged and\n        the seriousness of the offense fully delineated, and that the contempt\n        could not therefore be multiplied . . . by running through the entire list of\n        questions.\n\nId. at 393 (emphasis supplied); see also United States v. Orman, 207 F.2d at 160 (noting\nthat “where the separate questions . . . relate to but a single subject of inquiry, only one\npenalty for contempt may be imposed” and “[w]here the witness has refused to give any\ntestimony, a committee cannot multiply his contempt by continuing to ask him questions\neach time eliciting the same answer.”).\n\n        Farah clearly declined to testify concerning the Somali Outlaws’ sex trafficking\nof minors in the Adan case in April of 2012. The dissent’s reliance on the fact that the\nproceedings were “separate” is the improper focus and an improper application of Yates.\nThe fact that the proceedings were “separate” does not alter the fact that the proceedings\nboth dealt with the Adan indictment’s allegations relating to the gang’s conspiracy to\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"247799\"><a href=\"/opinion/247799/alonzo-bullock-william-a-brakebill-lawrence-j-brantley-clyde-a-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1959) is “the most\nanalogous binding precedent.” Bullock is distinguishable on the facts and therefore\nprovides no guidance to the Court. In Bullock, the defendant was a local resident who\nwas convicted twice for criminal contempt based on two separate instances of\nobstructionist conduct in contravention of the district court’s orders requiring the\ndiscontinuance of racial segregation in the local high school. Id. at 687-88, 695.\n\n        The defendant in Bullock was found in criminal contempt for “inciting the\ncitizens of Clinton . . . in a speech he made on August 29, 1956, to violate the [August\n29, 1956] restraining order.” Id. at 688. Several months later, the defendant conspired\nwith others to “congregate [] in a threatening manner along the route to the” school in\norder to intimidate the students, a direct violation of the district court’s September 6,\n1956 permanent injunction. Id. at 687. In finding no double jeopardy violation, we held\nthat:\n\n        Under the Constitution [defendant] is not immune from prosecution for\n        contempt of court committed in November and December, 1956, simply\n        because he was found guilty of a similar contempt which occurred in\n        August, 1956. Successive and separate contempts are punishable as\n        separate offenses.\n\nId. at 695. Moreover, the defendant in Bullock was not sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment for the first contempt. See id.\n\n        Bullock therefore has nothing to do with the type of contemptuous conduct at\nissue herein and in Yates. That the reasoning in Bullock provides no assistance with\nrespect to resolving the double jeopardy question present here is demonstrated by the\nBullock court’s failure to cite to Yates altogether in reaching its conclusion. Bullock is\nunlike the circumstances herein and in Yates; both involve the repeated and identical\nrefusal to testify to the same subject-matter in a case. As such, Bullock is simply\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                        Page 17\n\n\ninapplicable and cannot be relied upon in resolving Farah’s double jeopardy claim\nrelating to Count Two.\n\n       Additionally, the manner in which this conviction came about is somewhat\ntroubling. An argument can be made that there was no reason to conduct the deposition,\nother than to tack on additional punishment because the requirements of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3144 had not been satisfied before the district judge ordered the deposition in August\nof 2012:\n\n       No material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with\n       any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately\n       be secured by deposition, and if further detention is not necessary to\n       prevent a failure of justice.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3144.\n\n       In order for the district court to order a deposition of a material witness pursuant\nto 18 U.S.C. § 3144, either the Government or Farah was required to demonstrate the\n“testimony can adequately be secured by deposition, and that further detention is not\nnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. Upon such a showing the district court must\norder his deposition and prompt release.” Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589706\"><a href=\"/opinion/589706/j-jesus-faustino-aguilar-ayala-v-cecilio-ruiz-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (5th\nCir. 1992); see also United States v.

Rather, Farah stated\nhe would not testify at any of the upcoming trials. As such, the Government did not\nestablish that Farah’s testimony could be “adequately secured,” because he stated that he\nwould never provide testimony for the prosecution in the Somali gang case. To tack on\nmore punishment for Farah’s refusal to testify for the prosecution in the Adan trials at a\ncompelled 18 U.S.C. § 1344 deposition apparently ordered outside of the statutory\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 18\n\n\nrequirements also appears to implicate due process considerations, notwithstanding\ndouble jeopardy.\n\n       Next, we must consider whether the additional charge of obstruction or attempt\nto obstruct the enforcement of the child trafficking laws under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d)\nmakes this case fall outside of the parameters of the double jeopardy clause. The\nGovernment maintains that because Farah was charged with violating Count Three,\ndouble jeopardy is not implicated because his prior conviction did not include a\nconviction for obstruction of the enforcement of the child sex trafficking laws.\nConversely, Farah argues that his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) cannot stand\nbecause its violation required proof by the Government that Farah had also violated\n18 U.S.C. § 401(3).\n\n        While Yates and its progeny were appropriate for determining whether double\njeopardy was violated based on impermissible multiple contempts, we must return to\nBlockburger and its progeny and employ the “same elements” test to determine whether\nFarah has twice been put in jeopardy where he was convicted of obstructing, or\nattempting to obstruct the enforcement of § 1591(a) after having previously been\nconvicted of criminal contempt.\n\n        There is a strong argument that double jeopardy is not implicated and supporting\nauthority exists for this proposition. In United States v. Laurins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511836\"><a href=\"/opinion/511836/united-states-v-aleksandrs-v-laurins/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n1988), the defendant argued during direct appeal that his convictions for obstruction of\njustice, 18 U.S.C. § 1505, and for aiding, abetting, and causing contempt of court in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), “were improper as double punishment for a single act.”\nId. at 542. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument concluding:\n\n       Although the same conduct was the basis for the two counts, proof of\n       contempt of court does not necessarily include proof of obstruction of\n       justice. As discussed above, 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) punishes the\n       disobedience of a court order; 18 U.S.C. § 1505 punishes corrupt\n       obstruction of a pending agency proceeding. Without actually disobeying\n       a court order, an individual could obstruct an IRS investigation by hiding\n       documents sought by the agency. It would also be possible to disobey a\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                        Page 19\n\n\n        court order without obstructing an investigation by a department or\n        agency of the United States, where no such investigation was pending.\n        Nor is there any evidence in either statute that Congress did not intend to\n        allow separate punishments. The consecutive sentences were proper.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted). Here, Farah’s conviction for obstructing or attempting\nto obstruct the child sex trafficking laws requires proof that he (1) knew of the Adan case\nand (2) obstructed or attempted to obstruct the enforcement or the prosecution of the\nchild sex trafficking laws by refusing to testify at a deposition intended for use during\nthe ongoing Adan matter. His contempt conviction required only proof that he disobeyed\na judge’s court order to testify.\n\n        However, Farah argues his double jeopardy rights were violated because the\nGovernment was required to prove all of the elements of the contempt charge under\n18 U.S.C. § 401(3) in order to prove the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d). While not\nciting to the decision, it appears Farah is relying on Brown, 432 U.S. at 166 n.6, wherein\nthe Supreme Court held:\n\n        The Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether\n        successive prosecutions impermissibly involve the same offense. Even\n        if two offenses are sufficiently different to permit the imposition of\n        consecutive sentences, successive prosecutions will be barred in some\n        circumstances where the second prosecution requires the relitigation of\n        factual issues already resolved by the first.\n\nId. at 166 n.6. This argument can be rejected because the circumstances here are unlike\nthose discussed in Brown. See id.\n\n        Yet, Farah’s argument is not wholly without merit where the facts giving rise to\nFarah’s convictions under both statutes are “interrelated,” as noted by the district judge\nat the August 2012 hearing, thus it could be argued that the Government has violated the\nrule announced in Yates, as well as the principles discussed in Brown by obtaining\nmultiple punishments for the same refusal “carved out” in April of 2012 by charging the\nadditional violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), which could have been tried in June of 2012.\nHowever, neither Yates nor Brown appears applicable to the charges brought under\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                   Page 20\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) for purposes of double jeopardy analysis. Moreover, there is no\nauthority for the proposition that Yates intended to bar the Government from exercising\nits right to enforce the laws and punish those who obstruct its endeavors in this regard\nseparate and apart from its right to seek punishment for contemptuous conduct directed\nat the court. As such, we conclude that Farah’s double jeopardy rights have not been\nviolated with respect to his conviction for attempting to obstruct the enforcement of the\nchild sex trafficking laws in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d).8\n\n         Because Farah can only demonstrate the violation of his double jeopardy rights\nin part, we vacate his conviction only as to Count Two.\n\n                                                   B.\n\n         Farah argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss Count\nThree as defective because, as a mater of law, the government did not allege and could\nnot prove the required intent. The Government counters that the requisite mental state\nfor a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) is “knowingly,” and since this mental state is\nalleged in the indictment and the evidence at trial established same, Farah’s argument is\nwithout merit.\n\n         Whether an indictment adequately charges an offense is a question of law subject\nto de novo review.

Under this standard, “[a]n indictment will usually be sufficient if it\nstates the offense using the words of the statue itself, as long as the statute fully and\nunambiguously states all the elements of the offense.” Superior Growers Supply,\n982 F.2d at 176.\n\n        Title 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) states: “Whoever obstructs, attempts to obstruct, or in\nany way interferes with or prevents the enforcement of [15 U.S.C. § 1591(a)] shall be\nfined under this title, imprisoned for a term not to exceed 20 years, or both.” Farah\nargues that 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) requires that he act with a “corrupt” mental state and the\nindictment merely alleged “knowing conduct.” However, Farah fails to convince the\nCourt, without any supporting authority, that Congress intended the omnibus provision\nof 18 U.S.C § 1503 to apply to 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), as he suggests. Moreover, Farah\nignores authority standing for the proposition that where a statute is silent as to the mens\nrea requirement, the appropriate standard is whether the act is done “knowingly.”\nStaples v.

Farah was fully aware of the Adan matter;\nhaving provided testimony to the grand jury on three separate occasions, found in civil,\nas well as criminal contempt.

Farah                                         Page 24\n\n\n        During closing arguments, the Government argued that Farah’s conduct deprived\nthe jury, the court and the parties of material information. Specifically, at the conclusion\nof his remarks concerning the proof required to establish guilt as to Count Three, the\nprosecutor argued:\n\n                And in the United States defendants have the right to be\n        confronted by the witnesses against them associated with the actual\n        information.\n                So does it obstruct justice if witnesses, such as defendant in this\n        particular case, refuse to come in to testify as to the information that they\n        have? The material information that they have associated with criminal\n        acts of others.\n                The answer is yes, it does. It deprives a jury, it deprives the\n        Court, it deprives the parties of that material information, to make a\n        decision as to those offenses.\n\nDefense counsel, arguing outside of the presence of the jury:\n\n        Judge, he just stated the reason – why this jury needs to know what a\n        deposition pursuant to 3144 is all about. Because now he’s saying that\n        his case has been obstructed because the defendants have been deprived\n        of his testimony, when in fact the defendants were not deprived of his\n        testimony because the trial has not yet occurred. He can still be called as\n        a witness. All that’s happened is Mr. Farah deprived himself of the\n        opportunity to be released by providing the testimony pursuant to 3144.\n\nThe district judge admonished counsel stating: “Don’t go down that line any more.\nWe’re going to finish this, see what the jury does, and then see if we need to have post-\ntrial motions.”\n\n        Here, even if the prosecutor’s arguments were improper, they were not flagrant.\nFarah’s claim relies on a misunderstanding of the district judge’s decision to vacate his\nconviction on Count One. The district judge vacated his conviction on Count One\nbecause there had been no evidence at trial that Farah’s conduct resulted in the\ninterference with court business. While Farah’s persistent refusal to testify as a material\nwitness may not have interfered with court business, that does not necessarily lead to the\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v. Farah                                         Page 25\n\n\nconclusion that his conduct did not interfere with the Government’s enforcement of\n18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), as correctly concluded by the trial court.\n\n       Moreover, taken in the context of the entire trial, we cannot conclude that the\nstatements so infected Farah’s trial with unfairness as to deprive him of due process. The\nprosecutor’s statements were isolated, occurring only twice during the entirety of his\nclosing argument. Additionally, the record demonstrates that the prosecutor was not\ndeliberately trying to mislead the jury as just prior to discussing the elements required\nto prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), he stated: “And, again, if the Court charges\nyou something different than what the United States says, be sure to follow the Court’s\ninstruction. This is what the United States anticipates the elements for the offenses will\nbe. Okay?” (Id. at 222.) Lastly, the evidence against Farah was sufficient to support his\nconviction on Count Three based on the testimony that he had refused to testify at a\ndeposition for a prosecution directed at enforcing the laws of the United States.\n\n       Farah is likewise not entitled to relief on claim VII.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       Based on the foregoing considerations, we AFFIRM Farah’s judgment of\nconviction on Count Three, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d), and VACATE Farah’s judgment of\nconviction on Count Two, 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), and REMAND this matter for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v.

In 2010, the\ngovernment indicted thirty members of the Somali Outlaws on sex-trafficking charges.\nIn 2012, Abdullahi Farah refused to testify at the trial of nine of the Somali Outlaws\nnamed in the indictment. For his refusal, Farah was found guilty of criminal contempt,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), and given a sentence of four months of imprisonment.\nA year later, Farah refused to testify again, this time at a deposition to be used in\ndifferent trials against the other twenty-one defendants. Once again, the government\nindicted Farah for criminal contempt under § 401(3); he was found guilty and sentenced\nto prison. In my view, these two convictions punished two different acts and did not\noffend the Fifth Amendment. Because the lead opinion sees things differently, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III.A.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       On April 16, 2012, the government was in the middle of trying nine of the Somali\nOutlaws. See R. 2325 (Minute Entry) (Page ID #12374) (Case No. 3:10-cr-260). As part\nof its case against those nine defendants, the government wanted to call Farah as a\nwitness to “identif[y] particular defendants” and “identif[y] particular defendants’\nvoices.” R. 23 at 6:20–22 (Apr. 18, 2012 Hr’g Tr.) (Page ID #74) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85).\nDespite being held as a material witness “[d]uring the course of this trial at this time,”\nid. at 7:17–18 (Page ID #75) (emphasis added), Farah refused to testify, and in response,\nthe government filed a motion to compel his testimony in the ongoing trial. See R. 2 at\n\fNo. 13-6147           United States v. Farah                                                 Page 27\n\n\n1 (Mot. to Compel) (Page ID #2) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). Two days later, the district\ncourt held a hearing, found Farah in civil contempt for “refus[ing] to testify in the Adan\ncase,” and explained that “[i]f [Farah] [did not] change [his] mind, [he would] be held\nin custody pending the duration of the Adan trial.” R. 23 at 17:25, 18:6–8 (Apr. 18, 2012\nHr’g Tr.) (Page ID #85, 86) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). The district court further stated that\nif Farah failed to “testify by the end of the Adan trial, [it] intend[ed] to hold [him] in\ncriminal contempt.” Id. at 18:12–13 (Page ID #86). On April 25, 2012, the government\nfiled a notice with the district court that “it closed its proof” in the trial of the first nine\nSomali Outlaws.1 R. 7 at 1 (Notice Re: Material Witness) (Page ID #15) (Case No. 3:12-\ncr-85). On June 7, 2012, the district court held a bench trial and convicted Farah of\ncriminal contempt in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3). R. 34 at 9 (D. Ct. Op.) (Page ID\n#159) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). The district court then sentenced Farah to four months of\nimprisonment. R. 39 at 2 (D. Ct. J.) (Page ID #178) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85).\n\n        On July 24, 2012, Farah filed a “Motion for Review of Detention Order,” arguing\nin part that 18 U.S.C. § 3144 (the material-witness statute) does not permit the continued\ndetention of a purported material witness if “‘the testimony of such witness can\nadequately be secured by deposition.”’ R. 41 at 7–8 (Mot. for Review) (Page ID\n#192–93) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3144). On August 23, 2012, the\ndistrict court granted this motion in part, ordering that a “deposition shall occur before\nFarah’s sentence for criminal contempt expires in approximately October[] 2012.” R.\n48 at 3 (D. Ct. Dep. Order) (Page ID #291) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85).\n\n        The district court scheduled Farah’s deposition for September 12, 2012. Once\nagain, Farah refused to testify, and the government filed a motion for Farah to be held\nin civil contempt. R. 73 at 1 (Gov’t Contempt Mot.) (Page ID #471) (Case No. 3:12-cr-\n85). The district court decided that\n\n        holding Mr. Farah in civil contempt at this stage of the proceedings is not\n        appropriate. The Court ordered the deposition of Mr. Farah in order to\n        secure his testimony and eliminate the need for his appearance as a\n        1\n         Ultimately, six of the defendants in this trial were acquitted of all charges; the other three\ndefendants were convicted of lesser-included offenses.\n\fNo. 13-6147        United States v.

Mr. Farah’s refusal to testify at\n       the deposition is tantamount to refusing to testify at each of the upcoming\n       trials. Therefore, Mr. Farah no longer needs an opportunity to purge\n       himself of the contempt . . . .\n\nR. 80 at 5 (D. Ct. 9/20/12 Order) (Page ID #566) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). If the\ngovernment wished to punish Farah for his continued refusal, the district court suggested\nthat the government “seek to charge Mr. Farah with criminal contempt” or “seek to have\nthe grand jury issue an indictment for obstruction of justice.” Id.\n\n       On October 3, 2012, the government followed this advice and secured an\nindictment, which charged [Farah] with violating 18 U.S.C. § 401(3), among other\nstatutes, for “refusing to testify in the deposition held September 12, 2012” in\ncontravention of the district court’s order. R. 1 at 2 (Indictment) (Page ID #2) (Case No.\n3:12-cr-196). On April 17, 2013, after a trial, the jury convicted Farah of violating\n§ 401(3).\n\n                                            II.\n\n       On appeal, Farah argues that this second conviction for violating 18 U.S.C.\n§ 401(3) runs afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The majority agrees, holding that\n“Farah’s refusal to testify was carved out in April of 2012 and his subsequent refusals\n‘fell within the limits drawn’ at the April 18, 2012 hearing and ‘only one contempt is\nshown on the facts of this case.’” Majority Op. at 13 (quoting Yates v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105580\"><a href=\"/opinion/105580/yates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (1957). Certainly, Yates is the logical starting point; however, my\nunderstanding of that case and its progeny leads me to the opposite conclusion regarding\nFarah’s double-jeopardy claim.\n\n       In Yates, a defendant—Oleta O’Connor Yates—refused to answer eleven\nquestions over two days of one trial, and for these eleven refusals, she was convicted on\neleven charges of criminal contempt. Id. at 72. The Supreme Court overturned ten of\nthe convictions, holding that Yates’s refusal to testify during one proceeding constituted\na single, continuing contempt. Id. at 74. By overturning all but one of the convictions,\nthe Supreme Court made “clear that the prosecution cannot multiply contempts by\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                           Page 29\n\n\nrepeated questioning on the same subject of inquiry within which a recalcitrant witness\nalready has refused answers.” Id. at 73. After all, a witness could refuse to testify at a\nproceeding entirely and would be guilty of only one contempt. Id. It would make little\nsense to subject “a witness willing to testify freely as to all areas of investigation but one\n. . . to more numerous charges of contempt than a witness unwilling to give any\ntestimony at all.” Id. Under Yates, therefore, a witness can “carve[] out an area of\nrefusal” and decline to answer any questions within the boundaries of her carve out, and\nthe government can bring only one criminal-contempt charge for refusing to testify at\nthat proceeding. Id.\n\n        This reading of Yates, limited as it is to a witness’s refusal to testify during a\nsingle proceeding, is logical and uncontroversial. Courts across the country share this\nview.

Id. at 789.\nOnce the witness finished his first sentence, the government called him to testify before\nthe same grand jury again, and the court upheld another criminal-contempt conviction.\nId. This cycle repeated again, and the Second Circuit upheld a third conviction because\nalthough “[t]he conduct for which the sentences were imposed was similar conduct, . . it\nwas engaged in on three occasions separated from each other by appreciable periods of\ntime.” Id.\n\n        In my view, the record indicates that Farah defied two separate district-court\norders by refusing to testify at two separate proceedings and, thus, committed two\nseparate contempts. In April 2012, the district court ordered Farah to testify at “the Adan\ntrial” involving nine of the Somali Outlaws defendants. R. 23 at 18:6–8 (Apr. 18, 2012\nHr’g Tr.) (Page ID #86) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). In September 2012, the district court\nordered Farah to testify at a deposition to be used in the four other Adan trials, involving\nthe twenty-one other defendants. The subject matter of Farah’s testimony might have\nbeen similar at both proceedings, but, as in Boyden, “[h]is testimony would overlap only\nbecause of the cases’ common origin.” 675 F.3d at 644. In each case, he would be asked\nto testify to the particular defendants’ identity, actions, and voices. See R. 23 at 6:20–22\n(Apr. 18, 2012 Hr’g Tr.) (Page ID #74) (Case No. 3:12-cr-85). Moreover, like the\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                         Page 31\n\n\ndefendant in Coachman, Farah defied “governmental authority in [two] separate\nmanifestations,” 752 F.3d at 691, and Farah refused to testify “on [two] occasions\nseparated from each other by [an] appreciable period[] of time,” McCloskey, 359 F.2d\nat 789. As a result, I see very little in common between Farah’s case and Yates.\n\n        For me, the most analogous binding precedent is Bullock v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"247799\"><a href=\"/opinion/247799/alonzo-bullock-william-a-brakebill-lawrence-j-brantley-clyde-a-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1959), a case that the majority dismisses as “distinguishable on\nthe facts.” Majority Op. at 16. In Bullock, the district court had entered a preliminary\ninjunction, prohibiting individuals from interfering with the desegregation of the local\nschools. 265 F.2d at 687. In late August 1956, the defendant—Frederick John\nKasper—“threatened to have the principal of the school ousted” if he allowed\nintegration, and Kasper “took other steps aimed at . . . restor[ing] segregation in the high\nschool . . . .” Id. For this behavior, he was found guilty of criminal contempt. Id. at 688.\nA few months later, Kasper returned to his despicable ways, encouraging others to block\nthe entry of African-American students to the high school and to beat the minister\nescorting the children to the schoolhouse door. Id. at 687. Shortly thereafter, the federal\ngovernment brought various charges against Kasper and others, including a second\ncriminal-contempt charge for Kasper. The jury convicted Kasper of criminal contempt,\nand he challenged this conviction on double-jeopardy grounds. We bluntly stated:\n“Under the Constitution Kasper is not immune from prosecution for contempt of court\ncommitted in November and December, 1956, simply because he was found guilty of a\nsimilar contempt which occurred in August, 1956.” Id. at 695. The same should be said\nhere. Farah’s conviction for refusing to testify at a trial in April 2012 involving certain\ndefendants does not, in my view, render him immune from a second prosecution for\ndefying a court’s order to testify at a deposition in September 2012 to be used in trials\ninvolving a different set of defendants.\n\n        Importantly, I do not believe that that the government could call Farah as a\nwitness at the trial of one of those twenty-one other defendants and obtain a third\ncriminal-contempt conviction if Farah refused to testify. In refusing to testify at the\ndeposition, which would be used in the prosecution of the other twenty-one defendants,\n\fNo. 13-6147            United States v. Farah                                                      Page 32\n\n\nFarah has carved out his zone of silence with regard to the prosecution of those\ndefendants. He has suffered the penalty for that silence. Calling Farah to testify at a\nsubsequent proceeding in the same prosecution would be hardly different than asking\nhim multiple questions regarding a certain subject in a single proceeding, a practice\nprohibited by Yates. The key difference between the second conviction in this case and\nthis hypothetical third conviction is that in September 2012 Farah had never been ordered\nto testify about that which he refused to testify. If the government called Farah to testify\nin the actual trial of one of the twenty-one defendants who were the subject of the\ndeposition, that would no longer be true—the government would be seeking a\nsubsequent conviction for a continuing refusal to testify about a subject to which Farah\nhad already been ordered to testify.2\n\n         Moreover, the text of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) makes this distinction clearer. A person\nmust “disobe[y] or resist[] [a court’s] lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or\ncommand” to violate § 401(3). In the first order, the court compelled Farah to testify\nregarding nine defendants and their crimes. When faced with this order to testify at those\ndefendants’ trial, Farah could not defy the order by refusing to testify to about twenty-one\nother people under indictment and their crimes. In each case, the government needed\ndifferent information, and therefore, two orders were needed. Whether Farah made his\nintent to defy the district court’s future orders known in advance is beside the point\nbecause there was no second violation of the statute until he actually defied the second\norder. Therefore, Farah’s refusals are two separate criminal actions.\n\n         Finally, it should be noted that in these types of cases, such “contumacious\nrefusal[s] to answer not only frustrate[] the inquiry but can destroy a prosecution,” as\nmay have happened in the first trial. United States v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109248\"><a href=\"/opinion/109248/united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (1975).\n“Here it was a prosecution; the same kind of contumacious conduct could, in another\nsetting, destroy a defendant’s ability to establish a case.” Id. Given the evidence in the\n         2\n           In the abstract, this rule may allow the government to break its prosecutions into multiple trials\nin order to obtain multiple contempt convictions. As a practical matter, I doubt that it would be in the\ngovernment’s interest to do so, and more importantly, there would likely be serious due-process concerns\nif there were evidence that the government was manipulating its prosecution of cases merely to pile on\ncontempt charges against a potential witness. See Boyden, 675 F.2d at 644 (“There is no indication that\n[the witness] was called for the sole purpose of being bludgeoned with contempt penalties.”).\n\fNo. 13-6147         United States v. Farah                                          Page 33\n\n\nrecord, it is clear to me that Farah frustrated the public’s right to every person’s evidence\non two separate occasions and placed himself in jeopardy of two separate charges. I see\nno double-jeopardy problem, and for this reason, I respectfully dissent from Part III.A\nof the majority opinion.\n\f</pre>",
