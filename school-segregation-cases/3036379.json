Cortez, Deputy County Counsel, for Defendants and Respondents Paul J. Pfingst\n\nand Genaro Ramirez.\n\f       In April 2000 a jury convicted Harvey Eugene Larson of resisting an executive\n\nofficer and exhibiting a deadly weapon to a police officer to resist arrest. (Pen. Code,\n\n§§ 69, 417.8.) In 2002 this Court affirmed Larson's conviction. (People v. Larson\n\n(Feb. 08, 2002, D035935) (Larson I).)\n\n       Now, some 13 years after his conviction, Larson has sued Mark Barber, the police\n\nofficer who arrested him; Paul Pfingst, who was district attorney when Larson was tried;\n\nand Genaro Ramirez, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case, for alleged\n\n\"legal malpractice\" and false imprisonment. The trial court sustained demurrers without\n\nleave to amend.\n\n       Larson appeals, contending the court (1) should have filed his motion for default\n\njudgment rather than sustaining demurrers; (2) incorrectly sustained the demurrers; and\n\n(3) abused its discretion in denying leave to amend. Larson's reply brief states,\n\n\"Appellant is still false[ly] imprisoned by respondents and bogus rulings of criminal\n\ncourts\" and \"requests that the Court release him from custody.\"\n\n       We affirm. Larson's claims are precluded by prosecutorial immunity under\n\nGovernment Code1 section 821.6 and by his standing conviction. (See Susag v. City of\n\nLake Forest (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1412-1413 (Susag).)

Larson's Criminal Conviction and Postconviction Challenges\n\n       In April 2000 a jury convicted Larson of resisting an executive officer and\n\nexhibiting a deadly weapon to a police officer to resist arrest. (Pen. Code, §§ 69, 417.8.)\n\nThe jury found true allegations that Larson personally used a deadly and dangerous\n\nweapon in resisting the officer. (Pen. Code, § 12022, subd. (b)(1).) After Larson\n\nadmitted he had suffered one serious felony prior conviction, three serious/violent felony\n\nprior convictions and three prior prison term convictions, the court sentenced him to an\n\nindeterminate prison term of 34 years to life. (Larson I, supra, D035935.) In 2002 this\n\nCourt affirmed Larson's conviction, rejecting his claims the court erroneously denied his\n\npretrial request to represent himself and committed instructional error. (Ibid.)\n\n       Larson has unsuccessfully challenged this conviction and sentence in numerous\n\npetitions for a writ of habeas corpus in state and federal courts: In re Larson (Aug. 13,\n\n2004, D044749); In re Larson (Jan. 29, 2009, D054184); In re Larson (Feb. 11, 2009,\n\nS164455); Larson v.

Lexis 42003.\n\n       Additionally, in 2014, this Court affirmed an order and judgment rejecting\n\nLarson's petition for sentence recall under the Three Strikes law (Pen. Code, § 1170.126).\n\n(People v. Larson (Apr. 2, 2014, D063899).)\n\nB.     Larson's Other Prison Litigation\n\n       Larson's litigiousness goes well beyond challenging the conviction that underlies\n\nthe instant appeal. He is also the plaintiff in these other cases, all of which have been\n\ndenied, dismissed, or otherwise determined to lack merit: Larson v. Runnels (E.D.Cal.,\n\nJan. 25, 2008, No. 2:06-cv-1413 ALA P) 2008 U.S. Dist.

(Larson v. Judge David J. Danielsen (Super. Ct. San Diego County,\n\n2015, No. 37-2015-00013940-CU-PN-CTL).) On January 8, 2016, this Court summarily\n\ndenied Larson's petition for a writ of mandate/prohibition challenging that order. (Larson\n\nv. Superior Court (Jan. 8, 2016, No. D069536).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fC.     Larson Sues Barber, Pfingst, and Others\n\n       In January 2013, while self-represented and incarcerated, Larson filed a complaint\n\nagainst Barber, Pfingst, Ramirez and others.2 Larson alleges \"legal malpractice\" and\n\nfalse imprisonment arising from his arrest and subsequent conviction in 2000 for resisting\n\nan executive officer and exhibiting a deadly weapon to a police officer to resist arrest.\n\nLarson's complaint alleges he is falsely imprisoned and a \"police arrest false report [sic]\"\n\nwas not signed under oath. Larson also alleges there was insufficient evidence of\n\nprobable cause for his arrest and detainment. He further alleges that he took a lie detector\n\ntest, which was \" 'inconclusive,' \" but with one more \" 'point' \" to the right, it would have\n\nbeen scored \" 'truth.' \" Larson alleges he offered to take another \"stipulated lie detector\n\nexamination,\" but the court would not allow lie detector evidence to be shown at trial.\n\nHe alleges there was no probable cause for his arrest, and he was not charged by\n\ncomplaint or indictment.\n\nD.     Demurrers\n\n       Pfingst, Ramirez, and Barber filed demurrers to Larson's complaint. Pfingst and\n\nRamirez asserted prosecutors do not owe a duty of care to criminal defendants, and even\n\nif they did, a district attorney (and deputy district attorney) are immune from liability for\n\ninstituting or prosecuting any judicial proceeding under section 821.6. Pfingst and\n\nRamirez also argued that Larson's \"own allegations affirmatively show that he was\n\n\n\n\n2      Larson did not serve any other defendants.\n\n                                              7\n\fimprisoned under 'due forms of law,' \" which therefore precludes liability for false\n\nimprisonment.\n\n       Barber, represented by separate counsel, made essentially the same arguments,\n\nciting Heck v. Humphrey (1994) 512 U.S. 477 (Heck) and Yount v. City of Sacramento\n\n(2008) 43 Cal.4th 885 (Yount) for the proposition that Larson's standing conviction\n\nbarred his false imprisonment claims. Larson filed tardy oppositions to both demurrers.\n\nE.     The Court Sustains the Demurrers Without Leave to Amend\n\n       The court sustained the demurrers, stating, \"[Larson]'s claim of false imprisonment\n\nis belied by the absence of any allegation in the complaint that his conviction has been\n\nreversed, invalidated, or expunged . . . and . . . section 821.6 provides immunity from\n\nliability for injury caused by instituting or prosecuting any judicial proceeding within the\n\nscope of employment, even if the employee acts maliciously and without probable\n\ncause.\" On March 13, 2015, the court entered judgment against Larson. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Larson's Noncompliance with Rules of Court\n\n       California Rules of Court,3 rule 8.204(a)(1)(B) provides that each brief must\n\n\"[s]tate each point under a separate heading or subheading summarizing the point, and\n\nsupport each point by argument and, if possible, by citation of authority . . . .\" An\n\n\n3      All subsequent rule references are to the California Rules of Court.\n\n                                             8\n\fappellant's headings must \"take the form of propositions, which if sustained would lend\n\nsubstantial support to appellant's request for a reversal.\" (Lady v. Worthingham (1942)\n\n55 Cal.App.2d 396, 397.) The reason for this rule is to assist the court and counsel in\n\nidentifying and responding to specific assertions of trial court error. These rules apply to\n\nLarson even though he is self-represented. In a civil case, a party may choose to act as\n\nhis or her attorney, and he or she is entitled to the same, but no greater, consideration than\n\nthat afforded to other litigants and attorneys. Larson, representing himself, is not entitled\n\nto any special or lenient treatment. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 984-\n\n985.)\n\n        The headings in Larson's brief are: \"Overview and Procedural Posture,\"\n\n\"Applicable Standards,\" \"Request for Judicial Notice,\" and \"Discussion and Ruling.\"\n\nNone of these headings denotes or describes a cognizable issue on appeal. Larson's brief\n\nis mostly a stream of consciousness recital of alleged facts and scattered legal arguments.\n\n        We are not compelled to sort through Larson's brief to try to select those claims\n\nthat are not separately captioned but seem worthy of comment. Nor will we undertake to\n\nfashion viable arguments for Larson from his numerous comments about the rulings or\n\nevidence that led to his criminal conviction. Although in light of Larson's violation of\n\nrule 8.204 we could deem all issues waived or forfeited, we address the issues as we best\n\ndiscern them. However, if we have overlooked an argument buried or lurking in Larson's\n\nbrief under a topic heading that does not identify an argument, the issue is deemed\n\nforfeited or waived. (Opdyk v. California Horse Racing Bd. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1826,\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f1830, fn. 4 [\"The failure to head an argument as required by . . . rule [8.204(a)(1)(B)]\n\nconstitutes a waiver.\"].)\n\nB.     The Clerk Properly Refused to File Larson's Motion for Default Judgment\n\n       1.     Procedural Background\n\n       On November 14, 2014, Larson served the summons and complaint on Pfingst,\n\nand on November 18, 2014, on Barber. Larson did not serve any other defendants.\n\n       On December 23, 2014 (39 days after service), County Counsel filed a demurrer\n\non behalf of Pfingst.\n\n       On January 22, 2015 (65 days after service), Barber's attorneys filed his demurrer.\n\n       On February 13, 2015, County Counsel also filed a demurrer on behalf of\n\nRamirez.\n\n       Meanwhile, after Pfingst's demurrer was filed, Larson sent a self-drafted document\n\nentitled \"Motion for Default Judgment\" to the court clerk on December 30, 2014, and\n\nagain apparently sent the same document for filing on January 15, 2015.\n\n       On January 9, 2015, in a document entitled \"Notice to Filing Party,\" the clerk\n\nreturned Larson's Motion for Default Judgment, stating, \"Your motion is not set and is\n\nbeing returned in light of Defendant's appearance via Demurrer . . . .\"\n\n       Larson contends the clerk should have filed his Motion for Default Judgment\n\nbecause (1) \"[s]ummons show default judgment may be granted if defendant does not\n\nrespond in 30 days[,]\" and (2) \"[j]udgment if defendant fails to answer complaint.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       2.     Analysis\n\n       Larson's arguments fail for at least two reasons. First, even after 30 days have\n\nexpired, if no default yet has been entered, a defendant may file a responsive pleading to\n\na complaint. The court clerk cannot refuse to accept the responsive pleading for filing\n\nmerely because the time to respond has expired. (Goddard v. Pollock (1974) 37\n\nCal.App.3d 137, 141.) Moreover, contrary to Larson's assertions, a responsive pleading\n\nincludes not only an answer, but also a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (a).)\n\nHere, Pfingst filed his demurrer before Larson attempted to file his Motion for Default\n\nJudgment.\n\n       Second, even if Larson's Motion for Default Judgment had been submitted for\n\nfiling before any demurrer was filed, and even if it were construed as a request for entry\n\nof default (as distinguished from request for entry of default judgment), the court would\n\nhave been required to reject it because Larson did not use the mandatory Judicial Council\n\nform for requesting entry of default.\n\n       The California Constitution gives the Judicial Council of California the power to\n\n\"adopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure.\" (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 6,\n\nsubd. (d).) The Judicial Council has adopted a rule making the use of certain forms\n\nmandatory. (Rule 1.31; § 68511.) The \"Request for Entry of Default (Application to\n\nEnter Default),\" form No. CIV-100, is mandatory. (Rule 1.31(b) & (c); see Cal. Rules of\n\nCourt, appen. A, Judicial Council Legal Forms List.) The form may be found online at:\n\n<www.courts.ca.gov/forms> [as of Feb. 11, 2016].\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f          Larson did not use the mandatory Judicial Council form. Use of the mandatory\n\nform for requesting entry of default is important because in addition to containing\n\ninformation used to indicate whether it is being used to enter a default or a default\n\njudgment (a distinction Larson's self-drafted document ignores and confuses), the\n\nmandatory form also contains sections that must be filled out in certain circumstances to\n\ncomply with statutory requirements. For example, if the form is to be used to request\n\nentry of default, the plaintiff must fill out a declaration under Code of Civil Procedure\n\nsection 585.5, something Larson's self-drafted document does not contain.4\n\n          Because Larson failed to use the mandatory Judicial Council form, the court clerk\n\nlacked authority to file Larson's fatally defective and improper request to enter default\n\njudgment. Therefore, the clerk properly rejected his Motion for Default Judgment for\n\nfiling.\n\nC.        The Court Properly Sustained the Demurrers Without Leave to Amend\n\n          1.    Standard of Review\n\n          An order sustaining a demurrer is reviewed de novo. \" 'We treat the demurrer as\n\nadmitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or\n\nconclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially\n\nnoticed.' [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it\n\n\n\n4      Code of Civil Procedure section 585.5, subdivision (a) states: \"Every application\nto enter default under subdivision (a) of Section 585 shall include, or be accompanied by,\nan affidavit stating facts showing that the action is or is not subject to Section 1812.10 or\n2984.4 of the Civil Code or subdivision (b) of Section 395.\"\n\n                                              12\n\fas a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we\n\ndetermine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\n\n[Citation.] And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a\n\nreasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial\n\ncourt has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of\n\ndiscretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility\n\nis squarely on the plaintiff.\" (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)\n\n       2.     Negligence Claims Barred by Immunity\n\n       \"A public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting\n\nany judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he\n\nacts maliciously and without probable cause.\" (§ 821.6.) \" 'California courts construe\n\nsection 821.6 broadly in furtherance of its purpose to protect public employees in the\n\nperformance of their prosecutorial duties from the threat of harassment through civil\n\nsuits.' \" (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins. Program for Employees (SIPE) (2007) 157\n\nCal.App.4th 1056, 1062 (Richardson-Tunnell).)\n\n       Section 821.6 immunity applies to a public prosecutor. (Miller v. Filter (2007)\n\n150 Cal.App.4th 652, 666.) \"The immunity is absolute, applying even if the prosecutor\n\n'acts maliciously and without probable cause' [citations], such as by concealing\n\nexculpatory evidence [citations].\" (Ibid.) Section 821.6 also applies to police officers.\n\n(Asgari v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 15 Cal.4th 744, 757.)\n\n       Section 821.6 not only protects against claims for malicious prosecution, but also\n\nbars actions for negligence. (Amylou R. v. County of Riverside (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th\n\n                                             13\n\f1205, 1210-1211 [police officers investigating crime immune from liability for negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress]; Kayfetz v. State of California (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d\n\n491, 497 [collecting cases].)\n\n       \"The test of immunity is not the timing of the offending conduct but whether there\n\nis a causal relationship between the act and the prosecution process. Thus, if the act is\n\ntaken as part of the process, it is protected by the immunity in section 821.6.\" (County of\n\nLos Angeles v. Superior Court (2009) 181 Cal.App.4th 218, 229.) Although immunity\n\nunder section 821.6 is broad, it does not bar an action for false arrest or false\n\nimprisonment. (Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 12 Cal.3d 710, 719-720.)\n\n       Because the purpose of section 821.6 is to allow the efficient functioning of the\n\ncriminal justice system by enabling public employees to do their jobs without threat of\n\ncivil lawsuits, courts have applied section 821.6 at the pleading stage to reject attempts to\n\nimpose liability for a wide variety of causes of action arising out of criminal or\n\nadministrative investigations. (E.g., Richardson-Tunnell, supra, 157 Cal.App.4th 1056\n\n[judgment on the pleadings]; Jager v. County of Alameda (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 294\n\n[demurrer].)\n\n       Here, Larson alleges the police and prosecutors lied, fabricated evidence, and\n\nwould not allow Larson to present exculpatory evidence. In his brief, Larson asserts\n\nBarber \"committed perjury\" and the \"results of a stipulated lie detector examination were\n\nnot considered\" at his trial.\n\n       Because the acts of misconduct Larson alleges and argues were all part of the\n\nprosecution of the crimes of which he was charged, the conduct is absolutely immune\n\n                                              14\n\funder section 821.6 and the court properly sustained the demurrer to Larson's first cause\n\nof action.\n\n       3.     Larson's Conviction Bars His False Imprisonment Claims\n\n       In Heck, the United States Supreme Court considered whether a state prisoner may\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of his conviction in a suit for damages under title 42\n\nUnited States Code section 1983. (Heck, supra, 512 U.S. at p. 478.) Noting that title 42\n\nUnited States Code section 1983 created a species of tort liability, Heck recognized that\n\n\"civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding\n\ncriminal judgments.\" (Heck, at p. 486.) The Court therefore held that \"when a state\n\nprisoner seeks damages in a [title 42 United States Code section] 1983 suit, the [trial]\n\ncourt must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\n\nthe invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed\n\nunless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been\n\ninvalidated.\" (Heck, at p. 487; see Beets v. County of Los Angeles (2011) 200\n\nCal.App.4th 916, 923.)\n\n       In Susag, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th 1401, this Court applied the Heck rule to claims\n\nunder both title 42 United States Code section 1983 and related state tort law. Susag was\n\nconvicted of resisting arrest. (Susag, at p. 1406.) After he was convicted, Susag filed a\n\ncivil action alleging, among other things, false imprisonment, arising from the same\n\nincident that led to his conviction. (Id. at p. 1407.) This Court noted an essential element\n\nof resisting arrest is that the officer must be engaged in the lawful performance of his or\n\nher duties. (Id. at p. 1409.) Thus, Susag's civil claims, if proven, would necessarily\n\n                                             15\n\fimply the invalidity of his conviction for resisting arrest by an officer. Accordingly, this\n\nCourt determined Susag's state law claims were barred. (Id. at p. 1412.) Moreover,\n\nseveral public policy concerns compelled that result—Susag could not profit from his\n\nown illegal act and should bear the sole responsibility for the consequences of his act, and\n\na determination contrary to the result in the criminal proceedings would engender\n\ndisrespect for the courts and discredit the administration of justice. (Ibid.)\n\n       Later, in Yount, the California Supreme Court confirmed that the Heck analysis\n\napplies equally to a plaintiff's claims under both title 42 United States Code section 1983\n\nand analogous state tort law. (Yount, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 902.)\n\n       Under these authorities, the relevant question here is whether success in Larson's\n\ncivil case for false imprisonment would necessarily imply or demonstrate the invalidity of\n\nhis earlier conviction for resisting an executive officer under Penal Code section 69. If\n\nso, the civil claim is barred under Susag and Yount.\n\n       Under California law, the elements of a tortious claim of false imprisonment are:\n\n\"(1) the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person, (2) without lawful privilege,\n\nand (3) for an appreciable period of time, however brief.\" (Easton v. Sutter Coast\n\nHospital (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 485, 496.) The second element, \"without lawful\n\nprivilege,\" is key here. For Larson to succeed on a false arrest/false imprisonment claim\n\nin his civil case, he must establish the defendants did not have a lawful privilege to arrest\n\nor imprison him.\n\n       However, Larson's conviction under Penal Code section 69 required the\n\nprosecution to establish Larson resisted an executive officer who was engaged in the\n\n                                             16\n\fperformance of his or her lawful duties. Lawfulness of the arrest is an essential element\n\nof this offense. (See CALCRIM No. 2651 [\"To prove that the defendant is guilty of this\n\ncrime, the People must prove that: [¶] 1. The defendant willfully and unlawfully used\n\n(violence/ [or] a threat of violence) to try to (prevent/ [or] deter) an executive officer\n\nfrom performing the officer's lawful duty; AND [¶] 2. When the defendant acted,\n\n(he/she) intended to (prevent/ [or] deter) the executive officer from performing the\n\nofficer's lawful duty.\" (Italics added.)].) \"[I]t is . . . a 'well-established rule that when a\n\nstatute makes it a crime to commit any act against a peace officer engaged in the\n\nperformance of his or her duties, part of the corpus delicti of the offense is that the officer\n\nwas acting lawfully at the time the offense was committed.' \" (People v. Cruz (2008) 44\n\nCal.4th 636, 673.)\n\n       Larson's false arrest/false imprisonment cause of action is barred by Susag,\n\nbecause if there were to be a finding in his favor on false arrest/imprisonment, such\n\nfinding necessarily would challenge the validity of his conviction for violating Penal\n\nCode section 69. (Susag, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1409-1410 [action for false\n\nimprisonment barred by standing conviction for resisting or obstructing a peace officer].)\n\nBecause Larson's conviction has not been deemed invalid, his false imprisonment claims\n\nfail, and the court properly sustained the demurrers to that cause of action.5\n\n\n\n\n5     Larson's reliance on Rezek v. City of Tustin (C.D.Cal., Feb. 6, 2014,\nNo. SACV 11-1601-DOC (RNBx)) 2014 U.S. Dist. Lexis 15117 for a contrary result is\nmisplaced. Unlike Larson, in Rezek, the defendant was acquitted of resisting arrest.\n                                               17\n\fD.     No Abuse of Discretion in Denying Leave to Amend\n\n       The court denied Larson leave to amend, stating:\n\n       \"Plaintiff in his tardy opposition requests leave to amend . . . , and it is\n       ordinarily an abuse of discretion to deny such a request unless the inability\n       to state a valid cause of action is clear. In this respect, plaintiff has the\n       burden to show in what manner he can amend the complaint and how the\n       amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading. . . . He makes no\n       effort to comply with this requirement. He fails to articulate how he could\n       amend the complaint and the legal impact of that amendment. Leave to\n       amend is therefore denied.\"\n\n       Larson contends the court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend because\n\nhe had proven that \"[s]ection 821.6 does not immunize a public employee from liability\n\nfor false arrest or imprisonment . . . [,] and it follows that under the concept of respondeat\n\nsuperior, a public employer is responsible for the tort of false imprisonment by the\n\nconduct of a public employee. [Citations.] Appellant requested that the City of El Cajon\n\nand County of San Diego are included as defendants or allowed to amend.\" (Sic.)\n\n       The court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend. As explained,\n\nLarson's false imprisonment cause of action is barred by his standing conviction. Any\n\namendment to name additional public entity defendants under a respondeat superior\n\ntheory of vicarious liability would be subject to the same fatal bar. A court does not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying leave to amend to assert a claim that is barred as a matter\n\nof law. (Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc. v. City of Irvine (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1124.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment is affirmed.

Larson's Criminal Conviction and Postconviction Challenges\n\n       In April 2000 a jury convicted Larson of resisting an executive officer and\n\nexhibiting a deadly weapon to a police officer to resist arrest. (Pen. Code, §§ 69, 417.8.)\n\nThe jury found true allegations that Larson personally used a deadly and dangerous\n\nweapon in resisting the officer. (Pen. Code, § 12022, subd. (b)(1).) After Larson\n\nadmitted he had suffered one serious felony prior conviction, three serious/violent felony\n\nprior convictions and three prior prison term convictions, the court sentenced him to an\n\nindeterminate prison term of 34 years to life. (Larson I, supra, D035935.) In 2002 this\n\nCourt affirmed Larson's conviction, rejecting his claims the court erroneously denied his\n\npretrial request to represent himself and committed instructional error. (Ibid.)\n\n       Larson has unsuccessfully challenged this conviction and sentence in numerous\n\npetitions for a writ of habeas corpus in state and federal courts: In re Larson (Aug. 13,\n\n2004, D044749); In re Larson (Jan. 29, 2009, D054184); In re Larson (Feb. 11, 2009,\n\nS164455); Larson v.

(Larson v. Judge David J. Danielsen (Super. Ct. San Diego County,\n\n2015, No. 37-2015-00013940-CU-PN-CTL).) On January 8, 2016, this Court summarily\n\ndenied Larson's petition for a writ of mandate/prohibition challenging that order. (Larson\n\nv.

Larson Sues Barber, Pfingst, and Others\n\n       In January 2013, while self-represented and incarcerated, Larson filed a complaint\n\nagainst Barber, Pfingst, Ramirez and others.2 Larson alleges \"legal malpractice\" and\n\nfalse imprisonment arising from his arrest and subsequent conviction in 2000 for resisting\n\nan executive officer and exhibiting a deadly weapon to a police officer to resist arrest.\n\nLarson's complaint alleges he is falsely imprisoned and a \"police arrest false report [sic]\"\n\nwas not signed under oath. Larson also alleges there was insufficient evidence of\n\nprobable cause for his arrest and detainment. He further alleges that he took a lie detector\n\ntest, which was \" 'inconclusive,' \" but with one more \" 'point' \" to the right, it would have\n\nbeen scored \" 'truth.' \" Larson alleges he offered to take another \"stipulated lie detector\n\nexamination,\" but the court would not allow lie detector evidence to be shown at trial.\n\nHe alleges there was no probable cause for his arrest, and he was not charged by\n\ncomplaint or indictment.\n\nD.     Demurrers\n\n       Pfingst, Ramirez, and Barber filed demurrers to Larson's complaint. Pfingst and\n\nRamirez asserted prosecutors do not owe a duty of care to criminal defendants, and even\n\nif they did, a district attorney (and deputy district attorney) are immune from liability for\n\ninstituting or prosecuting any judicial proceeding under section 821.6. Pfingst and\n\nRamirez also argued that Larson's \"own allegations affirmatively show that he was\n\n\n\n\n2      Larson did not serve any other defendants.\n\n                                              7\n\fimprisoned under 'due forms of law,' \" which therefore precludes liability for false\n\nimprisonment.\n\n       Barber, represented by separate counsel, made essentially the same arguments,\n\nciting Heck v.

Larson filed tardy oppositions to both demurrers.\n\nE.     The Court Sustains the Demurrers Without Leave to Amend\n\n       The court sustained the demurrers, stating, \"[Larson]'s claim of false imprisonment\n\nis belied by the absence of any allegation in the complaint that his conviction has been\n\nreversed, invalidated, or expunged . . . and . . . section 821.6 provides immunity from\n\nliability for injury caused by instituting or prosecuting any judicial proceeding within the\n\nscope of employment, even if the employee acts maliciously and without probable\n\ncause.\" On March 13, 2015, the court entered judgment against Larson. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Larson's Noncompliance with Rules of Court\n\n       California Rules of Court,3 rule 8.204(a)(1)(B) provides that each brief must\n\n\"[s]tate each point under a separate heading or subheading summarizing the point, and\n\nsupport each point by argument and, if possible, by citation of authority . . . .\" An\n\n\n3      All subsequent rule references are to the California Rules of Court.\n\n                                             8\n\fappellant's headings must \"take the form of propositions, which if sustained would lend\n\nsubstantial support to appellant's request for a reversal.\" (Lady v. Worthingham (1942)\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397.) The reason for this rule is to assist the court and counsel in\n\nidentifying and responding to specific assertions of trial court error. These rules apply to\n\nLarson even though he is self-represented. In a civil case, a party may choose to act as\n\nhis or her attorney, and he or she is entitled to the same, but no greater, consideration than\n\nthat afforded to other litigants and attorneys. Larson, representing himself, is not entitled\n\nto any special or lenient treatment. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611810/rappleyea-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984-\n\n985.)\n\n        The headings in Larson's brief are: \"Overview and Procedural Posture,\"\n\n\"Applicable Standards,\" \"Request for Judicial Notice,\" and \"Discussion and Ruling.\"\n\nNone of these headings denotes or describes a cognizable issue on appeal. Larson's brief\n\nis mostly a stream of consciousness recital of alleged facts and scattered legal arguments.\n\n        We are not compelled to sort through Larson's brief to try to select those claims\n\nthat are not separately captioned but seem worthy of comment. Nor will we undertake to\n\nfashion viable arguments for Larson from his numerous comments about the rulings or\n\nevidence that led to his criminal conviction. Although in light of Larson's violation of\n\nrule 8.204 we could deem all issues waived or forfeited, we address the issues as we best\n\ndiscern them. However, if we have overlooked an argument buried or lurking in Larson's\n\nbrief under a topic heading that does not identify an argument, the issue is deemed\n\nforfeited or waived. (Opdyk v. California Horse Racing Bd. (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The Clerk Properly Refused to File Larson's Motion for Default Judgment\n\n       1.     Procedural Background\n\n       On November 14, 2014, Larson served the summons and complaint on Pfingst,\n\nand on November 18, 2014, on Barber. Larson did not serve any other defendants.\n\n       On December 23, 2014 (39 days after service), County Counsel filed a demurrer\n\non behalf of Pfingst.\n\n       On January 22, 2015 (65 days after service), Barber's attorneys filed his demurrer.\n\n       On February 13, 2015, County Counsel also filed a demurrer on behalf of\n\nRamirez.\n\n       Meanwhile, after Pfingst's demurrer was filed, Larson sent a self-drafted document\n\nentitled \"Motion for Default Judgment\" to the court clerk on December 30, 2014, and\n\nagain apparently sent the same document for filing on January 15, 2015.\n\n       On January 9, 2015, in a document entitled \"Notice to Filing Party,\" the clerk\n\nreturned Larson's Motion for Default Judgment, stating, \"Your motion is not set and is\n\nbeing returned in light of Defendant's appearance via Demurrer . . . .\"\n\n       Larson contends the clerk should have filed his Motion for Default Judgment\n\nbecause (1) \"[s]ummons show default judgment may be granted if defendant does not\n\nrespond in 30 days[,]\" and (2) \"[j]udgment if defendant fails to answer complaint.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       2.     Analysis\n\n       Larson's arguments fail for at least two reasons. First, even after 30 days have\n\nexpired, if no default yet has been entered, a defendant may file a responsive pleading to\n\na complaint. The court clerk cannot refuse to accept the responsive pleading for filing\n\nmerely because the time to respond has expired. (Goddard v. Pollock (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2181039\"><a href=\"/opinion/2181039/goddard-v-pollock/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141.) Moreover, contrary to Larson's assertions, a responsive pleading\n\nincludes not only an answer, but also a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (a).)\n\nHere, Pfingst filed his demurrer before Larson attempted to file his Motion for Default\n\nJudgment.\n\n       Second, even if Larson's Motion for Default Judgment had been submitted for\n\nfiling before any demurrer was filed, and even if it were construed as a request for entry\n\nof default (as distinguished from request for entry of default judgment), the court would\n\nhave been required to reject it because Larson did not use the mandatory Judicial Council\n\nform for requesting entry of default.\n\n       The California Constitution gives the Judicial Council of California the power to\n\n\"adopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure.\" (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 6,\n\nsubd. (d).) The Judicial Council has adopted a rule making the use of certain forms\n\nmandatory. (Rule 1.31; § 68511.) The \"Request for Entry of Default (Application to\n\nEnter Default),\" form No. CIV-100, is mandatory. (Rule 1.31(b) & (c); see Cal. Rules of\n\nCourt, appen. A, Judicial Council Legal Forms List.) The form may be found online at:\n\n<www.courts.ca.gov/forms> [as of Feb. 11, 2016].\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f          Larson did not use the mandatory Judicial Council form. Use of the mandatory\n\nform for requesting entry of default is important because in addition to containing\n\ninformation used to indicate whether it is being used to enter a default or a default\n\njudgment (a distinction Larson's self-drafted document ignores and confuses), the\n\nmandatory form also contains sections that must be filled out in certain circumstances to\n\ncomply with statutory requirements. For example, if the form is to be used to request\n\nentry of default, the plaintiff must fill out a declaration under Code of Civil Procedure\n\nsection 585.5, something Larson's self-drafted document does not contain.4\n\n          Because Larson failed to use the mandatory Judicial Council form, the court clerk\n\nlacked authority to file Larson's fatally defective and improper request to enter default\n\njudgment. Therefore, the clerk properly rejected his Motion for Default Judgment for\n\nfiling.\n\nC.        The Court Properly Sustained the Demurrers Without Leave to Amend\n\n          1.    Standard of Review\n\n          An order sustaining a demurrer is reviewed de novo. \" 'We treat the demurrer as\n\nadmitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or\n\nconclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially\n\nnoticed.' [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it\n\n\n\n4      Code of Civil Procedure section 585.5, subdivision (a) states: \"Every application\nto enter default under subdivision (a) of Section 585 shall include, or be accompanied by,\nan affidavit stating facts showing that the action is or is not subject to Section 1812.10 or\n2984.4 of the Civil Code or subdivision (b) of Section 395.\"\n\n                                              12\n\fas a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we\n\ndetermine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\n\n[Citation.] And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a\n\nreasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial\n\ncourt has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of\n\ndiscretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility\n\nis squarely on the plaintiff.\" (Blank v.

(E.g., Richardson-Tunnell, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255355\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255355/richardson-tunnell-v-school-insurance-program/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In his brief, Larson asserts\n\nBarber \"committed perjury\" and the \"results of a stipulated lie detector examination were\n\nnot considered\" at his trial.\n\n       Because the acts of misconduct Larson alleges and argues were all part of the\n\nprosecution of the crimes of which he was charged, the conduct is absolutely immune\n\n                                              14\n\funder section 821.6 and the court properly sustained the demurrer to Larson's first cause\n\nof action.\n\n       3.     Larson's Conviction Bars His False Imprisonment Claims\n\n       In Heck, the United States Supreme Court considered whether a state prisoner may\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of his conviction in a suit for damages under title 42\n\nUnited States Code section 1983. (Heck, supra, 512 U.S. at p. 478.) Noting that title 42\n\nUnited States Code section 1983 created a species of tort liability, Heck recognized that\n\n\"civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding\n\ncriminal judgments.\" (Heck, at p. 486.) The Court therefore held that \"when a state\n\nprisoner seeks damages in a [title 42 United States Code section] 1983 suit, the [trial]\n\ncourt must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\n\nthe invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed\n\nunless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been\n\ninvalidated.\" (Heck, at p. 487; see Beets v. County of Los Angeles (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 923.)\n\n       In Susag, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274120\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274120/susag-v-city-of-lake-forest/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, this Court applied the Heck rule to claims\n\nunder both title 42 United States Code section 1983 and related state tort law. Susag was\n\nconvicted of resisting arrest. (Susag, at p. 1406.) After he was convicted, Susag filed a\n\ncivil action alleging, among other things, false imprisonment, arising from the same\n\nincident that led to his conviction. (Id. at p. 1407.) This Court noted an essential element\n\nof resisting arrest is that the officer must be engaged in the lawful performance of his or\n\nher duties. (Id. at p. 1409.) Thus, Susag's civil claims, if proven, would necessarily\n\n                                             15\n\fimply the invalidity of his conviction for resisting arrest by an officer. Accordingly, this\n\nCourt determined Susag's state law claims were barred. (Id. at p. 1412.) Moreover,\n\nseveral public policy concerns compelled that result—Susag could not profit from his\n\nown illegal act and should bear the sole responsibility for the consequences of his act, and\n\na determination contrary to the result in the criminal proceedings would engender\n\ndisrespect for the courts and discredit the administration of justice. (Ibid.)\n\n       Later, in Yount, the California Supreme Court confirmed that the Heck analysis\n\napplies equally to a plaintiff's claims under both title 42 United States Code section 1983\n\nand analogous state tort law. (Yount, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 902.)\n\n       Under these authorities, the relevant question here is whether success in Larson's\n\ncivil case for false imprisonment would necessarily imply or demonstrate the invalidity of\n\nhis earlier conviction for resisting an executive officer under Penal Code section 69. If\n\nso, the civil claim is barred under Susag and Yount.\n\n       Under California law, the elements of a tortious claim of false imprisonment are:\n\n\"(1) the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person, (2) without lawful privilege,\n\nand (3) for an appreciable period of time, however brief.\" (Easton v. Sutter Coast\n\nHospital (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271368/easton-v-sutter-coast-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496.) The second element, \"without lawful\n\nprivilege,\" is key here. For Larson to succeed on a false arrest/false imprisonment claim\n\nin his civil case, he must establish the defendants did not have a lawful privilege to arrest\n\nor imprison him.\n\n       However, Larson's conviction under Penal Code section 69 required the\n\nprosecution to establish Larson resisted an executive officer who was engaged in the\n\n                                             16\n\fperformance of his or her lawful duties. Lawfulness of the arrest is an essential element\n\nof this offense. (See CALCRIM No. 2651 [\"To prove that the defendant is guilty of this\n\ncrime, the People must prove that: [¶] 1. The defendant willfully and unlawfully used\n\n(violence/ [or] a threat of violence) to try to (prevent/ [or] deter) an executive officer\n\nfrom performing the officer's lawful duty; AND [¶] 2. When the defendant acted,\n\n(he/she) intended to (prevent/ [or] deter) the executive officer from performing the\n\nofficer's lawful duty.\" (Italics added.)].) \"[I]t is . . . a 'well-established rule that when a\n\nstatute makes it a crime to commit any act against a peace officer engaged in the\n\nperformance of his or her duties, part of the corpus delicti of the offense is that the officer\n\nwas acting lawfully at the time the offense was committed.' \" (People v. Cruz (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2584939\"><a href=\"/opinion/2584939/people-v-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673.)\n\n       Larson's false arrest/false imprisonment cause of action is barred by Susag,\n\nbecause if there were to be a finding in his favor on false arrest/imprisonment, such\n\nfinding necessarily would challenge the validity of his conviction for violating Penal\n\nCode section 69. (Susag, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1409-1410 [action for false\n\nimprisonment barred by standing conviction for resisting or obstructing a peace officer].)\n\nBecause Larson's conviction has not been deemed invalid, his false imprisonment claims\n\nfail, and the court properly sustained the demurrers to that cause of action.5\n\n\n\n\n5     Larson's reliance on Rezek v. City of Tustin (C.D.Cal., Feb. 6, 2014,\nNo. SACV 11-1601-DOC (RNBx)) 2014 U.S. Dist. Lexis 15117 for a contrary result is\nmisplaced. Unlike Larson, in Rezek, the defendant was acquitted of resisting arrest.\n                                               17\n\fD.     No Abuse of Discretion in Denying Leave to Amend\n\n       The court denied Larson leave to amend, stating:\n\n       \"Plaintiff in his tardy opposition requests leave to amend . . . , and it is\n       ordinarily an abuse of discretion to deny such a request unless the inability\n       to state a valid cause of action is clear. In this respect, plaintiff has the\n       burden to show in what manner he can amend the complaint and how the\n       amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading. . . . He makes no\n       effort to comply with this requirement. He fails to articulate how he could\n       amend the complaint and the legal impact of that amendment. Leave to\n       amend is therefore denied.\"\n\n       Larson contends the court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend because\n\nhe had proven that \"[s]ection 821.6 does not immunize a public employee from liability\n\nfor false arrest or imprisonment . . . [,] and it follows that under the concept of respondeat\n\nsuperior, a public employer is responsible for the tort of false imprisonment by the\n\nconduct of a public employee. [Citations.] Appellant requested that the City of El Cajon\n\nand County of San Diego are included as defendants or allowed to amend.\" (Sic.)\n\n       The court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend. As explained,\n\nLarson's false imprisonment cause of action is barred by his standing conviction. Any\n\namendment to name additional public entity defendants under a respondeat superior\n\ntheory of vicarious liability would be subject to the same fatal bar. A court does not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying leave to amend to assert a claim that is barred as a matter\n\nof law. (Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc. v.
