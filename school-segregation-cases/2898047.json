We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n        LRSD has been involved in federal desegregation litigation since 1956; the\npresent phase of this case commenced in 1982. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski\nCounty Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 778 F.2d 404 (8th Cir. 1985) (en banc); see also\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 921 F.2d 1371,\n1376-83 (8th Cir. 1990) (chronicling litigation history); Polly J. Price, The Little Rock\nSchool Desegregation Cases in Richard Arnold’s Court, 58 Ark. L. Rev. 611, 622-47\n(2005). In 1989, the district court approved an interdistrict settlement plan (1989\nSettlement), which specified that the district court would supervise the remedial\ndesegregation efforts of LRSD and two neighboring school districts. We ordered the\ncreation of the Office of Desegregation Monitoring (ODM) to assist the district court\nin its supervision. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County, 921 F.2d at 1388,\n1394.\n\n       By 1996, it had become apparent to the parties and the district court that LRSD\nwould be unable to meet the terms of the 1989 Settlement. At the suggestion of the\ndistrict court, LRSD and Lorene Joshua (Joshua), the class representative for all\nAfrican-American students enrolled in LRSD and the two neighboring districts,\nentered into negotiations to modify LRSD’s obligations. The fruit of these\nnegotiations was the Revised Desegregation and Education Plan (Revised Plan),\nwhich the district court approved in 1998. It was agreed that if LRSD substantially\ncomplied with the terms of the Revised Plan, it would be declared unitary at the\nconclusion of the 2000-2001 school year. The Revised Plan required Joshua to submit\nany unresolved compliance issues to the ODM for facilitation of an agreement.\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable William R. Wilson, Jr., United States District Judge for the\nEastern District of Arkansas.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fRevised Plan § 8.2.4. If the ODM could not resolve the issue “after good faith\nattempts at facilitation,” Joshua could seek resolution of the issue with the district\ncourt. Id. § 8.2.5.\n\n      In 2002, the district court granted LRSD partial unitary status, finding that it\nhad complied with all but section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan. Little Rock Sch. Dist. v.\nPulaski County Special Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d 988, 1089 (E.D. Ark. 2002).\nSection 2.7.1 provided that:\n\n      LRSD shall assess the academic programs implemented pursuant to\n      Section 2.7 after each year in order to determine the effectiveness of the\n      academic programs in improving African-American achievement. If this\n      assessment reveals that a program has not and likely will not improve\n      African-American achievement, LRSD shall take appropriate action in\n      the form of either modifying how the program is implemented or\n      replacing the program.\n\nCompliance Plan, Oct. 10, 2002, at 1 (footnote omitted). The district court imposed\na compliance remedy (2002 Remedy) designed to bring LRSD into substantial\ncompliance with section 2.7.1. Id. at 1087-88. On appeal by Joshua from the district\ncourt’s unitary-status ruling, we affirmed. Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Armstrong, 359\nF.3d 957 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n      On March 15, 2004, following what it believed was its substantial compliance\nwith section 2.7.1 and the 2002 Remedy, LRSD asked to be declared unitary. Joshua\nopposed the request. On June 30, 2004, the district court concluded that LRSD had\nnot substantially complied with its obligations, denied unitary status, and imposed a\nnew compliance remedy (2004 Remedy). It is from this judgment that LRSD now\nappeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f                                            II.\n       Although this case traces its roots to federal desegregation efforts, the instant\nappeal presents no constitutional issues. The constitutional requirements for unitary\nstatus are set forth in Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 435-38 (1968),\nwhich held that a school district may be declared unitary and lacking racial\ndiscrimination based on satisfactory performance in five areas of a school district’s\noperations: (1) student assignment; (2) faculty and staff assignment; (3) transportation;\n(4) extracurricular activities; and (5) facilities. LRSD has met these requirements.\nSee 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1089 (declaring LRSD “partially unitary with regard to all\naspects of its operations, because it has substantially complied with all sections of the\nRevised Plan, save for those obligations contained in § 2.7.1”). As the district court\nnoted in 2002, the Revised Plan “included other desegregation obligations that went\nbeyond Green’s constitutional floor for a school district to become unitary.” Id. at\n1032.\n\n       Section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan refers to section 2.7, which required LRSD\nto “implement programs, policies and/or procedures designed to improve and\nremediate the academic achievement of African-American students, including but not\nlimited to Section 5 of this Revised Plan.” The impetus for section 2.7 is colloquially\nreferred to as the “achievement gap” between minority students and white students in\nthe public school systems. For section 2.7.1 to meet the constitutional threshold of a\ndesegregation remedy, the achievement gap that it was designed to remedy would\nhave to “directly address and relate to the constitutional violation itself.” Missouri v.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88 (1995); see also Bd. of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248\n(1991) (“The legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive\ndecree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the Constitution by the local\nauthorities.”). As the district court observed in 2002:\n\n      [N]o court has ever determined generally, or with the specificity required\n      in [Jenkins], what portion, if any, of the minority student achievement\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      gap in LRSD is causally linked as a vestige of de jure segregation.\n      Furthermore, Joshua has failed to introduce any evidence to establish\n      that: (1) the achievement gap is causally linked to the system of de jure\n      segregation which existed in LRSD decades earlier; and (2) the portion\n      of the achievement gap which is attributable to de jure segregation, after\n      excluding all of the socioeconomic factors that also have contributed to\n      that gap.\n\n237 F. Supp. 2d at 1040. Cf. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 246 F.3d\n1073, 1076 (7th Cir. 2001) (“[I]t is obvious that other factors besides discrimination\ncontribute to unequal educational attainment, such as poverty, parents’ education and\nemployment, family size, parental attitudes and behavior, prenatal, neonatal, and child\nhealth care, peer-group pressures, and ethnic culture.”). Accordingly, it is unclear\nwhether LRSD’s efforts to remedy the achievement gap are constitutionally\ncompelled. We need not determine that issue, however, because LRSD’s obligations\nunder section 2.7.1 are clearly contractual matters. Thus, we examine LRSD’s\ncompliance under ordinary rules of contract interpretation.\n\n       LRSD’s obligations under section 2.7.1 therefore arise as a matter of contract,\nnot constitutional law, and thus we examine LRSD’s compliance under ordinary rules\nof contract interpretation. United States v. Knote, 29 F.3d 1297, 1299 (8th Cir. 1994).\nWe review the district court’s factual findings for clear error, Little Rock Sch. Dist.\nv. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist., 83 F.3d 1013, 1017 (8th Cir. 1996), and its\nmodification of a consent decree for an abuse of discretion. McDonald v. Carnahan,\n908 F.2d 388, 390 (8th Cir. 1990). We review de novo the district court’s\ninterpretation of the terms of the Revised Plan. Armstrong, 359 F.3d at 965.\n\n                                        III.\n      This litigation has been complicated by the shifting terminology employed by\nLRSD, Joshua, and the district court. Specifically, efforts to resolve this case since\nthe Revised Plan took effect in 1998 have been marked by confusion over four terms:\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f(1) assessment; (2) evaluation; (3) program; and (4) key program. The plain language\nof section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, quoted in Part I, supra, required LRSD to assess\nacademic programs implemented pursuant to section 2.7, including but not limited to\nprograms implemented under section 5.\n\n                                         A.\n       On March 15, 2000, LRSD submitted an Interim Compliance Report that\ndescribed how it would meet its obligations under the Revised Plan. The report\nidentified myriad programs that had been implemented pursuant to section 2.7 and\nsection 5,2 and set forth both a “Program Evaluation Agenda”3 and an “Assessment\n\n\n      2\n       The section 2.7 programs included: Title I Programs, PLATO Labs,\nAccelerated Learning Center, Alternative Learning Center, Summer School, Tutoring\nPrograms, Little Rock LEADERS, ACT Tutoring, Career Orientation, Block\nScheduling, High School Advisory Program, Personalized Education Plan, K-12\nScience (including specific programs for four different grade levels), Professional\nDevelopment for Science Teachers, and Citizenship and Character Education. See\nInterim Compliance Report at 47-51. The section 5 programs appear to include:\nHome Instruction Program for Pre-School Youngsters (HIPPY); Rockefeller’s Infant,\nToddler, and Three-Year-Old Program; Pre-Kindergarten; Pre-Kindergarten Program\nExpansion; Early Literacy Learning in Arkansas; PreK-3 Literacy Plan;\nPreKindergarten Professional Development; Animated Literacy; Early Literacy\n(various grades); Effective Literacy (various grades); Kindergarten I Like Me Project;\nSuccess for All; Direct Instruction; Reading Recovery; Assessment System;\nProfessional Development (all grades); Multicultural Reading and Thinking; Reading\nand Writing Workshop; Thematic Instruction; High School English; Summer Algebra\nReadiness Training (SMART); Family Mathematics; Elementary School Technology-\nBased Programs; Middle School Keyboarding; New High School Technology\nCourses; and Keyboarding Credit by Examination. Id. at 93-127.\n      3\n        The Program Evaluation Agenda indicated that LRSD would evaluate the\nfollowing eight programs: PreK-3 Literacy, Success for All, Direct Instruction, the\nimplementation of middle schools, English as a Second Language, National Science\nFoundation project components, Twenty-First Century Projects, and Waiver Process.\nId. at 53-57.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fPlan” in response to section 2.7.1. Interim Compliance Report at 53-57.\nSignificantly, the Program Evaluation Agenda indicated that LRSD would evaluate\n(rather than assess) only a small subset of the section 2.7 and section 5 programs\nidentified in the Interim Compliance Report, and the Assessment Plan referred only\nto assessing students (i.e., testing), not programs. Id. LRSD submitted its final\nCompliance Report on March 15, 2001. The Compliance Report incorporated by\nreference the Interim Compliance Report. It contained additional information\nresponsive to section 2.7.1 under the title “Program Evaluation,” which indicated that\nLRSD had evaluated fourteen programs.4 Compliance Report at 148.\n\n       As recounted above, the district court granted LRSD partial unitary status in\n2002, but concluded that LRSD had not substantially complied with the requirements\nof section 2.7.1. The district court noted that the Interim Compliance Report had\n“identified almost 100 programs that [LRSD] had implemented to ‘improve and\nremediate the academic achievement of African-American students’” under sections\n2.7 and 5 of the Revised Plan. 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1076 n.135. According to the\ndistrict court, these were “all of the programs . . . that LRSD was implementing in\naccordance with its obligations under the Revised Plan.” Id. at 1018. The district\ncourt elaborated that:\n\n      Section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan required LRSD to assess annually each\n      of the academic programs promulgated pursuant to § 2.7, in order to\n      determine if those programs, in fact, were improving African-American\n\n\n      4\n       The fourteen programs were: PreK-2 Literacy, Comprehensive Partnerships for\nMathematics and Science Achievement, Extended Year Schools, Elementary Summer\nSchool, Home Instruction Program for Pre-School Youngsters (HIPPY), Charter\nSchool, English as a Second Language, Lyceum Scholars, Southwest Middle School’s\nPartnership with Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), Onward\nto Excellence at Watson Elementary School, Collaborative Action Team, Vital Link,\nMiddle School Transition, and Campus Leadership Teams. Compliance Report at\n148.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f      achievement. If the assessment of a program revealed that it was not\n      effective in improving African-American achievement, LRSD was\n      required to modify or replace the program. I find that the purpose of §\n      2.7.1 was to make sure that the programs promised under § 2.7 actually\n      worked to improve the academic achievement of African-American\n      students. I further find that LRSD’s substantial compliance with § 2.7.1\n      was crucial to its commitment to improve the academic achievement of\n      African-American students; for, without performing a rigorous annual\n      assessment of each of the many dozens of programs implemented under\n      § 2.7, it would be impossible to determine which programs were working\n      and should be continued and which programs were not working and\n      should be discontinued, modified, or replaced with new programs.\n\nId. at 1076 (footnote omitted).\n\n       The above-cited passage is consistent with the terms of the Revised Plan.\nElsewhere in its order, however, the district court observed that LRSD’s Interim\nCompliance Plan had specified that evaluations would be conducted for key programs\nincluding (1) Pre-K-3 Literacy Program Success For All; (2) the implementation of\nthe new curriculum in English language arts, mathematics, and science in the middle\nschools; (3) the National Science Foundation project aimed at improving\nAfrican-American achievement in math and science; and (4) the implementation of\nthe School Improvement Plan. Id. at 1077. The district court found “that the much\nmore in-depth and analytical program evaluations, which LRSD agreed to prepare on\ncertain key remediation programs identified in the Interim Compliance Report, were\nan integral and essential part of LRSD’s obligation under § 2.7.1.” Id. at 1079.\n\n        The district court also noted the distinction between “assessment” and\n“evaluation.” According to testimony from Dr. Bonnie Lesley, LRSD’s then-\nAssociate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction, an assessment is “dynamic,\nit is interactive, it’s ongoing, it happens frequently, and it is a measurement, along\nwith the analysis that you would make of whatever results are available.” Id. at 1077.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fIn contrast, an evaluation is “more long term, [it] may consider observations or\nmeasurements in addition to test scores, and is guided by a set of research questions\nthat are usually provided by whoever the consumer is of that report.” Id. The district\ncourt noted that LRSD had interpreted section 2.7.1 “to include an obligation to\nperform some program evaluations.” Id.\n\n      At the conclusion of its order, the district court set forth the 2002 Remedy,\nwhich contained six principal sections. The first four sections are those which are the\nmost relevant to the issue before us:\n\n      A.     For the entire 2002-03 school year and the first semester of the\n            2003-04 school year, through December 31, 2003, LRSD must\n            continue to assess each of the programs implemented under § 2.7\n            to improve the academic achievement of African-American\n            students. LRSD now has over three years of testing data and other\n            information available to use in gauging the effectiveness of those\n            programs. I expect LRSD to use all of that available data and\n            information in assessing the effectiveness of those programs and\n            in deciding whether any of those programs should be modified or\n            eliminated.\n\n      B.    LRSD must maintain written records regarding its assessment of\n            each of those programs. These written records must reflect the\n            following information: (a) the written criteria used to assess each\n            program during the 2002-03 school year and the first semester of\n            the 2003-04 school year; (b) the results of the annual assessments\n            of each program, including whether the assessments resulted in\n            program modifications or the elimination of any programs; and (c)\n            the names of the administrators who were involved with the\n            assessment of each program, as well as at least a grade level\n            description of any teachers who were involved in the assessment\n            process (e.g., all fourth grade math teachers; all eighth grade\n            English teachers, etc.).\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      C.    LRSD must use Dr. Nunnerly [sic] or another expert from outside\n            LRSD with equivalent qualifications and expertise to prepare\n            program evaluations on [fourteen specified programs]. . . . [A]s\n            these program evaluations are prepared, LRSD shall use them, as\n            part of the program assessment process, to determine the\n            effectiveness of those programs in improving African-American\n            achievement and whether, based on the evaluations, any changes\n            or modifications should be made in those programs. In addition,\n            LRSD must use those program evaluations, to the extent they may\n            be relevant, in assessing the effectiveness of other related\n            programs.\n\n      D.    Joshua must monitor LRSD’s compliance with § 2.7.1 and must\n            immediately bring to the attention of LRSD all problems that are\n            detected in its compliance with its obligations under § 2.7.1, as\n            those obligations are spelled out in this Compliance Remedy.\n            Thereafter, Joshua and LRSD must use the “Process for Raising\n            Compliance Issues” set forth in § 8.2, et seq., of the Revised Plan\n            to attempt to resolve those compliance issues. If those efforts are\n            unsuccessful, Joshua must present the issues to me for resolution,\n            as required by § 8.2.5. Any such presentation must be timely.\n\nId. at 1087-88 (footnote omitted).\n\n       The contrast between the assessments of Subparts A and B and the evaluations\nof Subpart C demonstrates that the district court was making a clear distinction\nbetween the two terms. Viewed in this light, the meaning of Subparts A and B is that\nthe district court was requiring assessments for “each of the many dozens of programs\nimplemented under § 2.7,” id. at 1076, irrespective of the requirements imposed by\nSubpart C. This interpretation is consistent with the district court’s order as a whole,\nthe Revised Plan, and LRSD’s Interim Compliance Report. Cf. Little Earth of United\nTribes, Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 807 F.2d 1433, 1438, 1439\n(8th Cir. 1986) (We view an earlier order by the district court “as a whole, and an\ninterpretation that gives effect to all parts of the order will be preferred over one that\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fleaves portions of the order meaningless or insignificant. . . . If there is any ambiguity\nin the . . . order, its meaning is clarified by ‘what preceded it and what it was intended\nto execute.’”).\n\n        On October 10, 2002, LRSD’s Board of Directors adopted a Compliance Plan\nthat outlined how LRSD would satisfy the 2002 Remedy. The Compliance Plan\nindicated that LRSD would “[c]ontinue to administer student assessments through the\nfirst semester of 2003-04” and “[m]aintain written records of . . . the results of the\nannual student assessments, including whether an informal program evaluation\nresulted in program modifications or the elimination of any programs.” Compliance\nPlan at 3. These statements reflected LRSD’s interpretation of the Revised Plan by\nreferring to LRSD’s efforts to administer “student assessments” rather than to its\nobligation to “assess academic programs.”\n\n       The Compliance Plan also stated that LRSD would “[p]repare a comprehensive\nprogram evaluation of each academic program implemented pursuant to Revised Plan\n§ 2.7 to determine its effectiveness in improving the academic achievement of\nAfrican-American students and to decide whether to modify or replace the program,”\nand indicated that LRSD would satisfy this obligation by preparing “the following\nnew, comprehensive evaluations: (a) Elementary Literacy, (b) Middle and High\nSchool Literacy and (c) K-12 Mathematics and Science.” Id. at 3, 5. LRSD thus\nsubstituted “comprehensive program evaluations” for the Revised Plan requirement\nof “assessments” and, more significantly, construed “each academic program\nimplemented pursuant to Revised Plan § 2.7” to mean three broad-based programs.\nLRSD provided a copy of its Compliance Plan to Joshua in October 2002. See\nOctober 25, 2002, letter from John C. Fendley, Jr. (App. 2168-72). Joshua disagreed\nwith the proposal outlined in the plan and, pursuant to the Revised Plan, requested that\nthe ODM facilitate resolution of the disagreement. Although the facilitation\napparently failed, Joshua did not contact the district court regarding the disagreement.\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f      On March 15, 2004, LRSD submitted its new Compliance Report (2004\nCompliance Report). LRSD indicated that its obligation to “[c]ontinue to administer\nstudent assessments” had been satisfied through its implementation of “the 2002-03\nBoard-approved assessment plan.” 2004 Compliance Report at 2-3. With respect to\nhow it had met its self-described requirement to “prepare a comprehensive program\nevaluation of each academic program implemented pursuant to Revised Plan § 2.7,”\nLRSD offered the following explanation:\n\n       The LRSD contracted with Dr. Steve Ross, an expert approved by\n       Joshua, to prepare comprehensive evaluations of the District’s\n       elementary and secondary literacy programs. These evaluations,\n       combined in a single report, were completed and approved by the Board\n       in November of 2003. . . . Dr. Don Wold, a program evaluator funded\n       through a National Science Foundation (“NSF”) grant; Dennis Glasgow,\n       Interim Associate Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction; and\n       Vanessa Cleaver, Director of the NSF Grant, authored the\n       comprehensive mathematics and science evaluation. The comprehensive\n       mathematics and science evaluation was completed and approved by the\n       Board in December 2003.\n\nId. at 3-4.\n\n     On June 30, 2004, the district court concluded that LRSD had not substantially\ncomplied with the Revised Plan or the 2002 Compliance Remedy. The district court\ncommented that:\n\n       While the fields of “Literacy” and “Math and Science” may be\n       convenient ways to divide academic knowledge, they most certainly do\n       not constitute specific § 2.7 “academic programs” (e.g., Reading for All,\n       Early Literacy Learning, Reading Recovery, or Effective Literacy) that\n       LRSD implemented, on a school-by-school basis, to improve the\n       academic achievement of African-American students.\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fD. Ct. Order of June 30, 2004, at 55. Addressing what it perceived to be LRSD’s\nfailure to distinguish between the concepts of assessment and evaluation, the district\ncourt explained that:\n\n       Subparts A and B of the Compliance Remedy obligated LRSD to assess\n       each of the § 2.7 programs. . . . I made no mention of LRSD preparing\n       evaluations of § 2.7 programs because, on its face, nothing in § 2.7.1 of\n       the Revised Plan obligated LRSD to perform “program evaluations.”\n       However, Dr. Lesley made it clear in her testimony that LRSD\n       administrators knew and understood that the “assessment” obligation in\n       § 2.7.1 included the obligation of preparing “program evaluations.”\n       [citation omitted.] Therefore, I concluded it would be best to use the\n       same terms in the [2002] Compliance Remedy that the parties themselves\n       had chosen to use in § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan.\n\nId. at 8.\n\n                                           B.\n       LRSD’s 2000 Interim Compliance Report indicated that LRSD construed the\nRevised Plan’s requirement to “assess all programs” to mean that it must “evaluate\nkey programs.” Because Joshua elected not to challenge LRSD’s interpretation, that\ninterpretation became controlling under ordinary principles of contract law. In its\n2002 order, the district court essentially concluded that LRSD had failed to comply\nsubstantially with both interpretations of section 2.7.1, i.e., that LRSD had neither\nassessed all programs nor adequately evaluated key programs. The district court thus\nimposed a bifurcated compliance remedy. Subparts A and B reverted to the original,\nplain meaning, requirements of section 2.7.1. Subpart C addressed LRSD’s\ninterpretation. Had LRSD appealed, Subparts A and B might well have been deemed\nto be superfluous requirements. LRSD did not appeal the 2002 order, however, and\nthus the district court’s remedy became the governing interpretation of the section\n2.7.1 obligations.\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\f        LRSD’s 2002 Compliance Plan construed Subparts A and B in the same manner\nthat it had previously interpreted section 2.7.1: it took “assess all programs” to mean\n“evaluate key programs.” When Joshua again failed to raise a legally sufficient\nchallenge to this interpretation, LRSD arguably became entitled to rely on its\ninterpretation, i.e., that three broad-based program evaluations would satisfy the\nrequirements of Subparts A and B.\n\n        The district court, however, refused to find that Joshua had waived its right to\nchallenge LRSD’s compliance, saying that “[i]n a school desegregation case that has\nits origins in the infamous 1957 Little Rock school desegregation crisis, no court is\nlikely to hold the silence of Joshua’s counsel—even if they are to be\ncriticized—against the African-American students they represent, and who now fill\nalmost 70% of the total number of seats in LRSD’s classrooms.” D. Ct. Order of June\n30, 2004, at 20.\n\n                                           C.\n       The district court found that LRSD had failed to substantially comply with both\nthe plain meaning of Subparts A and B (i.e., assess all programs) and LRSD’s\ninterpretation of the remedy (i.e., evaluate three key programs).\n\n        At the outset, we have substantial concerns about the highly detailed, complex\nnature of the district court’s 2002 Remedy, which imposes upon LRSD additional\nrequirements, some of which appear to go well beyond those agreed upon by the\nparties in the Revised Plan. The Revised Plan constituted a contract between the\nparties, and the district court was not free to expand its terms beyond that which was\ncontemplated by the parties. Subpart C of the 2002 Remedy exceeded the scope of\nthe Revised Plan, which lacked any requirement for program evaluations. See\nKrupnick v. Ray, 61 F.3d 662, 664 (8th Cir. 1995) (“The law of Arkansas provides\nthat it is the duty of the court to construe the contract according to its unambiguous\nlanguage without enlarging or extending its terms.”); cf. Holland v. N.J. Dep’t of\n\n                                         -15-\n\fCorr., 246 F.3d 267, 281 (3d Cir. 2001) (“A court should interpret a consent decree\nas written and should not impose terms when the parties did not agree to those\nterms.”); Equal Employment Opportunity Comm’n v. N.Y. Times Co., 196 F.3d 72,\n78 (2d Cir. 1999) (“A court may not replace the terms of a consent decree with its\nown, no matter how much of an improvement it would make in effectuating the\ndecree’s goals.”); Armstrong v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305, 315\n(7th Cir. 1980) (“Judges should not substitute their own judgment as to optimal\nsettlement terms for the judgment of the litigants and their counsel.”). LRSD,\nhowever, elected not to appeal Subpart C in 2002, and so that issue is not before us\ntoday.\n\n       In its June 30, 2004, order, the district court set forth an even more highly\ndetailed compliance remedy (the 2004 Remedy). We cite selected portions of that\nRemedy as representative of the level of specificity that the district court engaged in:\n\n             Because LRSD failed to substantially comply with the crucially\n      important obligations contained in § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, it must\n      remain under court supervision for two more complete school years,\n      2004-05 and 2005-06. To avoid any “misunderstanding” regarding this\n      Compliance Remedy, I will be specific. The new Compliance Remedy\n      is as follows:\n\n             A. LRSD must promptly hire a highly trained team of\n                professionals to reinvigorate PRE. These individuals must\n                have experience in: (a) preparing and overseeing the\n                preparation of formal program evaluations; and (b)\n                formulating a comprehensive program assessment process\n                that can be used to determine the effectiveness of specific\n                academic programs designed to improve the achievement of\n                African-American students. I expect the director of PRE to\n                have a Ph.D.; to have extensive experience in designing,\n                preparing and overseeing the preparation of program\n                evaluations; and to have a good understanding of statistics\n                and regression analysis. I also expect LRSD to hire\n\n                                         -16-\n\f     experienced statisticians and the other appropriate support\n     personnel necessary to operate a first-rate PRE Department.\n\nB.   The first task PRE must perform is to devise a\n     comprehensive program assessment process. It may take a\n     decade or more for LRSD to make sufficient progress in\n     improving the academic achievement of African-American\n     students to justify discontinuing the need for specific § 2.7\n     programs. For that reason, the comprehensive program\n     assessment process must be deeply embedded as a permanent\n     part of LRSD’s curriculum and instruction program. Only\n     then will I have the necessary assurance that LRSD intends\n     to continue using that process for as long as it is needed to\n     determine the effectiveness of the various key § 2.7 programs\n     in improving the academic achievement of African-American\n     students. . . .\n\nC.   During each of the next two academic school years (2004-05\n     and 2005-06), LRSD must hire one or more outside\n     consultants to prepare four (4) formal step 2 evaluations.\n     Each of these step 2 evaluations must cover one of the key §\n     2.7 programs, as it has been implemented in schools\n     throughout the district. Thus, over the course of the next two\n     academic years, LRSD must hire outside consultants to\n     prepare a total of eight (8) formal step 2 evaluations of key\n     § 2.7 programs. During the recent compliance hearing, Dr.\n     Ross made it clear that LRSD must conduct these formal step\n     2 evaluations of the key § 2.7 programs in order to continue\n     to make progress in improving the academic achievement of\n     African-American students. Again, I suggest that LRSD hire\n     Dr. Ross--to perform the following tasks: (1) identify the\n     four key § 2.7 programs that should be formally evaluated\n     during the 2004-05 school year and the four key § 2.7\n     programs that should be formally evaluated during the 2005-\n     06 school year; and (2) prepare as many of the eight step 2\n     evaluations as possible. If Dr. Ross cannot prepare all eight\n     of the step 2 evaluations, I recommend that LRSD hire\n\n\n                           -17-\n\f       someone that Dr. Ross recommends as possessing the\n       experience and ability necessary to prepare those evaluations.\n\n....\n\nE.     In order to streamline LRSD’s record-keeping obligation, I\n       am going to require that each of the eight step 2 evaluations\n       contain, in addition to the traditional information and data, a\n       special section which: (1) describes of the number of\n       teachers and administrators, at the various grade levels, who\n       were interviewed or from whom information was received\n       regarding the effectiveness of the key § 2.7 program being\n       evaluated; (2) lists each of the recommended program\n       modifications, if any, that were deemed necessary in order to\n       increase the effectiveness of each of the § 2.7 programs in\n       improving the academic achievement of African-American\n       students; and (3) briefly explains how each of the\n       recommended modifications is expected to increase the\n       effectiveness of the § 2.7 program. This requirement is\n       intended to relieve LRSD of any independent record-keeping\n       obligations under § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan and the\n       Compliance Remedy.\n\n....\n\nG. PRE must submit quarterly written updates on the status of\n   the work being performed on the four step 2 program\n   evaluations that will be prepared during the 2004-05 school\n   year and the four step 2 program evaluations that will be\n   prepared during the 2005-06 school year. These quarterly\n   updates must be delivered to the ODM and Joshua on\n   December 1, March 1, June1, and September 1 of each of\n   those two academic school years. As soon as each of the\n   eight step 2 evaluations has been completed and approved by\n   the Board, LRSD must provide a copy to the ODM and\n   Joshua.\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f             ....\n\n             K. On or before October 15, 2006, LRSD must file a\n                Compliance Report documenting its compliance with its\n                obligations under § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, as specified in\n                this Compliance Remedy. If Joshua wishes to challenge\n                LRSD’s substantial compliance, they must file objections on\n                or before November 15, 2006. Thereafter, I will schedule a\n                compliance hearing and decide whether LRSD has met its\n                obligations under the Compliance Remedy and should be\n                released from all further supervision and monitoring.\n\n             L.     This Compliance Remedy is intended to supersede and\n                    replace the identical compliance obligations that I imposed\n                    on LRSD, albeit with less specificity, in subparts A and B of\n                    Section VII of the September 13 Decision.\n\nD. Ct. Order at 61-67 (footnotes omitted). There was much more in the way of\ndetailed requirements, but those portions quoted are illustrative of what it is that\nLRSD is now being asked to do.\n\n                                           IV.\n       In reviewing the district court’s determination that LRSD had not substantially\ncomplied with the terms of the Revised Plan and the 2002 Remedy, we note, as did\nthe district court, that on March 14, 2003, the same day that LRSD filed what are\ntermed its “Page 148 Evaluations,” Dr. Lesley, the person responsible for overseeing\nthese evaluations, resigned. Two months later, Dr. T. Kenneth James, LRSD’s\nsuperintendent, also resigned. Thus the two persons to whom direct responsibility had\nbeen assigned to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 2002 Remedy were\nno longer available to assist LRSD in the implementation of the Compliance Plan.\nIndeed, the authors of the ODM’s March 30, 2004, Compliance Report observed that\nthe loss of Dr. Lesley and Dr. James at a crucial time in the implementation of the\nCompliance Plan, coupled with the delays and difficulties LRSD encountered in\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\ffilling those positions with acting or interim employees, created “a period of some\nuncertainty” for LRSD.\n\n      We note these facts and observations to highlight the constraints under which\nLRSD was laboring as it sought both to satisfy the requirements of the Compliance\nPlan and to demonstrate through empirically based evidence that it had in fact\naccomplished that goal.\n\n                                          A.\n        LRSD contends that by failing to challenge the adequacy of LRSD’s\nCompliance Plan, Joshua in effect abandoned its objection to that plan and thus should\nnot be heard to contest LRSD’s compliance with the 2002 Remedy. If this case\ninvolved only a dispute between private litigants, we might well have disagreed with\nthe district court’s holding that Joshua had not waived its right to challenge either\nLRSD’s interpretation of the 2002 Remedy or LRSD’s claim that it had substantially\ncomplied with the requirements of that remedy. Given the lengthy nature of the\nlitigation between the parties, however, and the substantial likelihood that LRSD’s\nongoing attempts to comply with the 2002 order will in due course entitle it to be\ndeclared unitary, we will not reverse the district court’s ruling on this issue.\nNevertheless, in light of its failure to call to the district court’s attention to its\ndisagreement with LRSD’s interpretation of the 2002 order, it would ill behoove\nJoshua to raise any further technical complaints about LRSD’s efforts to comply with\nthe 2002 order.\n\n        Without recounting in depth the voluminous evidence that LRSD submitted in\nsupport of its claim that it had substantially complied with the Revised Plan and the\n2002 Remedy, we observe that had the question of compliance been submitted to us\nin the first instance, we might well have found that LRSD had met its burden of proof,\nall the more so in light of the heightened requirements imposed by the district court\nin its 2002 order. It is a close question whether all of those additional requirements\n\n                                        -20-\n\fare within the scope of the Revised Plan or whether they represent newly created,\nafter-the-fact fine-tuning that neither of the parties contemplated when they entered\ninto the settlement agreement that resulted in the Revised Plan.\n\n       Nevertheless, and once again adverting to the lengthy, if not indeed tortuous,\npath on which this litigation has proceeded, we conclude that the district court,\nalthough it may have come close to crossing the line between proper judicial\nenforcement of an agreed-upon undertaking and the imposition of requirements that\nfind no warrant in that undertaking, did not clearly err in finding that LRSD had failed\nto demonstrate substantial compliance with the Revised Plan and the 2002 Remedy.\n\n                                          B.\n       Our concerns regarding the 2002 Remedy are even greater with respect to the\neven more heightened requirements, as illustrated by the portions quoted above,\nimposed by the district court’s June 30, 2004, order. One can understand the\nfrustration expressed by LRSD concerning that which it is now expected to do.\nIndeed, during oral argument we asked LRSD’s counsel, “Can you tell us in plain,\nsimple language what it is that [the district court] wants the District to do that it is\nunwilling to do?” Counsel responded in part by saying that LRSD was complying\nwith the new compliance remedy. In light of that representation, we are unwilling at\nthis time to say that those heightened requirements surpass beyond all measure the\nrequirements to which LRSD committed itself when it entered into the 1989\nSettlement. Suffice it to say that there will be time enough for us to revisit the\nrequirements of the 2004 order if this case should once again come before us. For the\nmoment, then, we offer no comment beyond the observation that substantial\ncompliance means just that, not mathematical precision.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n       In the concluding paragraphs of its June 30, 2004, order under the heading\n“Final Thoughts on LRSD’s Compliance Efforts,” the district court, referring to its\nreview of the history of the negotiations that had led the parties to voluntarily enter\ninto the Revised Plan, stated:\n\n      I review this history to make it crystal clear that LRSD--not the Court--\n      formulated all of the program assessment/evaluation obligations\n      contained in § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan and voluntarily agreed to\n      comply with all of those obligations.\n\n             I know it will be quite a burden for LRSD to formulate,\n      implement, and deeply embed in its curriculum an effective § 2.7.1\n      program assessment/evaluation process that will allow it to determine the\n      effectiveness of each of the key § 2.7 programs. But this is the medicine\n      that LRSD knowingly and voluntarily decided it must take in an attempt\n      to cure the historically low academic achievement of so many of its\n      African-American students.\n\nD.

Order at 67.\n\n       In commenting upon LRSD’s duty to ensure that a significant number of\nAfrican-American students score at or above the proficient level in reading, math, and\nscience, the district court concluded its remarks by stating, “To this end, LRSD must\ndo what it promised to do, and what it has been ordered to do because of this promise.\nIn the words of the poet of the Yukon, Robert Service, ‘a promise made is a debt\nunpaid.’” Id. at 68.\n\n      We add to these comments only the observation that a promise is that which has\nbeen made by the promisor, and not one that may be expanded by others beyond that\nwhich is fairly encompassed by its terms.\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f       Nothing in what we have said in this opinion should be read as in any way\nrelieving the Little Rock School District of its obligation to comply with the\ncommitments it made when it entered into the settlement that culminated in the\nRevised Plan. Our concerns about the district court’s 2002 and 2004 orders arise from\nthe ever-heightened requirements that the District is being asked to satisfy,\nrequirements that may seem to impose a duty of demonstrating mathematical precision\nat a cost and effort beyond that which the District should be required to bear.\n\n       We note that in one form or another the Little Rock School District has been\nunder judicial tutelage for more than two decades now. We hope that it is not too\nmuch to expect that its efforts to comply with not only the requirements of the Revised\nPlan but also with the subsequent embellishments of those requirements will prove\nto be successful.\n\n      With these observations, the judgment is affirmed.\n\nGRUENDER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n       Like the Court, I would affirm the district court’s finding that LRSD was not\nin substantial compliance with section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan as embodied in the\n2002 Remedy. However, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment because I\nfind that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the 2004 Remedy.\n\n       A consent decree “is a kind of private law, agreed to by the parties and given\nshape over time through interpretation by the court that entered it.” Knote, 29 F.3d\nat 1300 (quoting Sennewald v. Univ. of Minnesota, 847 F.2d 472, 475 (8th Cir. 1988)\nR. Arnold, J., concurring)). Although we defer in large measure to the district court’s\ninterpretation or modification of a consent decree, Knote, 29 F.3d at 1300, 1302, the\ndistrict court is not at liberty to ignore what was “agreed to by the parties” by\nimposing new terms that lie outside the intended agreement of the parties, see, e.g.,\n\n                                         -23-\n\fPure Country, Inc. v. Sigma Chi Fraternity, 312 F.3d 952, 958 (8th Cir. 2002) (“When\nconstruing a consent decree, courts are guided by principles of contract interpretation\nand, where possible, will discern the parties’ intent from the unambiguous terms of\nthe written consent decree, read as a whole.”); see also Holland v. N.J. Dep't of Corr.,\n246 F.3d 267, 281 (3d Cir. 2001) (“A court should interpret a consent decree as\nwritten and should not impose terms when the parties did not agree to those terms.”);\nEEOC v. New York Times Co., 196 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[A] court may not\nreplace the terms of a consent decree with its own, no matter how much of an\nimprovement it would make in effectuating the decree’s goals.” (quotation omitted)).\n\n       As the Court notes, ante at 14-15, when LRSD chose not to appeal the 2002\nRemedy, the 2002 Remedy became the governing interpretation of the terms agreed\nto by the parties in section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan. There is no dispute that the only\nhurdle remaining in LRSD’s quest for unitary status is compliance with subparts A\nand B of the 2002 Remedy. Therefore, the district court’s modification should have\nfocused on producing compliance with those terms. Subpart A required LRSD “to\nassess each of the programs implemented under § 2.7” for a year and a half and “to\nuse all of that available data and information [including other information already\navailable apart from the assessments] in assessing the effectiveness of those\nprograms.” Subpart B required LRSD to maintain written records of the assessments\ncontaining (a) the written criteria used to assess each program, (b) the results of the\nassessments, including any resulting modification or elimination of a program, and (c)\nthe names of administrators and grade-level descriptions of any teachers involved in\nthe assessment. Also as discussed by the Court, ante at 9-11, there was a clear\ndistinction in the 2002 Remedy between a less formal, dynamic “assessment” and a\nmore formal, research-paper-formatted “evaluation.”\n\n       Instead of focusing on enforcing compliance with the terms agreed to by the\nparties, however, the district court imposed terms in the 2004 Remedy that are\nuntethered to the requirements of subparts A and B of the 2002 Remedy or section\n\n                                          -24-\n\f2.7.1 of the Revised Plan. Although the district court’s substitution of eight in-depth\n“evaluations” for the agreed-upon “assessments” of each program was arguably\nsuggested in part by LRSD’s own prior attempt to substitute three broad evaluations\nfor the individual program assessments, there is no evidence of a meeting of the minds\nbetween the parties that would allow a number of in-depth evaluations to replace the\nagreed-upon assessments. Therefore, the district court should have simply enforced\nthe assessment requirement as originally set forth in subparts A and B of the 2002\nRemedy. The district court’s substitution of a new set of rigorous evaluations not\nagreed to by the parties was an abuse of discretion.\n\n       There are two other aspects of the 2004 Remedy that are even more significant\nabuses of discretion. First, the district court ordered LRSD to hire a new team for its\nProgram Review and Evaluation Department (“PRE”), and the district court specified\nin great detail the educational background and experience that the district court\nrequired of the new team. In addition, the district court all but ordered LRSD to hire\na particular expert, Dr. Ross (or a person chosen by Dr. Ross), to identify the eight\n“key” section 2.7 programs and prepare in-depth “step 2” evaluations of those\nprograms. Nothing in subparts A and B of the 2002 Remedy suggested that LRSD\nwould have to operate under such detailed personnel qualification requirements in\nassessing the section 2.7 programs. In settling this case, LRSD certainly did not\nconsent to the selection of its employees and consultants by the district court.\n\n        Second, the district court introduced a requirement that LRSD’s “program\nassessment process must be deeply embedded as a permanent part of LRSD’s\ncurriculum and instruction program” (emphasis by the district court). The district\ncourt did not identify any objective standards by which it intends to measure whether\nLRSD succeeds in meeting this “deeply embedded” requirement. The district court\njustified this requirement by stating, “Only then will I have the necessary assurance\nthat LRSD intends to continue using that process for as long as it is needed to\ndetermine the effectiveness” of LRSD’s programs in closing the achievement gap.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fHowever, the district court’s responsibility is to obtain the necessary assurance that\nLRSD is complying with the terms of the consent decree, not to independently assess\nwhether those terms are effective. The parties agreed to annual program assessments\nby administrators and teachers, not to a permanently embedded institutional structure\nof reviewing experts chosen by the district court.\n\n       The introduction of the impossibly subjective “deeply embedded” requirement,\nviewed in light of the district court’s lack of restraint to date in redefining the program\nassessment requirements in subparts A and B and micro-managing LRSD’s\ncompliance team, raises the specter that the district court intends to retain control of\nLRSD’s efforts to close the achievement gap regardless of whether LRSD meets the\nterms agreed to by the parties. No matter how much the district court believed that the\nnew terms in the 2004 Remedy would make an “improvement . . . in effectuating the\ndecree’s goal[]” of closing the achievement gap, a laudable motive, the district court\nsimply “may not replace the terms of a consent decree with its own.” New York\nTimes Co., 196 F.3d at 78 (quotation omitted). For these reasons, I would find that\nthe district court abused its discretion in imposing the 2004 Remedy.\n\n       Finally, I recognize that LRSD already has invested a substantial amount of the\neffort and expense needed to meet the requirements of the 2004 Remedy. At this\npoint, vacating the 2004 Remedy in its entirety and remanding to the district court to\nimpose a new remedy might actually set back LRSD’s efforts to attain unitary status.\nTherefore, I would instruct the district court to order LRSD to complete the eight “step\n2” evaluations as called for in the 2004 Remedy, but I would also instruct the district\ncourt to analyze those eight evaluations under the standards set forth in subparts A and\nB of the 2002 Remedy. Specifically, the evaluation reports individually would need\nto meet the standards of a “program assessment,” rather than an “evaluation,” as\ndefined ante at 9-10; LRSD would have to show that it used “all of th[e] available data\nand information in assessing the effectiveness of those programs” as required by\nsubpart A, meaning that the in-depth data gathered in the “step 2” evaluations would\n\n                                           -26-\n\fbe put to good use; and continued compliance with the written record requirements\nspecified in subpart B of the 2002 Remedy would supplant the unworkably subjective\n“deeply embedded” standard created out of whole cloth in the 2004 Remedy. The\ndetailed personnel requirements imposed on LRSD would be vacated. Such a\nmodification of the 2004 Remedy would restore the standards agreed to by the parties\nwithout disrupting the substantial compliance efforts LRSD has undertaken to date\nwith respect to that remedy.\n\n    Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision to uphold the 2004\nRemedy and would modify the 2004 Remedy as discussed.\n                       ___________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\f",

Rev. 611, 622-47\n(2005). In 1989, the district court approved an interdistrict settlement plan (1989\nSettlement), which specified that the district court would supervise the remedial\ndesegregation efforts of LRSD and two neighboring school districts. We ordered the\ncreation of the Office of Desegregation Monitoring (ODM) to assist the district court\nin its supervision. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County, 921 F.2d at 1388,\n1394.\n\n       By 1996, it had become apparent to the parties and the district court that LRSD\nwould be unable to meet the terms of the 1989 Settlement. At the suggestion of the\ndistrict court, LRSD and Lorene Joshua (Joshua), the class representative for all\nAfrican-American students enrolled in LRSD and the two neighboring districts,\nentered into negotiations to modify LRSD’s obligations. The fruit of these\nnegotiations was the Revised Desegregation and Education Plan (Revised Plan),\nwhich the district court approved in 1998. It was agreed that if LRSD substantially\ncomplied with the terms of the Revised Plan, it would be declared unitary at the\nconclusion of the 2000-2001 school year. The Revised Plan required Joshua to submit\nany unresolved compliance issues to the ODM for facilitation of an agreement.\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable William R.

Joshua\nopposed the request. On June 30, 2004, the district court concluded that LRSD had\nnot substantially complied with its obligations, denied unitary status, and imposed a\nnew compliance remedy (2004 Remedy).

LRSD has met these requirements.\nSee 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1089 (declaring LRSD “partially unitary with regard to all\naspects of its operations, because it has substantially complied with all sections of the\nRevised Plan, save for those obligations contained in § 2.7.1”). As the district court\nnoted in 2002, the Revised Plan “included other desegregation obligations that went\nbeyond Green’s constitutional floor for a school district to become unitary.” Id. at\n1032.\n\n       Section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan refers to section 2.7, which required LRSD\nto “implement programs, policies and/or procedures designed to improve and\nremediate the academic achievement of African-American students, including but not\nlimited to Section 5 of this Revised Plan.” The impetus for section 2.7 is colloquially\nreferred to as the “achievement gap” between minority students and white students in\nthe public school systems. For section 2.7.1 to meet the constitutional threshold of a\ndesegregation remedy, the achievement gap that it was designed to remedy would\nhave to “directly address and relate to the constitutional violation itself.” Missouri v.\nJenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (1995); see also Bd. of Educ. v.

Accordingly, it is unclear\nwhether LRSD’s efforts to remedy the achievement gap are constitutionally\ncompelled. We need not determine that issue, however, because LRSD’s obligations\nunder section 2.7.1 are clearly contractual matters. Thus, we examine LRSD’s\ncompliance under ordinary rules of contract interpretation.\n\n       LRSD’s obligations under section 2.7.1 therefore arise as a matter of contract,\nnot constitutional law, and thus we examine LRSD’s compliance under ordinary rules\nof contract interpretation.

We review de novo the district court’s\ninterpretation of the terms of the Revised Plan. Armstrong, 359 F.3d at 965.\n\n                                        III.\n      This litigation has been complicated by the shifting terminology employed by\nLRSD, Joshua, and the district court. Specifically, efforts to resolve this case since\nthe Revised Plan took effect in 1998 have been marked by confusion over four terms:\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f(1) assessment; (2) evaluation; (3) program; and (4) key program. The plain language\nof section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, quoted in Part I, supra, required LRSD to assess\nacademic programs implemented pursuant to section 2.7, including but not limited to\nprograms implemented under section 5.\n\n                                         A.\n       On March 15, 2000, LRSD submitted an Interim Compliance Report that\ndescribed how it would meet its obligations under the Revised Plan. The report\nidentified myriad programs that had been implemented pursuant to section 2.7 and\nsection 5,2 and set forth both a “Program Evaluation Agenda”3 and an “Assessment\n\n\n      2\n       The section 2.7 programs included: Title I Programs, PLATO Labs,\nAccelerated Learning Center, Alternative Learning Center, Summer School, Tutoring\nPrograms, Little Rock LEADERS, ACT Tutoring, Career Orientation, Block\nScheduling, High School Advisory Program, Personalized Education Plan, K-12\nScience (including specific programs for four different grade levels), Professional\nDevelopment for Science Teachers, and Citizenship and Character Education. See\nInterim Compliance Report at 47-51. The section 5 programs appear to include:\nHome Instruction Program for Pre-School Youngsters (HIPPY); Rockefeller’s Infant,\nToddler, and Three-Year-Old Program; Pre-Kindergarten; Pre-Kindergarten Program\nExpansion; Early Literacy Learning in Arkansas; PreK-3 Literacy Plan;\nPreKindergarten Professional Development; Animated Literacy; Early Literacy\n(various grades); Effective Literacy (various grades); Kindergarten I Like Me Project;\nSuccess for All; Direct Instruction; Reading Recovery; Assessment System;\nProfessional Development (all grades); Multicultural Reading and Thinking; Reading\nand Writing Workshop; Thematic Instruction; High School English; Summer Algebra\nReadiness Training (SMART); Family Mathematics; Elementary School Technology-\nBased Programs; Middle School Keyboarding; New High School Technology\nCourses; and Keyboarding Credit by Examination. Id. at 93-127.\n      3\n        The Program Evaluation Agenda indicated that LRSD would evaluate the\nfollowing eight programs: PreK-3 Literacy, Success for All, Direct Instruction, the\nimplementation of middle schools, English as a Second Language, National Science\nFoundation project components, Twenty-First Century Projects, and Waiver Process.\nId. at 53-57.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fPlan” in response to section 2.7.1. Interim Compliance Report at 53-57.\nSignificantly, the Program Evaluation Agenda indicated that LRSD would evaluate\n(rather than assess) only a small subset of the section 2.7 and section 5 programs\nidentified in the Interim Compliance Report, and the Assessment Plan referred only\nto assessing students (i.e., testing), not programs. Id. LRSD submitted its final\nCompliance Report on March 15, 2001. The Compliance Report incorporated by\nreference the Interim Compliance Report. It contained additional information\nresponsive to section 2.7.1 under the title “Program Evaluation,” which indicated that\nLRSD had evaluated fourteen programs.4 Compliance Report at 148.\n\n       As recounted above, the district court granted LRSD partial unitary status in\n2002, but concluded that LRSD had not substantially complied with the requirements\nof section 2.7.1. The district court noted that the Interim Compliance Report had\n“identified almost 100 programs that [LRSD] had implemented to ‘improve and\nremediate the academic achievement of African-American students’” under sections\n2.7 and 5 of the Revised Plan. 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1076 n.135. According to the\ndistrict court, these were “all of the programs . . . that LRSD was implementing in\naccordance with its obligations under the Revised Plan.” Id. at 1018. The district\ncourt elaborated that:\n\n      Section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan required LRSD to assess annually each\n      of the academic programs promulgated pursuant to § 2.7, in order to\n      determine if those programs, in fact, were improving African-American\n\n\n      4\n       The fourteen programs were: PreK-2 Literacy, Comprehensive Partnerships for\nMathematics and Science Achievement, Extended Year Schools, Elementary Summer\nSchool, Home Instruction Program for Pre-School Youngsters (HIPPY), Charter\nSchool, English as a Second Language, Lyceum Scholars, Southwest Middle School’s\nPartnership with Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), Onward\nto Excellence at Watson Elementary School, Collaborative Action Team, Vital Link,\nMiddle School Transition, and Campus Leadership Teams. Compliance Report at\n148.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f      achievement. If the assessment of a program revealed that it was not\n      effective in improving African-American achievement, LRSD was\n      required to modify or replace the program. I find that the purpose of §\n      2.7.1 was to make sure that the programs promised under § 2.7 actually\n      worked to improve the academic achievement of African-American\n      students. I further find that LRSD’s substantial compliance with § 2.7.1\n      was crucial to its commitment to improve the academic achievement of\n      African-American students; for, without performing a rigorous annual\n      assessment of each of the many dozens of programs implemented under\n      § 2.7, it would be impossible to determine which programs were working\n      and should be continued and which programs were not working and\n      should be discontinued, modified, or replaced with new programs.\n\nId. at 1076 (footnote omitted).\n\n       The above-cited passage is consistent with the terms of the Revised Plan.\nElsewhere in its order, however, the district court observed that LRSD’s Interim\nCompliance Plan had specified that evaluations would be conducted for key programs\nincluding (1) Pre-K-3 Literacy Program Success For All; (2) the implementation of\nthe new curriculum in English language arts, mathematics, and science in the middle\nschools; (3) the National Science Foundation project aimed at improving\nAfrican-American achievement in math and science; and (4) the implementation of\nthe School Improvement Plan. Id. at 1077. The district court found “that the much\nmore in-depth and analytical program evaluations, which LRSD agreed to prepare on\ncertain key remediation programs identified in the Interim Compliance Report, were\nan integral and essential part of LRSD’s obligation under § 2.7.1.” Id. at 1079.\n\n        The district court also noted the distinction between “assessment” and\n“evaluation.” According to testimony from Dr. Bonnie Lesley, LRSD’s then-\nAssociate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction, an assessment is “dynamic,\nit is interactive, it’s ongoing, it happens frequently, and it is a measurement, along\nwith the analysis that you would make of whatever results are available.” Id. at 1077.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fIn contrast, an evaluation is “more long term, [it] may consider observations or\nmeasurements in addition to test scores, and is guided by a set of research questions\nthat are usually provided by whoever the consumer is of that report.” Id. The district\ncourt noted that LRSD had interpreted section 2.7.1 “to include an obligation to\nperform some program evaluations.” Id.\n\n      At the conclusion of its order, the district court set forth the 2002 Remedy,\nwhich contained six principal sections. The first four sections are those which are the\nmost relevant to the issue before us:\n\n      A.     For the entire 2002-03 school year and the first semester of the\n            2003-04 school year, through December 31, 2003, LRSD must\n            continue to assess each of the programs implemented under § 2.7\n            to improve the academic achievement of African-American\n            students. LRSD now has over three years of testing data and other\n            information available to use in gauging the effectiveness of those\n            programs. I expect LRSD to use all of that available data and\n            information in assessing the effectiveness of those programs and\n            in deciding whether any of those programs should be modified or\n            eliminated.\n\n      B.    LRSD must maintain written records regarding its assessment of\n            each of those programs. These written records must reflect the\n            following information: (a) the written criteria used to assess each\n            program during the 2002-03 school year and the first semester of\n            the 2003-04 school year; (b) the results of the annual assessments\n            of each program, including whether the assessments resulted in\n            program modifications or the elimination of any programs; and (c)\n            the names of the administrators who were involved with the\n            assessment of each program, as well as at least a grade level\n            description of any teachers who were involved in the assessment\n            process (e.g., all fourth grade math teachers; all eighth grade\n            English teachers, etc.).\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      C.    LRSD must use Dr. Nunnerly [sic] or another expert from outside\n            LRSD with equivalent qualifications and expertise to prepare\n            program evaluations on [fourteen specified programs]. . . . [A]s\n            these program evaluations are prepared, LRSD shall use them, as\n            part of the program assessment process, to determine the\n            effectiveness of those programs in improving African-American\n            achievement and whether, based on the evaluations, any changes\n            or modifications should be made in those programs. In addition,\n            LRSD must use those program evaluations, to the extent they may\n            be relevant, in assessing the effectiveness of other related\n            programs.\n\n      D.    Joshua must monitor LRSD’s compliance with § 2.7.1 and must\n            immediately bring to the attention of LRSD all problems that are\n            detected in its compliance with its obligations under § 2.7.1, as\n            those obligations are spelled out in this Compliance Remedy.\n            Thereafter, Joshua and LRSD must use the “Process for Raising\n            Compliance Issues” set forth in § 8.2, et seq., of the Revised Plan\n            to attempt to resolve those compliance issues. If those efforts are\n            unsuccessful, Joshua must present the issues to me for resolution,\n            as required by § 8.2.5. Any such presentation must be timely.\n\nId. at 1087-88 (footnote omitted).\n\n       The contrast between the assessments of Subparts A and B and the evaluations\nof Subpart C demonstrates that the district court was making a clear distinction\nbetween the two terms. Viewed in this light, the meaning of Subparts A and B is that\nthe district court was requiring assessments for “each of the many dozens of programs\nimplemented under § 2.7,” id. at 1076, irrespective of the requirements imposed by\nSubpart C. This interpretation is consistent with the district court’s order as a whole,\nthe Revised Plan, and LRSD’s Interim Compliance Report. Cf. Little Earth of United\nTribes, Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480771\"><a href=\"/opinion/480771/little-earth-of-the-united-tribes-inc-a-minnesota-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1438, 1439\n(8th Cir. 1986) (We view an earlier order by the district court “as a whole, and an\ninterpretation that gives effect to all parts of the order will be preferred over one that\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fleaves portions of the order meaningless or insignificant. . . . If there is any ambiguity\nin the . . . order, its meaning is clarified by ‘what preceded it and what it was intended\nto execute.’”).\n\n        On October 10, 2002, LRSD’s Board of Directors adopted a Compliance Plan\nthat outlined how LRSD would satisfy the 2002 Remedy. The Compliance Plan\nindicated that LRSD would “[c]ontinue to administer student assessments through the\nfirst semester of 2003-04” and “[m]aintain written records of . . . the results of the\nannual student assessments, including whether an informal program evaluation\nresulted in program modifications or the elimination of any programs.” Compliance\nPlan at 3. These statements reflected LRSD’s interpretation of the Revised Plan by\nreferring to LRSD’s efforts to administer “student assessments” rather than to its\nobligation to “assess academic programs.”\n\n       The Compliance Plan also stated that LRSD would “[p]repare a comprehensive\nprogram evaluation of each academic program implemented pursuant to Revised Plan\n§ 2.7 to determine its effectiveness in improving the academic achievement of\nAfrican-American students and to decide whether to modify or replace the program,”\nand indicated that LRSD would satisfy this obligation by preparing “the following\nnew, comprehensive evaluations: (a) Elementary Literacy, (b) Middle and High\nSchool Literacy and (c) K-12 Mathematics and Science.” Id. at 3, 5. LRSD thus\nsubstituted “comprehensive program evaluations” for the Revised Plan requirement\nof “assessments” and, more significantly, construed “each academic program\nimplemented pursuant to Revised Plan § 2.7” to mean three broad-based programs.\nLRSD provided a copy of its Compliance Plan to Joshua in October 2002. See\nOctober 25, 2002, letter from John C. Fendley, Jr. (App. 2168-72). Joshua disagreed\nwith the proposal outlined in the plan and, pursuant to the Revised Plan, requested that\nthe ODM facilitate resolution of the disagreement. Although the facilitation\napparently failed, Joshua did not contact the district court regarding the disagreement.\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f      On March 15, 2004, LRSD submitted its new Compliance Report (2004\nCompliance Report). LRSD indicated that its obligation to “[c]ontinue to administer\nstudent assessments” had been satisfied through its implementation of “the 2002-03\nBoard-approved assessment plan.” 2004 Compliance Report at 2-3. With respect to\nhow it had met its self-described requirement to “prepare a comprehensive program\nevaluation of each academic program implemented pursuant to Revised Plan § 2.7,”\nLRSD offered the following explanation:\n\n       The LRSD contracted with Dr. Steve Ross, an expert approved by\n       Joshua, to prepare comprehensive evaluations of the District’s\n       elementary and secondary literacy programs. These evaluations,\n       combined in a single report, were completed and approved by the Board\n       in November of 2003. . . . Dr. Don Wold, a program evaluator funded\n       through a National Science Foundation (“NSF”) grant; Dennis Glasgow,\n       Interim Associate Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction; and\n       Vanessa Cleaver, Director of the NSF Grant, authored the\n       comprehensive mathematics and science evaluation. The comprehensive\n       mathematics and science evaluation was completed and approved by the\n       Board in December 2003.\n\nId. at 3-4.\n\n     On June 30, 2004, the district court concluded that LRSD had not substantially\ncomplied with the Revised Plan or the 2002 Compliance Remedy. The district court\ncommented that:\n\n       While the fields of “Literacy” and “Math and Science” may be\n       convenient ways to divide academic knowledge, they most certainly do\n       not constitute specific § 2.7 “academic programs” (e.g., Reading for All,\n       Early Literacy Learning, Reading Recovery, or Effective Literacy) that\n       LRSD implemented, on a school-by-school basis, to improve the\n       academic achievement of African-American students.\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fD. Ct. Order of June 30, 2004, at 55. Addressing what it perceived to be LRSD’s\nfailure to distinguish between the concepts of assessment and evaluation, the district\ncourt explained that:\n\n       Subparts A and B of the Compliance Remedy obligated LRSD to assess\n       each of the § 2.7 programs. . . . I made no mention of LRSD preparing\n       evaluations of § 2.7 programs because, on its face, nothing in § 2.7.1 of\n       the Revised Plan obligated LRSD to perform “program evaluations.”\n       However, Dr. Lesley made it clear in her testimony that LRSD\n       administrators knew and understood that the “assessment” obligation in\n       § 2.7.1 included the obligation of preparing “program evaluations.”\n       [citation omitted.] Therefore, I concluded it would be best to use the\n       same terms in the [2002] Compliance Remedy that the parties themselves\n       had chosen to use in § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan.\n\nId. at 8.\n\n                                           B.\n       LRSD’s 2000 Interim Compliance Report indicated that LRSD construed the\nRevised Plan’s requirement to “assess all programs” to mean that it must “evaluate\nkey programs.” Because Joshua elected not to challenge LRSD’s interpretation, that\ninterpretation became controlling under ordinary principles of contract law. In its\n2002 order, the district court essentially concluded that LRSD had failed to comply\nsubstantially with both interpretations of section 2.7.1, i.e., that LRSD had neither\nassessed all programs nor adequately evaluated key programs. The district court thus\nimposed a bifurcated compliance remedy. Subparts A and B reverted to the original,\nplain meaning, requirements of section 2.7.1. Subpart C addressed LRSD’s\ninterpretation. Had LRSD appealed, Subparts A and B might well have been deemed\nto be superfluous requirements. LRSD did not appeal the 2002 order, however, and\nthus the district court’s remedy became the governing interpretation of the section\n2.7.1 obligations.\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\f        LRSD’s 2002 Compliance Plan construed Subparts A and B in the same manner\nthat it had previously interpreted section 2.7.1: it took “assess all programs” to mean\n“evaluate key programs.” When Joshua again failed to raise a legally sufficient\nchallenge to this interpretation, LRSD arguably became entitled to rely on its\ninterpretation, i.e., that three broad-based program evaluations would satisfy the\nrequirements of Subparts A and B.\n\n        The district court, however, refused to find that Joshua had waived its right to\nchallenge LRSD’s compliance, saying that “[i]n a school desegregation case that has\nits origins in the infamous 1957 Little Rock school desegregation crisis, no court is\nlikely to hold the silence of Joshua’s counsel—even if they are to be\ncriticized—against the African-American students they represent, and who now fill\nalmost 70% of the total number of seats in LRSD’s classrooms.” D. Ct. Order of June\n30, 2004, at 20.\n\n                                           C.\n       The district court found that LRSD had failed to substantially comply with both\nthe plain meaning of Subparts A and B (i.e., assess all programs) and LRSD’s\ninterpretation of the remedy (i.e., evaluate three key programs).\n\n        At the outset, we have substantial concerns about the highly detailed, complex\nnature of the district court’s 2002 Remedy, which imposes upon LRSD additional\nrequirements, some of which appear to go well beyond those agreed upon by the\nparties in the Revised Plan. The Revised Plan constituted a contract between the\nparties, and the district court was not free to expand its terms beyond that which was\ncontemplated by the parties. Subpart C of the 2002 Remedy exceeded the scope of\nthe Revised Plan, which lacked any requirement for program evaluations. See\nKrupnick v.

LRSD,\nhowever, elected not to appeal Subpart C in 2002, and so that issue is not before us\ntoday.\n\n       In its June 30, 2004, order, the district court set forth an even more highly\ndetailed compliance remedy (the 2004 Remedy). We cite selected portions of that\nRemedy as representative of the level of specificity that the district court engaged in:\n\n             Because LRSD failed to substantially comply with the crucially\n      important obligations contained in § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, it must\n      remain under court supervision for two more complete school years,\n      2004-05 and 2005-06. To avoid any “misunderstanding” regarding this\n      Compliance Remedy, I will be specific. The new Compliance Remedy\n      is as follows:\n\n             A. LRSD must promptly hire a highly trained team of\n                professionals to reinvigorate PRE. These individuals must\n                have experience in: (a) preparing and overseeing the\n                preparation of formal program evaluations; and (b)\n                formulating a comprehensive program assessment process\n                that can be used to determine the effectiveness of specific\n                academic programs designed to improve the achievement of\n                African-American students. I expect the director of PRE to\n                have a Ph.D.; to have extensive experience in designing,\n                preparing and overseeing the preparation of program\n                evaluations; and to have a good understanding of statistics\n                and regression analysis. I also expect LRSD to hire\n\n                                         -16-\n\f     experienced statisticians and the other appropriate support\n     personnel necessary to operate a first-rate PRE Department.\n\nB.   The first task PRE must perform is to devise a\n     comprehensive program assessment process. It may take a\n     decade or more for LRSD to make sufficient progress in\n     improving the academic achievement of African-American\n     students to justify discontinuing the need for specific § 2.7\n     programs. For that reason, the comprehensive program\n     assessment process must be deeply embedded as a permanent\n     part of LRSD’s curriculum and instruction program. Only\n     then will I have the necessary assurance that LRSD intends\n     to continue using that process for as long as it is needed to\n     determine the effectiveness of the various key § 2.7 programs\n     in improving the academic achievement of African-American\n     students. . . .\n\nC.   During each of the next two academic school years (2004-05\n     and 2005-06), LRSD must hire one or more outside\n     consultants to prepare four (4) formal step 2 evaluations.\n     Each of these step 2 evaluations must cover one of the key §\n     2.7 programs, as it has been implemented in schools\n     throughout the district. Thus, over the course of the next two\n     academic years, LRSD must hire outside consultants to\n     prepare a total of eight (8) formal step 2 evaluations of key\n     § 2.7 programs. During the recent compliance hearing, Dr.\n     Ross made it clear that LRSD must conduct these formal step\n     2 evaluations of the key § 2.7 programs in order to continue\n     to make progress in improving the academic achievement of\n     African-American students. Again, I suggest that LRSD hire\n     Dr. Ross--to perform the following tasks: (1) identify the\n     four key § 2.7 programs that should be formally evaluated\n     during the 2004-05 school year and the four key § 2.7\n     programs that should be formally evaluated during the 2005-\n     06 school year; and (2) prepare as many of the eight step 2\n     evaluations as possible. If Dr. Ross cannot prepare all eight\n     of the step 2 evaluations, I recommend that LRSD hire\n\n\n                           -17-\n\f       someone that Dr. Ross recommends as possessing the\n       experience and ability necessary to prepare those evaluations.\n\n....\n\nE.     In order to streamline LRSD’s record-keeping obligation, I\n       am going to require that each of the eight step 2 evaluations\n       contain, in addition to the traditional information and data, a\n       special section which: (1) describes of the number of\n       teachers and administrators, at the various grade levels, who\n       were interviewed or from whom information was received\n       regarding the effectiveness of the key § 2.7 program being\n       evaluated; (2) lists each of the recommended program\n       modifications, if any, that were deemed necessary in order to\n       increase the effectiveness of each of the § 2.7 programs in\n       improving the academic achievement of African-American\n       students; and (3) briefly explains how each of the\n       recommended modifications is expected to increase the\n       effectiveness of the § 2.7 program. This requirement is\n       intended to relieve LRSD of any independent record-keeping\n       obligations under § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan and the\n       Compliance Remedy.\n\n....\n\nG. PRE must submit quarterly written updates on the status of\n   the work being performed on the four step 2 program\n   evaluations that will be prepared during the 2004-05 school\n   year and the four step 2 program evaluations that will be\n   prepared during the 2005-06 school year. These quarterly\n   updates must be delivered to the ODM and Joshua on\n   December 1, March 1, June1, and September 1 of each of\n   those two academic school years. As soon as each of the\n   eight step 2 evaluations has been completed and approved by\n   the Board, LRSD must provide a copy to the ODM and\n   Joshua.\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f             ....\n\n             K. On or before October 15, 2006, LRSD must file a\n                Compliance Report documenting its compliance with its\n                obligations under § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, as specified in\n                this Compliance Remedy. If Joshua wishes to challenge\n                LRSD’s substantial compliance, they must file objections on\n                or before November 15, 2006. Thereafter, I will schedule a\n                compliance hearing and decide whether LRSD has met its\n                obligations under the Compliance Remedy and should be\n                released from all further supervision and monitoring.\n\n             L.     This Compliance Remedy is intended to supersede and\n                    replace the identical compliance obligations that I imposed\n                    on LRSD, albeit with less specificity, in subparts A and B of\n                    Section VII of the September 13 Decision.\n\nD. Ct. Order at 61-67 (footnotes omitted). There was much more in the way of\ndetailed requirements, but those portions quoted are illustrative of what it is that\nLRSD is now being asked to do.\n\n                                           IV.\n       In reviewing the district court’s determination that LRSD had not substantially\ncomplied with the terms of the Revised Plan and the 2002 Remedy, we note, as did\nthe district court, that on March 14, 2003, the same day that LRSD filed what are\ntermed its “Page 148 Evaluations,” Dr. Lesley, the person responsible for overseeing\nthese evaluations, resigned. Two months later, Dr. T. Kenneth James, LRSD’s\nsuperintendent, also resigned. Thus the two persons to whom direct responsibility had\nbeen assigned to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 2002 Remedy were\nno longer available to assist LRSD in the implementation of the Compliance Plan.\nIndeed, the authors of the ODM’s March 30, 2004, Compliance Report observed that\nthe loss of Dr. Lesley and Dr. James at a crucial time in the implementation of the\nCompliance Plan, coupled with the delays and difficulties LRSD encountered in\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\ffilling those positions with acting or interim employees, created “a period of some\nuncertainty” for LRSD.\n\n      We note these facts and observations to highlight the constraints under which\nLRSD was laboring as it sought both to satisfy the requirements of the Compliance\nPlan and to demonstrate through empirically based evidence that it had in fact\naccomplished that goal.\n\n                                          A.\n        LRSD contends that by failing to challenge the adequacy of LRSD’s\nCompliance Plan, Joshua in effect abandoned its objection to that plan and thus should\nnot be heard to contest LRSD’s compliance with the 2002 Remedy. If this case\ninvolved only a dispute between private litigants, we might well have disagreed with\nthe district court’s holding that Joshua had not waived its right to challenge either\nLRSD’s interpretation of the 2002 Remedy or LRSD’s claim that it had substantially\ncomplied with the requirements of that remedy. Given the lengthy nature of the\nlitigation between the parties, however, and the substantial likelihood that LRSD’s\nongoing attempts to comply with the 2002 order will in due course entitle it to be\ndeclared unitary, we will not reverse the district court’s ruling on this issue.\nNevertheless, in light of its failure to call to the district court’s attention to its\ndisagreement with LRSD’s interpretation of the 2002 order, it would ill behoove\nJoshua to raise any further technical complaints about LRSD’s efforts to comply with\nthe 2002 order.\n\n        Without recounting in depth the voluminous evidence that LRSD submitted in\nsupport of its claim that it had substantially complied with the Revised Plan and the\n2002 Remedy, we observe that had the question of compliance been submitted to us\nin the first instance, we might well have found that LRSD had met its burden of proof,\nall the more so in light of the heightened requirements imposed by the district court\nin its 2002 order. It is a close question whether all of those additional requirements\n\n                                        -20-\n\fare within the scope of the Revised Plan or whether they represent newly created,\nafter-the-fact fine-tuning that neither of the parties contemplated when they entered\ninto the settlement agreement that resulted in the Revised Plan.\n\n       Nevertheless, and once again adverting to the lengthy, if not indeed tortuous,\npath on which this litigation has proceeded, we conclude that the district court,\nalthough it may have come close to crossing the line between proper judicial\nenforcement of an agreed-upon undertaking and the imposition of requirements that\nfind no warrant in that undertaking, did not clearly err in finding that LRSD had failed\nto demonstrate substantial compliance with the Revised Plan and the 2002 Remedy.\n\n                                          B.\n       Our concerns regarding the 2002 Remedy are even greater with respect to the\neven more heightened requirements, as illustrated by the portions quoted above,\nimposed by the district court’s June 30, 2004, order. One can understand the\nfrustration expressed by LRSD concerning that which it is now expected to do.\nIndeed, during oral argument we asked LRSD’s counsel, “Can you tell us in plain,\nsimple language what it is that [the district court] wants the District to do that it is\nunwilling to do?” Counsel responded in part by saying that LRSD was complying\nwith the new compliance remedy. In light of that representation, we are unwilling at\nthis time to say that those heightened requirements surpass beyond all measure the\nrequirements to which LRSD committed itself when it entered into the 1989\nSettlement. Suffice it to say that there will be time enough for us to revisit the\nrequirements of the 2004 order if this case should once again come before us. For the\nmoment, then, we offer no comment beyond the observation that substantial\ncompliance means just that, not mathematical precision.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n       In the concluding paragraphs of its June 30, 2004, order under the heading\n“Final Thoughts on LRSD’s Compliance Efforts,” the district court, referring to its\nreview of the history of the negotiations that had led the parties to voluntarily enter\ninto the Revised Plan, stated:\n\n      I review this history to make it crystal clear that LRSD--not the Court--\n      formulated all of the program assessment/evaluation obligations\n      contained in § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan and voluntarily agreed to\n      comply with all of those obligations.\n\n             I know it will be quite a burden for LRSD to formulate,\n      implement, and deeply embed in its curriculum an effective § 2.7.1\n      program assessment/evaluation process that will allow it to determine the\n      effectiveness of each of the key § 2.7 programs. But this is the medicine\n      that LRSD knowingly and voluntarily decided it must take in an attempt\n      to cure the historically low academic achievement of so many of its\n      African-American students.\n\nD. Ct. Order at 67.\n\n       In commenting upon LRSD’s duty to ensure that a significant number of\nAfrican-American students score at or above the proficient level in reading, math, and\nscience, the district court concluded its remarks by stating, “To this end, LRSD must\ndo what it promised to do, and what it has been ordered to do because of this promise.\nIn the words of the poet of the Yukon, Robert Service, ‘a promise made is a debt\nunpaid.’” Id. at 68.\n\n      We add to these comments only the observation that a promise is that which has\nbeen made by the promisor, and not one that may be expanded by others beyond that\nwhich is fairly encompassed by its terms.\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f       Nothing in what we have said in this opinion should be read as in any way\nrelieving the Little Rock School District of its obligation to comply with the\ncommitments it made when it entered into the settlement that culminated in the\nRevised Plan. Our concerns about the district court’s 2002 and 2004 orders arise from\nthe ever-heightened requirements that the District is being asked to satisfy,\nrequirements that may seem to impose a duty of demonstrating mathematical precision\nat a cost and effort beyond that which the District should be required to bear.\n\n       We note that in one form or another the Little Rock School District has been\nunder judicial tutelage for more than two decades now. We hope that it is not too\nmuch to expect that its efforts to comply with not only the requirements of the Revised\nPlan but also with the subsequent embellishments of those requirements will prove\nto be successful.\n\n      With these observations, the judgment is affirmed.\n\nGRUENDER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n       Like the Court, I would affirm the district court’s finding that LRSD was not\nin substantial compliance with section 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan as embodied in the\n2002 Remedy. However, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment because I\nfind that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the 2004 Remedy.\n\n       A consent decree “is a kind of private law, agreed to by the parties and given\nshape over time through interpretation by the court that entered it.” Knote, 29 F.3d\nat 1300 (quoting Sennewald v. Univ. of Minnesota, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506254\"><a href=\"/opinion/506254/charlene-sennewald-v-university-of-minnesota-and-the-regents-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475 (8th Cir. 1988)\nR.

Although we defer in large measure to the district court’s\ninterpretation or modification of a consent decree, Knote, 29 F.3d at 1300, 1302, the\ndistrict court is not at liberty to ignore what was “agreed to by the parties” by\nimposing new terms that lie outside the intended agreement of the parties, see, e.g.,\n\n                                         -23-\n\fPure Country, Inc. v.

There is no dispute that the only\nhurdle remaining in LRSD’s quest for unitary status is compliance with subparts A\nand B of the 2002 Remedy. Therefore, the district court’s modification should have\nfocused on producing compliance with those terms. Subpart A required LRSD “to\nassess each of the programs implemented under § 2.7” for a year and a half and “to\nuse all of that available data and information [including other information already\navailable apart from the assessments] in assessing the effectiveness of those\nprograms.” Subpart B required LRSD to maintain written records of the assessments\ncontaining (a) the written criteria used to assess each program, (b) the results of the\nassessments, including any resulting modification or elimination of a program, and (c)\nthe names of administrators and grade-level descriptions of any teachers involved in\nthe assessment. Also as discussed by the Court, ante at 9-11, there was a clear\ndistinction in the 2002 Remedy between a less formal, dynamic “assessment” and a\nmore formal, research-paper-formatted “evaluation.”\n\n       Instead of focusing on enforcing compliance with the terms agreed to by the\nparties, however, the district court imposed terms in the 2004 Remedy that are\nuntethered to the requirements of subparts A and B of the 2002 Remedy or section\n\n                                          -24-\n\f2.7.1 of the Revised Plan. Although the district court’s substitution of eight in-depth\n“evaluations” for the agreed-upon “assessments” of each program was arguably\nsuggested in part by LRSD’s own prior attempt to substitute three broad evaluations\nfor the individual program assessments, there is no evidence of a meeting of the minds\nbetween the parties that would allow a number of in-depth evaluations to replace the\nagreed-upon assessments. Therefore, the district court should have simply enforced\nthe assessment requirement as originally set forth in subparts A and B of the 2002\nRemedy. The district court’s substitution of a new set of rigorous evaluations not\nagreed to by the parties was an abuse of discretion.\n\n       There are two other aspects of the 2004 Remedy that are even more significant\nabuses of discretion. First, the district court ordered LRSD to hire a new team for its\nProgram Review and Evaluation Department (“PRE”), and the district court specified\nin great detail the educational background and experience that the district court\nrequired of the new team. In addition, the district court all but ordered LRSD to hire\na particular expert, Dr. Ross (or a person chosen by Dr. Ross), to identify the eight\n“key” section 2.7 programs and prepare in-depth “step 2” evaluations of those\nprograms. Nothing in subparts A and B of the 2002 Remedy suggested that LRSD\nwould have to operate under such detailed personnel qualification requirements in\nassessing the section 2.7 programs. In settling this case, LRSD certainly did not\nconsent to the selection of its employees and consultants by the district court.\n\n        Second, the district court introduced a requirement that LRSD’s “program\nassessment process must be deeply embedded as a permanent part of LRSD’s\ncurriculum and instruction program” (emphasis by the district court). The district\ncourt did not identify any objective standards by which it intends to measure whether\nLRSD succeeds in meeting this “deeply embedded” requirement. The district court\njustified this requirement by stating, “Only then will I have the necessary assurance\nthat LRSD intends to continue using that process for as long as it is needed to\ndetermine the effectiveness” of LRSD’s programs in closing the achievement gap.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fHowever, the district court’s responsibility is to obtain the necessary assurance that\nLRSD is complying with the terms of the consent decree, not to independently assess\nwhether those terms are effective. The parties agreed to annual program assessments\nby administrators and teachers, not to a permanently embedded institutional structure\nof reviewing experts chosen by the district court.\n\n       The introduction of the impossibly subjective “deeply embedded” requirement,\nviewed in light of the district court’s lack of restraint to date in redefining the program\nassessment requirements in subparts A and B and micro-managing LRSD’s\ncompliance team, raises the specter that the district court intends to retain control of\nLRSD’s efforts to close the achievement gap regardless of whether LRSD meets the\nterms agreed to by the parties. No matter how much the district court believed that the\nnew terms in the 2004 Remedy would make an “improvement . . . in effectuating the\ndecree’s goal[]” of closing the achievement gap, a laudable motive, the district court\nsimply “may not replace the terms of a consent decree with its own.” New York\nTimes Co., 196 F.3d at 78 (quotation omitted). For these reasons, I would find that\nthe district court abused its discretion in imposing the 2004 Remedy.\n\n       Finally, I recognize that LRSD already has invested a substantial amount of the\neffort and expense needed to meet the requirements of the 2004 Remedy. At this\npoint, vacating the 2004 Remedy in its entirety and remanding to the district court to\nimpose a new remedy might actually set back LRSD’s efforts to attain unitary status.\nTherefore, I would instruct the district court to order LRSD to complete the eight “step\n2” evaluations as called for in the 2004 Remedy, but I would also instruct the district\ncourt to analyze those eight evaluations under the standards set forth in subparts A and\nB of the 2002 Remedy. Specifically, the evaluation reports individually would need\nto meet the standards of a “program assessment,” rather than an “evaluation,” as\ndefined ante at 9-10; LRSD would have to show that it used “all of th[e] available data\nand information in assessing the effectiveness of those programs” as required by\nsubpart A, meaning that the in-depth data gathered in the “step 2” evaluations would\n\n                                           -26-\n\fbe put to good use; and continued compliance with the written record requirements\nspecified in subpart B of the 2002 Remedy would supplant the unworkably subjective\n“deeply embedded” standard created out of whole cloth in the 2004 Remedy. The\ndetailed personnel requirements imposed on LRSD would be vacated. Such a\nmodification of the 2004 Remedy would restore the standards agreed to by the parties\nwithout disrupting the substantial compliance efforts LRSD has undertaken to date\nwith respect to that remedy.\n\n    Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision to uphold the 2004\nRemedy and would modify the 2004 Remedy as discussed.\n                       ___________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\f</pre>",
