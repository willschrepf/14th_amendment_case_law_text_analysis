By four issues, which can be properly\n\ncategorized as three, the District argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\n\njurisdiction because: (1) Garcia failed to allege jurisdictional facts vesting subject-matter\n\njurisdiction in the trial court; (2) Garcia’s lawsuit was not timely filed under the Texas\n\nCommission on Human Rights Act (“TCHRA”), see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254 (Vernon\n\n2006); and (3) the District is not an “employer” within the context of the TCHRA, and, thus,\n\nthere is no waiver of sovereign immunity. We affirm.\n\f                                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Initially, this case involved three terminated school-district employees—Garcia,\n\nMelinda Sotuyo, and Deborah Medina—who filed lawsuits against the District and its\n\nsuperintendent, H.F. “Jackie” Dyer, alleging violations of the TCHRA and various common-\n\nlaw claims.1 See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 166 S.W.3d 902, 903 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Corpus Christi 2005), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 253 S.W.3d 653 (Tex. 2008). The\n\nDistrict filed a plea to the jurisdiction in each case asserting immunity under section\n\n101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act, and the trial court denied the District’s pleas. See\n\nTEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 101.106 (Vernon 2005). On original submission to this\n\nCourt, we affirmed the trial court’s denial of the pleas, concluding that section 101.106 of\n\nthe Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to the underlying claims. See Garcia, 166 S.W.3d\n\nat 905.\n\n        On further appeal, the supreme court concluded that: (1) the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct’s election-of-remedies provision governs all lawsuits filed against a governmental unit;\n\n(2) the employees’ common-law claims against the District and the superintendent were\n\nbarred by the Texas Tort Claims Act’s election-of-remedies provision; and (3) the Texas\n\nTort Claims Act’s election scheme did not bar the employees’ recovery under the TCHRA\n\n“because the Legislature has consented to suits against the government under the TCHRA\n\n. . . and a suit that is based on the TCHRA is not one brought under the [Texas] Tort\n\nClaims Act.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 654, 660-61 (stating, in particular, that “[w]hile this\n\nCourt has not previously addressed the issue, all the courts of appeals that have\n\nconsidered it have concluded that the TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity,\n\nand we agree. . . . In this case . . . Garcia’s TCHRA claims against the ISD survive”).\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Garcia filed her original petition on July 2, 2004, asserting various wrongful term ination, defam ation,\nnegligent m isrepresentation, and fraudulent m isrepresentation claim s. The record does not contain\ninform ation regarding the status of Sotuyo’s and Medina’s lawsuits; however, they are not parties to this\nappeal. Furtherm ore, Garcia acknowledges on appeal that Dyer was dism issed from the underlying suit.\n\n                                                         2\n\f         On remand, the District filed another plea to the jurisdiction2 contending that: (1)\n\nGarcia failed to allege in her original petition jurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had\n\nbeen discriminated or retaliated against by the District; (2) Garcia failed to comply with the\n\nnotice provisions contained in the TCHRA, see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254; and (3) the\n\nDistrict is not an “employer” within the context of the TCHRA, and, therefore, the trial court\n\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Garcia’s claims. See id. § 21.002(8) (Vernon Supp.\n\n2009).       After a hearing, the trial court denied the District’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nThereafter, the District filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial\n\ncourt did not issue any fact findings or conclusions; this accelerated interlocutory appeal\n\nensued. See TEX . R. APP. P. 28.1; see also TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . §§\n\n51.014(a)(8) (Vernon 2008), 101.001(3)(B) (Vernon 2005).\n\n                                           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea used to defeat a cause of action without\n\nregard to whether the claims asserted have merit. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34\n\nS.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).                  The plea challenges the trial court’s subject-matter\n\njurisdiction. Id.; see Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Jones, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638 (Tex. 1999).\n\nWhether a trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction and whether the pleader has alleged\n\nfacts that affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction are questions\n\nof law that we review de novo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217,\n\n226 (Tex. 2004); Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855\n\n(Tex. 2002).\n\n         2\n           W e are com pelled to note that the District’s jurisdictional com plaints raised in the plea to the\njurisdiction at bar could have been raised in the initial plea to the jurisdiction filed in 2004. W hile there appears\nto be no prohibition on such a piecem eal approach, this practice should be discouraged because of the\ninevitable delay and additional expense. See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 10.001(1) (Vernon 2002)\n(providing, am ong other things, that “[t]he signing of a pleading or m otion . . . constitutes a certificate by the\nsignatory that to the signatory’s best knowledge, inform ation, and belief, form ed after reasonable inquiry . .\n. the pleading or m otion is not being presented for any im proper purpose, including to harass or to cause\nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation . . . ”) (em phasis added); see also Columbia\nMed. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue, 271 S.W .3d 238, 258 (Tex. 2008) (Brister, J., concurring) (quoting\nIley v. Hughes, 158 Tex. 362, 311 S.W .2d 648, 651 (1958) (“‘Our courts have always frowned upon piecem eal\ntrials, deem ing the public interest, the interests of litigants[,] and the adm inistration of justice to be better\nserved by rules of trial which avoid a m ultiplicity of suits.’”)); Transp. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W .2d 10, 30 n.29\n(Tex. 1994) (“[W ]e rem ain resolute that piecem eal trials as a general rule should be avoided . . . .”).\n\n                                                          3\n\f       The plaintiff has the burden to plead facts affirmatively showing that the trial court\n\nhas jurisdiction. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex.\n\n1993); Univ. of N. Tex. v. Harvey, 124 S.W.3d 216, 220 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 2003, pet.\n\ndenied). We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the pleader, look to the pleader’s\n\nintent, and accept as true the factual allegations in the pleadings. See Miranda, 133\n\nS.W.3d at 226, 228; City of Fort Worth v. Crockett, 142 S.W.3d 550, 552 (Tex. App.–Fort\n\nWorth 2004, pet. denied).       If a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary\n\nto resolve the jurisdictional issues raised, as the trial court is required to do, even those\n\nfacts which may implicate the merits of the cause of action. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227;\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d at 555 (confining evidentiary review to evidence that is relevant to the\n\njurisdictional issue); see City of Waco v. Kirwan, No. 08-0121, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6\n\n(Tex. Nov. 20, 2009).\n\n       A trial court’s review of a plea to the jurisdiction challenging the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts mirrors that of a traditional motion for summary judgment. Miranda, 133\n\nS.W.3d at 228; see TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(c). The governmental unit is required to meet the\n\nsummary judgment standard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction.\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228. Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff\n\nis then required to show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\n\nissue. Id. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must\n\ndeny the plea to the jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the fact finder. Id. at 227-28.\n\nBut, if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue,\n\nthe trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law. Id. at 228.\n\n       “In considering this evidence, we ‘take as true all evidence favorable to the\n\nnonmovant’ and ‘indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\n\nnonmovant’s favor.’” Kirwan, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6 (quoting Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\nat 228). Further, a defendant cannot simply deny the existence of jurisdictional facts and\n\n\n                                               4\n\fforce the plaintiff to raise a fact issue. See Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C., 73\n\nS.W.3d 193, 207 (Tex. 2002); see also County of Cameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555\n\n(Tex. 2002) (“In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, a court may not weigh the claims’ merits\n\nbut must consider only the plaintiffs’ pleadings and evidence pertinent to the jurisdictional\n\ninquiry.”).\n\n                                         III. ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Whether Garcia’s Original Petition Contained Sufficient Jurisdictional Facts\n\n       In its first issue, the District contends that Garcia failed to allege in her original\n\npetition sufficient jurisdictional facts to make out a prima facie case of discrimination or\n\nretaliation. Garcia counters that the pleadings sufficiently invoke the subject-matter\n\njurisdiction of the trial court. Garcia further argues that the trial court’s denial of the\n\nDistrict’s plea to the jurisdiction was proper because the District is attempting to resolve the\n\nunderlying merits of the case, which is an inappropriate use of a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n       1.     Applicable Law\n\n       The TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051 (Vernon 2006).\n\nSpecifically, section 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n       discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\n       compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n              (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n       employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\n       of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\n       status of an employee.\n\nId. The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who: “(1) opposes discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files\n\na complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation,\n\nproceeding, or hearing.” Id. § 21.055 (Vernon 2006). Because one of the purposes of the\n\n                                               5\n\fTCHRA is to correlate state law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination,\n\nwe may look to federal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA. See id. § 21.001\n\n(Vernon 2006); see also M.D. Anderson Hosp. v. Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 24\n\n(Tex. 2000); NME Hosps., Inc. v. Rennels, 994 S.W.2d 142, 144 (Tex. 1999).\n\n       2.      Discussion\n\n       In her original petition, Garcia noted that she first began working for the District in\n\nOctober 1976, and “performed all the duties assigned to her with loyalty, dedication[,] and\n\nhard work.” However, on or about February 19, 2003, she was “wrongfully discharged by\n\na management employee of Defendant [the District] for illegal and discriminatory reasons,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, participating in an investigation involving another district\n\nemployee . . . and for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.” Garcia\n\nfurther alleged that “she was discriminated against by the Defendant School District due\n\nto her race and national origin, namely—Hispanic/Mexican-American descent,\n\ngender—female, and due to her age, 48 (d.o.b.—06/15/1954)” and that “her termination\n\nwas part of a larger unwritten plan or scheme of the Defendant School District to\n\ndiscriminate against older Hispanic female employees who were politically associated with\n\npersons adverse to the Administration.” Garcia also stated that “there was no legitimate\n\nbusiness justification for her termination” because she “had always performed a\n\nsatisfactory job for the Defendant during her employment . . . and that there was work\n\navailable and there continues to be work available which [Garcia] could perform” and that\n\nshe had fulfilled all statutory prerequisites before filing this action.\n\n       In response to Garcia’s original petition, the District filed a plea to the jurisdiction,\n\nwhich the trial court denied.       The District contended that Garcia failed to allege\n\njurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had been discriminated or retaliated against by\n\nthe District. Specifically, the District argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over Garcia’s discrimination claims because the employee selected to replace\n\nGarcia is of the same gender, national origin, and race and is three years older than\n\nGarcia.     The District further argued that the trial court did not have subject-matter\n\n                                               6\n\fjurisdiction over Garcia’s retaliation claim because she “did not participate in an\n\ninvestigation related to a claim brought pursuant to Chapter 21 [of the labor code].”\n\n        At the hearing on the District’s plea to the jurisdiction, two affidavits were admitted\n\nas part of the District’s evidence. The first affidavit was executed by Dr. Rebecca Morrison,\n\nthe Director of Human Resources for the District, which averred that: (1) Dr. Morrison had\n\nreviewed Garcia’s employment records; (2) Garcia had served as “one of two\n\nCommunity/Home School Liaisons for Veterans Memorial High School”; and (3) the next\n\nperson hired to fill Garcia’s position was Zoila Longoria. The second affidavit, executed\n\nby Longoria, provided the following personal information pertaining to Longoria: (1) her\n\nbirthday is April 14, 1951; (2) she is Hispanic; (3) she is a female; and (4) her national\n\norigin is Mexican-American. Beyond its bare assertions at the hearing on the plea to the\n\njurisdiction, the District did not present any evidence addressing Garcia’s retaliation claim.\n\n        We find that the evidence submitted by the District merely attacks the merits of\n\nGarcia’s underlying causes of action and does not defeat subject-matter jurisdiction. See\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228 (“We adhere to the fundamental precept that a court must not\n\nproceed on the merits of a case until legitimate challenges to its jurisdiction have been\n\ndecided. . . .      However, by reserving for the fact finder the resolution of disputed\n\njurisdictional facts that implicate the merits of the claim or defense, we preserve the parties’\n\nright to present the merits of their case at trial.”); see also Brown, 80 S.W.3d at 555.\n\nAccepting as true the factual allegations made by Garcia in her original petition, taking as\n\ntrue all evidence favorable to Garcia, and indulging every reasonable inference and\n\nresolving any doubts in Garcia’s favor, we conclude that Garcia has pleaded sufficient facts\n\ndemonstrating that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute, and\n\ntherefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred in denying the District’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction.3 See Kirwan, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226, 228;\n\n\n        3\n          Our conclusion is further supported by the suprem e court’s determ ination that the District is not\nim m une from suit within the context of the TCHRA. See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. D ist. v. Garcia, 253\nS.W .3d 653, 660 (Tex. 2008); see also Tex. Dep’t of Parks & W ildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W .3d 217, 224 (Tex.\n2004) (holding that im m unity from suit deprives a court of subject-m atter jurisdiction); Sweeny Cmty. Hosp.\n\n                                                      7\n\fsee also Crockett, 142 S.W.3d at 552. Accordingly, we overrule the District’s first issue.\n\nB.      Whether Garcia Complied With Section 21.254 of the Labor Code\n\n        By its second issue, the District asserts that Garcia failed to comply with the\n\nmandatory and jurisdictional notice requirements contained in the TCHRA. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE ANN . § 21.254. Garcia contends that she filed suit within the sixty-day deadline\n\nimposed by the TCHRA and that she exercised due diligence in serving the District with\n\nnotice of her lawsuit.\n\n        The labor code establishes two timelines with which an aggrieved employee must\n\ncomply. First, an employee must file an administrative complaint within 180 days of any\n\nalleged discriminatory acts. See id. § 21.202(a) (Vernon 2006); Rice v. Russell-Stanley,\n\nL.P., 131 S.W.3d 510, 513 (Tex. App.–Waco 2004, pet. denied); see also Schroeder v.\n\nTex. Iron Works, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 483, 485-86 (Tex. 1991).                       This requirement is\n\n“mandatory and jurisdictional”; thus, “failing to comply deprives the court of subject[-]matter\n\njurisdiction.” Schroeder, 813 S.W.2d at 486; Czerwinski v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr.,\n\n116 S.W.3d 119, 121 (Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied); see Vela v.\n\nWaco Indep. Sch. Dist., 69 S.W.3d 695, 700 (Tex. App.–Waco 2002, pet. withdrawn).\n\nWhether Garcia complied with this timeline is not in dispute in this case.\n\n        Second, the employee must file suit within sixty days of receiving a right-to-sue letter\n\nfrom the administrative agency. See Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 699; see also TEX . LAB. CODE\n\nANN . § 21.254. The Texas Supreme Court has not addressed whether the sixty-day filing\n\nperiod is jurisdictional. See Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice v. Guard, No. 10-06-00065-CV,\n\n2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 2859, at **7-8 (Tex. App.–Waco Apr. 11, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nSeveral of our sister courts, however, have concluded that the sixty-day filing period is not\n\njurisdictional. See id. at **9-10 (citing Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Beckner, 74 S.W.3d 98, 103\n\n(Tex. App.–Waco 2002, no pet.); Middleton v. Gould, 952 F. Supp. 435, 438 (S.D. Tex.\n\n1996); Corner v. Gates of Cedar Hill, No. 3-00-CV-2499-N, 2002 U.S. Dist.

See\n\nBeckner, 74 S.W.3d at 103 (holding that the forty-day filing period in a workers’\n\ncompensation case is a limitations period and not a jurisdiction bar and stating that\n\n“statutory requirements are not ‘jurisdictional’ merely because they impose a mandatory\n\nrequirement on the plaintiff before judicial relief may be sought”); see also Guard, 2007\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 2859, at **7-9 (holding that “Chapter 21's 60-day filing period is not\n\njurisdictional” and “a filing period is not an act that must be performed prior to filing suit and\n\nso is not a statutory prerequisite” (emphasis in original)); Windle, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS\n\n5594, at *4. Because we have concluded that the sixty-day filing period is not jurisdictional,\n\nit cannot serve as the proper basis for a plea to the jurisdiction, and therefore, we cannot\n\naddress it on interlocutory appeal.4 See Tex. Educ. Agency v. Donna Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n\n           4\n             The District argues that Garcia’s alleged failure to notify the District of her suit within the sixty-day\nfiling period deprived the trial court of subject-m atter jurisdiction, considering section 311.034 of the\ngovernm ent code provides that “[s]tatutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\njurisdictional requirem ents in all suits against a governm ental entity.” See T EX . G O V ’T C OD E A N N . § 311.034\n(Vernon Supp. 2009). However, the language referenced by the District was not included in the version of\nsection 311.034 that was in effect when Garcia filed suit on July 2, 2004. See Act of June 15, 2001, 77th Leg.,\nR.S., ch. 1158, § 8, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 2374, 2433 (am ended 2005) (current version at T EX . G O V ’T C O DE\nA N N . § 311.034). In fact, the predecessor to section 311.034 provided the following:\n\n         Sec. 311.034 W AIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY\n\n         In order to preserve the legislature’s interest in managing state fiscal m atters through the\n         appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign im m unity\n         unless the waiver is effected by clear and unam biguous language. In a statute, the use of\n         “person” as defined by Section 311.005 to include governm ental entities does not indicate\n         legislative intent to waive sovereign im m unity unless the context of the statute indicates no\n         other reasonable construction.\n\nId. Because the predecessor to section 311.034 is silent as to statutory prerequisites and jurisdictional\n\n                                                          9\n\f221 S.W.3d 791, 796 n.3 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2007, no pet.) (“The proper avenue\n\nfor raising the statute of limitations is a motion for summary judgment—not a plea to the\n\njurisdiction”); Instrument Specialities Co. v. Tex. Employment Comm’n, 924 S.W.2d 420,\n\n421 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, writ denied) (raising service issue by motion for summary\n\njudgment); see also Guard, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 2859, at *9 (citing Cozby v. City of\n\nWaco, 110 S.W.3d 32, 35 (Tex. App.–Waco 2002, no pet.)). Accordingly, we overrule the\n\nDistrict’s second issue.\n\nC.      Whether the District is an “Employer” Within the Context of Chapter 21 of the\n        Labor Code\n\n        In its third issue, the District argues that it is not subject to the waiver of immunity\n\ncontained in chapter 21 of the labor code because it is a school district and not an\n\n“employer.” See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.002(8).\n\n        On original submission, the Texas Supreme Court held that immunity is waived as\n\nto a school district under chapter 21 of the labor code. See Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660;\n\nsee also Copperas Cove Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Brown, No. 10-09-00047-CV, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 9814, at **1-2 (Tex. App.–Waco Dec. 30, 2009, no pet h.) (mem. op.) (rejecting a\n\nschool district’s argument that school districts are not “employers” as defined by Chapter\n\n21, and therefore, immunity is not waived). On appeal, the District essentially asks us to\n\nreconsider the supreme court’s resolution of this issue.\n\n        We first note that the “law of the case” doctrine requires that “questions of law\n\ndecided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent\n\nstages.” Hudson v. Wakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630 (Tex. 1986). Furthermore, this Court\n\nis bound to follow the supreme court’s resolution of this issue. See Lubbock County v.\n\nTrammel’s Lubbock Bail Bonds, 80 S.W.3d 580, 585 (Tex. 2002) (“It is not the function of\n\na court of appeals to abrogate or modify established precedent. . . . That function lies\n\nsolely with this Court. . . . Generally, the doctrine of stare decisis dictates that once the\n\nSupreme Court announces a proposition of law, the decision is considered binding\n\n\nrequirem ents, we do not consider the District’s argum ent to be persuasive.\n\n                                                    10\n\fprecedent.”).\n\n         The District argues that Garcia is not the “law of the case” because the specific\n\nissue of whether a school district is immune under the TCHRA was never fully briefed or\n\nargued. It further argues that the supreme court’s more recent decision in Harris County\n\nHospital District v. Tomball Regional Hospital calls Garcia into question. See 283 S.W.3d\n\n838 (Tex. 2009). We are unpersuaded by these arguments. Notwithstanding the lack of\n\nbriefing or argument, the supreme court considered the waiver issue5 and concluded that\n\nthe “TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660.\n\nThus, we must conclude that the definition of “employer” in chapter 21 of the labor code\n\nincludes school districts, and therefore, immunity is waived.6 Accordingly, we overrule the\n\nDistrict’s third issue.\n\n                                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         Having overruled all of the District’s issues on appeal, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ntrial court.\n\n\n\n                                                                  DORI CONTRERAS GARZA,\n                                                                  Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n28th day of January, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          “Here, Garcia alleges that the Legislature waived the ISD’s im m unity in the TCHRA.” Garcia, 253\nS.W .3d at 660.\n          6\n            W e also note that the District, in arguing that it is not an “em ployer” within the context of Chapter 21\nof the labor code, argues that it is neither a “political subdivision” of the State of Texas nor a “state\ninstrum entality.” If this were true, then, in reconciling chapter 21 of the labor code with section 51.014 of the\ncivil practice and rem edies code (the statute authorizing certain interlocutory appeals), the District would not\nbe entitled to appeal the trial court’s interlocutory order in this case.

By four issues, which can be properly\n\ncategorized as three, the District argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\n\njurisdiction because: (1) Garcia failed to allege jurisdictional facts vesting subject-matter\n\njurisdiction in the trial court; (2) Garcia’s lawsuit was not timely filed under the Texas\n\nCommission on Human Rights Act (“TCHRA”), see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254 (Vernon\n\n2006); and (3) the District is not an “employer” within the context of the TCHRA, and, thus,\n\nthere is no waiver of sovereign immunity. We affirm.\n\f                                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Initially, this case involved three terminated school-district employees—Garcia,\n\nMelinda Sotuyo, and Deborah Medina—who filed lawsuits against the District and its\n\nsuperintendent, H.F. “Jackie” Dyer, alleging violations of the TCHRA and various common-\n\nlaw claims.1 See Mission Consol.

The\n\nDistrict filed a plea to the jurisdiction in each case asserting immunity under section\n\n101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act, and the trial court denied the District’s pleas. See\n\nTEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 101.106 (Vernon 2005). On original submission to this\n\nCourt, we affirmed the trial court’s denial of the pleas, concluding that section 101.106 of\n\nthe Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to the underlying claims. See Garcia, 166 S.W.3d\n\nat 905.\n\n        On further appeal, the supreme court concluded that: (1) the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct’s election-of-remedies provision governs all lawsuits filed against a governmental unit;\n\n(2) the employees’ common-law claims against the District and the superintendent were\n\nbarred by the Texas Tort Claims Act’s election-of-remedies provision; and (3) the Texas\n\nTort Claims Act’s election scheme did not bar the employees’ recovery under the TCHRA\n\n“because the Legislature has consented to suits against the government under the TCHRA\n\n. . . and a suit that is based on the TCHRA is not one brought under the [Texas] Tort\n\nClaims Act.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 654, 660-61 (stating, in particular, that “[w]hile this\n\nCourt has not previously addressed the issue, all the courts of appeals that have\n\nconsidered it have concluded that the TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity,\n\nand we agree. . . . In this case . . . Garcia’s TCHRA claims against the ISD survive”).\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Garcia filed her original petition on July 2, 2004, asserting various wrongful term ination, defam ation,\nnegligent m isrepresentation, and fraudulent m isrepresentation claim s. The record does not contain\ninform ation regarding the status of Sotuyo’s and Medina’s lawsuits; however, they are not parties to this\nappeal. Furtherm ore, Garcia acknowledges on appeal that Dyer was dism issed from the underlying suit.\n\n                                                         2\n\f         On remand, the District filed another plea to the jurisdiction2 contending that: (1)\n\nGarcia failed to allege in her original petition jurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had\n\nbeen discriminated or retaliated against by the District; (2) Garcia failed to comply with the\n\nnotice provisions contained in the TCHRA, see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254; and (3) the\n\nDistrict is not an “employer” within the context of the TCHRA, and, therefore, the trial court\n\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Garcia’s claims. See id. § 21.002(8) (Vernon Supp.\n\n2009).       After a hearing, the trial court denied the District’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nThereafter, the District filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial\n\ncourt did not issue any fact findings or conclusions; this accelerated interlocutory appeal\n\nensued. See TEX . R. APP. P. 28.1; see also TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM .

The governmental unit is required to meet the\n\nsummary judgment standard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction.\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228. Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff\n\nis then required to show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\n\nissue. Id. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must\n\ndeny the plea to the jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the fact finder. Id. at 227-28.\n\nBut, if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue,\n\nthe trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law.

ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Whether Garcia’s Original Petition Contained Sufficient Jurisdictional Facts\n\n       In its first issue, the District contends that Garcia failed to allege in her original\n\npetition sufficient jurisdictional facts to make out a prima facie case of discrimination or\n\nretaliation. Garcia counters that the pleadings sufficiently invoke the subject-matter\n\njurisdiction of the trial court. Garcia further argues that the trial court’s denial of the\n\nDistrict’s plea to the jurisdiction was proper because the District is attempting to resolve the\n\nunderlying merits of the case, which is an inappropriate use of a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n       1.     Applicable Law\n\n       The TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051 (Vernon 2006).\n\nSpecifically, section 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n       discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\n       compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n              (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n       employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\n       of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\n       status of an employee.\n\nId. The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who: “(1) opposes discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files\n\na complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation,\n\nproceeding, or hearing.” Id. § 21.055 (Vernon 2006). Because one of the purposes of the\n\n                                               5\n\fTCHRA is to correlate state law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination,\n\nwe may look to federal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA. See id. § 21.001\n\n(Vernon 2006); see also M.D. Anderson Hosp. v. Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755090/md-anderson-hosp-tumor-inst-v-willrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24\n\n(Tex. 2000); NME Hosps., Inc. v.

Discussion\n\n       In her original petition, Garcia noted that she first began working for the District in\n\nOctober 1976, and “performed all the duties assigned to her with loyalty, dedication[,] and\n\nhard work.” However, on or about February 19, 2003, she was “wrongfully discharged by\n\na management employee of Defendant [the District] for illegal and discriminatory reasons,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, participating in an investigation involving another district\n\nemployee . . . and for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.” Garcia\n\nfurther alleged that “she was discriminated against by the Defendant School District due\n\nto her race and national origin, namely—Hispanic/Mexican-American descent,\n\ngender—female, and due to her age, 48 (d.o.b.—06/15/1954)” and that “her termination\n\nwas part of a larger unwritten plan or scheme of the Defendant School District to\n\ndiscriminate against older Hispanic female employees who were politically associated with\n\npersons adverse to the Administration.” Garcia also stated that “there was no legitimate\n\nbusiness justification for her termination” because she “had always performed a\n\nsatisfactory job for the Defendant during her employment . . . and that there was work\n\navailable and there continues to be work available which [Garcia] could perform” and that\n\nshe had fulfilled all statutory prerequisites before filing this action.\n\n       In response to Garcia’s original petition, the District filed a plea to the jurisdiction,\n\nwhich the trial court denied.       The District contended that Garcia failed to allege\n\njurisdictional facts demonstrating that she had been discriminated or retaliated against by\n\nthe District. Specifically, the District argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over Garcia’s discrimination claims because the employee selected to replace\n\nGarcia is of the same gender, national origin, and race and is three years older than\n\nGarcia.     The District further argued that the trial court did not have subject-matter\n\n                                               6\n\fjurisdiction over Garcia’s retaliation claim because she “did not participate in an\n\ninvestigation related to a claim brought pursuant to Chapter 21 [of the labor code].”\n\n        At the hearing on the District’s plea to the jurisdiction, two affidavits were admitted\n\nas part of the District’s evidence. The first affidavit was executed by Dr. Rebecca Morrison,\n\nthe Director of Human Resources for the District, which averred that: (1) Dr. Morrison had\n\nreviewed Garcia’s employment records; (2) Garcia had served as “one of two\n\nCommunity/Home School Liaisons for Veterans Memorial High School”; and (3) the next\n\nperson hired to fill Garcia’s position was Zoila Longoria. The second affidavit, executed\n\nby Longoria, provided the following personal information pertaining to Longoria: (1) her\n\nbirthday is April 14, 1951; (2) she is Hispanic; (3) she is a female; and (4) her national\n\norigin is Mexican-American. Beyond its bare assertions at the hearing on the plea to the\n\njurisdiction, the District did not present any evidence addressing Garcia’s retaliation claim.\n\n        We find that the evidence submitted by the District merely attacks the merits of\n\nGarcia’s underlying causes of action and does not defeat subject-matter jurisdiction. See\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228 (“We adhere to the fundamental precept that a court must not\n\nproceed on the merits of a case until legitimate challenges to its jurisdiction have been\n\ndecided. . . .      However, by reserving for the fact finder the resolution of disputed\n\njurisdictional facts that implicate the merits of the claim or defense, we preserve the parties’\n\nright to present the merits of their case at trial.”); see also Brown, 80 S.W.3d at 555.\n\nAccepting as true the factual allegations made by Garcia in her original petition, taking as\n\ntrue all evidence favorable to Garcia, and indulging every reasonable inference and\n\nresolving any doubts in Garcia’s favor, we conclude that Garcia has pleaded sufficient facts\n\ndemonstrating that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute, and\n\ntherefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred in denying the District’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction.3 See Kirwan, 2009 Tex. LEXIS 969, at *6; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226, 228;\n\n\n        3\n          Our conclusion is further supported by the suprem e court’s determ ination that the District is not\nim m une from suit within the context of the TCHRA. See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. D ist. v. Garcia, 253\nS.W .3d 653, 660 (Tex. 2008); see also Tex. Dep’t of Parks & W ildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W .3d 217, 224 (Tex.\n2004) (holding that im m unity from suit deprives a court of subject-m atter jurisdiction); Sweeny Cmty. Hosp.\n\n                                                      7\n\fsee also Crockett, 142 S.W.3d at 552. Accordingly, we overrule the District’s first issue.\n\nB.      Whether Garcia Complied With Section 21.254 of the Labor Code\n\n        By its second issue, the District asserts that Garcia failed to comply with the\n\nmandatory and jurisdictional notice requirements contained in the TCHRA. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE ANN . § 21.254. Garcia contends that she filed suit within the sixty-day deadline\n\nimposed by the TCHRA and that she exercised due diligence in serving the District with\n\nnotice of her lawsuit.\n\n        The labor code establishes two timelines with which an aggrieved employee must\n\ncomply. First, an employee must file an administrative complaint within 180 days of any\n\nalleged discriminatory acts. See id. § 21.202(a) (Vernon 2006); Rice v. Russell-Stanley,\n\nL.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1880013\"><a href=\"/opinion/1880013/rice-v-russell-stanley-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (Tex.

See Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 699; see also TEX . LAB. CODE\n\nANN . § 21.254. The Texas Supreme Court has not addressed whether the sixty-day filing\n\nperiod is jurisdictional. See Tex.

See\n\nBeckner, 74 S.W.3d at 103 (holding that the forty-day filing period in a workers’\n\ncompensation case is a limitations period and not a jurisdiction bar and stating that\n\n“statutory requirements are not ‘jurisdictional’ merely because they impose a mandatory\n\nrequirement on the plaintiff before judicial relief may be sought”); see also Guard, 2007\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 2859, at **7-9 (holding that “Chapter 21's 60-day filing period is not\n\njurisdictional” and “a filing period is not an act that must be performed prior to filing suit and\n\nso is not a statutory prerequisite” (emphasis in original)); Windle, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS\n\n5594, at *4. Because we have concluded that the sixty-day filing period is not jurisdictional,\n\nit cannot serve as the proper basis for a plea to the jurisdiction, and therefore, we cannot\n\naddress it on interlocutory appeal.4 See Tex. Educ. Agency v. Donna Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n\n           4\n             The District argues that Garcia’s alleged failure to notify the District of her suit within the sixty-day\nfiling period deprived the trial court of subject-m atter jurisdiction, considering section 311.034 of the\ngovernm ent code provides that “[s]tatutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\njurisdictional requirem ents in all suits against a governm ental entity.” See T EX . G O V ’T C OD E A N N . § 311.034\n(Vernon Supp. 2009). However, the language referenced by the District was not included in the version of\nsection 311.034 that was in effect when Garcia filed suit on July 2, 2004. See Act of June 15, 2001, 77th Leg.,\nR.S., ch. 1158, § 8, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 2374, 2433 (am ended 2005) (current version at T EX . G O V ’T C O DE\nA N N . § 311.034). In fact, the predecessor to section 311.034 provided the following:\n\n         Sec. 311.034 W AIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY\n\n         In order to preserve the legislature’s interest in managing state fiscal m atters through the\n         appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign im m unity\n         unless the waiver is effected by clear and unam biguous language. In a statute, the use of\n         “person” as defined by Section 311.005 to include governm ental entities does not indicate\n         legislative intent to waive sovereign im m unity unless the context of the statute indicates no\n         other reasonable construction.\n\nId.

Whether the District is an “Employer” Within the Context of Chapter 21 of the\n        Labor Code\n\n        In its third issue, the District argues that it is not subject to the waiver of immunity\n\ncontained in chapter 21 of the labor code because it is a school district and not an\n\n“employer.” See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.002(8).\n\n        On original submission, the Texas Supreme Court held that immunity is waived as\n\nto a school district under chapter 21 of the labor code. See Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660;\n\nsee also Copperas Cove Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Brown, No. 10-09-00047-CV, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 9814, at **1-2 (Tex. App.–Waco Dec. 30, 2009, no pet h.) (mem. op.) (rejecting a\n\nschool district’s argument that school districts are not “employers” as defined by Chapter\n\n21, and therefore, immunity is not waived). On appeal, the District essentially asks us to\n\nreconsider the supreme court’s resolution of this issue.\n\n        We first note that the “law of the case” doctrine requires that “questions of law\n\ndecided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent\n\nstages.” Hudson v.
