The plaintiff  class comprises  all present,\r<br>\r<br>            future, and  potential  Brown University  women students  who\r<br>\r<br>            participate, seek  to participate, and/or  are deterred  from\r<br>\r<br>            participating in intercollegiate athletics funded by Brown.\r<br>\r<br>                      This suit was initiated in response to the demotion\r<br>\r<br>            in  May 1991  of  Brown's women's  gymnastics and  volleyball\r<br>\r<br>            teams  from university-funded varsity  status to donor-funded\r<br>\r<br>            varsity status.

As a consequence  of these demotions,\r<br>\r<br>            all four teams lost,  not only their university funding,  but\r<br>\r<br>            most of the support and privileges that accompany university-\r<br>\r<br>            funded varsity status at Brown.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Prior  to the trial on the merits that gave rise to\r<br>\r<br>            this appeal, the  district court  granted plaintiffs'  motion\r<br>\r<br>            for class  certification  and denied  defendants'  motion  to\r<br>\r<br>            dismiss.    Subsequently,  after  hearing  fourteen  days  of\r<br>\r<br>            testimony,  the district court granted plaintiffs' motion for\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            a  preliminary  injunction, ordering,  inter  alia,  that the\r                                                   _____  ____\r<br>\r<br>            women's gymnastics  and  volleyball teams  be  reinstated  to\r<br>\r<br>            university-funded varsity status,  and prohibiting Brown from\r<br>\r<br>            eliminating or reducing the status or funding of any existing\r<br>\r<br>            women's  intercollegiate varsity  team  until  the  case  was\r<br>\r<br>            resolved on the merits.

This\r<br>\r<br>            appeal followed.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  claims error in  certain evidentiary rulings\r<br>\r<br>            made  during the trial and  in the district  court's order of\r<br>\r<br>            specific relief in place of Brown's proposed compliance plan.\r<br>\r<br>            In addition, and as in  the previous appeal, Brown challenges\r<br>\r<br>            on constitutional and statutory  grounds the test employed by\r<br>\r<br>            the   district   court   in   determining   whether   Brown's\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.  In\r<br>\r<br>            the  first  appeal, a  panel  of  this  court elucidated  the\r<br>\r<br>            applicable legal  framework, upholding the  substance of  the\r<br>\r<br>            district court's interpretation and application of the law in\r<br>\r<br>            granting  plaintiffs' motion  for a  preliminary injunction,1\r<br>\r<br>            and  rejecting essentially  the  same  legal arguments  Brown\r<br>\r<br>            makes here.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown contends  that we  are free to  disregard the\r<br>\r<br>            prior  panel's explication of the  law in Cohen  II.

While\r<br>\r<br>            we acknowledge that the  law of the case doctrine  is subject\r<br>\r<br>            to  exceptions, we conclude that none  applies here, and that\r<br>\r<br>            the  decision rendered by the prior panel in the first appeal\r<br>\r<br>            is not,  as Brown claims, \"legally  defective.\"  Accordingly,\r<br>\r<br>            we decline Brown's invitation  to undertake plenary review of\r<br>\r<br>            issues decided in the  previous appeal and treat Cohen  II as\r                                                             _________\r<br>\r<br>            controlling authority, dispositive of  the core issues raised\r<br>\r<br>            here.  \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            1.  The prior  panel upheld  the district court's  rulings in\r<br>            all respects save one.  We held that the district court erred\r<br>            in placing upon Brown  the burden of proof under  prong three\r<br>            of  the   three-part  test  used  to   determine  whether  an\r<br>            intercollegiate athletics  program  complies with  Title  IX,\r<br>            discussed infra.

Both  doctrines reflect  concerns that  have long\r<br>            been recognized as fundamentally important to the rule of law\r<br>            -- e.g., stability, predictability, and respect  for judicial\r<br>            authority --  and both doctrines  are applied  \"with more  or\r<br>            less rigidity depending on which interest is served.\"  Id. at\r                                                                   ___\r<br>            II-2.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          developed record.  In  this case, however, the record  before the\r<br>\r<br>          prior panel  was \"sufficiently developed and  the facts necessary\r<br>\r<br>          to  shape the  proper  legal matrix  [we]re sufficiently  clear,\"\r<br>\r<br>          Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 904, and nothing in the record subsequently\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>          developed  at trial constitutes  substantially different evidence\r<br>\r<br>          that might undermine the validity of the prior panel's rulings of\r<br>\r<br>          law.

Indeed, Brown\r                     ________\r<br>\r<br>          argues  as if  the  prior  panel  had  not  decided  the  precise\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  interpretation questions  presented (which  it clearly\r<br>\r<br>          did)  and  as if  the  district court's  liability  analysis were\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          contrary  to the law enunciated in  Cohen II (which it clearly is\r                                              ________\r<br>\r<br>          not).   Finding Brown's  bare assertions to  be unpersuasive,  we\r<br>\r<br>          decline the invitation  to this court to \"change its  mind.\"  The\r<br>\r<br>          precedent  established   by  the  prior  panel   is  not  clearly\r<br>\r<br>          erroneous; it  is  the law  of  this case  and  the law  of  this\r<br>\r<br>          circuit. \r<br>\r<br>                                         IV.\r                                         IV.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  contends that the  district court misconstrued\r<br>\r<br>          and misapplied  the three-part test.   Specifically, Brown argues\r<br>\r<br>          that the  district court's interpretation and  application of the\r<br>\r<br>          test  is irreconcilable with the statute, the regulation, and the\r<br>\r<br>          agency's interpretation of the law, and effectively renders Title\r<br>\r<br>          IX  an \"affirmative  action statute\"  that mandates  preferential\r<br>\r<br>          treatment  for women  by  imposing quotas  in  excess of  women's\r<br>\r<br>          relative interests and abilities in athletics.  Brown asserts, in\r<br>\r<br>          the alternative,  that if  the district court  properly construed\r<br>\r<br>          the test, then the  test itself violates Title IX and  the United\r<br>\r<br>          States Constitution.\r<br>\r<br>                      We  emphasize  two  points  at the  outset.    First,\r<br>\r<br>          notwithstanding Brown's persistent invocation of the inflammatory\r<br>\r<br>          terms \"affirmative  action,\" \"preference,\"  and \"quota,\"  this is\r<br>\r<br>          not an affirmative action case.  Second, Brown's efforts to evade\r<br>\r<br>          the controlling authority of Cohen II by recasting its core legal\r                                       ________\r<br>\r<br>          arguments as challenges to the \"district court's  interpretation\"\r<br>\r<br>          of the law are unavailing; the primary arguments raised here have\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -27-\r                                         -27-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          already  been  litigated and  decided adversely  to Brown  in the\r<br>\r<br>          prior appeal.  \r<br>\r<br>                                          A.\r                                          A.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown's   talismanic   incantation  of   \"affirmative\r<br>\r<br>          action\" has no  legal application to this case and is not helpful\r<br>\r<br>          to Brown's cause.  While \"affirmative action\" may  have different\r<br>\r<br>          connotations  as a matter  of politics, as  a matter of  law, its\r<br>\r<br>          meaning  is more  circumscribed.   True affirmative  action cases\r<br>\r<br>          have  historically involved a  voluntary10 undertaking  to remedy\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination  (as in  a program  implemented by  a governmental\r<br>\r<br>          body,  or  by a  private employer  or  institution), by  means of\r<br>\r<br>          specific  group-based  preferences  or  numerical  goals,  and  a\r<br>\r<br>          specific timetable  for achieving those goals.

Here,  gender-conscious  relief  was\r<br>\r<br>          ordered by  an Article  III court, constitutionally  compelled to\r<br>\r<br>          have  before it  litigants with  standing to  raise the  cause of\r<br>\r<br>          action alleged; for the  purpose of providing relief upon  a duly\r<br>\r<br>          adjudicated   determination   that   specific    defendants   had\r<br>\r<br>          discriminated  against a certified class of women in violation of\r<br>\r<br>          a  federal anti-discrimination  statute; based  upon  findings of\r<br>\r<br>          fact  that were  subject to the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.  The\r<br>\r<br>          factual problem  presented in affirmative action  cases is, \"Does\r<br>\r<br>          the evidence support a finding of discrimination such  that race-\r<br>\r<br>          or gender-conscious remedial measures  are appropriate?\"  We find\r<br>\r<br>          these  multiple  indicia of  reliability  and  specificity to  be\r<br>\r<br>          sufficient to answer that question in the affirmative.\r<br>\r<br>                      From  the  mere fact  that  a remedy  flowing  from a\r<br>\r<br>          judicial determination of discrimination is  gender-conscious, it\r<br>\r<br>          does not follow that the remedy constitutes \"affirmative action.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Nor  does a  \"reverse discrimination\" claim  arise every  time an\r<br>\r<br>          anti-discrimination statute  is  enforced.   While  some  gender-\r<br>\r<br>          conscious relief may adversely  impact one gender -- a  fact that\r<br>\r<br>          has not  been demonstrated in this  case -- that alone  would not\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          make the relief \"affirmative  action\" or the consequence  of that\r<br>\r<br>          relief  \"reverse discrimination.\"    To the  contrary, race-  and\r<br>\r<br>          gender-conscious    remedies    are    both    appropriate    and\r<br>\r<br>          constitutionally permissible under a  federal anti-discrimination\r<br>\r<br>          regime,  although such  remedial  measures are  still subject  to\r<br>\r<br>          equal protection review.

Section 1681(b) was patterned after   703(j) of\r<br>\r<br>          Title VII, 42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(j), and  was specifically designed\r<br>\r<br>          to  prohibit quotas  in university  admissions and  hiring, based\r<br>\r<br>          upon  the  percentage   of  individuals  of   one  gender  in   a\r<br>\r<br>          geographical  community.

Surely this is a far cry from a one-step imposition\r<br>\r<br>          of a gender-based quota.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Brown simply ignores the fact that it  is required to\r<br>\r<br>          accommodate  fully   the   interests   and   abilities   of   the\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresented gender, not because the three-part test mandates\r<br>\r<br>          preferential treatment for women ab initio, but because Brown has\r                                           __ ______\r<br>\r<br>          been  found (under  prong one)  to have  allocated its  athletics\r<br>\r<br>          participation opportunities so as to create a significant gender-\r<br>\r<br>          based  disparity with  respect  to these  opportunities, and  has\r<br>\r<br>          failed  (under  prong  two)  to  show  a  history and  continuing\r<br>\r<br>          practice of expansion  of opportunities for  the underrepresented\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -43-\r                                         -43-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          gender.   Brown's interpretation  conflates prongs one  and three\r<br>\r<br>          and distorts the three-part  test by reducing it to  an abstract,\r<br>\r<br>          mechanical determination of strict numerical proportionality.  In\r<br>\r<br>          short,  Brown treats the three-part test for compliance as a one-\r<br>\r<br>          part test for strict liability. \r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  also  fails  to   recognize  that  Title  IX's\r<br>\r<br>          remedial  focus is,  quite properly,  not on  the overrepresented\r<br>\r<br>          gender, but on the underrepresented gender; in  this case, women.\r<br>\r<br>          Title IX and its  implementing regulations protect the class  for\r<br>\r<br>          whose special benefit the  statute was enacted.

According    to   Brown's   relative    interests\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation of  the equal accommodation principle, the gender-\r<br>\r<br>          based disparity in athletics participation opportunities at Brown\r<br>\r<br>          is due to a lack  of interest on the part of its female students,\r<br>\r<br>          rather than  to  discrimination, and  any attempt  to remedy  the\r<br>\r<br>          disparity is, by definition, an unlawful quota.  This approach is\r<br>\r<br>          entirely contrary to \"Congress's unmistakably clear mandate  that\r<br>\r<br>          educational institutions  not use  federal  monies to  perpetuate\r<br>\r<br>          gender-based discrimination,\" id. at  907, and makes it virtually\r                                        ___\r<br>\r<br>          impossible  to  effectuate  Congress's intent  to  eliminate  sex\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in intercollegiate athletics.\r<br>\r<br>                                          E.\r                                          E.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  also  claims  error  in  the district  court's\r<br>\r<br>          failure to apply Title  VII standards to its analysis  of whether\r<br>\r<br>          Brown's intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.\r<br>\r<br>          The  district  court rejected  the analogy  to Title  VII, noting\r<br>\r<br>          that, while Title VII  \"seeks to determine whether gender-neutral\r<br>\r<br>          job openings have  been filled without regard  to gender[,] Title\r<br>\r<br>          IX  . . . was designed to  address the reality that sports teams,\r<br>\r<br>          unlike  the  vast  majority  of jobs,  do  have  official  gender\r                                                 __\r<br>\r<br>          requirements, and this statute accordingly approaches the concept\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          of discrimination differently from Title VII.\"  Cohen III, 879 F.\r                                                          _________\r<br>\r<br>          Supp. at 205.  \r<br>\r<br>                      It does not follow  from the fact that    1681(b) was\r<br>\r<br>          patterned after a  Title VII provision  that Title VII  standards\r<br>\r<br>          should   be  applied  to  a  Title  IX  analysis  of  whether  an\r<br>\r<br>          intercollegiate  athletics  program  equally   accommodates  both\r<br>\r<br>          genders,  as Brown contends.

Accordingly, and\r<br>\r<br>          notwithstanding Brown's protestations to the contrary, the  Title\r<br>\r<br>          VII concept  of the \"qualified pool\"  has no place in  a Title IX\r<br>\r<br>          analysis  of equal  opportunities  for male  and female  athletes\r<br>\r<br>          because women  are not \"qualified\"  to compete  for positions  on\r<br>\r<br>          men's  teams,  and vice-versa.    In  addition,  the  concept  of\r<br>\r<br>          \"preference\"  does not have the  same meaning, or  raise the same\r<br>\r<br>          equality concerns,  as it does  in the employment  and admissions\r<br>\r<br>          contexts.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown's approach  fails  to recognize  that,  because\r<br>\r<br>          gender-segregated teams are the norm in intercollegiate athletics\r<br>\r<br>          programs,  athletics differs  from admissions  and employment  in\r<br>\r<br>          analytically material  ways.  In providing  for gender-segregated\r<br>\r<br>          teams,  intercollegiate  athletics programs  necessarily allocate\r                                                       ___________\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities separately for male and female students, and, thus,\r<br>\r<br>          any  inquiry into a  claim of gender  discrimination must compare\r                                                               ____\r<br>\r<br>          the athletics participation  opportunities provided for  men with\r<br>\r<br>          those  provided  for  women.    For   this  reason,  and  because\r<br>\r<br>          recruitment  of interested athletes  is at the  discretion of the\r<br>\r<br>          institution, there  is a risk  that the institution  will recruit\r<br>\r<br>          only enough women  to fill  positions in a  program that  already\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresents women, and  that the smaller size  of the women's\r<br>\r<br>          program   will   have   the   effect   of   discouraging  women's\r<br>\r<br>          participation. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -49-\r                                         -49-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      In this  unique context, Title IX  operates to ensure\r<br>\r<br>          that the gender-segregated allocation of  athletics opportunities\r<br>\r<br>          does  not disadvantage either gender.  Rather than create a quota\r<br>\r<br>          or  preference,  this  unavoidably   gender-conscious  comparison\r<br>\r<br>          merely  provides for  the allocation  of athletics  resources and\r<br>\r<br>          participation  opportunities   between  the   sexes  in   a  non-\r<br>\r<br>          discriminatory  manner.

Thus,\r<br>\r<br>          at the heart  of this litigation is the question whether Title IX\r<br>\r<br>          permits  Brown to deny  its female students  equal opportunity to\r<br>\r<br>          participate in sports, based upon its unproven assertion that the\r<br>\r<br>          district court's finding of  a significant disparity in athletics\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities  for   male  and  female  students   reflects,  not\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in Brown's  intercollegiate athletics program, but\r<br>\r<br>          a lack of  interest on the  part of its  female students that  is\r<br>\r<br>          unrelated to a lack of opportunities.  \r<br>\r<br>                      We  view   Brown's  argument  that   women  are  less\r<br>\r<br>          interested   than   men  in   participating   in  intercollegiate\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -52-\r                                         -52-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          athletics, as well as its conclusion  that institutions should be\r<br>\r<br>          required to accommodate the interests and abilities of its female\r<br>\r<br>          students only  to the extent  that it accommodates  the interests\r<br>\r<br>          and abilities of  its male  students, with great  suspicion.   To\r<br>\r<br>          assert  that  Title  IX  permits institutions  to  provide  fewer\r<br>\r<br>          athletics  participation opportunities  for women  than for  men,\r<br>\r<br>          based upon the premise  that women are less interested  in sports\r<br>\r<br>          than are men,  is (among  other things) to  ignore the fact  that\r<br>\r<br>          Title  IX was  enacted  in order  to  remedy discrimination  that\r<br>\r<br>          results  from  stereotyped  notions  of  women's  interests   and\r<br>\r<br>          abilities.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Interest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum; they\r<br>\r<br>          evolve as a function  of opportunity and experience.   The Policy\r<br>\r<br>          Interpretation   recognizes   that   women's   lower    rate   of\r<br>\r<br>          participation in athletics  reflects women's  historical lack  of\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities  to participate  in sports.

Because  the  challenged\r<br>\r<br>          classification  is gender-based,  it must  be analyzed  under the\r<br>\r<br>          intermediate scrutiny  test.  Before proceeding  to the analysis,\r<br>\r<br>          however, we must  first address Brown's challenge to the standard\r<br>\r<br>          of review.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Brown concedes that  Adarand \"does not,  in partially\r                                           _______\r<br>\r<br>          overruling Metro  Broadcasting, set forth the  proper standard of\r                     ___________________\r<br>\r<br>          review for this  case.\"   Appellant's Br. at  29.

This case\r<br>\r<br>          presents  the issue of the legality of a federal district court's\r<br>\r<br>          determination, based  upon adjudicated  findings of fact,  that a\r<br>\r<br>          federal anti-discrimination statute has been violated, and of the\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            21.  In Frontiero,  a plurality  of the Court  concluded that\r                    _________\r<br>            gender-based  classifications,  \"like  classifications  based\r<br>            upon  race,  alienage,  or  national origin,  are  inherently\r<br>            suspect, and  must therefore be subjected  to strict judicial\r<br>            scrutiny.\"  411 U.S. at 688.  In the 23 years that have since\r<br>            elapsed, this  position has never commanded a majority of the\r<br>            Court,  and has never been  adopted by this  court.  Whatever\r<br>            may be the merits of adopting strict scrutiny as the standard\r<br>            to  be  applied   to  gender-based  classifications,   it  is\r<br>            inappropriate  to  suggest,  as  Brown does,  that  Frontiero\r                                                                _________\r<br>            compels its application here.  \r<br>                       Brown's  assertion  that  Adarand  obligates  this\r                                                 _______\r<br>            court to apply Croson  to its equal protection claim  is also\r                           ______\r<br>            incorrect.   As  noted previously,  Croson is  an affirmative\r                                                ______\r<br>            action  case and  does  not  control  review  of  a  judicial\r<br>            determination that a federal anti-discrimination  statute has\r<br>            been  violated.  To the extent that Brown assumes that Croson\r                                                                   ______\r<br>            governs the issue of the sufficiency of the factual predicate\r<br>            required  to uphold  a  federally mandated,  benign race-  or\r<br>            gender-based   classification,   that   assumption  is   also\r<br>            unfounded.   As we have explained,  Croson's factual concerns\r                                                ______\r<br>            are  not  raised  by  a  district  court's  determination  --\r<br>            predicated  upon  duly adjudicated  factual  findings bearing\r<br>            multiple indicia of reliability  and specificity -- of gender\r<br>            discrimination in  violation of a  federal statute.   We also\r<br>            point  out that  Adarand did  not reach  the question  of the\r                             _______\r<br>            sufficiency  of the  factual  predicate  required to  satisfy\r<br>            strict scrutiny  review of a  congressionally mandated  race-\r<br>            based classification.  \r<br>\r<br>                                         -64-\r                                         -64-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  and  constitutional propriety  of the  judicial remedy\r<br>\r<br>          ordered to provide  redress to plaintiffs with standing  who have\r<br>\r<br>          been injured by the violation. \r<br>\r<br>                      Second,   Adarand  does   not  even   discuss  gender\r                                _______\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination, and  its holding  is limited to  explicitly race-\r<br>\r<br>          based classifications.  --- U.S. at ---, 115  S.

First, despite the fact that 76 men and\r<br>\r<br>          30  women participated  on  donor-funded  varsity teams,  Brown's\r<br>\r<br>          proposed  plan disregarded  donor-funded varsity  teams.

In\r<br>                      order to bring Brown into compliance with\r<br>                      prong one under  defendants' Phase II,  I\r<br>                      would have  to order Brown  to cut enough\r<br>                      men's  teams  to eradicate  approximately\r<br>                      213  men's  varsity   positions.

Indeed, the plan\r<br>\r<br>          is replete with argumentative  statements more appropriate for an\r<br>\r<br>          appellate brief.  It  is obvious that Brown's plan  was addressed\r<br>\r<br>          to this court,  rather than to offering a  workable solution to a\r<br>\r<br>          difficult problem.\r<br>\r<br>                      It  is clear, nevertheless,  that Brown's proposal to\r<br>\r<br>          cut men's teams is a permissible means of effectuating compliance\r<br>\r<br>          with  the statute.   Thus,  although  we understand  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's reasons  for substituting  its own specific  relief under\r<br>\r<br>          the circumstances at the time, and although the district  court's\r<br>\r<br>          remedy  is within  the statutory  margins and  constitutional, we\r<br>\r<br>          think that  the district court  was wrong  to reject  out-of-hand\r<br>\r<br>          Brown's alternative plan  to reduce the  number of men's  varsity\r<br>\r<br>          teams.  After all,  the district court itself stated that  one of\r<br>\r<br>          the  compliance options available to  Brown under Title  IX is to\r<br>\r<br>          \"demote or  eliminate the  requisite number of  men's positions.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Cohen III, 879 F.

The context of\r<br>\r<br>          the  case has  changed in  two significant  respects since  Brown\r<br>\r<br>          presented its original plan.  First, the substantive issues  have\r<br>\r<br>          been decided adversely to Brown.  Brown is no longer an appellant\r<br>\r<br>          seeking a favorable result in the Court  of Appeals.  Second, the\r<br>\r<br>          district  court is not under  time constraints to  consider a new\r<br>\r<br>          plan and fashion a remedy so as to expedite appeal.  Accordingly,\r<br>\r<br>          we remand the case to the district court so that Brown can submit\r<br>\r<br>          a  further plan for its consideration.  In all other respects the\r<br>\r<br>          judgment  of the  district court  is  affirmed.   The preliminary\r<br>\r<br>          injunction issued by the district court in Cohen I,  809 F.

These Olympians represent the first full generation\r<br>\r<br>          of  women  to  grow  up  under  the  aegis  of  Title  IX.    The\r<br>\r<br>          unprecedented  success  of these  athletes  is due,  in  no small\r<br>\r<br>          measure, to Title IX's beneficent  effects on women's sports,  as\r<br>\r<br>          the athletes themselves have  acknowledged time and again.   What\r<br>\r<br>          stimulated  this  remarkable change  in  the  quality of  women's\r<br>\r<br>          athletic  competition  was not  a  sudden,  anomalous upsurge  in\r<br>\r<br>          women's interest  in sports,  but the  enforcement of  Title IX's\r<br>\r<br>          mandate of gender equity in sports.

Prong One\r<br>\r<br>                    A central issue  in this  case is the  manner in  which\r<br>\r<br>          athletic  \"participation opportunities\" are  counted.  During the\r<br>\r<br>          1990-91  academic year,  Brown fielded  16 men s  and  15 women s\r<br>\r<br>          varsity teams on  which 566 men and  328 women participated.   By\r<br>\r<br>          the 1993-94 year, there were 12 university-funded men s teams and\r<br>\r<br>          13 university funded women s teams.  These teams included 479 men\r<br>\r<br>          and 312 women.   Based  on an analysis  of membership in  varsity\r<br>\r<br>          teams,  the  district  court   concluded  that  there  existed  a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -90-\r                                         -90-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          disparity   between   female  participation   in  intercollegiate\r<br>\r<br>          athletics and female student enrollment.\r<br>\r<br>                    Even assuming that membership numbers in varsity sports\r<br>\r<br>          is a  reasonable proxy for participation opportunities  -- a view\r<br>\r<br>          with which I do not concur -- contact sports should be eliminated\r<br>\r<br>          from  the  calculus.   The regulation  at  34 C.F.R.    106.41(b)\r<br>\r<br>          (1995) provides that an academic institution may operate separate\r<br>\r<br>          teams  for members of each sex \"where  selection of such teams is\r<br>\r<br>          based  upon  competitive  skill or  the  activity  involved  is a\r<br>\r<br>          contact sport.\"  34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).  When a team is sponsored\r<br>\r<br>          only  for one sex, however, and where \"athletic opportunities for\r<br>\r<br>          members  of that sex have previously been limited, members of the\r<br>\r<br>          excluded  sex must  be allowed  to try-out  for the  team offered\r<br>\r<br>          unless  the sport  involved is  a contact  sport,\" id.  (emphasis\r          ________________________________________________   ___\r<br>\r<br>          added).   The  regulation, therefore,  allows schools  to operate\r<br>\r<br>          single-sex  teams  in contact  sports.  In counting participation\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities,  therefore, it does  not make sense  to include in\r<br>\r<br>          the  calculus  athletes  participating  in  contact  sports  that\r<br>\r<br>          include only men s teams.   For example, if a  university chooses\r<br>\r<br>          to  sponsor a football  team, it is  permitted to  sponsor only a\r<br>\r<br>          men s team.   Not  all sports  are  the same  and the  university\r<br>\r<br>          should be given the flexibility to determine which activities are\r<br>\r<br>          most  beneficial  to  its student  body.    By  including in  its\r<br>\r<br>          accounting a  contact sport that  requires very large  numbers of\r<br>\r<br>          participants, e.g., football, the district court skews the number\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -91-\r                                         -91-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          of  athletic  participants  --   making  it  impossible  for  the\r<br>\r<br>          university to  provide  both men's  and  women's teams  in  other\r<br>\r<br>          sports.\r<br>\r<br>                    If  the  athletes competing  in  sports  for which  the\r<br>\r<br>          university is  permitted to  field single-sex teams  are excluded\r<br>\r<br>          from the  calculation of  participation rates, the  proportion of\r<br>\r<br>          women  participants would  increase  dramatically  and prong  one\r<br>\r<br>          might be  satisfied.  If so, the inquiry ends and Brown should be\r<br>\r<br>          judged to be in compliance.\r<br>\r<br>                      2. Prong Two\r                      2. Prong Two\r<br>\r<br>                    The  district court concluded, and the majority appears\r<br>\r<br>          to  agree, that Brown failed to satisfy prong two because \"merely\r<br>\r<br>          reducing program offerings to the overrepresented gender does not\r<br>\r<br>          constitute  program expansion  for the  underrepresented gender.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Majority Opinion at  18.  This  is a curious  result because  the\r<br>\r<br>          entire three-prong test is based on relative participation rates.\r                                              ________\r<br>\r<br>          Prong one, for example, requires that participation opportunities\r<br>\r<br>          be provided  proportionately to enrollment, but  does not mandate\r<br>\r<br>          any absolute number of such opportunities.   The district court s\r<br>\r<br>          conclusion with  respect to  prong two, however,  implies that  a\r<br>\r<br>          school  must not only demonstrate that the proportion of women in\r<br>\r<br>          their program  is growing over time,  it must also show  that the\r<br>\r<br>          absolute number of women participating is increasing.26\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            26.  This  requirement presents  a  dilemma for  a school  in\r<br>            which  women  are  less  interested in  athletics,  as  Brown\r<br>            contends is the case.  Under such conditions, a school may be\r<br>\r<br>                                         -92-\r                                         -92-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Under  the  district court's  interpretation,  a school\r<br>\r<br>          facing  budgetary constraints must, in order to comply with prong\r<br>\r<br>          two, increase the opportunities available to the underrepresented\r               ________\r<br>\r<br>          gender,  even  if  it  cannot  afford  to  do  so.   Rather  than\r<br>\r<br>          respecting  the school s  right to  determine the  role athletics\r<br>\r<br>          will  play in the future --  including reducing the opportunities\r<br>\r<br>          available  to   the  formerly  overrepresented  gender to  ensure\r<br>\r<br>          proportionate  opportunities  --  the  district   court  and  the\r<br>\r<br>          majority  demand  that  the  absolute  number   of  opportunities\r                                       ________\r<br>\r<br>          provided to the underrepresented  gender be increased.  I  see no\r<br>\r<br>          possible  justification for this interpretation -- the regulation\r<br>\r<br>          is  intended to  protect against  discrimination, not  to promote\r<br>\r<br>          athletics  on  college campuses.   A  school  is not  required to\r<br>\r<br>          sponsor an  athletic program of any  particular size.  It  is not\r<br>\r<br>          for the courts, or  the legislature, for that matter,  to mandate\r<br>\r<br>          programs of a given  size.  The most that can be demanded is that\r<br>\r<br>          athletics be provided in a non-discriminatory manner.\r<br>\r<br>                    Furthermore,  the  claim   that  a  reduction   in  the\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities  given   to  the   overrepresented  gender  is   an\r<br>\r<br>          unacceptable  method of  coming  into compliance  with the  three\r<br>\r<br>          prong test  is contrary  to both  Cohen  II and  comments of  the\r                                            _________\r<br>\r<br>          majority opinion.

Prong Three\r                      3. Prong Three\r<br>\r<br>                    Prong three of the  three-prong test states that, where\r<br>\r<br>          an institution does not comply with prongs one or two, compliance\r<br>\r<br>          will be assessed on the basis of\r<br>\r<br>                      whether it  can be demonstrated  that the\r<br>                      interests and abilities of the members of\r<br>                      th[e]  [proportionately underrepresented]\r<br>                      sex  have  been  fully   and  effectively\r<br>                      accommodated by the present program.\r<br>\r<br>          44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,418 (December 11, 1979).\r<br>\r<br>                    According  to the  district  court,  Brown's  athletics\r<br>\r<br>          program   violates   prong   three   because   members   of   the\r<br>\r<br>          proportionately underrepresented sex  have demonstrated  interest\r<br>\r<br>          sufficient for a  university-funded varsity team  that is not  in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -94-\r                                         -94-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          fact being funded.  The district court asserts that this is not a\r<br>\r<br>          quota.   Brown, on  the other  hand, argues that  prong three  is\r<br>\r<br>          satisfied  when (1) the interests and abilities of members of the\r<br>\r<br>          proportionately underrepresented gender  (2) are accommodated  to\r<br>\r<br>          the same degree as the proportionately overrepresented gender.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  district  court's  narrow, literal  interpretation\r<br>\r<br>          should  be  rejected  because  prong  three  cannot  be  read  in\r<br>\r<br>          isolation.   First,  as Brown  points  out, the  Regulation  that\r<br>\r<br>          includes prong three provides that, in assessing compliance under\r<br>\r<br>          the regulation, \"the governing principle in this area is that the\r<br>\r<br>          athletic interests and  abilities of male and female  students be\r          _________________________________________________________________\r<br>\r<br>          equally  effectively accommodated.\"    Policy Interpretation,  44\r          _________________________________      _____________________\r<br>\r<br>          Fed.  Reg. 71,413, 71,414.  Thus, Brown contends, to meet \"fully\"\r<br>\r<br>          -- in  an absolute  sense --  the interests  and abilities  of an\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresented   gender,  while   unmet   interest  among   the\r<br>\r<br>          overrepresented  gender continues, would contravene the governing\r<br>\r<br>          principle of \"equally effective accommodat[ion]\" of the interests\r<br>\r<br>          and abilities of students of both genders.\r<br>\r<br>                    It  is   also  worthwhile  to  note   that  to  \"fully\"\r<br>\r<br>          accommodate the  interests and abilities of  the underrepresented\r<br>\r<br>          sex  is  an extraordinarily  high  --  perhaps impossibly  so  --\r<br>\r<br>          requirement.   How could an academic institution with a large and\r<br>\r<br>          diverse  student  body  ever  \"fully\"  accommodate  the  athletic\r<br>\r<br>          interests  of its  students?   Under  even  the largest  athletic\r<br>\r<br>          program,  it would  be surprising  to find  that there  is not  a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -95-\r                                         -95-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          single student who would  prefer to participate in  athletics but\r<br>\r<br>          does not do so because the school does not offer a program in the\r<br>\r<br>          particular sport that interests the student.  To read fully in an\r<br>\r<br>          absolute sense would make the third prong virtually impossible to\r<br>\r<br>          satisfy and, therefore, an irrelevant addition to the test.\r<br>\r<br>                    This  difficulty  was  recognized in  Cohen  II,  which\r                                                          _________\r<br>\r<br>          stated  that \"the mere fact  that there are  some female students\r<br>\r<br>          interested  in a sport does not ipso  facto require the school to\r                                          ___________\r<br>\r<br>          provide  a varsity  team  in  order  to  comply  with  the  third\r<br>\r<br>          benchmark.\"  Cohen II 991 F.2d at 898.

A \"viable\" tennis\r<br>\r<br>          team may require only a single player.  The same could be said of\r<br>\r<br>          any individual  sport, including golf, track  and field, cycling,\r<br>\r<br>          fencing,  archery, and  so  on.   Therefore,  we still  have  the\r<br>\r<br>          problem  that  to  \"fully   accommodate\"  the  interests  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresented sex may be impossible under the district court's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation.\r<br>\r<br>                    In light of the above, Brown argues that prong three is\r<br>\r<br>          in  fact ambiguous with respect  to whether \"fully\"  means (1) an\r<br>\r<br>          institution must meet 100% of the underrepresented gender's unmet\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -96-\r                                         -96-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          reasonable interest and ability, or (2)  an institution must meet\r<br>\r<br>          the  underrepresented  gender's  unmet  reasonable  interest  and\r<br>\r<br>          ability as fully as it meets those of the overrepresented gender.\r<br>\r<br>          I  agree  with  Brown  that,  in  the  context  of  OCR's  Policy\r<br>\r<br>          Interpretation, prong three is susceptible  to at least these two\r<br>\r<br>          plausible interpretations.    \r<br>\r<br>                    Additionally, section 1681(a),  a provision enacted  by\r<br>\r<br>          Congress as part of  Title IX itself, casts doubt on the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's reading of prong three.   20 U.S.C.   1681(a) (1988).  As\r<br>\r<br>          Brown points out, Title IX, of which the Policy Interpretation is\r<br>\r<br>          an   administrative   interpretation,   contains  language   that\r<br>\r<br>          prohibits the ordering of preferential  treatment on the basis of\r<br>\r<br>          gender due  to a failure of a program to substantially mirror the\r<br>\r<br>          gender ratio  of an institution.

First,  the  district court's  interpretation creates  a\r<br>\r<br>          quota  scheme.   Second,  even assuming  such  a quota  scheme is\r<br>\r<br>          otherwise  constitutional,  appellees  have  not  pointed  to  an\r<br>\r<br>          \"exceedingly  persuasive justification,\" see  Virginia, 116 S.Ct.\r                                                   ___  ________\r<br>\r<br>          at 2274, for this particular quota scheme.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -98-\r                                         -98-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      1. The Quota\r                      1. The Quota\r<br>\r<br>                    I  believe that the  three prong test,  as the district\r<br>\r<br>          court interprets  it, is a  quota.   I am in  square disagreement\r<br>\r<br>          with the majority, who believe that \"[n]o aspect of the  Title IX\r<br>\r<br>          regime  at issue  in  this  case  .  .  .  mandates  gender-based\r<br>\r<br>          preferences or quotas.\"   Majority  Opinion at 29.   Put  another\r<br>\r<br>          way,  I agree  that  \"Title  IX  is  not  an  affirmative  action\r<br>\r<br>          statute,\"  id., but I believe  that is exactly  what the district\r                     ___\r<br>\r<br>          court has made of it.   As interpreted by the district court, the\r<br>\r<br>          test constitutes an affirmative action, quota-based scheme.\r<br>\r<br>                    I  am less interested  in the actual  term \"quota\" than\r<br>\r<br>          the legally cognizable characteristics that render a quota scheme\r<br>\r<br>          impermissible.   And  those characteristics  are present  here in\r<br>\r<br>          spades.  I  am not persuaded by the majority's  argument that the\r<br>\r<br>          three-part test does not  constitute a quota because it  does not\r<br>\r<br>          permit an agency or court to find a violation solely on the basis\r<br>\r<br>          of prong one of the test; instead,  an institution must also fail\r<br>\r<br>          prongs  two and  three.   As Brown  rightly argues,  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's  application of  the three-prong  test requires  Brown to\r<br>\r<br>          allocate its athletic resources to meet the as-yet-unmet interest\r<br>\r<br>          of  a member  of the  underrepresented sex,  women in  this case,\r<br>\r<br>          while   simultaneously  neglecting   any  unmet   interest  among\r<br>\r<br>          individuals of the overrepresented  sex.  To the extent  that the\r<br>\r<br>          rate of interest in  athletics diverges between men and  women at\r<br>\r<br>          any   institution,  the  district  court's  interpretation  would\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -99-\r                                         -99-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          require  that  such  an  institution  treat  an  individual  male\r<br>\r<br>          student's  athletic interest and  an individual  female student's\r<br>\r<br>          athletic   interest   completely   differently:   one   student's\r<br>\r<br>          reasonable interest would have  to be met, by law,  while meeting\r                                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>          the other  student's interest  would only  aggravate the  lack of\r<br>\r<br>          proportionality  giving rise to the  legal duty.   \"The injury in\r<br>\r<br>          cases  of  this kind  is  that  a 'discriminatory  classification\r<br>\r<br>          prevent[s] . . . competition on an equal footing.'\"  Adarand, 115\r                                                               _______\r<br>\r<br>          S.

The\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>          logic of this position escapes me.  A school can satisfy the test\r<br>\r<br>          in  three ways.   The first prong  is met if  the school provides\r<br>\r<br>          participation  opportunities  for  male and  female  students  in\r<br>\r<br>          numbers substantially  proportionate to their enrollments.   This\r<br>\r<br>          prong surely requires statistical balancing.  The second prong is\r<br>\r<br>          satisfied if an institution that cannot meet prong one can show a\r<br>\r<br>          \"continuing practice  of program expansion  which is demonstrably\r<br>\r<br>          responsive  to  the  developing  interest and  abilities  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          members  of the underrepresented sex.\"   44 Fed.  Reg. at 71,418.\r<br>\r<br>          It can  hardly be  denied  that this  prong requires  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          balancing as it is essentially a test that requires the school to\r<br>\r<br>          show that  it is moving in the  direction of satisfying the first\r<br>\r<br>          prong.  Establishing that a school is moving inexorably closer to\r<br>\r<br>          satisfying a  requirement that demands  statistical balancing can\r<br>\r<br>          only be done by  demonstrating an improvement in the  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          balance.    In  other  words,  the  second  prong  also  requires\r<br>\r<br>          balancing.  Finally, the third prong, interpreted as the majority\r<br>\r<br>          advocates, dispenses  with statistical balancing only  because it\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            University  of  Illinois  not  been in  compliance,  lack  of\r                                      ___\r<br>            compliance  with  the three-prong  test  alone  would trigger\r                                                     _____\r<br>            automatic liability,  nor did  the Seventh Circuit  spell out\r<br>            what steps would  have been  required of defendant.   At  any\r<br>            rate,  Kelley  pre-dates  the  Supreme  Court's  opinions  in\r                   ______\r<br>            Adarand and Virginia,  meaning that it suffers from  the same\r            _______     ________\r<br>            defects as Cohen II.\r                       ________\r<br>\r<br>                                        -101-\r                                        -101-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          choose to accord zero weight to one side of the  balance.  Even a\r<br>\r<br>          single  person   with   a  reasonable   unmet  interest   defeats\r<br>\r<br>          compliance.    This standard,  in  fact,  goes farther  than  the\r<br>\r<br>          straightforward  quota test  of  prong  one.   According  to  the\r<br>\r<br>          district court,  the unmet interests of  the underrepresented sex\r<br>\r<br>          must be completely accommodated before any of the interest of the\r                  __________                     ___\r<br>\r<br>          overrepresented gender can be accommodated.28\r<br>\r<br>                    A pragmatic  overview of the effect  of the three-prong\r<br>\r<br>          test leads me to reject the majority's claim that the three-prong\r<br>\r<br>          test  does not  amount to  a quota  because it  involves multiple\r<br>\r<br>          prongs.  In  my view it  is the result of  the test, and  not the\r<br>\r<br>          number of steps involved, that should determine if a quota system\r<br>\r<br>          exists.   Regardless  of how  many steps  are involved,  the fact\r<br>\r<br>          remains  that  the  test  requires   proportionate  participation\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities for both sexes (prong one) unless one sex is simply\r<br>\r<br>          not  interested in participating (prong  three).  It  seems to me\r<br>\r<br>          that a quota with an exception for  situations in which there are\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            28.  The  problem  with   the  majority s  argument   can  be\r<br>            illustrated  with  a hypothetical  college  admissions policy\r<br>            that would require proportionality  between the gender  ratio\r<br>            of the  local student  aged population and  that of  admitted\r<br>            students.   This  policy is  comparable to  prong one  of the\r<br>            three prong test and is, without a doubt, a quota.   It is no\r<br>            less  a quota if an exception exists for schools whose gender\r<br>            ratio  differs from  that of the  local population  but which\r<br>            admit  every applicant  of the  underrepresented gender.   It\r<br>            remains a quota because  the school is forced to  admit every\r<br>            female  applicant until it  reaches the requisite proportion.\r<br>            Similarly, the  district court's interpretation  requires the\r<br>            school to  accommodate the interests of  every female student\r<br>            until proportionality is reached.\r<br>\r<br>                                        -102-\r                                        -102-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          insufficient interested students to  allow the school to  meet it\r<br>\r<br>          remains  a  quota.    All of  the  negative  effects  of a  quota\r<br>\r<br>          remain,29 and the school  can escape the quota under  prong three\r<br>\r<br>          only  by offering  preferential treatment to  the group  that has\r<br>\r<br>          demonstrated less interest in athletics.\r<br>\r<br>                      2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r                      2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r<br>\r<br>                    In view  of the  quota scheme  adopted by the  district\r<br>\r<br>          court, and Congress' specific disavowal of any  intent to require\r<br>\r<br>          quotas as part of Title  IX, appellees have not met their  burden\r<br>\r<br>          of  showing an  \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for this\r<br>\r<br>          gender-conscious exercise of  government authority.

As a result,\r<br>\r<br>          I opt for Brown's construction of prong three, which, as  we have\r<br>\r<br>          discussed, infra, is also a reasonable reading.\r                     _____\r<br>\r<br>                    Accordingly,  I would  reverse and  remand for  further\r<br>\r<br>          proceedings.\r<br>\r<br>                               III.

Evidentiary Issues\r<br>\r<br>                    In  disputes  over  the  representation  of   women  in\r<br>\r<br>          athletic  programs, it  is  inevitable that  statistical evidence\r<br>\r<br>          will  be relevant.    There  is simply  no  other  way to  assess\r<br>\r<br>          participation  rates,   interest  levels,  and  abilities.    The\r<br>\r<br>          majority  opinion, however,  offers  inconsistent  guidance  with\r<br>\r<br>          respect to the role of  statistics in Title IX claims.   Early in\r<br>\r<br>          the opinion,  the majority  approvingly cites to  the statistical\r<br>\r<br>          evaluations conducted  in  Cohen  I, Cohen  II,  and  Cohen  III.\r                                     ________  _________        __________\r<br>\r<br>          Majority  Opinion at 8-10.   The figures  in question demonstrate\r<br>\r<br>          that women s participation in athletics is less than proportional\r<br>\r<br>          to their enrollment.   Later  in the opinion,  however, when  the\r<br>\r<br>          level  of interest among  women at Brown  is at  issue, the court\r<br>\r<br>          adopts  a   much  more  critical  attitude   towards  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          evidence: \"[T]here exists the  danger that, rather than providing\r<br>\r<br>          a  true  measure  of  women s  interest  in  sports,  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          evidence purporting to reflect women s interest instead  provides\r<br>\r<br>          only a  measure of the very  discrimination that is and  has been\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                        -105-\r                                        -105-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          the  basis for women s lack of opportunity.\"  Majority Opinion at\r<br>\r<br>          53.   In other words, evidence of differential levels of interest\r<br>\r<br>          is not to be credited because it may simply reflect the result of\r<br>\r<br>          past discrimination.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  refusal to  accept surveys  of interest  levels as\r<br>\r<br>          evidence of interest raises the question of what indicators might\r<br>\r<br>          be used.  The majority offers no guidance to a  school seeking to\r<br>\r<br>          assess  the levels  of interest  of its  students.   Although the\r<br>\r<br>          three-prong  test, even  as  interpreted by  the district  court,\r<br>\r<br>          appears to  allow the school  the opportunity to  show a lack  of\r<br>\r<br>          interest, the majority rejects the best -- and perhaps the only -\r<br>\r<br>          - mechanism for making such a showing.\r<br>\r<br>                    Brown claims that the district court erred in excluding\r<br>\r<br>          evidence pertaining to the relative athletic interests of men and\r<br>\r<br>          women  at the  university.   Brown sought  to introduce  the NCAA\r<br>\r<br>          Gender Equity Study and  the results of an undergraduate  poll on\r<br>\r<br>          student  interest in athletics, but  was not permitted  to do so.\r<br>\r<br>          The majority is unsympathetic to Brown's claim that the disparity\r<br>\r<br>          between  athletic  opportunities  for  men and  women  reflect  a\r<br>\r<br>          gender-based  difference in  interest  levels.   Indeed,  despite\r<br>\r<br>          Brown's  attempt to present evidence in support of its claim, the\r<br>\r<br>          majority   characterizes   Brown's  argument   as   an  \"unproven\r<br>\r<br>          assertion.\"  Majority Opinion at 51.30\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            30.  Among  the   evidence  submitted   by  Brown   are:  (i)\r<br>            admissions data showing greater athletic interest among  male\r<br>            applicants than  female applicants;  (ii) college  board data\r<br>\r<br>                                        -106-\r                                        -106-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Furthermore, the majority recognizes  that institutions\r<br>\r<br>          are  entitled  to  use  any  nondiscriminatory  method  of  their\r<br>\r<br>          choosing to determine athletic interests.  Majority Opinion at 53\r<br>\r<br>          n.15.  If  statistical evidence of  interest levels is not  to be\r<br>\r<br>          considered by courts,  however, there  is no way  for schools  to\r<br>\r<br>          determine whether they are in compliance.  Any studies or surveys\r<br>\r<br>          they might conduct in order to assess their own compliance would,\r<br>\r<br>          in  the event of litigation, be deemed irrelevant.  Regardless of\r<br>\r<br>          the  efforts made by the  academic institution, the  specter of a\r<br>\r<br>          lawsuit would be ever-present.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  addition, the majority has put the power to control\r<br>\r<br>          athletics and the provision of athletic resources in the hands of\r<br>\r<br>          the  underrepresented gender.   Virtually  every other  aspect of\r<br>\r<br>          college life is  entrusted to the institution,  but athletics has\r<br>\r<br>          now  been carved  out as an  exception and  the university  is no\r<br>\r<br>          longer in full  control of its program.

Apparently no weight\r<br>\r<br>          is given  to the sustainability of the  interest, the cost of the\r<br>\r<br>          sport, the  university s view on  the desirability of  the sport,\r<br>\r<br>          and so on.\r<br>\r<br>                              IV.

FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r<br>\r<br>                    Finally,  it  is  important  to   remember  that  Brown\r<br>\r<br>          University  is  a  private  institution  with a  constitutionally\r<br>\r<br>          protected  First  Amendment  right  to  choose  its   curriculum.\r<br>\r<br>          Athletics  are part of that curriculum.  Although the protections\r<br>\r<br>          of the First Amendment cannot  be used to justify discrimination,\r<br>\r<br>          this  court should  not forget that  it has  a duty  to protect a\r<br>\r<br>          private  institution s   right  to  mould  its   own  educational\r<br>\r<br>          environment.\r<br>\r<br>                    The majority pays  lip service to these concerns in the\r<br>\r<br>          final pages of its long opinion, stating  that \" we are a society\r<br>\r<br>          that  cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that universities\r<br>\r<br>          deserve great leeway in their operations. \"   Majority Opinion at\r<br>\r<br>          69  (quoting Cohen II,  991 F.2d at 906),  and \"[o]ur respect for\r                       ________\r<br>\r<br>          academic freedom  and reluctance to interject  ourselves into the\r<br>\r<br>          conduct of university affairs  counsels that we give universities\r<br>\r<br>          as  much freedom as possible.\"   Majority Opinion at 75.

In\r<br>\r<br>            the  first  appeal, a  panel  of  this  court elucidated  the\r<br>\r<br>            applicable legal  framework, upholding the  substance of  the\r<br>\r<br>            district court's interpretation and application of the law in\r<br>\r<br>            granting  plaintiffs' motion  for a  preliminary injunction,1\r<br>\r<br>            and  rejecting essentially  the  same  legal arguments  Brown\r<br>\r<br>            makes here.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown contends  that we  are free to  disregard the\r<br>\r<br>            prior  panel's explication of the  law in Cohen  II.

While\r<br>\r<br>            we acknowledge that the  law of the case doctrine  is subject\r<br>\r<br>            to  exceptions, we conclude that none  applies here, and that\r<br>\r<br>            the  decision rendered by the prior panel in the first appeal\r<br>\r<br>            is not,  as Brown claims, \"legally  defective.\"  Accordingly,\r<br>\r<br>            we decline Brown's invitation  to undertake plenary review of\r<br>\r<br>            issues decided in the  previous appeal and treat Cohen  II as\r                                                             _________\r<br>\r<br>            controlling authority, dispositive of  the core issues raised\r<br>\r<br>            here.  \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            1.

As  applied  in the  federal\r<br>            courts today,  the  law of  the  case doctrine  more  closely\r<br>            resembles  the  doctrine of  stare decisis.    1B Moore  at  \r                                         _____ _______\r<br>            0.404[1].   Both  doctrines reflect  concerns that  have long\r<br>            been recognized as fundamentally important to the rule of law\r<br>            -- e.g., stability, predictability, and respect  for judicial\r<br>            authority --  and both doctrines  are applied  \"with more  or\r<br>            less rigidity depending on which interest is served.\"  Id. at\r                                                                   ___\r<br>            II-2.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          developed record.  In  this case, however, the record  before the\r<br>\r<br>          prior panel  was \"sufficiently developed and  the facts necessary\r<br>\r<br>          to  shape the  proper  legal matrix  [we]re sufficiently  clear,\"\r<br>\r<br>          Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 904, and nothing in the record subsequently\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>          developed  at trial constitutes  substantially different evidence\r<br>\r<br>          that might undermine the validity of the prior panel's rulings of\r<br>\r<br>          law.

Indeed, Brown\r                     ________\r<br>\r<br>          argues  as if  the  prior  panel  had  not  decided  the  precise\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  interpretation questions  presented (which  it clearly\r<br>\r<br>          did)  and  as if  the  district court's  liability  analysis were\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          contrary  to the law enunciated in  Cohen II (which it clearly is\r                                              ________\r<br>\r<br>          not).   Finding Brown's  bare assertions to  be unpersuasive,  we\r<br>\r<br>          decline the invitation  to this court to \"change its  mind.\"  The\r<br>\r<br>          precedent  established   by  the  prior  panel   is  not  clearly\r<br>\r<br>          erroneous; it  is  the law  of  this case  and  the law  of  this\r<br>\r<br>          circuit. \r<br>\r<br>                                         IV.\r                                         IV.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  contends that the  district court misconstrued\r<br>\r<br>          and misapplied  the three-part test.   Specifically, Brown argues\r<br>\r<br>          that the  district court's interpretation and  application of the\r<br>\r<br>          test  is irreconcilable with the statute, the regulation, and the\r<br>\r<br>          agency's interpretation of the law, and effectively renders Title\r<br>\r<br>          IX  an \"affirmative  action statute\"  that mandates  preferential\r<br>\r<br>          treatment  for women  by  imposing quotas  in  excess of  women's\r<br>\r<br>          relative interests and abilities in athletics.  Brown asserts, in\r<br>\r<br>          the alternative,  that if  the district court  properly construed\r<br>\r<br>          the test, then the  test itself violates Title IX and  the United\r<br>\r<br>          States Constitution.\r<br>\r<br>                      We  emphasize  two  points  at the  outset.    First,\r<br>\r<br>          notwithstanding Brown's persistent invocation of the inflammatory\r<br>\r<br>          terms \"affirmative  action,\" \"preference,\"  and \"quota,\"  this is\r<br>\r<br>          not an affirmative action case.  Second, Brown's efforts to evade\r<br>\r<br>          the controlling authority of Cohen II by recasting its core legal\r                                       ________\r<br>\r<br>          arguments as challenges to the \"district court's  interpretation\"\r<br>\r<br>          of the law are unavailing; the primary arguments raised here have\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -27-\r                                         -27-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          already  been  litigated and  decided adversely  to Brown  in the\r<br>\r<br>          prior appeal.  \r<br>\r<br>                                          A.\r                                          A.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown's   talismanic   incantation  of   \"affirmative\r<br>\r<br>          action\" has no  legal application to this case and is not helpful\r<br>\r<br>          to Brown's cause.  While \"affirmative action\" may  have different\r<br>\r<br>          connotations  as a matter  of politics, as  a matter of  law, its\r<br>\r<br>          meaning  is more  circumscribed.   True affirmative  action cases\r<br>\r<br>          have  historically involved a  voluntary10 undertaking  to remedy\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination  (as in  a program  implemented by  a governmental\r<br>\r<br>          body,  or  by a  private employer  or  institution), by  means of\r<br>\r<br>          specific  group-based  preferences  or  numerical  goals,  and  a\r<br>\r<br>          specific timetable  for achieving those goals.

Here,  gender-conscious  relief  was\r<br>\r<br>          ordered by  an Article  III court, constitutionally  compelled to\r<br>\r<br>          have  before it  litigants with  standing to  raise the  cause of\r<br>\r<br>          action alleged; for the  purpose of providing relief upon  a duly\r<br>\r<br>          adjudicated   determination   that   specific    defendants   had\r<br>\r<br>          discriminated  against a certified class of women in violation of\r<br>\r<br>          a  federal anti-discrimination  statute; based  upon  findings of\r<br>\r<br>          fact  that were  subject to the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.  The\r<br>\r<br>          factual problem  presented in affirmative action  cases is, \"Does\r<br>\r<br>          the evidence support a finding of discrimination such  that race-\r<br>\r<br>          or gender-conscious remedial measures  are appropriate?\"  We find\r<br>\r<br>          these  multiple  indicia of  reliability  and  specificity to  be\r<br>\r<br>          sufficient to answer that question in the affirmative.\r<br>\r<br>                      From  the  mere fact  that  a remedy  flowing  from a\r<br>\r<br>          judicial determination of discrimination is  gender-conscious, it\r<br>\r<br>          does not follow that the remedy constitutes \"affirmative action.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Nor  does a  \"reverse discrimination\" claim  arise every  time an\r<br>\r<br>          anti-discrimination statute  is  enforced.   While  some  gender-\r<br>\r<br>          conscious relief may adversely  impact one gender -- a  fact that\r<br>\r<br>          has not  been demonstrated in this  case -- that alone  would not\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          make the relief \"affirmative  action\" or the consequence  of that\r<br>\r<br>          relief  \"reverse discrimination.\"    To the  contrary, race-  and\r<br>\r<br>          gender-conscious    remedies    are    both    appropriate    and\r<br>\r<br>          constitutionally permissible under a  federal anti-discrimination\r<br>\r<br>          regime,  although such  remedial  measures are  still subject  to\r<br>\r<br>          equal protection review.

Surely this is a far cry from a one-step imposition\r<br>\r<br>          of a gender-based quota.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Brown simply ignores the fact that it  is required to\r<br>\r<br>          accommodate  fully   the   interests   and   abilities   of   the\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresented gender, not because the three-part test mandates\r<br>\r<br>          preferential treatment for women ab initio, but because Brown has\r                                           __ ______\r<br>\r<br>          been  found (under  prong one)  to have  allocated its  athletics\r<br>\r<br>          participation opportunities so as to create a significant gender-\r<br>\r<br>          based  disparity with  respect  to these  opportunities, and  has\r<br>\r<br>          failed  (under  prong  two)  to  show  a  history and  continuing\r<br>\r<br>          practice of expansion  of opportunities for  the underrepresented\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -43-\r                                         -43-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          gender.

In\r<br>\r<br>          short,  Brown treats the three-part test for compliance as a one-\r<br>\r<br>          part test for strict liability. \r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  also  fails  to   recognize  that  Title  IX's\r<br>\r<br>          remedial  focus is,  quite properly,  not on  the overrepresented\r<br>\r<br>          gender, but on the underrepresented gender; in  this case, women.\r<br>\r<br>          Title IX and its  implementing regulations protect the class  for\r<br>\r<br>          whose special benefit the  statute was enacted.

To adopt the\r<br>\r<br>          relative interests  approach would be, not only to overrule Cohen\r                                                                      _____\r<br>\r<br>          II, but to rewrite  the enforcing agency's interpretation  of its\r          __\r<br>\r<br>          own  regulation  so  as  to  incorporate  an  entirely  different\r<br>\r<br>          standard  for  Title  IX  compliance.

According    to   Brown's   relative    interests\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation of  the equal accommodation principle, the gender-\r<br>\r<br>          based disparity in athletics participation opportunities at Brown\r<br>\r<br>          is due to a lack  of interest on the part of its female students,\r<br>\r<br>          rather than  to  discrimination, and  any attempt  to remedy  the\r<br>\r<br>          disparity is, by definition, an unlawful quota.  This approach is\r<br>\r<br>          entirely contrary to \"Congress's unmistakably clear mandate  that\r<br>\r<br>          educational institutions  not use  federal  monies to  perpetuate\r<br>\r<br>          gender-based discrimination,\" id. at  907, and makes it virtually\r                                        ___\r<br>\r<br>          impossible  to  effectuate  Congress's intent  to  eliminate  sex\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in intercollegiate athletics.\r<br>\r<br>                                          E.\r                                          E.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown  also  claims  error  in  the district  court's\r<br>\r<br>          failure to apply Title  VII standards to its analysis  of whether\r<br>\r<br>          Brown's intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.\r<br>\r<br>          The  district  court rejected  the analogy  to Title  VII, noting\r<br>\r<br>          that, while Title VII  \"seeks to determine whether gender-neutral\r<br>\r<br>          job openings have  been filled without regard  to gender[,] Title\r<br>\r<br>          IX  . . . was designed to  address the reality that sports teams,\r<br>\r<br>          unlike  the  vast  majority  of jobs,  do  have  official  gender\r                                                 __\r<br>\r<br>          requirements, and this statute accordingly approaches the concept\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          of discrimination differently from Title VII.\"  Cohen III, 879 F.\r                                                          _________\r<br>\r<br>          Supp. at 205.  \r<br>\r<br>                      It does not follow  from the fact that    1681(b) was\r<br>\r<br>          patterned after a  Title VII provision  that Title VII  standards\r<br>\r<br>          should   be  applied  to  a  Title  IX  analysis  of  whether  an\r<br>\r<br>          intercollegiate  athletics  program  equally   accommodates  both\r<br>\r<br>          genders,  as Brown contends.

Accordingly, and\r<br>\r<br>          notwithstanding Brown's protestations to the contrary, the  Title\r<br>\r<br>          VII concept  of the \"qualified pool\"  has no place in  a Title IX\r<br>\r<br>          analysis  of equal  opportunities  for male  and female  athletes\r<br>\r<br>          because women  are not \"qualified\"  to compete  for positions  on\r<br>\r<br>          men's  teams,  and vice-versa.    In  addition,  the  concept  of\r<br>\r<br>          \"preference\"  does not have the  same meaning, or  raise the same\r<br>\r<br>          equality concerns,  as it does  in the employment  and admissions\r<br>\r<br>          contexts.\r<br>\r<br>                      Brown's approach  fails  to recognize  that,  because\r<br>\r<br>          gender-segregated teams are the norm in intercollegiate athletics\r<br>\r<br>          programs,  athletics differs  from admissions  and employment  in\r<br>\r<br>          analytically material  ways.  In providing  for gender-segregated\r<br>\r<br>          teams,  intercollegiate  athletics programs  necessarily allocate\r                                                       ___________\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities separately for male and female students, and, thus,\r<br>\r<br>          any  inquiry into a  claim of gender  discrimination must compare\r                                                               ____\r<br>\r<br>          the athletics participation  opportunities provided for  men with\r<br>\r<br>          those  provided  for  women.    For   this  reason,  and  because\r<br>\r<br>          recruitment  of interested athletes  is at the  discretion of the\r<br>\r<br>          institution, there  is a risk  that the institution  will recruit\r<br>\r<br>          only enough women  to fill  positions in a  program that  already\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresents women, and  that the smaller size  of the women's\r<br>\r<br>          program   will   have   the   effect   of   discouraging  women's\r<br>\r<br>          participation. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -49-\r                                         -49-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      In this  unique context, Title IX  operates to ensure\r<br>\r<br>          that the gender-segregated allocation of  athletics opportunities\r<br>\r<br>          does  not disadvantage either gender.  Rather than create a quota\r<br>\r<br>          or  preference,  this  unavoidably   gender-conscious  comparison\r<br>\r<br>          merely  provides for  the allocation  of athletics  resources and\r<br>\r<br>          participation  opportunities   between  the   sexes  in   a  non-\r<br>\r<br>          discriminatory  manner.     As  the  Seventh   Circuit  observed,\r<br>\r<br>          \"Congress itself  recognized  that addressing  discrimination  in\r<br>\r<br>          athletics  presented a unique set of problems not raised in areas\r<br>\r<br>          such  as employment  and  academics.\"   Kelley,  35 F.3d  at  270\r                                                  ______\r<br>\r<br>          (citing  Sex  Discrimination  Regulations,  Hearings  Before  the\r                   ________________________________________________________\r<br>\r<br>          Subcommittee  on Post  Secondary  Education of  the Committee  on\r          _________________________________________________________________\r<br>\r<br>          Education and Labor, 94th Cong.,  1st Sess. at 46, 54,  125, 129,\r          ___________________\r<br>\r<br>          152, 177, 299-300  (1975); 118 Cong.

Courts and institutions  must have some  way of\r<br>\r<br>          determining whether  an institution complies with  the mandate of\r<br>\r<br>          Title  IX  and  its   supporting  regulations  to  provide  equal\r<br>\r<br>          athletics opportunities  for both genders, despite  the fact that\r<br>\r<br>          the  institution  maintains single-sex  teams,  and  some way  of\r<br>\r<br>          fashioning  a remedy  upon a  determination that  the institution\r<br>\r<br>          does not  equally and  effectively accommodate the  interests and\r<br>\r<br>          abilities of both  genders.

Thus,\r<br>\r<br>          at the heart  of this litigation is the question whether Title IX\r<br>\r<br>          permits  Brown to deny  its female students  equal opportunity to\r<br>\r<br>          participate in sports, based upon its unproven assertion that the\r<br>\r<br>          district court's finding of  a significant disparity in athletics\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities  for   male  and  female  students   reflects,  not\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in Brown's  intercollegiate athletics program, but\r<br>\r<br>          a lack of  interest on the  part of its  female students that  is\r<br>\r<br>          unrelated to a lack of opportunities.  \r<br>\r<br>                      We  view   Brown's  argument  that   women  are  less\r<br>\r<br>          interested   than   men  in   participating   in  intercollegiate\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -52-\r                                         -52-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          athletics, as well as its conclusion  that institutions should be\r<br>\r<br>          required to accommodate the interests and abilities of its female\r<br>\r<br>          students only  to the extent  that it accommodates  the interests\r<br>\r<br>          and abilities of  its male  students, with great  suspicion.   To\r<br>\r<br>          assert  that  Title  IX  permits institutions  to  provide  fewer\r<br>\r<br>          athletics  participation opportunities  for women  than for  men,\r<br>\r<br>          based upon the premise  that women are less interested  in sports\r<br>\r<br>          than are men,  is (among  other things) to  ignore the fact  that\r<br>\r<br>          Title  IX was  enacted  in order  to  remedy discrimination  that\r<br>\r<br>          results  from  stereotyped  notions  of  women's  interests   and\r<br>\r<br>          abilities.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Interest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum; they\r<br>\r<br>          evolve as a function  of opportunity and experience.   The Policy\r<br>\r<br>          Interpretation   recognizes   that   women's   lower    rate   of\r<br>\r<br>          participation in athletics  reflects women's  historical lack  of\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities  to participate  in sports.

Moreover, Webster, which Cohen II  cited along with\r            _______             _______        ________\r<br>            Metro Broadcasting, was not overruled or in any way  rendered\r            __________________\r<br>            suspect by Adarand.     \r                       _______\r<br>\r<br>            20.  It  is  well  settled  that  the   reach  of  the  equal\r<br>            protection  guarantee  of  the Fifth  Amendment  Due  Process\r<br>            Clause  -- the basis for Brown's equal protection claim -- is\r<br>            coextensive  with  that  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Equal\r<br>\r<br>                                         -62-\r                                         -62-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  scheme.   Cohen  II,  991  F.2d  at  901  (finding  no\r                               _________\r<br>\r<br>          constitutional infirmity, assuming arguendo, that  the regulation\r                                             ________\r<br>\r<br>          creates a classification somewhat  in favor of women).   Thus, to\r<br>\r<br>          the  extent that  Brown challenges  the statutory  scheme itself,\r<br>\r<br>          that  challenge is foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine.\r<br>\r<br>          Nevertheless, the  remedy ordered for  a violation  of a  federal\r<br>\r<br>          anti-discrimination statute is still  subject to equal protection\r<br>\r<br>          review, assuming that it constitutes  gender-conscious government\r<br>\r<br>          action.   See  Miller,  --- U.S.  at  ---, 115  S.  Ct. at  2491.\r                    ___  ______\r<br>\r<br>          Therefore,  we  review  the  constitutionality  of  the  district\r<br>\r<br>          court's  order  requiring  Brown  to  comply  with  Title  IX  by\r<br>\r<br>          accommodating fully and effectively  the athletics interests  and\r<br>\r<br>          abilities  of  its  women   students.    Because  the  challenged\r<br>\r<br>          classification  is gender-based,  it must  be analyzed  under the\r<br>\r<br>          intermediate scrutiny  test.  Before proceeding  to the analysis,\r<br>\r<br>          however, we must  first address Brown's challenge to the standard\r<br>\r<br>          of review.  \r<br>\r<br>                      Brown concedes that  Adarand \"does not,  in partially\r                                           _______\r<br>\r<br>          overruling Metro  Broadcasting, set forth the  proper standard of\r                     ___________________\r<br>\r<br>          review for this  case.\"   Appellant's Br. at  29.   Nevertheless,\r<br>\r<br>          Brown asserts  that \"[w]hile Adarand  is a case  involving racial\r                                       _______\r<br>\r<br>          classification,   its  analysis   clearly   applies   to   gender\r<br>\r<br>          classification as  well.\"  Id.  at 27.

This case\r<br>\r<br>          presents  the issue of the legality of a federal district court's\r<br>\r<br>          determination, based  upon adjudicated  findings of fact,  that a\r<br>\r<br>          federal anti-discrimination statute has been violated, and of the\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            21.  In Frontiero,  a plurality  of the Court  concluded that\r                    _________\r<br>            gender-based  classifications,  \"like  classifications  based\r<br>            upon  race,  alienage,  or  national origin,  are  inherently\r<br>            suspect, and  must therefore be subjected  to strict judicial\r<br>            scrutiny.\"  411 U.S. at 688.  In the 23 years that have since\r<br>            elapsed, this  position has never commanded a majority of the\r<br>            Court,  and has never been  adopted by this  court.  Whatever\r<br>            may be the merits of adopting strict scrutiny as the standard\r<br>            to  be  applied   to  gender-based  classifications,   it  is\r<br>            inappropriate  to  suggest,  as  Brown does,  that  Frontiero\r                                                                _________\r<br>            compels its application here.  \r<br>                       Brown's  assertion  that  Adarand  obligates  this\r                                                 _______\r<br>            court to apply Croson  to its equal protection claim  is also\r                           ______\r<br>            incorrect.   As  noted previously,  Croson is  an affirmative\r                                                ______\r<br>            action  case and  does  not  control  review  of  a  judicial\r<br>            determination that a federal anti-discrimination  statute has\r<br>            been  violated.  To the extent that Brown assumes that Croson\r                                                                   ______\r<br>            governs the issue of the sufficiency of the factual predicate\r<br>            required  to uphold  a  federally mandated,  benign race-  or\r<br>            gender-based   classification,   that   assumption  is   also\r<br>            unfounded.   As we have explained,  Croson's factual concerns\r                                                ______\r<br>            are  not  raised  by  a  district  court's  determination  --\r<br>            predicated  upon  duly adjudicated  factual  findings bearing\r<br>            multiple indicia of reliability  and specificity -- of gender\r<br>            discrimination in  violation of a  federal statute.   We also\r<br>            point  out that  Adarand did  not reach  the question  of the\r                             _______\r<br>            sufficiency  of the  factual  predicate  required to  satisfy\r<br>            strict scrutiny  review of a  congressionally mandated  race-\r<br>            based classification.  \r<br>\r<br>                                         -64-\r                                         -64-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          statutory  and  constitutional propriety  of the  judicial remedy\r<br>\r<br>          ordered to provide  redress to plaintiffs with standing  who have\r<br>\r<br>          been injured by the violation. \r<br>\r<br>                      Second,   Adarand  does   not  even   discuss  gender\r                                _______\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination, and  its holding  is limited to  explicitly race-\r<br>\r<br>          based classifications.  --- U.S. at ---, 115  S.

Where such a disparity has been established, the\r<br>\r<br>          inquiry under prong three is whether the athletics interests  and\r<br>\r<br>          abilities   of  the   underrepresented  gender   are   fully  and\r<br>\r<br>          effectively accommodated, such that  the institution may be found\r<br>\r<br>          to comply with Title IX, notwithstanding the disparity.23  \r<br>\r<br>                      Of course,  a remedy that requires  an institution to\r<br>\r<br>          cut, add, or elevate the  status of athletes or entire teams  may\r<br>\r<br>          impact the genders differently, but this will be so only if there\r<br>\r<br>          is   a   gender-based  disparity   with   respect  to   athletics\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities to  begin with, which  is the only  circumstance in\r<br>\r<br>          which  prong three  comes into play.

In this way, Brown could\r<br>                      easily achieve prong three's  standard of\r<br>                      \"full and effective accommodation  of the\r<br>                      underrepresented sex.\"  This remedy would\r<br>                      entail   upgrading   the   positions   of\r<br>                      approximately  40  women.  In   order  to\r<br>                      finance   the   40   additional   women's\r<br>                      positions, Brown certainly will  not have\r<br>                      to  eliminate as  many as  the 213  men's\r<br>                      positions that would be cut under Brown's\r<br>                      Phase  II  proposal.    Thus,  Brown will\r<br>                      fully comply with Title IX by meeting the\r<br>                      standards   of   prong   three,   without\r<br>                      approaching satisfaction of the standards\r<br>                      of prong one.  \r<br>\r<br>                      It is  clearly in  the  best interest  of\r<br>                      both the male and the  female athletes to\r<br>                      have an increase in women's opportunities\r<br>                      and   a   small    decrease   in    men's\r<br>                      opportunities, if necessary, rather than,\r<br>                      as  under Brown's  plan,  no increase  in\r                                                __\r<br>                      women's   opportunities   and   a   large\r                                                          _____\r<br>                      decrease    in    men's    opportunities.\r<br>                      Expanding women's  athletic opportunities\r<br>                      in  areas where  there is  proven ability\r<br>                      and interest is the very purpose of Title\r<br>                      IX  and  the simplest,  least disruptive,\r<br>                      route to Title IX compliance at Brown.\r<br>\r<br>          Id. at 11-12.\r          ___\r<br>\r<br>                      The  district  court  ordered Brown  to  \"elevate and\r<br>\r<br>          maintain women's gymnastics, women's  water polo, women's skiing,\r<br>\r<br>          and women's fencing to university-funded varsity status.\"  Id. at\r                                                                     ___\r<br>\r<br>          12.

Indeed, the plan\r<br>\r<br>          is replete with argumentative  statements more appropriate for an\r<br>\r<br>          appellate brief.  It  is obvious that Brown's plan  was addressed\r<br>\r<br>          to this court,  rather than to offering a  workable solution to a\r<br>\r<br>          difficult problem.\r<br>\r<br>                      It  is clear, nevertheless,  that Brown's proposal to\r<br>\r<br>          cut men's teams is a permissible means of effectuating compliance\r<br>\r<br>          with  the statute.   Thus,  although  we understand  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's reasons  for substituting  its own specific  relief under\r<br>\r<br>          the circumstances at the time, and although the district  court's\r<br>\r<br>          remedy  is within  the statutory  margins and  constitutional, we\r<br>\r<br>          think that  the district court  was wrong  to reject  out-of-hand\r<br>\r<br>          Brown's alternative plan  to reduce the  number of men's  varsity\r<br>\r<br>          teams.  After all,  the district court itself stated that  one of\r<br>\r<br>          the  compliance options available to  Brown under Title  IX is to\r<br>\r<br>          \"demote or  eliminate the  requisite number of  men's positions.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Cohen III, 879 F.

Our respect for academic freedom\r          _________\r<br>\r<br>          and  reluctance  to  interject  ourselves  into  the  conduct  of\r<br>\r<br>          university  affairs counsels  that we  give universities  as much\r<br>\r<br>          freedom as possible in conducting their operations consonant with\r<br>\r<br>          constitutional  and statutory limits.

The context of\r<br>\r<br>          the  case has  changed in  two significant  respects since  Brown\r<br>\r<br>          presented its original plan.  First, the substantive issues  have\r<br>\r<br>          been decided adversely to Brown.  Brown is no longer an appellant\r<br>\r<br>          seeking a favorable result in the Court  of Appeals.  Second, the\r<br>\r<br>          district  court is not under  time constraints to  consider a new\r<br>\r<br>          plan and fashion a remedy so as to expedite appeal.  Accordingly,\r<br>\r<br>          we remand the case to the district court so that Brown can submit\r<br>\r<br>          a  further plan for its consideration.  In all other respects the\r<br>\r<br>          judgment  of the  district court  is  affirmed.   The preliminary\r<br>\r<br>          injunction issued by the district court in Cohen I,  809 F.

These Olympians represent the first full generation\r<br>\r<br>          of  women  to  grow  up  under  the  aegis  of  Title  IX.    The\r<br>\r<br>          unprecedented  success  of these  athletes  is due,  in  no small\r<br>\r<br>          measure, to Title IX's beneficent  effects on women's sports,  as\r<br>\r<br>          the athletes themselves have  acknowledged time and again.   What\r<br>\r<br>          stimulated  this  remarkable change  in  the  quality of  women's\r<br>\r<br>          athletic  competition  was not  a  sudden,  anomalous upsurge  in\r<br>\r<br>          women's interest  in sports,  but the  enforcement of  Title IX's\r<br>\r<br>          mandate of gender equity in sports.

The   fact  of  gender-conscious\r<br>\r<br>          classification, even with equal  enforcement with respect to both\r<br>\r<br>          genders, requires  the application of a higher  level of scrutiny\r<br>\r<br>          than  rational  basis   review.    We  cannot   pretend  that  an\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation of a statute that contains explicit categorization\r<br>\r<br>          according  to gender  and that  has intentional  gender-conscious\r<br>\r<br>          effect does not represent  gender-based government action.

Prong One\r                      1. Prong One\r<br>\r<br>                    A central issue  in this  case is the  manner in  which\r<br>\r<br>          athletic  \"participation opportunities\" are  counted.  During the\r<br>\r<br>          1990-91  academic year,  Brown fielded  16 men s  and  15 women s\r<br>\r<br>          varsity teams on  which 566 men and  328 women participated.   By\r<br>\r<br>          the 1993-94 year, there were 12 university-funded men s teams and\r<br>\r<br>          13 university funded women s teams.  These teams included 479 men\r<br>\r<br>          and 312 women.   Based  on an analysis  of membership in  varsity\r<br>\r<br>          teams,  the  district  court   concluded  that  there  existed  a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -90-\r                                         -90-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          disparity   between   female  participation   in  intercollegiate\r<br>\r<br>          athletics and female student enrollment.\r<br>\r<br>                    Even assuming that membership numbers in varsity sports\r<br>\r<br>          is a  reasonable proxy for participation opportunities  -- a view\r<br>\r<br>          with which I do not concur -- contact sports should be eliminated\r<br>\r<br>          from  the  calculus.   The regulation  at  34 C.F.R.    106.41(b)\r<br>\r<br>          (1995) provides that an academic institution may operate separate\r<br>\r<br>          teams  for members of each sex \"where  selection of such teams is\r<br>\r<br>          based  upon  competitive  skill or  the  activity  involved  is a\r<br>\r<br>          contact sport.\"  34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).  When a team is sponsored\r<br>\r<br>          only  for one sex, however, and where \"athletic opportunities for\r<br>\r<br>          members  of that sex have previously been limited, members of the\r<br>\r<br>          excluded  sex must  be allowed  to try-out  for the  team offered\r<br>\r<br>          unless  the sport  involved is  a contact  sport,\" id.  (emphasis\r          ________________________________________________   ___\r<br>\r<br>          added).   The  regulation, therefore,  allows schools  to operate\r<br>\r<br>          single-sex  teams  in contact  sports.  In counting participation\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities,  therefore, it does  not make sense  to include in\r<br>\r<br>          the  calculus  athletes  participating  in  contact  sports  that\r<br>\r<br>          include only men s teams.   For example, if a  university chooses\r<br>\r<br>          to  sponsor a football  team, it is  permitted to  sponsor only a\r<br>\r<br>          men s team.   Not  all sports  are  the same  and the  university\r<br>\r<br>          should be given the flexibility to determine which activities are\r<br>\r<br>          most  beneficial  to  its student  body.    By  including in  its\r<br>\r<br>          accounting a  contact sport that  requires very large  numbers of\r<br>\r<br>          participants, e.g., football, the district court skews the number\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -91-\r                                         -91-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          of  athletic  participants  --   making  it  impossible  for  the\r<br>\r<br>          university to  provide  both men's  and  women's teams  in  other\r<br>\r<br>          sports.\r<br>\r<br>                    If  the  athletes competing  in  sports  for which  the\r<br>\r<br>          university is  permitted to  field single-sex teams  are excluded\r<br>\r<br>          from the  calculation of  participation rates, the  proportion of\r<br>\r<br>          women  participants would  increase  dramatically  and prong  one\r<br>\r<br>          might be  satisfied.  If so, the inquiry ends and Brown should be\r<br>\r<br>          judged to be in compliance.\r<br>\r<br>                      2. Prong Two\r                      2. Prong Two\r<br>\r<br>                    The  district court concluded, and the majority appears\r<br>\r<br>          to  agree, that Brown failed to satisfy prong two because \"merely\r<br>\r<br>          reducing program offerings to the overrepresented gender does not\r<br>\r<br>          constitute  program expansion  for the  underrepresented gender.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Majority Opinion at  18.  This  is a curious  result because  the\r<br>\r<br>          entire three-prong test is based on relative participation rates.\r                                              ________\r<br>\r<br>          Prong one, for example, requires that participation opportunities\r<br>\r<br>          be provided  proportionately to enrollment, but  does not mandate\r<br>\r<br>          any absolute number of such opportunities.   The district court s\r<br>\r<br>          conclusion with  respect to  prong two, however,  implies that  a\r<br>\r<br>          school  must not only demonstrate that the proportion of women in\r<br>\r<br>          their program  is growing over time,  it must also show  that the\r<br>\r<br>          absolute number of women participating is increasing.26\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            26.  This  requirement presents  a  dilemma for  a school  in\r<br>            which  women  are  less  interested in  athletics,  as  Brown\r<br>            contends is the case.  Under such conditions, a school may be\r<br>\r<br>                                         -92-\r                                         -92-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Under  the  district court's  interpretation,  a school\r<br>\r<br>          facing  budgetary constraints must, in order to comply with prong\r<br>\r<br>          two, increase the opportunities available to the underrepresented\r               ________\r<br>\r<br>          gender,  even  if  it  cannot  afford  to  do  so.   Rather  than\r<br>\r<br>          respecting  the school s  right to  determine the  role athletics\r<br>\r<br>          will  play in the future --  including reducing the opportunities\r<br>\r<br>          available  to   the  formerly  overrepresented  gender to  ensure\r<br>\r<br>          proportionate  opportunities  --  the  district   court  and  the\r<br>\r<br>          majority  demand  that  the  absolute  number   of  opportunities\r                                       ________\r<br>\r<br>          provided to the underrepresented  gender be increased.  I  see no\r<br>\r<br>          possible  justification for this interpretation -- the regulation\r<br>\r<br>          is  intended to  protect against  discrimination, not  to promote\r<br>\r<br>          athletics  on  college campuses.   A  school  is not  required to\r<br>\r<br>          sponsor an  athletic program of any  particular size.  It  is not\r<br>\r<br>          for the courts, or  the legislature, for that matter,  to mandate\r<br>\r<br>          programs of a given  size.  The most that can be demanded is that\r<br>\r<br>          athletics be provided in a non-discriminatory manner.\r<br>\r<br>                    Furthermore,  the  claim   that  a  reduction   in  the\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities  given   to  the   overrepresented  gender  is   an\r<br>\r<br>          unacceptable  method of  coming  into compliance  with the  three\r<br>\r<br>          prong test  is contrary  to both  Cohen  II and  comments of  the\r                                            _________\r<br>\r<br>          majority opinion.

Prong Three\r<br>\r<br>                    Prong three of the  three-prong test states that, where\r<br>\r<br>          an institution does not comply with prongs one or two, compliance\r<br>\r<br>          will be assessed on the basis of\r<br>\r<br>                      whether it  can be demonstrated  that the\r<br>                      interests and abilities of the members of\r<br>                      th[e]  [proportionately underrepresented]\r<br>                      sex  have  been  fully   and  effectively\r<br>                      accommodated by the present program.\r<br>\r<br>          44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,418 (December 11, 1979).\r<br>\r<br>                    According  to the  district  court,  Brown's  athletics\r<br>\r<br>          program   violates   prong   three   because   members   of   the\r<br>\r<br>          proportionately underrepresented sex  have demonstrated  interest\r<br>\r<br>          sufficient for a  university-funded varsity team  that is not  in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -94-\r                                         -94-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          fact being funded.  The district court asserts that this is not a\r<br>\r<br>          quota.   Brown, on  the other  hand, argues that  prong three  is\r<br>\r<br>          satisfied  when (1) the interests and abilities of members of the\r<br>\r<br>          proportionately underrepresented gender  (2) are accommodated  to\r<br>\r<br>          the same degree as the proportionately overrepresented gender.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  district  court's  narrow, literal  interpretation\r<br>\r<br>          should  be  rejected  because  prong  three  cannot  be  read  in\r<br>\r<br>          isolation.   First,  as Brown  points  out, the  Regulation  that\r<br>\r<br>          includes prong three provides that, in assessing compliance under\r<br>\r<br>          the regulation, \"the governing principle in this area is that the\r<br>\r<br>          athletic interests and  abilities of male and female  students be\r          _________________________________________________________________\r<br>\r<br>          equally  effectively accommodated.\"    Policy Interpretation,  44\r          _________________________________      _____________________\r<br>\r<br>          Fed.  Reg. 71,413, 71,414.  Thus, Brown contends, to meet \"fully\"\r<br>\r<br>          -- in  an absolute  sense --  the interests  and abilities  of an\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresented   gender,  while   unmet   interest  among   the\r<br>\r<br>          overrepresented  gender continues, would contravene the governing\r<br>\r<br>          principle of \"equally effective accommodat[ion]\" of the interests\r<br>\r<br>          and abilities of students of both genders.\r<br>\r<br>                    It  is   also  worthwhile  to  note   that  to  \"fully\"\r<br>\r<br>          accommodate the  interests and abilities of  the underrepresented\r<br>\r<br>          sex  is  an extraordinarily  high  --  perhaps impossibly  so  --\r<br>\r<br>          requirement.   How could an academic institution with a large and\r<br>\r<br>          diverse  student  body  ever  \"fully\"  accommodate  the  athletic\r<br>\r<br>          interests  of its  students?

To read fully in an\r<br>\r<br>          absolute sense would make the third prong virtually impossible to\r<br>\r<br>          satisfy and, therefore, an irrelevant addition to the test.\r<br>\r<br>                    This  difficulty  was  recognized in  Cohen  II,  which\r                                                          _________\r<br>\r<br>          stated  that \"the mere fact  that there are  some female students\r<br>\r<br>          interested  in a sport does not ipso  facto require the school to\r                                          ___________\r<br>\r<br>          provide  a varsity  team  in  order  to  comply  with  the  third\r<br>\r<br>          benchmark.\"  Cohen II 991 F.2d at 898.

A \"viable\" tennis\r<br>\r<br>          team may require only a single player.  The same could be said of\r<br>\r<br>          any individual  sport, including golf, track  and field, cycling,\r<br>\r<br>          fencing,  archery, and  so  on.   Therefore,  we still  have  the\r<br>\r<br>          problem  that  to  \"fully   accommodate\"  the  interests  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          underrepresented sex may be impossible under the district court's\r<br>\r<br>          interpretation.\r<br>\r<br>                    In light of the above, Brown argues that prong three is\r<br>\r<br>          in  fact ambiguous with respect  to whether \"fully\"  means (1) an\r<br>\r<br>          institution must meet 100% of the underrepresented gender's unmet\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -96-\r                                         -96-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          reasonable interest and ability, or (2)  an institution must meet\r<br>\r<br>          the  underrepresented  gender's  unmet  reasonable  interest  and\r<br>\r<br>          ability as fully as it meets those of the overrepresented gender.\r<br>\r<br>          I  agree  with  Brown  that,  in  the  context  of  OCR's  Policy\r<br>\r<br>          Interpretation, prong three is susceptible  to at least these two\r<br>\r<br>          plausible interpretations.    \r<br>\r<br>                    Additionally, section 1681(a),  a provision enacted  by\r<br>\r<br>          Congress as part of  Title IX itself, casts doubt on the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's reading of prong three.   20 U.S.C.   1681(a) (1988).  As\r<br>\r<br>          Brown points out, Title IX, of which the Policy Interpretation is\r<br>\r<br>          an   administrative   interpretation,   contains  language   that\r<br>\r<br>          prohibits the ordering of preferential  treatment on the basis of\r<br>\r<br>          gender due  to a failure of a program to substantially mirror the\r<br>\r<br>          gender ratio  of an institution.

First,  the  district court's  interpretation creates  a\r<br>\r<br>          quota  scheme.   Second,  even assuming  such  a quota  scheme is\r<br>\r<br>          otherwise  constitutional,  appellees  have  not  pointed  to  an\r<br>\r<br>          \"exceedingly  persuasive justification,\" see  Virginia, 116 S.Ct.\r                                                   ___  ________\r<br>\r<br>          at 2274, for this particular quota scheme.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -98-\r                                         -98-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      1. The Quota\r                      1. The Quota\r<br>\r<br>                    I  believe that the  three prong test,  as the district\r<br>\r<br>          court interprets  it, is a  quota.   I am in  square disagreement\r<br>\r<br>          with the majority, who believe that \"[n]o aspect of the  Title IX\r<br>\r<br>          regime  at issue  in  this  case  .  .  .  mandates  gender-based\r<br>\r<br>          preferences or quotas.\"   Majority  Opinion at 29.   Put  another\r<br>\r<br>          way,  I agree  that  \"Title  IX  is  not  an  affirmative  action\r<br>\r<br>          statute,\"  id., but I believe  that is exactly  what the district\r                     ___\r<br>\r<br>          court has made of it.   As interpreted by the district court, the\r<br>\r<br>          test constitutes an affirmative action, quota-based scheme.\r<br>\r<br>                    I  am less interested  in the actual  term \"quota\" than\r<br>\r<br>          the legally cognizable characteristics that render a quota scheme\r<br>\r<br>          impermissible.   And  those characteristics  are present  here in\r<br>\r<br>          spades.  I  am not persuaded by the majority's  argument that the\r<br>\r<br>          three-part test does not  constitute a quota because it  does not\r<br>\r<br>          permit an agency or court to find a violation solely on the basis\r<br>\r<br>          of prong one of the test; instead,  an institution must also fail\r<br>\r<br>          prongs  two and  three.   As Brown  rightly argues,  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's  application of  the three-prong  test requires  Brown to\r<br>\r<br>          allocate its athletic resources to meet the as-yet-unmet interest\r<br>\r<br>          of  a member  of the  underrepresented sex,  women in  this case,\r<br>\r<br>          while   simultaneously  neglecting   any  unmet   interest  among\r<br>\r<br>          individuals of the overrepresented  sex.  To the extent  that the\r<br>\r<br>          rate of interest in  athletics diverges between men and  women at\r<br>\r<br>          any   institution,  the  district  court's  interpretation  would\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -99-\r                                         -99-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          require  that  such  an  institution  treat  an  individual  male\r<br>\r<br>          student's  athletic interest and  an individual  female student's\r<br>\r<br>          athletic   interest   completely   differently:   one   student's\r<br>\r<br>          reasonable interest would have  to be met, by law,  while meeting\r                                                     ______\r<br>\r<br>          the other  student's interest  would only  aggravate the  lack of\r<br>\r<br>          proportionality  giving rise to the  legal duty.   \"The injury in\r<br>\r<br>          cases  of  this kind  is  that  a 'discriminatory  classification\r<br>\r<br>          prevent[s] . . . competition on an equal footing.'\"  Adarand, 115\r                                                               _______\r<br>\r<br>          S.

The\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>          logic of this position escapes me.  A school can satisfy the test\r<br>\r<br>          in  three ways.   The first prong  is met if  the school provides\r<br>\r<br>          participation  opportunities  for  male and  female  students  in\r<br>\r<br>          numbers substantially  proportionate to their enrollments.   This\r<br>\r<br>          prong surely requires statistical balancing.  The second prong is\r<br>\r<br>          satisfied if an institution that cannot meet prong one can show a\r<br>\r<br>          \"continuing practice  of program expansion  which is demonstrably\r<br>\r<br>          responsive  to  the  developing  interest and  abilities  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          members  of the underrepresented sex.\"   44 Fed.  Reg. at 71,418.\r<br>\r<br>          It can  hardly be  denied  that this  prong requires  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          balancing as it is essentially a test that requires the school to\r<br>\r<br>          show that  it is moving in the  direction of satisfying the first\r<br>\r<br>          prong.  Establishing that a school is moving inexorably closer to\r<br>\r<br>          satisfying a  requirement that demands  statistical balancing can\r<br>\r<br>          only be done by  demonstrating an improvement in the  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          balance.    In  other  words,  the  second  prong  also  requires\r<br>\r<br>          balancing.  Finally, the third prong, interpreted as the majority\r<br>\r<br>          advocates, dispenses  with statistical balancing only  because it\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            University  of  Illinois  not  been in  compliance,  lack  of\r                                      ___\r<br>            compliance  with  the three-prong  test  alone  would trigger\r                                                     _____\r<br>            automatic liability,  nor did  the Seventh Circuit  spell out\r<br>            what steps would  have been  required of defendant.

Even a\r<br>\r<br>          single  person   with   a  reasonable   unmet  interest   defeats\r<br>\r<br>          compliance.    This standard,  in  fact,  goes farther  than  the\r<br>\r<br>          straightforward  quota test  of  prong  one.   According  to  the\r<br>\r<br>          district court,  the unmet interests of  the underrepresented sex\r<br>\r<br>          must be completely accommodated before any of the interest of the\r                  __________                     ___\r<br>\r<br>          overrepresented gender can be accommodated.28\r<br>\r<br>                    A pragmatic  overview of the effect  of the three-prong\r<br>\r<br>          test leads me to reject the majority's claim that the three-prong\r<br>\r<br>          test  does not  amount to  a quota  because it  involves multiple\r<br>\r<br>          prongs.  In  my view it  is the result of  the test, and  not the\r<br>\r<br>          number of steps involved, that should determine if a quota system\r<br>\r<br>          exists.   Regardless  of how  many steps  are involved,  the fact\r<br>\r<br>          remains  that  the  test  requires   proportionate  participation\r<br>\r<br>          opportunities for both sexes (prong one) unless one sex is simply\r<br>\r<br>          not  interested in participating (prong  three).  It  seems to me\r<br>\r<br>          that a quota with an exception for  situations in which there are\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            28.  The  problem  with   the  majority s  argument   can  be\r<br>            illustrated  with  a hypothetical  college  admissions policy\r<br>            that would require proportionality  between the gender  ratio\r<br>            of the  local student  aged population and  that of  admitted\r<br>            students.   This  policy is  comparable to  prong one  of the\r<br>            three prong test and is, without a doubt, a quota.   It is no\r<br>            less  a quota if an exception exists for schools whose gender\r<br>            ratio  differs from  that of the  local population  but which\r<br>            admit  every applicant  of the  underrepresented gender.   It\r<br>            remains a quota because  the school is forced to  admit every\r<br>            female  applicant until it  reaches the requisite proportion.\r<br>            Similarly, the  district court's interpretation  requires the\r<br>            school to  accommodate the interests of  every female student\r<br>            until proportionality is reached.\r<br>\r<br>                                        -102-\r                                        -102-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          insufficient interested students to  allow the school to  meet it\r<br>\r<br>          remains  a  quota.    All of  the  negative  effects  of a  quota\r<br>\r<br>          remain,29 and the school  can escape the quota under  prong three\r<br>\r<br>          only  by offering  preferential treatment to  the group  that has\r<br>\r<br>          demonstrated less interest in athletics.\r<br>\r<br>                      2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r                      2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r<br>\r<br>                    In view  of the  quota scheme  adopted by the  district\r<br>\r<br>          court, and Congress' specific disavowal of any  intent to require\r<br>\r<br>          quotas as part of Title  IX, appellees have not met their  burden\r<br>\r<br>          of  showing an  \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for this\r<br>\r<br>          gender-conscious exercise of  government authority.

Nor  does the  second  prong  of  the  test  change  the\r<br>            analysis.  That prong merely recognizes that a school may not\r<br>            be able  to  meet the  quotas  of the  first or  third  prong\r<br>            immediately,  and  therefore  deems  it  sufficient  to  show\r<br>            program  expansion that is responsive to the interests of the\r<br>            underrepresented sex.\r<br>\r<br>                                        -103-\r                                        -103-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Neither   appellees   nor  the   district   court  have\r<br>\r<br>          demonstrated  an \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for the\r<br>\r<br>          government action  that the district  court has directed  in this\r<br>\r<br>          case.    In  fact,   appellees  have  failed  to  point   to  any\r                                                                        ___\r<br>\r<br>          congressional  statement or  indication  of  intent  regarding  a\r<br>\r<br>          proportional  representation scheme  as applied  by the  district\r<br>\r<br>          court.   While  they  point to  Congress'  decision  to  delegate\r<br>\r<br>          authority to the  relevant agencies,  this does not  amount to  a\r<br>\r<br>          genuine  --  that is,  not hypothesized  or  invented in  view of\r<br>\r<br>          litigation, id.  at 2275 --  exceedingly persuasive justification\r                      ___\r<br>\r<br>          in light of section 1681(b)'s \"no  quota\" provision.

Evidentiary Issues\r<br>\r<br>                    In  disputes  over  the  representation  of   women  in\r<br>\r<br>          athletic  programs, it  is  inevitable that  statistical evidence\r<br>\r<br>          will  be relevant.    There  is simply  no  other  way to  assess\r<br>\r<br>          participation  rates,   interest  levels,  and  abilities.    The\r<br>\r<br>          majority  opinion, however,  offers  inconsistent  guidance  with\r<br>\r<br>          respect to the role of  statistics in Title IX claims.   Early in\r<br>\r<br>          the opinion,  the majority  approvingly cites to  the statistical\r<br>\r<br>          evaluations conducted  in  Cohen  I, Cohen  II,  and  Cohen  III.\r                                     ________  _________        __________\r<br>\r<br>          Majority  Opinion at 8-10.   The figures  in question demonstrate\r<br>\r<br>          that women s participation in athletics is less than proportional\r<br>\r<br>          to their enrollment.   Later  in the opinion,  however, when  the\r<br>\r<br>          level  of interest among  women at Brown  is at  issue, the court\r<br>\r<br>          adopts  a   much  more  critical  attitude   towards  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          evidence: \"[T]here exists the  danger that, rather than providing\r<br>\r<br>          a  true  measure  of  women s  interest  in  sports,  statistical\r<br>\r<br>          evidence purporting to reflect women s interest instead  provides\r<br>\r<br>          only a  measure of the very  discrimination that is and  has been\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                        -105-\r                                        -105-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          the  basis for women s lack of opportunity.\"  Majority Opinion at\r<br>\r<br>          53.   In other words, evidence of differential levels of interest\r<br>\r<br>          is not to be credited because it may simply reflect the result of\r<br>\r<br>          past discrimination.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  refusal to  accept surveys  of interest  levels as\r<br>\r<br>          evidence of interest raises the question of what indicators might\r<br>\r<br>          be used.  The majority offers no guidance to a  school seeking to\r<br>\r<br>          assess  the levels  of interest  of its  students.   Although the\r<br>\r<br>          three-prong  test, even  as  interpreted by  the district  court,\r<br>\r<br>          appears to  allow the school  the opportunity to  show a lack  of\r<br>\r<br>          interest, the majority rejects the best -- and perhaps the only -\r<br>\r<br>          - mechanism for making such a showing.\r<br>\r<br>                    Brown claims that the district court erred in excluding\r<br>\r<br>          evidence pertaining to the relative athletic interests of men and\r<br>\r<br>          women  at the  university.   Brown sought  to introduce  the NCAA\r<br>\r<br>          Gender Equity Study and  the results of an undergraduate  poll on\r<br>\r<br>          student  interest in athletics, but  was not permitted  to do so.\r<br>\r<br>          The majority is unsympathetic to Brown's claim that the disparity\r<br>\r<br>          between  athletic  opportunities  for  men and  women  reflect  a\r<br>\r<br>          gender-based  difference in  interest  levels.   Indeed,  despite\r<br>\r<br>          Brown's  attempt to present evidence in support of its claim, the\r<br>\r<br>          majority   characterizes   Brown's  argument   as   an  \"unproven\r<br>\r<br>          assertion.\"  Majority Opinion at 51.30\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            30.  Among  the   evidence  submitted   by  Brown   are:  (i)\r<br>            admissions data showing greater athletic interest among  male\r<br>            applicants than  female applicants;  (ii) college  board data\r<br>\r<br>                                        -106-\r                                        -106-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Furthermore, the majority recognizes  that institutions\r<br>\r<br>          are  entitled  to  use  any  nondiscriminatory  method  of  their\r<br>\r<br>          choosing to determine athletic interests.  Majority Opinion at 53\r<br>\r<br>          n.15.  If  statistical evidence of  interest levels is not  to be\r<br>\r<br>          considered by courts,  however, there  is no way  for schools  to\r<br>\r<br>          determine whether they are in compliance.  Any studies or surveys\r<br>\r<br>          they might conduct in order to assess their own compliance would,\r<br>\r<br>          in  the event of litigation, be deemed irrelevant.  Regardless of\r<br>\r<br>          the  efforts made by the  academic institution, the  specter of a\r<br>\r<br>          lawsuit would be ever-present.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  addition, the majority has put the power to control\r<br>\r<br>          athletics and the provision of athletic resources in the hands of\r<br>\r<br>          the  underrepresented gender.   Virtually  every other  aspect of\r<br>\r<br>          college life is  entrusted to the institution,  but athletics has\r<br>\r<br>          now  been carved  out as an  exception and  the university  is no\r<br>\r<br>          longer in full  control of its program.   Unless the  two genders\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            showing  greater  athletic interest  and  prior participation\r<br>            rates by prospective male  applicants than female applicants;\r<br>            (iii)  data  from  the  Cooperative   Institutional  Research\r<br>            Program at UCLA  indicating greater  athletic interest  among\r<br>            men  than women; (iv) an independent  telephone survey of 500\r<br>            randomly  selected  Brown  undergraduates  that  reveals that\r<br>            Brown offers  women participation opportunities in  excess of\r<br>            their  representation in  the  pool of  interested, qualified\r<br>            students; (v)  intramural and  club participation  rates that\r<br>            demonstrate  higher participation rates among men than women;\r<br>            (vi)  walk-on  and try-out  numbers  that  reflect a  greater\r<br>            interest   among  men   than   women;   (vii)   high   school\r<br>            participation  rates   that  show   a  much  lower   rate  of\r<br>            participation among females than among males; (viii) the NCAA\r<br>            Gender Equity  Committee data  showing that women  across the\r<br>            country participate in athletics at a lower rate than men.\r<br>\r<br>                                        -107-\r                                        -107-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          participate equally in athletics, members of the underrepresented\r<br>\r<br>          sex would  have the ability to demand a varsity level team at any\r<br>\r<br>          time  if they can show sufficient interest.  Apparently no weight\r<br>\r<br>          is given  to the sustainability of the  interest, the cost of the\r<br>\r<br>          sport, the  university s view on  the desirability of  the sport,\r<br>\r<br>          and so on.\r<br>\r<br>                              IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r                              IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r<br>\r<br>                    Finally,  it  is  important  to   remember  that  Brown\r<br>\r<br>          University  is  a  private  institution  with a  constitutionally\r<br>\r<br>          protected  First  Amendment  right  to  choose  its   curriculum.\r<br>\r<br>          Athletics  are part of that curriculum.  Although the protections\r<br>\r<br>          of the First Amendment cannot  be used to justify discrimination,\r<br>\r<br>          this  court should  not forget that  it has  a duty  to protect a\r<br>\r<br>          private  institution s   right  to  mould  its   own  educational\r<br>\r<br>          environment.\r<br>\r<br>                    The majority pays  lip service to these concerns in the\r<br>\r<br>          final pages of its long opinion, stating  that \" we are a society\r<br>\r<br>          that  cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that universities\r<br>\r<br>          deserve great leeway in their operations. \"   Majority Opinion at\r<br>\r<br>          69  (quoting Cohen II,  991 F.2d at 906),  and \"[o]ur respect for\r                       ________\r<br>\r<br>          academic freedom  and reluctance to interject  ourselves into the\r<br>\r<br>          conduct of university affairs  counsels that we give universities\r<br>\r<br>          as  much freedom as possible.\"   Majority Opinion at 75.  Despite\r<br>\r<br>          these statements, however, the majority in its opinion today, and\r<br>\r<br>          the  district  court   before  it,  have  failed  to  give  Brown\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                        -108-\r                                        -108-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          University  freedom  to craft  its  own athletic  program  and to\r<br>\r<br>          choose  the  priorities of  that  program.    Instead, they  have\r<br>\r<br>          established a  legal rule that  straightjackets college athletics\r<br>\r<br>          programs by curtailing  their freedom to  choose the sports  they\r<br>\r<br>          offer. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                        -109-\r                                        -109-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",
