(\"SCI\") made negligent representations to\r\nappellees Angel S. Galvan, Maria Guadalupe Galvan and Angelita S.\r\nBenavides about the availability of cemetery plots for sale, and that SCI\r\nmade a fraudulent representation to Angel S. Galvan and Maria\r\nGuadalupe Galvan about the location of their son's burial plot.  SCI\r\nraises eleven points of error.  We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBecause appellants attack the legal and factual sufficiency of the\r\nevidence, and the facts to this case are somewhat complicated, we will\r\naddress the facts in some detail.  In 1989, Angel S. Galvan and Maria\r\nGuadalupe Galvan (\"the Galvans\") purchased two cemetery plots from\r\nSCI.  In 1994, their grandson Marc died and was buried in one of these\r\ntwo plots.  After Marc was buried, SCI offered to sell Angelita S.\r\nBenavides (\"Benavides\"), mother of Marc and daughter of the Galvans,\r\nseven additional plots close to where Marc was buried.  Benavides\r\ncontracted for three of the plots, her sister Maria Anita Reyna\r\ncontracted for two plots, and the Galvans contracted for two plots. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAccording to SCI's records, when SCI contracted to sell these\r\nseven plots, each plot was already owned by Noelia DeLeon.<sup>(2)</sup> \r\nBenavides and her sister both lost their plots when each was unable to\r\nmaintain regular payments on the plots.  On September 19, 1997,\r\nBenavides again purchased two of the three plots that, according to\r\nSCI's records and DeLeon, were already sold to DeLeon.  Again,\r\nBenavides was unable to maintain consistent payments and lost\r\nownership rights to the cemetery plots.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn 1995, Benavides purchased a separate plot, next to her son\r\nMarc's grave, but lost it because she could not pay for it.  In February\r\n1997, Benavides again purchased this plot. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOn September 2, 1997 Jose Angel Galvan, the Galvans' son, and\r\nBenavides's brother, died.  According to the testimony at trial, Yolanda\r\nGalvan, Jose Angel Galvan's widow, sent her father-in-law, appellee\r\nAngel Galvan, as her agent to handle the arrangements with SCI.  Angel\r\nGalvan testified that an SCI employee told him that his plots (which\r\nwere actually owned by DeLeon) were a few feet away from his\r\ngrandson Marc.  Based on this information, Angel Galvan instructed SCI\r\nto bury Jose Angel Galvan in one of his plots.  In order to do this, SCI\r\nrequired that the Galvans transfer their ownership rights in another plot\r\nbecause SCI requires that payment be made in full before interment,\r\nand the Galvans had not completed payments on the plot where Jose\r\nAngel was to be buried.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAccording to the testimony of Yolanda Galvan, that same day the\r\nsame SCI sales representative asked Yolanda where she wanted Jose\r\nAngel Galvan buried.  Yolanda had allowed Angel to make all of the\r\narrangements, but then, because she wanted her husband to be buried\r\nwhere she could later be buried next to him, allowed the SCI sales\r\nrepresentative to sell her another plot.  Angel testified that he was not\r\npresent at this time, having left to buy a suit for his son to be buried in.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSoon thereafter, the Galvans signed a quit-claim deed to transfer\r\nownership of the plot where Jose Angel was going to be buried to\r\nYolanda .  SCI provided the deed for their signature after having made\r\ndifferent representations to the Galvans and Yolanda as to where Jose\r\nAngel  would be buried.  The Galvans did not know that their son was\r\ngoing to be buried in a different location than had been represented to\r\nthem before they signed the deed.  The deed showed that the cemetery\r\nplot was actually much further from Marc than the Galvans understood\r\nit to be.  The Galvans first realized this when they arrived at the\r\ncemetery for the burial.  Jose Angel was buried in the spot farther away\r\nfrom Marc, but, after being informed of this misunderstanding, SCI\r\nagreed to reinter Jose Angel next to Marc.  Only after Jose Angel was\r\nreinterred, did SCI notify anyone that the plot was actually owned by\r\nDeLeon.  Jose Angel was then buried a third time.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its first issue, SCI argues that the trial court did not have\r\njurisdiction to hear this case without Yolanda as an indispensable party\r\nto the suit, because, as Jose Angel's surviving spouse, only she can\r\nbring a claim for the wrongful burial, disinterment or exhumation of\r\nJose Angel's body.  <em>See </em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§ \r\n711.002(a),(d), 711.004(a),(b) (Vernon Supp. 2001).  SCI raises this\r\nissue for the first time on appeal.  SCI did not plead that the decedent's\r\nwife was a necessary party as required by the rules of civil procedure. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 39. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tPrior to the amendment of rule 39 in 1971, a failure to include an\r\nindispensable party was fundamental error which could be raised to\r\nattack the court's jurisdiction on appeal.  <em>See e.g.</em>, <em>Petroleum Anchor\r\nEquip., Inc. v. Tyra</em>, 406 S.W.2d 891, 893 (Tex. 1965);<em> Sharpe v.\r\nLandowners Oil Ass'n</em>, 92 S.W.2d 435, 436 (Tex. 1936).  The\r\namendment to rule 39 in 1971 rendered inoperative most of the\r\npotential for fundamental error due to failure to include an indispensable\r\nparty.  <em>McBurnett v. Gordon</em>, 534 S.W.2d 370, 372 (Tex. Civ. App.--Beaumont 1976, pet ref'd n.r.e.).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t\"Under the provisions of our present Rule 39 it would be rare\r\nindeed if there were a person whose presence was so indispensable in\r\nthe sense that his absence deprives the court of jurisdiction to\r\nadjudicate between the parties already joined.\"  <em>Cooper v. Texas Gulf\r\nIndus., Inc.</em>, 513 S.W.2d 200, 203 (Tex. 1974); <em>see Cox v. Johnson</em>, 638\r\nS.W.2d 867, 867-68 (Tex. 1982) (supreme court \"disapproved\" of this\r\nCourt's holding that failure to join a necessary party was fundamental\r\nerror, but denied the writ of error because of other meritorious issues\r\nin the appeal).  Fundamental error survives today only in those rare\r\ninstances where the record shows on its face that the court lacked\r\njurisdiction or that the public interest is directly and adversely affected\r\nas that interest is declared in the statutes and constitution of this state. \r\n<em>Pirtle v. Gregory</em>, 629 S.W.2d 919, 919 (Tex. 1982); <em>see e.g. Eddows v.\r\nOswald</em>, 621 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1981, no writ)\r\n(brother of alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald not allowed to get\r\ninjunction preventing wife of deceased from exhuming body to perform\r\nautopsy when wife had not delegated any of her authority to anyone\r\nand clearly wanted the body disinterred).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe supreme court in <em>Cooper </em>explained, \"Contrary to our emphasis\r\nunder Rule 39 before it was amended, today's concern is less that of\r\nthe jurisdiction of a court to proceed and more a question of whether\r\nthe court ought to proceed with those who are present.\"  <em>Cooper</em>, 513\r\nS.W.2d at 204.  If the trial court had the opportunity to rule on the\r\njoinder of decedent's spouse, it could have determined \"whether in\r\nequity and good conscience the action should proceed among the\r\nparties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person [decedent's\r\nspouse] being thus regarded as indispensable.\"  Tex. R. Civ. P. 39(b).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOne of the practical factors an appellate court can take into\r\nconsideration in holding that an absent party was not jurisdictionally\r\nindispensable is whether or not the case \"had actually been tried as to\r\nthose parties who were present and <em>there was no objection at the trial\r\nlevel concerning the nonjoinder of a party</em>. . . . [A]t the appellate stage\r\nthere is reason not to throw away a judgment just because it did not\r\ntheoretically settle the whole controversy.\"  <em>Cooper</em>, 513 S.W.2d at 204\r\n(emphasis added).  Since SCI did not object at the trial level to the\r\nnonjoinder of Yolanda Galvan, it has waived the issue of joinder of the\r\ndecedent's wife.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe absence of the decedent's wife did not deprive the trial court\r\nof jurisdiction between the parties before it.  The Galvans do not argue\r\nthat SCI made negligent representations and committed fraud towards\r\ndecedent's wife; therefore she is not a necessary party to that part of\r\nthe suit.  In regard to the other issues, the trial court resolved the\r\ndispute between the parties before it even if \"it did not theoretically\r\nsettle the whole controversy.\"  <em>Cooper</em>, 513 S.W.2d at 204.  We\r\noverrule SCI's first issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAs part of its second, fourth, fifth and sixth issues, SCI argues that\r\nthe trial court erred by allowing the submission of a single damage\r\nquestion for each plaintiff for multiple theories of recovery.  The jury\r\nwas charged as SCI requested it to be charged.  The charge did not\r\ninclude the submission of a single damage question for each plaintiff for\r\nmultiple theories of recovery.  SCI did not object to the charge.  Error in\r\nthe charge must be preserved by distinctly designating the error and the\r\ngrounds for objection.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 274; <em>Cosgrove v. Grimes</em>, 774\r\nS.W.2d 662, 665-66 (Tex. 1989); <em>Wilgus v. Bond</em>, 730 S.W.2d 670, 672\r\n(Tex. 1987); <em>Lanphier Constr. Co. v. Fowco Constr. Co.</em>, 523 S.W.2d 29,\r\n34 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus Christi 1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  Any possible\r\nerror in the organization of the damages question submitted by SCI is\r\ntherefore not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its second issue, SCI claims that it owed no duty with respect\r\nto the location of the decedent's interment or his disinterment and that\r\nthe evidence is both legally and factually insufficient to support the\r\njury's finding that SCI was negligent with respect to the location of the\r\ndecedent's interment or his disinterment.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWhen reviewing challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence,\r\nwe consider all the evidence and inferences in the record in a light most\r\nfavorable to the party in whose favor the verdict has been rendered and\r\nindulge every reasonable inference in that party's favor.   <em>See Formosa\r\nPlastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Eng'rs &amp; Contractors, Inc</em>., 960 S.W.2d\r\n41, 48 (Tex. 1998).  We overrule such points if the findings are\r\nsupported by more than a scintilla of evidence.  <em>Id</em>.  In contrast, factual\r\nsufficiency challenges require that we consider and balance all the\r\nevidence.  <em>Plas-Tex, Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp.</em>, 772 S.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex.\r\n1989).  We overrule factual insufficiency points of error unless the\r\nevidence supporting a finding is so weak that the finding is against the\r\ngreat weight and preponderance of the evidence and clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.  <em>Ortiz v. Jones</em>, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSCI had a statutory duty to the decedent's spouse.  Tex. Health &amp;\r\nSafety Code Ann. §§ 711.002(a),(d), 711.004(a),(b) (Vernon Supp. 2001). \r\nBut when SCI represented to the Galvans that their son would be buried\r\nat a certain location, and accepted the transfer of the plot the Galvans\r\nhad paid for, SCI assumed a duty to the Galvans to act with due care. \r\n<em>Herman Hosp. v. National Standard Ins. Co.</em>, 776 S.W.2d 249, 253 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied)  (\"It is well settled that\r\neven though one does not have a duty to act, if one acts voluntarily, he\r\nmust do so with due care and is generally liable for negligence\"). \r\nAppellees alleged, and the jury concluded, that SCI breached its duty in\r\nproviding this service.  When SCI acted in response to the Galvans'\r\nrequest to reinter Jose Angel, it likewise assumed a duty of due care. \r\n<em>Id</em>. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe jury heard evidence that Yolanda had agreed to let her father-in-law make the arrangements for her husband's burial, that Angel told\r\nSCI that he was making the arrangements, and that SCI's sales\r\nrepresentative understood that he was making the arrangements.  SCI\r\ncompleted a transaction with Angel for the burial of his son and then\r\ncontracted with Yolanda to bury him elsewhere. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAt least five times SCI represented to the Galvans and Benavides\r\nthat it could sell cemetery plots which, at the time SCI made the\r\nrepresentations, it did not own.  If, while in the course of a business\r\ntransaction, a party supplies false information for the guidance of others\r\nin their business transactions, the party supplying the false information\r\nis subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to the misguided parties\r\nby their justifiable reliance upon the information if the supplying party\r\nfails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or\r\ncommunicating the information.  <em>McCamish, Martin, Brown &amp; Loeffler\r\nv. Appling</em>, 991 S.W.2d 787, 791 (Tex. 1999).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe evidence in support of the jury's finding is more than the\r\nscintilla of evidence required by law.  <em>See Browning-Ferris</em>, 865 S.W.2d\r\nat 928.  The jury's finding is not against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence; nor is it clearly wrong and unjust.  <em>See\r\nOrtiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>.  </em>We overrule SCI's second issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its third issue, SCI argues that the trial court erred in refusing\r\nto allow it to present evidence of appellees' failure to accept a\r\nsettlement offer.  Appellate review of a trial judge's decision to admit\r\nevidence is governed by an abuse of discretion standard.  <em>Jackson v.\r\nVan Winkle</em>, 660 S.W.2d 807, 810 (Tex. 1983);<em> Jones v. Jones</em>, 890\r\nS.W.2d 471, 474 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1994 writ denied).  The\r\nTexas Rules of Evidence provide that:\r\n\r\n</p><p>[e]vidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to\r\nfurnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept,\r\na valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to\r\ncompromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity\r\nor amount is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity\r\nof the claim or its amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Tex. R. Evid. 408.  If SCI had offered to release the contractual\r\nrequirement to make payments without compromise, condition, or\r\nsettlement, such evidence would not be prohibited by rule 408. <em> Gunn\r\nInfinity, Inc. v. O'Bryne</em>, 996 S.W.2d 854, 859 (Tex. 1999) (\"If a\r\ndefendant is truly offering to mitigate, the offer cannot implicitly or\r\nexplicitly seek a release of the plaintiff's claims.  It must be an\r\nunconditional offer to mitigate.\").  Appellees' choice not to accept the\r\nsettlement offer neither negates their contractual obligation to make\r\npayments on the plots nor makes the compromise offer rebuttal to\r\ncounsel's comment that SCI continued to accept such payments.  We\r\nsee no abuse of discretion, and overrule SCI's third issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its fourth issue, SCI argues that there was no evidence, or in the\r\nalternative, legally and factually insufficient evidence of any DTPA\r\nviolations.  The jury found that SCI had violated sections 17.46(b)(5),(7)\r\nand (12) of the DTPA.<sup>(3)</sup>  There was evidence presented to the jury that\r\nSCI made affirmative representations that it would bury Jose Angel at\r\na location and that it then did not do so.  SCI made affirmative\r\nrepresentations that it could reinter Jose Angel at a location where it\r\ncould not because they did not own the location.  SCI made affirmative\r\nrepresentations orally and by written agreement that it could convey\r\ntitle to plots which it did not own.  <em>See Smith v. Herco, Inc.</em>, 900\r\nS.W.2d 852, 858 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1995) (finding of DTPA\r\nviolations where real estate agency made oral and written affirmative\r\nrepresentation of ability to convey clear title, when unknown to the\r\nagency, it could not).  The evidence supporting the jury's finding is\r\nmore than the scintilla of evidence required by law.  <em>See Formosa\r\nPlastics</em>, 960 S.W.2d at 48.  The jury's finding is not against the great\r\nweight and preponderance of the evidence; nor is it clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>.  </em>We overrule SCI's fourth issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its fifth issue, SCI argues that the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the jury's finding that SCI engaged in an\r\nunconscionable course of action that was a producing cause of\r\ndamages to the plaintiffs.<sup>(4)</sup>  Violation of a consumer's trust by a\r\nprofessional in the course of business is a DTPA violation.<sup>(5)</sup>  <em>See Latham\r\nv. Castillo</em>, 972 S.W.2d 66, 69 (Tex. 1988).  The evidence described\r\nabove shows more than a scintilla of evidence that appellees trusted\r\nSCI to provide a professional service, and that SCI violated that trust. <em>\r\nSee Formosa Plastics</em>, 960 S.W.2d at 48.  The jury finding is supported\r\nby the record, and not against the great weight and preponderance of\r\nthe evidence.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>. </em> We overrule SCI's fifth\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its sixth issue, SCI argues that there is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's judgment that it committed\r\nfraud against appellees.  The elements of common-law fraud are that (1)\r\na material representation was made; (2) the representation was false;\r\n(3) when the representation was made the speaker knew it was false\r\nor made it recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a\r\npositive assertion; (4) the representation was made with the intention\r\nthat it be acted upon by the other party; (5) the party acted in reliance\r\nupon the representation; and (6) the party suffered injury.  <em>Johnson &amp;\r\nHiggins of Texas, Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc.</em>, 692 S.W.2d 507, 524\r\n(Tex. 1998).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe jury received testimony from Angel that SCI had no intention\r\nof burying Jose Angel in close proximity to Marc's grave.  The jury also\r\nheard testimony from the cemetery's office manager that the\r\nsaleswoman who sold the separate plots for the same burial, first to the\r\nGalvans, then to their daughter-in-law, stood to earn a commission\r\nfrom each sale.  The jury could have believed that when SCI reinterred\r\nJose Angel in a plot close to the Galvans' other, partially-paid plots, that\r\nSCI recklessly represented that it could bury him there without any\r\nknowledge of the truth, while making positive assertions that their son\r\nwas buried in an unencumbered space in the cemetery.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe record contains more than a scintilla of evidence that SCI\r\ncommitted fraud. <em> See Formosa Plastics</em>, 960 S.W.2d at 48.  The jury\r\nfinding of fraud is not against the great weight and preponderance of\r\nthe evidence.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>. </em> We overrule SCI's sixth\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its seventh issue, SCI argues that the testimony of Dr. William\r\nValverde should have been admitted with a limiting instruction.  Dr.\r\nValverde testified about mental anguish damages.  \"A successful\r\nchallenge to evidentiary rulings usually requires the complaining party\r\nto show that the judgment turns on the particular evidence excluded or\r\nadmitted.\"  <em>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex.\r\n1995).  The jury instruction did not segregate particular theories of\r\nrecovery, and there was no objection to this non-segregation of theories\r\nat trial.  Since the jury instruction did not segregate particular theories\r\nof recovery, the judgment does not turn on this particular evidence, and\r\ntherefore there would be no point in limiting this testimony.  We\r\noverrule appellant's seventh point of error.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn it eighth, ninth and tenth issues, SCI argues that there was no\r\nevidence, or in the alternative, legally and factually insufficient evidence,\r\nof mental anguish suffered by the Galvans, and that the jury erred by\r\nawarding any damages to Angelita Benavides.  Proof of mental anguish\r\ndamages requires direct evidence of the nature, duration or severity of\r\none's anguish resulting in a substantial disruption in the plaintiff's daily\r\nroutine.  <em>Parkway Co. v. Woodruff</em>, 901 S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995). \r\nIn order to recover for mental anguish, a party must establish more than\r\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment or anger.  <em>Id</em>.  Courts are to\r\nclosely scrutinize awards of mental anguish damages.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe evidence of Angel Galvan's mental anguish heard by the jury\r\nincluded the testimony of a psychiatrist, his daughters Maria and\r\nAngelita, his wife, and Angel Galvan himself.  The jury also heard\r\nevidence of Mrs. Galvan's mental anguish, including testimony of a\r\npsychiatrist, the testimony of her daughter Maria, and her own\r\ntestimony. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe have closely reviewed the evidence described above and\r\ndetermined that there is more than a scintilla of evidence that the\r\nGalvans suffered mental anguish and that SCI failed to exercise\r\nreasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating\r\ninformation when selling the cemetery plot to Benavides. <em> See\r\nBrowning-Ferris</em>, 865 S.W.2d at 928.  The jury finding that the Galvans\r\nsuffered mental anguish and that SCI failed to exercise reasonable care\r\nor competence in obtaining or communicating information when selling\r\nthe cemetery plot to Benavides is not against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>. </em> \r\n\r\n</p><p>\t SCI argues that the jury erred by awarding any damages to\r\nAngelita Benavides because there is no evidence, or insufficient\r\nevidence of a gross disparity in consideration paid and the value\r\nreceived by Ms. Benavides.  The jury question did not require the jury\r\nto find a \"gross disparity,\" and SCI has directed this court to no law\r\nthat requires a \"gross disparity\" between consideration paid and value\r\nreceived in order to be awarded damages.  SCI sold Benavides property\r\nwhich it did not own.  The jury heard her testimony that she justifiably\r\nrelied upon SCI's false claims of ownership and suffered a pecuniary\r\nloss as a result of this reliance.  <em>See Appling</em>, 991 S.W.2d at 791 (Tex.\r\n1999).

Judgment in this case was signed on April 23,\r\n1999.  SCI's motion for new trial was denied on July 1, 1999.  Fourteen\r\ndays later, on July 15, 1999, appellees filed a motion for judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict.  This motion was granted on August 2,\r\n1999, 32 days after appellant's motion for new trial was denied.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tA motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be filed\r\nafter a judgment has been entered but before it becomes final. \r\n<em>Needsville Indep.

(\"SCI\") made negligent representations to\r\nappellees Angel S. Galvan, Maria Guadalupe Galvan and Angelita S.\r\nBenavides about the availability of cemetery plots for sale, and that SCI\r\nmade a fraudulent representation to Angel S. Galvan and Maria\r\nGuadalupe Galvan about the location of their son's burial plot.  SCI\r\nraises eleven points of error.  We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBecause appellants attack the legal and factual sufficiency of the\r\nevidence, and the facts to this case are somewhat complicated, we will\r\naddress the facts in some detail.  In 1989, Angel S. Galvan and Maria\r\nGuadalupe Galvan (\"the Galvans\") purchased two cemetery plots from\r\nSCI.  In 1994, their grandson Marc died and was buried in one of these\r\ntwo plots.  After Marc was buried, SCI offered to sell Angelita S.\r\nBenavides (\"Benavides\"), mother of Marc and daughter of the Galvans,\r\nseven additional plots close to where Marc was buried.  Benavides\r\ncontracted for three of the plots, her sister Maria Anita Reyna\r\ncontracted for two plots, and the Galvans contracted for two plots. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAccording to SCI's records, when SCI contracted to sell these\r\nseven plots, each plot was already owned by Noelia DeLeon.<sup>(2)</sup> \r\nBenavides and her sister both lost their plots when each was unable to\r\nmaintain regular payments on the plots.  On September 19, 1997,\r\nBenavides again purchased two of the three plots that, according to\r\nSCI's records and DeLeon, were already sold to DeLeon.  Again,\r\nBenavides was unable to maintain consistent payments and lost\r\nownership rights to the cemetery plots.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn 1995, Benavides purchased a separate plot, next to her son\r\nMarc's grave, but lost it because she could not pay for it.  In February\r\n1997, Benavides again purchased this plot. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOn September 2, 1997 Jose Angel Galvan, the Galvans' son, and\r\nBenavides's brother, died.  According to the testimony at trial, Yolanda\r\nGalvan, Jose Angel Galvan's widow, sent her father-in-law, appellee\r\nAngel Galvan, as her agent to handle the arrangements with SCI.  Angel\r\nGalvan testified that an SCI employee told him that his plots (which\r\nwere actually owned by DeLeon) were a few feet away from his\r\ngrandson Marc.  Based on this information, Angel Galvan instructed SCI\r\nto bury Jose Angel Galvan in one of his plots.  In order to do this, SCI\r\nrequired that the Galvans transfer their ownership rights in another plot\r\nbecause SCI requires that payment be made in full before interment,\r\nand the Galvans had not completed payments on the plot where Jose\r\nAngel was to be buried.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAccording to the testimony of Yolanda Galvan, that same day the\r\nsame SCI sales representative asked Yolanda where she wanted Jose\r\nAngel Galvan buried.  Yolanda had allowed Angel to make all of the\r\narrangements, but then, because she wanted her husband to be buried\r\nwhere she could later be buried next to him, allowed the SCI sales\r\nrepresentative to sell her another plot.  Angel testified that he was not\r\npresent at this time, having left to buy a suit for his son to be buried in.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSoon thereafter, the Galvans signed a quit-claim deed to transfer\r\nownership of the plot where Jose Angel was going to be buried to\r\nYolanda .  SCI provided the deed for their signature after having made\r\ndifferent representations to the Galvans and Yolanda as to where Jose\r\nAngel  would be buried.  The Galvans did not know that their son was\r\ngoing to be buried in a different location than had been represented to\r\nthem before they signed the deed.  The deed showed that the cemetery\r\nplot was actually much further from Marc than the Galvans understood\r\nit to be.  The Galvans first realized this when they arrived at the\r\ncemetery for the burial.  Jose Angel was buried in the spot farther away\r\nfrom Marc, but, after being informed of this misunderstanding, SCI\r\nagreed to reinter Jose Angel next to Marc.  Only after Jose Angel was\r\nreinterred, did SCI notify anyone that the plot was actually owned by\r\nDeLeon.  Jose Angel was then buried a third time.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its first issue, SCI argues that the trial court did not have\r\njurisdiction to hear this case without Yolanda as an indispensable party\r\nto the suit, because, as Jose Angel's surviving spouse, only she can\r\nbring a claim for the wrongful burial, disinterment or exhumation of\r\nJose Angel's body.  <em>See </em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§ \r\n711.002(a),(d), 711.004(a),(b) (Vernon Supp. 2001).  SCI raises this\r\nissue for the first time on appeal.  SCI did not plead that the decedent's\r\nwife was a necessary party as required by the rules of civil procedure. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 39. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tPrior to the amendment of rule 39 in 1971, a failure to include an\r\nindispensable party was fundamental error which could be raised to\r\nattack the court's jurisdiction on appeal.  <em>See e.g.</em>, <em>Petroleum Anchor\r\nEquip., Inc. v. Tyra</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></span>, 893 (Tex. 1965);<em> Sharpe v.\r\nLandowners Oil Ass'n</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3901802\"><a href=\"/opinion/4138937/sharpe-v-landowners-oil-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 436 (Tex. 1936).  The\r\namendment to rule 39 in 1971 rendered inoperative most of the\r\npotential for fundamental error due to failure to include an indispensable\r\nparty.  <em>McBurnett v.

If the trial court had the opportunity to rule on the\r\njoinder of decedent's spouse, it could have determined \"whether in\r\nequity and good conscience the action should proceed among the\r\nparties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person [decedent's\r\nspouse] being thus regarded as indispensable.\"  Tex. R. Civ. P. 39(b).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOne of the practical factors an appellate court can take into\r\nconsideration in holding that an absent party was not jurisdictionally\r\nindispensable is whether or not the case \"had actually been tried as to\r\nthose parties who were present and <em>there was no objection at the trial\r\nlevel concerning the nonjoinder of a party</em>. . . . [A]t the appellate stage\r\nthere is reason not to throw away a judgment just because it did not\r\ntheoretically settle the whole controversy.\"  <em>Cooper</em>, 513 S.W.2d at 204\r\n(emphasis added).  Since SCI did not object at the trial level to the\r\nnonjoinder of Yolanda Galvan, it has waived the issue of joinder of the\r\ndecedent's wife.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe absence of the decedent's wife did not deprive the trial court\r\nof jurisdiction between the parties before it.  The Galvans do not argue\r\nthat SCI made negligent representations and committed fraud towards\r\ndecedent's wife; therefore she is not a necessary party to that part of\r\nthe suit.  In regard to the other issues, the trial court resolved the\r\ndispute between the parties before it even if \"it did not theoretically\r\nsettle the whole controversy.\"  <em>Cooper</em>, 513 S.W.2d at 204.  We\r\noverrule SCI's first issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAs part of its second, fourth, fifth and sixth issues, SCI argues that\r\nthe trial court erred by allowing the submission of a single damage\r\nquestion for each plaintiff for multiple theories of recovery.  The jury\r\nwas charged as SCI requested it to be charged.  The charge did not\r\ninclude the submission of a single damage question for each plaintiff for\r\nmultiple theories of recovery.  SCI did not object to the charge.  Error in\r\nthe charge must be preserved by distinctly designating the error and the\r\ngrounds for objection.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 274; <em>Cosgrove v.

Any possible\r\nerror in the organization of the damages question submitted by SCI is\r\ntherefore not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its second issue, SCI claims that it owed no duty with respect\r\nto the location of the decedent's interment or his disinterment and that\r\nthe evidence is both legally and factually insufficient to support the\r\njury's finding that SCI was negligent with respect to the location of the\r\ndecedent's interment or his disinterment.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWhen reviewing challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence,\r\nwe consider all the evidence and inferences in the record in a light most\r\nfavorable to the party in whose favor the verdict has been rendered and\r\nindulge every reasonable inference in that party's favor.   <em>See Formosa\r\nPlastics Corp.

Appellees' choice not to accept the\r\nsettlement offer neither negates their contractual obligation to make\r\npayments on the plots nor makes the compromise offer rebuttal to\r\ncounsel's comment that SCI continued to accept such payments.  We\r\nsee no abuse of discretion, and overrule SCI's third issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its fourth issue, SCI argues that there was no evidence, or in the\r\nalternative, legally and factually insufficient evidence of any DTPA\r\nviolations.  The jury found that SCI had violated sections 17.46(b)(5),(7)\r\nand (12) of the DTPA.<sup>(3)</sup>  There was evidence presented to the jury that\r\nSCI made affirmative representations that it would bury Jose Angel at\r\na location and that it then did not do so.  SCI made affirmative\r\nrepresentations that it could reinter Jose Angel at a location where it\r\ncould not because they did not own the location.  SCI made affirmative\r\nrepresentations orally and by written agreement that it could convey\r\ntitle to plots which it did not own.  <em>See Smith v.

App.--Corpus Christi 1995) (finding of DTPA\r\nviolations where real estate agency made oral and written affirmative\r\nrepresentation of ability to convey clear title, when unknown to the\r\nagency, it could not).  The evidence supporting the jury's finding is\r\nmore than the scintilla of evidence required by law.  <em>See Formosa\r\nPlastics</em>, 960 S.W.2d at 48.  The jury's finding is not against the great\r\nweight and preponderance of the evidence; nor is it clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>.  </em>We overrule SCI's fourth issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its fifth issue, SCI argues that the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the jury's finding that SCI engaged in an\r\nunconscionable course of action that was a producing cause of\r\ndamages to the plaintiffs.<sup>(4)</sup>  Violation of a consumer's trust by a\r\nprofessional in the course of business is a DTPA violation.<sup>(5)</sup>  <em>See Latham\r\nv. Castillo</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span>, 69 (Tex. 1988).  The evidence described\r\nabove shows more than a scintilla of evidence that appellees trusted\r\nSCI to provide a professional service, and that SCI violated that trust. <em>\r\nSee Formosa Plastics</em>, 960 S.W.2d at 48.  The jury finding is supported\r\nby the record, and not against the great weight and preponderance of\r\nthe evidence.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>. </em> We overrule SCI's fifth\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its sixth issue, SCI argues that there is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's judgment that it committed\r\nfraud against appellees.  The elements of common-law fraud are that (1)\r\na material representation was made; (2) the representation was false;\r\n(3) when the representation was made the speaker knew it was false\r\nor made it recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a\r\npositive assertion; (4) the representation was made with the intention\r\nthat it be acted upon by the other party; (5) the party acted in reliance\r\nupon the representation; and (6) the party suffered injury.  <em>Johnson &amp;\r\nHiggins of Texas, Inc. v.

The jury also\r\nheard testimony from the cemetery's office manager that the\r\nsaleswoman who sold the separate plots for the same burial, first to the\r\nGalvans, then to their daughter-in-law, stood to earn a commission\r\nfrom each sale.  The jury could have believed that when SCI reinterred\r\nJose Angel in a plot close to the Galvans' other, partially-paid plots, that\r\nSCI recklessly represented that it could bury him there without any\r\nknowledge of the truth, while making positive assertions that their son\r\nwas buried in an unencumbered space in the cemetery.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe record contains more than a scintilla of evidence that SCI\r\ncommitted fraud. <em> See Formosa Plastics</em>, 960 S.W.2d at 48.  The jury\r\nfinding of fraud is not against the great weight and preponderance of\r\nthe evidence.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>. </em> We overrule SCI's sixth\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its seventh issue, SCI argues that the testimony of Dr. William\r\nValverde should have been admitted with a limiting instruction.  Dr.\r\nValverde testified about mental anguish damages.  \"A successful\r\nchallenge to evidentiary rulings usually requires the complaining party\r\nto show that the judgment turns on the particular evidence excluded or\r\nadmitted.\"  <em>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435512/city-of-brownsville-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 753 (Tex.\r\n1995).  The jury instruction did not segregate particular theories of\r\nrecovery, and there was no objection to this non-segregation of theories\r\nat trial.  Since the jury instruction did not segregate particular theories\r\nof recovery, the judgment does not turn on this particular evidence, and\r\ntherefore there would be no point in limiting this testimony.  We\r\noverrule appellant's seventh point of error.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn it eighth, ninth and tenth issues, SCI argues that there was no\r\nevidence, or in the alternative, legally and factually insufficient evidence,\r\nof mental anguish suffered by the Galvans, and that the jury erred by\r\nawarding any damages to Angelita Benavides.  Proof of mental anguish\r\ndamages requires direct evidence of the nature, duration or severity of\r\none's anguish resulting in a substantial disruption in the plaintiff's daily\r\nroutine.  <em>Parkway Co. v. Woodruff</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454480/parkway-co-v-woodruff/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 444 (Tex. 1995). \r\nIn order to recover for mental anguish, a party must establish more than\r\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment or anger.  <em>Id</em>.  Courts are to\r\nclosely scrutinize awards of mental anguish damages.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe evidence of Angel Galvan's mental anguish heard by the jury\r\nincluded the testimony of a psychiatrist, his daughters Maria and\r\nAngelita, his wife, and Angel Galvan himself.  The jury also heard\r\nevidence of Mrs. Galvan's mental anguish, including testimony of a\r\npsychiatrist, the testimony of her daughter Maria, and her own\r\ntestimony. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe have closely reviewed the evidence described above and\r\ndetermined that there is more than a scintilla of evidence that the\r\nGalvans suffered mental anguish and that SCI failed to exercise\r\nreasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating\r\ninformation when selling the cemetery plot to Benavides. <em> See\r\nBrowning-Ferris</em>, 865 S.W.2d at 928.  The jury finding that the Galvans\r\nsuffered mental anguish and that SCI failed to exercise reasonable care\r\nor competence in obtaining or communicating information when selling\r\nthe cemetery plot to Benavides is not against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence.  <em>See Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772<em>. </em> \r\n\r\n</p><p>\t SCI argues that the jury erred by awarding any damages to\r\nAngelita Benavides because there is no evidence, or insufficient\r\nevidence of a gross disparity in consideration paid and the value\r\nreceived by Ms. Benavides.  The jury question did not require the jury\r\nto find a \"gross disparity,\" and SCI has directed this court to no law\r\nthat requires a \"gross disparity\" between consideration paid and value\r\nreceived in order to be awarded damages.  SCI sold Benavides property\r\nwhich it did not own.  The jury heard her testimony that she justifiably\r\nrelied upon SCI's false claims of ownership and suffered a pecuniary\r\nloss as a result of this reliance.  <em>See Appling</em>, 991 S.W.2d at 791 (Tex.\r\n1999).  We overrule SCI's eighth, ninth and tenth issues.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn its eleventh issue, SCI argues that the trial court erred by\r\ngranting appellees' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\nawarding attorneys fees in the event of appeal because the trial court's\r\njurisdiction had expired.  Judgment in this case was signed on April 23,\r\n1999.  SCI's motion for new trial was denied on July 1, 1999.  Fourteen\r\ndays later, on July 15, 1999, appellees filed a motion for judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict.  This motion was granted on August 2,\r\n1999, 32 days after appellant's motion for new trial was denied.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tA motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be filed\r\nafter a judgment has been entered but before it becomes final. \r\n<em>Needsville Indep.

App.--Beaumont 1978, no writ).  The trial court retained\r\njurisdiction over this case until thirty days after SCI's motion for new\r\ntrial was overruled.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(e).  At this time the judgment\r\nbecame final.  <em>Id</em>.  Here, the thirtieth day  fell on a weekend, and the\r\norder granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict was signed the\r\nfollowing Monday.  When the last day of a court's plenary period falls\r\non a weekend the period runs until the end of the next day which is not\r\na Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 4.  The court\r\ntherefore had the power to rule on the motion.  <em>See</em> <em>McClelland v.\r\nPartida</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2442979\"><a href=\"/opinion/2442979/mcclelland-v-partida/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 455 n.2 (Tex.
