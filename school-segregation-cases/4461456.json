The only remaining issues are how to divide the\n                   settlement proceeds between Plaintiffs, Intervenor, James Johns\n                   and Intervenor, Vicki Johns. In addition, Plaintiffs are\n                   challenging Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ common law marriage to\n                   the deceased, Brian Johns.\n\n\n\nTrial Court:       The Honorable Loyd Wright, Judge Presiding, the Probate Court\n                   Number One (1) of Harris County, Texas.\n\nDisposition:       Intervenor, Vicki Johns, filed a Motion to Compel discovery\n                   responses against Plaintiffs based on Plaintiffs failure to provide\n                   adequate responses to Intervenor’s Interrogatories and Requests\n                   for Production. The trial court denied the motion, in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                        viii\n\f                         STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      This Court has jurisdiction over this mandamus action by virtue of Tex. Govt.\n\nCode Sec. 22.221(a) and (b)(1) which allows a party to apply for a Writ of\n\nMandamus against a judge of a district or county court in the court of appeals\n\ndistrict, when the trial court abuses its discretion. Relators must show the trial court\n\nabused its discretion and that Relators are without an adequate appellate remedy.

Relator contends that Respondent’s order denying,\n\nin part, Relator’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses against Plaintiffs in the\n\ntrial court, Frances Sowell and Corey Johns is an abuse of discretion violating Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 193.2(e), 196.2, 197.2(a) (which provides the applicable deadline for a\n\nparty to file its written response to requests for production and responses to request\n\nfor interrogatories). Relator has no adequate appellate remedy. Relator seeks a writ\n\nof mandamus compelling Respondent to order the objections of Plaintiffs to be\n\nwithdrawn and ordering responses to Relator’s Requests for Productions,\n\nInterrogatories and Second Request for Production.\n\n      On January 28, 2015, Relator, Vicki Johns, propounded the following\n\ndiscovery requests: (1) Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ First Request for Production to\n\nPlaintiff Frances Sowell and Corey Johns, (2) Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ First Set of\n\nInterrogatories to Plaintiff Corey Johns, Individually and as Heir of Brain Edward\n\nJohns, Deceased, and (3) Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ First Set of Interrogatories to\n\nPlaintiff Frances Sowell, Individually and as Heir of Brian Edward Johns, Deceased,\n\nand as Administrator for the Estate of Brain Edward Johns, Deceased. [Tab4]\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fSpecifically, Relator requested an authorization to obtain educational records for\n\nCorey Johns:\n\n      No. 13: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain educational records for\n      Corey Johns attached hereto as Exhibit “B.”\n      [Tab5]\n\n       Relator has requested the authorization in order to obtain the administrative\n\nfile which contains a letter written by Relator to the administration on Corey Johns’\n\nbehalf during the administrative proceeding at Southern University. This letter\n\nwhich was written by Relator includes facts which support her common law\n\nmarriage to Corey Johns’ father, Brian Johns.\n\n      Additionally, Relator requested an authorization to obtain the employment\n\nrecords of Frances Sowell:\n\n      No. 20: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain employment records for\n      Frances Sowell attached hereto as Exhibit “D.”\n      [Tab5]\n\n      Relator has requested records in order to establish that France Sowell, the\n\nadministrator of Brian Johns’ estate, has a strong relationship at the hospital where\n\nBrian was taken after the incident. France Sowell’s relationship with the hospital\n\ngave her the power and ability to exclude Relator from seeing her husband while he\n\nwas on his deathbed. [Tab2, (Transcript P15,L11-12)]\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      Plaintiffs served their responses and objections on June 5, 2015, over four\n\nmonths after the due date. [Tab5; Tab6] The Plaintiffs’ responses included numerous\n\nobjections to Intervenor Vicki Johns’ Requests for Production and Interrogatories.\n\n[Tab5; Tab6]\n\n      Additionally, Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ Second Requests for Production to\n\nPlaintiffs Francis Sowell and Corey Johns were propounded on March 27, 2015. The\n\nresponses were due on April 27, 2015. [Tab7] Plaintiffs responded to the requests\n\non June 11, 2015, over a month and a half late. [Tab8] Again, Plaintiffs objected to\n\nthe requests for production and did not provide any answers or responsive\n\ndocuments.\n\n      On June 16, 2015, Relator filed a Motion to Compel Discovery responses from\n\nPlaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns. The answers to said Interrogatories and\n\nRequests for Production are necessary for Relator to properly prepare her case for\n\ntrial as well as counter attacks on her marriage which have already been made by\n\nPlaintiffs. Given Plaintiffs have already contested Relator’s common law spouse\n\nstatus in a multitude of ways, Relator needs the information sought to support her\n\ncommon law marriage.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Respondent’s ’s Order Denying Relator’s Motion to Compel Discovery\n\nResponse pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 215.1 (b) was an abuse of discretion by\n\nignoring the Plaintiff’s failure to timely and adequately respond to Intervenor’s\n\nInterrogatories and Intervenor’s Request for Production. Relator has no adequate\n\nappellate remedy.\n\n                                       ARGUMENT\n\n      A. Plaintiffs have waived their objections to Relator’s discovery requests\n      when Plaintiffs failed to timely assert their objections. Therefore, the\n      court should compel production.\n      Mandamus will issue to correct a clear abuse of discretion or a violation of a\n\nduty imposed by law when there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential\n\nIns. Co., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). This Court determines the adequacy\n\nof an appellate remedy by balancing the benefits of mandamus review against its\n\ndetriments. Id. at 136. In evaluating benefits and detriments, this Court considers\n\nwhether mandamus will preserve important substantive and procedural rights from\n\nimpairment or loss. Id. A trial court abuses its discretion if it reaches a decision so\n\narbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law, or if\n\nit clearly fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt.,\n\nL.P., 164 S.W.3d 379, 382 (Tex. 2005).\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      Plaintiffs, Frances Sowell and Corey Johns, were served with Relator’s First\n\nSet of Interrogatories and Requests for Production on January 28, 2015. Pursuant to\n\nthe Texas Rules of Civil Procedure the party responding to discovery has 30 days\n\nfrom the time of service to respond to written discovery. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.2; Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 197.2. As such, Plaintiff’s deadline to respond to Relator’s Request for\n\nProduction and Interrogatories would have been March 2, 2015. Plaintiffs failed to\n\ntimely serve their objections and responses, ultimately serving their responses and\n\nobjections on June 5, 2015. Plaintiffs were three months late in serving their\n\nobjections and responses. [Tab5; Tab6] Once Plaintiffs finally responded, their\n\nresponses included numerous objections to Relator, Vicki Johns’, Requests for\n\nProduction and Interrogatories. [Tab5; Tab6]\n\n      Relator then served a Second Request for Production on Plaintiffs on March\n\n27, 2015. [Tab7] Plaintiffs’ responses to Relator’s Second Request for Production\n\nwere due on April 27, 2015. [Tab7] Plaintiffs did not respond to Relator’s Second\n\nRequest for Production until June 11, 2015, over a month and a half late. Even\n\nthough Plaintiffs ultimately responded, Plaintiffs only served objections with no\n\nresponsive documents to Relator’s requests. [Tab8]\n\n      As a party resisting discovery the Plaintiffs had an obligation to object to the\n\nwritten discovery at or before the deadline to respond to discovery. Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n197.2; Remington Arms Co. v. Canales, 837 S.W.2d 624, 625 (Tex.1992). Since\n                                          5\n\fPlaintiffs did not timely serve their objections to Relator’s Requests for Production\n\nand Interrogatories they waived their objections. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2(e). The only\n\ntime an objection is not waived is when the responding party (1) obtained an\n\nextension of time by agreement or by court order or (2) can show good cause for not\n\ntimely objection. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2(e); Remington Arms, 837 S.W.2d at 625;\n\nHobson v. Moore, 734 S.W.2d 341 (Tex.1987).\n\n      During and over a four month period (January 28, 2015 to June 5, 2015)\n\nPlaintiffs failed to request an agreed extended deadline to respond to written\n\ndiscovery from Relator. Additionally, Plaintiffs never attempted to file a motion with\n\nthe court requesting a modification of the discovery procedures. Furthermore,\n\nPlaintiffs failed to show good cause for failing to timely object to Relator’s written\n\ndiscovery. In order for a party to be excused from failure to timely respond, there\n\nmust be a strict showing of good cause. Alvarado v. Farah Mfg., 830 S.W.2d 911,\n\n914 (Tex. 1992)(emphasis added).\n\n      Upon hearing of Relator’s Motion to Compel Discovery responses from\n\nPlaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that Corey\n\nJohns’ educational records were exempt from production as protected by FERPA.\n\n[Tab2, (Transcript P18,L9-11)] However, production of Corey Johns’ educational\n\nrecords would not be in violation of FERPA as the release of such information is\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fpermitted if in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.1\n\nFurthermore, Corey Johns is a party to the current litigation, as such, can sign an\n\nauthorization releasing records typically protected by FERPA.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ counsel also attempted to argue that Plaintiffs were served with\n\nwritten discovery during a time period that Plaintiffs’ Plea to the Jurisdiction and\n\nMotion for Summary Judgement were pending. [Tab2, (Transcript P20,L8-11)] As\n\nsuch, Plaintiffs wrongfully assumed that pending a ruling on the above mentioned\n\nmotions that they were excused from responding or even objecting to the discovery\n\nserved on them. [Tab2, (Transcript P21,L11-13)] In National Hockey League the\n\ncourt held that counsel’s willful, intentional and callous disregard for responsibilities\n\nowed to the Court and to their opponent would certainly not demonstrate good cause.\n\nNat'l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639 (1976).\n\nAdditionally, the court held that if the imposition of such severe sanctions were not\n\nwarranted by such flagrant bad faith, then there could be no set of facts whereby\n\nsevere sanctions would ever apply. Id.\n\n       The good cause exception permits a trial court to excuse a failure to comply\n\nwith discovery in difficult or impossible circumstances. Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774\n\n\n\n1\n  FERPA allows the disclosure of otherwise protected student educational records or\ninformation, pursuant to a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. 34 CFR 99.31(a)(9)(ii)(A)-\n(B).\n                                                7\n\fS.W.2d 647 (Tex. 1989) (inability to locate a witness despite good faith efforts or\n\ninability to anticipate use of witness’ testimony at trial might support a finding of\n\ngood cause). Unlike Clark, Plaintiffs in the current case unilaterally decided to not\n\ncomply with the deadline to respond or object, in flagrant bad faith and with callous\n\ndisregard for the responsibilities of discovery under the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. [Tab2, (Transcript P21,L4-10)]\n\n      A trial court has discretion to determine whether the party in violation has met\n\nthe burden of showing good cause, however, the trial court has no discretion to rule\n\nin favor of the party in violation without showing of good cause. Alvarado, 830\n\nS.W.2d at 914. Plaintiffs failed to present any evidence of difficult or impossible\n\ncircumstances that would prevent them from timely responding or objecting to\n\nRelator’s written discovery. If a party resisting discovery fails to present evidence\n\nto support an objection or a claim or privilege, that party waives any complaint. In\n\nre Texas Farmers Insurance Exchange, 990 S.W.2d 337 (Tex. App. Texarkana\n\n1999, original proceeding); Independent Insulating Glass Southwest, Inc. v. Street,\n\n722 S.W.2d 798, 802 (Tex. App. - Fort Worth 1987, writ dism'd). See also, Tex.\n\nR.Civ.P. 193.4 (a)\n\n      Pursuant to the rules of procedure a party may present evidence to support an\n\nobjection in the form of testimony presented at the hearing, or a response to the\n\nmotion and/or affidavits served at least seven days before the hearing. Tex. R. Civ.\n                                          8\n\fP. 193.4. Despite this opportunity to present their arguments, Plaintiffs failed to\n\nsubmit a response to Relator’s Motion to Compel. Furthermore, Plaintiffs failed to\n\nsubmit affidavits or offer their own testimony in support of their opposition to\n\nRelator’s Motion to Compel.\n\n      Instead, Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged the deadline to respond and created\n\nan inapplicable exception in disregarding the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court judge should have found that Plaintiffs were in direct\n\nviolation of discovery procedures, which waived their right to object to written\n\ndiscovery, furthermore, compelling Plaintiffs to fully respond. Given Plaintiffs\n\ncomplete disregard for the rules, the trial court could reasonably have reached only\n\none decision, granting Relator’s Motion to Compel.\n\n      As such, Respondent’s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, and an abused\n\nhis discretion in denying Relator’s Motion to Compel discovery responses from\n\nPlaintiffs, Frances Sowell and Corey Johns.\n\n      B. Relator has no adequate remedy on appeal as the case would proceed\n         to trial without allowing Relator a sufficient opportunity for discovery\n         of evidence which goes to the heart of her claim.\n\n      Relator does not have an adequate appellate remedy as to the common law\n\ncause of action, which is set for trial beginning November 2, 2015. There are facts\n\nand circumstances supporting a grant of Relators Motion to Compel Discovery\n\nresponses from Plaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns. The legal rights of\n                                         9\n\fRelator will be prejudiced by a further denial of Relator’s Motion to Compel, to a\n\ndegree that, there is an abuse of discretion. A denial of discovery going to the heart\n\nof a party’s case may render the appellate remedy inadequate. Walker v. Packer, 827\n\nS.W.2d 833, 843(Tex. 1992). Relator has been denied the opportunity to obtain\n\nevidence, including but not limited to Plaintiff, Corey Johns’ educational records,\n\nPlaintiff, Frances, Sowell’s employment records, and correspondence between Brian\n\nJohn’s family members during his marriage with Relator, which would result in the\n\nexclusion of evidence that goes to the heart of Relator’s cause of action as common\n\nlaw wife of decedent.\n\n      The answers to said Interrogatories and Requests for Production are necessary\n\nfor Relator to properly prepare her case for trial as well as counter attacks on her\n\nmarriage, which have already been made by Plaintiffs. Given Plaintiffs have already\n\ncontested Relator’s common law spouse status in a multitude of ways, Relator needs\n\nthe information sought to support her common law marriage.\n\nRequests for Production\n\n      Plaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns have waived their objections to all\n\nrequests for production and have refused to answer the following Requests for\n\nProduction:\n\n      No. 9: Any and all copies of investigation documentation, reports and/or\n      memoranda made by or submitted to Plaintiff, as a result of the incident which\n\n                                         10\n\fhas been made the basis of Intervener’s lawsuit.\n\n\nNo. 10: Copies of any and all books, documents or other tangible things which\nmay or may not be introduced at trial, but which may have a bearing on\nIntervener’s cause of action and may be used as demonstrative evidence at\ntrial.\n\nNo. 13: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain educational records for\nCorey Johns attached hereto as Exhibit “B.”\n\nNo. 17: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain cellular phone records for\nPlaintiffs attached hereto as Exhibit “C.”\n\nNo. 20: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain employment records for\nFrances Sowell attached hereto as Exhibit “D.”\n\nNo. 21: Copy of any and all documents showing that Vicki Johns was placed on\nnotice of any proceedings naming Frances Sowell as the administrator of Brian\nJohns’ estate.\n\n\nNo. 22: Any and all written correspondence between Corey Johns and Brian\nJohns before the incident which forms the basis of this lawsuit.\n\nNo. 23: Any and all written correspondence between Frances Sowell and Brian\nJohns before the incident which forms the basis of this lawsuit.\n\nNo. 24: Any and all written correspondence between Corey Johns and Pam\nRoberson after the incident which forms the basis of this lawsuit.\n\nNo. 25: Any and all written correspondence between Frances Sowell and Pam\nRoberson after the incident which forms the basis of this lawsuit.\n\nNo. 26: Any and all written correspondence between Plaintiffs and Vicki\nJohns before and after the incident which forms the basis of this lawsuit.\n\n[Tab4]\n\n                                   11\n\f      No. 1: A copy of the cell phone records for Corey Johns from January 1, 2012\n      to January 1, 2013.\n      No. 2: A copy of the cell phone records for Brian Johns from January 1, 2012 to\n      January 1, 2013\n\n      No. 3: A copy of the cell phone records for Frances Sowell from January 1, 2012\n      to January 1, 2013.\n\n      [Tab8]\n\nInterrogatories\n\n\n      Additionally, Plaintiff Frances Sowell has waived her objections to all\n\nInterrogatories and has refused to answer the following Interrogatories:\n\n      No. 1: Identify each person either participating in the preparation of the answers\n      to these interrogations or supplying information used in such preparation, and\n      indicate the interrogatories with respect to which he or she was involved.\n\n\n      No. 4: Please state completely and fully all representations, statements,\n      declarations or admissions made by Intervener or any agent, servant or\n      employee of Intervener.

Jampole v. Touchy,\n\n673 S.W.2d 569 (Tex.1984). The court held that relator in the Jampole case did not\n\nhave an adequate appellate remedy because denial of this discovery would have\n\neffectively prevented relator from proving the material allegations of his claim. Id.\n\nat 576. Additionally, the court expressed that a remedy by appeal in a discovery\n\nmandamus is not adequate when a party is required to “try his lawsuit, debilitated by\n\nthe denial of proper discovery, only to have the lawsuit rendered a certain nullity on\n\nappeal…” Id. Similarly, if Relator in the present case is denied mandamus relief she\n\nwould be prevented from discovery of evidence which would assist in developing\n\n\n                                         14\n\fthe merits of her common law marriage to Brian Johns. Specifically, Relator would\n\nbe prevented from attaining documents from Plaintiff Corey John’s educational\n\nrecords, including the letter she wrote on behalf of Corey Johns stating that she was\n\nhis stepmother and that he would be living at her and Brian Johns’ home after his\n\narrest, around September/October of 2010 and during Relator’s common marriage\n\nwith Brian Johns. [Tab2, (Transcript P14,L12-20)]\n\n      Additionally, Relator would be prevented from establishing Plaintiff, Frances\n\nSowell’s relationship with the hospital and treating staff where Brian Johns was\n\ntaken after the explosion. After her initial visit to the hospital on July 17, 2012,\n\nRelator was prevented from seeing her dying husband as a result of Plaintiff, Frances\n\nSowell setting a password with hospital staff. Relator requested an authorization to\n\nobtain the employment Records of Frances, in order to establish that France Sowell,\n\nthe administrator of Brian Johns’ estate, has a strong relationship at the hospital.\n\nRelator intends to show that France Sowell’s relationship with the hospital gave her\n\nthe power and ability to exclude Relator from seeing her husband while he was on\n\nhis death bed.\n\n      Relator would be further deprived of establishing her common law marriage\n\nwith Brian Johns by denied access to correspondence between Brian Johns’ and his\n\nfamily and/or between his family members. Relator has testified to the resentment\n\nand hatred she received from Brian Johns’ family during their marriage and after\n                                         15\n\fBrian’s death. [Tab1, (Deposition P135,L7-25;P136,L1-3)] Plaintiffs’ previously\n\nproduced an e-mail sent by Relator to several members of Brian Johns’ family,\n\nincluding Plaintiff Frances Sowell, requesting that the family stay out of their\n\nrelationship and allow them to move on with their lives because they loved each\n\nother. [Tab9] This was the only email produced by Plaintiffs in respond to Relator’s\n\nrequest for production. Accordingly, Relator has reason to believe that there are\n\nvarious e-mails between Brian Johns’ family members that will evince that Relator\n\nand Brian Johns maintained a common law marriage after their formal divorce or\n\nthat they were not aware of a formal divorce. As such, this discovery goes to the\n\nheart of establishing the elements of Relator’s common law marriage claim, and\n\nfurther denying Relator’s discovery of such evidence would prejudice and hinder her\n\nability to support the merits of her claim. Additionally, Relator needs these\n\ncorrespondence and emails between Brian and his family in order to defend against\n\nCorey Johns, Frances Sowell and James Johns, Sr.’s wrongful death damages.\n\nApportionment of the wrongful death damages will be determined by the\n\nrelationship of each individual with decedent, Brian Edward Johns, further justifying\n\nRelator’s need for such correspondence. [Tab2, (Transcript P24,L5-13)]\n\n      Furthermore, Relator agreed at the hearing on Relator’s Motion to Compel to\n\nnarrow the time period for Request for Production No. 22-26 to narrow the request\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fto correspondence between 2007, the time Brian and Vicki were initially married,\n\nuntil 2012, the time of Brian Johns’ death. [Tab2, (Transcript P16,L11-16)]\n\n      Finally, remedy by appeal may be inadequate where the trial court disallows\n\ndiscovery and the missing discovery cannot be made part of the appellate record and\n\nthe reviewing court is unable to evaluate the effect of the trial court’s error on the\n\nrecord before it. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 842 (Tex. 1992). Should Relator\n\nbe denied mandamus relief, her common law marriage claim would proceed to trial\n\nwithout permitting Relator opportunity for discovery of evidence necessary to prove\n\nup her claim or to make part of the appellate record. Therefore, Relator would not\n\nhave an adequate remedy by appellate review should she be denied mandamus relief\n\non her Motion to Compel Discovery responses from Plaintiffs Frances Sowell and\n\nCorey Johns. Ultimately, the denial of a reasonable opportunity to develop the merits\n\nof Relator’s case would result in a trial that would be a waste of judicial resources.\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n      Respondent’s abuse of discretion resulted in the denial of Relator’s Motion to\n\nCompel. Not one document or answers to Interrogatories requested in Relator’s\n\nMotion to Compel was ordered to be produced or ordered to be answered by\n\nPlaintiffs, despite the fact that Plaintiffs obviously failed to object, respond or\n\nanswer in a timely manner. The denial of Relator’s Motion to Compel is so arbitrary\n\n\n                                          17\n\fand unreasonable as to constitute a clear abuse of discretion, for which there is no\n\nadequate remedy by appeal.\n\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n\n       For all the reasons set forth above, Relator, Vicki Johns, respectfully requests\n\nthat this petition for writ of mandamus be filed and set for hearing or submission,\n\nand that this Court grant Relator’s petition for writ of mandamus, directing the trial\n\ncourt to withdraw the Order denying Relator’s Motion to Compel and to issue an\n\nOrder Compelling Plaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns to adequately respond\n\nand produce all documents and answer all interrogatories responsive to Relator’s\n\nRequest for Production, Interrogatories and Second Request for Production. .

So we have a Motion to Compel\n\n21   Discovery Responses.\n\n22                  MR. WYNNE:    I figure it makes some sense that\n\n23   since the last time we have been here there has been some\n\n24   progress made and some of the issues have been narrowed down\n\n25   and the immediate thing we are here for is two motions, so if\n\f                                                                       4\n\n\n\n 1   you don't mind, I would like to give you a little bit of where\n\n 2   we are in the case.\n\n 3                    So, as you know, Brian Johns died as a result of\n\n 4   an industrial accident back in August of 2012 and that led to a\n\n 5   lawsuit against his employer and the other owners-operators of\n\n 6   the industrial facility down in Deer Park.   In addition to the\n\n 7   three parties that I represent, the Estate, Brian's mother and\n\n 8   brother's adult son, Brian's ex-wife filed a claim against the\n\n 9   Defendants and Brian's father filed a claim.     All the claimants\n\n10   have settled all the claims against the Defendants and we are\n\n11   just waiting to paper up some documents on that and so really\n\n12   the only issue -- live issue that's left for the Court or left\n\n13   for a jury trial or any resolution is the issue of the\n\n14   allocation of the settlement proceeds between the five\n\n15   beneficiaries and then, two, whether the ex-wife is, as she\n\n16   purports to be, the common-law marriage of Brian at the time of\n\n17   his death.   And that's really the two issues and what we have\n\n18   narrowed down.   And I expect sooner rather than later all that\n\n19   paperwork will be done and we will back in front of the Court\n\n20   to get an approval in the heirship proceeding.\n\n21                    As far as the two motions today, one of which\n\n22   applies to Ms. Bobbie Young, who is an attorney, what we have\n\n23   discovered through the course of this lawsuit is that the\n\n24   ex-wife at the time before -- maybe a year or so before Brian's\n\n25   death to about six or seven or eight months after Brian's death\n\f                                                                       5\n\n\n\n 1   had a separate adoption proceeding and a separate intervention\n\n 2   proceeding in a parental termination case in this Court, not in\n\n 3   Probate One but in Harris County.   In that case, she legally\n\n 4   took the exact opposite position, under oath, that she takes in\n\n 5   this lawsuit.   There she says, and you have to say this is a\n\n 6   matter of law, that I'm not married, I don't live with Brian\n\n 7   Johns, and I have no agreement with him to be married, and, in\n\n 8   fact, this child that I'm seeking to adopt in no way, shape or\n\n 9   form lives or has any connection to Brian Johns.   Now, four\n\n10   years later when there is money on the table, the ex-wife takes\n\n11   the exact opposite position, and not just with respect to\n\n12   herself, but with respect to the child who is not even actually\n\n13   adopted until seven months after Brian died.   And so one of the\n\n14   things that we are trying to do in proving that up for a\n\n15   summary judgment on judicial estoppel, because frankly, Judge,\n\n16   you can't swear under oath on Monday that the sky is blue and\n\n17   then swear under oath on Tuesday that the sky is red and get\n\n18   away with it.   So what we want to do is prove up the lies in a\n\n19   court of law.   Part that have is, we want the discovery record\n\n20   where Ms. Johns swears under oath to these facts so that we can\n\n21   come in here and prove them up, show them to the Court, and\n\n22   hopefully get this case resolved sooner rather than later so we\n\n23   don't have to spend too much more time in the jury trial.   So\n\n24   that's the basis of the motion against Ms. Young to get those\n\n25   records and the relevance of it.\n\f                                                                        6\n\n\n\n 1                   At the same time, the ex-wife has filed a Motion\n\n 2   to Compel against my clients.   And basically what she is\n\n 3   seeking is, this isn't one of those fishing expeditions, this\n\n 4   one of those let's dredge the lake and just see what we can\n\n 5   find.   For instance, there is a couple of things I understand\n\n 6   that we are really in dispute about.   The first one is she\n\n 7   wants the employment records from Brian's mother.    From a\n\n 8   substantive standpoint, I'm not sure what Brian's employment\n\n 9   records have to do with whether Vickie was married to Brian,\n\n10   whether they held themselves out, whether they lived together.\n\n11   And to make matters even more drastic, Judge, Francis Sowell is\n\n12   70-something years old, I don't think she has worked since\n\n13   1996, which is twenty years before Brian died, so I don't see\n\n14   how that is any way possibly relevant to this case.    Then they\n\n15   asked for Cory, the son's college education records.   Again,\n\n16   I'm not sure what a 25-year-olds college transcripts and\n\n17   college education records have anything to do with whether this\n\n18   woman lived with Brian, agreed to be married or held their self\n\n19   out to be married.   And then the last category of documents\n\n20   that are really at issue is the ex-wife says, I want every\n\n21   piece of correspondence between Brian and his son, between\n\n22   Brian and his mom, and between Brian's mom and son, for the\n\n23   entire course of their life in regards to -- with no limitation\n\n24   on subject matter.   Just by their very nature those requests\n\n25   are simply overbroad, Judge.    And I have a 2003 case from the\n\f                                                                          7\n\n\n\n 1   Texas Supreme Court that says that right on point.    And so what\n\n 2   we are asking, Judge, is we would like you to deny Ms. Young's\n\n 3   Motion to Quash, allow us -- and give a signed order that\n\n 4   provides her coverage under the law, allows us to get the\n\n 5   documents that I think are going to dispose of this case\n\n 6   finally in a very neat fashion, and then I would ask that you\n\n 7   would deny their Motion to Compel because educational records,\n\n 8   employment records, and every piece of correspondence between\n\n 9   people over the course of forty years simply isn't relevant to\n\n10   were they married, did they live together, and that they held\n\n11   themselves out to be married.    So that's the position.    And I\n\n12   will turn it over to opposing counsel.\n\n13                   THE COURT:   All right, thank you.\n\n14                   MS. YOUNG:   Judge, I am Bobbie Young.     I'm the\n\n15   attorney who was attorney ad litem for the child that was\n\n16   adopted in that CPS case.    I filed a motion requesting that the\n\n17   subpoena be quashed and not have to turn those records over\n\n18   under Texas Family Code Section 251.201 they are confidential.\n\n19   I can't turn them over without a court order.\n\n20                   And aside from that, I'm also asking for\n\n21   attorney's fees, the cost of my drafting this motion and being\n\n22   here today.   And I do have an order for however the Judge\n\n23   decides.\n\n24                   THE COURT:   Okay.   So you filed your Motion to\n\n25   Quash Subpoena and you attached an order.    Is that -- do you\n\f                                                                       8\n\n\n\n 1   have something different than what was attached for me to deal\n\n 2   with?\n\n 3                  MS. YOUNG:   No, Your Honor.    If the Order on\n\n 4   Motion to Quash is there, then that's the Order that I would\n\n 5   ask you to review.\n\n 6                  THE COURT:   Okay.    Well, I guess you would agree\n\n 7   that if I -- I guess perhaps if I quash the subpoena, you might\n\n 8   be entitled to your fees.   But if I order the records turned\n\n 9   over, then you probably wouldn't be.    I mean, you just you\n\n10   brought this to the Court's attention because of the statute\n\n11   that requires you to not release those kind of documents except\n\n12   without a court order or without a court order?\n\n13                  MS. YOUNG:   Your Honor, I brought it to the\n\n14   Court's attention for that reason.    But because I'm a solo\n\n15   practitioner and I had to take time out to file this motion, it\n\n16   would be my obligation to file this motion, I understand\n\n17   that --\n\n18                  THE COURT:   That's true, I understand.\n\n19                  MS. YOUNG:   It is taking time away from me as an\n\n20   attorney to have to deal with this.    I couldn't negotiate\n\n21   without --\n\n22                  THE COURT:   And so what would you say -- did you\n\n23   include anything about your fees?\n\n24                  MS. YOUNG:   I did not, Your Honor.   But if the\n\n25   Court would like to hear some testimony from me, I would do so.\n\f                                                                            9\n\n\n\n 1   I think it took me about a couple of hours to talk to everybody\n\n 2   involved, including the court where the orders were entered\n\n 3   with regard to the adoption and to the county attorney and\n\n 4   through my own separate research, because I want to be\n\n 5   cooperative with the Court and with counsel but I have to do it\n\n 6   under the law.   So it did take me at least two hours to do\n\n 7   that.   My hourly rate is $300 per hour.\n\n 8                    MR. HARDIN:   Your Honor, if the Court issues the\n\n 9   subpoena, we would agree to pay the attorney's fees, as I\n\n10   understand it, is $600, and that might take that issue off the\n\n11   Court's table.\n\n12                    THE COURT:    Okay.    And do you, for your side of\n\n13   it, do you have a proposed order?\n\n14                    MR. WYNNE:    We do.    It's basic as it can be,\n\n15   saying the Motion to Quash is denied.       Part of the problem is\n\n16   like, before we got here, Judge, we actually had this phone\n\n17   call where we said we would agree to pay.       We modified the\n\n18   subpoena to comply with the requests to switch it to the\n\n19   discovery file as opposed to the whole file, so the thought\n\n20   that, hey, Ms. Young has to come down because of something that\n\n21   we did and we weren't compliant, I mean --\n\n22                    MS. YOUNG:    I didn't mean to imply that.\n\n23                    THE COURT:    No, I understand.    I think it's, to\n\n24   me, it's just the normal process of trying to get this issue\n\n25   before the Court.\n\f                                                                        10\n\n\n\n 1                   MS. YOUNG:    Right.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:    I don't view it in any other way.     I\n\n 3   think everybody is doing their job in other words.\n\n 4                   MS. YOUNG:    That's all.\n\n 5                   THE COURT:    So, if you do have a proposed order,\n\n 6   I can either work off of --\n\n 7                   MR. WYNNE:    Judge, I know she had the proposed\n\n 8   order.   I think it just basically gives you the option of being\n\n 9   sustained or denied, granted or denied.\n\n10                   THE COURT:    Right.\n\n11                   MR. WYNNE:    What I would suggest is, we just\n\n12   circle -- if you are going to deny the Motion to Quash, have\n\n13   her turn over the documents with the understanding of the\n\n14   agreement on the record that we will pay the $600 for it, I\n\n15   think we can just circle \"denied\" and \"denied\", and have it\n\n16   signed today to get this going.\n\n17                   THE COURT:    Well, I will make the decision right\n\n18   after I go off the bench.    I will look at it.   I don't think I\n\n19   need until tomorrow.   But I will look at it and make sure I\n\n20   understand everything about the relief requested and both\n\n21   parties will know something by four PM.\n\n22                   MS. YOUNG:    And Your Honor, if I'm ordered to\n\n23   turn the documents over, if I could have a time certain in\n\n24   which to do that, and also, I have a case across the street\n\n25   that they are waiting for me on.\n\f                                                                         11\n\n\n\n 1                     THE COURT:    I will do that.   And you can be\n\n 2   excused and I will give you a time certain.       Any thoughts on\n\n 3   the timing of it if I agree with you?\n\n 4                     MR. WYNNE:    It depends on how voluminous it is,\n\n 5   so if it's not much --\n\n 6                     THE COURT:    By the way, is there a further\n\n 7   response to all of this?\n\n 8                     MR. FARAH:    We are on the Motion to Compel, Your\n\n 9   Honor.   Plus, we weren't even put on notice of this motion.\n\n10                     MS. YOUNG:    I didn't know about them at all.\n\n11                     MR. FARAH:    This is the first time we are\n\n12   hearing about all of this right now.\n\n13                     THE COURT:    So nobody else wants to speak up\n\n14   about the issue that we are talking about right now?\n\n15                     MR. OSTROM:   Well, the problem is, Your Honor,\n\n16   we don't know if those records have any relation to Ms. Johns.\n\n17   And to the extent there is something we need to assert, we have\n\n18   not seen those.\n\n19                     THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n20                     MR. OSTROM:   So right now we are left with this\n\n21   subpoena to compel that we have not been afforded notice of and\n\n22   so we really don't know what the next step is going to be after\n\n23   these documents are produced.      Apparently, they want to use\n\n24   them for a summary judgment.      Maybe we have an objection to\n\n25   them, maybe we don't.    We don't know right now.\n\f                                                                         12\n\n\n\n 1                    MR. WYNNE:    Judge, here is the problem with\n\n 2   that, I mean, your client's discovery response is that you have\n\n 3   an obligation to produce and you haven't, so we are having to\n\n 4   subpoena third parties to get them.     So if you will simply tell\n\n 5   your clients ex-lawyer who has the right to the file to turn\n\n 6   over the entire file, then there is no need to subpoena anyone,\n\n 7   because it's her works.   So it's a little -- sir, I'm a little\n\n 8   taken aback by the fact that --\n\n 9                    THE COURT:    Well, if I order the records turned\n\n10   over, I will instruct everybody to have a copy of what's been\n\n11   turned over.\n\n12                    MR. FARAH:    And Judge, we have tried to get\n\n13   these records.\n\n14                    THE COURT:    Whether or not you should have a\n\n15   copy or not, I will order that turned over so everybody is on\n\n16   the same page about what's out there.\n\n17                    MR. OSTROM:   Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n18                    MS. YOUNG:    May I be excused?\n\n19                    THE COURT:    Yes, you may.   So what do we have\n\n20   left, your Motion to Compel?\n\n21                    MR. FARAH:    He kind of presented our Motion to\n\n22   Compel for us, Mr. Wynne did, but I would like to present it\n\n23   from our perspective.\n\n24                    THE COURT:    He is good at that, isn't he?   Takes\n\n25   the ball and just runs with it.\n\f                                                                        13\n\n\n\n 1                    MR. FARAH:   Sure.   But if you look at the Motion\n\n 2   to Compel, Mr. Wynne is going past the most important part of\n\n 3   our Motion to Compel.   We served them with discovery on January\n\n 4   28th, 2015.   The responses were due on February 28th, 2015.       We\n\n 5   didn't get the responses until June 5th, 2015.     So under the\n\n 6   Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, they waived all objections and\n\n 7   privileges because they didn't respond timely, so whatever\n\n 8   objections he has are not valid at this point.     And that's our\n\n 9   main position, Your Honor.\n\n10                    THE COURT:   But your theory is, parties get a\n\n11   divorce, and then somehow in that interim time before death\n\n12   there is a common-law marriage, right?\n\n13                    MR. FARAH:   They get divorced and that same day\n\n14   are common-law married until his death.     They go home together\n\n15   after --\n\n16                    THE COURT:   Okay.   Then so there is some, I\n\n17   don't know, buyer's remorse probably doesn't -- there is some\n\n18   remorse about it and that very day they somehow agreed to be\n\n19   married again?\n\n20                    MR. FARAH:   It's not remorse, they planned ahead\n\n21   of time because of the adoption process.\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Oh, there was some adoption process\n\n23   to this.   I guess all I'm saying is, all I'm trying to get at\n\n24   is, are you asking for records prior to the divorce?     Are all\n\n25   of these records post formal divorce?     I mean, I was thinking I\n\f                                                                      14\n\n\n\n 1   was nearing something that you were going back in time to point\n\n 2   to when it doesn't seem to be relevant to a common-law\n\n 3   marriage.\n\n 4                  MR. WYNNE:    So for Brian's mother who --\n\n 5                  THE COURT:    Hang on.    Go ahead and let him\n\n 6   finish.\n\n 7                  MR. WYNNE:    I was trying to explain.\n\n 8                  MR. FARAH:    I know he wants to do it all but,\n\n 9   let's go request by request, okay?      The educational records for\n\n10   Corey Johns, okay?    We are specifically -- we can make our\n\n11   request more specific and I discussed it with Bob before this\n\n12   hearing, we are specifically requesting information on an\n\n13   administrative hearing that he was part of at Southern\n\n14   University where he was kicked out of Southern University for a\n\n15   crime he allegedly committed and what we are trying to find is\n\n16   my client you wrote a letter on their clients' behalf, saying\n\n17   that she was the stepmother of this individual or Corey Johns,\n\n18   and that she would make sure that he would stay out of trouble\n\n19   and that they were living in her and Brian's Johns' home, and\n\n20   so an on and so on.    So that letter is post the divorce and\n\n21   very much relevant as to the elements of a common-law marriage.\n\n22   Because if there is this letter that she presented to the Court\n\n23   that says he is going to be living with me and his father in\n\n24   our home and I'm his stepmother, that's very much relevant to\n\n25   the common-law issue.    So I don't see why that would not be\n\f                                                                       15\n\n\n\n 1   discoverable.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:   All right.\n\n 3                   MR. FARAH:   Especially since they blew the\n\n 4   deadline to file their objections and to respond by four\n\n 5   months.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:   Well, I'm not saying it is or not.\n\n 7   I haven't decided.    I'm just trying to hash it out.\n\n 8                   MR. FARAH:   I know that.   I just wanted to\n\n 9   remind you of that.    And then we got -- so then we have got No.\n\n10   17, or sorry, No. 20, a signed copy of the authorization to\n\n11   obtain employment records for Francis Sowell who is the\n\n12   Administrator of the Estate.    Well, okay, in this case, there\n\n13   is testimony and evidence that Mrs. Sowell planted a password\n\n14   at the hospital so that certain people couldn't come in and out\n\n15   of the hospital to visit Brian.    Well, my client said that she\n\n16   tried to go visit her husband.    But because she didn't have --\n\n17   they didn't give her the password, she could not get past the\n\n18   desk to go see her husband and talk with him and meet with him.\n\n19   And we are trying to establish, which we have a reason to\n\n20   believe, that she has strong relationship at that hospital that\n\n21   gave her that power to exclude Vickie from seeing her husband\n\n22   while he is on his death bed.    And that's very much relevant\n\n23   because at trial they are going to argue that she didn't even\n\n24   come and try to see her husband at the hospital while he is\n\n25   being treated for these serious burns, which is absolutely\n\f                                                                       16\n\n\n\n 1   untruthful and we think those records are relevant as to Mrs.\n\n 2   Francis Sowell's credibility.    I mean, in her deposition, 26\n\n 3   pages to try and identify her work history, she was avoiding\n\n 4   every question.    She would not give me the information to\n\n 5   straightforward questions like, where did you work?     Give me\n\n 6   all the hospitals you worked at as a nurse.    What capacity did\n\n 7   you work?   And she was completely evasive.   So we reason to\n\n 8   believe that she is not being cooperative and hiding something\n\n 9   that we think is relevant in this case.    And that was No. 20,\n\n10   Your Honor, Request No. 20, which is in the Motion to Compel.\n\n11                     And then we have Request 22 through 26.   And we\n\n12   can narrow this down.    We did ask for broad requests but we can\n\n13   narrow it down from the period of time that Vickie and Brian\n\n14   first got married in 2007 until his death in 2012, a five-year\n\n15   period, of e-mails between the family members and these\n\n16   requests.   And I will tell you why that's important.    Brian and\n\n17   Vickie were legally married for three years and in those three\n\n18   years there was complete resentment and hatred towards Vickie\n\n19   from the family while they were legally married.    So from the\n\n20   beginning, she was not welcome in the Johns family.     And she\n\n21   had to fight and fight and fight to show that she was part of\n\n22   this family.   And there is an e-mail that she wrote to the\n\n23   family asking them to stay out of her and Brian's relationship,\n\n24   to let them live their lives and be peaceful and happy and move\n\n25   on with their lives.    That was the only e-mail produced by the\n\f                                                                         17\n\n\n\n 1   Plaintiffs in this case.      We believe that there was e-mails\n\n 2   going back and forth between the family members after receiving\n\n 3   this e-mail.   And other e-mails that will show that Brian and\n\n 4   Vickie were married or that they didn't know Brian and Vickie\n\n 5   were divorced.   And we think that's relevant to some of the\n\n 6   elements to establish a common-law marriage.\n\n 7                    So, you know, we can narrow the scope.      Instead\n\n 8   of any and all for infinity, from 2007 to 2012, I have no\n\n 9   problem doing that.   And that's it, Your Honor.      That's all we\n\n10   got.\n\n11                    THE COURT:    Anybody else?\n\n12                    MR. WYNNE:    May I calmly respond, Judge?\n\n13                    THE COURT:    Sure.   I have never seen you any\n\n14   other way.\n\n15                    MR. WYNNE:    I appreciate that.\n\n16                    THE COURT:    I don't know if that's true, but go\n\n17   ahead.\n\n18                    MR. WYNNE:    What I would like to do is address a\n\n19   little bit of each of these things, because I just don't agree\n\n20   with many of the things that were just said.        The education\n\n21   records Mr. Farah referenced an administrative proceeding at\n\n22   Corey's school, there is nothing in this entire record that\n\n23   supports that statement.      In fact, in Ms. John's deposition we\n\n24   asked her about it and the only thing she said was that after\n\n25   Corey got into trouble at school I went with Brian to pick him\n\f                                                                        18\n\n\n\n 1   up.   Well, guess what?   Corey has been deposed twice in this\n\n 2   case and he said the exact same thing.     In fact, I have the\n\n 3   deposition and I can show you that everything matches and there\n\n 4   is not a single shred of testimony about some letter.    And\n\n 5   truthfully, if there was a letter, how come no one can tell us\n\n 6   who it was sent to, when it was sent, you know, why doesn't she\n\n 7   have a copy of this if it was from 2010 or 2011?    She has no\n\n 8   information about this letter except what her counsel says now.\n\n 9   So what we are going to do, what they are proposing is, Judge,\n\n10   this young man has protected federal rights under FERPA to\n\n11   these educational records.    This woman who has got a claim for\n\n12   money, her lawyer says that there is a letter, so now, Judge,\n\n13   issue a subpoena directed by the State of Texas to an\n\n14   institution in the State of Louisiana that's protected by\n\n15   federal FERPA law so we can get what?    A letter that no one has\n\n16   any details about.    So I would say that that goes straight to\n\n17   the heart of a fishing expedition.\n\n18                     The employment records of Mrs. Sowell, again,\n\n19   she has been deposed twice in this case.    She was asked these\n\n20   exact questions.    In her deposition, I have that right here,\n\n21   Judge, I will show it to you as well, she was asked, \"Did you\n\n22   know anyone at the hospital before Brian got there when he was\n\n23   injured?   No.\"   What she testified is that she worked with a\n\n24   famous burn doctor, Dennis Blocker, down in Galveston, in the\n\n25   late 70's and 80's.    That's it.   That's her connection.   Oh,\n\f                                                                        19\n\n\n\n 1   and by the way, Dr. Blocker, he died in 1984, and the hospital\n\n 2   she worked at shut down in 1996.   So again, like this secret\n\n 3   password, she was asked about all that in deposition.      She said\n\n 4   the hospital gave her a password and she gave it to her kids\n\n 5   because that's who she needed to give it to.    I'm not sure this\n\n 6   nefarious plot to keep someone out is coming from, but in any\n\n 7   event, there is just simply no relevance to those.\n\n 8                   And then in the correspondence, there is only\n\n 9   one piece of correspondence that our client has that in any way\n\n10   came from Ms. John's, Vickie Johns, or that references her.        We\n\n11   produced it.   In their deposition they were asked, it seems\n\n12   Vickie had no presence at all in this family, and Corey Francis\n\n13   says, yeah, that's right, she didn't, we just didn't even know\n\n14   she existed.   And what is most important is, it's funny because\n\n15   Vickie Johns, the ex-wife, hasn't produced a single piece of\n\n16   correspondence between the family.   I mean, she has not\n\n17   produced a single e-mail between her and her purported husband\n\n18   over the course of three years.    Not a single letter.    Not a\n\n19   single phone call.   Not a single text.   Nothing.   And so what\n\n20   she is trying to do is say, well, I can't find anything even\n\n21   though I was married to him for four years so y'all must have\n\n22   something, so give me everything under the sun.      I mean, there\n\n23   is no time limitation.   There is no subject matter limitation.\n\n24   And frankly, when you look at the volume of stuff that we have\n\n25   produced, and we have given them seven authorizations, they\n\f                                                                      20\n\n\n\n 1   didn't even know what Brian's bank accounts were, his\n\n 2   employment records.   We identified it for them and signed\n\n 3   authorizations giving it to them.   The only the two\n\n 4   authorizations that we had a problem with were employment\n\n 5   records from 20 years ago and educational records from a young\n\n 6   man that had nothing to do with this case.\n\n 7                  And so, Judge, they talk about this waiver\n\n 8   argument, and so I want to address that on two bases.    We were\n\n 9   in here for the first six months of this year arguing about the\n\n10   Plea to the Jurisdiction and our Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n11   They had asked for discovery during that same time period and I\n\n12   had told them that we were not putting anyone up for\n\n13   depositions or producing discovery until that is ruled on.\n\n14   When that was ruled on, we immediately produced all our\n\n15   documents and we turned over our stuff, and so under that\n\n16   waiver there is a clear exception for a great cost.     I think if\n\n17   there is ever a case for that, it's this one.\n\n18                  And then secondly, if you will notice, I believe\n\n19   that the exhibits, the discovery exhibits filed by his ex-wife\n\n20   are not signed in the record.   Under Rule 191.3, the Court\n\n21   cannot enforce an unsigned discovery piece of evidence.     So\n\n22   whatever it is, it's unenforceable at this point.   And so there\n\n23   is a ton of grounds to simply deny this.   And it is not as if\n\n24   they haven't deposed the people or gotten the documents that\n\n25   really are relevant, cellular phone records, bank accounts,\n\f                                                                           21\n\n\n\n 1   things that would show what the nature of the relationship was.\n\n 2   So at that point, Judge, I will pass.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:    All right.\n\n 4                     MR. FARAH:    Judge, just because there are\n\n 5   pending motions doesn't give him the unilateral right to hold\n\n 6   off on actual discovery.       Okay?   He could have asked for a Rule\n\n 7   11 Agreement.     There is several ways you can handle that.     He\n\n 8   can't just say, look, let's wait until after these motions are\n\n 9   heard and we get a ruling and then we will answer your\n\n10   discovery that we sent you four or five months ago.        It doesn't\n\n11   work like that.\n\n12                     Second, these authorizations he was talking\n\n13   about, we just got these authorizations four weeks ago, because\n\n14   we have to call them and e-mail them and ask them for these\n\n15   authorizations over and over and over again, and finally they\n\n16   decided, all right, we will send you these authorizations a few\n\n17   weeks before this Motion to Compel here.        This was nine months\n\n18   after we sent out the Request for Production for these\n\n19   authorizations.    And now they are trying to make it seem like\n\n20   they have been willing advocates in this case, producing\n\n21   documents.   They have been contesting this thing since January.\n\n22   These were due in February and now we are in September.         He\n\n23   can't unilaterally state we are not going to ask for these\n\n24   until after the motion, after our motions are ruled on.\n\n25                     On some of those other points, we are not asking\n\f                                                                        22\n\n\n\n 1   for subpoena.   Why not give us an authorization and we will\n\n 2   look at the records from the hospital, the son's records from\n\n 3   the hospital?   And give us an authorization and we will go get\n\n 4   the administrative records from the administrative hearing at\n\n 5   Southern University in Baton Rouge.   We have a right to\n\n 6   discovery to prove up our case.   It's our burden of proof and\n\n 7   we can't prove up our case without evidence, and they are\n\n 8   preventing us from us getting that very evidence.    And that's\n\n 9   all we are asking, Judge.    We are just asking for the\n\n10   opportunity to get the evidence to prove our case.    I pass.\n\n11                   THE COURT:   All right.   I will just look at it\n\n12   and probably come up with a definitive response by tomorrow\n\n13   afternoon.\n\n14                   MR. WYNNE:   Judge, what I would like to do is I\n\n15   would like to hand you copies of Corey Johns' deposition where\n\n16   it's marked where he is talking about the educational\n\n17   administrative incident in connection with Vickie showing up,\n\n18   Vickie Johns' deposition that corroborates one hundred percent\n\n19   Corey's deposition, and then also Francis Sowell's deposition\n\n20   marked where it shows where she is talking about specifically\n\n21   saying, under oath, that I haven't been working since '96, and\n\n22   I didn't know anyone at this hospital at the time we got there,\n\n23   and talking about how she got the password and what she did\n\n24   with it, which I think almost conclusively rebuts a lot of\n\n25   those arguments, Judge.\n\f                                                                         23\n\n\n\n 1                   THE COURT:    Do you care if I have that?   I have\n\n 2   already heard that but it's just part of what I'm going to look\n\n 3   at as I look through these requests and whether I ought to\n\n 4   grant the Motion to Compel in certain respects or all respects\n\n 5   or not.\n\n 6                   MR. OSTROM:    Your Honor, I think the only\n\n 7   concern I have about this is that we are taking the word of an\n\n 8   interested witness.   Those people are who we are going to\n\n 9   depose and, yeah, they may have deposed in their deposition or\n\n10   testify at trial, they may have deposed in their deposition we\n\n11   knew nothing about an administrative hearing, but it sure in\n\n12   the hell would be interesting that when we get those records\n\n13   that there was, in fact, an administrative hearing and he lied\n\n14   under oath.   The jury is going to hear about that --\n\n15                   MR. WYNNE:    Whoa, whoa, don't call my client a\n\n16   liar.\n\n17                   MR. OSTROM:    So that's the point.   They can say\n\n18   whatever they want to say.    But we have a right to verify that\n\n19   through third parties, through other institutions, through\n\n20   e-mails that they say, well, this was all about Johns.      Well,\n\n21   there may be an e-mail that doesn't mention, quote, Johns, or\n\n22   Vickie Johns, and it's just between son and mother complaining\n\n23   about the Decedent's choice of women.    You know, we are not --\n\n24   it's not incumbent upon us to figure out exactly the\n\n25   phraseology that's in there.    That's part of the discovery\n\f                                                                       24\n\n\n\n 1   process, so I'm not sure how this stuff is relevant to a\n\n 2   decision on whether, you know, this is something that's\n\n 3   discoverable or not.   I think the questions are in the scope.\n\n 4                   The other thing that wasn't mentioned is that,\n\n 5   you know, ultimately there will be a trial if the Court doesn't\n\n 6   grant some summary judgment one way or the other, ultimately,\n\n 7   there will be a trial about apportionment of damages that goes\n\n 8   to the relationship, the relationship all of these individuals\n\n 9   had with the Decedent and their relationship amongst each\n\n10   other.   And the jury is going to hear all that.    And I think\n\n11   this, the e-mails, and the -- and what they -- what she did for\n\n12   the family or didn't do for the family all becomes relevant at\n\n13   that stage.   So I think there is really kind of two parties.\n\n14   We are looking at the common-law spouse, but once you get past\n\n15   that, you are going to try a case on proportionment and\n\n16   relationship.   And all of that evidence is going to be\n\n17   contained in the same group of documents.\n\n18                   MR. HARDIN:   What authority do you have the\n\n19   authority to compel somebody to turn over federally FERPA\n\n20   protected material, because it's not about the issue of the\n\n21   subpoena over there or going that process, they want to take a\n\n22   shortcut and have you compel us to have a student's records\n\n23   turned over, and I'm not sure how they get there.\n\n24                   THE COURT:    Yeah, that's an interesting\n\n25   argument.   There have been other instances where, you know, a\n\f                                                                       25\n\n\n\n 1   state court judge is essentially being asked to potentially\n\n 2   violate what federal statutes would tell him or her.\n\n 3                  MR. HARDIN:   Right.   And so for that reason\n\n 4   also, we would ask the Court to deny it.   If they want to try\n\n 5   to get it, they could always go through to trying to subpoena\n\n 6   on a third party or so, something that, as Mr. Wynne has said\n\n 7   repeatedly, we can't find any evidence that it ever happened.\n\n 8   Part of the reason for all of these authorizations that we have\n\n 9   even given them for stuff that we don't even believe is\n\n10   discoverable was to try to keep our trial date, because they\n\n11   threatened to come in and ask for a continuance if we didn't\n\n12   sign these authorizations that allowed them to get this.\n\n13                  As you know, we were ready to go to trial in the\n\n14   fall of last year, back when Dow was still in it.   They have\n\n15   intervened and the Court, as I understand, granted it and my\n\n16   memory is the trial was moved to May.    Now we are in November\n\n17   and this family, this has been going on for quite awhile, and\n\n18   so we have been trying to do anything.   That's why I stand up\n\n19   and volunteered to pay her attorney's fees.    We are trying to\n\n20   do everything we can to make sure we hold that trial date for\n\n21   this family has been waiting a couple of years, and to ask this\n\n22   Court to compel us to violate -- to turn over federally\n\n23   protected material when there is absolutely no showing that is\n\n24   relevant to anything.   Keep in mind what he just said, that\n\n25   even if there had been such an administrative hearing, it had\n\f                                                                         26\n\n\n\n 1   nothing to do as to whether she was the common-law spouse.\n\n 2   They want to compel -- they want to know about a letter that\n\n 3   she wrote.    They haven't even shown how it would ever be\n\n 4   admissible.   A self-serving letter establishing one of the\n\n 5   party's legal position in the litigation is not admissible.\n\n 6   It's hearsay.    It's not an admission of a party opponent.    It\n\n 7   doesn't come in.   What they are asking you for is to compel us\n\n 8   to give up certain rights so they can go see if there is an\n\n 9   inadmissible letter that they can find.    There is no evidence\n\n10   that it even exists.   So we would respectfully ask -- he has\n\n11   given them on seven, I think, from nine authorizations.       We\n\n12   drew the line with this one and a woman that has not worked for\n\n13   twenty years.    They have absolutely no evidence from any\n\n14   source, forget that our client has denied it per se, but they\n\n15   have no evidence from any source that previous employment that\n\n16   ended some twenty years ago at a hospital that no longer exists\n\n17   is somehow relevant to her current claim that she resumed a\n\n18   common-law marriage after they dissolved the legal marriage.\n\n19                    At the end of the day, it's going to turn out to\n\n20   be a fraudulent claim that really subjects her to criminal\n\n21   prosecution, and so to have the trial delayed or us giving up\n\n22   certain FERPA protected rights in order to basically keep\n\n23   stretching out what is going to be determined a fraud on the\n\n24   Court.   If the Court remembers, you lingered very hard on it as\n\n25   did the magistrate on this issue there has already been a\n\f                                                                          27\n\n\n\n 1   determination in another court in another proceeding she was\n\n 2   not married.   There was no common-law marriage.      And we urge\n\n 3   that, obviously, that that was the law of the case and that was\n\n 4   it.   The Court decided to grant the Bill of Review and that's\n\n 5   how we are in this place to begin with.      So now a woman who has\n\n 6   been found not to be common-law married has now come up with\n\n 7   these different claims and as an attempt to prove it wants us\n\n 8   to give up federally protected rights and wants a state judge\n\n 9   to order us to give up those rights in another state.       With all\n\n10   that said and done, we respectfully ask to not be compelled to\n\n11   sign these authorizations.     We will have to figure out, all\n\n12   right, what do we do?   Do we give in on that or do we take that\n\n13   up on appeal and lose our trial setting?       That's the Hobson's\n\n14   choice that we have got.     And I guess what we could do is, we\n\n15   could refuse to comply with the order and you could find us in\n\n16   contempt and then that contempt would be the only thing we\n\n17   could appeal or we could look to a mandamus.       But in any of\n\n18   those situations we lose our trial setting.       And that's the\n\n19   most valuable thing to us right now.       So we would respectfully\n\n20   ask the Court to deny the motion.\n\n21                   THE COURT:    All right.\n\n22                   MR. FARAH:    Judge, the only one holding them\n\n23   back from this trial setting is themselves.       We sent this\n\n24   discovery back in January.     They should have responded in\n\n25   February and we could have resolved these but they keep holding\n\f                                                                        28\n\n\n\n 1   back.   All of these objections and privileges that they are\n\n 2   talking about are gone.     All they had to do was answer the\n\n 3   discovery in thirty days.     These are all gone.\n\n 4                   Second of all, Corey is a party to this\n\n 5   litigation.   As a party to this litigation, he has a\n\n 6   responsibility to hand over documents that are requested from\n\n 7   him in his prosecution of his claims and he can hand over an\n\n 8   affidavit or authorization to get his own records.       There is no\n\n 9   subpoena required.   He has the right to his own records.       If he\n\n10   signs the authorization, we can get those records.       This is not\n\n11   my first case where I had to get educational records for a\n\n12   student.   This is not a novel issue.      That's all I have to say.\n\n13   Thank you.\n\n14                   THE COURT:    All right, I will let y'all know\n\n15   something by tomorrow afternoon.     Anything further?\n\n16                   MR. WYNNE:    No.   Thank you.\n\n17                   MR. FARAH:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n18                   MR.

Most communication is ALWAYS\n     NEGATIVE ..... for our mother's, you have taught us the old saying (if you\n     don't have nothing good or nice to say,don't say nothing) Unfortunately\n     we have forgotten that along the way .Life is hard enough to get thru\n     from day to day but we have experienced so much drama from s·ome of\n     you,it has to stop, thats why w~ have chosen to stay to ourselves.The\n     majority of our famililes are women,and with the exception of one of my\n     sisters Kim, all of us women have been married or is married.You\n     personally know how it feel to have in-laws.You are one or have been\n     one.How does yourmother-in law,sis in law,brother in law,father in law\n     TREAT YOU,ACKNOWLEDGE YOU,RESPECT YOU (or lack thereof) Do. they .\n     constantly discuss in your presence your ex-,-girlfriends,wives or\n     boyfriends ? How many of you have done that to me & Brian.Have we EVER\n     brought up your ex's or your previous baby mama's or daddy's or even\n     your spouses ex baby mama's or daddy's - NO WE HAVEN'T BECAUSE WE\n     RESPECT EVERYONE & THEIR MARRIAGES.Give us a break.Brian & I are\n     together,happily, get over it and ACCEPT IT,IT \"AIN'T gonna change\"He &\n     I have definately kept in alot of things we have wanted to say to you\n     our family members on both sides for all the negative things some of you\n     have done and said to our faces & behind one of our backs,but we jointly\n     are here to tell you from now on regardless of who you are, your\n     behavior & disrespect is no longer acceptable.The most important thing\n\fis that we love each other,thats it, as our family that should be all\nyou care about,not petty things & conunents like \"we are up under each\nother too much or all the time• How ignorant is that? We like each\nother,we are extremely attracted to each other,we are in love,why does\nthat make some of you annoyed or is it JEALOUSY.If we choose to breathe\nfor one another,thats our buisness,it works for us,maybe if some of you\npay more attention to your own SPOUSE & and try some of our techniques\nyou will have a much better relationship & want to be around your spouse\nmore. We rarely hear from most of you except the o.ccassional email.\nforward,how about spending some quality time with us.Some of you make\nexcuses as to why you haven't come to visit but we are expected to come\nto you,thats a 2-way street.We are only surrounding ourselves with\npositive people (friends,family) we want to raise our children in such\nan atmosphere,give us that chance,stop telling us every step to make\naccording to you & your path,GOD DID not ordain you as his helper or\noverseer to his kingdom.We are intelligent adults & we want to share our\nlives with you ALL.Let us make our own decisions,and raise our children\nas WE see fit.To my family, always respect my husband,to love me is to\nlove & accept him .To Brian's family the absolute same thing.To love him\nis to respect & accept me.If anyone would like to address this letter\nwith us ,please feel free to call or come by anytime.Since we are all\nadults,I figured I didnt nave to put individual names to every\nstatement, as all of you read this letter you know what part pertains to\nyou as an individual .................

Johns on September 17, 2011 through a friend on facebook. We continued\nto date and in the month of October of 2011, we decided to make our relationship exclusive with each\nother, And as time passed I got to know his son Corey Johns, met his mother Mrs. Francis Sowell and\nother family members including his two dogs Max and Koi. I would spend my weekends at his home\n(3827 Saxon Hollow Court, Friendswood, TX 77546). Our relationship continued and we were talking\nabout our future together and moving into his home in the month of September 2012 when we\ncompleted a year in our relationship. Then that tragic day in July of 2012, when I received a phone call\nfrom his sister Pam Jahns-Roberson telling me that Brian was in a terrible accident at work and that he\nwas in the ICU at UTMB Hospital in Galveston. That phone call changed my life forever. My 11 months\nwith Brian were amazing and I was privileged to have been able to spend and enjoy the last 11 months\nof Brian's life with him.\n\fOl/2~/2015 ~HO l~l         38     ~AX                                                                                        l?JOH/033     f\n                                                                                                                                         • I\n                                                                                                                                           !\n\n\n             HI.PAAAUTHOIUZATION TO DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION\n\n TO:\n           Physichln, Provide1· Ol' Fitcilay Numc:\n          Street Aclclr<~Ss:\n          CUy, State, 7.1p;\n          Plwne Numhl.ll':\n\n l'ATillNT:\n\n          Puticnt Name;                                                 Briun B.

Relator contends that Respondent’s order denying,\n\nin part, Relator’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses against Plaintiffs in the\n\ntrial court, Frances Sowell and Corey Johns is an abuse of discretion violating Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 193.2(e), 196.2, 197.2(a) (which provides the applicable deadline for a\n\nparty to file its written response to requests for production and responses to request\n\nfor interrogatories). Relator has no adequate appellate remedy. Relator seeks a writ\n\nof mandamus compelling Respondent to order the objections of Plaintiffs to be\n\nwithdrawn and ordering responses to Relator’s Requests for Productions,\n\nInterrogatories and Second Request for Production.\n\n      On January 28, 2015, Relator, Vicki Johns, propounded the following\n\ndiscovery requests: (1) Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ First Request for Production to\n\nPlaintiff Frances Sowell and Corey Johns, (2) Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ First Set of\n\nInterrogatories to Plaintiff Corey Johns, Individually and as Heir of Brain Edward\n\nJohns, Deceased, and (3) Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ First Set of Interrogatories to\n\nPlaintiff Frances Sowell, Individually and as Heir of Brian Edward Johns, Deceased,\n\nand as Administrator for the Estate of Brain Edward Johns, Deceased. [Tab4]\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fSpecifically, Relator requested an authorization to obtain educational records for\n\nCorey Johns:\n\n      No. 13: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain educational records for\n      Corey Johns attached hereto as Exhibit “B.”\n      [Tab5]\n\n       Relator has requested the authorization in order to obtain the administrative\n\nfile which contains a letter written by Relator to the administration on Corey Johns’\n\nbehalf during the administrative proceeding at Southern University. This letter\n\nwhich was written by Relator includes facts which support her common law\n\nmarriage to Corey Johns’ father, Brian Johns.\n\n      Additionally, Relator requested an authorization to obtain the employment\n\nrecords of Frances Sowell:\n\n      No. 20: A signed copy of the authorization to obtain employment records for\n      Frances Sowell attached hereto as Exhibit “D.”\n      [Tab5]\n\n      Relator has requested records in order to establish that France Sowell, the\n\nadministrator of Brian Johns’ estate, has a strong relationship at the hospital where\n\nBrian was taken after the incident. France Sowell’s relationship with the hospital\n\ngave her the power and ability to exclude Relator from seeing her husband while he\n\nwas on his deathbed. [Tab2, (Transcript P15,L11-12)]\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      Plaintiffs served their responses and objections on June 5, 2015, over four\n\nmonths after the due date. [Tab5; Tab6] The Plaintiffs’ responses included numerous\n\nobjections to Intervenor Vicki Johns’ Requests for Production and Interrogatories.\n\n[Tab5; Tab6]\n\n      Additionally, Intervenor, Vicki Johns’ Second Requests for Production to\n\nPlaintiffs Francis Sowell and Corey Johns were propounded on March 27, 2015. The\n\nresponses were due on April 27, 2015. [Tab7] Plaintiffs responded to the requests\n\non June 11, 2015, over a month and a half late. [Tab8] Again, Plaintiffs objected to\n\nthe requests for production and did not provide any answers or responsive\n\ndocuments.\n\n      On June 16, 2015, Relator filed a Motion to Compel Discovery responses from\n\nPlaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns. The answers to said Interrogatories and\n\nRequests for Production are necessary for Relator to properly prepare her case for\n\ntrial as well as counter attacks on her marriage which have already been made by\n\nPlaintiffs. Given Plaintiffs have already contested Relator’s common law spouse\n\nstatus in a multitude of ways, Relator needs the information sought to support her\n\ncommon law marriage.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Respondent’s ’s Order Denying Relator’s Motion to Compel Discovery\n\nResponse pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 215.1 (b) was an abuse of discretion by\n\nignoring the Plaintiff’s failure to timely and adequately respond to Intervenor’s\n\nInterrogatories and Intervenor’s Request for Production. Relator has no adequate\n\nappellate remedy.\n\n                                       ARGUMENT\n\n      A. Plaintiffs have waived their objections to Relator’s discovery requests\n      when Plaintiffs failed to timely assert their objections. Therefore, the\n      court should compel production.\n      Mandamus will issue to correct a clear abuse of discretion or a violation of a\n\nduty imposed by law when there is no adequate remedy by appeal.

A trial court abuses its discretion if it reaches a decision so\n\narbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law, or if\n\nit clearly fails to analyze or apply the law correctly.

The court held that relator in the Jampole case did not\n\nhave an adequate appellate remedy because denial of this discovery would have\n\neffectively prevented relator from proving the material allegations of his claim. Id.\n\nat 576. Additionally, the court expressed that a remedy by appeal in a discovery\n\nmandamus is not adequate when a party is required to “try his lawsuit, debilitated by\n\nthe denial of proper discovery, only to have the lawsuit rendered a certain nullity on\n\nappeal…” Id. Similarly, if Relator in the present case is denied mandamus relief she\n\nwould be prevented from discovery of evidence which would assist in developing\n\n\n                                         14\n\fthe merits of her common law marriage to Brian Johns. Specifically, Relator would\n\nbe prevented from attaining documents from Plaintiff Corey John’s educational\n\nrecords, including the letter she wrote on behalf of Corey Johns stating that she was\n\nhis stepmother and that he would be living at her and Brian Johns’ home after his\n\narrest, around September/October of 2010 and during Relator’s common marriage\n\nwith Brian Johns. [Tab2, (Transcript P14,L12-20)]\n\n      Additionally, Relator would be prevented from establishing Plaintiff, Frances\n\nSowell’s relationship with the hospital and treating staff where Brian Johns was\n\ntaken after the explosion. After her initial visit to the hospital on July 17, 2012,\n\nRelator was prevented from seeing her dying husband as a result of Plaintiff, Frances\n\nSowell setting a password with hospital staff. Relator requested an authorization to\n\nobtain the employment Records of Frances, in order to establish that France Sowell,\n\nthe administrator of Brian Johns’ estate, has a strong relationship at the hospital.\n\nRelator intends to show that France Sowell’s relationship with the hospital gave her\n\nthe power and ability to exclude Relator from seeing her husband while he was on\n\nhis death bed.\n\n      Relator would be further deprived of establishing her common law marriage\n\nwith Brian Johns by denied access to correspondence between Brian Johns’ and his\n\nfamily and/or between his family members. Relator has testified to the resentment\n\nand hatred she received from Brian Johns’ family during their marriage and after\n                                         15\n\fBrian’s death. [Tab1, (Deposition P135,L7-25;P136,L1-3)] Plaintiffs’ previously\n\nproduced an e-mail sent by Relator to several members of Brian Johns’ family,\n\nincluding Plaintiff Frances Sowell, requesting that the family stay out of their\n\nrelationship and allow them to move on with their lives because they loved each\n\nother. [Tab9] This was the only email produced by Plaintiffs in respond to Relator’s\n\nrequest for production. Accordingly, Relator has reason to believe that there are\n\nvarious e-mails between Brian Johns’ family members that will evince that Relator\n\nand Brian Johns maintained a common law marriage after their formal divorce or\n\nthat they were not aware of a formal divorce. As such, this discovery goes to the\n\nheart of establishing the elements of Relator’s common law marriage claim, and\n\nfurther denying Relator’s discovery of such evidence would prejudice and hinder her\n\nability to support the merits of her claim. Additionally, Relator needs these\n\ncorrespondence and emails between Brian and his family in order to defend against\n\nCorey Johns, Frances Sowell and James Johns, Sr.’s wrongful death damages.\n\nApportionment of the wrongful death damages will be determined by the\n\nrelationship of each individual with decedent, Brian Edward Johns, further justifying\n\nRelator’s need for such correspondence. [Tab2, (Transcript P24,L5-13)]\n\n      Furthermore, Relator agreed at the hearing on Relator’s Motion to Compel to\n\nnarrow the time period for Request for Production No. 22-26 to narrow the request\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fto correspondence between 2007, the time Brian and Vicki were initially married,\n\nuntil 2012, the time of Brian Johns’ death. [Tab2, (Transcript P16,L11-16)]\n\n      Finally, remedy by appeal may be inadequate where the trial court disallows\n\ndiscovery and the missing discovery cannot be made part of the appellate record and\n\nthe reviewing court is unable to evaluate the effect of the trial court’s error on the\n\nrecord before it.

Should Relator\n\nbe denied mandamus relief, her common law marriage claim would proceed to trial\n\nwithout permitting Relator opportunity for discovery of evidence necessary to prove\n\nup her claim or to make part of the appellate record. Therefore, Relator would not\n\nhave an adequate remedy by appellate review should she be denied mandamus relief\n\non her Motion to Compel Discovery responses from Plaintiffs Frances Sowell and\n\nCorey Johns. Ultimately, the denial of a reasonable opportunity to develop the merits\n\nof Relator’s case would result in a trial that would be a waste of judicial resources.\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n      Respondent’s abuse of discretion resulted in the denial of Relator’s Motion to\n\nCompel. Not one document or answers to Interrogatories requested in Relator’s\n\nMotion to Compel was ordered to be produced or ordered to be answered by\n\nPlaintiffs, despite the fact that Plaintiffs obviously failed to object, respond or\n\nanswer in a timely manner. The denial of Relator’s Motion to Compel is so arbitrary\n\n\n                                          17\n\fand unreasonable as to constitute a clear abuse of discretion, for which there is no\n\nadequate remedy by appeal.\n\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n\n       For all the reasons set forth above, Relator, Vicki Johns, respectfully requests\n\nthat this petition for writ of mandamus be filed and set for hearing or submission,\n\nand that this Court grant Relator’s petition for writ of mandamus, directing the trial\n\ncourt to withdraw the Order denying Relator’s Motion to Compel and to issue an\n\nOrder Compelling Plaintiffs Frances Sowell and Corey Johns to adequately respond\n\nand produce all documents and answer all interrogatories responsive to Relator’s\n\nRequest for Production, Interrogatories and Second Request for Production. . Relator\n\nrespectfully requests all further relief, both at law and in equity, to which Relator is\n\njustly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f                                              Respectfully submitted\n\n\n                                              BY: _/s/ George K.

WYNNE:    Rusty Hardin is also on behalf of\n\n19   the Plaintiffs as well, Your Honor.\n\n20                  THE COURT:    Okay.   So we have a Motion to Compel\n\n21   Discovery Responses.\n\n22                  MR. WYNNE:    I figure it makes some sense that\n\n23   since the last time we have been here there has been some\n\n24   progress made and some of the issues have been narrowed down\n\n25   and the immediate thing we are here for is two motions, so if\n\f                                                                       4\n\n\n\n 1   you don't mind, I would like to give you a little bit of where\n\n 2   we are in the case.\n\n 3                    So, as you know, Brian Johns died as a result of\n\n 4   an industrial accident back in August of 2012 and that led to a\n\n 5   lawsuit against his employer and the other owners-operators of\n\n 6   the industrial facility down in Deer Park.   In addition to the\n\n 7   three parties that I represent, the Estate, Brian's mother and\n\n 8   brother's adult son, Brian's ex-wife filed a claim against the\n\n 9   Defendants and Brian's father filed a claim.     All the claimants\n\n10   have settled all the claims against the Defendants and we are\n\n11   just waiting to paper up some documents on that and so really\n\n12   the only issue -- live issue that's left for the Court or left\n\n13   for a jury trial or any resolution is the issue of the\n\n14   allocation of the settlement proceeds between the five\n\n15   beneficiaries and then, two, whether the ex-wife is, as she\n\n16   purports to be, the common-law marriage of Brian at the time of\n\n17   his death.   And that's really the two issues and what we have\n\n18   narrowed down.   And I expect sooner rather than later all that\n\n19   paperwork will be done and we will back in front of the Court\n\n20   to get an approval in the heirship proceeding.\n\n21                    As far as the two motions today, one of which\n\n22   applies to Ms. Bobbie Young, who is an attorney, what we have\n\n23   discovered through the course of this lawsuit is that the\n\n24   ex-wife at the time before -- maybe a year or so before Brian's\n\n25   death to about six or seven or eight months after Brian's death\n\f                                                                       5\n\n\n\n 1   had a separate adoption proceeding and a separate intervention\n\n 2   proceeding in a parental termination case in this Court, not in\n\n 3   Probate One but in Harris County.   In that case, she legally\n\n 4   took the exact opposite position, under oath, that she takes in\n\n 5   this lawsuit.   There she says, and you have to say this is a\n\n 6   matter of law, that I'm not married, I don't live with Brian\n\n 7   Johns, and I have no agreement with him to be married, and, in\n\n 8   fact, this child that I'm seeking to adopt in no way, shape or\n\n 9   form lives or has any connection to Brian Johns.   Now, four\n\n10   years later when there is money on the table, the ex-wife takes\n\n11   the exact opposite position, and not just with respect to\n\n12   herself, but with respect to the child who is not even actually\n\n13   adopted until seven months after Brian died.   And so one of the\n\n14   things that we are trying to do in proving that up for a\n\n15   summary judgment on judicial estoppel, because frankly, Judge,\n\n16   you can't swear under oath on Monday that the sky is blue and\n\n17   then swear under oath on Tuesday that the sky is red and get\n\n18   away with it.   So what we want to do is prove up the lies in a\n\n19   court of law.   Part that have is, we want the discovery record\n\n20   where Ms. Johns swears under oath to these facts so that we can\n\n21   come in here and prove them up, show them to the Court, and\n\n22   hopefully get this case resolved sooner rather than later so we\n\n23   don't have to spend too much more time in the jury trial.   So\n\n24   that's the basis of the motion against Ms. Young to get those\n\n25   records and the relevance of it.\n\f                                                                        6\n\n\n\n 1                   At the same time, the ex-wife has filed a Motion\n\n 2   to Compel against my clients.   And basically what she is\n\n 3   seeking is, this isn't one of those fishing expeditions, this\n\n 4   one of those let's dredge the lake and just see what we can\n\n 5   find.   For instance, there is a couple of things I understand\n\n 6   that we are really in dispute about.   The first one is she\n\n 7   wants the employment records from Brian's mother.    From a\n\n 8   substantive standpoint, I'm not sure what Brian's employment\n\n 9   records have to do with whether Vickie was married to Brian,\n\n10   whether they held themselves out, whether they lived together.\n\n11   And to make matters even more drastic, Judge, Francis Sowell is\n\n12   70-something years old, I don't think she has worked since\n\n13   1996, which is twenty years before Brian died, so I don't see\n\n14   how that is any way possibly relevant to this case.    Then they\n\n15   asked for Cory, the son's college education records.   Again,\n\n16   I'm not sure what a 25-year-olds college transcripts and\n\n17   college education records have anything to do with whether this\n\n18   woman lived with Brian, agreed to be married or held their self\n\n19   out to be married.   And then the last category of documents\n\n20   that are really at issue is the ex-wife says, I want every\n\n21   piece of correspondence between Brian and his son, between\n\n22   Brian and his mom, and between Brian's mom and son, for the\n\n23   entire course of their life in regards to -- with no limitation\n\n24   on subject matter.   Just by their very nature those requests\n\n25   are simply overbroad, Judge.    And I have a 2003 case from the\n\f                                                                          7\n\n\n\n 1   Texas Supreme Court that says that right on point.    And so what\n\n 2   we are asking, Judge, is we would like you to deny Ms. Young's\n\n 3   Motion to Quash, allow us -- and give a signed order that\n\n 4   provides her coverage under the law, allows us to get the\n\n 5   documents that I think are going to dispose of this case\n\n 6   finally in a very neat fashion, and then I would ask that you\n\n 7   would deny their Motion to Compel because educational records,\n\n 8   employment records, and every piece of correspondence between\n\n 9   people over the course of forty years simply isn't relevant to\n\n10   were they married, did they live together, and that they held\n\n11   themselves out to be married.    So that's the position.    And I\n\n12   will turn it over to opposing counsel.\n\n13                   THE COURT:   All right, thank you.\n\n14                   MS. YOUNG:   Judge, I am Bobbie Young.     I'm the\n\n15   attorney who was attorney ad litem for the child that was\n\n16   adopted in that CPS case.    I filed a motion requesting that the\n\n17   subpoena be quashed and not have to turn those records over\n\n18   under Texas Family Code Section 251.201 they are confidential.\n\n19   I can't turn them over without a court order.\n\n20                   And aside from that, I'm also asking for\n\n21   attorney's fees, the cost of my drafting this motion and being\n\n22   here today.   And I do have an order for however the Judge\n\n23   decides.\n\n24                   THE COURT:   Okay.   So you filed your Motion to\n\n25   Quash Subpoena and you attached an order.    Is that -- do you\n\f                                                                       8\n\n\n\n 1   have something different than what was attached for me to deal\n\n 2   with?\n\n 3                  MS. YOUNG:   No, Your Honor.    If the Order on\n\n 4   Motion to Quash is there, then that's the Order that I would\n\n 5   ask you to review.\n\n 6                  THE COURT:   Okay.    Well, I guess you would agree\n\n 7   that if I -- I guess perhaps if I quash the subpoena, you might\n\n 8   be entitled to your fees.   But if I order the records turned\n\n 9   over, then you probably wouldn't be.    I mean, you just you\n\n10   brought this to the Court's attention because of the statute\n\n11   that requires you to not release those kind of documents except\n\n12   without a court order or without a court order?\n\n13                  MS. YOUNG:   Your Honor, I brought it to the\n\n14   Court's attention for that reason.    But because I'm a solo\n\n15   practitioner and I had to take time out to file this motion, it\n\n16   would be my obligation to file this motion, I understand\n\n17   that --\n\n18                  THE COURT:   That's true, I understand.\n\n19                  MS. YOUNG:   It is taking time away from me as an\n\n20   attorney to have to deal with this.    I couldn't negotiate\n\n21   without --\n\n22                  THE COURT:   And so what would you say -- did you\n\n23   include anything about your fees?\n\n24                  MS. YOUNG:   I did not, Your Honor.   But if the\n\n25   Court would like to hear some testimony from me, I would do so.\n\f                                                                            9\n\n\n\n 1   I think it took me about a couple of hours to talk to everybody\n\n 2   involved, including the court where the orders were entered\n\n 3   with regard to the adoption and to the county attorney and\n\n 4   through my own separate research, because I want to be\n\n 5   cooperative with the Court and with counsel but I have to do it\n\n 6   under the law.   So it did take me at least two hours to do\n\n 7   that.   My hourly rate is $300 per hour.\n\n 8                    MR. HARDIN:   Your Honor, if the Court issues the\n\n 9   subpoena, we would agree to pay the attorney's fees, as I\n\n10   understand it, is $600, and that might take that issue off the\n\n11   Court's table.\n\n12                    THE COURT:    Okay.    And do you, for your side of\n\n13   it, do you have a proposed order?\n\n14                    MR. WYNNE:    We do.    It's basic as it can be,\n\n15   saying the Motion to Quash is denied.       Part of the problem is\n\n16   like, before we got here, Judge, we actually had this phone\n\n17   call where we said we would agree to pay.       We modified the\n\n18   subpoena to comply with the requests to switch it to the\n\n19   discovery file as opposed to the whole file, so the thought\n\n20   that, hey, Ms. Young has to come down because of something that\n\n21   we did and we weren't compliant, I mean --\n\n22                    MS. YOUNG:    I didn't mean to imply that.\n\n23                    THE COURT:    No, I understand.    I think it's, to\n\n24   me, it's just the normal process of trying to get this issue\n\n25   before the Court.\n\f                                                                        10\n\n\n\n 1                   MS. YOUNG:    Right.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:    I don't view it in any other way.     I\n\n 3   think everybody is doing their job in other words.\n\n 4                   MS. YOUNG:    That's all.\n\n 5                   THE COURT:    So, if you do have a proposed order,\n\n 6   I can either work off of --\n\n 7                   MR. WYNNE:    Judge, I know she had the proposed\n\n 8   order.   I think it just basically gives you the option of being\n\n 9   sustained or denied, granted or denied.\n\n10                   THE COURT:    Right.\n\n11                   MR. WYNNE:    What I would suggest is, we just\n\n12   circle -- if you are going to deny the Motion to Quash, have\n\n13   her turn over the documents with the understanding of the\n\n14   agreement on the record that we will pay the $600 for it, I\n\n15   think we can just circle \"denied\" and \"denied\", and have it\n\n16   signed today to get this going.\n\n17                   THE COURT:    Well, I will make the decision right\n\n18   after I go off the bench.    I will look at it.   I don't think I\n\n19   need until tomorrow.   But I will look at it and make sure I\n\n20   understand everything about the relief requested and both\n\n21   parties will know something by four PM.\n\n22                   MS. YOUNG:    And Your Honor, if I'm ordered to\n\n23   turn the documents over, if I could have a time certain in\n\n24   which to do that, and also, I have a case across the street\n\n25   that they are waiting for me on.\n\f                                                                         11\n\n\n\n 1                     THE COURT:    I will do that.   And you can be\n\n 2   excused and I will give you a time certain.       Any thoughts on\n\n 3   the timing of it if I agree with you?\n\n 4                     MR. WYNNE:    It depends on how voluminous it is,\n\n 5   so if it's not much --\n\n 6                     THE COURT:    By the way, is there a further\n\n 7   response to all of this?\n\n 8                     MR. FARAH:    We are on the Motion to Compel, Your\n\n 9   Honor.   Plus, we weren't even put on notice of this motion.\n\n10                     MS. YOUNG:    I didn't know about them at all.\n\n11                     MR. FARAH:    This is the first time we are\n\n12   hearing about all of this right now.\n\n13                     THE COURT:    So nobody else wants to speak up\n\n14   about the issue that we are talking about right now?\n\n15                     MR. OSTROM:   Well, the problem is, Your Honor,\n\n16   we don't know if those records have any relation to Ms. Johns.\n\n17   And to the extent there is something we need to assert, we have\n\n18   not seen those.\n\n19                     THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n20                     MR. OSTROM:   So right now we are left with this\n\n21   subpoena to compel that we have not been afforded notice of and\n\n22   so we really don't know what the next step is going to be after\n\n23   these documents are produced.      Apparently, they want to use\n\n24   them for a summary judgment.      Maybe we have an objection to\n\n25   them, maybe we don't.    We don't know right now.\n\f                                                                         12\n\n\n\n 1                    MR. WYNNE:    Judge, here is the problem with\n\n 2   that, I mean, your client's discovery response is that you have\n\n 3   an obligation to produce and you haven't, so we are having to\n\n 4   subpoena third parties to get them.     So if you will simply tell\n\n 5   your clients ex-lawyer who has the right to the file to turn\n\n 6   over the entire file, then there is no need to subpoena anyone,\n\n 7   because it's her works.   So it's a little -- sir, I'm a little\n\n 8   taken aback by the fact that --\n\n 9                    THE COURT:    Well, if I order the records turned\n\n10   over, I will instruct everybody to have a copy of what's been\n\n11   turned over.\n\n12                    MR. FARAH:    And Judge, we have tried to get\n\n13   these records.\n\n14                    THE COURT:    Whether or not you should have a\n\n15   copy or not, I will order that turned over so everybody is on\n\n16   the same page about what's out there.\n\n17                    MR. OSTROM:   Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n18                    MS. YOUNG:    May I be excused?\n\n19                    THE COURT:    Yes, you may.   So what do we have\n\n20   left, your Motion to Compel?\n\n21                    MR. FARAH:    He kind of presented our Motion to\n\n22   Compel for us, Mr. Wynne did, but I would like to present it\n\n23   from our perspective.\n\n24                    THE COURT:    He is good at that, isn't he?   Takes\n\n25   the ball and just runs with it.\n\f                                                                        13\n\n\n\n 1                    MR. FARAH:   Sure.   But if you look at the Motion\n\n 2   to Compel, Mr. Wynne is going past the most important part of\n\n 3   our Motion to Compel.   We served them with discovery on January\n\n 4   28th, 2015.   The responses were due on February 28th, 2015.       We\n\n 5   didn't get the responses until June 5th, 2015.     So under the\n\n 6   Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, they waived all objections and\n\n 7   privileges because they didn't respond timely, so whatever\n\n 8   objections he has are not valid at this point.     And that's our\n\n 9   main position, Your Honor.\n\n10                    THE COURT:   But your theory is, parties get a\n\n11   divorce, and then somehow in that interim time before death\n\n12   there is a common-law marriage, right?\n\n13                    MR. FARAH:   They get divorced and that same day\n\n14   are common-law married until his death.     They go home together\n\n15   after --\n\n16                    THE COURT:   Okay.   Then so there is some, I\n\n17   don't know, buyer's remorse probably doesn't -- there is some\n\n18   remorse about it and that very day they somehow agreed to be\n\n19   married again?\n\n20                    MR. FARAH:   It's not remorse, they planned ahead\n\n21   of time because of the adoption process.\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Oh, there was some adoption process\n\n23   to this.   I guess all I'm saying is, all I'm trying to get at\n\n24   is, are you asking for records prior to the divorce?     Are all\n\n25   of these records post formal divorce?     I mean, I was thinking I\n\f                                                                      14\n\n\n\n 1   was nearing something that you were going back in time to point\n\n 2   to when it doesn't seem to be relevant to a common-law\n\n 3   marriage.\n\n 4                  MR. WYNNE:    So for Brian's mother who --\n\n 5                  THE COURT:    Hang on.    Go ahead and let him\n\n 6   finish.\n\n 7                  MR. WYNNE:    I was trying to explain.\n\n 8                  MR. FARAH:    I know he wants to do it all but,\n\n 9   let's go request by request, okay?      The educational records for\n\n10   Corey Johns, okay?    We are specifically -- we can make our\n\n11   request more specific and I discussed it with Bob before this\n\n12   hearing, we are specifically requesting information on an\n\n13   administrative hearing that he was part of at Southern\n\n14   University where he was kicked out of Southern University for a\n\n15   crime he allegedly committed and what we are trying to find is\n\n16   my client you wrote a letter on their clients' behalf, saying\n\n17   that she was the stepmother of this individual or Corey Johns,\n\n18   and that she would make sure that he would stay out of trouble\n\n19   and that they were living in her and Brian's Johns' home, and\n\n20   so an on and so on.    So that letter is post the divorce and\n\n21   very much relevant as to the elements of a common-law marriage.\n\n22   Because if there is this letter that she presented to the Court\n\n23   that says he is going to be living with me and his father in\n\n24   our home and I'm his stepmother, that's very much relevant to\n\n25   the common-law issue.    So I don't see why that would not be\n\f                                                                       15\n\n\n\n 1   discoverable.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:   All right.\n\n 3                   MR. FARAH:   Especially since they blew the\n\n 4   deadline to file their objections and to respond by four\n\n 5   months.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:   Well, I'm not saying it is or not.\n\n 7   I haven't decided.    I'm just trying to hash it out.\n\n 8                   MR. FARAH:   I know that.   I just wanted to\n\n 9   remind you of that.    And then we got -- so then we have got No.\n\n10   17, or sorry, No. 20, a signed copy of the authorization to\n\n11   obtain employment records for Francis Sowell who is the\n\n12   Administrator of the Estate.    Well, okay, in this case, there\n\n13   is testimony and evidence that Mrs. Sowell planted a password\n\n14   at the hospital so that certain people couldn't come in and out\n\n15   of the hospital to visit Brian.    Well, my client said that she\n\n16   tried to go visit her husband.    But because she didn't have --\n\n17   they didn't give her the password, she could not get past the\n\n18   desk to go see her husband and talk with him and meet with him.\n\n19   And we are trying to establish, which we have a reason to\n\n20   believe, that she has strong relationship at that hospital that\n\n21   gave her that power to exclude Vickie from seeing her husband\n\n22   while he is on his death bed.    And that's very much relevant\n\n23   because at trial they are going to argue that she didn't even\n\n24   come and try to see her husband at the hospital while he is\n\n25   being treated for these serious burns, which is absolutely\n\f                                                                       16\n\n\n\n 1   untruthful and we think those records are relevant as to Mrs.\n\n 2   Francis Sowell's credibility.    I mean, in her deposition, 26\n\n 3   pages to try and identify her work history, she was avoiding\n\n 4   every question.    She would not give me the information to\n\n 5   straightforward questions like, where did you work?     Give me\n\n 6   all the hospitals you worked at as a nurse.    What capacity did\n\n 7   you work?   And she was completely evasive.   So we reason to\n\n 8   believe that she is not being cooperative and hiding something\n\n 9   that we think is relevant in this case.    And that was No. 20,\n\n10   Your Honor, Request No. 20, which is in the Motion to Compel.\n\n11                     And then we have Request 22 through 26.   And we\n\n12   can narrow this down.    We did ask for broad requests but we can\n\n13   narrow it down from the period of time that Vickie and Brian\n\n14   first got married in 2007 until his death in 2012, a five-year\n\n15   period, of e-mails between the family members and these\n\n16   requests.   And I will tell you why that's important.    Brian and\n\n17   Vickie were legally married for three years and in those three\n\n18   years there was complete resentment and hatred towards Vickie\n\n19   from the family while they were legally married.    So from the\n\n20   beginning, she was not welcome in the Johns family.     And she\n\n21   had to fight and fight and fight to show that she was part of\n\n22   this family.   And there is an e-mail that she wrote to the\n\n23   family asking them to stay out of her and Brian's relationship,\n\n24   to let them live their lives and be peaceful and happy and move\n\n25   on with their lives.    That was the only e-mail produced by the\n\f                                                                         17\n\n\n\n 1   Plaintiffs in this case.      We believe that there was e-mails\n\n 2   going back and forth between the family members after receiving\n\n 3   this e-mail.   And other e-mails that will show that Brian and\n\n 4   Vickie were married or that they didn't know Brian and Vickie\n\n 5   were divorced.   And we think that's relevant to some of the\n\n 6   elements to establish a common-law marriage.\n\n 7                    So, you know, we can narrow the scope.      Instead\n\n 8   of any and all for infinity, from 2007 to 2012, I have no\n\n 9   problem doing that.   And that's it, Your Honor.      That's all we\n\n10   got.\n\n11                    THE COURT:    Anybody else?\n\n12                    MR. WYNNE:    May I calmly respond, Judge?\n\n13                    THE COURT:    Sure.   I have never seen you any\n\n14   other way.\n\n15                    MR. WYNNE:    I appreciate that.\n\n16                    THE COURT:    I don't know if that's true, but go\n\n17   ahead.\n\n18                    MR. WYNNE:    What I would like to do is address a\n\n19   little bit of each of these things, because I just don't agree\n\n20   with many of the things that were just said.        The education\n\n21   records Mr. Farah referenced an administrative proceeding at\n\n22   Corey's school, there is nothing in this entire record that\n\n23   supports that statement.      In fact, in Ms. John's deposition we\n\n24   asked her about it and the only thing she said was that after\n\n25   Corey got into trouble at school I went with Brian to pick him\n\f                                                                        18\n\n\n\n 1   up.   Well, guess what?   Corey has been deposed twice in this\n\n 2   case and he said the exact same thing.     In fact, I have the\n\n 3   deposition and I can show you that everything matches and there\n\n 4   is not a single shred of testimony about some letter.    And\n\n 5   truthfully, if there was a letter, how come no one can tell us\n\n 6   who it was sent to, when it was sent, you know, why doesn't she\n\n 7   have a copy of this if it was from 2010 or 2011?    She has no\n\n 8   information about this letter except what her counsel says now.\n\n 9   So what we are going to do, what they are proposing is, Judge,\n\n10   this young man has protected federal rights under FERPA to\n\n11   these educational records.    This woman who has got a claim for\n\n12   money, her lawyer says that there is a letter, so now, Judge,\n\n13   issue a subpoena directed by the State of Texas to an\n\n14   institution in the State of Louisiana that's protected by\n\n15   federal FERPA law so we can get what?    A letter that no one has\n\n16   any details about.    So I would say that that goes straight to\n\n17   the heart of a fishing expedition.\n\n18                     The employment records of Mrs. Sowell, again,\n\n19   she has been deposed twice in this case.    She was asked these\n\n20   exact questions.    In her deposition, I have that right here,\n\n21   Judge, I will show it to you as well, she was asked, \"Did you\n\n22   know anyone at the hospital before Brian got there when he was\n\n23   injured?   No.\"   What she testified is that she worked with a\n\n24   famous burn doctor, Dennis Blocker, down in Galveston, in the\n\n25   late 70's and 80's.    That's it.   That's her connection.   Oh,\n\f                                                                        19\n\n\n\n 1   and by the way, Dr. Blocker, he died in 1984, and the hospital\n\n 2   she worked at shut down in 1996.   So again, like this secret\n\n 3   password, she was asked about all that in deposition.      She said\n\n 4   the hospital gave her a password and she gave it to her kids\n\n 5   because that's who she needed to give it to.    I'm not sure this\n\n 6   nefarious plot to keep someone out is coming from, but in any\n\n 7   event, there is just simply no relevance to those.\n\n 8                   And then in the correspondence, there is only\n\n 9   one piece of correspondence that our client has that in any way\n\n10   came from Ms. John's, Vickie Johns, or that references her.        We\n\n11   produced it.   In their deposition they were asked, it seems\n\n12   Vickie had no presence at all in this family, and Corey Francis\n\n13   says, yeah, that's right, she didn't, we just didn't even know\n\n14   she existed.   And what is most important is, it's funny because\n\n15   Vickie Johns, the ex-wife, hasn't produced a single piece of\n\n16   correspondence between the family.   I mean, she has not\n\n17   produced a single e-mail between her and her purported husband\n\n18   over the course of three years.    Not a single letter.    Not a\n\n19   single phone call.   Not a single text.   Nothing.   And so what\n\n20   she is trying to do is say, well, I can't find anything even\n\n21   though I was married to him for four years so y'all must have\n\n22   something, so give me everything under the sun.      I mean, there\n\n23   is no time limitation.   There is no subject matter limitation.\n\n24   And frankly, when you look at the volume of stuff that we have\n\n25   produced, and we have given them seven authorizations, they\n\f                                                                      20\n\n\n\n 1   didn't even know what Brian's bank accounts were, his\n\n 2   employment records.   We identified it for them and signed\n\n 3   authorizations giving it to them.   The only the two\n\n 4   authorizations that we had a problem with were employment\n\n 5   records from 20 years ago and educational records from a young\n\n 6   man that had nothing to do with this case.\n\n 7                  And so, Judge, they talk about this waiver\n\n 8   argument, and so I want to address that on two bases.    We were\n\n 9   in here for the first six months of this year arguing about the\n\n10   Plea to the Jurisdiction and our Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n11   They had asked for discovery during that same time period and I\n\n12   had told them that we were not putting anyone up for\n\n13   depositions or producing discovery until that is ruled on.\n\n14   When that was ruled on, we immediately produced all our\n\n15   documents and we turned over our stuff, and so under that\n\n16   waiver there is a clear exception for a great cost.     I think if\n\n17   there is ever a case for that, it's this one.\n\n18                  And then secondly, if you will notice, I believe\n\n19   that the exhibits, the discovery exhibits filed by his ex-wife\n\n20   are not signed in the record.   Under Rule 191.3, the Court\n\n21   cannot enforce an unsigned discovery piece of evidence.     So\n\n22   whatever it is, it's unenforceable at this point.   And so there\n\n23   is a ton of grounds to simply deny this.   And it is not as if\n\n24   they haven't deposed the people or gotten the documents that\n\n25   really are relevant, cellular phone records, bank accounts,\n\f                                                                           21\n\n\n\n 1   things that would show what the nature of the relationship was.\n\n 2   So at that point, Judge, I will pass.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:    All right.\n\n 4                     MR. FARAH:    Judge, just because there are\n\n 5   pending motions doesn't give him the unilateral right to hold\n\n 6   off on actual discovery.       Okay?   He could have asked for a Rule\n\n 7   11 Agreement.     There is several ways you can handle that.     He\n\n 8   can't just say, look, let's wait until after these motions are\n\n 9   heard and we get a ruling and then we will answer your\n\n10   discovery that we sent you four or five months ago.        It doesn't\n\n11   work like that.\n\n12                     Second, these authorizations he was talking\n\n13   about, we just got these authorizations four weeks ago, because\n\n14   we have to call them and e-mail them and ask them for these\n\n15   authorizations over and over and over again, and finally they\n\n16   decided, all right, we will send you these authorizations a few\n\n17   weeks before this Motion to Compel here.        This was nine months\n\n18   after we sent out the Request for Production for these\n\n19   authorizations.    And now they are trying to make it seem like\n\n20   they have been willing advocates in this case, producing\n\n21   documents.   They have been contesting this thing since January.\n\n22   These were due in February and now we are in September.         He\n\n23   can't unilaterally state we are not going to ask for these\n\n24   until after the motion, after our motions are ruled on.\n\n25                     On some of those other points, we are not asking\n\f                                                                        22\n\n\n\n 1   for subpoena.   Why not give us an authorization and we will\n\n 2   look at the records from the hospital, the son's records from\n\n 3   the hospital?   And give us an authorization and we will go get\n\n 4   the administrative records from the administrative hearing at\n\n 5   Southern University in Baton Rouge.   We have a right to\n\n 6   discovery to prove up our case.   It's our burden of proof and\n\n 7   we can't prove up our case without evidence, and they are\n\n 8   preventing us from us getting that very evidence.    And that's\n\n 9   all we are asking, Judge.    We are just asking for the\n\n10   opportunity to get the evidence to prove our case.    I pass.\n\n11                   THE COURT:   All right.   I will just look at it\n\n12   and probably come up with a definitive response by tomorrow\n\n13   afternoon.\n\n14                   MR. WYNNE:   Judge, what I would like to do is I\n\n15   would like to hand you copies of Corey Johns' deposition where\n\n16   it's marked where he is talking about the educational\n\n17   administrative incident in connection with Vickie showing up,\n\n18   Vickie Johns' deposition that corroborates one hundred percent\n\n19   Corey's deposition, and then also Francis Sowell's deposition\n\n20   marked where it shows where she is talking about specifically\n\n21   saying, under oath, that I haven't been working since '96, and\n\n22   I didn't know anyone at this hospital at the time we got there,\n\n23   and talking about how she got the password and what she did\n\n24   with it, which I think almost conclusively rebuts a lot of\n\n25   those arguments, Judge.\n\f                                                                         23\n\n\n\n 1                   THE COURT:    Do you care if I have that?   I have\n\n 2   already heard that but it's just part of what I'm going to look\n\n 3   at as I look through these requests and whether I ought to\n\n 4   grant the Motion to Compel in certain respects or all respects\n\n 5   or not.\n\n 6                   MR. OSTROM:    Your Honor, I think the only\n\n 7   concern I have about this is that we are taking the word of an\n\n 8   interested witness.   Those people are who we are going to\n\n 9   depose and, yeah, they may have deposed in their deposition or\n\n10   testify at trial, they may have deposed in their deposition we\n\n11   knew nothing about an administrative hearing, but it sure in\n\n12   the hell would be interesting that when we get those records\n\n13   that there was, in fact, an administrative hearing and he lied\n\n14   under oath.   The jury is going to hear about that --\n\n15                   MR. WYNNE:    Whoa, whoa, don't call my client a\n\n16   liar.\n\n17                   MR. OSTROM:    So that's the point.   They can say\n\n18   whatever they want to say.    But we have a right to verify that\n\n19   through third parties, through other institutions, through\n\n20   e-mails that they say, well, this was all about Johns.      Well,\n\n21   there may be an e-mail that doesn't mention, quote, Johns, or\n\n22   Vickie Johns, and it's just between son and mother complaining\n\n23   about the Decedent's choice of women.    You know, we are not --\n\n24   it's not incumbent upon us to figure out exactly the\n\n25   phraseology that's in there.    That's part of the discovery\n\f                                                                       24\n\n\n\n 1   process, so I'm not sure how this stuff is relevant to a\n\n 2   decision on whether, you know, this is something that's\n\n 3   discoverable or not.   I think the questions are in the scope.\n\n 4                   The other thing that wasn't mentioned is that,\n\n 5   you know, ultimately there will be a trial if the Court doesn't\n\n 6   grant some summary judgment one way or the other, ultimately,\n\n 7   there will be a trial about apportionment of damages that goes\n\n 8   to the relationship, the relationship all of these individuals\n\n 9   had with the Decedent and their relationship amongst each\n\n10   other.   And the jury is going to hear all that.    And I think\n\n11   this, the e-mails, and the -- and what they -- what she did for\n\n12   the family or didn't do for the family all becomes relevant at\n\n13   that stage.   So I think there is really kind of two parties.\n\n14   We are looking at the common-law spouse, but once you get past\n\n15   that, you are going to try a case on proportionment and\n\n16   relationship.   And all of that evidence is going to be\n\n17   contained in the same group of documents.\n\n18                   MR. HARDIN:   What authority do you have the\n\n19   authority to compel somebody to turn over federally FERPA\n\n20   protected material, because it's not about the issue of the\n\n21   subpoena over there or going that process, they want to take a\n\n22   shortcut and have you compel us to have a student's records\n\n23   turned over, and I'm not sure how they get there.\n\n24                   THE COURT:    Yeah, that's an interesting\n\n25   argument.   There have been other instances where, you know, a\n\f                                                                       25\n\n\n\n 1   state court judge is essentially being asked to potentially\n\n 2   violate what federal statutes would tell him or her.\n\n 3                  MR. HARDIN:   Right.   And so for that reason\n\n 4   also, we would ask the Court to deny it.   If they want to try\n\n 5   to get it, they could always go through to trying to subpoena\n\n 6   on a third party or so, something that, as Mr. Wynne has said\n\n 7   repeatedly, we can't find any evidence that it ever happened.\n\n 8   Part of the reason for all of these authorizations that we have\n\n 9   even given them for stuff that we don't even believe is\n\n10   discoverable was to try to keep our trial date, because they\n\n11   threatened to come in and ask for a continuance if we didn't\n\n12   sign these authorizations that allowed them to get this.\n\n13                  As you know, we were ready to go to trial in the\n\n14   fall of last year, back when Dow was still in it.   They have\n\n15   intervened and the Court, as I understand, granted it and my\n\n16   memory is the trial was moved to May.    Now we are in November\n\n17   and this family, this has been going on for quite awhile, and\n\n18   so we have been trying to do anything.   That's why I stand up\n\n19   and volunteered to pay her attorney's fees.    We are trying to\n\n20   do everything we can to make sure we hold that trial date for\n\n21   this family has been waiting a couple of years, and to ask this\n\n22   Court to compel us to violate -- to turn over federally\n\n23   protected material when there is absolutely no showing that is\n\n24   relevant to anything.   Keep in mind what he just said, that\n\n25   even if there had been such an administrative hearing, it had\n\f                                                                         26\n\n\n\n 1   nothing to do as to whether she was the common-law spouse.\n\n 2   They want to compel -- they want to know about a letter that\n\n 3   she wrote.    They haven't even shown how it would ever be\n\n 4   admissible.   A self-serving letter establishing one of the\n\n 5   party's legal position in the litigation is not admissible.\n\n 6   It's hearsay.    It's not an admission of a party opponent.    It\n\n 7   doesn't come in.   What they are asking you for is to compel us\n\n 8   to give up certain rights so they can go see if there is an\n\n 9   inadmissible letter that they can find.    There is no evidence\n\n10   that it even exists.   So we would respectfully ask -- he has\n\n11   given them on seven, I think, from nine authorizations.       We\n\n12   drew the line with this one and a woman that has not worked for\n\n13   twenty years.    They have absolutely no evidence from any\n\n14   source, forget that our client has denied it per se, but they\n\n15   have no evidence from any source that previous employment that\n\n16   ended some twenty years ago at a hospital that no longer exists\n\n17   is somehow relevant to her current claim that she resumed a\n\n18   common-law marriage after they dissolved the legal marriage.\n\n19                    At the end of the day, it's going to turn out to\n\n20   be a fraudulent claim that really subjects her to criminal\n\n21   prosecution, and so to have the trial delayed or us giving up\n\n22   certain FERPA protected rights in order to basically keep\n\n23   stretching out what is going to be determined a fraud on the\n\n24   Court.   If the Court remembers, you lingered very hard on it as\n\n25   did the magistrate on this issue there has already been a\n\f                                                                          27\n\n\n\n 1   determination in another court in another proceeding she was\n\n 2   not married.   There was no common-law marriage.      And we urge\n\n 3   that, obviously, that that was the law of the case and that was\n\n 4   it.   The Court decided to grant the Bill of Review and that's\n\n 5   how we are in this place to begin with.      So now a woman who has\n\n 6   been found not to be common-law married has now come up with\n\n 7   these different claims and as an attempt to prove it wants us\n\n 8   to give up federally protected rights and wants a state judge\n\n 9   to order us to give up those rights in another state.       With all\n\n10   that said and done, we respectfully ask to not be compelled to\n\n11   sign these authorizations.     We will have to figure out, all\n\n12   right, what do we do?   Do we give in on that or do we take that\n\n13   up on appeal and lose our trial setting?       That's the Hobson's\n\n14   choice that we have got.     And I guess what we could do is, we\n\n15   could refuse to comply with the order and you could find us in\n\n16   contempt and then that contempt would be the only thing we\n\n17   could appeal or we could look to a mandamus.       But in any of\n\n18   those situations we lose our trial setting.       And that's the\n\n19   most valuable thing to us right now.       So we would respectfully\n\n20   ask the Court to deny the motion.\n\n21                   THE COURT:    All right.\n\n22                   MR. FARAH:    Judge, the only one holding them\n\n23   back from this trial setting is themselves.       We sent this\n\n24   discovery back in January.     They should have responded in\n\n25   February and we could have resolved these but they keep holding\n\f                                                                        28\n\n\n\n 1   back.   All of these objections and privileges that they are\n\n 2   talking about are gone.     All they had to do was answer the\n\n 3   discovery in thirty days.     These are all gone.\n\n 4                   Second of all, Corey is a party to this\n\n 5   litigation.   As a party to this litigation, he has a\n\n 6   responsibility to hand over documents that are requested from\n\n 7   him in his prosecution of his claims and he can hand over an\n\n 8   affidavit or authorization to get his own records.       There is no\n\n 9   subpoena required.   He has the right to his own records.       If he\n\n10   signs the authorization, we can get those records.       This is not\n\n11   my first case where I had to get educational records for a\n\n12   student.   This is not a novel issue.      That's all I have to say.\n\n13   Thank you.\n\n14                   THE COURT:    All right, I will let y'all know\n\n15   something by tomorrow afternoon.     Anything further?\n\n16                   MR. WYNNE:    No.   Thank you.\n\n17                   MR. FARAH:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n18                   MR.

Most communication is ALWAYS\n     NEGATIVE ..... for our mother's, you have taught us the old saying (if you\n     don't have nothing good or nice to say,don't say nothing) Unfortunately\n     we have forgotten that along the way .Life is hard enough to get thru\n     from day to day but we have experienced so much drama from s·ome of\n     you,it has to stop, thats why w~ have chosen to stay to ourselves.The\n     majority of our famililes are women,and with the exception of one of my\n     sisters Kim, all of us women have been married or is married.You\n     personally know how it feel to have in-laws.You are one or have been\n     one.How does yourmother-in law,sis in law,brother in law,father in law\n     TREAT YOU,ACKNOWLEDGE YOU,RESPECT YOU (or lack thereof) Do. they .\n     constantly discuss in your presence your ex-,-girlfriends,wives or\n     boyfriends ? How many of you have done that to me & Brian.Have we EVER\n     brought up your ex's or your previous baby mama's or daddy's or even\n     your spouses ex baby mama's or daddy's - NO WE HAVEN'T BECAUSE WE\n     RESPECT EVERYONE & THEIR MARRIAGES.Give us a break.Brian & I are\n     together,happily, get over it and ACCEPT IT,IT \"AIN'T gonna change\"He &\n     I have definately kept in alot of things we have wanted to say to you\n     our family members on both sides for all the negative things some of you\n     have done and said to our faces & behind one of our backs,but we jointly\n     are here to tell you from now on regardless of who you are, your\n     behavior & disrespect is no longer acceptable.The most important thing\n\fis that we love each other,thats it, as our family that should be all\nyou care about,not petty things & conunents like \"we are up under each\nother too much or all the time• How ignorant is that? We like each\nother,we are extremely attracted to each other,we are in love,why does\nthat make some of you annoyed or is it JEALOUSY.If we choose to breathe\nfor one another,thats our buisness,it works for us,maybe if some of you\npay more attention to your own SPOUSE & and try some of our techniques\nyou will have a much better relationship & want to be around your spouse\nmore. We rarely hear from most of you except the o.ccassional email.\nforward,how about spending some quality time with us.Some of you make\nexcuses as to why you haven't come to visit but we are expected to come\nto you,thats a 2-way street.We are only surrounding ourselves with\npositive people (friends,family) we want to raise our children in such\nan atmosphere,give us that chance,stop telling us every step to make\naccording to you & your path,GOD DID not ordain you as his helper or\noverseer to his kingdom.We are intelligent adults & we want to share our\nlives with you ALL.Let us make our own decisions,and raise our children\nas WE see fit.To my family, always respect my husband,to love me is to\nlove & accept him .To Brian's family the absolute same thing.To love him\nis to respect & accept me.If anyone would like to address this letter\nwith us ,please feel free to call or come by anytime.Since we are all\nadults,I figured I didnt nave to put individual names to every\nstatement, as all of you read this letter you know what part pertains to\nyou as an individual .................

Johns on September 17, 2011 through a friend on facebook. We continued\nto date and in the month of October of 2011, we decided to make our relationship exclusive with each\nother, And as time passed I got to know his son Corey Johns, met his mother Mrs. Francis Sowell and\nother family members including his two dogs Max and Koi. I would spend my weekends at his home\n(3827 Saxon Hollow Court, Friendswood, TX 77546). Our relationship continued and we were talking\nabout our future together and moving into his home in the month of September 2012 when we\ncompleted a year in our relationship. Then that tragic day in July of 2012, when I received a phone call\nfrom his sister Pam Jahns-Roberson telling me that Brian was in a terrible accident at work and that he\nwas in the ICU at UTMB Hospital in Galveston. That phone call changed my life forever. My 11 months\nwith Brian were amazing and I was privileged to have been able to spend and enjoy the last 11 months\nof Brian's life with him.\n\fOl/2~/2015 ~HO l~l         38     ~AX                                                                                        l?JOH/033     f\n                                                                                                                                         • I\n                                                                                                                                           !\n\n\n             HI.PAAAUTHOIUZATION TO DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION\n\n TO:\n           Physichln, Provide1· Ol' Fitcilay Numc:\n          Street Aclclr<~Ss:\n          CUy, State, 7.1p;\n          Plwne Numhl.ll':\n\n l'ATillNT:\n\n          Puticnt Name;                                                 Briun B.
