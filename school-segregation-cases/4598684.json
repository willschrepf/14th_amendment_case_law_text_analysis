Therefore,\nyou will pardon the necessary length of this opinion:\n            TEXAS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIOEF,\n     Under the Texas Constitution, public education is a\ndivision or department of the government, in the conduct\nof which the Legislature has all legislative power not de-\nnied it by the Constitution. (Mumme, et al vs. Marrs Tex-\nas Supreme Court, opinion by Judge Cureton, 40 S. W. (2d)\n31). Section 1 of Article VII, of the Constitution of Tex-\nas, reads as follows:\n         \"A general diffusion of knowledge being\n         essential to the preservation oftthe lib-\n         erties and rights of the people, it shall\n         be the duty of the Legislature of the\n         State to establish and make suitable pro-\n         vision for the support and maintenance of\n         an efficient system of public fxee schools.\"\n     Section 40 of Article III of the Texas Constitution em-\npowers the Legislature \"to levy taxes or impose burdens upon\nthe people\" to raise revenue for many purposes, among them\nthe following:\n         \"The support of public schools, in which\n         shall be included colleges ja& universi-\n         ties established b the State; . . .'I\n         7â€˜i7Xerscoringours7\n     From the above it is clear that the Legislature of\nTexas has the power to provide for the establishment and\n\fbn. George Xoffett - Psge 3\n\n\noperation of a negro university as contemplated by Senate\nSill 140,,unless there is some other constitutional pro-\nvision which prohibits such action or directs that it be ac-\ncoalished in a different manner. That brings us to an ex-\namination of Section 14 of Article VII, of the Constitution\nzf Texas, the only other constitutional provision relating\niiirectlyto this question. It reads as follows:\n           \"Sec. 14. Branch University for\n           Colored.--The Legislature shall also\n           when deemed practicable, establish\n           and provide for the maintenance of a\n           College or Branch University for the\n           instruction of the colored youths of\n           the State, to be located by a vote of\n           the people; Provided, that no tax\n           shall be levied, and no money appro-\n           priated, out of the general revenue,\n           either for this purpose or for the\n           establishment, and erection of the\n           buildings of the University of Texas.\"\n     Immediately we are faced with the question of whether the\nUniversity contemplated by Senate Bill 140 is the same as.that\noontemplated by the u;ritersof the above Section of the Con-\nstitution in 1876. Is it to be a College (integral part of a\nuniversity) or a Branch of the University of Texas? Does the\nLe.+lature by this Bill \"deem it practicable\" to provide for\nthe establishment and maintenance of such College or Branch\nout of the available fund accruing from the Permanent Univer-\nsity Fund and without aid of taxes and appropriations from the\nGeneral Revenue as would be required by the above section of\nthe Constitution? We think the answer is *no**to both of these\nquestions. It is clear from a reading of Senate Bill 140 that\nthe proposed negro university is not to be a Cqllege or Branch\nof The University of Texas. Its passage would evidence no in-\ndication that the Legislature \"deems it practicable\" to estab-\nlish and maintain such University under the limitation as to\nuse of taxes and general revenue for such purpose. On the\ncontrary, passage of Senate Bill 140 would indicate that an\nentirely separate university for negroes is to be established\nfree and independent of The University of Texas with full right\nto establishment, maintenance and erection of buildinas out of\nthe General Revenue Fund of the State.\n     This conclusion forces the question of whether the Legis-\nlature having been authorized when \"deemed practicable\" to\nestablish a negro university in the manner set out in Section\n14 of Article VII of the Constitution, can lawfully adopt a\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 4\n\n\ndifferent method and establish a different school out of other\nState funds. In other words, does the above section of our\nConstitution limit the manner of establishin? a nerro school\nof hither leominT to the procedure and fund~sprovided there-\nin? If so, the statutory school proposer!in Senate Bill 140\nis unconstitutional, and the only means of creating a negro\nuniversity in Texas is to establish it as a College or Branch\nof The University of Texas without appropriations from the\ngeneral revenue, and its location nust be in Austin, the city\nchosen for such college or branch by a vote of the people in\n1882. If not, Senate Bill 140 is constitutional, and the ne-\ngro university may be established out of general revenue and\nat any location desired by the Legislature.\n     We are familiar with the rule of law that a constitu-\ntional provision as to how a thing shall be done cotititutes\nan implied prohibition of its being done in.any other manner.\nHowever, when the constitutional provision is not mandatory\nbut leaves discretion with the Legislature as to when, if\nand how a thing is to be done, it should never be construed\nas a limitation by implication on the general power of the\nLegislature to accomplish the desired end in another manner.\nEspecially is this true in the present case where another\nconstitutional provision (Section 48, Article III) written\nin the same Convention; expressly recognizes the power of\nthe Legislature to establish and operate other colleges and\nuniversities in another manner.\n     Constitutional provisions, like statutes, are properly\nto be interpreted in the light of conditions existing at the\ntime of their adoption, the general spirit of the times and\nthe prevailing sentiments of the people. (Rumme vs. Marrs,\nsupra) The universal rule of construction is that legisla-\ntive and executive interpretations of the organic law, ac-\nquiesced in and long continued are of great weight in deter-\nmining the validity of any Act; and in case of ambiguity or\ndoubt will be followed by the courts. 9 Tex. Jur. 439, 6 R.\nC. L. 62, Mumme vs. Marrs, supra. To understand the inten-\ntion of the writers of the Texas Constitution and the legis-\nlative and executive interpretations of the question since\n1876, it is necessary that we review the history of the edu-\ncational articles of the Texas Constitution.\n\fHon.

George Moffett - Page 7\n\n\n       The message of Governor 0. M6. Roberts to the Legislature,\n  ,pril 6, 1882, discloses that instead of erecting buildings\n  for this institution, the land and buildings of Alta Vista,\n       Xempstead, were purchased and a school organized. The\n  ::e:'r\n  .._\n  :n-ispristion\n    ,           for this institution came out of the General\n  .?evenueand not out of The University Funds.

For in the same\n  section providing for that branch (Sec. 14) it is expressly\n  orovidej that its location shall be determined by a vote of the\n  ?eocle, and that 'no tax shall be levied and no money appro-\n  yriated out of the General Revenue for this purpose', which\n  :sulE hardly have escaped the attention of the Legislature if\n  ?hey had intended by this Act to establish the 'college or\n  jranch university'.\"\n       The 16th Legislature (ch. 59, p. 181; 1879) provided for\n  '1normal school at Prairie View (fomnerlv called Alta Vista)\n  -?ndattempted to appropriate from the University Fund $S,OOO.OO\n\\ \"or its support. Prior to 1882 there were other appropriations\n  :?3?eto the Prairie View School out of the available University\n  Yund and other indications that certain officials believed this\n  ?:3be the Colored Branch contemplated by Section 14 of Article\n  VII.\n       Pursuant to the Constitutional mandate, the Legislature\n  in .1881 passed an Act creating The University of Texas and pro-\n  vided for a vote of the people to fix its location. The elec-\n  tion was held and the proposal to separate the main university\n  from the Medical Department prevailed, Austin being chosen\n  for the former and Galveston for the latter.\n       In 1882 the Legislature recognized that the Prairie View\n  Normal was not the colored branch of the University mentioned\n  in the Constitution, and an election was ordered for the first\n  Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1882, to locate\n  this branch. (Acts 1882, ch. 19, p. 25). The contesting pla-\n  ces were Austin, Prairie View, Houston, Palestine, Paris, Bren-\n  ham, Pittsburg and Georgetown. Austin was again successful.\n  Governor Roberts in his message to the 18th Legislature, de-\n  livered January 10, 1883, said \"all branches of The State Uni-\n  versity have now been located; the main branch at Austin; the\n  'uiedical\n          Department at Galveston; the Agricultural and Mechani-\n  cal College at Bryan; and at the late General Election, the\n  branch university for colored youths at Austin.\"\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 8\n\n\n      At-the Regular Session of the 18th Legislature in 1883, an\n Act was passed to \"provide for the permanent endowment, in lands\n or,its proceeds, of The University of Texas and its branches,\n including the branch for the instruction of colored youths.\"\n (Acts 18th Leg., oh. 72, p. 71). This act set aside one mil-\n'lion.acres for an additional endowment of The University and\n its branches. The branch for colored youths was expressly in-\n cluded.\n     Between 1883 and 1897 no legislation pertaining to a negro\ncollege or branch of The University of Texas was passed, althougl\nseveral bills were proposed. In 1897 the Legislature set aside\none hundred thousand acres of.the public domain to be used for\nthe endowment of the colored branch'~(26thLeg., 1897, ch. 109,\np. 148), but later it was held that the public domain was ex-\nhausted (92 Tex. 58) and this endowment was â€˜never consummated.\n     In 1931 Article 2592 was enacted, which provided, among\nother things, that after September 1, 1934, the Available Uni-\nversity Fund, derived as revenue from the Permanent Fund of one\nmillion acres of land provided for in the Constitution and the\nadditional one million acres of land provided for in the Sta-\ntute of 1083, should be allocated to The University of Texas\nand the Agricultural and Mechanical College in the proportions\nof two-thirds and one-third, respectively.\n     The 49th Legislature in 1945 enacted Article 2643a which\nchanged the name of Prairie View State Normal and Industrial\nCollege to \"Prairie View University.\" The Act further provided\nthat \"whenever there is any demand for same, the Board of Direc-\ntors of the Agricultural and Mechanical College, in addition to\nthe courses of study now authorized for said institution is au-\nthorized to provide for,the establishment of â€˜-courses in law,\nmedicine, engineering, pharmacy, journalism, or any other gen-\nerally recognized college course taught at the University of Tex-\nas, in said Prairie View University, which courses shall be sub-\nstantially equivalent to those offered at the ,University,of\nTexas.\n     When two additional'statutory schools (West Texas A. & M.\nCollege and North Texas Agricultural College) were proposed in\n1917, Attorney General B. F. Looney was asked for an opinion on\nthe constitutionality of their establishment at places other\nthan Austin or Bryan. The problem involved the same question\nOf whether the Legislature had the power to-establish inatitu-\ntions of higher learning in any other manner than as provided\nin Article VII of the Constitution. In an able opinion written\nby Luther Nickels, who later served as a Commissioner to the\nTexas Supreme Court,,it was held that the Legislature was au-\nthorized under Seotion 48 of Article III, supra, to establish\n\f                                                               .I\n\n\nRon. George Moffett - Page 9\n\n\nother colleges and universities and support them out of the\ngeneral revenue.\n     Judge Nickels pointed out that such statutory universi-\nties would not be branches of The University of Texas within\nthe meaning of Article VII. A portion of this opinion is as\nfollows:\n           YSection 48 of Article 3 of the Consti-\n           tution empowers the Legislature 'to levy\n           taxes or impose burdens upon the people,'\n           to raise revenue for the economical ad-\n           ministration of the government in which\n           may be included the following purposes:\n           \"t . . . The support of public schools,\n           in which shall be included colleges and\n           universities established by the State;\n           . . .,\n           \". . . The language is that the Legisla-\n           ture may prov1d.efor 'colleges and uni-\n           versities,' -- both terms being in the\n           plural. This general language, undoubted-,\n           lv. includes the 'Universitv of Texas' and\n           the 'Agricultural and Mechanical College'\n           established by the Act of April 17, 1871,\n           but it also includes such other 'colleges\n           and universities as may be established by the\n           State'. The term 'established by the\n           State' is both prospective and retrospec-\n           tive in meaning; this must be true, be-\n           cause it modifies the term 'colleges and\n           universities.\" -- plural terms, -- while:\n           at the time the provision was adopted,\n           there was but one university and one col-\n           lege for whoseestablishment provmon     had\n           been made by the Legislature. The people\n           certainly intended that support should be\n           given the one university and the one col-\n           lege already established; they as clearly\n           intended that others might be established,\n           else they would have limited the provision\n           to the one university and the one college\n           instead of using the general plural terms\n           'colleges and universities.'\n\fHon.

And that\n          the 'colleges and universities1 which may be\n          established under the authority of Section 40\n          are not limited in number or kind by the pro-\n          visions with respect to the 'University of\n          Texas' and the particular *Agricultural and\n          Mechanical College' referred to 1s~a proposi-\n          tion demonstrable by the fact that the gen-\n          eral language of Section 48 is much too broad\n          to be limited to these,two institutions and\n          their branches.\"\n     In 1928, the Attorney General was called upon to determir\nwhether the School of Mines and Metallurgy was a branch of The\nUniversity of Texas within the intendment of Article VII ~of ti\nConstitution, and if so whether money could be appropriated OL\nof the general-revenue to be used for the erection of buildin\nat El Paso.\n      An Opinion by D. A. Simmons, then First Assistant Attornc\n General, and recently President of the American Bar Associatic\n held that the school was not a branch of The University; that\n'the Legislature had full.authority to establish a School of\n Mines and Metallurgy at El Paso under authority of Article II:\n Section 48, including erection of buildings with general reve-\n nue funds. A portion of the opinion reads:\n          \"It is a matter of common knowledge that the\n          available University fund is not sufficient\n          at this time to pay for the erection of build-\n          ings needed at the main university and the\n          Medical-Department to say nothing of the\n          School of Mines and Metallurgy. . . . If\n          the School of Mines and Metallurgy is limited\n          by Article VII, Section 14, as a part of the\n          University of Texas, it can look only to the\n          available University fund just as the Univer-\n          sity proper, the Medical Department and the\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 11\n\n\n          colored branch must look to that fund.   Paren-\n\n\n\n          tutional provision, it may apply to the Legis-\n          lature for all necessary relief.\n          *In our opinion, the School of Mines and Metal-\n          lurgy is not a branch ~of the University of\n          Texas, as the term 'branch' is used in the\n          Constitution of Texas.\" (Underscoring ours)\n     In Mumme vs. Marrs.,supra, Chief Justice Cureton wrote\nthat Section 5 of Article VII defining the Available School\nFund, and declaring that \"it shall be distributed to the\nseveral counties according to their scholastic population\",\nwas not a limitation which prevented the distribution of an\nappropriation from the general revenue for common school dis-\ntricts in accordance with the Rural Aid Act. In arriving at\nsuch conclusion, Chief Justice Cureton said:\n         \"The history of educational legislation in\n         this State shows that the~provisions of Arti-\n         cle VII, the educational article of the Con-\n         stitution, have never been regarded as limi-\n         tations by implication on the general Dower\"--'-'-\n         of the Legislature to pass laws upon the sub-\n         ject of education. This article discloses a\n         Gell-considered purpose on the part of those\n         who framed it to bring about the establishment\n         and maintenance of a comprehensive system of\n         public education, consisting of a general pub-\n         lic free school system and a system~of higher\n         education. Three institutions of higher learn-\n         ing were expressly provided for.... The Legis-\n         lature, however, has gone far beyond the crea-\n         tion of the three institutions of higher learn-\n         ing specifically required by the organic law,\n         and has created ten additional MStitUtiOnS\n         of similar character without direct COnStitU-\n         tional grant, beginning with the Sam Houston\n         Normal in Huntsville in 1879. . . . In found-\n         ing these ten institutions, beginning more than\n         fifty years ago, the Legislature has necessar-\n         ily held that the specific grants of power con-\n         tained in the Constitution to erect and maintain\n         the University of Texas .     were not linita-\n         tions on its power to create-other schools of\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 12\n\n\n          similar purpose, and to maintain them by\n          appropriations from the General Revenue.\n          This interpretation has never been ques-\n          tioned, and is consistent with authorities:\n          from other jurisdictions. . . .I1 (Under-\n          scoring ours).\n      This holding in Mumme vs. Marrs was reaffirmed by the\n Supreme court of Texas in giving an unqualified refusal to\n an application for writ of error in Watson vs. Sabine Royal-\n ty Corporation, 120 S. W. (2d) 938, a case upholding the con-\n stitutionality of a legislative Act providing for a different\n.rate of tax valuation in a particular group of counties by a\n method different from that set out in the Constitution.\n     In the meantime, the Legislature, under its general pow-\ners and those specifically authorized by Section 48, Article\nIII of the Constitution, has established to date fourteen\nstatutory colleges, to wit:\n     John Tarleton Agricultural College, North Texas Agri-\ncultural College, Texas State College for Women, Texas Col-\nlege of Arts and Industries, College of Mines and Metallurgy,\nTexas Technological College, East Texas State Teachers Col-\nlege, North Texas State Teachers College, Sam Houston State\nTeachers College, Southwest State Teachers College, Stephen\nF. Austin State Teachers College, Sul Ross State Teachers Col-\nlege, West Texas State Teachers College, and Prairie View\nUniversity.\n     It is important to note that although one of these sta-\ntutory colleges is under management of The University of\nTexas Board of Regents, none of them have been held to be a\nbranch of The University or subject to-limitations or restric-\ntions imposed by:Article VII on the funds that may be used\ntherefor.\n        CONCLUSION OF TEXAS COBSTITUTIOX4L PROVISIOW\n     The above background and history of legislative, judi-\ncial, and executive interpretations leave no cloubtabout the\nintent of the writers of the educational provisions of our\nTexas Constitution. They intended to provide for establish-\nment of a great University of Texas with a separate negro\nCollege or Branch to be established and maintained out of the\navailable University Fund. But in Svicle               VII,\nthey left the time -- the \"if\" and \"when\" -- of such estab-\nlishment to the sound discretion of the Texas Legislature by\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 13\n\n\nuse of the words \"when deemed practicable\"by the Legislam\nture.\n     The same writers, in the same document (Sec. 48, Art.\nIII), intended the establishment and maintenance of other\ncolleges and universities out of general revenue funds.\nThe first of these statutory institutions was in fact a\nnegro college at Prairie View created by legislative Act\nin 1876, shortly after the present Constitution became\neffective. Some of the members of the Constitutional Con-\nvention were also members of the Legislature which inter-\npreted the new Constitution as permitting and authorizing\na statutory college in addition to the constitutional\nbranch mentioned in Section 14. As heretofore pointed\nout, the President of the Constitutional Convention later\nserved as President of the Board of Directors of A. & M.\nCollege and helped to organize and direct the activities\nof the separate negro college at Prairie View. If it be\ntrue that Section 14 presents the only manner in which a\nnegro college can be established, then Prairie View Uni-\nversity has been operated in violation of the Texas Consti-\ntution, since 1876. Such a construction would do violence\nto the plain and unambiguous words of the Constitution and\nto the intent and interpretations placed thereon by the\nmen who wrote the document and the legislative and execu-\ntive~interpretations made thereon for the past 70 years.\nTrue, there were a few years during which certain officials\nmistakenly believed that Prairie View was the constitution-\nal branch of The University and entitled to 'the use of the\navailable University Fund (even Judge Cureton mistakenly\nreferred to it as such in dictum in Mumme vs. Marrs, su-\nPra). But for the past 64 years Prairie View has been\ntreated by the Legislature as a separate statutory insti-\ntution entitled to appropriations from the General Reve-\nnue Fund. As stated above, during these years the Legis-\nlature has continued to so interpret and use its power in\nthe creation of 13 additional statutory institutions of\nhigher learning.\n     It is evident that during the past 70 years the Legis-\nlature has deemed it impracticable to establish and main-\ntain a negro college or branch financed wholly out of-\ncome from the Permanent University Fund. An examination\nof the available revenues from such fund d,uringthe past\n70 years reveals why such action was not only impractica-\nble but impossible. Since 1876, the revenues from the fund\nhave not been half enough to finance the building program,\nmaintenance and operation of the Main University and the\nMedical Branch. During the same period of time it has been\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 14\n\n\nnecessary for the Legislature to appropriate from the General\nRevenue Fund in excess of fifty-three millionsdollars to main-\ntain and operate these two institutions. Texas A. 6cM. Col-\nlege received no part of the available fund until 1931, and\nits share of one-third of such fund produces only a fraction\nof the money necessary to maintain and o*mrate A. & M. Col-\nlege. During the first year of the present biennium the net\nrevenue from the Permanent University Fund yielded only\n$1,932,711.41 for the Main University, the Medical Branch,\nand Texas A. & M. College. To this amount it was necessary\nfor the Legislature to add $6,299,551.89 from the General\nRevenue to operate these schools for the past fiscal year.\n(Records of C. D. Simmons, Comptroller, University of Texas).\n     With these figures in mind, the present Legislature is\ncertainly justified in deeming it impracticable to build and\nmaintain a first class negro university out of the revenues\nfrom the University Fund. Senate Bill 140 calls for a total\nexpenditure of two million dollars for the acquisition of\nland and the erection of buildings and provides one million\ndollars for maintenance and operation during the next two\nyears. If maintenance of the negrc university were limited\nto a portion of the available University Fund as required in\nthe case of the constitutional branch (Sec. 14, Art. VII),\nit would be impossible to sustain a first class university of\nthe magnitude contemplated by Senate Bill 140.\n     In so far as the Texas Constitution is concerned, it is\nour opinion that Senate Bill 140 is constitutional. Respect-\ning your request for suggested changes or additions, our only\nadvice in this connection is that a section be added specifi-\ncally reciting the Legislature's intent and findings as to the\nimpracticability of establishing the school in any other man-\nner. Suggested wording of this section will be delivered with\nthis opinion.\n              U. S. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\n     Fortunately, the operation of an educational system within\na S,tate is still a State right. It was so held in an opinion\nby Chief Justice Hughes in the case of Missouri ex rel Gaines\nvs. Canada, 305 U. S. Reports 337.' The Federal Government and\nthe Federal Courts have not thus far interfered with the nmn-\nagement and operation of the educational systems of our states,\nexcept to say that under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States, equal protection of the law must be given\nall citizens, and State supported institutions must furnish\nequal facilities for both white and colored citizens. As late\n\fFlon.George Moffett - Page 15\n\n\nas 1938 in the above case, the Supreme Court of the United~\nStates recognized the right of the states to have separate\nschools for white and negro citizens, if the separate system\nfurnished equal protection of the laws and substantially\nequal educational facilities. The Supreme Court of the Uni-\nted States has not spoken directly on the point since 1938,\nbut it is sincerely believed that the Court will uphold Tex-\n  t right to establish separate schools for negroes if it\ntztually and in fact provides substantially equivalent facili-\nties and equal protection as proposed in Senate Bill 140.\n     The pertinent portion of the 14th Amendment to the Con-\nstitution of the United States reads as follows:\n         \"Section 1. All persons born or natura-\n         lized in the United States, and subject\n         to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens\n         of the United States and of the State\n         wherein they reside. No State shall make\n         or enforce any law which shall abridge the\n         privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n         United States; nor shall any State deprive\n         any person of life, liberty, or~property,\n         without due process of law; nor deny to\n         any person within its jurisdiction the equal\n         protection of the laws.\"\n     The Texas Constitution, Section 7, Article VII, provides\nthe following:\n          \"Sec. 7. Separate schools shall be provided\n          for the white and colored children, and impar-\n          tial provision shall be made for both.\"\n     Since 1876 the policy of this State has been to maintain\nseparate schools and colleges as contemplated by Senate Bill\n140. The people and public officials of Texas recognize that\nequivalent educational opportunities have not been available\nto the degree required by both State and Federal Constitutions,\nor to the degree demanded by the public sentiment Of the State.\nBut the majority of the people and public officials of Texas\nalso recognize that the only satisfactory means of accompli-\nshing equal opportunities within the social order of this\nStnte is to have separate schools for the separate races. A\nrecent state-wide poll of both white and colored citizens in-\ndicated that such was the sentiment of a great majority of both\nraces. (Belden Texas Poll, January 26, 1947).\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 16\n\n\n     In spite of previous decisions of the United States Su-\npreme Court and the sentiment of the majority of both races,\nthere is some agitation in this and other Southern States\nagainst separate schools. This office today is defending a\ncase in which one of the main contentions is that the legal-\nity of separate schools be denied. (Heman Marion Sweatt vs.\nPainter, et al, now pending in the Austin Court of Civil Ap-\npeals). Other cases are pending in Louisiana, Oklahoma and\nSouth Carolina. In each instance the negro applicants are\ncontending for admission to the State Universities for white\ncitizens, alleging that equal facilities do not exist for ne-\ngroes, and concentrating their attack against the constitu-\ntionality of laws requiring separate schools. These contes-\ntants evidence as much interest in prevailing on the Supreme\nCourt to reverse its former holdings and abolish segregation\nas in obtaining equivalent education in separate schools.\nWith this in mind several of the leading decisions of the\nUnited States Supreme Court will be cited and discussed.\n     The United States Supreme Court in Plessy vs. Ferguson,\n163 U. S. 537, said the following:\n          \"The object of,the (14th) Amendment was\n          undoubtedly to enforce the absolute .equal-\n          ity of the two races before the law, but\n          in the nature of things it could not have\n          been intended to abolish distinctions based\n          upon color, or to enforce social, as dis-\n          tinguished from political equality, or a\n          commingling of the two races upon terms un-\n          satisfactory to either. Laws permitting,\n          and even requiring, their separation in\n          places where they are liable to be brought\n          into contact do not necessarily imply the\n          inferiority of either race to the other, and\n          has been generally, if not universally, reo-\n          ognized as within the competency of the\n          state legislatures in the exercise of their\n          police power. The most common instance of\n          this is connected with the establishment of\n          separate schools for white and colored chil-\n          dren, which has been held to be a valid ex-\n          ercise of the legislative power even by\n          courts of States where the political rights\n          of the colored race have been longest and\n          most earnestly enforced.\"\n\fHon. George moffett - Page 17\n\n\n     In the case of Missouri ex rel Gaines vs. Canada, supra,\nthe United States Supreme Court considered the Missouri sta-\ntutes requiring separate schools for colored and white stu-\ndents and reversed an opinion of.the Supreme Court of Missouri,\nwhich had denied a negro applicant entrance to the University\nof Missouri Law School. In the opinion by l.9. Chief Justice\nRughes, the Court ssid:\n         \"In answering petitioner's contention that\n         this discrimination constituted a denial\n         of his constitutional right, the state\n         court has fully recognized the obligation\n         of the State to provide negroes with advan-\n         tages for higher education substantially\n         equal to the advantages afforded to white\n         students. The State has sought to fulfill\n         that obligation by furnishing equal facili-\n         ties in separate schools, a method the va-\n         lidity of which has been sustained bv our.\n         decisions.

It .issaid that Missouri~is a\n         pioneer in that field and is the only State\n         in the Union which has established a sepa-\n         rate university for negroes on the same\n         basis as the state university for white\n         students. But, commendable as is that ac-\n         tion, the fact remains that instruction in\n         law for negroes is not now afforded by the\n         State, either at Lincoln University or else-\n         where within the State, and that the State\n         excludes negroos from the advantages of the\n         law school it has established at the Univer-\n         sity of Missouri.

Murray 169 Md. 478;\n         182 A. 590.

The\n         provision for legal education at Lincoln is at\n         present entirely lacking. Respondents, coun-\n         sel urge that if, on the date when petitioner\n         applied for admission to the University of Mis-'\n         souri, he had instead applied to the curators\n         of Lincoln University it would have been their\n         duty to establish a law school; that this\n         'agency of the State,, to which he should\n         have applied, was ,specificallg charged with\n         the mandatory duty to furnish him what he seeks.,\n         We d,onot read the opinion of the Supreme Court\n         as construing the state statute to impose such\n         a 'mandatory duty, as the argument see.msto as-\n         sert. . . .\n         \" . . .

George Moffett - Page 20\n\n\nthis test to the plan proposed in Senate Bill 140, the first\nrequirement of equal opportunities and facilities surely will\nbe met if this Bill is enacted and conscientiously admini-\nstered by the Board to be appointed thereunder.\n     It is only on the second requirement -- equal protection\nof the laws -- that advocates of a constitutional rather than\na statutory school raise two objections worth considering.\n      The first objection is that a constitutional College or\nBranch under Section 14, Article VII of the Texas Constitution\nwould give the negro school larger and more permanent funds\nthan those available to a statutory university; that by de-\nvoting all of the available University Fund to white schools\nalready established, and financing the negro university from\nthe general revenue, equal protection of laws is denied the\nnegro race and the negro school. This objection involves a\ndistinction without a difference and would have no bearing\nwhatever on the constitutionality of Senate Bill 140. As far\nas finances are concerned, equal protection will be given so\nlong as sufficient funds are appropriated to establish and\noperate an equivalent university for negroes. It makes no\n difference which pocket the State pays the money from so'long\nas equal facilities are afforded. As far as money is con-\n cerned, this bill has nothing to do with the Permanent Uni-\nversity Fund. In fact, a real discrimination and unequal pro-\ntection would exist if the proposed university was created as\na College or Branch under Article VII, because that Article\n (Sec. 14) denies use of the general fund for maintenance of a\n negro university, but permits use of the general fund for\n~maintenance of the white university. Whether on purpose or\nthrough inadvertence, the writers of Article VII included a\n financial discrimination in Section 14 that does not apply to\n the other Sections. Senate Bill 140 would appropriate more\nmoney ($2,000,000.00) for construction of a negro university\n than the entire University Fund produced last year. It would\n appropriate $500,000.00 per year for maintenance and opera-\n tion, a sum in excess of one-fourth of the total present an-\n nual revenue from the University Fund. It is obvious that\n this is more money than a constitutional Negro College or\nBranch would ever receive if confined to a share of the Uni-\n versity Fund for its existence. Therefore, financially, far\n greater protection is given the statutory university under\n Senate Bill 140 than it would receive as a constitutional\nBranch under Section 14.\n     The only possible remaining financial argument is that\nthe University and its branches for white students (Main\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 21\n\n\nUniversity, Medical School, and ~A. & M.) are using income from\nthe available fund,'part of which was intended for negroes, and\nthat the Fund,may become so great in the ,futurethat it would\nadequately finance all the constitutional branches (including a\nnegro branch) ,when and if the general revenue should ever be in-\nsufficient. Morally .this does.sound unfair, but legally the\nanswer is both fair and moral. .To.the extent of every dollar\nintended and needed for negro~education out of the University\nFund but actually used for white schools, the Legislature has\nbeen appropriating from the general revenue an equal amount for\nPrairie View, and now seeks to appropriate an even greater amount\nfor a Negro University of the first class. When the day comes\nthat the University Fund has so much revenue that it can ade-\nqsately maintain and support the present constitutional schools\n2nd a Negro University, that may be the time when the Legisla-\nture will deem it practicable to establish a Negro College or\nSranch University under Section 14. Unless changed or re-\nTealed, Section 14 will remain for future use and needs if\nthey should 'arise, and nothing done in connection with Senate\nXl1 140 will.have any effect upon presentsor future rights of\nnegro citizens accorded thereby.\n     The second objection made to 'a statutory university, under\nthe requirement of equal protection of laws, is that a statu-\ntory school lacks the guarantee of permanence that is enjoyed\nby the constitutional schools; that equal .protectionfrom aban-\ndonment and change now afforded the constitutional white univer-\nsity and its branches would not be.afforded the statutory negro\nuniversity. This argument has apparent merit. It is not an ob-\njection that would make Senate Bill 140 unconstitutional, but\nit may be used as persuasive argument against the constitution-\nality of a system of separate schools which gives greater pro-\ntection to the legal existence of the university.for whites and\nits branches than to the university for negroes.\n      It is believed that there is enough merit in this last ob-\n jection to warrant your consideration of a constitutional amend-\n ment recognizing the university which may be established by Sen-\n ate Bill 140 as a constitutional university for negroes and\n giving the term of its existence the same guarantee as that now\n afforded the Main University for white students. Such amend-\n ment would necessitate no delay in consideration of Senate Bill\n 140. It could be submitted and voted upon after passage of Sen-\n ate Bill 140, simply giving constitutional approval and recog-\nnition to the new university created by Senate Bill 140.\n     In this connection, considering the past, present, and\nprospective impossibilities and discrimination of Section 14\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 22\n\n\nof Article VII of our Texas Constitution, you may wish to con-\nsider the advisability of repealing or amending that Section\nby substituting therefor the amendment suggested above and\nsubstituting financial provisions as contemplated by Senate\nBill 140 in place of participation in an already inadequate\nPermanent University Fund. If such financial provisions are\nat least equal to any anticipated share for negroes from the\nUniversity Fund, this would forever end the contentions now\nbeing made in the courts and public forum against a statu-\ntory university.\n          CONCLUSION ON U. S. CONSTITDTIONAL PROVISIORS\n     As indicated above, it is the opinion of the Attorney Gen-\neral that Senate Bill 140 does not violate the 14th amendment\nto the Constitution of the United States. The State olan of\nseparate schools is valid so long as substantially equal fa-\ncilities and equal protection of the laws are afforded.\n     A decision to this effect was recently made by a District\nCourt of Travis County in the case of Sweatt vs. Painter, et\nal. This case is now on appeal, and all indications are that\nit will go to the Supreme Court of the United States. Thus\nunless the 50th Legislature takes immediate action on this iub-\nject, the Supreme Court may be called upon to pass on the issue\nof separate schools in Texas without knowledge of the prevail-\ning sentiment, intention, and actual establishment of a first\nclass negro university in Texas.\n     Prompt enactment of a bill similar to Senate Bill 140\nwould actually provide what our Negro citizens are entitled\nto, and it would have a great bearing upon successful defense\nof the constitutionality of separate schools. Both of these\npropositions are of foremost importance to Texas. If the Bill\nis enacted, this office will make known its existence and ope-\nration to the courts in all pending cases.\n     In line with your request for suggestions, it is further\nrecommended that the provisions of the Bill for interim instruc-\ntion pending establishment of the Texas State University for\nNegroes be strengthened and made mandatory. The suggested\nchanges and additions have been prepared and will be delivered\nherewith.\n\fHon.

Therefore,\nyou will pardon the necessary length of this opinion:\n            TEXAS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIOEF,\n     Under the Texas Constitution, public education is a\ndivision or department of the government, in the conduct\nof which the Legislature has all legislative power not de-\nnied it by the Constitution. (Mumme, et al vs. Marrs Tex-\nas Supreme Court, opinion by Judge Cureton, 40 S. W. (2d)\n31). Section 1 of Article VII, of the Constitution of Tex-\nas, reads as follows:\n         \"A general diffusion of knowledge being\n         essential to the preservation oftthe lib-\n         erties and rights of the people, it shall\n         be the duty of the Legislature of the\n         State to establish and make suitable pro-\n         vision for the support and maintenance of\n         an efficient system of public fxee schools.\"\n     Section 40 of Article III of the Texas Constitution em-\npowers the Legislature \"to levy taxes or impose burdens upon\nthe people\" to raise revenue for many purposes, among them\nthe following:\n         \"The support of public schools, in which\n         shall be included colleges ja& universi-\n         ties established b the State; . . .'I\n         7â€˜i7Xerscoringours7\n     From the above it is clear that the Legislature of\nTexas has the power to provide for the establishment and\n\fbn. George Xoffett - Psge 3\n\n\noperation of a negro university as contemplated by Senate\nSill 140,,unless there is some other constitutional pro-\nvision which prohibits such action or directs that it be ac-\ncoalished in a different manner. That brings us to an ex-\namination of Section 14 of Article VII, of the Constitution\nzf Texas, the only other constitutional provision relating\niiirectlyto this question. It reads as follows:\n           \"Sec. 14. Branch University for\n           Colored.--The Legislature shall also\n           when deemed practicable, establish\n           and provide for the maintenance of a\n           College or Branch University for the\n           instruction of the colored youths of\n           the State, to be located by a vote of\n           the people; Provided, that no tax\n           shall be levied, and no money appro-\n           priated, out of the general revenue,\n           either for this purpose or for the\n           establishment, and erection of the\n           buildings of the University of Texas.\"\n     Immediately we are faced with the question of whether the\nUniversity contemplated by Senate Bill 140 is the same as.that\noontemplated by the u;ritersof the above Section of the Con-\nstitution in 1876. Is it to be a College (integral part of a\nuniversity) or a Branch of the University of Texas? Does the\nLe.+lature by this Bill \"deem it practicable\" to provide for\nthe establishment and maintenance of such College or Branch\nout of the available fund accruing from the Permanent Univer-\nsity Fund and without aid of taxes and appropriations from the\nGeneral Revenue as would be required by the above section of\nthe Constitution? We think the answer is *no**to both of these\nquestions. It is clear from a reading of Senate Bill 140 that\nthe proposed negro university is not to be a Cqllege or Branch\nof The University of Texas. Its passage would evidence no in-\ndication that the Legislature \"deems it practicable\" to estab-\nlish and maintain such University under the limitation as to\nuse of taxes and general revenue for such purpose. On the\ncontrary, passage of Senate Bill 140 would indicate that an\nentirely separate university for negroes is to be established\nfree and independent of The University of Texas with full right\nto establishment, maintenance and erection of buildinas out of\nthe General Revenue Fund of the State.\n     This conclusion forces the question of whether the Legis-\nlature having been authorized when \"deemed practicable\" to\nestablish a negro university in the manner set out in Section\n14 of Article VII of the Constitution, can lawfully adopt a\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 4\n\n\ndifferent method and establish a different school out of other\nState funds. In other words, does the above section of our\nConstitution limit the manner of establishin? a nerro school\nof hither leominT to the procedure and fund~sprovided there-\nin? If so, the statutory school proposer!in Senate Bill 140\nis unconstitutional, and the only means of creating a negro\nuniversity in Texas is to establish it as a College or Branch\nof The University of Texas without appropriations from the\ngeneral revenue, and its location nust be in Austin, the city\nchosen for such college or branch by a vote of the people in\n1882. If not, Senate Bill 140 is constitutional, and the ne-\ngro university may be established out of general revenue and\nat any location desired by the Legislature.\n     We are familiar with the rule of law that a constitu-\ntional provision as to how a thing shall be done cotititutes\nan implied prohibition of its being done in.any other manner.\nHowever, when the constitutional provision is not mandatory\nbut leaves discretion with the Legislature as to when, if\nand how a thing is to be done, it should never be construed\nas a limitation by implication on the general power of the\nLegislature to accomplish the desired end in another manner.\nEspecially is this true in the present case where another\nconstitutional provision (Section 48, Article III) written\nin the same Convention; expressly recognizes the power of\nthe Legislature to establish and operate other colleges and\nuniversities in another manner.\n     Constitutional provisions, like statutes, are properly\nto be interpreted in the light of conditions existing at the\ntime of their adoption, the general spirit of the times and\nthe prevailing sentiments of the people. (Rumme vs. Marrs,\nsupra) The universal rule of construction is that legisla-\ntive and executive interpretations of the organic law, ac-\nquiesced in and long continued are of great weight in deter-\nmining the validity of any Act; and in case of ambiguity or\ndoubt will be followed by the courts. 9 Tex.

The elec-\n  tion was held and the proposal to separate the main university\n  from the Medical Department prevailed, Austin being chosen\n  for the former and Galveston for the latter.\n       In 1882 the Legislature recognized that the Prairie View\n  Normal was not the colored branch of the University mentioned\n  in the Constitution, and an election was ordered for the first\n  Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1882, to locate\n  this branch. (Acts 1882, ch. 19, p. 25). The contesting pla-\n  ces were Austin, Prairie View, Houston, Palestine, Paris, Bren-\n  ham, Pittsburg and Georgetown. Austin was again successful.\n  Governor Roberts in his message to the 18th Legislature, de-\n  livered January 10, 1883, said \"all branches of The State Uni-\n  versity have now been located; the main branch at Austin; the\n  'uiedical\n          Department at Galveston; the Agricultural and Mechani-\n  cal College at Bryan; and at the late General Election, the\n  branch university for colored youths at Austin.\"\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 8\n\n\n      At-the Regular Session of the 18th Legislature in 1883, an\n Act was passed to \"provide for the permanent endowment, in lands\n or,its proceeds, of The University of Texas and its branches,\n including the branch for the instruction of colored youths.\"\n (Acts 18th Leg., oh. 72, p. 71). This act set aside one mil-\n'lion.acres for an additional endowment of The University and\n its branches. The branch for colored youths was expressly in-\n cluded.\n     Between 1883 and 1897 no legislation pertaining to a negro\ncollege or branch of The University of Texas was passed, althougl\nseveral bills were proposed. In 1897 the Legislature set aside\none hundred thousand acres of.the public domain to be used for\nthe endowment of the colored branch'~(26thLeg., 1897, ch. 109,\np. 148), but later it was held that the public domain was ex-\nhausted (</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3978717\"><a href=\"/opinion/4206803/hogue-v-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) and this endowment was â€˜never consummated.\n     In 1931 Article 2592 was enacted, which provided, among\nother things, that after September 1, 1934, the Available Uni-\nversity Fund, derived as revenue from the Permanent Fund of one\nmillion acres of land provided for in the Constitution and the\nadditional one million acres of land provided for in the Sta-\ntute of 1083, should be allocated to The University of Texas\nand the Agricultural and Mechanical College in the proportions\nof two-thirds and one-third, respectively.\n     The 49th Legislature in 1945 enacted Article 2643a which\nchanged the name of Prairie View State Normal and Industrial\nCollege to \"Prairie View University.\" The Act further provided\nthat \"whenever there is any demand for same, the Board of Direc-\ntors of the Agricultural and Mechanical College, in addition to\nthe courses of study now authorized for said institution is au-\nthorized to provide for,the establishment of â€˜-courses in law,\nmedicine, engineering, pharmacy, journalism, or any other gen-\nerally recognized college course taught at the University of Tex-\nas, in said Prairie View University, which courses shall be sub-\nstantially equivalent to those offered at the ,University,of\nTexas.\n     When two additional'statutory schools (West Texas A. & M.\nCollege and North Texas Agricultural College) were proposed in\n1917, Attorney General B. F. Looney was asked for an opinion on\nthe constitutionality of their establishment at places other\nthan Austin or Bryan. The problem involved the same question\nOf whether the Legislature had the power to-establish inatitu-\ntions of higher learning in any other manner than as provided\nin Article VII of the Constitution. In an able opinion written\nby Luther Nickels, who later served as a Commissioner to the\nTexas Supreme Court,,it was held that the Legislature was au-\nthorized under Seotion 48 of Article III, supra, to establish\n\f                                                               .I\n\n\nRon. George Moffett - Page 9\n\n\nother colleges and universities and support them out of the\ngeneral revenue.\n     Judge Nickels pointed out that such statutory universi-\nties would not be branches of The University of Texas within\nthe meaning of Article VII. A portion of this opinion is as\nfollows:\n           YSection 48 of Article 3 of the Consti-\n           tution empowers the Legislature 'to levy\n           taxes or impose burdens upon the people,'\n           to raise revenue for the economical ad-\n           ministration of the government in which\n           may be included the following purposes:\n           \"t . . . The support of public schools,\n           in which shall be included colleges and\n           universities established by the State;\n           . . .,\n           \". . . The language is that the Legisla-\n           ture may prov1d.efor 'colleges and uni-\n           versities,' -- both terms being in the\n           plural. This general language, undoubted-,\n           lv. includes the 'Universitv of Texas' and\n           the 'Agricultural and Mechanical College'\n           established by the Act of April 17, 1871,\n           but it also includes such other 'colleges\n           and universities as may be established by the\n           State'. The term 'established by the\n           State' is both prospective and retrospec-\n           tive in meaning; this must be true, be-\n           cause it modifies the term 'colleges and\n           universities.\" -- plural terms, -- while:\n           at the time the provision was adopted,\n           there was but one university and one col-\n           lege for whoseestablishment provmon     had\n           been made by the Legislature. The people\n           certainly intended that support should be\n           given the one university and the one col-\n           lege already established; they as clearly\n           intended that others might be established,\n           else they would have limited the provision\n           to the one university and the one college\n           instead of using the general plural terms\n           'colleges and universities.'\n\fHon.

The answer is obvious\n          The body -- the Legislature -- in whom is ves-\n          ted,the general power, has also the power to\n          do all things needful for the full accomplish-\n          ment of the general purpose. . . .

A. Simmons, then First Assistant Attornc\n General, and recently President of the American Bar Associatic\n held that the school was not a branch of The University; that\n'the Legislature had full.authority to establish a School of\n Mines and Metallurgy at El Paso under authority of Article II:\n Section 48, including erection of buildings with general reve-\n nue funds. A portion of the opinion reads:\n          \"It is a matter of common knowledge that the\n          available University fund is not sufficient\n          at this time to pay for the erection of build-\n          ings needed at the main university and the\n          Medical-Department to say nothing of the\n          School of Mines and Metallurgy. . . . If\n          the School of Mines and Metallurgy is limited\n          by Article VII, Section 14, as a part of the\n          University of Texas, it can look only to the\n          available University fund just as the Univer-\n          sity proper, the Medical Department and the\n\fHon.

In arriving at\nsuch conclusion, Chief Justice Cureton said:\n         \"The history of educational legislation in\n         this State shows that the~provisions of Arti-\n         cle VII, the educational article of the Con-\n         stitution, have never been regarded as limi-\n         tations by implication on the general Dower\"--'-'-\n         of the Legislature to pass laws upon the sub-\n         ject of education. This article discloses a\n         Gell-considered purpose on the part of those\n         who framed it to bring about the establishment\n         and maintenance of a comprehensive system of\n         public education, consisting of a general pub-\n         lic free school system and a system~of higher\n         education. Three institutions of higher learn-\n         ing were expressly provided for.... The Legis-\n         lature, however, has gone far beyond the crea-\n         tion of the three institutions of higher learn-\n         ing specifically required by the organic law,\n         and has created ten additional MStitUtiOnS\n         of similar character without direct COnStitU-\n         tional grant, beginning with the Sam Houston\n         Normal in Huntsville in 1879. . . . In found-\n         ing these ten institutions, beginning more than\n         fifty years ago, the Legislature has necessar-\n         ily held that the specific grants of power con-\n         tained in the Constitution to erect and maintain\n         the University of Texas .     were not linita-\n         tions on its power to create-other schools of\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 12\n\n\n          similar purpose, and to maintain them by\n          appropriations from the General Revenue.\n          This interpretation has never been ques-\n          tioned, and is consistent with authorities:\n          from other jurisdictions. . . .I1 (Under-\n          scoring ours).\n      This holding in Mumme vs. Marrs was reaffirmed by the\n Supreme court of Texas in giving an unqualified refusal to\n an application for writ of error in Watson vs. Sabine Royal-\n ty Corporation, 120 S. W. (2d) 938, a case upholding the con-\n stitutionality of a legislative Act providing for a different\n.rate of tax valuation in a particular group of counties by a\n method different from that set out in the Constitution.\n     In the meantime, the Legislature, under its general pow-\ners and those specifically authorized by Section 48, Article\nIII of the Constitution, has established to date fourteen\nstatutory colleges, to wit:\n     John Tarleton Agricultural College, North Texas Agri-\ncultural College, Texas State College for Women, Texas Col-\nlege of Arts and Industries, College of Mines and Metallurgy,\nTexas Technological College, East Texas State Teachers Col-\nlege, North Texas State Teachers College, Sam Houston State\nTeachers College, Southwest State Teachers College, Stephen\nF. Austin State Teachers College, Sul Ross State Teachers Col-\nlege, West Texas State Teachers College, and Prairie View\nUniversity.\n     It is important to note that although one of these sta-\ntutory colleges is under management of The University of\nTexas Board of Regents, none of them have been held to be a\nbranch of The University or subject to-limitations or restric-\ntions imposed by:Article VII on the funds that may be used\ntherefor.\n        CONCLUSION OF TEXAS COBSTITUTIOX4L PROVISIOW\n     The above background and history of legislative, judi-\ncial, and executive interpretations leave no cloubtabout the\nintent of the writers of the educational provisions of our\nTexas Constitution. They intended to provide for establish-\nment of a great University of Texas with a separate negro\nCollege or Branch to be established and maintained out of the\navailable University Fund. But in Svicle               VII,\nthey left the time -- the \"if\" and \"when\" -- of such estab-\nlishment to the sound discretion of the Texas Legislature by\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 13\n\n\nuse of the words \"when deemed practicable\"by the Legislam\nture.\n     The same writers, in the same document (Sec. 48, Art.\nIII), intended the establishment and maintenance of other\ncolleges and universities out of general revenue funds.\nThe first of these statutory institutions was in fact a\nnegro college at Prairie View created by legislative Act\nin 1876, shortly after the present Constitution became\neffective. Some of the members of the Constitutional Con-\nvention were also members of the Legislature which inter-\npreted the new Constitution as permitting and authorizing\na statutory college in addition to the constitutional\nbranch mentioned in Section 14. As heretofore pointed\nout, the President of the Constitutional Convention later\nserved as President of the Board of Directors of A. & M.\nCollege and helped to organize and direct the activities\nof the separate negro college at Prairie View. If it be\ntrue that Section 14 presents the only manner in which a\nnegro college can be established, then Prairie View Uni-\nversity has been operated in violation of the Texas Consti-\ntution, since 1876. Such a construction would do violence\nto the plain and unambiguous words of the Constitution and\nto the intent and interpretations placed thereon by the\nmen who wrote the document and the legislative and execu-\ntive~interpretations made thereon for the past 70 years.\nTrue, there were a few years during which certain officials\nmistakenly believed that Prairie View was the constitution-\nal branch of The University and entitled to 'the use of the\navailable University Fund (even Judge Cureton mistakenly\nreferred to it as such in dictum in Mumme vs. Marrs, su-\nPra). But for the past 64 years Prairie View has been\ntreated by the Legislature as a separate statutory insti-\ntution entitled to appropriations from the General Reve-\nnue Fund. As stated above, during these years the Legis-\nlature has continued to so interpret and use its power in\nthe creation of 13 additional statutory institutions of\nhigher learning.\n     It is evident that during the past 70 years the Legis-\nlature has deemed it impracticable to establish and main-\ntain a negro college or branch financed wholly out of-\ncome from the Permanent University Fund. An examination\nof the available revenues from such fund d,uringthe past\n70 years reveals why such action was not only impractica-\nble but impossible. Since 1876, the revenues from the fund\nhave not been half enough to finance the building program,\nmaintenance and operation of the Main University and the\nMedical Branch. During the same period of time it has been\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 14\n\n\nnecessary for the Legislature to appropriate from the General\nRevenue Fund in excess of fifty-three millionsdollars to main-\ntain and operate these two institutions. Texas A. 6cM. Col-\nlege received no part of the available fund until 1931, and\nits share of one-third of such fund produces only a fraction\nof the money necessary to maintain and o*mrate A. & M. Col-\nlege. During the first year of the present biennium the net\nrevenue from the Permanent University Fund yielded only\n$1,932,711.41 for the Main University, the Medical Branch,\nand Texas A. & M. College. To this amount it was necessary\nfor the Legislature to add $6,299,551.89 from the General\nRevenue to operate these schools for the past fiscal year.\n(Records of C. D. Simmons, Comptroller, University of Texas).\n     With these figures in mind, the present Legislature is\ncertainly justified in deeming it impracticable to build and\nmaintain a first class negro university out of the revenues\nfrom the University Fund. Senate Bill 140 calls for a total\nexpenditure of two million dollars for the acquisition of\nland and the erection of buildings and provides one million\ndollars for maintenance and operation during the next two\nyears. If maintenance of the negrc university were limited\nto a portion of the available University Fund as required in\nthe case of the constitutional branch (Sec. 14, Art. VII),\nit would be impossible to sustain a first class university of\nthe magnitude contemplated by Senate Bill 140.\n     In so far as the Texas Constitution is concerned, it is\nour opinion that Senate Bill 140 is constitutional. Respect-\ning your request for suggested changes or additions, our only\nadvice in this connection is that a section be added specifi-\ncally reciting the Legislature's intent and findings as to the\nimpracticability of establishing the school in any other man-\nner. Suggested wording of this section will be delivered with\nthis opinion.\n              U. S. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\n     Fortunately, the operation of an educational system within\na S,tate is still a State right. It was so held in an opinion\nby Chief Justice Hughes in the case of Missouri ex rel Gaines\nvs. Canada, 305 U. S. Reports 337.' The Federal Government and\nthe Federal Courts have not thus far interfered with the nmn-\nagement and operation of the educational systems of our states,\nexcept to say that under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States, equal protection of the law must be given\nall citizens, and State supported institutions must furnish\nequal facilities for both white and colored citizens. As late\n\fFlon.George Moffett - Page 15\n\n\nas 1938 in the above case, the Supreme Court of the United~\nStates recognized the right of the states to have separate\nschools for white and negro citizens, if the separate system\nfurnished equal protection of the laws and substantially\nequal educational facilities. The Supreme Court of the Uni-\nted States has not spoken directly on the point since 1938,\nbut it is sincerely believed that the Court will uphold Tex-\n  t right to establish separate schools for negroes if it\ntztually and in fact provides substantially equivalent facili-\nties and equal protection as proposed in Senate Bill 140.\n     The pertinent portion of the 14th Amendment to the Con-\nstitution of the United States reads as follows:\n         \"Section 1. All persons born or natura-\n         lized in the United States, and subject\n         to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens\n         of the United States and of the State\n         wherein they reside. No State shall make\n         or enforce any law which shall abridge the\n         privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n         United States; nor shall any State deprive\n         any person of life, liberty, or~property,\n         without due process of law; nor deny to\n         any person within its jurisdiction the equal\n         protection of the laws.\"\n     The Texas Constitution, Section 7, Article VII, provides\nthe following:\n          \"Sec. 7. Separate schools shall be provided\n          for the white and colored children, and impar-\n          tial provision shall be made for both.\"\n     Since 1876 the policy of this State has been to maintain\nseparate schools and colleges as contemplated by Senate Bill\n140. The people and public officials of Texas recognize that\nequivalent educational opportunities have not been available\nto the degree required by both State and Federal Constitutions,\nor to the degree demanded by the public sentiment Of the State.\nBut the majority of the people and public officials of Texas\nalso recognize that the only satisfactory means of accompli-\nshing equal opportunities within the social order of this\nStnte is to have separate schools for the separate races. A\nrecent state-wide poll of both white and colored citizens in-\ndicated that such was the sentiment of a great majority of both\nraces. (Belden Texas Poll, January 26, 1947).\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 16\n\n\n     In spite of previous decisions of the United States Su-\npreme Court and the sentiment of the majority of both races,\nthere is some agitation in this and other Southern States\nagainst separate schools. This office today is defending a\ncase in which one of the main contentions is that the legal-\nity of separate schools be denied. (Heman Marion Sweatt vs.\nPainter, et al, now pending in the Austin Court of Civil Ap-\npeals). Other cases are pending in Louisiana, Oklahoma and\nSouth Carolina. In each instance the negro applicants are\ncontending for admission to the State Universities for white\ncitizens, alleging that equal facilities do not exist for ne-\ngroes, and concentrating their attack against the constitu-\ntionality of laws requiring separate schools. These contes-\ntants evidence as much interest in prevailing on the Supreme\nCourt to reverse its former holdings and abolish segregation\nas in obtaining equivalent education in separate schools.\nWith this in mind several of the leading decisions of the\nUnited States Supreme Court will be cited and discussed.\n     The United States Supreme Court in Plessy vs. Ferguson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, said the following:\n          \"The object of,the (14th) Amendment was\n          undoubtedly to enforce the absolute .equal-\n          ity of the two races before the law, but\n          in the nature of things it could not have\n          been intended to abolish distinctions based\n          upon color, or to enforce social, as dis-\n          tinguished from political equality, or a\n          commingling of the two races upon terms un-\n          satisfactory to either. Laws permitting,\n          and even requiring, their separation in\n          places where they are liable to be brought\n          into contact do not necessarily imply the\n          inferiority of either race to the other, and\n          has been generally, if not universally, reo-\n          ognized as within the competency of the\n          state legislatures in the exercise of their\n          police power. The most common instance of\n          this is connected with the establishment of\n          separate schools for white and colored chil-\n          dren, which has been held to be a valid ex-\n          ercise of the legislative power even by\n          courts of States where the political rights\n          of the colored race have been longest and\n          most earnestly enforced.\"\n\fHon. George moffett - Page 17\n\n\n     In the case of Missouri ex rel Gaines vs. Canada, supra,\nthe United States Supreme Court considered the Missouri sta-\ntutes requiring separate schools for colored and white stu-\ndents and reversed an opinion of.the Supreme Court of Missouri,\nwhich had denied a negro applicant entrance to the University\nof Missouri Law School. In the opinion by l.9.

George Moffett - Page 20\n\n\nthis test to the plan proposed in Senate Bill 140, the first\nrequirement of equal opportunities and facilities surely will\nbe met if this Bill is enacted and conscientiously admini-\nstered by the Board to be appointed thereunder.\n     It is only on the second requirement -- equal protection\nof the laws -- that advocates of a constitutional rather than\na statutory school raise two objections worth considering.\n      The first objection is that a constitutional College or\nBranch under Section 14, Article VII of the Texas Constitution\nwould give the negro school larger and more permanent funds\nthan those available to a statutory university; that by de-\nvoting all of the available University Fund to white schools\nalready established, and financing the negro university from\nthe general revenue, equal protection of laws is denied the\nnegro race and the negro school. This objection involves a\ndistinction without a difference and would have no bearing\nwhatever on the constitutionality of Senate Bill 140. As far\nas finances are concerned, equal protection will be given so\nlong as sufficient funds are appropriated to establish and\noperate an equivalent university for negroes. It makes no\n difference which pocket the State pays the money from so'long\nas equal facilities are afforded. As far as money is con-\n cerned, this bill has nothing to do with the Permanent Uni-\nversity Fund. In fact, a real discrimination and unequal pro-\ntection would exist if the proposed university was created as\na College or Branch under Article VII, because that Article\n (Sec. 14) denies use of the general fund for maintenance of a\n negro university, but permits use of the general fund for\n~maintenance of the white university. Whether on purpose or\nthrough inadvertence, the writers of Article VII included a\n financial discrimination in Section 14 that does not apply to\n the other Sections. Senate Bill 140 would appropriate more\nmoney ($2,000,000.00) for construction of a negro university\n than the entire University Fund produced last year. It would\n appropriate $500,000.00 per year for maintenance and opera-\n tion, a sum in excess of one-fourth of the total present an-\n nual revenue from the University Fund. It is obvious that\n this is more money than a constitutional Negro College or\nBranch would ever receive if confined to a share of the Uni-\n versity Fund for its existence. Therefore, financially, far\n greater protection is given the statutory university under\n Senate Bill 140 than it would receive as a constitutional\nBranch under Section 14.\n     The only possible remaining financial argument is that\nthe University and its branches for white students (Main\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 21\n\n\nUniversity, Medical School, and ~A. & M.) are using income from\nthe available fund,'part of which was intended for negroes, and\nthat the Fund,may become so great in the ,futurethat it would\nadequately finance all the constitutional branches (including a\nnegro branch) ,when and if the general revenue should ever be in-\nsufficient. Morally .this does.sound unfair, but legally the\nanswer is both fair and moral. .To.the extent of every dollar\nintended and needed for negro~education out of the University\nFund but actually used for white schools, the Legislature has\nbeen appropriating from the general revenue an equal amount for\nPrairie View, and now seeks to appropriate an even greater amount\nfor a Negro University of the first class. When the day comes\nthat the University Fund has so much revenue that it can ade-\nqsately maintain and support the present constitutional schools\n2nd a Negro University, that may be the time when the Legisla-\nture will deem it practicable to establish a Negro College or\nSranch University under Section 14. Unless changed or re-\nTealed, Section 14 will remain for future use and needs if\nthey should 'arise, and nothing done in connection with Senate\nXl1 140 will.have any effect upon presentsor future rights of\nnegro citizens accorded thereby.\n     The second objection made to 'a statutory university, under\nthe requirement of equal protection of laws, is that a statu-\ntory school lacks the guarantee of permanence that is enjoyed\nby the constitutional schools; that equal .protectionfrom aban-\ndonment and change now afforded the constitutional white univer-\nsity and its branches would not be.afforded the statutory negro\nuniversity. This argument has apparent merit. It is not an ob-\njection that would make Senate Bill 140 unconstitutional, but\nit may be used as persuasive argument against the constitution-\nality of a system of separate schools which gives greater pro-\ntection to the legal existence of the university.for whites and\nits branches than to the university for negroes.\n      It is believed that there is enough merit in this last ob-\n jection to warrant your consideration of a constitutional amend-\n ment recognizing the university which may be established by Sen-\n ate Bill 140 as a constitutional university for negroes and\n giving the term of its existence the same guarantee as that now\n afforded the Main University for white students. Such amend-\n ment would necessitate no delay in consideration of Senate Bill\n 140. It could be submitted and voted upon after passage of Sen-\n ate Bill 140, simply giving constitutional approval and recog-\nnition to the new university created by Senate Bill 140.\n     In this connection, considering the past, present, and\nprospective impossibilities and discrimination of Section 14\n\fHon. George Moffett - Page 22\n\n\nof Article VII of our Texas Constitution, you may wish to con-\nsider the advisability of repealing or amending that Section\nby substituting therefor the amendment suggested above and\nsubstituting financial provisions as contemplated by Senate\nBill 140 in place of participation in an already inadequate\nPermanent University Fund. If such financial provisions are\nat least equal to any anticipated share for negroes from the\nUniversity Fund, this would forever end the contentions now\nbeing made in the courts and public forum against a statu-\ntory university.\n          CONCLUSION ON U. S. CONSTITDTIONAL PROVISIORS\n     As indicated above, it is the opinion of the Attorney Gen-\neral that Senate Bill 140 does not violate the 14th amendment\nto the Constitution of the United States. The State olan of\nseparate schools is valid so long as substantially equal fa-\ncilities and equal protection of the laws are afforded.\n     A decision to this effect was recently made by a District\nCourt of Travis County in the case of Sweatt vs. Painter, et\nal. This case is now on appeal, and all indications are that\nit will go to the Supreme Court of the United States. Thus\nunless the 50th Legislature takes immediate action on this iub-\nject, the Supreme Court may be called upon to pass on the issue\nof separate schools in Texas without knowledge of the prevail-\ning sentiment, intention, and actual establishment of a first\nclass negro university in Texas.\n     Prompt enactment of a bill similar to Senate Bill 140\nwould actually provide what our Negro citizens are entitled\nto, and it would have a great bearing upon successful defense\nof the constitutionality of separate schools. Both of these\npropositions are of foremost importance to Texas. If the Bill\nis enacted, this office will make known its existence and ope-\nration to the courts in all pending cases.\n     In line with your request for suggestions, it is further\nrecommended that the provisions of the Bill for interim instruc-\ntion pending establishment of the Texas State University for\nNegroes be strengthened and made mandatory. The suggested\nchanges and additions have been prepared and will be delivered\nherewith.\n\fHon.
