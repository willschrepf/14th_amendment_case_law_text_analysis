Before the IJ, Luchina\n\ncontended that, because of her Romani (gypsy) ethnicity, she had been persecuted\n\nin the past while living in Moldova and, if returned, she would be persecuted again.\n\nThe IJ found that Luchina’s testimony was not credible, that she had failed to\n\nprovide reasonably available corroborating evidence, and that she did not establish\n\neither past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution. Luchina appealed the\n\nIJ’s decision to the BIA, but, significantly, she did not challenge the IJ’s findings\n\nas to her credibility or to the need for corroborating evidence. The BIA affirmed\n\nand adopted the IJ’s decision.\n\n      In her petition for review before this Court, Luchina challenges each aspect\n\nof the IJ’s decision. She contends that the adverse credibility determination was\n\nnot supported by specific, cogent reasons, that the IJ made unreasonable demands\n\nfor corroborating evidence, and that the evidence she produced was sufficient to\n\nshow both past persecution and a likelihood of future persecution on account of her\n\nethnicity. However, because she did not challenge before the BIA the findings as\n\nto her credibility and to the need for corroboration, we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\nthese arguments on appeal. And because these findings are dispositive as to her\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                Case: 15-15069       Date Filed: 05/09/2017       Page: 3 of 24\n\n\nclaim of past persecution, we deny the petition as to this claim. With regard to\n\nLuchina’s claim of future persecution, substantial evidence in the record supports\n\nthe IJ’s determination that there was not a clear probability that Luchina would\n\nsuffer persecution if returned to Moldova. Accordingly, we dismiss in part and\n\ndeny in part the petition for review.\n\n                                       I. Background\n\n       Luchina is a native and citizen of Moldova who entered the United States in\n\nMay 2009 with authorization to remain until September 2009. In August 2011, the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) served her with a notice to appear,\n\ncharging that she was removable for having overstayed her visa.\n\n       Luchina conceded removability and, in October 2013, Luchina filed an\n\napplication for withholding of removal. 1            Luchina claimed that, as an ethnic\n\nRomani in Moldova, she had faced discrimination, beatings, and threats by both\n\ngovernment agents and Moldovan citizens. She feared being harassed, raped,\n\nabused, or killed if she returned to Moldova.\n\nA.     Luchina’s Application and Supporting Evidence\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          Luchina also applied for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n(“CAT”), but she does not challenge the agency’s denial of CAT relief in this petition for review.\nAccordingly, we deem Luchina’s claim for CAT relief abandoned. Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian\nIns. Co., 739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir. 2014) (issues not briefed on appeal are abandoned).\n                                                3\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 4 of 24\n\n\n      At the merits hearing on her application in April 2014, Luchina, represented\n\nby counsel, testified primarily through an interpreter. We first summarize this\n\ntestimony before discussing the other evidence she submitted.\n\n      Luchina was born in 1988 in a village on the eastern side of Moldova near\n\nthe border with Transnistria, a breakaway region of ambiguous legal status.\n\nLuchina was considered to be of Romani ethnicity because her father is Roma,\n\nwhile her mother is Moldovan. Luchina’s village was small, so everyone knew\n\nthat she and her father were Roma, and people in her village used derogatory\n\nnames towards her.\n\n      In the early 1990s, when she was five or six years old, Luchina and some\n\nother children went to a river near the border with Transnistria where Moldovan\n\nmilitary personnel were present. One of the soldiers picked her up and threw her\n\ninto the river, stating, “Even if she’s going to drown, there’s not much of a loss.\n\nOne gypsy more, one gypsy less, that doesn’t count.” She did not know how to\n\nswim, but she was able to make it back to the bank of the river. On other\n\noccasions, military personnel would take her bicycle from her, push her to the\n\nground, and spit on her. Luchina explained that the soldiers knew her ethnicity\n\nbecause they interacted with the villagers and because her physical appearance and\n\nclothing made her recognizable as Roma anywhere in Moldova.\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f             Case: 15-15069       Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 5 of 24\n\n\n      In primary school, other kids often would push Luchina around, drag her by\n\nher hair, trip her, and kick her after she fell, even though her teacher at the time\n\nwas a family friend who tried to protect her. When she transferred to middle\n\nschool, her teacher placed her in the last desk in the class because she was tall and\n\na gypsy, and she would be punished if she tried to talk to her classmates. Her\n\nparents complained about the teacher’s treatment, and Luchina was transferred to a\n\ndifferent class because it had the fewest students in it. Also, when she was in\n\nseventh grade, a classmate kicked her in the head during a game. Luchina and her\n\nparents complained to the director of the school and her teacher, but the other child\n\nwas not disciplined in any way.\n\n      In May 2003, Luchina was attacked by a police officer while participating in\n\na 5K run with her classmates. As the class passed by a police station, one of the\n\nofficers, whom Luchina identified by name, grabbed her by the hair, threw her to\n\nthe ground, and began kicking her repeatedly. The officer hit or kicked her more\n\nthan five times, fracturing her collarbone, and then grabbed her from the ground\n\nand threw her into the crowd of her classmates. The officer claimed that he had the\n\nfull right to do that to her because she was nobody. The officer said a slur that,\n\naccording to Luchina, roughly translated to “gypsy throwing,” “dirty blood,” or\n\n“second-grade human being.” When she tried to file a police report, she was told\n\nthat she was young, would heal, and should just go home.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 6 of 24\n\n\n      Luchina attended the Technical University of Moldova in the capital city of\n\nChisinau. While in a park in Chisinau in December 2006, Luchina was approached\n\nby two police officers who were on patrol.        The officers checked Luchina’s\n\ndocuments and then proceeded to beat her “quite severely,” causing big bruises on\n\nthe side of her body. The officers said that “dirty gypsies” had no place in the city\n\nand that she should go back to her village and milk cows. She reported the\n\nincident but she did not have the officers’ names, so the case was closed.\n\nLuchina’s mother tried but was unable to obtain the police report.\n\n      In August 2008, a Moldovan SWAT team raided her family’s house in\n\nsearch of guns left over from the 1992 war with Transnistria. The SWAT officers\n\nsaid that her family, as gypsies, must have something hidden because gypsies\n\nusually did. She stated that the officers hit her father and shut her and her brother\n\nin a storage shed near the house. After the raid, Luchina’s father was fined $500\n\nbecause the officers claimed to have found a bullet casing.\n\n      Luchina entered the United States in May 2009 on a J-1 non-immigrant\n\nvisitor visa. She was arrested in February 2011 and went to trial for participating\n\nin a prostitution ring. She was acquitted on all charges, but she made the news\n\nback in Moldova. In December 2013, her brother was beaten up by an officer of\n\nthe village who said it would not be good for Luchina to come back if she were a\n\n“dirty gypsy prostitute.” Later, her father was beaten up by the same officer.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 7 of 24\n\n\n      Luchina stated that relocation within Moldova would not make much sense,\n\nbecause the country was small, the people were all the same, and she would not be\n\nable to hide. She feared that someone would kill her if she returned.\n\n      In addition to her own testimony, Luchina submitted the U.S. Department of\n\nState’s 2013 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Moldova (“State\n\nDepartment report”), a Roma National Center report on Roma rights in Moldova,\n\nand a BBC News article that described an Amnesty International report. She also\n\nsubmitted her birth certificate, which states that she is Roma gypsy.\n\n      The State Department report stated that the Roma were one of the most\n\nvulnerable minority groups in the country and often were subject to social\n\nmarginalization and societal discrimination, including denial of medical services\n\nand discrimination in the job market. According to the report, the Roma had lower\n\nlevels of education, more limited access to healthcare, and higher rates of\n\nunemployment.      Further, the report noted that, consistent with Luchina’s\n\ntestimony, hazing and segregation of Roma students were problems in Moldovan\n\nschools.   The report stated that the government had approved a decision to\n\nestablish mediators within Roma communities who could improve communication,\n\nmediate disputes, and facilitate access to public services for the Roma.\n\n      The Roma National Center report likewise described a range of hardships\n\nsuffered by Roma gypsies in Moldova, including: low levels of employment;\n\n\n                                          7\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 8 of 24\n\n\ninadequate housing; low scores on health indicators; inadequate social policies and\n\nhigh dependence on state assistance; discriminatory attitudes among teachers; and\n\ndiscrimination, hostility, and abusive behavior by law enforcement. The report\n\nalso noted that the Moldovan Constitution established the principle of equality\n\nunder the law without distinction to race, nationality, ethnic origin, or language,\n\nand that the government had made some legislative efforts to combat\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n      The Amnesty International report described in the BBC News article called\n\ndiscrimination against the Roma in Europe “shocking” and found that racially\n\nmotivated crimes against the Roma were widespread. But the report also found\n\nthat governments throughout Europe had made efforts to improve the social\n\ninclusion of the Roma.\n\nB.    The IJ’s Decision\n\n      The IJ denied Luchina’s application for withholding of removal and ordered\n\nher removed to Moldova. After summarizing Luchina’s testimony, the IJ made an\n\nadverse credibility determination.   The IJ stated that there were “significant\n\ninternal inconsistencies” in her testimony but gave just one clear example.\n\nSpecifically, the IJ found that Luchina’s testimony was inconsistent about whether\n\nthe injury she suffered in 2003 was to her arm or her collarbone. The IJ also\n\ndiscounted Luchina’s testimony because the connection to her ethnicity for some\n\n\n                                        8\n\f               Case: 15-15069        Date Filed: 05/09/2017      Page: 9 of 24\n\n\nof the later attacks, “particularly the most recent ones,” was supplied only after her\n\nattorney asked her leading questions. Finally, the IJ suggested that the lack of\n\nevidence corroborating Luchina’s testimony, such as letters from family members,\n\nmedical records, or Moldovan news articles regarding her prostitution arrest,\n\nundermined her credibility.\n\n       The IJ went on to conclude that Luchina’s claim of past persecution still\n\nwould be denied even if her testimony were credible.2 The IJ found that the\n\nmistreatment Luchina described was not severe enough to qualify under the\n\nstandard for “persecution.” The IJ determined that the past events discussed in\n\nLuchina’s testimony “were relatively minor except for the broken arm.”\n\nAcknowledging that being thrown into a river could potentially be fatal, the IJ\n\nfound that, in light of Luchina’s “scarce testimony” about this event, it was\n\ndifficult to tell how serious the act was. Regarding the abuse she suffered from her\n\nclassmates in school, the IJ found that “the teachers were willing to help her” and\n\nthat she had been moved to a more favorable class when she complained about\n\nmistreatment. Apparently referencing Luchina’s encounter with police officers in\n\nthe capital city of Chisinau, the IJ found that this was a “relatively minor” incident\n\ncausing only “some bruises.” Moreover, the IJ stated, Luchina did not describe\n\n       2\n          The IJ also appears to have found that Luchina’s testimony failed to establish a nexus,\nor “tie-in,” between the past incidents and her Roma ethnicity. But, assuming her credibility,\nLuchina’s testimony established a nexus between the attacks and her ethnicity for the vast\nmajority of incidents, even if there was some doubt as to a few of them.\n                                               9\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 10 of 24\n\n\nany additional incidents after the 2008 SWAT raid, apart from the attacks on her\n\nbrother and father, which appeared to be tied to her arrest for prostitution, not her\n\nethnicity.\n\n      The IJ also concluded that Luchina had not met her burden of establishing\n\nfuture persecution. Giving great weight to the State Department report, which the\n\nIJ found consistent with the other reports submitted by Luchina, the IJ stated that\n\nthere was widespread discrimination in Moldova against the Roma, who were\n\namong the most vulnerable minorities in Moldova and often subjected to social\n\nmarginalization and discrimination.       But the IJ found that the level of\n\ndiscrimination did not amount to a pattern or practice of persecution in which the\n\ngovernment was complicit, nor did the evidence show that the government was\n\nunwilling or unable to protect Luchina. The IJ noted that the country-conditions\n\nevidence indicated that the government had taken steps to improve relations\n\nbetween Roma communities and local public authorities, and that there was\n\nnational legislation prohibiting discrimination. The IJ further explained that he\n\n“d[id] not doubt that there is discrimination and life may not be pleasant there, but\n\nit does not rise to the level of persecution as described in the Eleventh Circuit.”\n\nThe fact that her family has continued to live in Moldova since at least 2003\n\n“without incident,” other than the one incident in 2008 involving the search of their\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 11 of 24\n\n\nhome for weapons and ammunition, was “evidence that she could return there,” the\n\nIJ concluded.\n\n      Noting that it was Luchina’s burden to show by “clear probability that her\n\nlife would be threatened on account of one of the five protected grounds,” the IJ\n\nfound that Luchina had not carried her burden to establish withholding under the\n\nAct “due to her lack of credibility, her testimony, which was not detailed or\n\nspecific, including the fact that there was a lack of nexus to her Roma origins until\n\nlet on by her attorney, her lack of corroboration, [and] the long time that her family\n\nhas lived there without significant harm.”\n\n      Luchina appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA, contending that her testimony\n\nand the country-conditions evidence were sufficient to establish both past\n\npersecution and future persecution.      The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ’s\n\ndecision and dismissed Luchina’s appeal, stating that Luchina had “not pointed to a\n\nclear factual or legal error in the Immigration Judge’s decision beyond stating that\n\nshe ha[d] met her respective burden of proof.” Luchina now petitions this Court\n\nfor review of the denial of her application for withholding of removal.\n\n                              II. Standards of Review\n\n      We review only the BIA’s decision except to the extent that the BIA\n\nexpressly adopts the IJ’s opinion or reasoning. Seck v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 663 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f             Case: 15-15069      Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 12 of 24\n\n\n1356, 1364 (11th Cir. 2011). Here, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ’s decision,\n\nso we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ.\n\n      We     review    factual    determinations,     including   adverse   credibility\n\ndeterminations, under the substantial evidence test. Xiu Ying Wu v. U.S. Att’y\n\nGen., 712 F.3d 486, 492–93 (11th Cir. 2013). “Under that standard, we must\n\naffirm if the [agency’s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.” Id. at 492 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).        We “view the record evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the agency’s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nthat decision.” Adefemi v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004) (en\n\nbanc). Findings of fact may be reversed only when the record compels a contrary\n\nconclusion; “the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not\n\nenough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.” Id.\n\n      We review our subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v.\n\nU.S. Att’y Gen., 321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir. 2003). We are obligated to inquire\n\ninto our subject-matter jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. Lenis v. U.S. Att’y\n\nGen., 525 F.3d 1291, 1292 (11th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                    III. Discussion\n\n      To be eligible for withholding of removal under the INA, the applicant must\n\nshow that her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of\n\n\n                                          12\n\f               Case: 15-15069      Date Filed: 05/09/2017       Page: 13 of 24\n\n\nremoval on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b). The applicant bears the\n\nburden of showing that she would more likely than not be persecuted or tortured\n\nupon return to her country. Mendoza v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th\n\nCir. 2003). This burden may be met in two ways: (1) establishing past persecution\n\nin her country based on a protected ground, which creates a rebuttable presumption\n\nof future persecution or (2) demonstrating a future threat to her life or freedom in\n\nher country based on a protected ground. Tan v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 446 F.3d 1369,\n\n1375 (11th Cir. 2006); Sanchez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.\n\n2004); see 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).\n\n       In determining whether an applicant has satisfied her burden of proof, the IJ\n\nmust “weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record.” 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).3 An applicant’s testimony alone may establish her claim for\n\nwithholding of removal, but only if it is credible and persuasive, and it references\n\nspecific facts that are sufficient to show that she is a refugee.                     8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).     Conversely, a denial of withholding of removal can be\n\nsupported solely by an adverse credibility determination when the applicant fails to\n\nproduce corroborating evidence. Xiu Ying Wu, 712 F.3d at 493\n\n       3\n         The standards for evaluating evidence and credibility in asylum cases, 8 U.S.C. § 1158,\nalso apply to applications for withholding of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(C)\n(incorporating § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii)–(iii)); see also Niftaliev v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 504 F.3d 1211,\n1215 (11th Cir. 2007).\n                                              13\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 14 of 24\n\n\n      If the IJ determines that an applicant is not credible, “the IJ must make an\n\nexplicit adverse credibility finding and offer ‘specific, cogent reasons’ for the\n\nfinding.” Shkambi v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 584 F.3d 1041, 1049 (11th Cir. 2009). Once\n\nan adverse credibility determination is made, the applicant must demonstrate that\n\nthe finding was not supported by “specific, cogent reasons” or was not based on\n\nsubstantial evidence. Id.\n\n      Where the IJ determines that the applicant should provide evidence that\n\ncorroborates otherwise credible testimony, the applicant must provide such\n\nevidence unless she cannot reasonably obtain it. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).\n\nA failure to provide reasonably available corroborating evidence may lead to a\n\nfinding that the applicant failed to meet her burden of proof. See id.\n\nA.    Adverse Credibility Determination\n\n      Luchina first challenges the IJ’s adverse credibility determination.     She\n\ncontends that the three reasons offered by the IJ in support of that determination—\n\n(1) “significant internal inconsistencies” in her testimony, (2) leading questions\n\nfrom her attorney about the nexus to her ethnicity for some of the attacks, and (3)\n\nthe lack of corroborating evidence—are not “specific, cogent reasons” supported\n\nby substantial evidence in the record.\n\n      Luchina asserts that the one inconsistency in her testimony identify by the\n\nIJ—whether the police officer fractured her “arm” or her “collarbone”—was\n\n\n                                         14\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 15 of 24\n\n\nimmaterial given that she testified through an interpreter, she clarified her\n\ntestimony by pointing to the location of the fracture, and she was never asked to\n\nexplain the purported inconsistency. Additionally, Luchina contends that her\n\nattorney’s supposed leading questions did not provide a cogent reason for the\n\nadverse finding because the vast majority of her testimony established the nexus to\n\nher ethnicity without assistance, the leading question on one occasion actually\n\ncame from the IJ, and the IJ never adequately admonished her attorney to avoid\n\nasking such questions. Finally, Luchina argues that the lack of corroborating\n\nevidence alone is not a sufficient basis to make an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination because such a finding is inconsistent with the standard that\n\nuncorroborated testimony may be sufficient to meet her burden of proof.\n\n      The problem with these arguments, however, is that Luchina never raised\n\nthem or anything like them before the BIA. Petitioners challenging a final order of\n\nremoval must exhaust “all administrative remedies available to [them] as of right.”\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1). And “we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a\n\npetition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted [her] administrative\n\nremedies with respect thereto.” Amaya–Artunduaga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 463 F.3d\n\n1247, 1250–51 (11th Cir. 2006). That means that where, as here, a petitioner “fails\n\nto challenge an adverse credibility determination in [her] appeal to the BIA, we\n\nlack jurisdiction to consider such a challenge in [her] petition for review.” Id.\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 16 of 24\n\n\n      In order to exhaust a claim before the BIA, the petitioner must raise the\n\n“core issue” before the BIA and present “any discrete arguments he relies on in\n\nsupport of that claim.” Jeune v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 810 F.3d 792, 800 (11th Cir.\n\n2016).   “While exhaustion does not require a petitioner to use precise legal\n\nterminology or provide well-developed arguments to support his claim, it does\n\nrequire that the petitioner provide information sufficient to enable the BIA to\n\nreview and correct any errors below.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThus, a petitioner must present more than unadorned, conclusory statements and\n\n“must do more than make a passing reference to an issue.”                Id.   “These\n\nrequirements further the purpose of exhaustion: to give the agency a full\n\nopportunity to consider the petitioner’s claim and to compile a record that will be\n\nadequate for future judicial review.” Id.; see Indrawati v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 779\n\nF.3d 1284, 1298 (11th Cir. 2015) (“Unless a petitioner raises a purely legal\n\nquestion, the BIA cannot review and correct errors without the petitioner first\n\nproviding her argument’s relevant factual underpinnings.”).\n\n      Here, Luchina failed to challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility determination\n\nin both her notice of appeal and brief before the BIA. Her brief to the BIA makes\n\ntwo passing, contradictory references to the adverse credibility determination.\n\nCompare Administrative Record at 16 (“In his oral decision the Immigration Judge\n\nfound that Respondent’s testimony was not credible.”), with Administrative Record\n\n\n                                        16\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 17 of 24\n\n\nat 22 (“Nowhere in his decision did the Immigration Judge state that Respondent’s\n\ntestimony was not credible.”).     Her brief then characterizes her testimony as\n\n“credible” and argues that it was sufficient, along with the other record evidence,\n\nto establish both past and future persecution on account of her ethnicity. But the\n\nbrief fails to address the reasons given by the IJ for making the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination or whether those reasons were supported by the evidence. As a\n\nresult, the BIA never had an opportunity to consider the “relevant factual\n\nunderpinnings” of the arguments she raises in her briefing to this Court. See\n\nIndrawati, 779 F.3d at 1298. Accordingly, we conclude that Luchina’s conclusory\n\nand passing references to her credibility and the IJ’s credibility finding are\n\ninsufficient to her current challenge to the IJ’s adverse credibility determination.\n\nSee Jeune, 810 F.3d at 801 (“We therefore conclude that the conclusory statement\n\nin Petitioner’s notice of appeal indicating that he had suffered past persecution ‘as\n\na gay man’ was insufficient to exhaust (and thereby preserve) the specific and\n\ndiscrete arguments that he now makes in attacking the immigration judge’s\n\nconclusion concerning the absence of a showing of past persecution.”).\n\n      The fact that the BIA sua sponte addressed the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination does not cure the lack of exhaustion. Amaya-Artuanduaga, 463 F.3d\n\nat 1250. Reviewing issues that the BIA addresses sua sponte still frustrates the\n\npurposes of exhaustion. See id. at 1250–51. For instance, in this case, the BIA\n\n\n                                         17\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 18 of 24\n\n\naddressed the credibility determination only in generic and vague terms. The BIA\n\nwas not presented with, and we do not know how it would have resolved, the\n\nspecific arguments Luchina now raises in her petition for review. See id.\n\n      For these reasons, we are constrained to conclude that Luchina failed to\n\nexhaust her challenge to the adverse credibility determination by raising the issue\n\nbefore the BIA. See id. at 1250. “[T]herefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider it\n\nunder the clear dictates of circuit precedent.” Id. Although the government did not\n\npress for dismissal on this basis, we have an obligation to consider our subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. See Lenis, 525 F.3d at 1292.\n\nAccordingly, we dismiss Luchina’s petition for review as to this issue.\n\nB.    Lack of Corroboration\n\n      Luchina next argues that the IJ made an unreasonable demand for\n\ncorroboration and inappropriately evaluated the corroborating evidence that she did\n\nsubmit. She notes that she provided her birth certificate as well as evidence of\n\ncountry conditions, which was consistent with her testimony about her experiences\n\nin Moldova. Additionally, she contends that she sufficiently explained the lack of\n\nmedical records and police reports.\n\n      Again, however, Luchina failed to raise these arguments in her notice of\n\nappeal and brief to the BIA. Before the BIA, she did not cite the corroboration\n\nrequirement; she did not argue that the IJ unreasonably demanded corroborating\n\n\n                                         18\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 19 of 24\n\n\nevidence; and she not contend that the IJ improperly assessed the corroborating\n\nevidence she did provide, apart from undeveloped assertions that the IJ selectively\n\nevaluated the evidence.     Accordingly, as with her challenge to the adverse\n\ncredibility determination, we must conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nLuchina’s current arguments regarding the need for corroborating evidence. See\n\nAmaya-Artuanduaga, 463 F.3d at 1250.\n\nC.    Past Persecution\n\n      Luchina contends that she established past persecution and was entitled to a\n\npresumption—which the government did not rebut—that her life and freedom\n\nwould be threatened if she returned to Moldova.           She asserts that the IJ\n\n“mischaracterized or downplayed the incidents” in her testimony, failed to consider\n\nher claims as a whole, and inappropriately placed the burden on her to show that\n\ninternal relocation was not reasonable.\n\n      However, because we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ’s adverse credibility\n\ndetermination and his finding that corroborating evidence was required, substantial\n\nevidence supports the denial of Luchina’s claim of past persecution. Luchina’s\n\nclaim of past persecution depended almost entirely upon her own testimony.\n\nLuchina offered no evidence to corroborate her account of the mistreatment to\n\nwhich she had been subjected while in Moldova, even if the country-conditions\n\nevidence was broadly consistent with her account. Accordingly, the IJ’s adverse\n\n\n                                          19\n\f              Case: 15-15069        Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 20 of 24\n\n\ncredibility determination alone is sufficient to support the denial of Luchina’s\n\npetition for review as to her claim of past persecution. See Xiu Ying Wu, 712 F.3d\n\nat 493; Forgue v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d 1282, 1287–88 (11th Cir. 2005). We\n\ntherefore do not address the IJ’s alternative determination that, assuming her\n\ncredibility, the mistreatment Luchina testified that she received in Moldova did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution.\n\nD.    Future Persecution\n\n      Finally, Luchina contends that she established a clear probability that her life\n\nor freedom would be threatened on account of her Roma ethnicity, if she is forced\n\nto return to Moldova. She contends that her testimony and the country-conditions\n\nevidence demonstrated systematic and pervasive abuse against the Roma\n\npopulation, which the Moldovan government is unwilling or unable to prevent.\n\n      “Our case law establishes that persecution is an extreme concept that does\n\nnot include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.” Shi v. U.S.\n\nAtt’y Gen., 707 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). We have held that “persecution” means something “more than a few\n\nisolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.” Sepulveda v. U.S. Att’y\n\nGen, 401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005). (quotation marks omitted). “Mere\n\nharassment does not amount to persecution.” Id. (alteration omitted) (quotation\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 21 of 24\n\n\nmarks omitted).     Thus, simple threats generally do not compel a finding of\n\npersecution. Silva v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the finding that Luchina failed to establish a\n\nclear probability of future persecution based on her ethnicity. As discussed above,\n\nthe record does not compel a finding of past persecution. Therefore, Luchina had\n\nthe burden to demonstrate a future threat to her life or freedom if she returned to\n\nMoldova. See Sanchez, 392 F.3d at 437. She could meet that burden in two ways:\n\nshowing (1) “that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out\n\nindividually for persecution, or [(2)] that [s]he is a member of, or is identified with,\n\na group that is subjected to a pattern or practice of persecution.” Djonda v. U.S.\n\nAtt’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The record does not compel a conclusion that she has made either\n\nshowing.\n\n      First, the record does not compel a conclusion that Luchina would be singled\n\nout for future persecution on the basis of ethnicity. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).\n\nThe only incidents from her testimony that suggested she might be personally\n\ntargeted upon her return were the attacks on her brother and father. But the\n\nattacker’s threat—that it would not be good for her if she returned—was vague,\n\nand the IJ found that the attacker was motivated by her prostitution arrest, not her\n\nethnicity. Cf. Djonda, 514 F.3d at 1174 (holding that verbal threats combined with\n\n\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 22 of 24\n\n\na minor beating did compel a conclusion that the petitioner suffered persecution).\n\nBesides her discredited testimony regarding past instances of persecution, Luchina\n\nidentifies no evidence that would compel a conclusion that she would be singled\n\nout for persecution based on her ethnicity if returned to Moldova.\n\n      Second, the record does not compel a finding that Luchina established that\n\nthere is a pattern or practice of persecution against the Roma in Moldova. See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2). A pattern or practice claim generally requires a showing\n\nthat there is “a systematic, pervasive, or organized effort to kill, imprison, or\n\nseverely injure members of the protected group, and this effort must be perpetrated\n\nor tolerated by state actors.” Mitreva v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 761, 765 (7th Cir.\n\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      In determining whether a pattern or practice of persecution exists, an IJ may\n\nrely heavily on the State Department country report. See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att’y\n\nGen., 577 F.3d 1341, 1354 (11th Cir. 2009). As the IJ recognized, the State\n\nDepartment report, like the other country conditions evidence, reflected that the\n\nRoma, who were among the most vulnerable minorities in Moldova, faced\n\nwidespread discrimination in nearly all aspects of civil life and were occasionally\n\ntargets of violence. Nevertheless, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s finding\n\nthat the level of discrimination did not rise to the level of a pattern or practice of\n\npersecution against all Roma in Moldova. For instance, the IJ’s conclusion is\n\n\n                                         22\n\f             Case: 15-15069        Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 23 of 24\n\n\nsupported by the fact that Luchina’s family remained in Moldova with no\n\nindication of persecution on account of their ethnicity after she left and that they\n\nwere making at least enough money to send her to school and the United States.\n\nSee Ruiz v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating that the\n\npetitioner’s claim of future persecution “was contradicted by his testimony that his\n\nson and his parents have remained unharmed in the region of Colombia where [the\n\npetitioner] allegedly was threatened”).\n\n      Moreover, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s finding that the Moldovan\n\ngovernment is not complicit in a pattern or practice of persecution. The report\n\nfrom the Roma National Center noted that the Moldovan constitution prohibited\n\ndiscrimination based on race or ethnicity, and that efforts had been made in\n\nlegislation to foster equality and combat discrimination, although those efforts\n\nfaced difficulties in practice. The State Department report described efforts by the\n\nMoldovan government to improve Roma access to public services by establishing\n\nmediators to serve Roma communities. And the BBC News article noted that most\n\ncountries and the European Union as a whole had drawn up strategies to improve\n\nsocial inclusion for gypsies. In short, the record evidence does not compel a\n\nconclusion contrary to the IJ’s.\n\n      We note that the IJ’s conclusion on Luchina’s pattern-or-practice claim is\n\nconsistent with the holdings of other circuits to have addressed similar claims. See\n\n\n                                            23\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 24 of 24\n\n\nGilca v. Holder, 680 F.3d 109, 117 (1st Cir. 2012) (holding that the record\n\nsupported the agency’s finding that there was “no universal and systematic\n\nmistreatment” of the Roma in Moldova); see also Georgieva v. Holder, 751 F.3d\n\n514, 523 (7th Cir. 2014) (upholding the agency’s finding of no pattern or practice\n\nof discrimination against the Roma in Bulgaria, despite similar evidence that the\n\nRoma were “victims of pervasive discrimination in employment, education, health\n\ncare, and housing, and are occasionally the targets of violence”).\n\n      In sum, substantial evidence supports the agency’s findings that Luchina did\n\nnot establish a clear probability that she would be singled out for persecution or\n\nthat there was a pattern or practice of persecution of the Roma in Moldova.\n\nTherefore, we deny her petition for review as to this claim.\n\n                                  IV. Conclusion\n\n      For the reasons stated, we dismiss Luchina’s petition for review as to her\n\nchallenges to the adverse credibility determination and the need for corroborating\n\nevidence. We deny the petition as to her challenge to the agency’s denial of her\n\napplication for withholding of removal.\n\n      PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f",

Before the IJ, Luchina\n\ncontended that, because of her Romani (gypsy) ethnicity, she had been persecuted\n\nin the past while living in Moldova and, if returned, she would be persecuted again.\n\nThe IJ found that Luchina’s testimony was not credible, that she had failed to\n\nprovide reasonably available corroborating evidence, and that she did not establish\n\neither past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution. Luchina appealed the\n\nIJ’s decision to the BIA, but, significantly, she did not challenge the IJ’s findings\n\nas to her credibility or to the need for corroborating evidence. The BIA affirmed\n\nand adopted the IJ’s decision.\n\n      In her petition for review before this Court, Luchina challenges each aspect\n\nof the IJ’s decision. She contends that the adverse credibility determination was\n\nnot supported by specific, cogent reasons, that the IJ made unreasonable demands\n\nfor corroborating evidence, and that the evidence she produced was sufficient to\n\nshow both past persecution and a likelihood of future persecution on account of her\n\nethnicity.

In August 2011, the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) served her with a notice to appear,\n\ncharging that she was removable for having overstayed her visa.\n\n       Luchina conceded removability and, in October 2013, Luchina filed an\n\napplication for withholding of removal. 1            Luchina claimed that, as an ethnic\n\nRomani in Moldova, she had faced discrimination, beatings, and threats by both\n\ngovernment agents and Moldovan citizens. She feared being harassed, raped,\n\nabused, or killed if she returned to Moldova.\n\nA.     Luchina’s Application and Supporting Evidence\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          Luchina also applied for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n(“CAT”), but she does not challenge the agency’s denial of CAT relief in this petition for review.\nAccordingly, we deem Luchina’s claim for CAT relief abandoned.

We first summarize this\n\ntestimony before discussing the other evidence she submitted.\n\n      Luchina was born in 1988 in a village on the eastern side of Moldova near\n\nthe border with Transnistria, a breakaway region of ambiguous legal status.\n\nLuchina was considered to be of Romani ethnicity because her father is Roma,\n\nwhile her mother is Moldovan. Luchina’s village was small, so everyone knew\n\nthat she and her father were Roma, and people in her village used derogatory\n\nnames towards her.\n\n      In the early 1990s, when she was five or six years old, Luchina and some\n\nother children went to a river near the border with Transnistria where Moldovan\n\nmilitary personnel were present. One of the soldiers picked her up and threw her\n\ninto the river, stating, “Even if she’s going to drown, there’s not much of a loss.\n\nOne gypsy more, one gypsy less, that doesn’t count.” She did not know how to\n\nswim, but she was able to make it back to the bank of the river. On other\n\noccasions, military personnel would take her bicycle from her, push her to the\n\nground, and spit on her. Luchina explained that the soldiers knew her ethnicity\n\nbecause they interacted with the villagers and because her physical appearance and\n\nclothing made her recognizable as Roma anywhere in Moldova.\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f             Case: 15-15069       Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 5 of 24\n\n\n      In primary school, other kids often would push Luchina around, drag her by\n\nher hair, trip her, and kick her after she fell, even though her teacher at the time\n\nwas a family friend who tried to protect her. When she transferred to middle\n\nschool, her teacher placed her in the last desk in the class because she was tall and\n\na gypsy, and she would be punished if she tried to talk to her classmates. Her\n\nparents complained about the teacher’s treatment, and Luchina was transferred to a\n\ndifferent class because it had the fewest students in it. Also, when she was in\n\nseventh grade, a classmate kicked her in the head during a game. Luchina and her\n\nparents complained to the director of the school and her teacher, but the other child\n\nwas not disciplined in any way.\n\n      In May 2003, Luchina was attacked by a police officer while participating in\n\na 5K run with her classmates. As the class passed by a police station, one of the\n\nofficers, whom Luchina identified by name, grabbed her by the hair, threw her to\n\nthe ground, and began kicking her repeatedly. The officer hit or kicked her more\n\nthan five times, fracturing her collarbone, and then grabbed her from the ground\n\nand threw her into the crowd of her classmates. The officer claimed that he had the\n\nfull right to do that to her because she was nobody. The officer said a slur that,\n\naccording to Luchina, roughly translated to “gypsy throwing,” “dirty blood,” or\n\n“second-grade human being.” When she tried to file a police report, she was told\n\nthat she was young, would heal, and should just go home.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 6 of 24\n\n\n      Luchina attended the Technical University of Moldova in the capital city of\n\nChisinau. While in a park in Chisinau in December 2006, Luchina was approached\n\nby two police officers who were on patrol.        The officers checked Luchina’s\n\ndocuments and then proceeded to beat her “quite severely,” causing big bruises on\n\nthe side of her body. The officers said that “dirty gypsies” had no place in the city\n\nand that she should go back to her village and milk cows. She reported the\n\nincident but she did not have the officers’ names, so the case was closed.\n\nLuchina’s mother tried but was unable to obtain the police report.\n\n      In August 2008, a Moldovan SWAT team raided her family’s house in\n\nsearch of guns left over from the 1992 war with Transnistria. The SWAT officers\n\nsaid that her family, as gypsies, must have something hidden because gypsies\n\nusually did. She stated that the officers hit her father and shut her and her brother\n\nin a storage shed near the house. After the raid, Luchina’s father was fined $500\n\nbecause the officers claimed to have found a bullet casing.\n\n      Luchina entered the United States in May 2009 on a J-1 non-immigrant\n\nvisitor visa. She was arrested in February 2011 and went to trial for participating\n\nin a prostitution ring. She was acquitted on all charges, but she made the news\n\nback in Moldova. In December 2013, her brother was beaten up by an officer of\n\nthe village who said it would not be good for Luchina to come back if she were a\n\n“dirty gypsy prostitute.” Later, her father was beaten up by the same officer.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 7 of 24\n\n\n      Luchina stated that relocation within Moldova would not make much sense,\n\nbecause the country was small, the people were all the same, and she would not be\n\nable to hide. She feared that someone would kill her if she returned.\n\n      In addition to her own testimony, Luchina submitted the U.S. Department of\n\nState’s 2013 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Moldova (“State\n\nDepartment report”), a Roma National Center report on Roma rights in Moldova,\n\nand a BBC News article that described an Amnesty International report. She also\n\nsubmitted her birth certificate, which states that she is Roma gypsy.\n\n      The State Department report stated that the Roma were one of the most\n\nvulnerable minority groups in the country and often were subject to social\n\nmarginalization and societal discrimination, including denial of medical services\n\nand discrimination in the job market. According to the report, the Roma had lower\n\nlevels of education, more limited access to healthcare, and higher rates of\n\nunemployment.      Further, the report noted that, consistent with Luchina’s\n\ntestimony, hazing and segregation of Roma students were problems in Moldovan\n\nschools.   The report stated that the government had approved a decision to\n\nestablish mediators within Roma communities who could improve communication,\n\nmediate disputes, and facilitate access to public services for the Roma.\n\n      The Roma National Center report likewise described a range of hardships\n\nsuffered by Roma gypsies in Moldova, including: low levels of employment;\n\n\n                                          7\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 8 of 24\n\n\ninadequate housing; low scores on health indicators; inadequate social policies and\n\nhigh dependence on state assistance; discriminatory attitudes among teachers; and\n\ndiscrimination, hostility, and abusive behavior by law enforcement. The report\n\nalso noted that the Moldovan Constitution established the principle of equality\n\nunder the law without distinction to race, nationality, ethnic origin, or language,\n\nand that the government had made some legislative efforts to combat\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n      The Amnesty International report described in the BBC News article called\n\ndiscrimination against the Roma in Europe “shocking” and found that racially\n\nmotivated crimes against the Roma were widespread. But the report also found\n\nthat governments throughout Europe had made efforts to improve the social\n\ninclusion of the Roma.\n\nB.    The IJ’s Decision\n\n      The IJ denied Luchina’s application for withholding of removal and ordered\n\nher removed to Moldova. After summarizing Luchina’s testimony, the IJ made an\n\nadverse credibility determination.   The IJ stated that there were “significant\n\ninternal inconsistencies” in her testimony but gave just one clear example.\n\nSpecifically, the IJ found that Luchina’s testimony was inconsistent about whether\n\nthe injury she suffered in 2003 was to her arm or her collarbone. The IJ also\n\ndiscounted Luchina’s testimony because the connection to her ethnicity for some\n\n\n                                        8\n\f               Case: 15-15069        Date Filed: 05/09/2017      Page: 9 of 24\n\n\nof the later attacks, “particularly the most recent ones,” was supplied only after her\n\nattorney asked her leading questions. Finally, the IJ suggested that the lack of\n\nevidence corroborating Luchina’s testimony, such as letters from family members,\n\nmedical records, or Moldovan news articles regarding her prostitution arrest,\n\nundermined her credibility.\n\n       The IJ went on to conclude that Luchina’s claim of past persecution still\n\nwould be denied even if her testimony were credible.2 The IJ found that the\n\nmistreatment Luchina described was not severe enough to qualify under the\n\nstandard for “persecution.” The IJ determined that the past events discussed in\n\nLuchina’s testimony “were relatively minor except for the broken arm.”\n\nAcknowledging that being thrown into a river could potentially be fatal, the IJ\n\nfound that, in light of Luchina’s “scarce testimony” about this event, it was\n\ndifficult to tell how serious the act was. Regarding the abuse she suffered from her\n\nclassmates in school, the IJ found that “the teachers were willing to help her” and\n\nthat she had been moved to a more favorable class when she complained about\n\nmistreatment. Apparently referencing Luchina’s encounter with police officers in\n\nthe capital city of Chisinau, the IJ found that this was a “relatively minor” incident\n\ncausing only “some bruises.” Moreover, the IJ stated, Luchina did not describe\n\n       2\n          The IJ also appears to have found that Luchina’s testimony failed to establish a nexus,\nor “tie-in,” between the past incidents and her Roma ethnicity. But, assuming her credibility,\nLuchina’s testimony established a nexus between the attacks and her ethnicity for the vast\nmajority of incidents, even if there was some doubt as to a few of them.\n                                               9\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 10 of 24\n\n\nany additional incidents after the 2008 SWAT raid, apart from the attacks on her\n\nbrother and father, which appeared to be tied to her arrest for prostitution, not her\n\nethnicity.\n\n      The IJ also concluded that Luchina had not met her burden of establishing\n\nfuture persecution. Giving great weight to the State Department report, which the\n\nIJ found consistent with the other reports submitted by Luchina, the IJ stated that\n\nthere was widespread discrimination in Moldova against the Roma, who were\n\namong the most vulnerable minorities in Moldova and often subjected to social\n\nmarginalization and discrimination.       But the IJ found that the level of\n\ndiscrimination did not amount to a pattern or practice of persecution in which the\n\ngovernment was complicit, nor did the evidence show that the government was\n\nunwilling or unable to protect Luchina. The IJ noted that the country-conditions\n\nevidence indicated that the government had taken steps to improve relations\n\nbetween Roma communities and local public authorities, and that there was\n\nnational legislation prohibiting discrimination. The IJ further explained that he\n\n“d[id] not doubt that there is discrimination and life may not be pleasant there, but\n\nit does not rise to the level of persecution as described in the Eleventh Circuit.”\n\nThe fact that her family has continued to live in Moldova since at least 2003\n\n“without incident,” other than the one incident in 2008 involving the search of their\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 11 of 24\n\n\nhome for weapons and ammunition, was “evidence that she could return there,” the\n\nIJ concluded.\n\n      Noting that it was Luchina’s burden to show by “clear probability that her\n\nlife would be threatened on account of one of the five protected grounds,” the IJ\n\nfound that Luchina had not carried her burden to establish withholding under the\n\nAct “due to her lack of credibility, her testimony, which was not detailed or\n\nspecific, including the fact that there was a lack of nexus to her Roma origins until\n\nlet on by her attorney, her lack of corroboration, [and] the long time that her family\n\nhas lived there without significant harm.”\n\n      Luchina appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA, contending that her testimony\n\nand the country-conditions evidence were sufficient to establish both past\n\npersecution and future persecution.      The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ’s\n\ndecision and dismissed Luchina’s appeal, stating that Luchina had “not pointed to a\n\nclear factual or legal error in the Immigration Judge’s decision beyond stating that\n\nshe ha[d] met her respective burden of proof.” Luchina now petitions this Court\n\nfor review of the denial of her application for withholding of removal.\n\n                              II.

Adverse Credibility Determination\n\n      Luchina first challenges the IJ’s adverse credibility determination.     She\n\ncontends that the three reasons offered by the IJ in support of that determination—\n\n(1) “significant internal inconsistencies” in her testimony, (2) leading questions\n\nfrom her attorney about the nexus to her ethnicity for some of the attacks, and (3)\n\nthe lack of corroborating evidence—are not “specific, cogent reasons” supported\n\nby substantial evidence in the record.\n\n      Luchina asserts that the one inconsistency in her testimony identify by the\n\nIJ—whether the police officer fractured her “arm” or her “collarbone”—was\n\n\n                                         14\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 15 of 24\n\n\nimmaterial given that she testified through an interpreter, she clarified her\n\ntestimony by pointing to the location of the fracture, and she was never asked to\n\nexplain the purported inconsistency. Additionally, Luchina contends that her\n\nattorney’s supposed leading questions did not provide a cogent reason for the\n\nadverse finding because the vast majority of her testimony established the nexus to\n\nher ethnicity without assistance, the leading question on one occasion actually\n\ncame from the IJ, and the IJ never adequately admonished her attorney to avoid\n\nasking such questions. Finally, Luchina argues that the lack of corroborating\n\nevidence alone is not a sufficient basis to make an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination because such a finding is inconsistent with the standard that\n\nuncorroborated testimony may be sufficient to meet her burden of proof.\n\n      The problem with these arguments, however, is that Luchina never raised\n\nthem or anything like them before the BIA. Petitioners challenging a final order of\n\nremoval must exhaust “all administrative remedies available to [them] as of right.”\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1). And “we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a\n\npetition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted [her] administrative\n\nremedies with respect thereto.” Amaya–Artunduaga v.

U.S. Att’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (11th Cir.\n\n2016).   “While exhaustion does not require a petitioner to use precise legal\n\nterminology or provide well-developed arguments to support his claim, it does\n\nrequire that the petitioner provide information sufficient to enable the BIA to\n\nreview and correct any errors below.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThus, a petitioner must present more than unadorned, conclusory statements and\n\n“must do more than make a passing reference to an issue.”                Id.   “These\n\nrequirements further the purpose of exhaustion: to give the agency a full\n\nopportunity to consider the petitioner’s claim and to compile a record that will be\n\nadequate for future judicial review.” Id.; see Indrawati v.

Her brief to the BIA makes\n\ntwo passing, contradictory references to the adverse credibility determination.\n\nCompare Administrative Record at 16 (“In his oral decision the Immigration Judge\n\nfound that Respondent’s testimony was not credible.”), with Administrative Record\n\n\n                                        16\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 17 of 24\n\n\nat 22 (“Nowhere in his decision did the Immigration Judge state that Respondent’s\n\ntestimony was not credible.”).     Her brief then characterizes her testimony as\n\n“credible” and argues that it was sufficient, along with the other record evidence,\n\nto establish both past and future persecution on account of her ethnicity. But the\n\nbrief fails to address the reasons given by the IJ for making the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination or whether those reasons were supported by the evidence. As a\n\nresult, the BIA never had an opportunity to consider the “relevant factual\n\nunderpinnings” of the arguments she raises in her briefing to this Court. See\n\nIndrawati, 779 F.3d at 1298. Accordingly, we conclude that Luchina’s conclusory\n\nand passing references to her credibility and the IJ’s credibility finding are\n\ninsufficient to her current challenge to the IJ’s adverse credibility determination.\n\nSee Jeune, 810 F.3d at 801 (“We therefore conclude that the conclusory statement\n\nin Petitioner’s notice of appeal indicating that he had suffered past persecution ‘as\n\na gay man’ was insufficient to exhaust (and thereby preserve) the specific and\n\ndiscrete arguments that he now makes in attacking the immigration judge’s\n\nconclusion concerning the absence of a showing of past persecution.”).\n\n      The fact that the BIA sua sponte addressed the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination does not cure the lack of exhaustion. Amaya-Artuanduaga, 463 F.3d\n\nat 1250. Reviewing issues that the BIA addresses sua sponte still frustrates the\n\npurposes of exhaustion. See id. at 1250–51. For instance, in this case, the BIA\n\n\n                                         17\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 18 of 24\n\n\naddressed the credibility determination only in generic and vague terms. The BIA\n\nwas not presented with, and we do not know how it would have resolved, the\n\nspecific arguments Luchina now raises in her petition for review. See id.\n\n      For these reasons, we are constrained to conclude that Luchina failed to\n\nexhaust her challenge to the adverse credibility determination by raising the issue\n\nbefore the BIA. See id. at 1250. “[T]herefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider it\n\nunder the clear dictates of circuit precedent.” Id. Although the government did not\n\npress for dismissal on this basis, we have an obligation to consider our subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. See Lenis, 525 F.3d at 1292.\n\nAccordingly, we dismiss Luchina’s petition for review as to this issue.\n\nB.    Lack of Corroboration\n\n      Luchina next argues that the IJ made an unreasonable demand for\n\ncorroboration and inappropriately evaluated the corroborating evidence that she did\n\nsubmit. She notes that she provided her birth certificate as well as evidence of\n\ncountry conditions, which was consistent with her testimony about her experiences\n\nin Moldova. Additionally, she contends that she sufficiently explained the lack of\n\nmedical records and police reports.\n\n      Again, however, Luchina failed to raise these arguments in her notice of\n\nappeal and brief to the BIA. Before the BIA, she did not cite the corroboration\n\nrequirement; she did not argue that the IJ unreasonably demanded corroborating\n\n\n                                         18\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 19 of 24\n\n\nevidence; and she not contend that the IJ improperly assessed the corroborating\n\nevidence she did provide, apart from undeveloped assertions that the IJ selectively\n\nevaluated the evidence.     Accordingly, as with her challenge to the adverse\n\ncredibility determination, we must conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nLuchina’s current arguments regarding the need for corroborating evidence. See\n\nAmaya-Artuanduaga, 463 F.3d at 1250.\n\nC.    Past Persecution\n\n      Luchina contends that she established past persecution and was entitled to a\n\npresumption—which the government did not rebut—that her life and freedom\n\nwould be threatened if she returned to Moldova.           She asserts that the IJ\n\n“mischaracterized or downplayed the incidents” in her testimony, failed to consider\n\nher claims as a whole, and inappropriately placed the burden on her to show that\n\ninternal relocation was not reasonable.\n\n      However, because we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ’s adverse credibility\n\ndetermination and his finding that corroborating evidence was required, substantial\n\nevidence supports the denial of Luchina’s claim of past persecution. Luchina’s\n\nclaim of past persecution depended almost entirely upon her own testimony.\n\nLuchina offered no evidence to corroborate her account of the mistreatment to\n\nwhich she had been subjected while in Moldova, even if the country-conditions\n\nevidence was broadly consistent with her account. Accordingly, the IJ’s adverse\n\n\n                                          19\n\f              Case: 15-15069        Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 20 of 24\n\n\ncredibility determination alone is sufficient to support the denial of Luchina’s\n\npetition for review as to her claim of past persecution. See Xiu Ying Wu, 712 F.3d\n\nat 493; Forgue v. U.S. Att’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76903\"><a href=\"/opinion/76903/chesnel-forgue-v-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287–88 (11th Cir. 2005). We\n\ntherefore do not address the IJ’s alternative determination that, assuming her\n\ncredibility, the mistreatment Luchina testified that she received in Moldova did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution.\n\nD.    Future Persecution\n\n      Finally, Luchina contends that she established a clear probability that her life\n\nor freedom would be threatened on account of her Roma ethnicity, if she is forced\n\nto return to Moldova. She contends that her testimony and the country-conditions\n\nevidence demonstrated systematic and pervasive abuse against the Roma\n\npopulation, which the Moldovan government is unwilling or unable to prevent.\n\n      “Our case law establishes that persecution is an extreme concept that does\n\nnot include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.” Shi v. U.S.\n\nAtt’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1235 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). We have held that “persecution” means something “more than a few\n\nisolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.” Sepulveda v. U.S. Att’y\n\nGen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76909\"><a href=\"/opinion/76909/joana-c-sepulveda-v-us-atty-gen/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005). (quotation marks omitted). “Mere\n\nharassment does not amount to persecution.” Id. (alteration omitted) (quotation\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 21 of 24\n\n\nmarks omitted).     Thus, simple threats generally do not compel a finding of\n\npersecution. Silva v. U.S. Att’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77328\"><a href=\"/opinion/77328/luz-marina-silva-v-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1237 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the finding that Luchina failed to establish a\n\nclear probability of future persecution based on her ethnicity. As discussed above,\n\nthe record does not compel a finding of past persecution. Therefore, Luchina had\n\nthe burden to demonstrate a future threat to her life or freedom if she returned to\n\nMoldova. See Sanchez, 392 F.3d at 437. She could meet that burden in two ways:\n\nshowing (1) “that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out\n\nindividually for persecution, or [(2)] that [s]he is a member of, or is identified with,\n\na group that is subjected to a pattern or practice of persecution.” Djonda v. U.S.\n\nAtt’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77907\"><a href=\"/opinion/77907/djonda-v-us-atty-gen/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174 (11th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The record does not compel a conclusion that she has made either\n\nshowing.\n\n      First, the record does not compel a conclusion that Luchina would be singled\n\nout for future persecution on the basis of ethnicity. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).\n\nThe only incidents from her testimony that suggested she might be personally\n\ntargeted upon her return were the attacks on her brother and father. But the\n\nattacker’s threat—that it would not be good for her if she returned—was vague,\n\nand the IJ found that the attacker was motivated by her prostitution arrest, not her\n\nethnicity. Cf. Djonda, 514 F.3d at 1174 (holding that verbal threats combined with\n\n\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 15-15069     Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 22 of 24\n\n\na minor beating did compel a conclusion that the petitioner suffered persecution).\n\nBesides her discredited testimony regarding past instances of persecution, Luchina\n\nidentifies no evidence that would compel a conclusion that she would be singled\n\nout for persecution based on her ethnicity if returned to Moldova.\n\n      Second, the record does not compel a finding that Luchina established that\n\nthere is a pattern or practice of persecution against the Roma in Moldova. See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2). A pattern or practice claim generally requires a showing\n\nthat there is “a systematic, pervasive, or organized effort to kill, imprison, or\n\nseverely injure members of the protected group, and this effort must be perpetrated\n\nor tolerated by state actors.” Mitreva v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791293\"><a href=\"/opinion/791293/valentina-mitreva-v-alberto-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765 (7th Cir.\n\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      In determining whether a pattern or practice of persecution exists, an IJ may\n\nrely heavily on the State Department country report. See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att’y\n\nGen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78460\"><a href=\"/opinion/78460/kazemzadeh-v-us-atty-gen/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1354 (11th Cir. 2009). As the IJ recognized, the State\n\nDepartment report, like the other country conditions evidence, reflected that the\n\nRoma, who were among the most vulnerable minorities in Moldova, faced\n\nwidespread discrimination in nearly all aspects of civil life and were occasionally\n\ntargets of violence. Nevertheless, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s finding\n\nthat the level of discrimination did not rise to the level of a pattern or practice of\n\npersecution against all Roma in Moldova. For instance, the IJ’s conclusion is\n\n\n                                         22\n\f             Case: 15-15069        Date Filed: 05/09/2017   Page: 23 of 24\n\n\nsupported by the fact that Luchina’s family remained in Moldova with no\n\nindication of persecution on account of their ethnicity after she left and that they\n\nwere making at least enough money to send her to school and the United States.\n\nSee Ruiz v. U.S. Att’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77213\"><a href=\"/opinion/77213/jaime-ruiz-v-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1259 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating that the\n\npetitioner’s claim of future persecution “was contradicted by his testimony that his\n\nson and his parents have remained unharmed in the region of Colombia where [the\n\npetitioner] allegedly was threatened”).\n\n      Moreover, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s finding that the Moldovan\n\ngovernment is not complicit in a pattern or practice of persecution. The report\n\nfrom the Roma National Center noted that the Moldovan constitution prohibited\n\ndiscrimination based on race or ethnicity, and that efforts had been made in\n\nlegislation to foster equality and combat discrimination, although those efforts\n\nfaced difficulties in practice. The State Department report described efforts by the\n\nMoldovan government to improve Roma access to public services by establishing\n\nmediators to serve Roma communities. And the BBC News article noted that most\n\ncountries and the European Union as a whole had drawn up strategies to improve\n\nsocial inclusion for gypsies. In short, the record evidence does not compel a\n\nconclusion contrary to the IJ’s.\n\n      We note that the IJ’s conclusion on Luchina’s pattern-or-practice claim is\n\nconsistent with the holdings of other circuits to have addressed similar claims. See\n\n\n                                            23\n\f             Case: 15-15069    Date Filed: 05/09/2017    Page: 24 of 24\n\n\nGilca v.
