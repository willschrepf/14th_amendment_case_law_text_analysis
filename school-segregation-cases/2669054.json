The U.S. Department of\n\n    Commerce, for instance, recently reported, for the first time since it began tracking such data, that\n\n    Americans spent more money per month at restaurants and bars than in grocery stores. 1 Of course,\n\n    Americans eat out at many other places, too-sports arenas, school and workplace cafeterias,\n\n    hotels and resorts, hospitals, and nursing homes, just to name a few. The foodservice distribution\n\n    industry supplies food and related products to all of these locations. Foodservice distribution is\n\nbig business. In 2013, the market grew to $231 billion. By some estimates, there are over 16, 000\n\ncompanies that compete in the foodservice distribution marketplace.\n\n           The two largest foodservice distribution companies in the country are Defendants Sysco\n\nCorporation (\"Sysco\") and US Foods, Inc. (\"USF\"). Both are primarily \"broadline\" foodservice\n\ndistributors. As the name implies, a broadline foodservice distributor sells and delivers a \"broad\"\n\narray of food and related products to just about anywhere food is consumed outside the home.\n\nIn 2013, Sysco's broadline sales were over      sm billion and USF's were over sm billion.\n           In December 2013, Sysco and USF announced that they had entered into an agreement to\n\nmerge the companies. Fourteen months later, in February 2015, Sysco and USF announced that\n\nthey intended to divest 11 USF distribution facilities to the third largest broadline foodservice\n\ndistributor, Performance Food Group, Inc., if the merger received regulatory approval.\n\n           On February 20, 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and a group of states filed\n\nsuit in this court seeking an injunction to prevent the proposed merger. Specifically, under Section\n\n13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC asked this court to halt the proposed merger\n\n\n1\n  Michelle Jamrisko, Americans ' Spending on Dining Out Just Overtook Grocery Sales for the First Time Ever,\nBloomberg Business (Apr. 14, 2015), http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-14/americans-spending-on-\ndining-out-just-overtook-grocery-sales-for-the-first-time-ever.\n\n\n                                                     1\n\f until the FTC completes an administrative hearing-scheduled to begin on July 21, 2015-to\n\n determine whether the proposed combination would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n\n        The precise question presented by this case is whether the court should enjoin Sysco and\n\nUSF from merging until the proposed combination is reviewed by an FTC Administrative Law\n\nJudge. The real-world impact of the case, however, is more consequential. Sysco and USF have\n\nannounced that they will not proceed with the merger ifthe court grants the requested injunction.\n\n        The proceedings in this case have been extraordinary. The FTC investigated the proposed\n\nmerger for more than a year before filing suit. Then, within a two-month period, the parties worked\n\ntirelessly to exchange millions of documents, depose dozens of witnesses, and secure over a\n\nhundred declarations. The court heard live testimony for eight days in early May 2015. Counsel\n\nfor the parties have done all of this work while exhibiting the highest degree of skill and\n\nprofessionalism.\n\n        Congress passed the Clayton Act to enable the federal government to halt mergers in their\n\nincipiency that likely would result in high market concentrations.       Congress was especially\n\nconcerned with large combinations that would impact everyday consumers across the country.\n\nThe court has considered all of the evidence in this case and has reached the following conclusion:\n\nThe proposed merger of the country's first and second largest broadline foodservice distributors is\n\nlikely to cause the type of industry concentration that Congress sought to curb at the outset before\n\nit harmed competition. The court finds that the FTC has met its burden under Section l 3(b) of the\n\nFederal Trade Commission Act of showing that the requested injunction is in the public interest.\n\nThe court, therefore, grants the FTC's motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                                          BACKGROUND\n\n I.     THE FOODSERVICE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY\n\n        A.      Overview\n\n        Defendants operate in a $231 billion foodservice distribution industry, where over 16,000\n\n companies battle daily to sell food and related products to restaurants, resorts, hotels, hospitals,\n\n schools, company cafeterias, and so on-everywhere food is served outside the home.\n\nHr' g Tr. 1324; DX-00329 at 17. The types of customers served by the foodservice distribution\n\nindustry come in all shapes and sizes. They range from independent restaurants, to well-known\n\nquick-service and casual dining chains (e.g., Five Guys, Subway, and Applebee's), to hospitality\n\nprocurement companies and hotel chains (e.g., Avendra, Hilton Supply Management, and\n\nStarwood Hotels and Resorts), to government agencies (e.g., the U.S. Department of Veterans\n\nAffairs), to foodservice management companies (e.g., Aramark, Sodexo, and Compass Group), to\n\nhealthcare group purchasing organizations (e.g., Premier, Novation, and Navigator).\n\n        The industry recognizes four general categories of foodservice distribution companies:\n\n(i) broadline distributors, (ii) systems distributors, (iii) specialty distributors, and (iv) cash-and-\n\ncarry and club stores. Customers commonly purchase from foodservice distributors in one or more\n\nof these different categories, or \"channels,\" mixing and matching to suit their needs. For example,\n\ncustomers may purchase products directly from a broadline distributor; they may contract with a\n\nbrand-named food manufacturer (e.g., Tyson Foods for chicken or Kellogg's for cereal) and use a\n\nbroadline or systems distributor for warehousing and delivery; they may use specialty distributors\n\nfor select items such as produce or seafood; or they may make their purchases at a cash-and-carry\n\nor club store (e.g., Restaurant Depot or Costco).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f        Understanding these different channels of distribution and the different customers they\n\nserve is central to the antitrust analysis that this case demands. The court, therefore, describes\n\nbelow the sellers and buyers of foodservice distribution in the United States.\n\n        B.     Channels of Foodservice Distribution\n\n                1.     Broadbne Distributors\n\n        Broadline distribution is characterized by several key features, including: (i) product\n\nbreadth and depth; (ii) availability of private-label products; (iii) frequent and flexible delivery,\n\nincluding next-day service; and (iv) \"value-added\" services, such as menu and nutrition planning.\n\n        Broadline distributors offer thousands of distinct items for sale-known as \"stock keeping\n\nunits\" (\"SKUs\") for inventory management purposes-in a wide array of product categories,\n\nincluding canned and dry goods, dairy, meat, poultry, produce, seafood, frozen foods, beverages,\n\nand even janitorial supplies such as chemicals, cleaning equipment, and paper goods. Broadliners\n\nalso sell \"private label\" goods, which are akin to \"Trader Joe's\" or \"Safeway\" brand products\n\nfound in those grocery stores. \"Private label\" products are often comparable in quality to their\n\nname-brand counterparts, but are cheaper in price. Because they are able to offer such a diverse\n\narray of products, broadline distributors market themselves to customers as a \"one-stop shop,\" by\n\nvirtue of their ability to supply most-if not all-food and related products needed by their\n\ncustomers. Customers value the breadth of product offerings and the opportunity to aggregate a\n\nsubstantial portion of their purchases with one distributor, allowing them to save costs. They also\n\nappreciate broadliners' high level of customer service, which usually includes next-day and\n\nemergency deliveries. Focusing heavily on individualized customer service, broadline distributors\n\nemploy much larger salesforces than the other channels.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f        Broadline distributors come in different sizes. The largest, by any measure, are Sysco and\n\n USF. In 2013, Sysco and USF made. billion a n d . billion in broadline sales, respectively.\n\n PX09350-236, Table 44. The next largest broadliner made less than $6 billion. Id Sysco and\n\nUSF are also the only two broadliners with true nationwide service capability. Sysco and USF\n\nhave 72 and 61 distribution centers, respectively-each with more than twice the number of\n\ndistribution centers operated by the next-largest broadliners.       Because of their nationwide\n\nfootprint, Sysco and USF are often referred to as \"national\" broadliners. Combined, Defendants\n\nemploy over 14,000 sales representatives.       No other broadliner employs more than 1,600.\n\nDefendants together operate over 13,000 trucks. The next largest broadliners have just over 1,600.\n\n        The next tier of companies are \"regional broadliners,\" so called because their distribution\n\ncapabilities are concentrated in discrete regions of the United States.       The largest regional\n\nbroadliner, Performance Food Group (\"PFG\"), is the country's third-largest broadliner in terms of\n\nsales. PFG operates 24 broadline distribution facilities, mainly in the eastern and southern parts\n\nof the country and, in 2013, earned $6 billion in broadline revenue. The next five largest regional\n\nbroadline distributors, in order of 2013 revenues, are:     (i) Gordon Food Service, which has\n\nI 0 distribution centers mainly in the Midwest, Florida, and Texas; (ii) Reinhart Foodservice, which\n\nhas 24 distribution centers, primarily in the East and Midwest; (iii) Ben E. Keith Company, which\n\nhas seven distribution centers in Texas and bordering states; (iv) Food Services of America, which\n\nhas I 0 distribution centers, concentrated in the Northwest; and (v) Shamrock Foods, which has\n\nfour distribution centers in the Southwest and southern California. These regional broadliners had\n\n2013 revenues ranging from approximately    4111 billion to 4111 billion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The last tier of broadliners have five or fewer distribution centers and 2013 revenues of\n\n less than $1.1 billion.   Many of these operate in a single locality or region, like Shetakis\n\n Wholesalers, which has one distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n        Regional broadline distributors have formed consortiums to compete for customers with\n\n multi-regional distribution needs.   The largest consortium is Distribution Market Advantage\n\n (\"DMA\"). DMA is a supply chain sales and marketing cooperative owned by nine independent\n\nregional distributors, which are also its members, including Gordon Food Service, Ben E. Keith,\n\nand Reinhart Foodservice. DMA does not own any trucks or distribution facilities; rather, its\n\npurpose is to coordinate the bidding, contracting, and operational processes of its members to meet\n\nthe needs of large customers that require a distributor with extensive geographic coverage.\n\nAnother consortium is Multi-Unit Group (\"MUG''), an alliance of 19 broadline distributors who\n\nare part of UniPro Foodservice, a larger consortium that includes distributors in different channels.\n\nAs explained later, these regional consortia have had mixed results in competing for large,\n\ngeographically dispersed customers.\n\n               2.      Systems Distributors\n\n        Systems distributors, also referred to as \"custom\" or \"customized\" distributors, primarily\n\nserve fast food, quick service, fast casual, and casual chain restaurants (e.g., Burger King,\n\nWendy's, and Applebee's), which have fixed or limited menus. Unlike broadliners, systems\n\ndistributors do not carry a large, diverse number of SKUs. Rather, their inventory profile is a small\n\nnumber of proprietary SKUs, which are manufactured specifically for the customer. For instance,\n\nthe systems distributor for Wendy's carries and delivers the food products needed for Wendy's'\n\nmenu and does not make those products available to others. As a result, systems distributors\n\ntypically provide only warehousing and transport services. They do not offer private label products\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f or value-added services such as menu planning, and they have very small salesforces, if any.\n\n Systems distributors make large, limited-SKU deliveries on a fixed, limited schedule, and typically\n\n do not offer next-day or emergency deliveries.\n\n         Some foodservice distribution companies operate both systems and broadline divisions.\n\nFor instance, Sysco operates SYGMA, a systems distribution division. SYGMA is run by a\n\n different set of executives and, for the most part, operated out of separate distribution centers. PFG\n\noffers systems distribution through PFG Customized, which is run separately from its broadline\n\ndivision.\n\n                3.      Specialty Distributors\n\n        Specialty distributors offer a limited and focused grouping of products within one or more\n\nproduct categories-typically fresh produce, meat, seafood, dairy or baked goods. Other specialty\n\ndistributors focus on a specific type of cuisine, such as Italian fare. Many customers, especially\n\nindependent restaurants, use specialty distributors to supplement their purchases from broadline\n\ndistributors because the specialty distributor offers higher quality or fresher products than the\n\nbroadline distributor or provides unique products that the broadline distributor does not carry, such\n\nas products from local farmers. Both in terms of number of SKUs and geographic coverage,\n\nspecialty distributors are typically smaller than broadline distributors.\n\n        To compete with specialty distributors, some broadliners operate specialty divisions.\n\nSysco, for instance, operates several specialty divisions separately from its broadline division. So,\n\ntoo, does PFG, which operates Roma, a specialty division for Italian food products.\n\n               4.      Cash-and-Carry and Club Stores\n\n       Cash-and-carry stores offer a \"self-service\" model of food distribution, in which customers\n\nmake purchases at the store and transport the purchased goods themselves. Club stores like Costco\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f and Sam's Club also fall within this distribution channel. With limited exceptions, cash-and-carry\n\n stores do not deliver. They also offer fewer products than broadline distributors. For example,\n\nthe largest cash-and-carry store, Restaurant Depot, only carries up t o . SKUs. Additionally,\n\n cash-and-carry stores do not have sales personnel dedicated to individual customers. Because of\n\nthese features, the prices offered by cash-and-carry stores are significantly lower than those offered\n\nby broadliners. The typical cash-and-carry customer is an independent restaurant that either does\n\nnot meet broadline distributors' minimum purchase requirements or needs to supplement its\n\nbroadline deliveries.\n\n        C.      Foodsenrice Distribution Customers\n\n        Foodservice distribution customers are a heterogeneous group. The largest customers, such\n\nas group purchasing organizations and foodservice management companies, buy hundreds of\n\nmillions of dollars of product a year, whereas a single independent restaurant buys a small fraction\n\nof that amount. Some customers choose to buy from a single line of distribution; others mix\n\ndistribution channels. Some customers demand fixed pricing, whereas others buy based on daily\n\nmarket rates. Generally speaking, however, customers can be grouped into several categories.\n\n                /,      Group Purchasing Organizations\n\n        Group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, are entities that, through the collective buying\n\npower of their members, obtain lower prices for foodservice products. GPOs negotiate direct\n\ncontracts with food manufacturers and thereby secure lower prices than a member could\n\nindividually.\n\n       GPOs do not have their own distribution capabilities. Rather, they contract with broadline\n\ndistributors for warehousing, delivery, and operational services. When a member purchases a\n\nGPO-contracted good, the member pays the broadliner on a \"cost-plus\" basis: it pays for the \"cost\"\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f of the product based on the GPO' s contract with the manufacturer, \"plus\" the distributor's markup,\n\n which is negotiated between the GPO and distributor. GPOs also contract with broadliners to\n\n allow their members to purchase products from breadline distributors (rather than from\n\n manufacturers), in which case they pay the breadline distributor both the distribution margin\n\n (markup) and the cost for the product set by the distributor. GPO members also buy from specialty\n\n distributors.\n\n         GPOs are prominent in the healthcare and hospitality industries. The largest healthcare\n\nGPOs include Premier, Novation, and Navigator. One of the largest hospitality GPOs is Avendra.\n\nThese companies annually spend hundreds of millions of dollars on breadline distribution.\n\n                 2.    Foodservice Management Companies\n\n         Foodservice management companies operate cafeterias or other dining facilities at\n\neducational institutions, sports venues, and workplaces. Like GPOs, foodservice management\n\ncompanies negotiate contracts with food manufacturers and rely on broadliners for storage and\n\ndelivery; they also purchase directly from broadliners and specialty distributors. Sodexo, Compass\n\nGroup, and Aramark are among the country's largest foodservice management companies. Those\n\nthree companies each spend approximately    ti billion annually on breadline distribution.\n                 3.   Hospitality Chains\n\n        Hospitality chains are also large purchasers. Hilton Hotels, for example, uses a system\n\nsimilar to a GPO. It has a subsidiary, Hilton Supply Management LLC, which negotiates contracts\n\non behalf of over 4,000 members to obtain food and related items at a discounted price. Other\n\nhospitality companies, such as Hyatt Hotels, purchase most of their foodservice products through\n\nAvendra, the largest hospitality GPO. Starwood Hotels and Interstate Hotels & Resorts, on the\n\nother hand, directly manage food procurement and distribution contracts for their properties.\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f Regardless of the food purchasing model, hospitality chains also buy food directly from\n\n broadliners and rely on them for their storage and delivery needs.       These companies spend\n\n hundreds of millions of dollars annually on broadline distribution. Individual hotels and resorts\n\n also buy directly from specialty distributors, as needed.\n\n                4.      Restaurant Chains\n\n        Restaurant chains come in many sizes with a wide variety of characteristics. This customer\n\ncategory includes nationwide fast food or quick service restaurants such as Burger King and\n\nSubway, each with thousands of locations in all regions of the country. It also includes regional\n\nfast casual restaurant chains such as Culver's (primarily in the Midwest) and Zaxby's (primarily\n\nin the Southeast), as well as nationwide sit-down restaurant chains, such as Applebee's and\n\nCheesecake Factory. The channel of distribution a chain restaurant uses depends, in part, on the\n\nnumber of locations and menu variety. The greater the number of locations and the fewer the\n\nmenu items, the more amenable the chain restaurant is to systems distribution.\n\n                5.     Government Agencies\n\n        Some government agencies, notably the Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, are large buyers of broadline distribution services.        Those\n\nagencies, for instance, spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on broadline foodservice.\n\n               6.      \"Street\" Customers\n\n       Customers with only one location, or a handful of locations, are referred to in the industry\n\nas \"street,\" \"local,\" or \"independent\" customers. Examples of this type of customer include\n\nindependent restaurants and resorts.     Unlike the types of customers identified above, street\n\ncustomers usually do not have written contracts with broadliners; instead, they negotiate prices on\n\na weekly or other short term basis. They also tend to diversify their purchases among multiple\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f distribution channels. Indeed, according to a study conducted by an industry trade group, the\n\n International Foodservice Distributors Association, the typical independent customer uses up to\n\n twelve different supply sources. DX-00293 at 29.\n\n II.    CASE HISTORY\n\n        A.     Sysco and USF\n\n        Defendant Sysco is a publicly-traded corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas. As the\n\nlargest North American foodservice distributor, Sysco distributes food to approximately 425,000\n\ncustomers in the United States, generating sales of about $46. 5 billion in fiscal year 2014. CompI.\n\nfor TRO and Prelim. lnj. Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, ECF No. 3 at if 24 [hereinafter\n\nCompl.]. Sysco's business is divided into three divisions: (i) Broadline (81 percent of revenue);\n\n(ii) SYGMA, which provides systems distribution (13 percent ofrevenue); and (iii) \"Other,\" which\n\nprovides, among other things, specialty produce distribution (6 percent of revenue). Id.        if   25.\n\nSysco's broadline division operates out of 72 distribution centers located across the United States.\n\nId\n\n       Defendant US Foods, Inc., is a privately-held corporation based in Rosemont, Illinois, and\n\nis a wholly owned subsidiary of Defendant USF Holding Corp.                 USF is controlled by the\n\ninvestment funds of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc., and KKR & Co., L.P. The second-largest\n\nfoodservice distributor in the United States, USF operates 61 broadline distribution centers across\n\nthe country and serves over 200,000 customers nationwide. Id.      if 27.    In fiscal year 2013, USF\n\ngenerated approximately $22 billion in revenue. Id\n\n       B.      History of the Merger\n\n       On December 8, 2013, Sysco and USF signed a definitive merger agreement, whereby\n\nSysco agreed to acquire all shares ofUSF for $500 million in cash and $3 billion in newly issued\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f Sysco equity.    Sysco also agreed to assume $4.7 billion in USF's existing debt, for a total\n\ntransaction value of $8.2 billion. The merger agreement expires on September 8, 2015.\n\n         After announcing the merger, Defendants filed a notification regarding the merger as\n\nrequired by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a. As a result of\n\nthis filing, the FTC commenced an investigation to determine the effects of the proposed\n\ncombination. The FTC is an administrative agency of the United States federal government that\n\nderives its authority from the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 41 et seq.\n\nAmong other duties, the FTC is vested with authority and responsibility for enforcing Section 7 of\n\nthe Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45.\n\n        During the FTC's investigation, and with the hope of gaining regulatory approval, on\n\nFebruary 2, 2015, Sysco and USF announced an asset purchase agreement with regional broadline\n\ndistributor Performance Food Group, Inc. (\"PFG\"), to sell 11 of USF's 61 distribution centers to\n\nPFG, contingent upon the successful completion of the merger. The 11 USF distribution centers-\n\nintended to increase PFG' s geographic footprint-are, for the most part, located within the western\n\nhalf of the country, where PFG at present has only one distribution center.         Currently, the\n\n11 distribution centers account for approximately $4.5 billion in broadline sales. PX09250-0l l.\n\nThe parties also executed a Transition Services Agreement. Under the two agreements, PFG\n\nwould acquire all assets and employees at the 11 distribution centers, all customers under those\n\ncontracts (assuming the customers consent), and the right to use USF private label products at\n\nthose facilities for up to three years.\n\n        C.       History of these Proceedings\n\n        On February 19, 2015, the Commissioners of the FTC voted 3-2 to authorize the filing of\n\nan administrative complaint in the FTC's Article I court to block the proposed merger, based on a\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f finding that there was reason to believe that the merger would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act,\n\n 15 U.S.C. § 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45. Trial before an Administrative Law\n\nJudge is scheduled to begin on July 21, 2015.\n\n        Also, on February 19, 2015, the Commission authorized the FTC staff to seek a preliminary\n\ninjunction in federal court under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act in order to prevent Defendants from\n\ncompleting the merger. The FTC filed this action on February 20, 2015, seeking a temporary\n\nrestraining order (\"TRO\") and preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo until the\n\nconclusion of the administrative trial. The FTC is joined in this action by the District of Columbia\n\nand the following states:     California, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, North\n\nCarolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (collectively, the \"Plaintiff States\"). By\n\nand through their respective Attorneys General, the Plaintiff States have joined with the FTC in\n\nthis action pursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, in their sovereign or quasi-\n\nsovereign capacities as parens patriae on behalf of the citizens, general welfare, and economy of\n\neach of their states.\n\n        On February 24, 2015, Defendants stipulated to a TRO, agreeing not to merge until three\n\ncalendar days after this court rules on the FTC's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The court\n\nentered the stipulated TRO on February 27, 2015. Defendants have since represented that they\n\nwill abandon the transaction if this court grants the preliminary injunction.\n\n        On March 4, 2015, the court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing to start on May 5,\n\n2015. The parties' counsel accomplished an extraordinary amount of work in the two months\n\nleading up to the evidentiary hearing. They exchanged approximately 14.8 million documents and\n\ntook 72 depositions. Moreover, in addition to the more than 90 industry participant declarations\n\nthat accompanied the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction, Defendants obtained 65 new\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f declarations or counter declarations, while the FTC obtained an additional 25 new or counter\n\n declarations.   During the eight-day evidentiary hearing, the court heard testimony from 20\n\n witnesses, either live or via video deposition. The parties submitted a total of 185 declarations\n\n into evidence, as well as over 3,500 exhibits and excerpts of over 70 depositions. The court heard\n\nclosing arguments on May 28, 2015.\n\n                                       LEGAL STANDARD\n\nI.      SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ACT\n\n        Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions \"the effect of [which] may\n\nbe substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" in \"any line of commerce\n\nor in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country.\" 15 U.S.C. § 18. When the\n\nFTC has \"reason to believe that a corporation is violating, or is about to violate, Section 7 of the\n\nClayton Act,\" it may seek a preliminary injunction under Section 13 (b) of the FTC Act to \"prevent\n\na merger pending the Commission's administrative adjudication of the merger's legality.\" FTC v.\n\nStaples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1066, 1070 (D.D.C. 1997) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 53(b)). \"Section 13(b)\n\nprovides for the grant of a preliminary injunction where such action would be in the public\n\ninterest-as determined by a weighing of the equities and a consideration of the Commission's\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits.\" FTC v. HJ Heinz Co., 246 F.3d 708, 714 (D.C. Cir. 2001)\n\n(citing 15 U.S.C. § 53(b)).\n\nII.    SECTION 13(B) STANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS\n\n       The Section 13(b) standard for preliminary injunctions differs from the familiar equity\n\nstandard applied in other contexts.    As the Court of Appeals explained in Heinz: \"Congress\n\nintended this standard to depart from what it regarded as the then-traditional equity standard, which\n\nit characterized as requiring the plaintiff to show: (1) irreparable damage, (2) probability of\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f success on the merits and (3) a balance of equities favoring the plaintiff.\" 246 F.3d at 714 (internal\n\n citation omitted). The court continued: \"Congress determined that the traditional standard was\n\n not 'appropriate for the implementation of a Federal statute by an independent regulatory agency\n\n where the standards of the public interest measure the propriety and the need for injunctive relief.'\"\n\nId. (quoting HR. Rep. No. 93-624 at 31 (1971)); see also FTC v. Exxon Corp., 636 F.2d 1336,\n\n 1343 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\"In enacting [Section 13(b)], Congress further demonstrated its concern\n\nthat injunctive relief be broadly available to the FTC by incorporating a unique 'public interest'\n\nstandard in 15 U.S.C. [§] 53(b), rather than the more stringent, traditional 'equity' standard for\n\ninjunctive relief.\").\n\n        Under Section 13(b)'s \"public interest\" standard, \"[t]he FTC is not required to establish\n\nthat the proposed merger would in fact violate section 7 of the Clayton Act.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at\n\n714. Rather, to demonstrate the likelihood of success on the merits, \"the government need only\n\nshow that there is a reasonable probability that the challenged transaction will substantially impair\n\ncompetition.\" Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1072 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        A trial court evaluating a demand for injunctive relief therefore must \"measure the\n\nprobability that, after an administrative hearing on the merits, the Commission will succeed in\n\nproving that the effect of the [proposed] merger 'may be substantially to lessen competition, or to\n\ntend to create a monopoly' in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act.\"' Heinz, 246 F.3d at 714\n\n(quoting 15 U.S. C. § 18). The FTC satisfies this standard if it \"has raised questions going to the\n\nmerits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful as to make them fair ground for thorough\n\ninvestigation, study, deliberation and determination by the FTC in the first instance and ultimately\n\nby the Court of Appeals.\" Id. at 714-15 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThis standard reflects Congress' use of the words \"may be substantially to lessen competition\" in\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f Section 7, as Congress' concern \"was with probabilities, not certainties\" of decreased competition.\n\nId at 713 (citing Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 323 (1962)) (other citations\n\nomitted).\n\n        Though more relaxed than the traditional equity injunction standard, Section 13(b)' s public\n\ninterest standard nevertheless demands rigorous proof to block a proposed merger or acquisition.\n\n\"[T]he issuance of a preliminary injunction prior to a full trial on the merits is an extraordinary\n\nand drastic remedy.\" Exxon, 636 F.2d at 1343 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). That is because \"the issuance of a preliminary injunction blocking an acquisition or\n\nmerger may prevent the transaction from ever being consummated.\" Id          \"Given the stakes, the\n\nFTC's burden is not insubstantial .... \" FTC v. Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d 109, 123 (D.D.C.\n\n2004), case dismissed, No. 04-5291, 2004 WL 2066879 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 15, 2004). \"[A] showing\n\nof a fair or tenable chance of success on the merits will not suffice for injunctive relief.\" Id\n\n(citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIII.   BAKER HUGHES BURDEN-SHIFTING FRAMEWORK\n\n       In United States v. Baker Hughes, Inc., 908 F.2d 981, 982-83 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the Court\n\nof Appeals established a burden-shifting framework for evaluating the FTC's likelihood of success\n\non the merits. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715 (applying Baker Hughes \"to the preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief stage\"). Under the Baker Hughes framework, the FTC bears the initial burden of showing\n\nthat the merger would lead to \"undue concentration in the market for a particular product in a\n\nparticular geographic area.\" Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 982; see also Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715\n\n(quoting United States v. Phi/a. Nat'! Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 363 (1963)) (\"[T]he government must\n\nshow that the merger would produce 'a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant\n\nmarket, and [would] result[ ] in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\f market.'\"). Such a showing establishes a \"presumption\" that the merger will substantially lessen\n\n competition. Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 982.\n\n        The burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption by offering proof that \"the\n\n market-share statistics [give] an inaccurate account of the [merger's] probable effects on\n\n competition in the relevant market.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715 (quoting United States v. Citizens &\n\n S Nat 'l Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 120 (1975)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Baker Hughes,\n\n 908 F.2d at 991 (\"[A] defendant seeking to rebut a presumption of anticompetitive effect must\n\nshow that the prima facie case inaccurately predicts the relevant transaction's probable effect on\n\nfuture competition.\").    \"The more compelling the prima facie case, the more evidence the\n\ndefendant must present to rebut it successfully.\" Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991. \"A defendant\n\ncan make the required showing by affirmatively showing why a given transaction is unlikely to\n\nsubstantially lessen competition, or by discrediting the data underlying the initial presumption in\n\nthe government's favor.\" Id.\n\n        \"If the defendant successfully rebuts the presumption, the burden of producing additional\n\nevidence of anticompetitive effect shifts to the government, and merges with the ultimate burden\n\nof persuasion, which remains with the government at all times.\" Id. at 983. \"[A] failure of proof\n\nin any respect will mean the transaction should not be enjoined.\" Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n116. The court must also weigh the equities, but if the FTC is unable to demonstrate a likelihood\n\nof success, the equities alone cannot justify an injunction. Id.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\nI.     THE RELEVANT MARKET\n\n       Merger analysis starts with defining the relevant market. United States v. Marine Bancorp.,\n\n418 U.S. 602, 618 (1974) (Market definition is \"'a necessary predicate' to deciding whether a\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fmerger contravenes the Clayton Act.\") (quoting United States v. E.J. Du Pont De Nemours & Co.,\n\n353 U.S. 586, 593 (1957)); see also FTC v. Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d 151, 156 (D.D.C.\n\n2000). The relevant market has two component parts. \"First, the 'relevant product market'\n\nidentifies the product and services with which the defendants' products compete. Second, the\n\n'relevant geographic market' identifies the geographic area in which the defendant competes in\n\nmarketing its products or service.\" Arch Coal, Inc., 329 F. Supp. 2d at 119; see also FTC v. CCC\n\nHoldings Inc., 605 F. Supp. 2d 26, 37 (D.D.C. 2009) (same). \"Defining the relevant market is\n\ncritical in an antitrust case because the legality of the proposed merger[] in question almost always\n\ndepends upon the market power of the parties involved.\"            FTC v. Cardinal Health, Inc.,\n\n12 F. Supp. 2d 34, 45 (D.D.C. 1998).\n\n        Market definition has been the parties' primary battlefield in this case. According to the\n\nFTC, the relevant product market is broadline foodservice distribution. Compl.       ~   40. Because\n\nbroadline distribution is defined by a number of distinct attributes-such as a vast array of product\n\nofferings, private label offerings, next-day delivery, and value-added services-the FTC contends\n\nthat the other modes of distribution are not reasonable substitutes for broadline distribution and\n\nthus must be excluded from the product market.\n\n       The FTC further contends that, within the product market for broadline distribution, there\n\nis another product market for foodservice distribution sold to \"national\" customers. Id   ~ 44.   These\n\ncustomers, the FTC asserts, are distinct from \"local\" or \"street\" customers in multiple respects.\n\nNational customers have a nationwide or multi-regional footprint and, because of that footprint,\n\ntypically contract with a broadliner that has geographically dispersed distribution centers; they\n\nusually make purchases under a single contract that offers price, product, and service consistency\n\nacross all facilities; and they award contracts through a request for proposal or bilateral\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f negotiations.        National customers include, among others, GPOs, foodservice management\n\n companies, hospitality chains, and national chain restaurants. By contrast, the FTC says, the\n\n typical \"local\" or \"street\" customer is an independent restaurant, which does not require multiple,\n\n geographically dispersed distribution centers; purchases in smaller quantities; and ordinarily does\n\n not have a contract with its foodservice distributor(s) as it negotiates purchases on a weekly or\n\n other short-term basis.     The FTC contends that for national customers the geographic market is\n\nnationwide. For local customers, it argues that the geographic market is localized near Defendants'\n\ndistribution centers.\n\n        Defendants counter that the foodservice distribution market cannot be sliced and diced as\n\nadvocated by the FTC. According to Defendants, the relevant market is the entire $231 billion\n\nfoodservice distribution industry, consisting not only of broadline food distributors, but also\n\nspecialty distributors, systems distributors, and cash-and-carry stores. All of these modes of\n\ndistribution, Defendants argue, compete for foodservice distribution customer spending. Based on\n\nthis market definition, Defendants assert that together, they make up approximately 25 percent of\n\ntotal foodservice distribution sales. They also dispute that there is a product market for \"national\n\ncustomers,\" asserting that such a market has been created by the FTC out of whole cloth to\n\nartificially inflate Defendants' market shares. According to the FTC, Defendants combined have,\n\nat least, a 59 percent share of the national customer product market.\n\n       A.        Broadline Distribution as a Relevant Product Market\n\n                 1.       Legal Principles Affecting the Definition of the Relevant Product Market\n\n       The Supreme Court in Brown Shoe set forth the general rule for defining a product market:\n\n\"The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of\n\nuse or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.\" Brown\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. Stated another way, a product market includes all goods that are reasonable\n\n substitutes, even though the products themselves are not entirely the same. Cardinal Health,\n\n 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46; Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. at 1074 (stating the question as \"whether two\n\n products can be used for the same purpose, and if so, whether and to what extent purchasers are\n\n willing to substitute one for the other\").\n\n        Whether goods are \"reasonable substitutes\" depends on two factors:                functional\n\ninterchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand.       \"Functional interchangeability\" refers to\n\nwhether buyers view similar products as substitutes. See id (\"Whether there are other products\n\navailable to consumers which are similar in character or use to the products in question may be\n\ntermed 'functional interchangeability.'\"). \"If consumers can substitute the use of one for the other,\n\nthen the products in question will be deemed 'functionally interchangeable.'\" Arch Coal, 329\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 119; see also United States v. E.l du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 393\n\n(1956)) (\"Determination of the competitive market for commodities depends on how different\n\nfrom one another are the offered commodities in character or use, how far buyers will go to\n\nsubstitute one commodity for another.\").           \"Courts will generally include functionally\n\ninterchangeable products in the same product market unless factors other than use indicate that\n\nthey are not actually part of the same market.\" Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 119.\n\n        As for cross-elasticity of demand, there the question turns in part on price. E.l Du Pont\n\nDe Nemours, 351 U.S. at 400 (\"An element for consideration as to cross-elasticity of demand\n\nbetween products is the responsiveness of the sales of one product to price changes of the other.\").\n\nIf an increase in the price for product A causes a substantial number of customers to switch to\n\nproduct B, the products compete in the same market. See id (\"If a slight decrease in the price of\n\ncellophane causes a considerable number of customers of other flexible wrappings to switch to\n\n\n                                                20\n\f cellophane, it would be an indication ... that the products compete in the same market.\"); Arch\n\n Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 120. Price is not, however, the only variable in determining the cross-\n\n elasticity of demand between products. Cross-elasticity of demand also depends on the \"ease and\n\n speed with which customers can substitute [the product] and the desirability of doing so.\" FTC v.\n\n Whole Foods Market, Inc., 548 F.3d 1028, 1037 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Brown, J.). Thus, substitution\n\nbased on a reduction in price will not correlate to a high cross-elasticity of demand unless the\n\nswitch can be accomplished without the consumer incurring undue expense or inconvenience.\n\nSee Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 358 (observing that \"[t]he factor of inconvenience localizes\n\nbanking competition as effectively as high transportation costs in other industries\").\n\n        Three other established principles are critical to defining the relevant product market in\n\nthis case. The first is that the \"product\" that comprises the market need not be a discrete good for\n\nsale. As the Supreme Court has made clear: \"We see no barrier to combining in a single market\n\na number of different products or services where that combination reflects commercial realities.\"\n\nUnited States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 572 (1966); Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 356\n\n(citation omitted) (finding that \"the cluster of products ... and services ... denoted by the term\n\n'commercial banking' ... composes a distinct line of commerce\"). Thus, what is relevant for\n\nconsideration here is not any particular food item sold or delivered by Defendants, but the full\n\npanoply of products and services offered by them that customers recognize as \"breadline\n\ndistribution.\"\n\n       Second, \"the mere fact that a firm may be termed a competitor in the overall marketplace\n\ndoes not necessarily require that it be included in the relevant product market for antitrust\n\npurposes.\" Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1075; Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 47 (same). That is\n\nbecause market definition hinges on whether consumers view the products as \"reasonable\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\f substitutes.\" Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46. So, for example, fruit can be bought from\n\n both a grocery store and a fruit stand, but no one would reasonably assert that buying all of one's\n\n groceries from a fruit stand is a reasonable substitute for buying from a grocery store. See Whole\n\nFoods, 548 F.3d at 1040 (Brown, J.) (\"The fact that a customer might buy a stick of gum at a\n\n supermarket or at a convenience store does not mean there is no definable groceries market.\").\n\nThus, as applicable here, the fact that buyers may cross-shop between modes of food distribution\n\ndoes not necessarily make them part of the same market for the purpose of merger analysis.\n\n         Third, market definition is guided by the \"narrowest market\" principle. Arch Coal, 329\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 120. That is, \"a relevant market cannot meaningfully encompass [an] infinite range\n\n[of products]. The circle must be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within\n\nreasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will tum.\" Times-Picayune Puhl g\n\nCo. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 612 n.31 (1953). Judge Bates inArch Coal succinctly described\n\nthe \"narrowest market\" principle in practice as follows:\n\n        The analysis begins by examining the most narrowly-defined product or group of\n        products sold by the merging firms to ascertain ifthe evidence and data support the\n        conclusion that this product or group of products constitutes a relevant market. If\n        not, the analysis shifts to the next broadest product grouping to test whether that is\n        a relevant market. This process continues until a relevant market is identified.\n\nArch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 120; see also United States v. H&R Block, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 2d 36,\n\n58-60 (D.D.C. 2011) (explaining \"the principle that the relevant product market should ordinarily\n\nbe defined as the smallest product market that will satisfy the hypothetical monopolist test\").\n\n        The critical question here, therefore, is whether broadline food distribution qualifies as the\n\nrelevant product market, or whether the product market should be expanded to include other modes\n\nof distribution.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f                    2.      The Brown Shoe \"Practical Indicia\"\n\n            Courts look to two main types of evidence in defining the relevant product market: the\n\n    \"practical indicia\" set forth by the Supreme Court in Brown Shoe and testimony from experts in\n\n    the field of economics. The court turns first to the Brown Shoe factors.\n\n            According to Brown Shoe, \"[t]he boundaries of [a product market] may be determined by\n\n    examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition ... , the product's peculiar\n\n    characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity\n\n    to price changes, and specialized vendors.\" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. \"These indicia seem to\n\n    be evidentiary proxies for direct proof of substitutability.\" Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas\n\n    Van Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 210, 218 (D.C. Cir. 1986); H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 51. Courts\n\n    have relied on the Brown Shoe factors in a number of cases to define the relevant product market. 2\n\nSee, e.g., Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1075-80; Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46-48; Swedish\n\nMatch, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 159-64; CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 39-44; H&R Block,\n\n833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-60.\n\n           The court finds that the Brown Shoe factors support the FTC's position that broadline\n\nfoodservice distribution is the relevant product market for evaluating the proposed merger.\n\nAs discussed below, an analysis of those factors demonstrates that other modes of foodservice\n\ndistribution are not functionally interchangeable with broadline foodservice distribution.\n\n                           a.       Product breadth and diversity\n\n           The most distinguishing feature of broadline distribution is its product breadth and\n\ndiversity. Broadliners stock thousands of SKUs across every major food and food-related category\n\n\n\n2\n The Brown Shoe practical indicia may indeed be \"old school,\" as Sysco's counsel asserted at oral argument, Closing\nArg. Hr'g Tr. 44, and its analytical framework relegated \"to the jurisprudential sidelines,\" see Whole Foods, 548 F.3d\nat 1059 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). But Brown Shoe remains the law, and this court cannot ignore its dictates.\n\n                                                         23\n\f in their distribution centers. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1078 (comparing SKU selections among\n\n different sales outlets). The average Sysco or USF distribution center carries o v e r - SKUs.\n\n Regional broadliners cany fewer SKUs than Defendants, but still maintain between 6,000 to\n\n 19,000 SKUs in their distribution centers. PX09350-215, Table 22. Broadliners also offer \"private\n\nlabel\" products, which are a broadliner's branded products. Sysco has o v e r - private-label\n\nSKUs, and USF has over • . PX09350-219, Table 32. This product breadth and diversity\n\nenables broadliners to serve a wide variety of customers and to be a one-stop shop, if the customer\n\nwishes. As USF's Executive Vice President of Strategy David Schreibman testified at the FTC's\n\nInvestigational Hearing: \"[W]e have such a broad selection of SKUs because that is a key\n\nconsideration of our customer base, you have to have what they want.\" Investig'I Hr'g Tr.,\n\nPX00590-006 at 24.\n\n        The other distribution channels pale in comparison to broadline in terms of product breadth\n\nand diversity.   Systems distributors cany a limited number of SKUs-usually only a few\n\nthousand-in their distribution centers. PX09350-215, Table 22. These SKUs are ordinarily\n\nproprietary in nature and used only by the customers for which they were developed, meaning that\n\nsystems products are not readily sellable to other customers. Specialty distributors also carry a\n\nlimited number of SKUs, usually for niche products-such as fresh produce, meat, seafood, dairy,\n\nor bakery items-which tend to complement broadline offerings.          As Sysco's CEO William\n\nDeLaney explained: \"We own [specialty] to create great traction with our customers, ... we felt\n\nwe had some gaps in our [broadline] product offerings, whether it was special produce, special cut\n\nsteaks .... \" Investig'l Hr'g Tr., PX00580-010 at 38. Cash-and-carry stores likewise do not have\n\nthe same breadth and diversity of products as broadline distributors. One of the largest cash-and-\n\ncarry stores, Restaurant Depot, carries. SKUs. USF's CHEF' STORE carries less than 4,000.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f PX09350-216, Table 26.       A number of customer declarants stated that cash-and-carry store\n\n products tended to be less uniform and inferior in quality to products carried by broadliners.\n\n                        b,     Distinct facilities and operations\n\n        No one entering a systems, specialty, or cash-and-carry outlet would mistake it for a\n\n broadline distribution facility. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1079 (\"No one entering a Wal-Mart\n\n would mistake it for an office superstore .... You certainly know an office superstore when you\n\n see one.\"). Broadline distribution centers are massive. The average size of a Sysco distribution\n\ncenter is over 380,000 square feet; for USF, it is over 270,000 square feet.         Some regional\n\ndistributors also have distribution centers ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 square feet. PX09350-\n\n215, Table 25.    Non-broadline facilities are generally smaller in size and cannot readily be\n\nconverted into a broadline facility or accommodate broadline customers.\n\n        Broadline facilities also have large salesforces attached to them.      Broadline facilities\n\ntypically have dozens of sales representatives, while systems distributors have few sales\n\nrepresentatives at their facilities. PX09350-215, Table 23. Cash-and-carry stores generally do not\n\nhave dedicated account representatives at all. Because the model of distribution is self-service,\n\ncash-and-carry sales representatives do not learn the individualized needs of their customers in a\n\nsystematic manner.\n\n       Additional proof that broadline foodservice distribution is a separate product market comes\n\nfrom the corporate structure oflarge foodservice distributors. Major foodservice distributors offer\n\ndistribution in other channels besides broadline, but they run those businesses separately from their\n\nbroadline businesses. See, e.g., H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 56 (observing that digital do-it-\n\nyourself tax preparation was a distinct product market from assisted tax preparation because H&R\n\nBlock ran them as \"separate business units\").        Sysco runs its systems distribution business,\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f SYGMA, as a separate division. So, too, does PFG, which runs a systems business known as PFG\n\n Customized. Sysco also runs separate specialty divisions, such as Fresh Point, a fresh produce\n\n supplier. So, too, does PFG, which has its own specialty division, Roma, which supplies Italian\n\n restaurants and pizza parlors. And USF runs a separate cash-and-carry operation, CHEF' STORE.\n\n This type of corporate structuring shows that those who run and manage foodservice companies\n\nview broadline as distinct from other modes of distribution.\n\n                            c.       Delivery\n\n          Timely and reliable delivery is critical in the food distribution industry. Unless customers\n\ncan get the food they want when they need it, their businesses are at risk of losing clients and\n\nmoney. Broadliners have the capacity-due in large part to their extensive fleet of service\n\nvehicles, PX09350-217, Table 29-to offer frequent and flexible delivery schedules to meet\n\ncustomer needs, including next-day delivery. Ample evidence shows that, for a wide array of\n\nbroadline customers-from large GPOs to individually-owned restaurants-next-day delivery is\n\ncrucial to meeting their needs.\n\n         Neither systems distributors nor cash-and-carry stores offer the same degree of frequency\n\nand flexibility of delivery as broadliners. 3 Systems distributors tend to make large, limited-SKU\n\ndeliveries on a fixed schedule. Also, systems fleets, on average, travel longer distances than\n\nbroadline fleets to make deliveries. Carry-and-carry stores, for the most part, do not deliver.\n\nRather, their primary model is self-service-that is, the customer transports the merchandise on\n\nher own. Some cash-and-carry outlets do offer delivery options. Costco, for example, offers\n\nlimited-mileage delivery from some of its stores, and Restaurant Depot leases refrigerated trucks\n\n\n3\n  There was little evidence presented about the delivery capabilities of specialty distributors, aside from the fact that\nthey have a limited geographic range of delivery. See PX00427-002 (Sodexo declarant indicating that specialty\ndistributors covered a limited geographic range); PX00594-012 at 45 (MedAssets stating the same); PX00407-002\n(Amerinet stating the same).\n\n                                                          26\n\f to its best customers.     But those programs are quite limited and cannot substitute for the\n\n comprehensive and flexible delivery networks offered by broadliners to all of their customers.\n\n                       d.       Customer service and value-added services\n\n        Another distinguishing feature of broadline distributors is their high degree of customer\n\nservice and value-added service offerings. For example, broadliners offer menu and nutritional-\n\nmeal planning services to, among others, healthcare, hospitality, and restaurant customers. They\n\nalso offer value-added services at their distribution facilities, such as food safety training and new\n\nproduct updates. Other modes of delivery do not generally offer comparable value-added services.\n\n                       e.      Distinct customers\n\n        Due in large part to the breadth of their product and service offerings, broadliners are\n\ncapable of serving a wide range of customers, including classes of customers that the other\n\nchannels cannot reach. Systems is a more efficient and cost-effective mode of distribution for fast\n\nfood and quick service restaurants. Specialty distributors can provide higher quality and fresher\n\nproducts in certain categories, but have limited product offerings and charge higher prices than\n\nbroadliners. Cash-and-carry stores are less expensive and more accessible for buyers such as\n\nindependent restaurants, but their lack of delivery service makes them unsuitable for the large\n\nmajority of foodservice customers.\n\n       These other channels, therefore, simply cannot and do not serve as wide an array of\n\ncustomers as broadliners do.      The largest broadline customers, such as GPOs, foodservice\n\nmanagement companies, and hospitality providers, cannot use systems or cash-and-carry for their\n\nneeds. They purchase only modest quantities of product from specialty distributors. Even most\n\nindependent restaurants cannot use cash-and-carry stores as a reasonable substitute for their\n\nbroadliner, even though such stores offer lower prices.\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\f                       f       Distinct pricing\n\n         Broadliners generally compete only against other broadliners on pricing. PFG's President\n\nand CEO, George Holm, who has over 37 years of industry experience, testified that systems and\n\nspecialty distributors do not significantly affect the pricing and services that PFG offers to its\n\ncustomers. Hr' g Tr. 575-76, 643. And, although broadliners recognize that cash-and-carry stores\n\nprovide lower prices, the record does not show broadliners benchmarking their prices against cash-\n\nand-carry stores or lowering prices to compete with them. To the contrary, as USF's Executive\n\nVice President of Strategy David Schreibman succinctly stated in an email comparing pricing\n\nbetween USF as a broadliner and its own cash-and-carry division, CHEF' STORE: \"In the store,\n\nwe will be competitive with                   on a similar cost model. On the truck, we will be\n\ncompetitive with broadline distributors on a similar cost model.\" PX03l14-003.\n\n                       g.      Industry or public recognition\n\n        Overwhelmingly, the evidence shows that players m the foodservice distribution\n\nindustry-both its suppliers and customers-recognize broadline, systems, specialty, and cash-\n\nand-carry to be distinct modes of distribution. See Rothery Storage, 792 F.2d at 219 n.4 (\"The\n\n'industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic' unit matters because we\n\nassume that economic actors usually have accurate perceptions of economic realities.\"). The court\n\nreceived both live and out-of-court sworn testimony from Defendants' executives; executives from\n\nother broadline distributors; officers of non-broadline companies; and customers, large and small.\n\nThey uniformly observed that these modes of distribution are distinct in the variety of ways\n\ndescribed above. In short, the industry widely recognizes that broadline distributors offer a unique\n\ncluster of products and services that is not functionally interchangeable with other modes of\n\ndistribution.\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f                        h,      Defendants' response to Brown Shoe \"practical indicia\"\n\n        Defendants do not, for the most part, contest the above-described distinctions between\n\n broadline and other channels of distribution.        Instead, Defendants contend that defining the\n\n relevant market to include only broadliners \"misunderstands consumer behavior.\" Memo ofDefs.\n\n Sysco Corp., USP Holding Corp. and US Foods, Inc., in Opp'n to Pis.' Mot. for A Prehm Inj.,\n\nECF No. 130 at 19 [hereinafter Defs.' Opp'n Br.]. They argue \"customers simultaneously can,\n\nand routinely do, choose to patronize competitors of all stripes offering fungible goods through\n\ndifferent but overlapping distribution channels.\" Id. What matters, Defendants claim, is that non-\n\nbroadliners are able to constrain a broadliner's pricing by competing for customers who are able\n\nto move their entire purchasing, or portions of their purchasing, between channels. Id. at 19\n\n(\"Whether a substitute channel is a 'comprehensive' substitute is irrelevant to that question.\").\n\nDefendants offer as one compelling example the burger chain Five Guys, which recently re-\n\nallocated over $300 million in annual business from USP to a collection of regional broadliners\n\nand systems distributors.\n\n        Defendants are indisputably correct that customers buy across channels, especially\n\nindependent restaurants. They are also unquestionably correct that some customers, particularly\n\nquick service and fast food restaurant chains, are capable of moving large segments of business\n\nfrom broadline to systems. But the fact that Defendants sometimes compete against other channels\n\nof distribution in the larger marketplace does not mean that those alternative channels belong in\n\nthe relevant product market for purposes of merger analysis. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1075\n\n(\"[T]he mere fact that a firm may be termed a competitor in the overall marketplace does not\n\nnecessarily require that it be included in the relevant product market for antitrust purposes.\"); see\n\nalso Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis ofAntitrust Principles\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f and Their Application~ 565b (4th ed. 2014) (\"[I]t would be improper to group complementary\n\n goods into the same relevant market just because they occasionally substitute for one another.\n\n Substitution must be effective to hold the primary good to a price near its costs[.]\").\n\n        Two key decisions from this jurisdiction, Whole Foods and Staples, support this\n\nconclusion. In Whole Foods, the question was whether there existed a product market for premium\n\nnatural and organic supermarkets (\"PNOS\") separate from ordinary supermarkets. The Court of\n\nAppeals' ultimate decision was fractured-each judge issued a separate opinion, leaving no\n\ncontrolling opinion from the Court. Two judges, however, concluded that PNOS is a separate\n\nproduct market from ordinary supermarkets, even though there was evidence that customers\n\n\"cross-shopp[ed]\" between the two. 548 F.3d at 1040 (Brown, J.); id. (\"But the fact that PNOS\n\nand ordinary supermarkets 'are direct competitors in some submarkets ... is not the end of the\n\ninquiry.\"') (quoting United States v. Conn. Nat. Bank, 418 U.S. 656, 664 n.3 (1974)); id. at 1048\n\n(Tatel, J.) (\"That Whole Foods and Wild Oats have attracted many customers away from\n\nconventional grocery stores by offering extensive selections of natural and organic products thus\n\ntells us nothing about whether [they] should be treated as operating in the same market as\n\nconventional grocery stores.\"). Both judges agreed that just because customers were able to buy\n\nsome categories of grocery products from both outlets-similar to how broadline customers are\n\nable to purchase some products from other modes of distribution-did not mean that PNOS was\n\nin the same product market as grocery stores. See id. at 1040 (Brown, J.) (citing testimony that\n\n\"Whole Foods competes actively with conventional supermarkets for dry groceries sales, even\n\nthough it ignores their prices for high-quality perishables\"); id. at 1049 (Tatel, J.) (\"As Judge\n\nBrown's opinion explains, this suggests that any competition between Whole Foods and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\f    conventional retailers may be limited to a narrow range of products that play a minor role in Whole\n\n    Food's profitability.\").\n\n           The court in Staples held much the same. There, the question was whether consumable\n\n    office supplies sold by office superstores constituted a separate product market from office\n\n    supplies sold elsewhere. See Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. at 1073. The court acknowledged that no\n\n    matter who sells them, office supply products-to some extent, like food products-are\n\n    \"undeniably the same.\" Id at 1075. The court nevertheless held that the sale of office supplies\n\n through superstores constituted the relevant product market. \"[T]he unique combination of size,\n\n selection, depth and breadth of inventory offered by the superstores distinguishes them from other\n\n retailers.\" Id at 1079. Those words apply with equal force to broadline distributors relative to\n\nother food distribution channels. See also Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 47 (concluding that\n\nthe wholesale drug industry \"provide[s] customers with an efficient way to obtain prescription\n\ndrugs through centralized warehousing, delivery, and billing services that enable the customers to\n\navoid carrying large inventories, dealing with large number of vendors, and negotiating numerous\n\ntransactions\").\n\n           Defendants have not convincingly distinguished Whole Foods or Staples. 4 Instead, they\n\nurge the court to look to United States v. Sungard Data Sys., Inc., 172 F. Supp. 2d 172 (D.D.C.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  In neither their opposition to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction nor their proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law do Defendants attempt to distinguish Whole Foods or Staples. At oral argument, Defendants\ndistinguished Staples based on the fact that in Staples the FTC had pricing data to show that prices were lower in\nmarkets where both merging firms were present. Closing Arg. Hr' g Tr. at 38-40. Defendants also sought to distinguish\nWhole Foods on the facts, arguing that in Whole Foods the defendants could not show that in the event of a price\nincrease consumers of PNOS could go to a standard grocery store. Id. at 40-41. But the court finds these efforts to\ndistinguish Staples and Whole Foods unconvincing. It is true that there was stronger pricing data in Staples, but\npricing data alone did not lead to the court's conclusion. The factual similarities between this case and Staples,\nparticularly the Brown Shoe practical indicia, are otherwise strong. As for Whole Foods, it is even more factually\nanalogous to this case than is Staples. If anything, the proof that other channels of distribution are not reasonable\nsubstitutes for broadline is more compelling in this case than the evidence in Whole Foods that ordinary grocery stores\nare not a reasonable substitute for PNOS.\n\n                                                         31\n\f2001), as an analogous case. There, the question was whether different types of disaster recovery\n\nservices for computer data comprised the same product market. Id. at 183. The court rejected the\n\ngovernment's product market definition as limited only to shared hotsite services because \"the\n\ngovernment's market contains an extremely heterogeneous group of customers,\" id. at 182, who\n\n\"are simply too varied and too dissimilar to support any generalizations,\" id. at 193. Here, it is\n\nunquestionably true that foodservice distribution customers are incredibly varied in their needs,\n\nbuying habits, and price sensitivities. But Sungard differs in one critical respect. The court there\n\nobserved that \"the striking heterogeneity of the market, particularly as reflected by the conflicting\n\nevidence relating to customer perceptions and practices,\" undercut the government's market\n\ndefinition. Id. at 182-83 (emphasis added). Here, that simply is not the case. Though the\n\ncustomers may be varied, the court has little doubt that the industry, from the perspective of both\n\nsellers and buyers, perceives broadline to be a separate mode of food distribution. Witnesses of\n\nall stripes had little trouble distinguishing among the different channels of distribution, and\n\nDefendants offered no evidence of any industry confusion among them. Those facts make this\n\ncase fundamentally different from Sungard. See id. at 183 (\"Customer responses were also often\n\nvague and confused\" and product definitions were \"consistently unclear.\").\n\n       Defendants also argue that the FTC's definition of broadline as the relevant market\n\nimproperly excludes other modes based on \"a small number of customers' subjective preferences\n\nfor broadline distribution.\" Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 17 (footnote omitted). But the evidence, as it\n\nrelates to broadline versus other distribution channels, is hardly selective. Defendants' own\n\nexecutives acknowledged the fundamental differences between broadline and other modes of\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f    distribution. 5 So, too, did executives of regional broadliners, such as PFG, 6 Sharnrock,7 Reinhart\n\n    Foodservice, 8 and Shetakis9 ; consortiums, such as UniPro 10 ; systems distributors, such as\n\n    Maines 11 ; and cash-and-carry stores, such as Restaurant Depot. 12 Likewise, customers of every\n\n    size recognized the differences between broadline and the other food distribution modes. In short,\n\n this is not the kind of case in which the testimonial evidence failed to demonstrate a consensus\n\n among the industry's players regarding the boundaries of the product market.\n\n                   3.       Expert Testimony\n\n           Having concluded that the Brown Shoe \"practical indicia\" support a product market for\n\n broadline foodservice distribution, the court turns next to the second type of evidence that courts\n\n consider in product market definition: expert testimony in the field of economics. One of the\n\nprimary methods used by economists to determine a product market is called the \"hypothetical\n\nmonopolist test.\" This test asks whether a hypothetical monopolist who has control over a set of\n\nsubstitutable products could profitably raise prices on those products. If so, the products may\n\ncomprise the relevant product market. See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-52. The theory\n\nbehind the test is straightforward. If enough consumers are able to substitute away from the\n\n\n\n5\n   See, e.g., DX-00319 at 32-36 (Sysco's CEO, William DeLaney, explained that systems is a \"tailored, customized\napproach to certain types of customers\" and the \"model is not to serve GPO customers\"); Hr' g Tr. 1369-70 (DeLaney\nstated that, compared to cash-and-carry, broadline is a \"value package\" that includes delivery services and menu\nconsulting); Hr'g Tr. 1452 (David Schreibman ofUSF stated that \"specialty distributors compete by having a broader\narray of products within their expertise\" that \"broadliner[s] may not have in [their] portfolio\"); Investigat'l Hr'g Tr.,\nPX00580-008-010 at 32-39 (DeLaney explained that broadline and specialty are \"two different businesses,\" whereas\nbroadline distribution includes \"a full range of products\"); Investigat' l Hr' g Tr., PX00584-060 at 239-40 (Louis Nasir,\nthe Pacific Market President for Sysco, maintained that cash-and-carry stores \"don't have the same selection\" of\nproducts and \"also don't have consistent inventory\" compared with broadliners); Investigat'l Hr'g Tr., PX00590-0l l\nat 42 (Schreibman stated that he was not aware of a cash-and-carry store that delivers).\n6\n   See PX00429-002-007; Hr'g Tr. 571-73.\n7\n   DX-00285 at 115-16, 164-66.\n8\n   DX-00295 at 16-17, 22.\n9\n   PX004l4-001.\n10\n    DX-00260 at 139.\n11\n   DX-00264 at 64, 141; PX00424-001 (Maines is predominantly systems, butl percent of2013 revenues were from\nbroadline sales).\n12\n    DX-00314 at 146-47.\n\n                                                          33\n\f hypothetical monopolist's product to another product and thereby make a pnce mcrease\n\n unprofitable, then the relevant market cannot include only the monopolist's product and must also\n\n include the substitute goods. On the other hand, if the hypothetical monopolist could profitably\n\n raise price by a small amount, even with the loss of some customers, then economists consider the\n\nmonopolist's product to constitute the relevant market.\n\n        The hypothetical monopolist test, which courts have applied, is set forth in the\n\nU.S. Department of Justice and FTC's Horizontal Merger Guidelines. See U.S. Dep't of Justice &\n\nFTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 4.1.1 (2010) [hereinafter Merger Guidelines]; H&R Block,\n\n833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-52; CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 40; Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 120\n\n& n. 7. As stated in the Merger Guidelines:\n\n        [T]he test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm, not subject to price\n        regulation, that was the only present and future seller of those products ... likely\n        would impose at least a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price\n        (\"SSNIP\") on at least one product in the market, including at least one product sold\n        by one of the merging firms.\n\nMerger Guidelines§ 4.1.1. The SSNIP \"is intended to represent a 'small but significant' increase\n\nin the prices charged by firms in the candidate market\" and is typically assumed to be \"five percent\n\nof the price paid by customers for the products or services to which the merging firms contribute\n\nvalue.\" Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.2.\n\n        As applied to this case, the hypothetical monopolist test asks: If there was only one\n\nbroadline food distributor, could it profitably raise price by five percent, or would that price increase\n\nresult in a substantial number of customers moving enough of their spend to other modes of\n\ndistribution-systems, specialty, or cash-and-carry-such that the price increase would be\n\nunprofitable? If the price increase would be profitable, then the relevant product market is broadline\n\ndistribution; if unprofitable, it means that the relevant market must include at least one other channel\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\f of distribution.       Each side presented expert testimony from economists who performed the\n\n hypothetical monopolist test but who came to different results.\n\n                             a.       Dr. Mark Israel\n\n            For its expert economic evidence, the FTC presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Israel, who\n\n received a doctorate in economics from Stanford University and now serves as Executive Vice\n\n President at Compass Lexecon, a consulting firm. Dr. Israel's testimony served two primary\n\n functions. First, he acted as a de facto summary witness, synthesizing the mass of testimonial and\n\n documentary evidence gathered by the FTC. Dr. Israel's summary of that evidence parallels the\n\n discussion in the above sub-sections, so the court does not revisit it here. Second, Dr. Israel\n\n conducted a SSNIP test, using what is known as an \"aggregate diversion analysis.\" Its purpose is\n\n to determine the amount of sales that a hypothetical monopolist of broadline distribution could\n\n lose before a price increase becomes unprofitable. See Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 160\n\n (describing the related methodology of\"critical loss analysis\"); H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 63\n\n(same). A detailed recitation of Dr. Israel's aggregate diversion analysis is necessary because\n\nDefendants challenge the basic elements of his work.\n\n            Aggregate diversion analysis has three basic steps. The first is to determine the threshold\n\naggregate diversion ratio, which is the percentage of customers that would need to stay within the\n\nbroadline market to make a price increase profitable. See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 63. This\n\nis strictly a mathematical step, with the aggregate diversion ratio a function of the subject product's\n\ngross margin. The gross margin is defined as the price of selling one additional product minus the\n\ncost of selling the additional product. 13 The second step is to determine the actual aggregate\n\ndiversion-that is, the actual percentage of customers of a single broadliner that would switch to\n\n\n\n13\n     Gross margin is calculated as follows: (Revenue-Cost of Goods Sold)/Revenue.\n\n                                                        35\n\f another broadliner after a price increase. \"Since these lost sales are recaptured within the proposed\n\n market, they are not lost to the hypothetical monopolist.\" Id. As will be seen, this step involved\n\n an analysis of Defendants' actual sales data. The final step is to compare the two: if the actual\n\n aggregate diversion is greater than the threshold ratio, then the hypothetical monopolist could\n\n profitably raise prices and the candidate market is the relevant product market. See id. In other\n\n words, as applied here, if the percentage of customers of a single broadliner who would switch to\n\n another broadliner (as opposed to another mode of distribution) in response to a price increase is\n\n greater than the percentage of customers needed to stay within the market to make a price increase\n\nprofitable, then the relevant product market is properly defined as broadline distribution.\n\n          At step one of his aggregate diversion analysis, Dr. Israel assumed a gross margin of\n\n 10 percent, a figure lower than the gross margin contained in the parties' financial reporting. 14\n\nA 10 percent gross margin, according to Dr. Israel, yields a 50 percent threshold aggregate\n\ndiversion ratio based on a formula devised by two economists, Michael Katz and Carl Shapiro. 15\n\n          Next, Dr. Israel calculated the actual aggregate diversion based on three different data sets.\n\nHe constructed the first two data sets from national and regional requests for proposals (\"RFPs\")\n\nand \"bidding\" summary information and documents produced by each Defendant to the FTC.\n\nBased on this information, Dr. Israel built a database for each company that tracked, for each\n\nbidding opportunity, the incumbent distributor, the winning distributor, and the competing bidders.\n\nPX09350-104.         Based on Sysco's RFP/bidding data, he found that, when Sysco lost a bid,\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Dr. Israel testified that the parties' reported gross margins are between 15 and 20 percent, but to be conservative he\nused a 10 percent margin. Hr'g Tr. 1004-05.\n15\n   The Katz-Shapiro formula that Dr. Israel used is L =XI(){+ M), where L is the aggregate diversion ratio, or \"critical\nloss,\" X is the price increase, and M is the margin. PX09350-055 at n.134. For his aggregate diversion analysis,\nDr. Israel used a 10 percent price increase and a 10 percent margin, for a resulting critical loss of 50 percent, i.e., .50\n= .10/(.10 + .10). Hr'g Tr. 1004-07.\n\n                                                           36\n\f broad.liner; the remaining losses were to another mode of distribution. PX09350-056. Based on\n\nUSF's RFP/bidding data, the percentage was even higher-USF lost to other broadliner-\n\nHtffl of the time.   Id.\n\n        Dr. Israel constructed his third data set from USF's \"Linc\" database. Linc is a customer\n\nrelations management tool that USF local sales representatives used until recently to track sales\n\nopportunities. The Linc database contains fields that sales representatives can complete to describe\n\na sales opportunity, including a \"main competition\" field. Dr. Israel assumed that, if USF did not\n\nwin an opportunity, it was won by the identified \"main competitor.\" The Linc database contained\n\nhundreds of thousands of observations, about a third of which included information on the \"main\n\ncompetitor.\"\n\nopportunities lost by USF (again, based on potential revenue of those sales opportunities) were\n\nlost to other broadliners. PX09350-056.\n\n       At the third step, Dr. Israel compared the aggregate diversion ratio of 50 percent to the\n\nactual diversion percentages derived from the three data sets. He concluded that, because each of\n\nthe three actual diversion percentages was higher than the 50 percent threshold aggregate diversion\n\nratio, broadline distribution was the relevant product market. In other words, Dr. Israel found that\n\nonly 50 percent of broadline customers would need to remain within the broadline market to make\n\na price increase profitable, while according to three different data sets, the actual percentage of\n\ncustomers who would remain within the broadline market (by switching to another broadliner) was\n\ngreater than 50 percent. Therefore, Dr. Israel's calculations indicated that broadline distribution\n\nwas the relevant product market.\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f                            b,       Defendants' experts\n\n          Defendants mounted an aggressive challenge to Dr. Israel's work through their own expert\n\n witnesses.      Defendants first presented Dr. Jerry Hausman, a professor of economics at\n\n Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Hausman testified, in short, that Dr. Israel's aggregate\n\n diversion analysis was wrong because (i) he used the wrong gross margin and (ii) he used the\n\n wrong mathematical formula to calculate the threshold aggregate diversion ratio. According to\n\n Dr. Hausman, Dr. Israel excluded certain variable costs from his gross margin. The actual gross\n\n margin was not 10 percent, according to Dr. Hausman, but between                   II percent and II percent.\nAlso, Dr. Hausman testified that the aggregate diversion formula Dr. Israel used was incorrect and\n\nled to an overly narrow market definition. 16 Using the proper margins and the correct formula,\n\nDr. Hausman opined, the aggregate diversion ratio is not 50 percent, but rather over 100 percent,\n\nwhich is an impossibility (i.e., more than 100 percent of customers cannot switch in response to a\n\nprice increase). Thus, he concluded, the relevant product market is not broadline, but all channels\n\nof food distribution.\n\n         While Dr. Hausman challenged Dr. Israel's calculation of the threshold aggregate diversion\n\nratio, Defendants' other expert, Dr. Timothy Bresnahan, a professor of economics at Stanford\n\nUniversity, critiqued Dr. Israel's use of the RFP/bidding and Linc data sets to calculate the actual\n\naggregate diversion.        Regarding the RFP/bidding data, Dr. Bresnahan described the data as\n\ncontrived and unreliable-a point that Defendants consistently articulated to the FTC during the\n\ninvestigation phase. Dr. Bresnahan explained that the companies do not keep comprehensive RFP\n\n\n\n16\n   According to Dr. Hausman, the correct formula is L = XIM, where L is the aggregate diversion ratio, or \"critical\nloss,\" Xis the price increase, and Mis the margin. Dr. Hausman testified that this is the more appropriate formula in\nan asymmetric market, like food distribution, which involves suppliers and customers with different costs, different\ntypes of customers, and a different mix of products. Hr'g Tr. 1960-64; DFF at 285-86 (citing to DX-05028 at 11).\nThe formula used by Dr. Israel, on the other hand, is more appropriate in a symmetric market, that is, a market marked\nby homogeneity among suppliers and customers. Hr'g Tr. 1960, 1965-66; DX-05028 at 10-11.\n\n                                                         38\n\f or bidding data in the ordinary course of business and that the information Dr. Israel relied upon\n\n was pulled together at the insistence of the FTC, in part based on employees' unreliable notes and\n\n memories. As for the Linc data, it too was flawed, Dr. Bresnahan suggested, because it is a\n\n prospective sales database, not an actual transactions database in which USF sales personnel were\n\n accurately recording wins and losses. Moreover, neither the RFP/bidding data nor the Linc data\n\n describes whether Sysco or USF lost a customer for a price-based reason or some reason having\n\nnothing to do with price.\n\n                           c.       The court's finding as to the expert testimony\n\n          Having weighed the competing expert testimonies and considered them in light of the\n\nevidentiary record as a whole, the court finds Dr. Israel's aggregate diversion analysis and\n\nconclusion to be more persuasive than that advanced by Defendants' expert, Dr. Hausman. 17\n\nDr. Israel's reliance on the RFP/bidding and Linc data sets for calculating the aggregate diversion\n\nis problematic for the reasons Defendants have identified and, for those reasons, the court hesitates\n\nto rely on Dr. Israel's precise aggregate diversion percentages. But, when evaluated against the\n\nrecord as a whole, Dr. Israel's conclusions are more consistent with the business realities of the\n\nfood distribution market than Dr. Hausman's. See Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46 (stating\n\nthat \"the determination of the relevant market in the end is 'a matter of business reality-[ ] of\n\nhow the market is perceived by those who strive for profit in it.\"' (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nFTC v.

Supp. 2d at 65 (bearing in mind the shortcomings of the\n\n expert's analysis and treating the analysis as \"another data point\" in determining the relevant\n\n market, rather than as conclusive).\n\n          The court finds Dr. Hausman's conclusion-that the actual aggregate diversion ratio is\n\n greater than 100 percent-inconsistent with business reality. On cross-examination, Dr. Hausman\n\n admitted that his conclusion meant that a hypothetical monopolist who had control over every\n\n single broadline distributor in the country could not profitably impose a SSNIP on customers,\n\n because enough customers would switch to other channels of distribution. Hr'g Tr. 2003-04. Yet\n\n many industry leaders testified either that other channels of distribution did not constrain the prices\n\ncharged by broadliners or that other channels were not substitutes for broadline distribution. For\n\ninstance, PFG's President and CEO, George Holm, testified that systems and specialty distributors\n\ndo not significantly affect the pricing and services that PFG's broadline division offers to its\n\ncustomers. Hr' g Tr. 575-76. He also testified that systems and specialty distributors were not\n\nsubstitutes for broadliners. Hr'g Tr. 573. Such evidence from industry leaders, 18 which the court\n\ncredits, contradicts Dr. Hausman's conclusion that a hypothetical monopolist ofbroadline services\n\nwould not be able to impose a SSNIP because enough customers would switch to other channels\n\nof distribution.\n\n\n\n\n18\n   See also PX00429-004-007 (George Holm, President and CEO of PFG, explaining that systems, specialty, and cash-\nand-carry distributors are not substitutes for customers needing broadline distribution); DX-00285 at 125-26 (John\nRoussel, COO of Shamrock Foods, stating that it's \"not possible\" or \"practical\" for a broadline customer to use a\nsystems distributor); DX-00260 at 139 (Bob Stewart, interim CEO ofUnipro, explaining that a broadline customer\ncannot easily switch to a systems distributor and a broadline customer's needs are different than a systems customer's\nneeds).\n\n\n                                                         40\n\f                4.      Conclusion as to the Broadline Product Market\n\n        In conclusion, based on the vast record of evidence the parties have presented, the court\n\nfinds that the FTC has carried its burden of demonstrating that broad.line distribution is the relevant\n\nproduct market.\n\n        B.      National Broadline Distribution as a Relevant Product Market\n\n        The FTC asserts that, within the broader product market for broad.line distribution, there is\n\na narrower but distinct product market for \"broad.line foodservice distribution services sold to\n\nNational Customers.\" CompI. if 44. According to the FTC, \"[ d]ue to [their] geographic dispersion,\n\nNational Customers typically contract with a broadline foodservice distributor that has distribution\n\ncenters proximate to all (or virtually all) of their locations.\" Id.   if 42.\n        National Customers typically contract with a broadliner that can provide--across\n        all of their locations-product consistency and availability, efficient contract\n        management and administration (e.g., centralized ordering and reporting, a single\n        point of contact, and consistent pricing across all locations), volume discounts from\n        aggregated purchasing, and the ability to expand geographically with the same\n        broadline foodservice distributor.\n\nId. National customers include healthcare GPOs; foodservice management companies; and large\n\nhotel and restaurant chains. Id    if 41. The FTC contends that Sysco and USF \"are the only two\nsingle-firm broadline distributors with national geographic reach and, as such, are best positioned\n\nto serve National Customers.\" Id.    if 63.\n       Defendants vigorously dispute that there is such a thing as a \"National Customer.\" They\n\ncontend that a product market built around so-called national customers is \"contrived,'' Defs.'\n\nOpp'n Br. at 16, and that the FTC's distinction between national and local customers is \"factually\n\nand economically meaningless,'' id at 13. They counter that the national-local distinction is not,\n\nas the FTC claims, built on differentiating customer characteristics, but is improperly based on an\n\nadministrative distinction as to whether the customer prefers to be managed at the corporate level\n\n                                                  41\n\f (making it a \"national\" customer) or at the local distribution center (making it a \"local\" customer).\n\n Id. at 12-15. The so-called national customer category, they also argue, is improperly based on a\n\n \"few core customers who say they prefer the merging parties.\" Id. at 13. In addition, Defendants\n\n assert that Dr. Israel did not perform a SSNIP test to assess the existence of a national customer\n\n market. Id. at 12.\n\n                !.      Legal Basis for Defining Relevant Product Market Based on Customer Type\n\n        Before turning to the evidence, the court first considers the legal basis for defining a\n\nproduct market based on a type of customer. Neither side comprehensively addressed this issue.\n\nAdmittedly, defining a product market based on a type of customer seems incongruous. After all,\n\none ordinarily thinks of a customer as purchasing a product in the market, and not as the product\n\nmarket itself But, in this case, according to the FTC, the national customer and broadline product\n\nconverge to define a market for broadline products sold to national customers.             Broadline\n\ndistributors must offer a particular kind of \"product\"-a cluster of goods and services that can be\n\ndelivered across a broad geographic area-to compete for national customers. In that sense, the\n\ncustomer's requirements operate to define the product offering itself\n\n        The clearest articulation of this approach to product market definition comes from the\n\nMerger Guidelines. The Merger Guidelines are not binding, but the Court of Appeals and other\n\ncourts have looked to them for guidance in previous merger cases. See, e.g., Heinz, 246 F.3d at\n\n716 n.9; H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 52 n.10. Section 4.1.4 of the Merger Guidelines provides\n\nthat \"[i]f a hypothetical monopolist could profitably target a subset of customers for price\n\nincreases, the Agencies may identify relevant markets defined around those targeted customers, to\n\nwhom a hypothetical monopolist would profitably and separately impose at least a SSNIP.\"\n\nMerger Guidelines § 4.1.4.      Markets to serve targeted customers are also known as \"price\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f discrimination markets.\" Id. Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp have endorsed market definition\n\n of this kind, as well: \"Successful price discrimination means that the disfavored geographic or\n\n product class is insulated from the favored class and, if the discrimination is of sufficient\n\n magnitude, should be counted as a separate relevant market.\" 2B Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert\n\n Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis ofAnt;trust Prindples and Their Application~ 534d (3d\n\n ed. 2007). The concern underlying price discrimination markets is that certain types of captured\n\n or dedicated customers could be targeted for monopolist pricing even if a price increase for all\n\n customers would not be profitable. See Merger Guidelines § 3; Areeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed.,\n\nsupra,~    533d (\"[S]ellers may be able to discriminate against buyers who have fewer alternatives\n\nor for whom the product performs a more valuable function[.]\").\n\n         Defining a market around a targeted customer, as the FTC urges here, is not free from\n\ncontroversy, as the different opinions in Whole Foods demonstrate. 19 Relying on an earlier version\n\nof the Merger Guidelines that recognized price discrimination against \"targeted buyers,\"\n\nJudge Brown explained that \"core consumers\"-in that case, those committed to premium and\n\nnatural organic supermarkets-\"can, in appropriate circumstances, be worthy of antitrust\n\nprotection.\" Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1037 (Brown, J.) (citing DOJ and FTC, 1992 Horizontal\n\nMerger Guidelines§ 1.12, 57 Fed. Reg. 41,552, 41,555 (1992)). Judge Brown went on to say:\n\n         In particular, when one or a few firms differentiate themselves by offering a\n         particular package of goods or services, it is quite possible for there to be a central\n         group of customers for whom \"only [that package] will do.\" ... Such customers\n         may be captive to the sole supplier, which can then, by means of price\n         discrimination, extract monopoly profits from them while competing for the\n         business of marginal customers.\n\n\n\n\n19\n   The FTC cites to the \"distinct customers\" factor in Brown Shoe as support for defining a market around a targeted\ncustomer. However, Brown Shoe only listed \"distinct customers\" as one of many factors for courts to consider in\ndefining a market. Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. It did not endorse defining a market around a group of targeted\ncustomers.\n\n                                                        43\n\f Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1038 (Brown, J.) (quoting Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 574) (alteration in\n\n original).\n\n          Judge Kavanaugh, in dissent, rejected defining a market around a \"core customer.\" Whole\n\n Foods, 548 F.3d at 1062 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). According to Judge Kavanaugh, \"there is\n\n no support in the law for that singular focus on the core customer. Indeed, if that approach took\n\n root, it would have serious repercussions because virtually every merger involves some core\n\n customers who would stick with the company regardless of a significant price increase. \" 20 Id. The\n\n relevant question for market definition, according to Judge Kavanaugh, is not whether a die-hard\n\ngroup of core customers would be impacted by a substantial price increase, but whether the merged\n\ncompany \"could increase prices by five percent or more without losing so many marginal\n\ncustomers as to make the price increase unprofitable.\" Id.\n\n                   2.        Evidence Supporting a National Broadline Product Market\n\n          Ultimately, the court here need not resolve the Whole Foods disagreement over defining a\n\nmarket around a \"core\" customer. That is because the ordinary factors that courts consider in\n\ndefining a market-the Brown Shoe practical indicia and the Merger Guidelines' SSNIP test-\n\nsupport a finding that broadline distribution to national customers is a relevant product market.\n\nSee, e.g., Areeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed.,              supra,~     533d (\"If the defendant can profit by charging\n\npharmacies a price significantly over its cost, then the pharmacy sales are a relevant market[.]\").\n\n\n\n\n20\n   The Merger Guidelines do not, for instance, set forth how a court is to distinguish a \"targeted\" group of customers\nfrom customers in general. This gives rise to the question of what limiting principles or factors a court should apply\nin defining a price discrimination market. Absent limitations, price discrimination against a single customer might be\nused to justify blocking a merger. This is not a mere theoretical possibility. According to the Merger Guidelines, \"[i]f\nprices are negotiated individually with customers, the hypothetical monopolist test may suggest relevant markets that\nare as narrow as individual customers.\" Merger Guidelines § 4.1.4 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                          44\n\f                       a.      Industry and public recognition\n\n         Among the most compelling evidence supporting a product market for national customers\n\nis the fact that regional broadliners have formed cooperatives, such as DMA and MUG, to compete\n\nfor customers with a geographically dispersed footprint. Regional distributors, because of their\n\nlimited footprints, do not have the capacity to serve customers with multi-regional needs across all\n\nof their locations.   Only Sysco and USF have that capacity. These cooperatives were formed\n\nspecifically to compete against Sysco and USF, by enabling regional competitors to combine to\n\nprovide nationwide or multi-regional delivery and, importantly, to offer a single point of contact\n\nfor the customer. Dan Cox, the President and CEO ofDMA, explained that DMA was formed in\n\n1988 as a competitive response to Sysco' s merger with another company, Continental. See\n\nPX00565-051 at 202. He explained that \"[w]hen that industry event took place, it was the first\n\ntime that there was truly a national platform for foodservice distribution.\" Id. Put simply, business\n\nventures like DMA would not exist if there were not a separate market for customers who have\n\nnational or multi-regional distribution needs. See Rothery Storage, 792 F.2d at 218 n.4 (stating\n\nthat courts must \"assume that economic actors usually have accurate perceptions of economic\n\nrealities\").\n\n        Equally compelling evidence of the national-local distinction comes from a report done by\n\nthe management consulting firm, McK.insey & Co., whom Sysco hired to assist with merger\n\nintegration.   After closely analyzing the two companies' operations, McKinsey prepared a\n\npresentation in July 2014, titled \"National, Intermediate, and Field Coverage Models.\" The\n\npresentation observed that \"Sysco and US Foods have different approaches to grouping customers\n\nand determining service models .... Both companies effectively operate two service models with\n\ndistinct capabilities to serve two types of customers.\" PX09010-002 (emphasis added). The\n\n\n\n                                                45\n\f presentation described \"National Customers\" as those who \"use complex contracts with margin\n\n schedules, make online purchases of proprietary products, require auditing support, and coordinate\n\n across multiple markets.\" Id. By contrast, \"Field Customers\" were those who \"make weekly\n\npurchases through in-person consultations, receive specialist support tailored to independent\n\nrestaurants, require minimal auditing support, and operate in I or few markets.\" Id. McKinsey\n\nfurther observed that national customers' \"requirements\" included \"[ s]et margin schedule\n\ncontract[s]\"; \"[e]fficient ordering across multiple locations\"; \"[l]arge number[s] of deviated,\n\nproprietary and close-coded products\"; \"[r]egulatory and audit support\"; \"[i]n-depth reporting\";\n\nand \"[c]onsistency of service, pricing and products across multiple [m]arkets.\" PX09010-004.\n\nField customers' \"requirements,\" on the other hand, included the \"[a]bility to make decisions each\n\nweek along with consultation\"; \"[a]ccess to national, commodity, and some proprietary products\";\n\n\"[f]ull business, culinary, and product support for independent businesses\"; and \"minimal\"\n\n\"[c]oordination across geographies.\" Id. McKinsey ultimately recommended that the companies\n\nrecognize and build a new service model around a third kind of customer-an \"Intermediate\"\n\ncustomer-who would be identifiable based on five variables: (i) national contract/no contract;\n\n(ii) nature of industry; (iii) number of markets; (iv) number of regions; and (v) size of annual sales.\n\nPX09010-007. The McKinsey presentation identified as \"conclusively\" national those customers\n\nwho operate in three or more markets or two or more regions. Id.\n\n       McKinsey is not the only industry analyst or expert to acknowledge that national customers\n\nform a market distinct from local buyers. Cleveland Research Company, an investment research\n\nfirm, produced an analyst report on Sysco after the merger's announcement and recognized that\n\nSysco and USF serve a distinct group of national customers. One of the report's conclusions was\n\nthat \"Sysco/USP will [be] able to keep most of their larger contracted and national account\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\f customers for the near- and medium-term due to national scale and existing contracts .... Based\n\n on our research, most national operators prefer to deal with one distributor because it is more\n\n efficient and less expensive than dealing with several regional players.\" PX09332-006 (emphasis\n\n added).\n\n           The industry's trade group, the International Food Distributors Association (\"IFDA\"), also\n\n recognizes a distinction between national and local customers.        IFDA produces a Quarterly\n\n Operations survey that reports separate sales figures for \"national\" and \"street\" accounts.\n\nPX00570-004 at 78. IFDA's President, Mark Allen, explained that IFDA distinguishes between\n\nthe two because \"the dynamics between the two [types of] businesses might be a little bit different.\n\nThe operating metrics might be a little bit different.\" Id. at 80.\n\n        Defendants' ordinary course documents also recognize the national-local distinction and\n\ntout their strategic advantage as to the former. See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 52 (\"When\n\ndetermining the relevant product market, courts often pay close attention to the defendants'\n\nordinary course of business documents.\").        A Sysco \"Investor Day\" presentation from 2010\n\ndistinguishes the company's \"Contract Sales (Broadline)\" from \"Street Sales,\" PX03101-010, and\n\nseparates its \"Key Competitors - National,\" from regional competitors, PX03101-020. Similarly,\n\na presentation entitled \"Board of Directors Strategy Sessions,\" dated July 2010, distinguishes\n\nbetween Sysco's market size for \"corporate contracts\"-defined to include \"major foodservice\n\nmanagement (FSM) sales, major group purchasing organization (GPO) sales, and major chain\n\nsales (non FSM or GPO)\"-and \"Street\" business. PX01008-006.\n\n       USF has similar documents. An internal USF presentation, titled \"Business Overview,\"\n\ndescribes \"[USF's] Customers\" as falling into three categories: (i) \"Street: Independent restaurants\n\nor small local chains\"; (ii) \"National Accounts: Contracted customers located across the country,\"\n\n\n\n                                                  47\n\fincluding acute and long-term healthcare facilities, hotels and the hospitality industry, schools, and\n\nUS. military and government agencies; and (iii) \"National Chain Restaurants: Fast food and\n\nquick-serve establishments.\" PX03122-004. See also PX03034-006 (similarly categorizing the\n\ncompany's customers). A USF \"Investor Presentation\" from November 2012 describes USF as\n\nthe \"2nd largest national broadline distributor,\" PX03000-006, and touts its \"[a]bility to leverage\n\nour national scale to cost effectively service customers nationally,\" PX03000-014. Further, it\n\ndistinguishes between \"National Scale,\" where \"US Foods is the second-largest broadline\n\nfoodservice distributor in the US.,\" and \"Local Scale,\" where \"US Foods is estimated #1 or #2\n\nposition in   II of served markets,\" PX03000-014.     See also PX03007-007 (internal document in\n\nwhich KKR & Co., one of USF's private equity owners, distinguishes between \"Street and\n\nNational Account customer segments\").\n\n       Other key players in the industry also recognize that national customers are different.\n\nFor instance, the President and CEO of PFG, George Holm, agreed that \"Sysco and US Foods are\n\nthe only two distributors for broadline with the capability to serve national broadline customers\n\nwith locations dispersed throughout the United States,\" including foodservice management\n\ncompanies, GPOs, large healthcare systems, and certain restaurant chains.             Hr'g Tr. 596.\n\nRepresentatives of DMA and Reinhart likewise referred to national customers as those that are\n\ngeographically dispersed and need a single point of contact. See PX00412-002-003; PX00415-\n\n004.\n\n                       b.     Distinct customer needs\n\n       There is ample record evidence that national customers' needs differ from those of local\n\ncustomers. The McKinsey analysis described above concisely summarized those distinctions.\n\nPX09010-004.\n\n\n\n                                                48\n\f        For starters, national customers, because of their dispersed geographic presence, often\n\n require a broadliner to meet their foodservice needs in more than one region. As a result, the\n\nnumber of distribution centers in a broadliner's network is often an important factor for such\n\n customers. In sharp contrast, according to Sysco, \"all, or almost all,\" of its \"local contract\n\ncustomers\" are served by only one distribution center. PX01400-001.\n\n        The Defendants' ordinary course documents highlighted their comprehensive distribution\n\nnetworks as a competitive advantage for serving national customers. See, e.g., PX03000-014 (USF\n\npresentation touting its \"[a]bility to leverage our national scale to cost effectively service\n\ncustomers nationally\"); PX00247-001-002 (USF email communication t o - describing\n\nthe \"US Foods Value Proposition\" as including \"Privately held National Distribution footprint\n\ncompany\"; \"Single IT operating platform nationally\"; and a \"Single Point of Contact\"); PXO 1062-\n\n005 (Sysco presentation to Aramark highlighting that Sysco' s \"national footprint, strong service\n\napproach and our breadth of product offerings is what differentiates us from our competition\").\n\nAs USF's David Schreibman acknowledged during the evidentiary hearing, \"US Foods['] leading\n\nnational market position is due to US Foods['] geographic presence that includes 62 distribution\n\ncenters across the United States.\" Hr'g Tr. 1520-21. He also acknowledged that Sysco was the\n\nonly company with greater scale than USF. Id. at 1522.\n\n       In addition to multi-regional distribution capabilities, national customers generally demand\n\na set margin contract that applies across multiple locations. As PFG' s George Holm testified, a\n\nsingle contract enables customers to simplify contract administration and to reduce administrative\n\ncosts. Id. at 600-02. Additionally, national customers often use RFPs and/or bilateral negotiations\n\nto award broadline foodservice distribution contracts. Id. at 1595-97. In sharp contrast, pricing\n\nfor local or \"street\" customers, according to Sysco, \"[is] ultimately the result of individual\n\n\n\n                                                49\n\f negotiations between the customer and [broad.liner]\" and \"can vary on a weekly and even daily\n\n basis.\" PX06057-032.\n\n        National customers also seek a single technology platform for handling their purchases.\n\n Consolidating purchasing through a single ordering platform creates efficiencies and cost savings,\n\n particularly as it relates to managing direct contracts with manufacturers and administering price\n\n changes. The importance of this feature is evidenced by DMA's development of a single ordering\n\nplatform that enables customers to purchase from its members.          Indeed, DMA promotes its\n\ntechnology platform as superior to Sysco's and USF's. PX00565-006 at 23-24. If national\n\ncustomers had not demanded such a feature, DMA would not have developed it.\n\n        Finally, product consistency is a factor for some national customers, particularly for those\n\nwho wish-to-purchase private label products. See PX09010-004 (McKinsey report identifying as\n\na \"Customer requirement[]\" for \"National\" customers \"consistency of service, pricing, and\n\nproducts across multiple Markets\"). Large customers can achieve a high degree of product\n\nconsistency through direct contracting with product manufacturers or by purchasing proprietary\n\nbrands stocked by Defendants. DX-01359 at 73 (Dr. Bresnahan report observing that \"one way\n\ncustomers that value consistency achieve it is through direct negotiation with manufacturers to\n\ncreate propriety products\" and that \"[c]ustomers can also rely on national brands to ensure\n\nconsistency\"). However, because private label goods offer a strong value benefit, if a national\n\ncustomer wishes to purchase such goods and have them available across all of its locations, it can\n\ndo so most efficiently through a broad.liner with national geographic scope. See Hr'g Tr. 600\n\n(George Holm of PFG stating that one reason national customers prefer to contract with Sysco or\n\nUSF is that \"[w]here they have a preference for a private brand, []it is the same product [across]\n\ntheir system\").\n\n\n\n                                                50\n\f                       c,     Defendants' Operations\n\n        Both Sysco and USF operate dedicated sales groups from their national headquarters that\n\n are responsible for negotiating and managing contracts with customers who use multiple\n\n distribution centers. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 572-74 (holding that centralized station security\n\nservices operated on a national level is a relevant product market). Sysco refers to these customers\n\nas \"corporate multi-unit customers,\" or CMUs. USF refers to them as \"national sales customers.\"\n\nAccording to USF's Senior Vice President for National Sales, Tom Lynch, each national customer\n\nin his group has a single USF representative who is responsible for that customer. The largest\n\ncustomers are assigned a full-time dedicated employee to manage the account. PX00517-014-015\n\nat 56-58.\n\n                       d.     SSNIP Test\n\n        Contraiy to what Defendants contend, Dr. Israel did perform a SSNIP test to determine\n\nwhether there is a separate product market for national customers. That SSNIP test was performed\n\nas an element of the SSNIP test that Dr. Israel used to assess whether broadline distribution was a\n\nrelevant product market.    As Dr. Israel testified, he applied to national customers the same\n\n10 percent gross margin that he used to calculate the aggregate diversion ratio for all customers.\n\nHr'g Tr. 1005 (stating that he used a 10 percent gross margin \"to both local and national\n\ncustomers\"). He derived the actual diversion for national customers based on the RFP/bidding\n\ndata provided by the defendant companies. Id. at 1009 (describing the \"RFP/bidding data\" as\n\n\"really national [customer] data\"). Using the same methods discussed above, Dr. Israel calculated\n\n\n\nUSF' s national customers to be !pf§iltfJ:'I. In other words, o v e r - of the time (based\n\non potential revenue from sales opportunities), when Sysco or USF lost a bid opportunity for a\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\f national customer, it was to another broadliner. Because these percentages were greater than the\n\n aggregate diversion ratio of 50 percent, Dr. Israel concluded that broadline service to national\n\n customers was a relevant market. In other words, Dr. Israel found that only 50 percent of national\n\n broadline customers would need to remain within the broadline market to make a price increase\n\n profitable, while the actual percentage of national customers who would remain within the\n\n broadline market (by switching to another broadliner) was greater than 50 percent. Dr. Israel's\n\n calculations, therefore, indicated that broadline distribution to national customers was the relevant\n\n product market.\n\n          The court already has expressed its reservations about relying on the RFP/bidding data to\n\n precisely calculate the aggregate diversion ratio. But, as before, the court finds that the ultimate\n\n conclusion of the SSNIP test-that broadline foodservice to national customers is a relevant\n\n product market-is supported by the weight of the evidence.                       Numerous national customer\n\n witnesses testified that other channels of distribution were not adequate substitutes for broadline\n\n distribution. 21 Although Defendants have shown that some national customers who were served\n\n by broadliners are now served by systems or systems-like distributors-most notably, Subway and\n\nFive Guys-those are the exceptions. Subway and Five Guys, because of their limited menus, are\n\n more amenable to substituting to a systems model. The same simply cannot be said of other large\n\nnational customers, like GPOs, foodservice management companies, and hospitality chains, which\n\nrely heavily on broadliners.\n\n\n21\n   See Hr'g Tr. 143-145 (Christine Szrom, fact witness for U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, explaining that she is\nnot familiar with systems distribution and could \"absolutely not\" use a cash-and-carry distributors); Hr' g Tr. 214-17\n(James Thompson, Head of Procurement for Interstate Hotels and Resorts, stating that \"it would be very difficult if\nnot impossible\" to operate Interstate's foodservice distribution without a broadliner and that specialty is not a\nsubstitute for broadline distribution); PJ<llll-002 (Joan Ralph, Group Vice President at Premier, Inc., saying that\n\" [e] ven if we choose one day to contract with systems distributors, specialty distributors, or cash and carry stores,\neach would be as an additional, distinct service for our members who may ne_e~ck, last-minute item or two; none\n~ce or serve as a substitute for broadline distribution services\"); P~-002 ~\n- - , noting t h a t - cannot contract with a systems distributor or use other f~\n\n                                                          52\n\f                         e,      Defendants' arguments against a national customer market\n\n          Asserting that there is no separate product market for national broadline customers,\n\nDefendants first argue that the national-local distinction is \"arbitrary\" because it is based on\n\nnothing more than customer preference about account management.              Defendants' executives\n\ntestified that Sysco's CMU customers and USF's national customers are so designated, not because\n\nof any particular characteristic or group of characteristics, but purely because the customer prefers\n\nto have its account managed by the headquarters sales team, instead of by its local distribution\n\ncenter.     The FTC's and Dr. Israel's reliance on the companies' administrative designation,\n\nDefendants argue, leads to arbitrary classifications. For example, some of Defendants' customers\n\nwho use a small number of distribution centers are counted by the FTC as \"national\" customers.\n\nAs Dr. Hausman demonstrated, 37 percent of Sysco's CMU customers use five or fewer\n\ndistribution centers and 55 percent use ten or fewer. And, for USF, 51 percent of their national\n\ncustomers use five or fewer distribution centers and 67 percent use ten or fewer. Hr' g Tr. 1976.\n\nAdditionally, similarly situated customers-in terms of size, number of distribution centers,\n\nrevenues, etc.-are sometimes treated differently. One customer may be identified as national and\n\nanother as local, simply because one prefers to be managed from headquarters and the other from\n\nthe local distribution center.\n\n          Defendants are correct that their \"national\" customer lists are over-inclusive-not every\n\ncustomer on those lists has multi-regional distribution needs. And they are also correct that the\n\nFTC could have more accurately defined a class of \"national\" customers by testing each candidate\n\nnational customer against specific \"national\" criteria, such as the number of distribution centers\n\nused. But, ultimately, for the purpose of defining a product market, the court finds that the parties'\n\n\n\n\n                                                 53\n\f\"national\" customer designation is a useful proxy for customers requiring geographically dispersed\n\ndistribution and attendant services.\n\n        As the graphic below prepared by Dr. Israel shows, if the merger were to occur, a\n\nsignificant proportion of the combined company's national customer revenues would come from\n\ncustomers who use a large number of distribution centers. PX09375-077, Figure 3. National\n\ncustomers using more than 3 5 distribution centers would account   forl percent of a merged Sysco-\nUSF' s revenue; national customers using more than 24 distribution centers would account for     I\npercent of revenue; and national customers using at least 10 distribution centers would account for\n\nIIpercent of revenue. Those figures demonstrate that Defendants' national-customer designations\ncapture those key customers (based on revenues) who use a large number of distribution centers.\n\nThe \"national\" designation includes, among others, the largest GPOs, like Premier, Novation, and\n\nMedAssets, each of whom uses over      I   distribution centers; the largest foodservice management\n\ncompanies, like Sodexo, Aramark, and Compass, each of whom uses more than           I   distribution\n\ncenters; the largest hotel management company, Hilton, which uses      I   distribution centers; and\n\nthe second largest government customer, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which uses      I\ndistribution centers (the largest is the U.S. Department of Defense, which uses     I   distribution\n\ncenters). PX09375-076, Table 5. Thus, for these customers, the label \"national\" is not merely\n\nadministrative; it accurately reflects this high revenue-generating group's actual needs. The fact\n\n\n\n\n                                                 54\n\f that some smaller customers are included among the Defendants' ·'national'' designations does not\n\nmean that the desig;1atio11 lacks evidentia1y value for defining a market for national customers.\n\n                                              Figure 3\n              SyM:o and l'SF 2013 Re\\eUUt'S   IJ,v l'\\uml>er ufDistriuution Centen rwd\n\n\n\n\n       Next, Defendants assert that defining a pnce discrimination market around national\n\ncustomers is untenable because the FTC failed to show that so-called national customers shared\n\nany objectively observable characteristics that would enable t11e combined company to price\n\ndiscriminate against that group. See Merger Guidelines § 3 (stating that \"differential pricing\" is\n\nan essential element of price discrimination, which \"may involve\" offering different pricing to\n\ndifferent types of customers \"based on observable characteristics\"), In other worcls, they argue\n\nthat this grouping of customers is so heterogeneous that there is no collllllon, identifiable\n\n\n\n\n                                                55\n\f characteristic that could serve as a proxy for determining which customers in the broadline market\n\n have inelastic demand.\n\n        Defendants are undoubtedly correct that, even among their largest customers, there is great\n\n variety in the customers' servicing needs and requirements. But price discrimination can occur\n\n even when customers do not have common observable characteristics. As the Merger Guidelines\n\n state, markets for targeted customers may exist \"when prices are individually negotiated and\n\n suppliers have information about customers that would allow a hypothetical monopolist to identify\n\ncustomers that are likely to pay ahigher price forthe relevant product.\" Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.4;\n\nsee also Carl Shapiro, The 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines: From Hedgehog to Fox in Forty\n\nYears, 77 Antitrust L.J. 49, 93 (2010) (observing that, in markets for intermediate goods and\n\nservices, \"prices typically are negotiated and price discrimination is common\").\n\n        Here, the evidence is clear that Defendants engage in individual negotiations with their\n\nnational customers and possess substantial information about them.            Indeed, the fact that\n\nDefendants employ substantially more sales representatives than other broadliners, PX093 50-218,\n\nTable 30, and assign full-time dedicated employees to some of their largest customers is indicative\n\nof the \"know-your-customer\" philosophies of both firms. Defendants, therefore, already have\n\nsubstantial customer information that would allow them to predict which of their customers have\n\ninelastic demand and which do not. Price discrimination can occur in such a marketplace, even if\n\nthe targeted customers do not share specific identifiable traits.\n\n       Finally, Defendants contend that a product market of targeted national customers does not\n\ncomport with business realities. This argument has two main elements. First, they assert that,\n\ncontrary to what the FTC contends, Compl.    iii! 5, 42, national customers do not require a broadline\nfoodservice distributor that is national in scope. Rather, they argue, even at current prices, many\n\n\n\n                                                 56\n\flarge customers spread their distribution needs over multiple regional suppliers. For instance,\n\nDefendants cite GPOs, l i k e - · - ' Amerinet and large government agencies. like\n\nthe Defonse Logistics Agency, as using a regional contracting approach. Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 15.\n\nThey also refer to one of the largest foodservice management companies, Sodexo. which splits its\n\ndistribution into   I   regions. Id. A. nd. then there is Subway and Five Guys. two large chain\n\nrestaurants that have regionalized and purchase from multiple suppliers. Id. at 15-16. Because\n\nthese tyves of customers can regionalize or credibly threaten to regionalize. Defendants argue, the\n\nmerged company would not be able to discriminate against them on price.\n\n        But Defendants' argument founders when faced with the actual purchasing habits of the\n\nindustry's largest customers. The evidence shows that the bulk of the broadline purchasing done\n\nby most geographically dispersed breadline customers is still done through Sysco and USF.\n\nOf Avendra's members' breadline spend,          I     percent is witl1 Sysco and USF.

Sodexo, Aramark, Compass, and Centerplate,\n\nrespectively, spend     I   percent,   I   percent,   I    percent, and   I    percent of their broa<lline\n\nfoodservice distribution dollars with Sysco and USF. PFF at 113-16: FTC Closing Arg. Slides at\n\n35. The story is similar for large hospitality customers. Two of tl1e largest, Hilton and Interstate,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      57\n\f allocate   I   percent and   I   percent of their broadline spend, respectively, to the two companies.\n\n PFF at 114, 116; FTC Closing Arg. Slides at 35. Even the Defense Logistics Agency, which\n\n contracts regionally, dedicates     I   percent of its broadline spend to Sysco and USF. PFF at 116;\n\n FTC Closing Arg. Slides at 35.\n\n        The court infers from this evidence that geographically dispersed customers view Sysco\n\n and USF as having significant comparative advantages over regional distributors, particularly\n\n because of their far-reaching distribution networks. Though some customers have spread their\n\n business over multiple broadliners, a significant portion (as measured by total revenues) have not.\n\n Indeed, PFG's George Holm observed that the \"clear trend amongst national broadline customers\n\nis to move toward a single nationwide provider.\" Hr'g Tr. 598 (emphasis added); PX09081-002\n\n(letter from PFG's counsel to FTC, dated November 14, 2014, stating the same). See Brown Shoe,\n\n370 U.S. at 332 (footnote omitted) (\"Another important factor to consider is the trend toward\n\nconcentration in the industry.\"). Mr. Holm further admitted that either Sysco or USF essentially\n\nwins every RFP issued by a national customer. Hr' g Tr. 598-99. And PFG acknowledged by letter\n\nto the FTC that, even as the country's third-largest broadliner, \"PFG has difficulty competing for\n\nnational broadline accounts because it does not have a nationwide footprint of broadline\n\ndistribution centers.\" PX09081-001. Other large regional broadliners have said the same about\n\ntheir own businesses models. 23 Defendants' contention-that a product market defined around\n\nnational customers does not comport with business reality because such customers have\n\nregionalized or can regionalize-is thus belied by the record evidence.\n\n\n\n\n23\n  See, e.g., PX00415-004 (Reinhart); PX00416-003 (Merchants); PX00434-003-004 (Labatt); PX00438-002-003\n(Cash-Wa); PX00443-005 (Ben E. Keith); PX00449-003 (Jacmar); PX00451-005 (Services Group of America);\nPX00458-004 (Nicholas & Co.); PX00460-002-003 (Shamrock); PX00529-047-048 at 188-89 (Gordon).\n\n                                                     58\n\f        Second, Defendants argue that margin data shows that, as a merged entity, they would not\n\nbe able to price discriminate against national customers.        Dr. Hausman demonstrated that\n\nDefendants' margin on sales to customers who use fewer distribution centers is actually higher\n\nthan their margin on sales to those who use more. DX-01355 at 58-61. Defendants contend that\n\nunder the FTC's theory, they presently have a duopoly as to national customers, yet they do not\n\nearn duopoly profits on that customer class. Defendants thus maintain that, just as they cannot\n\ntoday price discriminate to earn duopoly profits, they would not be able to price discriminate after\n\nthe merger to earn monopoly profits.\n\n        Defendants' argument, however, is unconvincing. Defendants' present inability to earn\n\nduopoly profits on national customers is probably because large customers can keep prices down\n\nby leveraging the defendant companies against one another. As the Cleveland Research Company\n\nobserved: \"Based on our research, we believe both Sysco and US Foods have priced each other\n\ndown competing for larger national/regional contract accounts over the last several years.\"\n\nPX09332-004. The ability of large buyers to keep prices down, functioning as what is known in\n\nantitrust literature as \"power buyers,'' see Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 58-59; Merger\n\nGuidelines § 8, depends on the alternatives these large buyers have available to them, see Shapiro,\n\nsupra, at 95; Areeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed.,     supra,~   943a. If a merger reduces alternatives, the\n\npower buyers' ability to constrain price and avoid price discrimination can be correspondingly\n\ndiminished. See Merger Guidelines § 8 (\"Normally, a merger that eliminates a supplier whose\n\npresence contributed significantly to a buyer's negotiating leverage will harm that buyer.\"). Thus,\n\nthe fact that Defendants are currently unable to price discriminate against national customers does\n\nnot mean that they would be unable to do so as a merged firm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                59\n\f        C.      Product Market Summary\n\n        Having considered and weighed the parties' arguments and evidence, the court concludes\n\nthat the FTC has carried its burden of showing that, for purposes of merger analysis, (i) broadline\n\nfoodservice distribution is a relevant product market, and (ii) broadline foodservice distribution to\n\nnational customers is also a relevant product market.\n\n        D.     Relevant Geographic Market\n\n        The court now turns to the second part of defining the relevant market, which involves\n\ndetermining the relevant geographic market. The Supreme Court has stated that, for Section 7 of\n\nthe Clayton Act, the relevant geographic market is \"the area in which the goods or services at issue\n\nare marketed to a significant degree by the acquired firm.\" Marine Bancorp., 418 U.S. at 620-21.\n\nStated differently, \"[t]he proper question to be asked ... [is] where, within the area of competitive\n\noverlap, the effect of the merger on competition will be direct and immediate.\" Phi/a. Nat. Bank,\n\n374 U.S. at 357; see also Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 49 (citation omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (stating that the relevant geographic market is \"the area to which\n\nconsumers can practically turn for alternative sources of the product and in which the antitrust\n\ndefendants face competition\"). Like the product market, the geographic market must \"correspond\n\nto the commercial realities of the industry and be economically significant.\" Brown Shoe, 370\n\nU.S. at 336-37 (footnote omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that an \"element of 'fuzziness would seem inherent in any attempt to delineate the\n\nrelevant geographical market,\"' and therefore \"such markets need not-indeed cannot-be defined\n\nwith scientific precision.\" Conn. Nat. Bank, 418 U.S. at 669 (quoting Phi/a. Nat 'l Bank, 374 U.S.\n\nat 360 n.37). That said, the relevant geographic market \"must be sufficiently defined so that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                60\n\f [c]ourt understands in which part of the country competition is threatened.\" Cardinal Health,\n\n 12 F. Supp. 2d at 49.\n\n        The FTC contends that there are two relevant geographic markets in this case. For national\n\nbroadline customers, the relevant geographic market is nationwide. For local broadline customers,\n\nthe relevant geographic markets are localized around Defendants' distribution centers.\n\n        With regard to national customers, for essentially the same reasons that the FTC asserts\n\nthat there is a product market for broadline distribution to national customers, the FTC asserts that\n\nthe geographic market for those customers is nationwide.           The FTC relies on the fact that\n\nDefendants plan on a national level and have \"national account\" teams dedicated to national\n\ncustomers; their contractual pricing and service terms with national customers apply across\n\nregions; and their competition for national customers is largely other broadliners with nationwide\n\ncoverage.\n\n        As for local customers, as discussed in more detail below, the FTC's local geographic\n\nmarkets were constructed by Dr. Israel and are premised on customers' proximity to Defendants'\n\ndistribution centers. The basic idea is that, for local customers, distance to a distribution center is\n\na key service factor and, for Defendants, distance traveled from a distribution center to make\n\ndeliveries is a critical cost component.     The FTC alleges that the merger threatens to harm\n\ncompetition in 32 local geographic markets where Sysco and USF together currently have\n\ndominant market shares. Compl.     ~   60.\n\n       Defendants dispute that there is a nationwide geographic market for the same reasons that\n\nthey contend that there is no national customer product market. As for the local geographic\n\nmarkets, Defendants aggressively challenge the methodology that Dr. Israel used in defining local\n\nmarkets. Their primary criticism is that the geographic areas are drawn so narrowly that they\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f exclude actual competition from the relevant market. This results, they contend, in local market\n\n concentrations that artificially inflate Defendants' market shares.\n\n                l.      National Market\n\n        Although the physical act of delivering food products occurs locally, for national customers\n\nthe relevant geographic area for competitive alternatives is nationwide, primarily because of their\n\ngeographically dispersed footprint.     Defendants compete within this market by touting their\n\nnationwide distribution capabilities to these customers; bidding against other broadliners with\n\nmulti-regional capabilities (which is to say, against each other and the regional cooperatives);\n\ncoordinating the marketing, negotiating, and managing of these customers through their \"national\n\naccount\" teams; and entering with these customers into a single contract whose terms, including\n\npricing, apply across regions. For these reasons, the court finds that the relevant geographic market\n\nfor broadline foodservice to national customers is nationwide. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 575-76\n\n(finding a national geographic market where central station services \"operated on a national level,''\n\nand there was \"national planning,\" a nationwide schedule of prices, and nationwide contracting\n\nfor multi-state businesses); Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 50 (finding a national geographic\n\nmarket where evidence showed that \"GPOs negotiate contracts with several wholesalers, making\n\nthe same prices available throughout the country to all of their members-local, regional, or\n\nnational\").\n\n               2.      Local Markets\n\n       Defining the local geographic market presents a far greater challenge. Not surprisingly,\n\nthere is no industry standard for delineating the area that makes up a local geographic market for\n\nbroadline distribution. Each local market has its own unique attributes. Customer composition\n\nand concentration differs across markets; so does the demand for products, with SKU variations\n\n\n\n                                                 62\n\f reflecting local tastes and palettes. Average driving distances for foodservice distributors vary\n\n depending on the density of the area, with longer hauls more common in rural parts of the country\n\nand shorter trips more prevalent in urban areas. And, of course, the competitors vary from market\n\nto market.\n\n        The FTC tasked Dr. Israel with defining the local geographic markets. He constructed\n\nthem as follows. In his first step, Dr. Israel drew circles around the location of each Sysco and\n\nUSF distribution center. To determine the size of each circle, Dr. Israel used a radius, referred to\n\nas the \"draw distance,\" that, on average, captured 75 percent of the distribution center's sales to\n\nlocal customers. The length of each distribution center's 75 percent draw radius differed. For\n\nexample, the 75 percent draw distance around Sysco's Billings, Montana, facility was 262 miles,\n\nwhereas the 75 percent draw distance around Sysco's Jersey City, New Jersey, facility was only\n\n24 miles. PX09350-221-224, Table 38. What that means is Sysco drives over 200 miles further\n\nto capture 75 percent of its local sales in Billings than it does in Jersey City. That disparity makes\n\nsense, as more populated areas correspond to higher customer concentrations and shorter delivery\n\ndistances.\n\n       In his second step, Dr. Israel identified each company's local customers that fell within an\n\narea of intersection between the draw circle around the Sysco distribution center and the draw\n\ncircle around the USF distribution center. This area of intersection was termed the \"overlap area.\"\n\nThese \"overlap customers,\" according to Dr. Israel, were the customers most likely to suffer harm\n\nfrom the merger, because these were the customers who would be left with one less alternative\n\nsupplier after the merger. Exhibit 40 from Dr. Bresnahan's report, which is reproduced below,\n\nshows Dr. Israel's methodology in the Omaha, Nebraska, area. The blue-dotted circle corresponds\n\n\n\n\n                                                 63\n\f to Sysco's 75 percent draw area, and the green-dotted circle corresponds to USF's. The dark gray\n\n area corresponds to the \"overlap customers.\" DX-01359, Ex. 40.\n\n\n                                                   EXHIBIT 40\n              OISTRlBUTION CENTERS LOCATED NEAR THE FTC'S CONTESTED LOCAL AREAS\n                                   OMAHA, NE/COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                         @   MaJO~      tkuad\\r.e.r\n                                        {fl' US Fc~?j-s BrnadlF1e                        0   MaJf..i[   6ruadlaHJ~' w~~i; Sa~es   f}a:a\n                                      'W>W   l5% USF Draw l\\r~a \\'DQ);t rrnt~ radiu!>J\n\n\n\n\n       In his third step, Dr. Israel identified the broadline distributors who could compete for the\n\ncustomers in the overlap area. To do this, Dr. Israel drew circles around each overlap customer\n\nusing the 75 percent draw radius. This created a larger circle that moved the outer boundaries of\n\nthe overlap area by the same radius as the 75 percent draw area, which is represented by the light\n\ngray area in Exhibit 40 above. According to Dr. Israel's analysis, the light gray area is the area to\n\nwhich customers can practically tum for alternative sources of broadline distribution. All of the\n                                                         64\n\f competitors located within the light gray area were factored into Dr. Israel's local market share\n\ncomputations.\n\n        Defendants attack Dr. Israel's \"circle drawing exercise\" as \"arbitrary\" and not reflective of\n\nindustry realities. Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 27. Specifically, they assert that Dr. Israel's methodology\n\nis flawed because it assumes that competitors will drive no greater distance than Sysco's or USF's\n\n75 percent draw radius to serve customers. Defendants point to competitor declarations and\n\ntestimony showing that in many of the 32 local markets in which the FTC claims Defendants have\n\na dominant market share, competitors are willing to, and do, drive distances greater than the\n\n75 percent draw radius to compete for and deliver to customers.\n\n        Notwithstanding this criticism, the court finds that there is nothing inherently \"arbitrary\"\n\nabout Dr. Israel's methodology in defining the local markets. To the contrary, given the absence\n\nof an industry standard for defining a local market, Dr. Israel's methodology provides a practical\n\napproach and solution to an otherwise thorny problem. Dr. Israel's premise in defining these\n\nmarkets-that driving distance matters-is amply supported by the record and common sense.\n\nCustomers who are farther away from a distribution center cost more to service. Longer distances\n\ncorrespond to, among other things, higher gas usage, more labor hours, and increased wear and\n\ntear on trucks. Given that the geographic market need not be defined by \"metes and bounds,\"\n\nConn. Nat 'l Bank, 418 U.S. at 669 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\nDr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology identifies \"the area of competitive overlap, [where] the\n\neffect of the merger on competition will be direct and immediate,\" Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at\n\n357. See also Conn. Nat'l Bank, 418 U.S. at 670 n.9 (remanding to the district court to define the\n\nlocal market and observing that the \"federal bank regulatory agencies define a bank's service area\n\nas the geographic area from which the bank derives 75% of its deposits\"). The court therefore\n\n\n\n                                                65\n\f concludes that the relevant local geographic markets are the areas of overlap resulting from\n\n Dr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology.\n\n        Ultimately, what really troubles Defendants about Dr. Israel's \"circle drawing exercise\" is\n\nnot the resulting geographic areas, but what those areas mean for calculating Defendants' local\n\nmarket shares. The court considers those arguments in the next section.\n\nII.     THE PROBABLE EFFECTS ON COMPETITION\n\n        Having concluded that the FTC has carried its burden of establishing a relevant market-\n\nboth a nationwide market for broadline foodservice to national customers and various local\n\nmarkets for broadline foodservice to local customers-the court turns next to \"the likely effects of\n\nthe proposed [merger] on competition within [those] market[s].\" SwedishMatch, 131 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 166. As the Court of Appeals explained in Heinz, the government \"must show that the merger\n\nwould produce 'a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market, and [would]\n\nresult[ ] in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market.\"' 246 F.3d at 715\n\n(quoting Phi/a. Nat'/ Bank, 374 U.S. at 363). \"Such a showing establishes a 'presumption' that\n\nthe merger will substantially lessen competition.\" Id. (citation omitted).\n\n       The Court of Appeals has held that the FTC can establish its prima facie case by showing\n\nthat the merger will result in an increase in market concentration above certain levels. Id. \"Market\n\nconcentration is a function of the number of firms in a market and their respective market shares.\"\n\nArch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 123.        A common tool used to measure changes in market\n\nconcentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI). Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716; see also Merger\n\nGuidelines § 5.3. HHI figures are \"calculated by summing the squares of the individual firms'\n\nmarket shares,\" a calculation that \"gives proportionately greater weight to the larger market\n\nshares.\" Merger Guidelines§ 5.3. \"Sufficiently large HHI figures establish the FTC's prima facie\n\n\n\n                                                66\n\f case that a merger is anti-competitive.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716. The Merger Guidelines, which\n\nprovide \"a useful illustration of the application ofHHI,\" FTC v. PPG Indus., Inc., 798 F.2d 1500,\n\n 1503 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1986), state that a market with an HHI above 2,500 is considered \"highly\n\nconcentrated\"; a market with an HHI between 1,500 and 2,500 is considered \"moderately\n\nconcentrated\"; and a market with an HHI below 1,500 is considered \"unconcentrated,\" Merger\n\nGuidelines§ 5.3. Furthermore, a merger that results in \"highly concentrated markets that involve\n\nan increase in the HHI of more than 200 points will be presumed to be likely to enhance market\n\npower.\" Id. In Heinz, the Court of Appeals recognized that an increase in HHI by 510 points\n\n\"creates, by a wide margin, a presumption that the merger will lessen competition.\" 246 F.3d at\n\n716.\n\n        A.     Concentration in the National Broadline Customer Market\n\n               1.      Dr. Israel's National Broadline Customer Market Shares Calculations\n\n        In some cases the merging parties' market shares and post-merger HHis are seemingly\n\nuncontroversial. See, e.g., Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1081-82; H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 71-\n\n72. Not so here. Because there are no industl)'-recognized market shares for national broadline\n\ncustomers, the FTC tasked Dr. Israel with calculating the market shares and the HHis.           Not\n\nsurprisingly, Defendants vigorously contested his methodology and conclusions.\n\n       Dr. Israel calculated Defendants' national customer shares as follows. As his first step, he\n\nidentified Defendants' individual sales to national broadline customers, i.e., the numerator for the\n\nmarket share calculation. Those sales figures came directly from the parties' \"national\" customer\n\ndesignations: for Sysco, its sales to CMU customers, and for USF, its sales to national customers.\n\n       Next, Dr. Israel determined the total sales by all broadline distributors to national\n\ncustomers, i.e., the denominator for the national share calculation. Again, because there is no\n\n\n\n                                                67\n\f industry-recognized figure for such sales, Dr. Israel estimated them. He did so in two ways. First,\n\n he aggregated the national sales of the three principal competitors for national customers-Sysco,\n\n USF, and DMA-and added in another share equal to DMA's.                  This total comprised the\n\n denominator for his \"baseline\" shares calculation. PX09350-074. The addition of another DMA-\n\n sized share to the denominator was premised on his observation from the RFP/bidding data that\n\nthe size of sales to national customers by all broadliners other than Sysco, USF, and DMA was\n\nabout the same as DMA's.\n\n        Dr. Israel also used a second method to calculate the total sales to national customers. He\n\naggregated the national sales reported by the largest 16 broadliners, including DMA and MUG, in\n\nresponse to the FTC's civil investigative demands. This data is referred to as CID data. Dr. Israel\n\nran several \"sensitivities\" on this sum, adding in sales to account for variations in CID responses\n\n(e.g., some distributors did not segregate \"national\" from total sales). Dr. Israel also aggregated\n\nthe national sales of Sysco, USF, DMA, and MUG, plus an estimate of national sales for all other\n\nresponding distributors based on the assumption that each distributor's national-local sales ratio\n\nwas the same as Defendants' ratio.      Dr. Israel's various approaches yielded a total national\n\nbroadline sales estimate of $28 to $30 billion. Hr'g Tr. 1177-78; see also PX09060-006 (PFG\n\nbusiness plan estimating the size of the national customer market to be approximately $20 billion).\n\n       As his last step, Dr. Israel adjusted his market shares to account for the divestiture to PFG.\n\nThe chart below reflects Dr. Israel's post-merger, post-divestiture market share and HHI\n\ncalculations. For his \"baseline\" calculation, Dr. Israel determined that the parties' post-merger\n\nnational broadline customer market share would be 71 percent with an HHI increase of nearly\n\n2,000 points. His CID data-based calculations, shown as (i) through (vi) in the chart, also yielded\n\nhigh post-merger shares and significantly increased HHis.          Dr. Israel's most conservative\n\n\n\n                                                68\n\f approach, in which he assumed that the top 16 broadliners had national to local sales ratios that\n\n were equal to Defendants' ratio of such shares-( iv) in the chart below-resulted in a post-merger\n\nmarket share of 59 percent and an Hill increase of 1,500 points.

Defendants' Arguments\n\n          Defendants raise a host of objections to the reliability of Dr. Israel's methodology and\n\ncalculations. They contend that his use of their \"national\" sales in the numerator was arbitrary\n\nbecause, as discussed above, not all of Defendants' \"national\" sales are to customers with a multi-\n\nregional footprint. The inclusion of those sales, they contend, overstated Defendants' national\n\nmarket share. They also argue that Dr. Israel's numerator included some sales to systems-like\n\ncustomers, such as to Five Guys, but his denominator excluded competitors' systems sales. This\n\nasymmetry, they assert, also resulted in an overstatement of Defendants' share. They further\n\ncontend that the denominator used in Dr. Israel's \"baseline\" calculation is unreliable because it\n\nrelies on the flawed RFP/bidding data set. And, finally, they argue that the denominator in the\n\nCID data calculation excludes over $30 billion in sales-though the source of this number is\n\n\n\n                                                       69\n\f unclear. 24 They contend that these errors in developing the numerator resulted in biased market\n\n share calculations.\n\n          None of these arguments ultimately persuade the court that Dr. Israel's methodology or his\n\n market shares and HHI calculations are unreliable. The FTC need not present market shares and\n\n HHI estimates with the precision of a NASA scientist. The \"closest available approximation\"\n\n often will do. PPG, 798 F.2d at 1505 (citation omitted); see also H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n 72 (stating that a \"reliable, reasonable, close approximation of relevant market share data is\n\n sufficient\"). Indeed, in PPG, the FTC presented, and the Court of Appeals accepted, share\n\n calculations for \"every market the evidence suggests is remotely possible,\" which \"yield[ ed]\n\n results of similar magnitudes in market concentration.\" 798 F.2d at 1506. Similarly, Dr. Israel\n\nran multiple variants of his market shares and concentration analysis, using two different data sets\n\nand modifying one of these data sets, the CID data, in six different ways. Most convincing to the\n\ncourt was Dr. Israel's final method of calculating shares using the CID data, which assumed that\n\nall 16 of the top broadliners had the same national-local sales ratio as Defendants did. That\n\napproach yielded a low-end market share of 59 percent and an HHI increase of 1,500 points-\n\nalmost three times the 510 points that the Court of Appeals in Heinz found created a presumption\n\nof harm by a \"wide margin.\" 246 F.3d at 716. This variation almost certainly underestimated\n\nDefendants' market shares, as smaller broadliners are unlikely to have a ratio of national-local\n\nsales comparable to Defendants' ratio.\n\n         Another reason Defendants' arguments do not sway the court is that other evidence in the\n\nrecord supports Dr. Israel's calculations. As discussed above, the largest customers for broadline\n\n\n\n24\n   \"Dr. Israel acknowledged that he left out $30 billion in systems distribution in the \"sensitivity analysis purporting\nto account for systems sales.\" Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, ECF No. 171at263 (citing\nHr'g Tr. 1259-60).\n\n                                                          70\n\f distribution in the country-healthcare GPOs, foodservice management companies, hospitality\n\n companies, and large government agencies-make the vast majority of their broadline purchases\n\nfrom Defendants. These customers individually spend hundreds of millions of dollars (or more)\n\non broadline distribution-totaling approximately half of the national broadline market (based on\n\nDr. Israel's calculation of a total market of $28 to $30 billion). See FTC Closing Arg. Slides at\n\n3 5. If the largest customers are presently spending between 60 to 100 percent of their total food\n\nbudget with Defendants, id., then Dr. Israel's low-bound, post-merger combined market share of\n\n59 percent is consistent with market realities.\n\n        In addition, the only independent market share analysis of the broadline industry identified\n\nby the parties corroborates Dr. Israel's conclusions. The foodservice industry research firm\n\nTechnomic collected 2014 sales data from the country's 43 largest broadliners. DX02016. Taken\n\ntogether, Technomic estimated total broadline sales to be $125 billion.        Of that total, Sysco\n\naccounted for $35.7 billion and USF $23 billion, for a combined sum of $58.7 billion-nearly\n\n47 percent of U.S. sales. See id.; see also PX09045-015 (PFG presentation to FTC stating that\n\n\"[t]he two largest broadliners (Sysco and US Foods) accounted for 51 % of all broadline sales in\n\n2010,\" based on a study by Hale Group, \"Focus on Foodservice Distribution,\" dated April 11,\n\n2013); PX09045-014 (PFG presentation to FTC highlighting a 2011 Technomic study showing\n\nthat Sysco and USF had a combined market share of 58 percent among the top 10 broadline food\n\ndistributors).\n\n        Technomic's 47 percent combined market share estimate for total broadline sales is\n\nconsistent with Dr. Israel's low-end, post-divestiture estimate of 59 percent for national broadline\n\nsales. The Technomic data did not segregate national and local broadline customers. However,\n\nbecause the largest customers buy disproportionately from Sysco and USF, it stands to reason that\n\n\n\n                                                  71\n\f the companies' combined market share for national customers would be greater than 47 percent,\n\n as Dr. Israel found. Even a combined market share of 47 percent (admittedly, a pre-divestiture\n\n number) can give rise to a presumption of harm. See Phila. Nat 'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 364 (\"Without\n\n attempting to specify the smallest market share which would still be considered to threaten undue\n\n concentration, we are clear that 30% presents that threat.\").\n\n                3.           The Court's Finding as to National Broadline Customer Market Shares\n\n        The court thus finds that the FTC has shown, through Dr. Israel's testimony and other\n\nevidence, that a merger of Sysco and USF will result in a significant increase in market\n\nconcentration in the market for national broadline customers. The FTC therefore has established\n\na rebuttable presumption that the merger will substantially lessen competition in the market for\n\nnational broadline distribution.\n\n        B.      Concentration in the Local Markets\n\n                !.          Dr. Israel's Local Broadline Customer Market Shares Calculations\n\n        In addition to the market for national customers, the FTC also contends that the merged\n\nfirm would create highly concentrated local markets for broadline foodservice distribution. To be\n\nprecise, the FTC asserts that, in 32 different local markets, the merger between Sysco and USF\n\nwould result in dramatic increases in IIlils, thereby substantially lessening the competition in those\n\nmarkets. Compl.      ~   60, App. A. The FTC also maintains that the divestiture to PFG will not resolve\n\nDefendants' post-merger local market dominance.\n\n       As with the market for national customers, there is no industry study oflocal market shares.\n\nSee PX09045-019 (\"PFG is not aware of any systematic industry market share data\"). The FTC\n\nagain relied on Dr. Israel for those numbers.             His starting point for calculating local share\n\npercentages was his 75 percent draw area methodology for defining the local geographic markets.\n\n\n\n                                                     72\n\f See PX09350-058. As already discussed, Dr. Israel first identified the 75 percent overlap area in\n\n each local market and then identified the competitors that could serve those customers by drawing\n\n a circle with a radius equal to the 75 percent draw distance around each overlap customer. Next,\n\n to calculate the overall local market shares, Dr. Israel calculated a customer-specific market share.\n\nThat is, for each customer in the overlap area, he calculated the market shares for the competitors\n\nwho were located within the customer's 75 percent draw distance radius.              Dr. Israel then\n\naggregated each of these customer-specific shares to the local level, using weighted averages\n\nacross all overlap customers. The consequence of this methodology was that, the greater the\n\ncompetitor's distance from the center of the overlap area, the less weight that competitor would\n\nreceive in the overall local market share calculations. Stated differently, because these distant\n\ncompetitors' market shares would only come into the calculation due to customers on the borders\n\nof the overlap area, those competitors' shares would be smaller than the shares of competitors\n\nwhose distribution centers were closer to the middle of the overlap area-namely, Sysco and USF.\n\n        When calculating market shares, Dr. Israel used three different metrics: (i) square footage\n\nof distribution centers; (ii) local broadline sales; and (iii) number of sales representatives.\n\nDr. Israel used the first and third variables as proxies for revenues and as a way to confirm the\n\nmarket share calculations that were based on the second variable, sales revenues. To calculate\n\nshares based on revenues, Dr. Israel used the Defendants' sales data for the numerator. For the\n\ndenominator, he used the sales numbers, where available, for local broadliners. For those local\n\ncompetitors for whom he did not have actual sales data, he estimated the sales revenue based on\n\nthe size of the distribution center. PX09350-134 at n.410. Based on those metrics, in local markets\n\nwith the 20 highest increases in pre-divestiture HHis, Defendants' combined market shares ranged\n\n\n\n\n                                                 73\n\f from 100 percent in San Diego, California, to over 65 percent in multiple markets. The HHI\n\n increases in each of top 20 markets were over 2,000 points. PX09350-135-137.\n\n        Dr. Israel also calculated post-divestiture market concentrations and HHI mcreases.\n\n According to the table below, in Memphis, Tennessee; Omaha, Nebraska; Sacramento, California;\n\n and Charleston, South Carolina, the post-divestiture combined markets shares remain above 80\n\npercent with HHI increases in excess of 4,100, 1,400, 2,900, and 2,900 points, respectively.\n\nPX09350-213, Table 21. In seven other local markets, Dr. Israel calculated the post-divestiture\n\ncombined market shares to be between 57 percent and 76 percent, with HHI increases in each case\n\nin excess of 1,500 points.

Defendants' Arguments\n\n       Defendants attack Dr. Israel's local market share calculations in much the same way they\n\ndid his national market share calculations-by contesting his methodology and inputs. Defendants\n\nassert that Dr. Israel's methodology was premised on the unreliable assumption that no competitor\n\n\n                                               74\n\f would drive a greater distance than Sysco or USF currently does to provide broadline services. In\n\n other words, they criticize Dr. Israel's use of the same draw radius to identify the relevant local\n\n competition as he did to identify the overlap area. As a result, they argue, Dr. Israel's local market\n\n share calculations excluded sales from broadliners who travel greater distances and thereby\n\noverstated Defendants' combined market shares.\n\n        To demonstrate this point, Dr. Bresnahan presented an analysis of the Omaha, Nebraska\n\nmarket. He testified that, according to Dr. Israel's analysis, Defendants had combined sales in\n\nOmaha of $95 million and a combined market share of 90 percent. According to Dr. Bresnahan,\n\nDr. Israel's methodology did not factor in at least -    million in sales by another local distributor,\n\nCash-Wa, whose distribution facility is 129 miles west of Omaha-farther out than the 91-mile\n\n75 percent draw radius that Dr. Israel had used for the area. Dr. Bresnahan based his conclusion\n\non sales data per zip code produced by Cash-Wa, which Dr. Israel had not considered in his\n\nanalysis. According to Dr. Bresnahan, the zip code data showed that in 2013, Cash-Wa made sales\n\nto customers in zip codes within the 75 percent overlap area-at least -        million worth-which\n\nDr. Israel did not account for because of his driving distance assumption. Had these Cash-Wa\n\nsales been taken into account, Defendants' combined market shares and increase in HHis would\n\nhave been lower. As illustrated by his Omaha study, Dr. Bresnahan concluded that Dr. Israel's\n\nlocal market share methodology produced unreliable results.\n\n       Dr. Bresnahan' s Omaha study convincingly demonstrated that Dr. Israel's 7 5 percent draw\n\narea methodology resulted in underreported competitor sales in the Omaha market. But what it\n\ndid not show convincingly was by how much. Dr. Bresnahan's initial expert report stated that\n\nCash-Wa's sales in the overlap area were over -         million. DX01359-139. At the evidentiary\n\nhearing, however, he said that Cash-Wa's sales into that area were \"at least -         million,\" DX-\n\n\n\n                                                 75\n\f 05029 at 42, and he did not explain why that number differed from his report. 25                                More\n\n fundamentally, Dr. Bresnahan's reliance on zip code data had its limits.                       As Dr. Bresnahan\n\n conceded, the zip code data did not differentiate between local and national customers or broadline\n\n and systems customers. Hr'g Tr. 2186. Dr. Israel explained that he did not use the zip code data\n\n for that very reason, as well as the additional reason that he did not have zip code data for all local\n\n market competitors. In addition, Cash-Wa does substantial business selling tobacco products;\n\n however, the zip code data does not segregate those sales. Id. As a result, although the court\n\n agrees with Defendants that Dr. Israel's methodology excluded some local broadline sales in\n\n Omaha, the court cannot reliably determine the extent of the underestimation. And, notably, even\n\n if Dr. Bresnahan's ti million figure consisted entirely of local broadline sales, Defendants would\n still have a high combined local market share of I percent ($95 million/(tl million + $95\n\n million)   =I percent).\n          Ultimately, the court finds that Dr. Israel's specific local market calculations is informative,\n\n but not conclusive evidence, of the merger's potential harm to local broadline customers. As the\n\nOmaha study showed, because Dr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology excluded some\n\ncompetitor sales and because each local market has nuances that cannot be captured by his\n\nmethodology, the court cannot rely conclusively on Dr. Israel's precise local share calculations as\n\na measure of competitive harm.\n\n         The court, however, finds variations on Dr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology to\n\nprovide persuasive evidence of the merger's impact on local markets. Dr. Israel did more than\n\n\n\n\n25\n   The court infers that the sales figure was reduced, in part, to estimate only Cash-Wa's broadline sales, as opposed\nto all sales. But that reason, if correct, was not made clear on the record. Additionally, in his report, Dr. Bresnahan\nreported over ti   million in sales by another broadliner, Reinhart. However, he made no mention ofReinhart's sales\n~That may be because Reinhart reported that\n~· PX09034-019.\n\n                                                          76\n\f calculate local share percentages based on 75 percent draw areas. He also used a 90 percent draw\n\n area and a weighted 95 percent draw area. Those increased draw areas captured some of the\n\n competitor sales that the 75 percent draw area excluded. 26 Dr. Israel then aggregated the local\n\n market share figures across all overlap customers in all markets, using distribution center square\n\n footage, adjusted revenues, and number of sales representatives to estimate market share.\n\n PX09350-137-139. As shown in the table below, 27 these alternative approaches-designated as\n\n variations (i) and (ii)-demonstrate that for half of the customers in overlap areas, Defendants\n\n would have a post-merger combined local market share of more than 50 percent and the HHI would\n\n increase at least 1,300 points. PX09350-139, Table 7. A quarter of the overlap customers would\n\n face even greater market concentrations: Defendants post-merger would have at least 68 percent\n\n in combined local market share and the HHI would increase by at least 2,000 points. And, 10\n\npercent of the overlap customers would face a combined market share north of 74 percent and an\n\nHHI increase of greater than 2,500 points. The picture that clearly emerges from these numbers\n\nis that, in many areas across the country, USF and Sysco already control a substantial share of the\n\nmarket for local broadline distribution. A merger between the two would lead to a significant\n\nincrease in market concentration in many areas.\n\n\n\n\n26\n   In a third variant, Dr. Israel went beyond the overlap areas and performed market calculations that took into account\nall local broadline customers, regardless of whether they fell into the overlap area. Dr. Israel also used a fourth\nvariant-though not entirely clear from his report-in which he appears to have re-run his 75 percent draw\nmethodology using all of Defendants' broadline customers in the overlap area, not just local broadline customers.\nPX09350-137-138.\n27\n   These figures are pre-divestiture share calculations. But the local market share percentages and HHI increases are\nso high that, even taking into account the divestiture, when aggregated across numerous markets, these figures are\nunlikely to decrease enough to change the overall picture.

For example, in an Investor Presentation,\n\ndated November 2012, USF represented that it \"estimated [having the] #1 or #2 position in- of\n\nserved markets.\" PX03000-014. Mr. Schreibman's investigational hearing testimony confirmed\n\nthe present-day accuracy of that statement Investigat'l Hr'g Tr., PX00515-017 at 65. He also\n\nconfirmed that, in many of those markets, Sysco occupied the number one or two market position.\n\nId\n\n                Another USF document, a strategy document created in 2011, shows USF and Sysco with\n\nsizeable \"market penetrations\" in many local markets.                                                                                                 PX03073-023-030. Mr. Schreibman\n\ntestified that \"market penetration\" was different from \"market share,\" as the former reflected the\n\npercentage of customers that purchased even $1 of product, whereas the latter reflected\n\n                                                                                                                       78\n\f percentages of overall sales volumes. Hr'g Tr. 1508-09. But even if \"market penetration\" and\n\n \"market share\" have different definitions, both concepts are a measure of market strength, and the\n\n\"market penetration\" percentages show USF and Sysco to be first and second in numerous markets.\n\nIndeed, the very same strategy document lists 54 separate markets and identifies Sysco as a\n\ncompetitor in each of them. Of those 54 markets, USF estimated that Sysco had the number one\n\nposition in   I   markets and that, within those   I    markets, USF was number two in   I·   USF also\n\nestimated that it was number one      inll markets, with Sysco ranked number two in those samell\nmarkets. And, in     II markets, USF viewed itself as tied for number one with Sysco.         Thus, of\n\nthe   I   local markets, USF viewed Sysco or USF as the leading broadliner inland as the number\n\ntwo broadliner (or tied for first)   inl. This internal assessment clearly supports Dr. Israel's local\nmarket share calculations.\n\n          Defendants offer a different ordinary course document to rebut Dr. Israel's market share\n\ncalculations. In 2013, relying on a sizeable third-party sales database of 335,000 independent\n\nrestaurants, USF calculated its share of sales to independent restaurants in 53 local markets. That\n\nstudy showed USF with market shares much lower than that shown by Dr. Israel's calculations,\n\nranging from a high     ofl percent in Columbia, South Carolina, to a low ofll percent in the\n\"Northwest.\" DX-00397-002.\n\n          But Defendants' reliance on the independent restaurant study as an indicator of local\n\nmarket shares is problematic for several reasons. First, there is no evidence that the underlying\n\ndatabase differentiated between purchases from broadline distributors and purchases from other\n\nchannels of distribution. The evidence has shown that, among foodservice customers, independent\n\nrestaurants are among the most likely to buy from other channels, such as specialty and cash-and-\n\ncarry. In other words, unless broadline sales are segregated from the rest-which the restaurant\n\n\n\n                                                       79\n\f study appears not to have done-the resulting market share estimate will underestimate USF' s\n\n actual share of only broadline purchases. A market share calculation that uses at its numerator\n\n purchases from all channels cannot be relied upon to determine USF's broadline market shares.\n\n          Second, no evidence was presented showing that the buying habits of independent\n\n restaurants is representative of other local broadline customers.      Thus, by focusing only on\n\nindependent restaurant purchasing, the data set does not provide an accurate picture oflocal market\n\nshares.\n\n          Third, the independent restaurant study's results conflict with other documents.      For\n\ninstance, USF's 2011 strategy document describes the company as having a \"[s]olid       4\" position\nin \"Reno/Sacramento,'' PX03073-019, but the restaurant study finds a less than 10 percent share\n\nin Reno, DX-00397-002. Similarly, the strategy document describes USF as having the             \"4\nposition\" in St. Louis, PX03073-018, but the restaurant study reported only a 13.3 percent share\n\nin the \"Missouri Group,\" DX-00397-002.\n\n          Finally, Dr. Israel's conclusions are corroborated by PFG's analysis of the local markets.\n\nIn January 2014, PFG made a presentation to the FTC in which it addressed the state of competition\n\nin various local markets. PFG, at the time, was represented by antitrust counsel, Kirkland & Ellis.\n\nBecause there was no comprehensive industry data for local market shares, PFG \"estimated local\n\nbroadline market shares based upon [distribution center] square footage, which PFGuses to gauge\n\ncompetitor strength in the ordinary course of business\"--one of the very methods that Dr. Israel\n\nused for calculating market shares. PX09045-019. PFG observed that, \"[w]hile not perfect, we\n\nbelieve this approach produces directionally correct results and can be useful in flagging areas\n\nthat merit closer consideration.\" Id (emphasis added). PFG's analysis showed that in six major\n\nmarkets-New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Denver, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles-a combined\n\n\n\n                                                 80\n\f Sysco-USP, based on distribution center square footage, would control between 45 percent (New\n\nYork City) to 80 percent (Las Vegas) of those local broadline markets. PX09045-020. PFG also\n\ncalculated that a merger in those markets would result in IIlil increases ranging from 1,000 points\n\n(New York City) to 3, 100 points (Las Vegas). Id Consistent with Dr. Israel's market shares and\n\nIIlil calculations, PFG concluded that the \"[p ]reliminary findings indicate significant\n\nconcentration in many local markets.\" Id\n\n               3.         The Court's Finding as to Local Broadline Customer Market Shares\n\n        The court thus finds, based on Dr. Israel's testimony and other evidence, that the FTC has\n\nshown that a merged Sysco-USP will significantly increase concentrations in local markets for\n\nbroadline distribution.     The FTC therefore has made its prima facie case and established a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the merger will lessen competition in the local markets.\n\n        C.     Additional Evidence of Competitive Harm\n\n        The FTC did not rely solely on increased IIllls to establish that Defendants' proposed\n\nmerger would cause competitive harm. See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 992 (\"The Herfindahl-\n\nHirschman Index cannot guarantee litigation victories.\").        It offered additional evidence to\n\nstrengthen its prima facie case, to which the court now turns.\n\n               I.      Unilateral Effects-National Customer Market\n\n       The FTC advanced a \"unilateral effects\" theory to argue that the merger would harm\n\ncompetition in both the national and local broadline distribution markets. In this section, the court\n\nconsiders the evidence of unilateral effects in the national customer market and subsequently turns\n\nto the evidence regarding local customer markets.\n\n       Courts have recognized that a merger that eliminates head-to-head competition between\n\nclose competitors can result in a substantial lessening of competition. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 717-\n\n\n\n                                                 81\n\f 19 (holding that elimination of competition between second- and third-largest jarred baby food\n\n manufacturers would weaken competition); Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 169 (finding a\n\n likelihood of unilateral price increase where merger would eliminate one of Swedish Match's\n\n\"primary direct competitors\"); Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1083 (finding anticompetitive effects where\n\nthe \"merger would eliminate significant head-to-head competition between the two lowest cost\n\nand lowest priced firms in the ... market.\"); see also Merger Guidelines § 6 (\"The elimination of\n\ncompetition between two firms that results from their merger may alone constitute a substantial\n\nlessening of competition.\").     In such circumstances, a merger \"is likely to have unilateral\n\nanticompetitive effect if the acquiring firm will have the incentive to raise prices or reduce quality\n\nafter the acquisition, independent of competitive responses from other firms.\" H&R Block, 833 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 81.\n\n       Unilateral anticompetitive effects can arise in a host of different settings. See generally\n\nMerger Guidelines § 6. Here, the FTC's case for unilateral effects rests on the fact that the\n\nbroadline distribution industry is marked by negotiations between buyers and sellers. In such a\n\nmarket, \"buyers commonly negotiate with more than one seller, and may play sellers off against\n\none another.\" Id § 6.2. If two competitors merge, buyers will be prevented from playing the\n\nsellers off one another in negotiations. See id This elimination of competition \"can significantly\n\nenhance the ability and incentive of the merged entity to obtain a result more favorable to it, and\n\nless favorable to the buyer, than the merging firms would have offered separately absent the\n\nmerger.\" Id\n\n       On the other hand, even if the merging parties had large market shares, if they were not\n\nparticularly close competitors, then the market shares might overstate the extent to which the\n\nmerger would harm competition. Although the merging parties need not be the top two firms to\n\n\n\n                                                 82\n\f cause unilateral effects, see, e.g., Heinz, 246 F.3d at 717-19; H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 83-\n\n 84, the FTC argues that the potential for unilateral effects here is magnified because Defendants\n\n are particularly close competitors and many national customers consider them the top two choices\n\nfor broadline distribution. See Merger Guidelines § 6.2 (\"Anticompetitive unilateral effects ...\n\nare likely in proportion to the frequency or probability with which, prior to the merger, one of the\n\nmerging sellers had been the runner-up when the other won the business.\").\n\n          The FTC offered various sources of evidence to show that the proposed merger will result\n\nin unilateral anticompetitive effects. The evidence includes empirical data collected and analyzed\n\nby Dr. Israel, Defendants' ordinary course documents, and testimonial evidence from other market\n\nactors.\n\n                        a.     Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding study\n\n          To show that Defendants were frequent head-to-head competitors-indeed, each other's\n\nclosest rivals-Dr. Israel analyzed each company's bidding opportunities for national customers\n\nbased on the RFP/bidding database that he compiled from the companies' records.                The\n\nRFP/bidding records that Dr. Israel collected spanned a seven-year period, from 2007 to 2014.\n\nPX09375-088. He formed the database not only from the parties' reconstructed RFP data, but also\n\nfrom a host of ordinary course records reflecting bidding opportunities, PX09375-089-091. From\n\nthis evidence, Dr. Israel concluded: \"[I]n competitions for National Broadline Customer business,\n\nboth USF and Sysco compete with and lose to one another much more than they compete with or\n\nlose to any other distributor and, indeed, more than all other distributors combined.\" PX09375-\n\n088. More specifically, based on Sysco's RFP/bidding records, Dr. Israel observed that USF\n\nappeared as a competitor for national broadline business twice as often as the next competitor and\n\nthat, when Sysco lost, it lost to USF two and a half times more often than it lost to the next\n\n\n\n                                                83\n\f competitor.   Similarly, based on USF's RFP/bidding records, Dr. Israel observed that Sysco\n\n appeared as a competitor for national broadline business four times as often as the next competitor\n\nand that, when USF lost, it lost to Sysco three and a half times more often than it lost to the next\n\ncompetitor. PX09350-105-109.\n\n        Defendants disputed the reliability of Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding data study in two primary\n\nways. First, as already discussed, they forcefully challenged the underlying data set, arguing that\n\nneither company keeps ordinary course RFP and bidding records and that Dr. Israel's reliance on\n\nthese artificially created data sets to calculate an empirical \"win-loss\" analysis is inherently flawed.\n\nAs previously explained, the court has found that drawing precise conclusions based on the\n\nRFP/bidding data is problematic because of the data's limitations.\n\n        Second, to demonstrate that the merger would not create unilateral anticompetitive effects,\n\nDefendants offered a \"switching study\" conducted by Dr. Bresnahan. A switching study, as the\n\nname implies, analyzes customers' decision to \"switch\" their business to other competitors. For\n\nhis study, Dr. Bresnahan acquired from a company called Aggdata the location information of tens\n\nof thousands of restaurant and hotel chain customers that are on either Sysco's or USF's \"national\n\ncustomer\" roster. He then analyzed Defendants' transaction records by quarter from the first\n\nquarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2013 to determine if either company provided broadline\n\ndistribution to a specific restaurant or hotel location. If either Defendant provided broadline\n\ndistribution, he tracked the company's sales to the location and noted if it lost sales to the location\n\nduring the period. If the company lost sales in a particular quarter, he checked the other defendant\n\ncompany's transaction records to see if it picked up the customer. If it did not, Dr. Bresnahan\n\nassumed that some other competitor did.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  84\n\f            So, for example, if USF's records showed that a particular Sonic franchise did not purchase\n\n from USF in a particular quarter, he would tum to Sysco's records to see if Sysco had picked up\n\n the customer; if it did, he counted it as a switch to Sysco; if not, he assumed that the customer\n\n purchased from another distributor and counted it as a switch to a competitor other than Sysco.\n\n Based on this analysis, Dr. Bresnahan concluded that Sysco and USF are not uniquely close\n\n competitors. He found that USF lost business to Sysco 15 percent of the time based on both\n\n revenue and number oflocations, and that Sysco lost business to USF 57 percent of the time based\n\n on revenue and 39 percent of the time based on number of locations. These percentages of\n\n switches, Dr. Bresnahan testified, were much lower than what one would have expected to see if\n\n Dr. Israel's national market shares were accurate.\n\n            For a variety ofreasons, the court cannot agree with Dr. Bresnahan's ultimate conclusion-\n\nthat USF and Sysco are not uniquely close competitors-based on his switching study. First,\n\nthough the number of observations in Dr. Bresnahan's study were significant, they were limited\n\nalmost exclusively to restaurant and hotel locations (including, it appears, restaurants served by\n\nSysco's systems division, SYGMA). 28 The observations did not include other types of large\n\nnational customers, such as GPOs, foodservice management companies, and large government\n\nagencies, which, as the evidence showed, spend large percentages of their foodservice distribution\n\nbudget on Defendants. As Dr. Bresnahan admitted, he does not claim that his switching analysis\n\nreflects the buying habits of these national customers. Hr'g Tr. 2180-82.\n\n           Second, the time period of Dr. Bresnahan' s study-two-and-a-half years-is shorter than\n\nthe seven-year time period covered by Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding analysis. Significant switches that\n\n\n\n\n28\n     The study did include one health care organization, Kaiser Permanente, and one GPO, Amerinet.\n\n                                                         85\n\f might have occurred between Defendants outside the two-and-a-half year period, therefore, were\n\nnot counted.\n\n        Third, the switching analysis does not capture the full extent of competition between\n\nDefendants (or between other competitors, for that matter), because it only tracks switches, not\n\ninstances where a customer might have played one broadliner off the other to get better pricing.\n\nThat kind of situation reflects actual competition at least as much as a switch, but such competition\n\nis not reflected in the data.\n\n        Fourth, unlike an RFP or bid situation, a switch does not necessarily equate to actual\n\ncompetition. A switch might have occurred for any number of reasons having nothing to do with\n\npricing or service (e.g., the customer's sister-in-law went to work for a competitor), but the study\n\ntreats every switch as a loss for competitive reasons.\n\n        Fifth, Dr. Israel's rebuttal report pointed out a number of limitations in Dr. Bresnahan's\n\nswitching analysis, including the exclusion of certain switches between Defendants and the\n\ntreatment of actual switches, such as timed phase outs from one Defendant to the other, as non-\n\nswitches.   PX09375-08 l-084.     Although Dr. Bresnahan testified that he corrected for these\n\ncriticisms and that the adjustments did not materially alter his results or conclusion, the need for\n\nthose adjustments reflects the limitations of drawing firm conclusions from such undifferentiated\n\ndata.\n\n        Finally, Dr. Bresnahan's conclusion that USF and Sysco are not close competitors brings\n\nhim into conflict with Defendants' other expert, Dr. Hausman. Dr. Bresnahan testified that,\n\nalthough he agrees that Sysco and USF are competitors, he did not think that one was a\n\n\"particularly strong price constraint\" on the other. Hr'g Tr. 2183. Dr. Hausman, on the other\n\nhand, unequivocally agreed that \"USF is a strong price constraint on Sysco.\" Id. at 2005. He\n\n\n\n                                                86\n\f testified Sysco and USF \"compete and they compete hard. I'd be the first to agree.\" Id. at 1986;\n\n see id. at 2037 (\"I am not arguing with you that-or disagreeing with you that Sysco and US Foods\n\n are important competitive constraints on each other.\").        Defendants do not explain how\n\nDr. Bresnahan's switching study can be reconciled with Dr. Hausman's unqualified opinion that\n\nDefendants mutually constrain each other's prices, which can only mean that they are close\n\ncompetitors; if they were not, the pricing of one would not matter to the other.\n\n        In the end, the court finds that Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding analysis is more persuasive than\n\nDr. Bresnahan's switching study. Both empirical studies are imperfect for the reasons already\n\ndiscussed. But Dr. Israel's analysis better captures instances of actual competition across a more\n\nrepresentative cross-section of national customers over a longer period of time.     Additionally,\n\nDr. Israel's conclusions are corroborated by other evidence in the record, which, as discussed\n\nbelow, indicate that Sysco and USF are close competitors, particularly for large national\n\ncustomers.\n\n                       b.     The parties' ordinary course documents\n\n       The FTC presented ordinary course documents, from both Defendants and third parties,\n\nwhich support Dr. Israel's conclusion that Sysco and USF are particularly close competitors. For\n\nexample, a 2012 USF presentation, titled \"Strategy Refresh,\" explains that one reason for strategic\n\nrethinking is that \"[c]ustomers perceive little difference between us and our main competitor,\"\n\nidentified as Sysco. PX0303 l-003 (emphasis added). The same presentation devotes a section to\n\n\"Performance v. Sysco\" and describes the companies as \"[i]ndustry leaders.\" PX0303 l-010-0l l.\n\nAnother USF document describes Sysco as USF's \"major rival.\" PX03032-043.\n\n       Similarly, a Sysco presentation to its Board of Directors describes USF as its \"next largest\n\ncompetitor\" and puts forth \"recent intelligence\" about USF and two other competitors. PX01007-\n\n\n\n                                                87\n\f 018; PX01007-023. Another Sysco strategy document focusing on the healthcare sector states that\n\n \"US Foodservice is our strongest competitor for Healthcare GPO dollars.\" PX01388-004.             In\n\n addition, there are many specific instances in the record demonstrating fierce competition between\n\n Sysco and USF for national customer accounts. 29 These documents indicate that Sysco and USF\n\n compete aggressively against one another on price; non-price incentives, such as signing bonuses;\n\n service; and other value-added offerings.\n\n           Industry analysts also have recognized the close competition between Defendants.\n\n For instance, the Cleveland Research Group's January 2014 market report on Sysco noted the\n\n Cleveland Research Group's assessment that \"both Sysco and US Foods have priced each other\n\n down competing for larger national/regional contract accounts over the last several years\" and that\n\n\"the acquisition removes a key price competitor (particularly with larger contract accounts).\"\n\nPX09332-004.\n\n                           c.      Testimonial evidence\n\n           A number of industry actors testified that they view Sysco and USF to be close competitors\n\nfor national customers. Particularly compelling testimony came from Mark Allen, the head of the\n\nfoodservice distributors' trade group, IFDA. In his deposition, Mr. Allen agreed that Sysco and\n\nUSF were \"closest competitors\" for national accounts, such as GPOs, hospitality, and foodservice\n\nmanagement companies. PX00570-012; PX00570-014. He further described Sysco and USF as\n\n\"powerful competitors\" for independent customers, PX00570-l 13, and testified that, in his\n\nexperience, GPOs, foodservice management companies, and hospitality chains use Sysco and USF\n\nto keep each other honest on price and service, PX00570-019. The testimony of the PFG's\n\nPresident and CEO, George Holm, was to the same effect. He testified that in his experience\n\n\n29\n     See, e.g., PX01066-001-002; PX03064-001; PX01061-001-006.\n\n\n                                                     88\n\f \"foodservice management companies, GPOs[,] and certain restaurant groups\" have \"obtained\n\n lower prices by bidding Sysco and US Foods against each other.\" Hr' g Tr. 651.\n\n                        d.      Conclusion on unilateral effects in the national customer market\n\n        The court's finding that Sysco and USF are close competitors in the national customer\n\n market is no surprise, given the uncontested facts of this case. Sysco and USF are the country's\n\ntwo largest broadliners by any measure. They have far more distribution centers, SKUs, private\n\nlabel products, sales representatives, and delivery trucks than any other broadline distributor. That\n\nthey rely on these competitive advantages to compete, and compete aggressively against one\n\nanother in the market for national customers, is amply born out on this record.\n\n        Based on all of the evidence presented, the court finds that, because the proposed merger\n\nwould eliminate head-to-head competition between the number one and number two competitors\n\nin the market for national customers, the merger is likely to lead to unilateral anticompetitive\n\neffects in that market. Evidence of probable unilateral effects strengthens the FTC's primafacie\n\ncase that the merger will lessen competition in the national customer market. See Heinz, 246 F.3d\n\nat 717 (footnote omitted) (finding that \"the FTC's market concentration statistics are bolstered by\n\nthe indisputable fact that the merger will eliminate competition between the two merging parties\");\n\nWhole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1043 (Tatel, J.) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(stating that \"there can be little doubt that the acquisition of the second largest firm in the market\n\nby the largest firm in the market will tend to harm competition in that market\").\n\n               2.      Merger Simulation Model-National Customer Market\n\n       To further show that the merger would harm national customers, Dr. Israel ran a merger\n\nsimulation model to predict the merger's effect. Dr. Israel used an \"auction model\" to estimate the\n\nharm to national customers based on his real-world observation that national customers used RFP\n\n\n\n                                                 89\n\f processes that \"typically involve[ d] competitive bids and bilateral negotiations between distributors\n\nand foodservice operators\" to award business. PX09350-l 10. Under an auction model, the terms\n\noffered by the winning bidder are determined (or at least heavily influenced) by the second-best\n\nbidder, because the winning bidder will offer price and service terms that are just good enough to\n\nwin the business. In theory, if the top two bidders merge, price and service terms will be determined\n\n(or at least heavily influenced) by the previously third-best bidder, who in a post-merger world\n\nwould move into the number two spot. An auction model predicts harm to customers if, as here,\n\nthe top two bidders merge and the next best bidder is a distant third. The magnitude of the harm is\n\ndefined as the difference between the values offered by the companies that had been the pre-merger\n\nsecond- and third-place bidders. PX09350-113-l 14; see CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 69\n\n(describing a similar auction model for predicting a price increase).\n\n        Practically speaking, the premise of Dr. Israel's auction model was that, in the pre-merger\n\nworld, Sysco and USF are national customers' top two choices and, therefore, each company sets\n\nthe other company's price. But, if they were to merge, the winning bidder's price would only be\n\nsubject to competitive pressure by a pre-merger third-place bidder, such as PFG or some other\n\ndistant competitor. If the next best bidder is not a major competitor, and therefore does not play a\n\nsignificant role in affecting prices, national customers will be harmed. An email dated December\n\n12, 2013, summarizing a \"USF Senior Teams\" webcast addressing the proposed merger, perfectly\n\ncaptures this core premise of Dr. Israel's model. The email identified as one of the \"key messages\":\n\n\"The 'distance' between the combined company and the next set of regional players is huge. Those\n\nregional players will have an even harder time trying to play catch up going forward because they\n\nsimply won't have the resources that the combined company has to transform the industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                 90\n\f PXOO 103-002 (emphasis added). The \"huge\" distance between the merged entity and the rest of\n\n the field corresponds to the merger harm that Dr. Israel's model predicts.\n\n        To quantify the likely harm to national customers, Dr. Israel performed calculations that\n\n used as inputs, among others, his estimates of the parties' national customer market shares and their\n\nprice-cost margins. PX09350-118. He concluded that, absent significant efficiencies and other\n\nmitigating factors, the merger would harm national customers on the order of more than $1. 4 billion\n\nannually. PX09350-120; PX09350-220. Factoring in the divestiture to PFG and its increased\n\nmarket share, Dr. Israel calculated likely merger harm of more than $900 million annually.\n\nPX09350-l 89; PX093 50-237.\n\n        Defendants assert that Dr. Israel's model is flawed for the same reason that they criticize his\n\nnational market share calculations-both rely on the unreliable RFP/bidding data. Specifically,\n\nDefendants argue that, because the merger simulation model relies on the national market share\n\ncalculations as a critical input, and because those market shares depend on the unreliable\n\nRFP/bidding data, Dr. Israel's estimate of likely merger harm is likewise unreliable. As discussed,\n\nthe court agrees that the RFP/bidding data set is imperfect and its resulting market share calculations\n\nare imprecise to some degree. Dr. Israel's most conservative market share analysis, however, did\n\nnot rely on the RFP/bidding data but rather on the CID data, and provided a reasonable\n\napproximation of the parties' share of the national customer market. Dr. Israel ran his merger\n\nsimulation using that lower-bound market share estimate and still reached the conclusion that,\n\nabsent significant efficiencies, the merger would likely cause significant harm. PX093 50-121 n.363\n\n(\"Finally, I tested the robustness of my results to Sysco and USF having lower combined shares. I\n\nfound that even when I use the lowest (and almost certainly too low) Sysco and USF shares\n\npresented in Table 1, the required efficiencies predicted by the model still far outweigh the\n\n\n\n                                                 91\n\f efficiencies claimed by the parties.\"). The court, therefore, concludes that Dr. Israel's merger\n\n simulation model strengthens the FTC's primafacie case that the merger will substantially lessen\n\n competition in the market for national customers.\n\n                3.     Unilateral Effects-Local Markets\n\n        As it did for the national customer market, the FTC presented empirical, documentary, and\n\ntestimonial evidence to demonstrate the potential for unilateral effects to harm local markets. That\n\nevidence, however, presented a more muddled picture of the potential for unilateral effects than\n\ndid the evidence for the national customer market.\n\n                       a.      Dr. Israel's empirical analysis\n\n        As he did with the national customer market, Dr. Israel looked at Defendants' business\n\nrecords to determine how closely they compete in local markets. The data came from two\n\nsources-USF's Linc database and Sysco's request for incentives (RFI) records.             The Linc\n\ndatabase, as discussed earlier, is a customer relations management tool used by USF sales\n\npersonnel to manage and store information on existing and prospective customer accounts. RFis\n\nare internal Sysco records that sales personnel were required to submit to regional presidents to\n\nobtain approval to offer incentives to customers to either switch to Sysco or stay with the company.\n\n       Starting with the Linc database, Dr. Israel observed and analyzed nearly 100,000 business\n\nopportunities between January 2011 and June 2014 and divided them into two groups-USP wins\n\nand USF losses. When USF won the business, sales personnel identified Sysco as the main\n\ncompetitor 43 percent of the time (and 48 percent of the time measured by revenue); when USF\n\nlost the business, USF sales personnel identified Sysco as the main competitor 46 percent of the\n\ntime (and 68 percent of the time measured by revenue). PX09350-143, Table 11. Whether USF\n\nwon or lost, sales personnel identified Sysco as the main competitor eight times more frequently\n\n\n\n                                                92\n\f than the next most mentioned competitors (PFG and Gordon Food Service). Dr. Israel also\n\n segregated the Linc database's mentions of competitors in 20 local markets. That study showed\n\n that sales personnel in every market identified Sysco as USF's main competitor by a wide margin,\n\n especially when measured by revenues. PX09350-145, Table 14.\n\n         The RFI data painted a similar picture from the Sysco perspective. Dr. Israel reviewed 224\n\n Sysco RFis, covering a three-year period from 2011 to 2014, when Sysco discontinued the\n\n practice. In more than 66 percent of the RFis, Sysco sales personnel identified USF as the reason\n\n for the incentive request.      No other competitor appeared more than 10 percent of the time.\n\nPX09350-146-147.\n\n         Defendants attacked Dr. Israel's reliance on the Linc database, as they did when he used it\n\nin his aggregate diversion analysis. They asserted that Dr. Israel improperly relied on the Linc\n\ndatabase as a win-loss record, when it was never intended as such. USF's Executive Vice President\n\nof Strategy, David Schreibman, testified that sales people did not use the database consistently and\n\nwould sometimes enter competitor information simply to fill in the database; ultimately, USF did\n\nnot rely on it to identify market competition. Hr'g Tr. 1505-06. Defendants also presented a local\n\nswitching study performed by Dr. Bresnahan, which used the same switching methodology as\n\ndescribed above but applied to local customers.               According to Dr. Bresnahan, when local\n\ncustomers switch away from Sysco, they switch to USF only 11 percent of the time; and when\n\nthey switch away from USF, they switch to Sysco only 15 percent of the time. Hr'g Tr. 2163. In\n\nother words, according to Dr. Bresnahan's switching analysis, when local customers switched\n\naway from Sysco it was typically to distributors other than USF. 30\n\n\n30\n   Dr. Bresnahan also did another switching study to support his findings. He conducted a study of fresh chicken\npurchases by customers in San Diego, from which he concluded that customers \"tum off and on buying fresh chicken\nfrom Sysco\" and that most of the time when they \"tum off' Sysco they buy from someone other than USF. Hr'g Tr.\n2162.\n\n                                                      93\n\f        The court finds that the empirical evidence, on balance, shows that Sysco and USF are\n\nclose competitors for local customers. As the court has already observed, relying on the Linc\n\ndatabase to draw firm conclusions is problematic for the reasons raised by Defendants. That said,\n\neven recognizing the data's limitations, it so overwhelmingly demonstrated primary competition\n\nbetween Sysco and USF based on a sizeable number of observations (nearly 100,000 entries) that\n\nit cannot be wholly disregarded as evidence of close competition. Furthermore, the court found\n\nthe RFI analysis especially compelling; indeed, Defendants did little to contest it. Although the\n\nnumber of observations was low, the RFI data overwhelmingly showed Sysco seeking incentives\n\nto attract or keep local customers in response to USF' s efforts far more often than Sysco attempted\n\nto respond to any other competitor's efforts.\n\n       Dr. Bresnahan's switching study provided some counterweight to Dr. Israel's work. Like\n\nhis national switching analysis, however, it did not account for competition when customers used\n\nSysco and USF as leverage against each other, as many local customers said regularly occurred.\n\nThe local switching study also relied heavily on chain restaurants and hotels and thus did not factor\n\nin the buying habits of other types of local customers, particularly independent restaurants.\n\nTherefore, notwithstanding the limits of the data sets relied on by Dr. Israel, the court finds that\n\nthe empirical evidence supports the conclusion that Sysco and USF are close competitors in local\n\nmarkets.\n\n                       b,     The parties' ordinaiy course documents\n\n       Two notable ordinary course documents also support the conclusion that Sysco and USF\n\nare close competitors for local customers.       The first is USF's November 2012 \"Investor\n\nPresentation,\" which represented that \"US Foods is estimated #1 or #2 position in     II of served\nmarkets.\" PX03000-014; see also PX03l18-006. As previously noted, USF's David Schreibman\n\n\n\n                                                94\n\f confirmed both the present-day accuracy of that statement and the fact that, in many of those\n\n markets, Sysco occupied the number one or two position. DX-00272 at 62, 65. The second is the\n\nJuly 2011 USF acquisitions strategy document, which estimated USF's position in 54 separate\n\nmarkets, apparently based on market penetration rather than market share. USF estimated that\n\neither Sysco or USF was the leading broadliner in       I   of those markets and was the number two\n\nbroadliner (or tied for first) in   I·   See also PX03002-009 (Clayton, Dubilier & Rice document,\n\ntitled \"Operating Review,\" acknowledging that one of Sysco's strengths is \"[g]eographic coverage\n\nin all the key markets in the U.S. - #1 or #2 in virtually all the markets in which they operate\");\n\nPX03004-001 (Clayton, Dublier & Rice memo stating that USF is a \"leader in both national and\n\nlocal markets\" and that \"Sysco [is the] closest competitor with similar business mix\"). Sysco's\n\nand USF's leading positions in multiple local markets shows that they are close competitors in\n\nthose markets.\n\n                        c.      Testimonial evidence\n\n        The testimonial evidence was more equivocal about the closeness of competition between\n\nDefendants. It demonstrated that Sysco and USF are strong competitors for local customers in\n\nseveral markets, but it also showed that other broadliners are competing effectively in many of\n\nthose areas.     The FTC's case featured four local markets:        (i) Columbia/Charleston, South\n\nCarolina; (ii) Omaha, Nebraska; (iii) Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina; and (iv) Southwest\n\nVirginia.   For each of those markets, the FTC presented testimonial evidence supporting\n\nDefendants' leading market positions. For instance, PFG's George Holm agreed that Sysco and\n\nUSF were the largest and two most \"competitively significant\" broadline distributors in\n\nColumbia/Charleston, Raleigh/Durham, and Southwest Virginia. Hr'g Tr. 653-57; DX-00276 at\n\n70-72. Mark Allen, IFDA President, agreed with those assessments, calling Defendants the\n\n\n\n                                                   95\n\f \"dominant\" or \"strongest\" competitors in those three markets (and Las Vegas). DX-00294 at 170;\n\n see also Hr'g Tr. 1800 (testimony from Sysco Mid-Atlantic President Mike Brawner stating that\n\n USF is a \"strong competitor\" in Columbia, Raleigh/Durham). USF's ordinary course materials\n\n corroborate those observations, at least in terms of market penetration.                      PX03 ll 8-007-008\n\n (showing USF as a \"Strong        4,\" based on market penetration, in Raleigh, Columbia, and Roanoke,\n with Sysco as number two in those areas, and showing Sysco as the number one broadliner in\n\n Omaha with USF a \"Distant         4\").\n          Yet, when customer-level testimony is considered, the evidence of Defendants' leading\n\n market positions and their post-merger ability to increase prices becomes less clear. Both sides\n\ndeposed and obtained numerous declarations from various customers in these local markets. The\n\ncustomer testimony obtained by the FTC invariably decried the merger's impact on local markets,\n\nwhereas Defendants' customer witnesses emphasized alternatives in the marketplace and the\n\nability to switch broadliners if the merged company attempted to impose a price increase. 31\n\n\n\n\n 31\n    Compare PX07020-002 (Champ McGee, owner of Little Pigs Barbeque and FTC-sponsored declarant expressing\n \"serious concerns\" about merger's effect on business in the Columbia market), and Hr'g Tr. 344 (FTC witness, Gary\n Hoffman, Vice President and Corporate Executive Chef of Upstream Brewing Company from the Omaha market,\n expressing concern that the proposed merger would prevent him from playing Defendants off one another), and\n PX00487-005 (FTC-sponsored declarant Jason Smith of 18 Restaurant Group, from the Raleigh/Durham market,\nexpressing concerning about the merger \"because it eliminates one of our only two options for broadline distribution\nservices\" and rejects other competitors), and Hr'g Tr. 544-45 (FTC witness, Daniel Schablein, Controller at\nWintergreen Resort from the southwestern Virginia market, stating that Sysco and USF were the only legitimate\nbroadliners for his business), with DX-00227 at 2 (Justin Brooks, owner of Frayed Knot Restaurant and Defendants-\nsponsored declarant, stating \"I do not believe that Sysco could raise prices or reduce services on my business\" in the\nColumbia market because of competition from PFG, Merchants, Reinhart, and Gordon Food Service), and DX-00191\nat 2 (Defendants-sponsored declarant Anthony Fucinaro of Anthony's Steakhouse, from the Omaha market, stating,\n\"If Sysco were to raise prices or lower service levels, I would move my contract to Reinhart, Martin Brothers, and/or\nCash-Wa\"), andDX-00232 at 2 (Defendants-sponsored declarant Patrick Cowden of Tobacco Road Sports Cafe, from\nthe Raleigh/Durham market stating, \"If Sysco tried to raise prices or decrease service quality following the merger, I\ncould and would replace them with any of the other bidders in a heartbeat\"), and DX-00209 at 1 (Defendants-\nsponsored declaration from George Huger of Southern Inn Restaurant, from the southwestern Virginia market, stating\nthat he would have alternatives, including PFG and Staunton Foods, ifhe became dissatisfied with Sysco's prices or\nservice after the merger).\n\n                                                         96\n\f Because of these conflicting local market assessments, the court cannot draw firm conclusions\n\n about the competitiveness of the local broadline markets from the testimonial evidence. 32\n\n                             d.       Conclusion on unilateral effects in the local markets\n\n          In the final analysis, after considering all of the record evidence on local markets, the court\n\n finds that the FTC has shown that unilateral effects are likely to occur in many local markets\n\n because the merger will eliminate one of the top competitors in those markets. Though the court\n\n finds the evidence of unilateral effects in the local markets to be less convincing than in the national\n\n customer market, the evidence nevertheless strengthens the FTC's prima facie case of merger\n\n harm.\n\n                   4.       Local Event Studies\n\n          To further show that the merger would adversely impact local customers, the FTC\n\npresented the results of an econometric event study conducted by Dr. Israel. Dr. Israel analyzed\n\n Sysco's opening of two distribution centers-one in Long Island, New York, in July 2012, and\n\none in Riverside, California, in June 2013-to determine the impact those openings had on prices\n\npaid by USF customers served from a nearby competing facility. Known as an \"entry study,\"\n\nDr. Israel selected the Long Island and Riverside events because they were the only two recent\n\ninstances in which Sysco had opened a new distribution center in the same market as a USF\n\ndistribution center. From these event studies, the FTC hoped to show that prices fell when Sysco\n\nand USF directly competed and that the merger's elimination ofUSF as a competitor would have\n\nan upward effect on pricing.\n\n\n\n32\n   The FTC did not present testimony or customer declarations about many of the markets that it claims will be highly\nconcentrated after the merger. That is not, however, fatal to its case. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 339, 341 (rejecting\nthe argument that the government had not proven its case because it did not present evidence \"in each line of commerce\nand each section of the country\" and stating that \"[t]here is no reason to protract already complex antitrust litigation\nby detailed analyses of peripheral economic facts, if the basic issues of the case may be determined through study of\na fair sample\").\n\n                                                          97\n\f           Dr. Israel found that Sysco' s entry in Long Island resulted in a 1.4 percent decline in USF' s\n\nprices for customers in the 75 percent overlap area. PX09350-148. He also ran variations of his\n\nregression analysis on other groupings---customers within a 50 percent overlap area, customers\n\npurchasing more than 100 SKUs, and customers buying private label products-and found that the\n\nprice decrease on these groupings was even greater. PX093 50-148. By contrast, Dr. Israel found\n\na less significant price impact in the Riverside entry study-a negligible price decline of only .06\n\npercent.\n\n        Dr. Israel explained that neither of these events were clean entry studies because, in both\n\ncases, Sysco already had an existing distribution facility in the area, and thus already was\n\ncompeting against USF.         In his opinion, the resulting price effects, therefore, were actually\n\nunderstated. Dr. Israel also found the results of the Long Island event more compelling than the\n\nRiverside event for two reasons. First, the Long Island facility was a greater distance away from\n\nSysco's existing facility than the new Riverside facility was from its existing facility. Second, the\n\nLong Island facility served more new business than the Riverside facility. For those reasons, he\n\nconcluded, the Long Island study better approximated a true entry event. Hr'g Tr. 1097-98.\n\nDr. Israel ultimately concluded, based largely on the Long Island study, that the merger's\n\nelimination of USF as a competitor would have an upward pricing effect in local markets.\n\n       The court does not find Dr. Israel's entry studies to be convincing evidence that the merger\n\nwill harm local customers. Dr. Israel's efforts to distinguish the Long Island and Riverside events\n\nsimply do not hold up. Defendants' expert, Dr. Bresnahan, showed that the difference in distance\n\nbetween the Riverside facility and its nearby existing facility, on the one hand, and the Long Island\n\nfacility and its nearby existing facility, on the other, was a mere 14 miles. He also showed that\n\nboth new Sysco facilities served a similar fraction of existing Sysco customers. Thus, the two\n\n\n\n                                                    98\n\f entry events were not as dissimilar as Dr. Israel testified, yet they produced very different results-\n\n one showing a significant price decrease, the other showing a negligible one. There may be\n\n location-specific reasons for the different results, but the reasons offered by Dr. Israel do not\n\n withstand scrutiny and no other evidence explained the difference. The court thus cannot conclude\n\n from these seemingly conflicting entry studies that the merger will harm local customers.\n\n        The court further notes that the pricing evidence here is far weaker than that found in other\n\nmerger cases. In Staples, for instance, there was \"compelling evidence\" showing that prices were\n\n 13 percent higher in markets where Staples did not have competition from another office\n\nsuperstore. 970 F. Supp. at 1075-76 (pricing study). Similarly, in Whole Foods, an entry study\n\nshowed that Whole Foods dropped its prices by five percent when another organic supermarket\n\nopened in the area. 548 F.3d at 1046-47 (Tatel, J.). In fairness, the FTC was unable to conduct\n\npricing studies like those done in Staples and Whole Foods here because Defendants have\n\ncompeting facilities in nearly every local market. But the absence of convincing pricing effects\n\nevidence is the weakest aspect of the FTC's case.\n\n                5.     Summaty\n\n        In summary, the FTC has bolstered its prima facie case with additional proof that the merger\n\nwould harm competition in both the national and local broadline markets. Although the FTC's case\n\nwould have been strengthened with more convincing pricing effects evidence, the court\n\nnevertheless finds that the FTC has presented a compelling prima facie case of anticompetitive\n\neffects. See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991 (\"The more compelling the prima facie case, the more\n\nevidence the defendant must present to rebut it successfully.\"). The court now turns to Defendants'\n\nrebuttal arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 99\n\f III.   DEFENDANTS' REBUTIAL ARGUMENTS\n\n        The FTC has established a presumption that the proposed merger will substantially lessen\n\ncompetition. Defendants, however, may rebut that presumption by showing that the traditional\n\neconomic theories of the competitive effects of market concentration are not an accurate indicator\n\nof the merger's probable effect on competition or that the procompetitive effects of the merger are\n\nlikely to outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715. The more\n\n\"compelling the [FTC's] prima facie case, the more evidence the defendant must present to rebut\n\n[the presumption] successfully.\" Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991. \"A defendant can make the\n\nrequired showing by affirmatively showing why a given transaction is unlikely to substantially\n\nlessen competition, or by discrediting the data underlying the initial presumption in the\n\ngovernment's favor.\" Id\n\n        Defendants advance four arguments to support their claim that the food industry will\n\nremain competitive after the merger: (i) a post-divestiture PFG will be a strong competitor for\n\ncustomers seeking nationwide distribution; (ii) competition from other broadliners and other\n\ndistribution channels will continue and grow; (iii) the entry of new competition and the\n\nrepositioning of existing competitors will keep the industry competitive; and (iv) customers will\n\nbenefit from efficiencies arising from the merger. The court addresses each of those arguments in\n\ntum and finds that, even taken collectively, Defendants cannot overcome the FTC's strong\n\npresumption of anticompetitive harm.\n\n        A.     PFG Divestiture\n\n        Aside from the Supreme Court's guidance that \"[t]he relief in an antitrust case must be\n\n'effective to redress the violations' and 'to restore competition,\"' Ford Motor Co. v.

Compare CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 56-59 (applying\n\nthe framework for market entry analysis in assessing the effectiveness of a licensing agreement\n\nthat would enhance the competitiveness of an existing competitor) with FTC v.

Supp. 2d 34, 47-48 (D.D.C. 2002) (finding defendants' proposed \"fix\" inadequate-without\n\ngoing into market entry analysis-because competitor would face higher costs).\n\n       Here, both sides cite to the 2004 U.S. Department of Justice's \"Policy Guide to Merger\n\nRemedies,\" which provides the following guidance: \"Restoring competition requires replacing\n\nthe competitive intensity lost as a result of the merger rather than focusing narrowly on returning\n\nto premerger HHl levels.\" Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Division Policy Guide\n\nto Merger Remedies 5 (Oct. 2004) [hereinafter 2004 Policy Guide] (emphasis added); see also\n\nAreeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed., supra, if 990d (citing 2004 Policy Guide). A more recent U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice Policy Guide provides: \"The touchstone principle for the Division in\n\nanalyzing remedies is that a successful merger remedy must effectively preserve competition in\n\nthe relevant market.\" Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Division Policy Guide to\n\nMerger Remedies 1 (June 2011) [hereinafter 2011 Policy Guide] (footnote omitted).

That is, the\n       divestiture assets must be substantial enough to enable the purchaser to maintain\n       the premerger level of competition, and should be sufficiently comprehensive that\n       the purchaser will use them in the relevant market and be unlikely to liquidate or\n       redeploy them.\n\f 2004 Policy Guide at 9 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted); see also 2011 Policy Guide at 8.\n\n With these principles in mind, the court analyzes the effect of the proposed divestiture.\n\n                I.      Competitive Pressure Exerted by Post-Divestiture PFG\n\n        Defendants argue that the divestiture of 11 \"strategically located\" USF distribution centers\n\n to PFG, coupled with PFG' s \"aggressive\" expansion across the country, will \"replace [any]\n\n competitive intensity lost as a result of the merger.\" Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law, ECF No. 171 at 156 [hereinafter DFF] (alteration in original) (quoting 2004\n\nMerger Guidelines at 5). In addition to the 11 divested distribution centers, PFG's owner, The\n\nBlackstone Group, a leading private equity firm, has committed $490 million to develop seven\n\nmore distribution centers (called \"foldouts\") and to expand capacity in 16 existing facilities.\n\nHr'g Tr. 724, 767-69; DFF at 155. Defendants also point to the industry acumen and experience\n\nof PFG's executives, particularly that of its President and CEO, George Holm, who has over 37\n\nyears of experience in the foodservice distribution industry. The court does not doubt Blackstone's\n\nfinancial commitment to PFG or Mr. Holm's leadership capabilities. However, based on the\n\nevidence presented, the court is not persuaded that post-merger PFG will be able to step into USF' s\n\nshoes to maintain-certainly not in the near term-the pre-merger level of competition that\n\ncharacterizes the present marketplace.\n\n       PFG's five-year business plan shows that post-merger PFG will not be nearly as\n\ncompetitive as USF is today. In the lucrative market for national customers, the plan projects that\n\nPFG will have approximately    ti billion in national breadline sales by 20 l 9-less than half of\nUSF's 2013 national broadline sales o f . billion. PX09350-074; PX09060-002; PX09060-\n\n004; PX09060-006; PX09253-023. Stated in terms of market share, PFG estimates that it will\n\ngrow to 20 percent of the national breadline market over five years, with the merged Sysco-USP\n\n\n\n                                                102\n\f company having the \"remaining share of the national broadline business.\" PFF at 220; Hr'g Tr.\n\n 719, 721-22. That percentage is smaller than USF's share of the national broadline customer\n\n market today.    PX09350-187 (Dr. Israel's report stating \"the best case scenario under the\n\ndivestiture is the emergence of a significantly smaller competitor than USF even several years into\n\nthe future\"). Defendants are correct that the divestiture does not have to replicate pre-merger HHI\n\nlevels. However, the fact that PFGonly expects to achieve less than halfofUSF's current national\n\ncustomer sales in five years-assuming that its planned expansion efforts are successful-does\n\nnot demonstrate that PFG will be sufficiently able to \"discipline a merger-generated increase in\n\nmarket power.\" See 2011 Policy Guide at 8 (footnote omitted).\n\n        The court's concern about PFG's ability to compete effectively in the post-merger world\n\nis not limited to sales and market share projections. PFG's short-term effectiveness will depend\n\nin large part on its ability to incorporate the 11 formerly-USP-held distribution centers. Even\n\nassuming that PFG can do so seamlessly, the new PFG will have only 3 5 distribution centers-far\n\nfewer than the at least 100 distribution centers owned by the combined Sysco/USF. Having only\n\none-third of the merged company's distribution centers will put PFG at a significant disadvantage\n\nin competing for national customers. Indeed, as Dr. Israel demonstrated, Defendants' largest\n\nnational customers use more than 3 5 distribution centers. Those customers represent    I   percent\n\nof Sysco's national broadline revenues, and   I   percent of USF's national broadline revenues.\n\nPX09375-075-077, Figure 3. The court is not convinced that these large national customers will\n\nconsider a post-merger PFG to be as capable of meeting their needs as USF is today.\n\n       Defendants counter that \"PFG will be able to compete aggressively with its additional\n\ndistribution centers because the fewer the distribution centers used for a particular customer, the\n\ngreater the inbound efficiencies.\" DFF at 161-62. Because of higher volume per warehouse and\n\n\n\n                                               103\n\f lower freight costs, Defendants claim, many customers prefer to be served out of fewer distribution\n\n centers-so having a larger number of distribution centers is not necessarily a competitive\n\nadvantage. Id at 28, 161-62; Hr'g Tr. 1570-71, 1573-74; DX-00264at122-23. For example, to\n\nserve Zaxby's, a regional quick serve chain, PFGtrucks drive past some of their own distribution\n\ncenters because the longer drive \"proves cheaper for the customer.\" DFF at 161; Hr'g Tr. 852.\n\nPFG can also take advantage of\"shuttling,\" a technique of caravanning multiple trailers on a single\n\ntruck, to increase efficiencies. DFF at 162; Hr' g Tr. 855-57. Mr. Holm even stated at his\n\ndeposition that he believed that PFG would be able to s e r v e - out of 35 distribution centers\n\nmore effectively than USF currently does out    ofll DX-00276 at 96.\n        The court is skeptical of Defendants' claim that, even with far fewer distribution centers,\n\nPFG will be on equal competitive footing with the merged firm, especially for national customers.\n\nDefendants' own growth belies this fact. Both Sysco and USF have, over time, increased their\n\nnumber of distribution centers, demonstrating that Defendants view more distribution centers to\n\nbe a competitive advantage. Indeed, when Defendants presently compete for national business,\n\nthey highlight their nationwide geographic coverage to potential customers. See, e.g., PX03000-\n\n0l4 (USF presentation touting its \"[a]bility to leverage our national scale to cost effectively service\n\ncustomers nationally); PX00247-001-002 (USF email communication t o - describing\n\nthe \"US Foods Value Proposition\" as including a \"Privately held National Distribution footprint\n\ncompany\"); PX01062-005 (Sysco presentation to -                 highlighting that Sysco's \"national\n\nfootprint, strong service approach and our breadth of product offerings is what differentiates us\n\nfrom our competition\"); PX00279-001 (USF email t o - (a restaurant chain), mentioning\n\n\"national footprint and scale\" as a selling point); PX00281-006 (slide presentation t o .\n\n                        touting USF's \"extensive\" distribution network). USF's Executive Vice\n\n\n\n                                                 104\n\f President of Strategy David Schreibman also testified that USF has the ability to leverage its\n\n national scale to cost-effectively service customers, and that USF views its national scale as a\n\n significant competitive advantage.           Hr'g Tr. 1521-22; see also PX03010-001 (internal USF\n\n document stating that the \"[o ]nly 'true' options for both Premier and Novation is either Sysco or\n\n USF[;] [t]he regional players will bid, but not be seriously considered\"). Furthermore, there was\n\n no evidence presented that Defendants have moved to consolidate their distribution facilities to\n\n take advantage of the supposed benefits of having fewer distribution centers. 33\n\n         Notably, not even PFG has always considered the divestiture of only 11 distribution centers\n\n to be sufficient for it to compete on a national level. A PPG internal strategy document, dated\n\n April 3, 2014, sets forth two \"final\" proposals for additional distribution centers \"necessary to\n\n establish a national broadline network.\" One proposal included options of 16 to 20 distribution\n\n centers, and the other included a list of 14 to 15. Hr'g Tr. 669-71 (discussing PX09193). Six\n\nmonths later, in October 2014, after PFG had started negotiations with Sysco about the divestiture,\n\ninternal PFG communications re-affirmed the need for more than 11 distribution centers.\n\nFollowing Sysco's proposal to sell only seven distribution centers, a PFG board member wrote to\n\nGeorge Holm:\n\n         I would still find a way to tell the FTC that we think it takes 13 but that Sysco won't\n         let us look at more than 7 which will get us nowhere near a national solution. We\n         need the package size to be bigger to have any chance of winning and to ever\n         compete nationally. ... [We] should proactively educate the FTC why 13 opcos\n         [another word for distribution center] is the bare mimimum.\n\nPX09192-001 (emphasis added); see also PX00526-036; PX00526-141-142; PX09190. PFG did\n\njust that when it met with the FTC, making the case that it needed 13 distribution centers to\n\n\n\n33\n  Defense counsel at oral argument represented that USF recently had closed two distribution centers, Closing Arg.\nHr'g Tr. 113, but counsel for the FTC noted that USF also recently had opened a new distribution center, id. at 125-\n26.\n\n                                                       105\n\f\"compete effectively for national business.\" PX00526-039 at 153; PX09070 (PFG's presentation\n\nto the FTC with a map of 13 USF distribution centers needed by PFG, which included the four\n\nmetropolitan areas mentioned below). Ultimately, PFG was not able to negotiate the sale of more\n\nthan 11 distribution centers, with Sysco having made the decision that it \"would rather litigate\n\nw[ith] the FTC than sell more than 11.\" PFG felt that it was \"prudent to engage on 11 for now to\n\nkeep the momentum/dialogue going.\" PX09157-002; PX00526-041at163.\n\n        Having fewer distribution centers means that PFG will face coverage gaps m the\n\ngeographic areas where it sought, but did not receive, a distribution center. Those areas include:\n\nCincinnati, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Los Angeles, California,\n\nwhere PFG received a different, smaller distribution center than it requested. PX00526-039 at\n\n155-56; see also PX09070.\n\n        Defendants argue that PFG' s requests to Sysco for a larger number of distribution centers\n\nthan they actually received was part of a bargaining strategy. Closing Arg. Hr'g Tr. 115-16.\n\nHowever, PFG's recognition that it needed more than 11 distribution centers to compete nationally\n\nis reflected in internal documents that were created months before PFG began negotiating with\n\nSysco. The court credits those internal projections over PFG's current position that an additional\n\n11 distribution centers is enough to compete for national customers. See Amicus Br. of PFG, ECF\n\nNo. 133 at 22-24 (arguing that PFG will be able to compete effectively with 35 distribution\n\ncenters).\n\n       Defendants argue that, with the planned \"foldouts,\" i.e., new distribution facilities located\n\nin contiguous geographic markets, PFG will have more than the 13 distribution centers it was\n\nseeking, including one in Cincinnati. DX-01706 at 14. However, PFG has never done a foldout,\n\nand according to internal estimates, these facilities may not be operational until, at the earliest,\n\n\n\n                                                106\n\f several years following the merger. 34 Defendants assert that \"PFG will be well-positioned to bid\n\n on Day One,\" because even after the bids are submitted, discussions between a customer and a\n\n distributor can take up to a year before a contract is finalized, and PFG can continue its foldout\n\n efforts in the meantime. DFF at 160 (emphasis added). According to Defendants, if the customer\n\n needs service sooner, PFG can provide service via shuttling until the foldout is complete. Id at\n\n 161. However, there is substantial evidence showing that customers value having distribution\n\n centers close to their locations and that distribution costs increase with driving distance. Thus the\n\n court is not persuaded that-even with promises of foldouts and the use of shuttling-a sufficient\n\n number of national customers will view PFG as a viable alternative to the merged entity \"on day\n\none\" to maintain the intensity that characterizes the present competition between Sysco and USF.\n\n                   2.      Additional Disadvantages Faced by Post-Merger PFG\n\n         In addition to its lack of nationwide geographic coverage, the court has other concerns\n\nabout PFG's ability to compete against the merged entity. Because it will purchase in smaller\n\nproduct volumes than the merged Sysco entity, PFG could face higher product acquisition costs,\n\nor cost of goods sold (\"COGS\"), than its competitor. PX05051-003 (Blackstone Memorandum\n\nindicating that \"due to its scale, USF has better procurement than PFG and the 11 [distribution\n\ncenters] will likely spend more to acquire private label products and get less supplier rebate\n\ndollars\"); PX09350-205 (Dr. Israel's opinion that, even with the divestiture, PFG is unlikely to\n\nmake up the gap in COGS between itself and the parties today). PFG also will offer substantially\n\nfewer SKUs than the merged entity. PFG today sells less than half the total number of SKUs as\n\nUSF and one third the number of private label SKUs. PX06055-004 (USF offers 350,000 SKUs,\n\n\n\n34\n   PFG' s Senior VP of Operations estimated that PFG' s \"priority\" foldouts in Cincinnati, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan and\nBuffalo, New York, will not be operational until fiscal year 2018, and Montgomery, Alabama will not be operational\nuntil 2017. Hr'g Tr. 735-38.\n\n                                                        107\n\f of which 30,000 are private label); PX09507-007; PX09507-013 (PFG offers 150,000 SKUs, of\n\n which- are private label). PFG's fewer SKU offerings will be a competitive disadvantage.\n\n        PFG also will face disadvantages in terms of human resources. Defendants point out that,\n\nas part of the divestiture package, PFG would acquire over \"4, 400 USF personnel, including senior\n\nexecutives and personnel with healthcare expertise at the 11 distribution centers, and corporate\n\nregional leadership, national sales personnel, merchandising personnel, and others with national\n\nsales expertise; [and] a 12 month non-solicit of PFG employees at the 11 distribution centers.\"\n\nDFF at 155 (citing Hr'g Tr. 815-25; DX-06100 at 1). However, even assuming that every USF\n\nemployee at the 11 distribution centers becomes a PFG employee, PFG will still have fewer than\n\nhalf the sales representatives of either Sysco or USF today and less than one-quarter of the sales\n\nrepresentatives of the combined firm. PX09350-181-184, Figure 18. And, PFGwill only receive,\n\nat most, one-fifth of the national sales employees at USF dedicated to serving national customers.\n\nHr'g Tr. 1528-31 (stating that only about 20 percent ofUSF's national account team will be made\n\navailable for PFG to hire).\n\n       Moreover, PFG will be at a competitive disadvantage in its ability to offer value-added\n\nservices. The lucrative healthcare segment is illustrative. George Holm conceded that PFG has\n\nhad limited success with national healthcare customers. Hr' g Tr. 716-17. Some of that lack of\n\nsuccess is due to PFG's limited footprint, but it is also attributable to PFG's lack of expertise in\n\nthe healthcare segment and its inability to deliver value-added services to those customers. See,\n\ne.g., PX00594-025at100 (PFGhas a very small portion o~ members' business because\n\nPFG lacks acute care expertise); PX00474-001 (\"PFG offers a more limited selection of\n\nhealthcare-specific products than US Foods.\"). Even if over time PFG can acquire health care\n\nexpertise, in the short run it will be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to the merged\n\n\n\n                                                108\n\fentity. 35 For instance. Joan Ralph, Group Vice President of Premier testified that. even with the\n\nhealthcare employees PFG acquires through the divestiture. PFG will have significantly less\n\nhealthcare expe1tise than USF today. Hr'g Tr. 413: PX09350-21 l-212. And. as IFDA President\n\n1vfark Allen testified. Sysco and USF have the best understanding of the healthcare class of trade.\n\nDX-00294 at 121. The merger would only enhance that strategic advantage.\n\n               3.      Posf-1\\ferger PFG as an Independent Competitor\n\n        A final factor that cuts against the divestiture as a proposed fix is that PFG will be\n\ndependent on the merged entity for years following the transaction. \"In order to be accepted.\n\ncurative divestitures must be made to ... a \\villing, independent competitor capable of effective\n\nproduction .... \" CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2dat 59 (quoting Tfllite Consol. Indus. v. Ff'11irlpool\n\nCo11J., 781 F.2d 1224, 1228 (6th Cir. 1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the court\n\nobserved in CCC Holdings, it cau be a ''problem'' to allow \"continuing relationships between the\n\nseller and buyer of divested assets after divestiture. such as a supply ruTangement or technical\n\nassistance requirement which may increase the buyer's vulnerability to the seller's behavior.\" Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the Transition Services Agreement PFG will have\n\ncomplete access to USF private label products for three years at its I I new distribution centers.\n\nand therefore will be relying on the merged entity to license those products to PFG. See DX-06100\n\nat I; PX09060-005. PFG will also have the right to license USF's database for at least five years,\n\nwith a continuing option for five more. PFG, therefore, will noi be a truly independent competitor.\n\n\n\n\n                                               109\n\f        For the foregoing reasons, the court is not persuaded that the proposed divestiture will\n\n remedy the anticompetitive effects of the merger.\n\n        B.      Existing Competition\n\n                /.      Regionalization\n\n        Defendants assert that existing competition can and will constrain potential price increases\n\nor other unilateral effects in the national customer market. Their primary argument is that the ability\n\nof national customers to switch or threaten to switch to a network of regional distributors will inhibit\n\nanticompetitive behavior by the merged company. See Defs.' Opp 'n Br. at 40-41. Defendants point\n\nto many large national customers who multi-source their foodservice distribution needs, including\n\nusing various regional broadliners to service individual locations. Defendants cite as examples\n\nAmerinet, Sodexo, the Defense Logistics Agency,-, Subway, a n d - , all of whom\n\noperate regionally under multiple contracts. See id at 15.\n\n        But, for several reasons, the ability to regionalize is not likely to inoculate national\n\ncustomers from potential anticompetitive effects.       The decision of many large customers to\n\npredominantly use one breadline distributor is not simply a preference, as Defendants would\n\ncharacterize it, but a rational business decision. As already discussed, for the most part, the largest\n\nnational customers-particularly GPOs, foodservice management companies, and hospitality\n\ncompanies-predominantly rely on Sysco or USF for their breadline distribution needs. The largest\n\ncustomers, generally speaking, make from 61 percent to 100 percent of their breadline purchases\n\nfrom Sysco or USF. See FTC Closing Slide 35; PFF at 113-16. Even customers who contract\n\nregionally, such as -            and - ' buy in very high quantities from Defendants.\n\nRegionalization is available today, as it will be after the merger. But market actors are not moving\n\nto that model. To the contrary, as PFG's George Holm testified, the \"clear trend\" among large\n\n\n\n                                                 110\n\f customers is to move to a single nationwide provider. Hr'g Tr. 597-98. The court can only infer\n\n from this trend that regionalization is not a reasonable option for many national customers.\n\n        Regionalization likely has not taken hold for a variety of reasons. The record shows that\n\nwhen a customer increases its number of distributors, it incurs greater management and supply chain\n\ncosts, making it far less desirable to switch to a multi-regional model.       The court found the\n\ndeposition testimony of Dan Cox, the President and CEO of DMA, particularly illuminating, given\n\nthat the reason for DMA' s existence is to consolidate the product and service offerings of multiple\n\nregional distributors and compete for national customers. Mr. Cox testified that using a sole source\n\nbroadliner \"forms the most efficient supply chain.\" DX00265 at 44. He explained that \"[m]ore\n\nproducts at each delivery reduces our cost to service and therefore reduces their supply chain costs.\n\n     By aggregating [customers'] spend it makes the delivery system more efficient.\" Id. at 44-45.\n\n        A regional arrangement also brings with it the disadvantage of multiple points of contact.\n\nAs Mr. Cox testified, a single point of contact simplifies communications, which DMA touts as an\n\nadvantage over multi-sourcing broadline distribution. Id. at 14, 46, 68. He also added that a single\n\ninformation technology system is important to national customers, and DMA offers such a platform\n\nto attract them. As Mr. Cox explained: \"[I]f they come to DMA and deal with five different\n\nmembers, they wouldn't have to learn and understand five different order entry platforms. We have\n\njust one platform.\" Id at 68. A multi-regional approach thus likely would require a customer to\n\ndevelop greater information technology capabilities to manage its foodservice distribution\n\ncontracts.\n\n        Another downside of a multi-regional model is the difficulty in obtaining consistent\n\nproducts-particularly private label products-across a national customer's different locations.\n\nMr. Cox offered the example o f - , with which DMA does over -                  million in business.\n\n\n\n                                                111\n\f-         demands that DMA comply with its product specifications \"at a level of 90 percent,\" id\n\n at 74, indicating that even when a large customer uses multiple regional distributors, they impose\n\n rigorous demands with regard to product consistency. Product consistency, of course, can be\n\n achieved by purchasing from multiple distributors who carry the same brand-named products. But\n\nthat approach would limit a customer's ability to purchase private label products, which typically\n\noffer a better value proposition than branded products.\n\n        PFG's George Holm concurred with Dan Cox's assessment of national customers' business\n\nneeds and why they avoid regionalization. When asked why large national customers contract\n\nmainly with either Sysco or USF and why there is a clear trend toward those customers using a\n\nsingle broadliner, Holm offered numerous reasons: the \"ability to get SKUs in quickly\"; \"one place\n\nto contact\"; \"[o]ne IT system\"; \"[o]ne sales contract\"; \"[o]ne person to deal with\"; \"the same\n\nproduct [across] their system\"; writing \"one check as opposed to several\"; \"simplified contract\n\nadministration\"; and easier \"management of approved item lists and specifications.\" Hr' g Tr. 600-\n\n04. The court thus concludes that the possibility ofregionalizing broadline foodservice is not likely\n\nto protect national customers from the merger's anticompetitive effects.\n\n               2.      DMA\n\n       Today, the only other competitor with a nationwide footprint is DMA. Defendants claim\n\nthat DMA is capable of effectively competing against the merged entity because it provides a\n\nsingle point of contact, a single contract with consistent terms across customer locations, and a\n\nsingle ordering platform. DFF at 165-66 (citing DX-00265 at 63-64, 66, 68). The court disagrees.\n\n       Defendants acknowledge that DMA is not a one-stop-shop for national customers as Sysco\n\nand USF are today. Indeed, Defendants recognize that \"larger customers 'look to [DMA's]\n\n\n\n\n                                                112\n\fmembers regionally ... rather than D:NIA as a national solution.\"' Id. at 164-65 (quoting DX-\n\n00265 at 86).\n\n\n\n                                                      As Dan Cox, the President and CEO of DMA,\n\nexplained:\n\n\n\n\nDX-00265 at 64-65. As a result,\n\n                             Id. at 65.\n\n       National customers who value private label products, such as GPOs or foodservice\n\nmanagement companies,\n\n\n\n-·                       Id. at 79-80.\n\n                                    See id. at 224-26.\n\n      And, even if a national customer wanted to switch to DMA,\n\n                                          As   ~Jr.   Cox explained. '\n\n\n\n\n                          \" Id. at 99.\n\n\n\n\n                                                113\n\f                                                                                                Id. at\n\n 100, 157. For example,                    recently considered switching its business to DMA, but\n\ndecided to stay with Sysc                                                                . Id. at 227-\n\n29.\n\n                                                               , the court does not view DMA as a\n\nviable competitor that can constrain a post-merger Sysco.\n\n                3.     Conclusion as to Existing Competition\n\n        Based on the evidence presented, the court is convinced that national customers will be\n\nbetter off in a marketplace that has two strong competitors capable of nationwide broadline\n\ndistribution than in a marketplace in which there is a single undisputed heavyweight of broadline\n\ndistribution whose only competitive constraints is a transitioning PFG, DMA, and a collection of\n\nregional players.\n\n        C.     Entr-y of New Firms and Expansion of Existing Competitors\n\n        Defendants argue that the entry of new competitors and the expansion of existing\n\ncompetitors will keep the industry competitive. If a court finds that \"there exists ease of entry into\n\nthe relevant product market,\" that finding \"can be sufficient to offset the government's prima facie\n\ncase of anti-competitiveness.\" Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 55. \"The prospect of entry into\n\nthe relevant market will alleviate concerns about adverse competitive effects only if such entry\n\nwill deter or counteract any competitive effects of concern so the merger will not substantially\n\nharm customers.\" Merger Guidelines § 9. Ease of entry must be \"timely, likely, and sufficient in\n\nits magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract the competitive effects of concern.\" Id.\n\n(emphasis added).     As with their other rebuttal arguments, Defendants bear the burden of\n\ndemonstrating the ability of other distributors to \"fill the competitive void\" that will result from\n\n\n\n                                                114\n\f the proposed merger. See Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 169. Defendants assert that a lack\n\n of technological, legal, and regulatory barriers makes entry into the foodservice distribution\n\n industry relatively easy. Yet although all it may take is a \"guy and a truck\" to become a foodservice\n\n distributor, becoming a broadline foodservice distributor with the ability to compete for national\n\ncustomers is another thing altogether.\n\n        The broadline foodservice distribution industry is extraordinarily capital and labor\n\nintensive. It costs roughly $35 million to build a single distribution center. Hr' g Tr. 586. In\n\naddition, the distribution center must be stocked with goods. A fleet of expensive, refrigerated\n\ntrucks is required to deliver the products. People-lots of them-are needed to sell the broadline\n\nservice, maintain and stock the warehouse, and deliver the products. See Swedish Match, 131 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 171 (finding high barriers to entry where the evidence showed \"substantial sunk costs\n\nin plant construction, product development, and marketing\" required to compete). And, even if a\n\nnewcomer were to make the substantial investment to start a broadline distribution company, there\n\nis no guarantee that customers will follow. Incumbency is a powerful force in the foodservice\n\ndistribution industry.   See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 75 (finding that \"importance of\n\nreputation and brand in driving consumer behavior\" limited an existing competitor's ability to\n\nexpand). Even if it were possible for a new entrant to overcome the incumbent's advantage, it\n\nwould take years. These high barriers to entry will further entrench the merged company's market\n\npower. PX03003-005 (USF lender presentation describing broadline foodservice distribution as\n\nhaving \"High barriers to entry for scale players\").\n\n       Defendants also contend that existing firms have demonstrated the capacity to expand to\n\ncompete against the merged firm. They highlight the fact that other broadline distributors-\n\nincluding Shamrock, Ben E. Keith, and Reinhart-started out as small businesses serving only\n\n\n\n                                                115\n\f limited items to local customers, but were able to grow to regional prominence. They describe\n\n examples of competitors that have recently opened new facilities or plan to do so.\n\n        But none of these examples overcome the fundamental problem with expansion as a\n\n constraint on the merged company-like new entry, successful expansion is extraordinarily capital\n\nintensive and demands a long time horizon. Based on their assessment that expansion would not\n\nbe an economically viable strategy, regional distributors have said that they have no plans to\n\nexpand or reposition in order to serve national customers. - ' w h i c h has           I   distribution\n\ncenters mostly located in the                      , has told the FTC that such a massive expansion\n\nwould not be \"viable\" in the short term, given the \"time and cost required.\" P.xm-006. Other\n\nregional distributors, including\n\nhave similarly been dissuaded by the time, costs, or risks of expansion. P.xm-036 at 139-42;\n\nP.xm-004; P.xm-003; P.xm-005-006; P.xm-048-049.\n\n        Companies rarely enter new markets without an existing customer base because the costs\n\nand risks are prohibitive. There is a real \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with such expansion, known\n\nin the industry as \"greenfield\" expansion.       Companies will not make the significant capital\n\nexpenditure of building a new distribution center unless they already have customers to serve, but\n\ncustomers will not commit to a distributor unless it has demonstrated the ability to serve its needs.\n\nAs a result, expansion in the industry is typically done through \"foldouts\"-building distribution\n\ncenters in contiguous geographic areas-so that customers can be served from an existing facility\n\nuntil the new facility is built. But even foldouts take time to succeed. They can take from one to\n\nthree years to complete, and it can take four to five years for a foldout facility to achieve sales per\n\nsquare foot similar to established broadline facilities. PX00529-042 at 166-68; Hr'g Tr. 837-39;\n\nsee also PX00558-051 at 201-04. Although a foldout strategy may preserve competition in a\n\n\n\n                                                 116\n\f particular local market, it cannot effectively be used to replace the competition benefitting national\n\n customers lost by the merger. The only way in which a regional player could expand sufficiently\n\n and quickly enough to compete with the merged company would be through a sizeable acquisition\n\nof multiple distribution centers.\n\n        In summary, the court finds that, absent a substantial acquisition opportunity, expansion\n\nby regional players will not be timely, likely, and of sufficient magnitude to counteract\n\nanticompetitive harm.     See Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 58 (\"Although the smaller\n\nwholesalers may adequately compete and expand to service both the primary and secondary needs\n\nof local customers, this Court finds that they would not sufficiently expand to compete with the\n\nnationals.\").\n\n        D.      Efficiencies\n\n                I.     Requirement for Merger-Specific and Verifiable Efficiencies\n\n        Although the Supreme Court has never recognized the \"efficiencies\" defense in a Section 7\n\ncase, the Court of Appeals as well as the Horizontal Merger Guidelines recognize that, in some\n\ninstances, efficiencies resulting from the merger may be considered in rebutting the government's\n\nprimafacie case. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 720 (citations omitted). Where, as in this case, the court finds\n\nhigh market concentration levels, defendants must present \"proof of extraordinary efficiencies\" to\n\nrebut the government's prima facie case.        Id (citations omitted) (requiring \"extraordinary\"\n\nefficiencies to rebut an increase in HHI of 510 points); see also Areeda & Hovenkarnp 3d ed.,\n\nsupra, if 97lf (requiring \"extraordinary\" efficiencies where the \"HHI is well above 1800 and the\n\nHHI increase is well above 100\"). The court is not aware of any case, and Defendants have cited\n\nnone, where the merging parties have successfully rebutted the government's prima facie case on\n\nthe strength of the efficiencies. See CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 72 (stating that \"courts\n\n\n\n                                                 117\n\f have rarely, if ever, denied a preliminary injunction solely based on the likely efficiencies\"). Yet\n\n even if evidence of efficiencies alone is insufficient to rebut the government's primafacie case,\n\n such evidence may nevertheless be \"relevant to the competitive effects analysis of the market\n\n required to determine whether the proposed transaction will substantially lessen competition.\"\n\nArch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 151 (citations omitted).\n\n        The court must \"undertake a rigorous analysis of the kinds of efficiencies being urged by\n\nthe parties in order to ensure that those 'efficiencies' represent more than mere speculation and\n\npromises about post-merger behavior.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 721. Specifically, the court must\n\ndetermine whether the efficiencies are \"merger specific\"-meaning they represent \"a type of cost\n\nsaving that could not be achieved without the merger\"-and \"verifiable\"-meaning \"the estimate\n\nof the predicted saving must be reasonably verifiable by an independent party.\" H&R Block, 833\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 89 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Merger Guidelines § 1O); Cardinal\n\nHealth, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 62 (\"In light of the anti-competitive concerns that mergers raise,\n\nefficiencies, no matter how great, should not be considered if they could also be accomplished\n\nwithout a merger.\"). Defendants bear the burden of demonstrating that their claimed efficiencies\n\nare merger specific, H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 90, which requires demonstrating that the\n\nefficiencies \"cannot be achieved by either company alone,\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 722.             And,\n\nDefendants must also demonstrate that their claimed efficiencies would benefit customers. CCC\n\nHoldings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 74.\n\n       Defendants claim that the merger will generate over one billion dollars in annual cost\n\nsavings and operational synergies and, \"[e]ven when discounted substantially for unforeseen\n\nintegration complications, possible customer loss, and the divestiture, the merged company's\n\nefficiencies are expected to generate over $600 million in savings.\" DFF at 178. Defendants argue\n\n\n\n                                                118\n\f that the $600 million efficiencies estimate is \"the product of meticulous analysis and planning,\"\n\n which occurred over the course of eight months and involved over 100 employees at McKinsey,\n\nan independent consulting firm, and over 170 Sysco and USF employees who are extremely\n\nfamiliar with the business. Id. at 179. As Defendants explained, \"Sysco, USF, and McKinsey\n\nreviewed a back-breaking amount of information from the merging firms, analyzed historical\n\nintegration data, modeled possible cost-savings opportunities, and built a new organizational\n\nstructure around the companies' combined customer base, and designed detailed day 1, day 100,\n\nand year 1 plans for integration.\" Id. Of the $600 million cost savings identified by McKinsey,\n\nDefendants' expert Dr. Hausman identified more than $490 million as merger specific. To rebut\n\nDr. Hausman's opinion on efficiencies, the FTC presented Mr. Rajiv Gokhale of Compass\n\nLexecon as an expert in financial economics. He opined that at least 65 percent of Defendants'\n\nefficiencies were not merger specific. PX09351-007.\n\n       The court does not question the rigor and scale of the analysis conducted by McKinsey.\n\nNor does the court have any reason to question the accuracy of McKinsey' s total annual cost\n\nsavings estimate. But that is not the issue before the court. The issue is whether Defendants have\n\nshown that the projected \"merger-specific\" cost savings are substantial enough to overcome the\n\npresumption of harm arising from the increase in market concentration and other evidence of\n\nanticompetitive harm. As to that question, the court is unpersuaded that Defendants' combination\n\nwould result in $490 million in merger-specific cost savings. Defendants have not shown that that\n\namount, or at least a substantial portion of it, could not be achieved independently of the merger.\n\nNor does it appear that Dr. Hausman conducted any independent analysis of the McKinsey\n\nestimate to determine which savings, if any, can be achieved without the merger.\n\n\n\n\n                                               119\n\f        Sysco did not hire McK.insey to identify merger-specific savings for antitrust purposes.\n\nRather, it initially hired McK.insey in the fall of 2013 to determine whether a merged company\n\ncould achieve enough cost savings to make the combination worthwhile. Hr' g Tr. 1862-63. After\n\nMcKinsey concluded that the merger would generate sufficient cost savings and Sysco and USF\n\nannounced the merger, McK.insey began a more in-depth analysis beginning in January 2014 to\n\nidentify \"particular synergies that would arise from the deal.\" Id. at 1864-65. Carter Wood, the\n\nMcKinsey Director who led the effort, testified that his firm was hired \"to estimate what is possible\n\nby combining these two companies such that, number one, they would have confidence or not to\n\ngo ahead with the deal; and two, to create value for the newly integrated company.\" Id. at 1914.\n\nMcK.insey was not given instructions on identifying merger-specific savings, and Mr. Wood\n\ntestified that he was not familiar with the term \"merger specific.\" Id. at 1904.\n\n       Dr. Hausman used McK.insey's projections as his baseline for identifying merger-specific\n\nsavings. Id. at 2053. However, it is not clear what independent analysis Dr. Hausman did to\n\nreduce McK.insey's projected savings of $600 million annually to    sll million in merger-specific\nsavings. In his report, Dr. Hausman explained:\n\n       In my previous academic research I have emphasized the effect of cost saving\n       efficiencies on marginal cost, which can be approximated by average variable cost.\n       Thus I will take a conservative approach to the estimated efficiencies and focus on\n       cost savings from changes in variable costs that arise from the merger and would\n       not occur otherwise.\n\nDX-01355 at 67 (footnote omitted). It is not apparent, however, how Dr. Hausman calculated\n\nmerger-specific savings using this approach, as neither his testimony nor his report spell out\n\nprecisely how he went about identifying the amount of variable cost savings to include in his\n\nmerger-specific estimate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                120\n\f         Table 4a of Dr. Hausman's rebuttal rep01t illustrates the difficulties with verif}\"ing his\n\n analysis.

(iii) Sales, and (iv) Corporate. In each of those four\n\ncategories, Dr. Hausman listed the component pa1ts (in the first column) and the conesponding\n\namounts (in the fourth colmnn) that comprise the category cost savings estimate. Yet for each of\n\n                                                   121\n\f these elements, Dr. Hausman relied exclusively on documents created by either McKinsey or\n\n Defendants. See DX-01353 at Ex. C, 2 n.i. He performed no independent analysis to verify these\n\n numbers. Id. (\"All source material is either Sysco, US Foods, or McKinsey material and I take\n\n those materials at face value.\").\n\n        But even taking Dr. Hausman's variable cost savings numbers as presented, the court is\n\nnot convinced that the full $490 million in projected savings is merger specific. For example,\n\nnearly half of the -     million in merger-specific savings identified by Dr. Hausman come from\n\nthe \"Merchandising\" category, also known as \"category management.\" The $281 million that\n\nDr. Hausman attributed to category management cost savings comes directly from McKinsey' s\n\ncalculations. Category management refers to a process of optimizing a distributor's product\n\nassortment by gaining insights into which SKUs its customers value and then optimizing the SKU\n\ninventory to match customers' demands and procure those products in the most cost-efficient\n\nmanner. Hr'g. Tr. 1881. Both companies prior to the merger already were undertaking category\n\nmanagement efforts. PX00592-035 at 137-40; PX00592-049 at 193-94.\n\n        Although McKinsey Director Mr. Wood testified that McKinsey made an effort to identify\n\nonly incremental merchandising savings, that is, savings arising only because of the merger, he\n\ncould not say whether the $281 million included some cost savings that Defendants might have\n\nbeen able to achieve separately. For instance, before the merger, Sysco was undergoing a category\n\nmanagement program, called Project Naples, which was due to end in June 2015. However,\n\nProject Naples covered only two-thirds of Sysco's product categories; Sysco planned to complete\n\nthe remaining categories at a later date. Mr. Wood testified that the $281 million figure was in\n\naddition to the Project Naples costs savings, but he could not say whether or not that number was\n\n\n\n\n                                              122\n\f in addition to the cost savings that Sysco could achieve through its continued cost savings efforts\n\n beyond June 2015.\n\n        USF, meanwhile, suspended its category management project after the merger's\n\nannouncement.       At the time the merger was announced, USF had only conducted category\n\nmanagement    onl tol categories out of 300.      PX00592-035at139; PX00592-048-049at192-\n\n93. Mr. Wood could not say whether the $281 million was in addition to cost savings that USF\n\nmight have achieved had it continued its category management program. Thus, Dr. Hausman's\n\nestimate of $281 million in \"merger-specific\" savings in Merchandising-a number that, again,\n\nrelied exclusively on McKinsey's calculations-likely overstates the achievable merger-specific\n\ncategory management savings.\n\n        The FTC has pointed to, and Defendants have not rebutted, other ways in which\n\nDr. Hausman's reliance on McKinsey's estimates likely overstated the savings arising from the\n\nmerger. During the hearing, Mr. Wood acknowledged that part of the sales synergy estimate-\n\nwhich represents savings from combining the salesforces of the two companies-would be\n\nachieved by having customers place orders via an e-commerce platform. However, migration to\n\nelectronic ordering can be achieved by either company independently of the merger. Hr' g Tr.\n\n1904-05. Another savings strategy identified by McKinsey, \"maximizing backhaul,\" refers to\n\nhaving delivery trucks stop by suppliers to reload goods on their way back to the warehouse, in\n\norder to save an extra trip to those suppliers. Hr'g Tr. 1894-95. However, backhaul savings can\n\nalso be achieved independently of the merger. See Hr' g Tr. 1905-06.\n\n               2.      Insufficiency ofEstimated Merger-Specific Savings\n\n       Even if the court were to credit Dr. Hausman's total estimate of merger-specific\n\nefficiencies, the figure would only amount to less than one percent of the merged entity's annual\n\n\n\n                                               123\n\f revenue. PX09375-l 18 (Dr. Israel's rebuttal report stating that Dr. Hausman's original estimate\n\n of merger-specific, variable cost efficiencies of -      million per year represents only one percent\n\n of Sysco and USF's combined annual broadline revenue). 36 Even assuming that 100 percent of\n\n the cost savings would be passed on to customers, the savings are unlikely to outweigh the\n\n competitive harm to customers. Since the savings are equal to a small percentage of the combined\n\n company's total revenue, even a modest increase in price could offset any cost savings generated\n\n by the efficiencies. At oral argument, Defendants' response to this concern was that the market\n\n would not allow even a slight price increase, as customers would exercise their other options, such\n\n as regionalizing. See Closing Arg. Hr' g Tr. 117-18. Having found that this merger will result in\n\n high national customer and local market concentration levels, the court does not share Defendants'\n\n confidence that the market would not tolerate such a price increase. As the court observed in\n\n Cardinal Health, \"[t]he critical question raised by the efficiencies defense is whether the projected\n\nsavings from the merger[ ] are enough to overcome the evidence [showing] that possibly greater\n\nbenefits can be achieved by the public through existing, continued competition.\" 12 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 63. Here, Defendants have fallen short of making that showing.\n\n        E.      Conclusion\n\n        Upon consideration of all of the evidence presented, the court concludes that Defendants'\n\nrebuttal evidence is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of anticompetitive harm that the\n\nFTC was able to establish through evidence of high post-merger market concentrations and other\n\nevidence of competitive harm. The court thus concludes that the FTC has met its burden of\n\ndemonstrating a likelihood of success. That is, the FTC has raised \"questions going to the merits\n\nso serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful as to make them fair ground for thorough\n\n\n36\n  In 2013, Sysco and USF's combined broadline revenue wasiHJjiiJ.1•!=11PX09350-216, Table 27. One percent\nof that sum is greater than Dr. Hausman' s merger-specific cost savmgs estrrnate o f . million.\n\n                                                  124\n\f investigation, study, deliberation and determination by the FTC in the first instance and ultimately\n\n by the Court of Appeals.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 714-15 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n IV.     THE EQUITIES\n\n         Although the court has found that the FTC has shown a likelihood of success on the merits\n\nand thus created a presumption in favor of injunctive relief, see Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 172, Section 13(b)'s \"public interest\" standard still requires the court to weigh the public and\n\nprivate equities of enjoining the merge, Heinz, 246 F.3d. at 726. Here, the primary public interests\n\nto be considered include (i) the public interest in effectively enforcing antitrust laws and (ii) the\n\npublic interest in ensuring that the FTC has the ability to order effective relief if it succeeds at the\n\nmerits trial.\n\n        The public's interest in enforcing antitrust law plainly favors enjoining Defendants'\n\nproposed merger.      See id. (\"The principle public equity weighing in favor of issuance of\n\npreliminary injunctive relief is the public interest in effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.\");\n\nSwedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 173 (\"There is a strong public interest in effective enforcement\n\nof the antitrust laws that weighs heavily in favor of an injunction in this case.\").\n\n        The second public interest factor-preserving the FTC's ability to order effective relief\n\nafter the administrative hearing-also supports an injunction. As stated by the Court of Appeals,\n\n\"if the merger were ultimately found to violate the Clayton Act, it would be impossible to recreate\n\npre-merger competition\" because the merging parties would have already combined their\n\noperations and they would be difficult to separate, even by a subsequent divestiture order. Id.\n\n(\"Section 13(b) ... embodies Congressional recognition of the fact that divestiture is an inadequate\n\nand unsatisfactory remedy in a merger case.\"). That problem is amplified here because the\n\n\n\n                                                 125\n\f proposed merger involves two transactions, not just one: (i) Sysco's merger with USF and (ii)\n\nPFG's purchase ofUSF's distribution centers and other assets. The parties have represented that,\n\nabsent an injunction, Sysco and USF will merge their operations and divest 11 distribution centers\n\nand associated assets-including personnel, IT Systems, and USF private label products-to PFG,\n\nwhich will incorporate those assets into its own operations. As the FTC has pointed out, it would\n\nface an especially daunting and potentially impossible task of \"unscrambling\" the eggs (i.e.,\n\nreturning the merging companies to their pre-merger state) if the ensuing administrative\n\nproceedings were to determine that the merger violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Additionally,\n\nit is difficult to conceive how a subsequent divestiture order-which would attempt to restore the\n\nparties to their pre-merger state-could be fulfilled without causing significant disruption to the\n\nfoodservice distribution industry, its customers, and the ultimate consumers-Americans who eat\n\noutside the home.\n\n       Defendants contend that the public equities weigh against granting the preliminary\n\ninjunction because the merger will generate substantial efficiencies that will be passed on to\n\ncustomers. They claim that, ifthe FTC obtains the injunction, Defendants and their customers will\n\nbe harmed because \"Sysco and US Foods will abandon the merger and consumers will be deprived\n\nof its benefits.\" DFF at 186-87 (citing Hr' g Tr. 1516-17). But the court cannot conclude, on this\n\nrecord, that the merger's cost savings will outweigh the potential harm to customers from losing\n\nthe country's second largest broadline distributor as a competitor for their business. Dr. Israel's\n\nmerger simulation model predicted that, even taking into account the estimated cost savings, the\n\nmerger would harm customers. PX09350-l 14-121, Table 3. Although the court has reservations\n\nabout some of Dr. Israel's merger simulation model inputs, the court finds that the record as a\n\n\n\n\n                                               126\n\f whole-at the very least-raises substantial questions about whether the merger will harm\n\n consumers. Therefore, the public equities here favor granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n         The court recognizes the extraordinary amount of time, energy, and money that Sysco,\n\n USF, and PFG have devoted to the proposed merger. Their efforts, and the risk that the parties\n\n will abandon the merger rather than proceed to an administrative trial on the merits is, however,\n\n\"at best, a private equity\" which cannot overcome the significant public equities weighing in favor\n\nof a preliminary injunction. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        In the end, after considering the record in its entirety, the court returns to Judge Tatel's\n\nobservation in Whole Foods: \"[T]here can be little doubt that the acquisition of the second largest\n\nfirm in the market by the largest firm in the market will tend to harm competition in that market.\"\n\nWhole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1043 (Tatel, J.) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe court finds that the FTC has carried its burden of showing a \"reasonable probability\" that a\n\nmerger of the country's two largest broadline foodservice distributors, Sysco and USF, would harm\n\ncompetition. Defendants' merger is likely to cause unduly high market concentrations in two\n\nrelevant markets-broadline foodservice distribution to national customers and broadline\n\nfoodservice distribution to local customers-and eliminate a key competitor in those markets,\n\nUSF.   The evidence offered by Defendants to rebut the FTC's showing of likely harm was\n\nunavailing. The equities also favor granting the requested preliminary injunction. The FTC,\n\ntherefore, has established that it is likely to succeed in proving, after a full administrative hearing,\n\nthat the effect of Sysco' s proposed acquisition of USF \"may be substantially to lessen competition,\n\nor to tend to create a monopoly\" in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  127\n\f       The court thus grants the FTC's Motion for Preliminary Injunction.

The U.S. Department of\n\n    Commerce, for instance, recently reported, for the first time since it began tracking such data, that\n\n    Americans spent more money per month at restaurants and bars than in grocery stores. 1 Of course,\n\n    Americans eat out at many other places, too-sports arenas, school and workplace cafeterias,\n\n    hotels and resorts, hospitals, and nursing homes, just to name a few. The foodservice distribution\n\n    industry supplies food and related products to all of these locations. Foodservice distribution is\n\nbig business. In 2013, the market grew to $231 billion. By some estimates, there are over 16, 000\n\ncompanies that compete in the foodservice distribution marketplace.\n\n           The two largest foodservice distribution companies in the country are Defendants Sysco\n\nCorporation (\"Sysco\") and US Foods, Inc. (\"USF\"). Both are primarily \"broadline\" foodservice\n\ndistributors. As the name implies, a broadline foodservice distributor sells and delivers a \"broad\"\n\narray of food and related products to just about anywhere food is consumed outside the home.\n\nIn 2013, Sysco's broadline sales were over      sm billion and USF's were over sm billion.\n           In December 2013, Sysco and USF announced that they had entered into an agreement to\n\nmerge the companies. Fourteen months later, in February 2015, Sysco and USF announced that\n\nthey intended to divest 11 USF distribution facilities to the third largest broadline foodservice\n\ndistributor, Performance Food Group, Inc., if the merger received regulatory approval.\n\n           On February 20, 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and a group of states filed\n\nsuit in this court seeking an injunction to prevent the proposed merger. Specifically, under Section\n\n13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC asked this court to halt the proposed merger\n\n\n1\n  Michelle Jamrisko, Americans ' Spending on Dining Out Just Overtook Grocery Sales for the First Time Ever,\nBloomberg Business (Apr. 14, 2015), http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-14/americans-spending-on-\ndining-out-just-overtook-grocery-sales-for-the-first-time-ever.\n\n\n                                                     1\n\f until the FTC completes an administrative hearing-scheduled to begin on July 21, 2015-to\n\n determine whether the proposed combination would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n\n        The precise question presented by this case is whether the court should enjoin Sysco and\n\nUSF from merging until the proposed combination is reviewed by an FTC Administrative Law\n\nJudge. The real-world impact of the case, however, is more consequential. Sysco and USF have\n\nannounced that they will not proceed with the merger ifthe court grants the requested injunction.\n\n        The proceedings in this case have been extraordinary. The FTC investigated the proposed\n\nmerger for more than a year before filing suit. Then, within a two-month period, the parties worked\n\ntirelessly to exchange millions of documents, depose dozens of witnesses, and secure over a\n\nhundred declarations. The court heard live testimony for eight days in early May 2015. Counsel\n\nfor the parties have done all of this work while exhibiting the highest degree of skill and\n\nprofessionalism.\n\n        Congress passed the Clayton Act to enable the federal government to halt mergers in their\n\nincipiency that likely would result in high market concentrations.       Congress was especially\n\nconcerned with large combinations that would impact everyday consumers across the country.\n\nThe court has considered all of the evidence in this case and has reached the following conclusion:\n\nThe proposed merger of the country's first and second largest broadline foodservice distributors is\n\nlikely to cause the type of industry concentration that Congress sought to curb at the outset before\n\nit harmed competition. The court finds that the FTC has met its burden under Section l 3(b) of the\n\nFederal Trade Commission Act of showing that the requested injunction is in the public interest.\n\nThe court, therefore, grants the FTC's motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                                          BACKGROUND\n\n I.     THE FOODSERVICE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY\n\n        A.      Overview\n\n        Defendants operate in a $231 billion foodservice distribution industry, where over 16,000\n\n companies battle daily to sell food and related products to restaurants, resorts, hotels, hospitals,\n\n schools, company cafeterias, and so on-everywhere food is served outside the home.\n\nHr' g Tr. 1324; DX-00329 at 17. The types of customers served by the foodservice distribution\n\nindustry come in all shapes and sizes. They range from independent restaurants, to well-known\n\nquick-service and casual dining chains (e.g., Five Guys, Subway, and Applebee's), to hospitality\n\nprocurement companies and hotel chains (e.g., Avendra, Hilton Supply Management, and\n\nStarwood Hotels and Resorts), to government agencies (e.g., the U.S. Department of Veterans\n\nAffairs), to foodservice management companies (e.g., Aramark, Sodexo, and Compass Group), to\n\nhealthcare group purchasing organizations (e.g., Premier, Novation, and Navigator).\n\n        The industry recognizes four general categories of foodservice distribution companies:\n\n(i) broadline distributors, (ii) systems distributors, (iii) specialty distributors, and (iv) cash-and-\n\ncarry and club stores. Customers commonly purchase from foodservice distributors in one or more\n\nof these different categories, or \"channels,\" mixing and matching to suit their needs. For example,\n\ncustomers may purchase products directly from a broadline distributor; they may contract with a\n\nbrand-named food manufacturer (e.g., Tyson Foods for chicken or Kellogg's for cereal) and use a\n\nbroadline or systems distributor for warehousing and delivery; they may use specialty distributors\n\nfor select items such as produce or seafood; or they may make their purchases at a cash-and-carry\n\nor club store (e.g., Restaurant Depot or Costco).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f        Understanding these different channels of distribution and the different customers they\n\nserve is central to the antitrust analysis that this case demands. The court, therefore, describes\n\nbelow the sellers and buyers of foodservice distribution in the United States.\n\n        B.     Channels of Foodservice Distribution\n\n                1.     Broadbne Distributors\n\n        Broadline distribution is characterized by several key features, including: (i) product\n\nbreadth and depth; (ii) availability of private-label products; (iii) frequent and flexible delivery,\n\nincluding next-day service; and (iv) \"value-added\" services, such as menu and nutrition planning.\n\n        Broadline distributors offer thousands of distinct items for sale-known as \"stock keeping\n\nunits\" (\"SKUs\") for inventory management purposes-in a wide array of product categories,\n\nincluding canned and dry goods, dairy, meat, poultry, produce, seafood, frozen foods, beverages,\n\nand even janitorial supplies such as chemicals, cleaning equipment, and paper goods. Broadliners\n\nalso sell \"private label\" goods, which are akin to \"Trader Joe's\" or \"Safeway\" brand products\n\nfound in those grocery stores. \"Private label\" products are often comparable in quality to their\n\nname-brand counterparts, but are cheaper in price. Because they are able to offer such a diverse\n\narray of products, broadline distributors market themselves to customers as a \"one-stop shop,\" by\n\nvirtue of their ability to supply most-if not all-food and related products needed by their\n\ncustomers. Customers value the breadth of product offerings and the opportunity to aggregate a\n\nsubstantial portion of their purchases with one distributor, allowing them to save costs. They also\n\nappreciate broadliners' high level of customer service, which usually includes next-day and\n\nemergency deliveries. Focusing heavily on individualized customer service, broadline distributors\n\nemploy much larger salesforces than the other channels.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f        Broadline distributors come in different sizes. The largest, by any measure, are Sysco and\n\n USF. In 2013, Sysco and USF made. billion a n d . billion in broadline sales, respectively.\n\n PX09350-236, Table 44. The next largest broadliner made less than $6 billion. Id Sysco and\n\nUSF are also the only two broadliners with true nationwide service capability. Sysco and USF\n\nhave 72 and 61 distribution centers, respectively-each with more than twice the number of\n\ndistribution centers operated by the next-largest broadliners.       Because of their nationwide\n\nfootprint, Sysco and USF are often referred to as \"national\" broadliners. Combined, Defendants\n\nemploy over 14,000 sales representatives.       No other broadliner employs more than 1,600.\n\nDefendants together operate over 13,000 trucks. The next largest broadliners have just over 1,600.\n\n        The next tier of companies are \"regional broadliners,\" so called because their distribution\n\ncapabilities are concentrated in discrete regions of the United States.       The largest regional\n\nbroadliner, Performance Food Group (\"PFG\"), is the country's third-largest broadliner in terms of\n\nsales. PFG operates 24 broadline distribution facilities, mainly in the eastern and southern parts\n\nof the country and, in 2013, earned $6 billion in broadline revenue. The next five largest regional\n\nbroadline distributors, in order of 2013 revenues, are:     (i) Gordon Food Service, which has\n\nI 0 distribution centers mainly in the Midwest, Florida, and Texas; (ii) Reinhart Foodservice, which\n\nhas 24 distribution centers, primarily in the East and Midwest; (iii) Ben E. Keith Company, which\n\nhas seven distribution centers in Texas and bordering states; (iv) Food Services of America, which\n\nhas I 0 distribution centers, concentrated in the Northwest; and (v) Shamrock Foods, which has\n\nfour distribution centers in the Southwest and southern California. These regional broadliners had\n\n2013 revenues ranging from approximately    4111 billion to 4111 billion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The last tier of broadliners have five or fewer distribution centers and 2013 revenues of\n\n less than $1.1 billion.   Many of these operate in a single locality or region, like Shetakis\n\n Wholesalers, which has one distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n        Regional broadline distributors have formed consortiums to compete for customers with\n\n multi-regional distribution needs.   The largest consortium is Distribution Market Advantage\n\n (\"DMA\"). DMA is a supply chain sales and marketing cooperative owned by nine independent\n\nregional distributors, which are also its members, including Gordon Food Service, Ben E. Keith,\n\nand Reinhart Foodservice. DMA does not own any trucks or distribution facilities; rather, its\n\npurpose is to coordinate the bidding, contracting, and operational processes of its members to meet\n\nthe needs of large customers that require a distributor with extensive geographic coverage.\n\nAnother consortium is Multi-Unit Group (\"MUG''), an alliance of 19 broadline distributors who\n\nare part of UniPro Foodservice, a larger consortium that includes distributors in different channels.\n\nAs explained later, these regional consortia have had mixed results in competing for large,\n\ngeographically dispersed customers.\n\n               2.      Systems Distributors\n\n        Systems distributors, also referred to as \"custom\" or \"customized\" distributors, primarily\n\nserve fast food, quick service, fast casual, and casual chain restaurants (e.g., Burger King,\n\nWendy's, and Applebee's), which have fixed or limited menus. Unlike broadliners, systems\n\ndistributors do not carry a large, diverse number of SKUs. Rather, their inventory profile is a small\n\nnumber of proprietary SKUs, which are manufactured specifically for the customer. For instance,\n\nthe systems distributor for Wendy's carries and delivers the food products needed for Wendy's'\n\nmenu and does not make those products available to others. As a result, systems distributors\n\ntypically provide only warehousing and transport services. They do not offer private label products\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f or value-added services such as menu planning, and they have very small salesforces, if any.\n\n Systems distributors make large, limited-SKU deliveries on a fixed, limited schedule, and typically\n\n do not offer next-day or emergency deliveries.\n\n         Some foodservice distribution companies operate both systems and broadline divisions.\n\nFor instance, Sysco operates SYGMA, a systems distribution division. SYGMA is run by a\n\n different set of executives and, for the most part, operated out of separate distribution centers. PFG\n\noffers systems distribution through PFG Customized, which is run separately from its broadline\n\ndivision.\n\n                3.      Specialty Distributors\n\n        Specialty distributors offer a limited and focused grouping of products within one or more\n\nproduct categories-typically fresh produce, meat, seafood, dairy or baked goods. Other specialty\n\ndistributors focus on a specific type of cuisine, such as Italian fare. Many customers, especially\n\nindependent restaurants, use specialty distributors to supplement their purchases from broadline\n\ndistributors because the specialty distributor offers higher quality or fresher products than the\n\nbroadline distributor or provides unique products that the broadline distributor does not carry, such\n\nas products from local farmers. Both in terms of number of SKUs and geographic coverage,\n\nspecialty distributors are typically smaller than broadline distributors.\n\n        To compete with specialty distributors, some broadliners operate specialty divisions.\n\nSysco, for instance, operates several specialty divisions separately from its broadline division. So,\n\ntoo, does PFG, which operates Roma, a specialty division for Italian food products.\n\n               4.      Cash-and-Carry and Club Stores\n\n       Cash-and-carry stores offer a \"self-service\" model of food distribution, in which customers\n\nmake purchases at the store and transport the purchased goods themselves. Club stores like Costco\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f and Sam's Club also fall within this distribution channel. With limited exceptions, cash-and-carry\n\n stores do not deliver. They also offer fewer products than broadline distributors. For example,\n\nthe largest cash-and-carry store, Restaurant Depot, only carries up t o . SKUs. Additionally,\n\n cash-and-carry stores do not have sales personnel dedicated to individual customers. Because of\n\nthese features, the prices offered by cash-and-carry stores are significantly lower than those offered\n\nby broadliners. The typical cash-and-carry customer is an independent restaurant that either does\n\nnot meet broadline distributors' minimum purchase requirements or needs to supplement its\n\nbroadline deliveries.\n\n        C.      Foodsenrice Distribution Customers\n\n        Foodservice distribution customers are a heterogeneous group. The largest customers, such\n\nas group purchasing organizations and foodservice management companies, buy hundreds of\n\nmillions of dollars of product a year, whereas a single independent restaurant buys a small fraction\n\nof that amount. Some customers choose to buy from a single line of distribution; others mix\n\ndistribution channels. Some customers demand fixed pricing, whereas others buy based on daily\n\nmarket rates. Generally speaking, however, customers can be grouped into several categories.\n\n                /,      Group Purchasing Organizations\n\n        Group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, are entities that, through the collective buying\n\npower of their members, obtain lower prices for foodservice products. GPOs negotiate direct\n\ncontracts with food manufacturers and thereby secure lower prices than a member could\n\nindividually.\n\n       GPOs do not have their own distribution capabilities. Rather, they contract with broadline\n\ndistributors for warehousing, delivery, and operational services. When a member purchases a\n\nGPO-contracted good, the member pays the broadliner on a \"cost-plus\" basis: it pays for the \"cost\"\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f of the product based on the GPO' s contract with the manufacturer, \"plus\" the distributor's markup,\n\n which is negotiated between the GPO and distributor. GPOs also contract with broadliners to\n\n allow their members to purchase products from breadline distributors (rather than from\n\n manufacturers), in which case they pay the breadline distributor both the distribution margin\n\n (markup) and the cost for the product set by the distributor. GPO members also buy from specialty\n\n distributors.\n\n         GPOs are prominent in the healthcare and hospitality industries. The largest healthcare\n\nGPOs include Premier, Novation, and Navigator. One of the largest hospitality GPOs is Avendra.\n\nThese companies annually spend hundreds of millions of dollars on breadline distribution.\n\n                 2.    Foodservice Management Companies\n\n         Foodservice management companies operate cafeterias or other dining facilities at\n\neducational institutions, sports venues, and workplaces. Like GPOs, foodservice management\n\ncompanies negotiate contracts with food manufacturers and rely on broadliners for storage and\n\ndelivery; they also purchase directly from broadliners and specialty distributors. Sodexo, Compass\n\nGroup, and Aramark are among the country's largest foodservice management companies. Those\n\nthree companies each spend approximately    ti billion annually on breadline distribution.\n                 3.   Hospitality Chains\n\n        Hospitality chains are also large purchasers. Hilton Hotels, for example, uses a system\n\nsimilar to a GPO. It has a subsidiary, Hilton Supply Management LLC, which negotiates contracts\n\non behalf of over 4,000 members to obtain food and related items at a discounted price. Other\n\nhospitality companies, such as Hyatt Hotels, purchase most of their foodservice products through\n\nAvendra, the largest hospitality GPO. Starwood Hotels and Interstate Hotels & Resorts, on the\n\nother hand, directly manage food procurement and distribution contracts for their properties.\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f Regardless of the food purchasing model, hospitality chains also buy food directly from\n\n broadliners and rely on them for their storage and delivery needs.       These companies spend\n\n hundreds of millions of dollars annually on broadline distribution. Individual hotels and resorts\n\n also buy directly from specialty distributors, as needed.\n\n                4.      Restaurant Chains\n\n        Restaurant chains come in many sizes with a wide variety of characteristics. This customer\n\ncategory includes nationwide fast food or quick service restaurants such as Burger King and\n\nSubway, each with thousands of locations in all regions of the country. It also includes regional\n\nfast casual restaurant chains such as Culver's (primarily in the Midwest) and Zaxby's (primarily\n\nin the Southeast), as well as nationwide sit-down restaurant chains, such as Applebee's and\n\nCheesecake Factory. The channel of distribution a chain restaurant uses depends, in part, on the\n\nnumber of locations and menu variety. The greater the number of locations and the fewer the\n\nmenu items, the more amenable the chain restaurant is to systems distribution.\n\n                5.     Government Agencies\n\n        Some government agencies, notably the Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, are large buyers of broadline distribution services.        Those\n\nagencies, for instance, spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on broadline foodservice.\n\n               6.      \"Street\" Customers\n\n       Customers with only one location, or a handful of locations, are referred to in the industry\n\nas \"street,\" \"local,\" or \"independent\" customers. Examples of this type of customer include\n\nindependent restaurants and resorts.     Unlike the types of customers identified above, street\n\ncustomers usually do not have written contracts with broadliners; instead, they negotiate prices on\n\na weekly or other short term basis. They also tend to diversify their purchases among multiple\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f distribution channels. Indeed, according to a study conducted by an industry trade group, the\n\n International Foodservice Distributors Association, the typical independent customer uses up to\n\n twelve different supply sources.

As the\n\nlargest North American foodservice distributor, Sysco distributes food to approximately 425,000\n\ncustomers in the United States, generating sales of about $46. 5 billion in fiscal year 2014. CompI.\n\nfor TRO and Prelim. lnj. Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, ECF No. 3 at if 24 [hereinafter\n\nCompl.]. Sysco's business is divided into three divisions: (i) Broadline (81 percent of revenue);\n\n(ii) SYGMA, which provides systems distribution (13 percent ofrevenue); and (iii) \"Other,\" which\n\nprovides, among other things, specialty produce distribution (6 percent of revenue). Id.        if   25.\n\nSysco's broadline division operates out of 72 distribution centers located across the United States.\n\nId\n\n       Defendant US Foods, Inc., is a privately-held corporation based in Rosemont, Illinois, and\n\nis a wholly owned subsidiary of Defendant USF Holding Corp.                 USF is controlled by the\n\ninvestment funds of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc., and KKR & Co., L.P. The second-largest\n\nfoodservice distributor in the United States, USF operates 61 broadline distribution centers across\n\nthe country and serves over 200,000 customers nationwide. Id.      if 27.    In fiscal year 2013, USF\n\ngenerated approximately $22 billion in revenue. Id\n\n       B.      History of the Merger\n\n       On December 8, 2013, Sysco and USF signed a definitive merger agreement, whereby\n\nSysco agreed to acquire all shares ofUSF for $500 million in cash and $3 billion in newly issued\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f Sysco equity.    Sysco also agreed to assume $4.7 billion in USF's existing debt, for a total\n\ntransaction value of $8.2 billion. The merger agreement expires on September 8, 2015.\n\n         After announcing the merger, Defendants filed a notification regarding the merger as\n\nrequired by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a. As a result of\n\nthis filing, the FTC commenced an investigation to determine the effects of the proposed\n\ncombination. The FTC is an administrative agency of the United States federal government that\n\nderives its authority from the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 41 et seq.\n\nAmong other duties, the FTC is vested with authority and responsibility for enforcing Section 7 of\n\nthe Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45.\n\n        During the FTC's investigation, and with the hope of gaining regulatory approval, on\n\nFebruary 2, 2015, Sysco and USF announced an asset purchase agreement with regional broadline\n\ndistributor Performance Food Group, Inc. (\"PFG\"), to sell 11 of USF's 61 distribution centers to\n\nPFG, contingent upon the successful completion of the merger. The 11 USF distribution centers-\n\nintended to increase PFG' s geographic footprint-are, for the most part, located within the western\n\nhalf of the country, where PFG at present has only one distribution center.         Currently, the\n\n11 distribution centers account for approximately $4.5 billion in broadline sales. PX09250-0l l.\n\nThe parties also executed a Transition Services Agreement. Under the two agreements, PFG\n\nwould acquire all assets and employees at the 11 distribution centers, all customers under those\n\ncontracts (assuming the customers consent), and the right to use USF private label products at\n\nthose facilities for up to three years.\n\n        C.       History of these Proceedings\n\n        On February 19, 2015, the Commissioners of the FTC voted 3-2 to authorize the filing of\n\nan administrative complaint in the FTC's Article I court to block the proposed merger, based on a\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f finding that there was reason to believe that the merger would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act,\n\n 15 U.S.C. § 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45. Trial before an Administrative Law\n\nJudge is scheduled to begin on July 21, 2015.\n\n        Also, on February 19, 2015, the Commission authorized the FTC staff to seek a preliminary\n\ninjunction in federal court under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act in order to prevent Defendants from\n\ncompleting the merger. The FTC filed this action on February 20, 2015, seeking a temporary\n\nrestraining order (\"TRO\") and preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo until the\n\nconclusion of the administrative trial. The FTC is joined in this action by the District of Columbia\n\nand the following states:     California, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, North\n\nCarolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (collectively, the \"Plaintiff States\"). By\n\nand through their respective Attorneys General, the Plaintiff States have joined with the FTC in\n\nthis action pursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, in their sovereign or quasi-\n\nsovereign capacities as parens patriae on behalf of the citizens, general welfare, and economy of\n\neach of their states.\n\n        On February 24, 2015, Defendants stipulated to a TRO, agreeing not to merge until three\n\ncalendar days after this court rules on the FTC's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The court\n\nentered the stipulated TRO on February 27, 2015. Defendants have since represented that they\n\nwill abandon the transaction if this court grants the preliminary injunction.\n\n        On March 4, 2015, the court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing to start on May 5,\n\n2015. The parties' counsel accomplished an extraordinary amount of work in the two months\n\nleading up to the evidentiary hearing. They exchanged approximately 14.8 million documents and\n\ntook 72 depositions. Moreover, in addition to the more than 90 industry participant declarations\n\nthat accompanied the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction, Defendants obtained 65 new\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f declarations or counter declarations, while the FTC obtained an additional 25 new or counter\n\n declarations.   During the eight-day evidentiary hearing, the court heard testimony from 20\n\n witnesses, either live or via video deposition. The parties submitted a total of 185 declarations\n\n into evidence, as well as over 3,500 exhibits and excerpts of over 70 depositions. The court heard\n\nclosing arguments on May 28, 2015.\n\n                                       LEGAL STANDARD\n\nI.      SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ACT\n\n        Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions \"the effect of [which] may\n\nbe substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" in \"any line of commerce\n\nor in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country.\" 15 U.S.C. § 18.

As the Court of Appeals explained in Heinz: \"Congress\n\nintended this standard to depart from what it regarded as the then-traditional equity standard, which\n\nit characterized as requiring the plaintiff to show: (1) irreparable damage, (2) probability of\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f success on the merits and (3) a balance of equities favoring the plaintiff.\" 246 F.3d at 714 (internal\n\n citation omitted).

According to the\n\nFTC, the relevant product market is broadline foodservice distribution. Compl.       ~   40. Because\n\nbroadline distribution is defined by a number of distinct attributes-such as a vast array of product\n\nofferings, private label offerings, next-day delivery, and value-added services-the FTC contends\n\nthat the other modes of distribution are not reasonable substitutes for broadline distribution and\n\nthus must be excluded from the product market.\n\n       The FTC further contends that, within the product market for broadline distribution, there\n\nis another product market for foodservice distribution sold to \"national\" customers. Id   ~ 44.   These\n\ncustomers, the FTC asserts, are distinct from \"local\" or \"street\" customers in multiple respects.\n\nNational customers have a nationwide or multi-regional footprint and, because of that footprint,\n\ntypically contract with a broadliner that has geographically dispersed distribution centers; they\n\nusually make purchases under a single contract that offers price, product, and service consistency\n\nacross all facilities; and they award contracts through a request for proposal or bilateral\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f negotiations.        National customers include, among others, GPOs, foodservice management\n\n companies, hospitality chains, and national chain restaurants. By contrast, the FTC says, the\n\n typical \"local\" or \"street\" customer is an independent restaurant, which does not require multiple,\n\n geographically dispersed distribution centers; purchases in smaller quantities; and ordinarily does\n\n not have a contract with its foodservice distributor(s) as it negotiates purchases on a weekly or\n\n other short-term basis.     The FTC contends that for national customers the geographic market is\n\nnationwide. For local customers, it argues that the geographic market is localized near Defendants'\n\ndistribution centers.\n\n        Defendants counter that the foodservice distribution market cannot be sliced and diced as\n\nadvocated by the FTC. According to Defendants, the relevant market is the entire $231 billion\n\nfoodservice distribution industry, consisting not only of broadline food distributors, but also\n\nspecialty distributors, systems distributors, and cash-and-carry stores. All of these modes of\n\ndistribution, Defendants argue, compete for foodservice distribution customer spending. Based on\n\nthis market definition, Defendants assert that together, they make up approximately 25 percent of\n\ntotal foodservice distribution sales. They also dispute that there is a product market for \"national\n\ncustomers,\" asserting that such a market has been created by the FTC out of whole cloth to\n\nartificially inflate Defendants' market shares. According to the FTC, Defendants combined have,\n\nat least, a 59 percent share of the national customer product market.\n\n       A.

Legal Principles Affecting the Definition of the Relevant Product Market\n\n       The Supreme Court in Brown Shoe set forth the general rule for defining a product market:\n\n\"The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of\n\nuse or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.\" Brown\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. Stated another way, a product market includes all goods that are reasonable\n\n substitutes, even though the products themselves are not entirely the same. Cardinal Health,\n\n 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46; Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. at 1074 (stating the question as \"whether two\n\n products can be used for the same purpose, and if so, whether and to what extent purchasers are\n\n willing to substitute one for the other\").\n\n        Whether goods are \"reasonable substitutes\" depends on two factors:                functional\n\ninterchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand.       \"Functional interchangeability\" refers to\n\nwhether buyers view similar products as substitutes. See id (\"Whether there are other products\n\navailable to consumers which are similar in character or use to the products in question may be\n\ntermed 'functional interchangeability.'\"). \"If consumers can substitute the use of one for the other,\n\nthen the products in question will be deemed 'functionally interchangeable.'\" Arch Coal, 329\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 119; see also United States v. E.l du Pont de Nemours & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105408\"><a href=\"/opinion/105408/united-states-v-ei-du-pont-de-nemours-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393\n\n(1956)) (\"Determination of the competitive market for commodities depends on how different\n\nfrom one another are the offered commodities in character or use, how far buyers will go to\n\nsubstitute one commodity for another.\").           \"Courts will generally include functionally\n\ninterchangeable products in the same product market unless factors other than use indicate that\n\nthey are not actually part of the same market.\" Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 119.\n\n        As for cross-elasticity of demand, there the question turns in part on price. E.l Du Pont\n\nDe Nemours, 351 U.S. at 400 (\"An element for consideration as to cross-elasticity of demand\n\nbetween products is the responsiveness of the sales of one product to price changes of the other.\").\n\nIf an increase in the price for product A causes a substantial number of customers to switch to\n\nproduct B, the products compete in the same market. See id (\"If a slight decrease in the price of\n\ncellophane causes a considerable number of customers of other flexible wrappings to switch to\n\n\n                                                20\n\f cellophane, it would be an indication ... that the products compete in the same market.\"); Arch\n\n Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 120. Price is not, however, the only variable in determining the cross-\n\n elasticity of demand between products. Cross-elasticity of demand also depends on the \"ease and\n\n speed with which customers can substitute [the product] and the desirability of doing so.\" FTC v.\n\n Whole Foods Market, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287444\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287444/ftc-v-whole-foods-market-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Brown, J.). Thus, substitution\n\nbased on a reduction in price will not correlate to a high cross-elasticity of demand unless the\n\nswitch can be accomplished without the consumer incurring undue expense or inconvenience.\n\nSee Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 358 (observing that \"[t]he factor of inconvenience localizes\n\nbanking competition as effectively as high transportation costs in other industries\").\n\n        Three other established principles are critical to defining the relevant product market in\n\nthis case. The first is that the \"product\" that comprises the market need not be a discrete good for\n\nsale. As the Supreme Court has made clear: \"We see no barrier to combining in a single market\n\na number of different products or services where that combination reflects commercial realities.\"\n\nUnited States v. Grinnell Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107254\"><a href=\"/opinion/107254/united-states-v-grinnell-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (1966); Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 356\n\n(citation omitted) (finding that \"the cluster of products ... and services ... denoted by the term\n\n'commercial banking' ... composes a distinct line of commerce\"). Thus, what is relevant for\n\nconsideration here is not any particular food item sold or delivered by Defendants, but the full\n\npanoply of products and services offered by them that customers recognize as \"breadline\n\ndistribution.\"\n\n       Second, \"the mere fact that a firm may be termed a competitor in the overall marketplace\n\ndoes not necessarily require that it be included in the relevant product market for antitrust\n\npurposes.\" Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1075; Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 47 (same). That is\n\nbecause market definition hinges on whether consumers view the products as \"reasonable\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\f substitutes.\" Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46. So, for example, fruit can be bought from\n\n both a grocery store and a fruit stand, but no one would reasonably assert that buying all of one's\n\n groceries from a fruit stand is a reasonable substitute for buying from a grocery store. See Whole\n\nFoods, 548 F.3d at 1040 (Brown, J.) (\"The fact that a customer might buy a stick of gum at a\n\n supermarket or at a convenience store does not mean there is no definable groceries market.\").\n\nThus, as applicable here, the fact that buyers may cross-shop between modes of food distribution\n\ndoes not necessarily make them part of the same market for the purpose of merger analysis.\n\n         Third, market definition is guided by the \"narrowest market\" principle. Arch Coal, 329\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 120. That is, \"a relevant market cannot meaningfully encompass [an] infinite range\n\n[of products]. The circle must be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within\n\nreasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will tum.\" Times-Picayune Puhl g\n\nCo. v.

Judge Bates inArch Coal succinctly described\n\nthe \"narrowest market\" principle in practice as follows:\n\n        The analysis begins by examining the most narrowly-defined product or group of\n        products sold by the merging firms to ascertain ifthe evidence and data support the\n        conclusion that this product or group of products constitutes a relevant market. If\n        not, the analysis shifts to the next broadest product grouping to test whether that is\n        a relevant market. This process continues until a relevant market is identified.\n\nArch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 120; see also United States v.

The Brown Shoe \"Practical Indicia\"\n\n            Courts look to two main types of evidence in defining the relevant product market: the\n\n    \"practical indicia\" set forth by the Supreme Court in Brown Shoe and testimony from experts in\n\n    the field of economics. The court turns first to the Brown Shoe factors.\n\n            According to Brown Shoe, \"[t]he boundaries of [a product market] may be determined by\n\n    examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition ... , the product's peculiar\n\n    characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity\n\n    to price changes, and specialized vendors.\" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. \"These indicia seem to\n\n    be evidentiary proxies for direct proof of substitutability.\" Rothery Storage & Van Co. v.

Cir. 1986); H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 51. Courts\n\n    have relied on the Brown Shoe factors in a number of cases to define the relevant product market. 2\n\nSee, e.g., Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1075-80; Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46-48; Swedish\n\nMatch, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 159-64; CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 39-44; H&R Block,\n\n833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-60.\n\n           The court finds that the Brown Shoe factors support the FTC's position that broadline\n\nfoodservice distribution is the relevant product market for evaluating the proposed merger.\n\nAs discussed below, an analysis of those factors demonstrates that other modes of foodservice\n\ndistribution are not functionally interchangeable with broadline foodservice distribution.\n\n                           a.       Product breadth and diversity\n\n           The most distinguishing feature of broadline distribution is its product breadth and\n\ndiversity. Broadliners stock thousands of SKUs across every major food and food-related category\n\n\n\n2\n The Brown Shoe practical indicia may indeed be \"old school,\" as Sysco's counsel asserted at oral argument, Closing\nArg. Hr'g Tr. 44, and its analytical framework relegated \"to the jurisprudential sidelines,\" see Whole Foods, 548 F.3d\nat 1059 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). But Brown Shoe remains the law, and this court cannot ignore its dictates.\n\n                                                         23\n\f in their distribution centers. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1078 (comparing SKU selections among\n\n different sales outlets). The average Sysco or USF distribution center carries o v e r - SKUs.\n\n Regional broadliners cany fewer SKUs than Defendants, but still maintain between 6,000 to\n\n 19,000 SKUs in their distribution centers. PX09350-215, Table 22. Broadliners also offer \"private\n\nlabel\" products, which are a broadliner's branded products. Sysco has o v e r - private-label\n\nSKUs, and USF has over • . PX09350-219, Table 32. This product breadth and diversity\n\nenables broadliners to serve a wide variety of customers and to be a one-stop shop, if the customer\n\nwishes. As USF's Executive Vice President of Strategy David Schreibman testified at the FTC's\n\nInvestigational Hearing: \"[W]e have such a broad selection of SKUs because that is a key\n\nconsideration of our customer base, you have to have what they want.\" Investig'I Hr'g Tr.,\n\nPX00590-006 at 24.\n\n        The other distribution channels pale in comparison to broadline in terms of product breadth\n\nand diversity.   Systems distributors cany a limited number of SKUs-usually only a few\n\nthousand-in their distribution centers. PX09350-215, Table 22. These SKUs are ordinarily\n\nproprietary in nature and used only by the customers for which they were developed, meaning that\n\nsystems products are not readily sellable to other customers. Specialty distributors also carry a\n\nlimited number of SKUs, usually for niche products-such as fresh produce, meat, seafood, dairy,\n\nor bakery items-which tend to complement broadline offerings.          As Sysco's CEO William\n\nDeLaney explained: \"We own [specialty] to create great traction with our customers, ... we felt\n\nwe had some gaps in our [broadline] product offerings, whether it was special produce, special cut\n\nsteaks .... \" Investig'l Hr'g Tr., PX00580-010 at 38. Cash-and-carry stores likewise do not have\n\nthe same breadth and diversity of products as broadline distributors. One of the largest cash-and-\n\ncarry stores, Restaurant Depot, carries. SKUs. USF's CHEF' STORE carries less than 4,000.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f PX09350-216, Table 26.       A number of customer declarants stated that cash-and-carry store\n\n products tended to be less uniform and inferior in quality to products carried by broadliners.\n\n                        b,     Distinct facilities and operations\n\n        No one entering a systems, specialty, or cash-and-carry outlet would mistake it for a\n\n broadline distribution facility. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1079 (\"No one entering a Wal-Mart\n\n would mistake it for an office superstore .... You certainly know an office superstore when you\n\n see one.\"). Broadline distribution centers are massive. The average size of a Sysco distribution\n\ncenter is over 380,000 square feet; for USF, it is over 270,000 square feet.         Some regional\n\ndistributors also have distribution centers ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 square feet. PX09350-\n\n215, Table 25.    Non-broadline facilities are generally smaller in size and cannot readily be\n\nconverted into a broadline facility or accommodate broadline customers.\n\n        Broadline facilities also have large salesforces attached to them.      Broadline facilities\n\ntypically have dozens of sales representatives, while systems distributors have few sales\n\nrepresentatives at their facilities. PX09350-215, Table 23. Cash-and-carry stores generally do not\n\nhave dedicated account representatives at all. Because the model of distribution is self-service,\n\ncash-and-carry sales representatives do not learn the individualized needs of their customers in a\n\nsystematic manner.\n\n       Additional proof that broadline foodservice distribution is a separate product market comes\n\nfrom the corporate structure oflarge foodservice distributors. Major foodservice distributors offer\n\ndistribution in other channels besides broadline, but they run those businesses separately from their\n\nbroadline businesses. See, e.g., H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 56 (observing that digital do-it-\n\nyourself tax preparation was a distinct product market from assisted tax preparation because H&R\n\nBlock ran them as \"separate business units\").        Sysco runs its systems distribution business,\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f SYGMA, as a separate division. So, too, does PFG, which runs a systems business known as PFG\n\n Customized. Sysco also runs separate specialty divisions, such as Fresh Point, a fresh produce\n\n supplier. So, too, does PFG, which has its own specialty division, Roma, which supplies Italian\n\n restaurants and pizza parlors. And USF runs a separate cash-and-carry operation, CHEF' STORE.\n\n This type of corporate structuring shows that those who run and manage foodservice companies\n\nview broadline as distinct from other modes of distribution.\n\n                            c.       Delivery\n\n          Timely and reliable delivery is critical in the food distribution industry. Unless customers\n\ncan get the food they want when they need it, their businesses are at risk of losing clients and\n\nmoney. Broadliners have the capacity-due in large part to their extensive fleet of service\n\nvehicles, PX09350-217, Table 29-to offer frequent and flexible delivery schedules to meet\n\ncustomer needs, including next-day delivery. Ample evidence shows that, for a wide array of\n\nbroadline customers-from large GPOs to individually-owned restaurants-next-day delivery is\n\ncrucial to meeting their needs.\n\n         Neither systems distributors nor cash-and-carry stores offer the same degree of frequency\n\nand flexibility of delivery as broadliners. 3 Systems distributors tend to make large, limited-SKU\n\ndeliveries on a fixed schedule. Also, systems fleets, on average, travel longer distances than\n\nbroadline fleets to make deliveries. Carry-and-carry stores, for the most part, do not deliver.\n\nRather, their primary model is self-service-that is, the customer transports the merchandise on\n\nher own. Some cash-and-carry outlets do offer delivery options. Costco, for example, offers\n\nlimited-mileage delivery from some of its stores, and Restaurant Depot leases refrigerated trucks\n\n\n3\n  There was little evidence presented about the delivery capabilities of specialty distributors, aside from the fact that\nthey have a limited geographic range of delivery. See PX00427-002 (Sodexo declarant indicating that specialty\ndistributors covered a limited geographic range); PX00594-012 at 45 (MedAssets stating the same); PX00407-002\n(Amerinet stating the same).\n\n                                                          26\n\f to its best customers.     But those programs are quite limited and cannot substitute for the\n\n comprehensive and flexible delivery networks offered by broadliners to all of their customers.\n\n                       d.       Customer service and value-added services\n\n        Another distinguishing feature of broadline distributors is their high degree of customer\n\nservice and value-added service offerings. For example, broadliners offer menu and nutritional-\n\nmeal planning services to, among others, healthcare, hospitality, and restaurant customers. They\n\nalso offer value-added services at their distribution facilities, such as food safety training and new\n\nproduct updates. Other modes of delivery do not generally offer comparable value-added services.\n\n                       e.      Distinct customers\n\n        Due in large part to the breadth of their product and service offerings, broadliners are\n\ncapable of serving a wide range of customers, including classes of customers that the other\n\nchannels cannot reach. Systems is a more efficient and cost-effective mode of distribution for fast\n\nfood and quick service restaurants. Specialty distributors can provide higher quality and fresher\n\nproducts in certain categories, but have limited product offerings and charge higher prices than\n\nbroadliners. Cash-and-carry stores are less expensive and more accessible for buyers such as\n\nindependent restaurants, but their lack of delivery service makes them unsuitable for the large\n\nmajority of foodservice customers.\n\n       These other channels, therefore, simply cannot and do not serve as wide an array of\n\ncustomers as broadliners do.      The largest broadline customers, such as GPOs, foodservice\n\nmanagement companies, and hospitality providers, cannot use systems or cash-and-carry for their\n\nneeds. They purchase only modest quantities of product from specialty distributors. Even most\n\nindependent restaurants cannot use cash-and-carry stores as a reasonable substitute for their\n\nbroadliner, even though such stores offer lower prices.\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\f                       f       Distinct pricing\n\n         Broadliners generally compete only against other broadliners on pricing. PFG's President\n\nand CEO, George Holm, who has over 37 years of industry experience, testified that systems and\n\nspecialty distributors do not significantly affect the pricing and services that PFG offers to its\n\ncustomers. Hr' g Tr. 575-76, 643. And, although broadliners recognize that cash-and-carry stores\n\nprovide lower prices, the record does not show broadliners benchmarking their prices against cash-\n\nand-carry stores or lowering prices to compete with them. To the contrary, as USF's Executive\n\nVice President of Strategy David Schreibman succinctly stated in an email comparing pricing\n\nbetween USF as a broadliner and its own cash-and-carry division, CHEF' STORE: \"In the store,\n\nwe will be competitive with                   on a similar cost model. On the truck, we will be\n\ncompetitive with broadline distributors on a similar cost model.\" PX03l14-003.\n\n                       g.      Industry or public recognition\n\n        Overwhelmingly, the evidence shows that players m the foodservice distribution\n\nindustry-both its suppliers and customers-recognize broadline, systems, specialty, and cash-\n\nand-carry to be distinct modes of distribution. See Rothery Storage, 792 F.2d at 219 n.4 (\"The\n\n'industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic' unit matters because we\n\nassume that economic actors usually have accurate perceptions of economic realities.\"). The court\n\nreceived both live and out-of-court sworn testimony from Defendants' executives; executives from\n\nother broadline distributors; officers of non-broadline companies; and customers, large and small.\n\nThey uniformly observed that these modes of distribution are distinct in the variety of ways\n\ndescribed above. In short, the industry widely recognizes that broadline distributors offer a unique\n\ncluster of products and services that is not functionally interchangeable with other modes of\n\ndistribution.\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f                        h,      Defendants' response to Brown Shoe \"practical indicia\"\n\n        Defendants do not, for the most part, contest the above-described distinctions between\n\n broadline and other channels of distribution.        Instead, Defendants contend that defining the\n\n relevant market to include only broadliners \"misunderstands consumer behavior.\" Memo ofDefs.\n\n Sysco Corp., USP Holding Corp. and US Foods, Inc., in Opp'n to Pis.' Mot. for A Prehm Inj.,\n\nECF No. 130 at 19 [hereinafter Defs.' Opp'n Br.]. They argue \"customers simultaneously can,\n\nand routinely do, choose to patronize competitors of all stripes offering fungible goods through\n\ndifferent but overlapping distribution channels.\" Id. What matters, Defendants claim, is that non-\n\nbroadliners are able to constrain a broadliner's pricing by competing for customers who are able\n\nto move their entire purchasing, or portions of their purchasing, between channels. Id. at 19\n\n(\"Whether a substitute channel is a 'comprehensive' substitute is irrelevant to that question.\").\n\nDefendants offer as one compelling example the burger chain Five Guys, which recently re-\n\nallocated over $300 million in annual business from USP to a collection of regional broadliners\n\nand systems distributors.\n\n        Defendants are indisputably correct that customers buy across channels, especially\n\nindependent restaurants. They are also unquestionably correct that some customers, particularly\n\nquick service and fast food restaurant chains, are capable of moving large segments of business\n\nfrom broadline to systems. But the fact that Defendants sometimes compete against other channels\n\nof distribution in the larger marketplace does not mean that those alternative channels belong in\n\nthe relevant product market for purposes of merger analysis. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1075\n\n(\"[T]he mere fact that a firm may be termed a competitor in the overall marketplace does not\n\nnecessarily require that it be included in the relevant product market for antitrust purposes.\"); see\n\nalso Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis ofAntitrust Principles\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f and Their Application~ 565b (4th ed. 2014) (\"[I]t would be improper to group complementary\n\n goods into the same relevant market just because they occasionally substitute for one another.\n\n Substitution must be effective to hold the primary good to a price near its costs[.]\").\n\n        Two key decisions from this jurisdiction, Whole Foods and Staples, support this\n\nconclusion. In Whole Foods, the question was whether there existed a product market for premium\n\nnatural and organic supermarkets (\"PNOS\") separate from ordinary supermarkets. The Court of\n\nAppeals' ultimate decision was fractured-each judge issued a separate opinion, leaving no\n\ncontrolling opinion from the Court. Two judges, however, concluded that PNOS is a separate\n\nproduct market from ordinary supermarkets, even though there was evidence that customers\n\n\"cross-shopp[ed]\" between the two. 548 F.3d at 1040 (Brown, J.); id. (\"But the fact that PNOS\n\nand ordinary supermarkets 'are direct competitors in some submarkets ... is not the end of the\n\ninquiry.\"') (quoting United States v. Conn. Nat.

Both judges agreed that just because customers were able to buy\n\nsome categories of grocery products from both outlets-similar to how broadline customers are\n\nable to purchase some products from other modes of distribution-did not mean that PNOS was\n\nin the same product market as grocery stores. See id. at 1040 (Brown, J.) (citing testimony that\n\n\"Whole Foods competes actively with conventional supermarkets for dry groceries sales, even\n\nthough it ignores their prices for high-quality perishables\"); id. at 1049 (Tatel, J.) (\"As Judge\n\nBrown's opinion explains, this suggests that any competition between Whole Foods and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\f    conventional retailers may be limited to a narrow range of products that play a minor role in Whole\n\n    Food's profitability.\").\n\n           The court in Staples held much the same. There, the question was whether consumable\n\n    office supplies sold by office superstores constituted a separate product market from office\n\n    supplies sold elsewhere. See Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. at 1073. The court acknowledged that no\n\n    matter who sells them, office supply products-to some extent, like food products-are\n\n    \"undeniably the same.\" Id at 1075. The court nevertheless held that the sale of office supplies\n\n through superstores constituted the relevant product market. \"[T]he unique combination of size,\n\n selection, depth and breadth of inventory offered by the superstores distinguishes them from other\n\n retailers.\" Id at 1079. Those words apply with equal force to broadline distributors relative to\n\nother food distribution channels. See also Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 47 (concluding that\n\nthe wholesale drug industry \"provide[s] customers with an efficient way to obtain prescription\n\ndrugs through centralized warehousing, delivery, and billing services that enable the customers to\n\navoid carrying large inventories, dealing with large number of vendors, and negotiating numerous\n\ntransactions\").\n\n           Defendants have not convincingly distinguished Whole Foods or Staples. 4 Instead, they\n\nurge the court to look to United States v. Sungard Data Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2308890\"><a href=\"/opinion/2308890/united-states-v-sungard-data-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

At oral argument, Defendants\ndistinguished Staples based on the fact that in Staples the FTC had pricing data to show that prices were lower in\nmarkets where both merging firms were present. Closing Arg. Hr' g Tr. at 38-40. Defendants also sought to distinguish\nWhole Foods on the facts, arguing that in Whole Foods the defendants could not show that in the event of a price\nincrease consumers of PNOS could go to a standard grocery store. Id. at 40-41. But the court finds these efforts to\ndistinguish Staples and Whole Foods unconvincing. It is true that there was stronger pricing data in Staples, but\npricing data alone did not lead to the court's conclusion. The factual similarities between this case and Staples,\nparticularly the Brown Shoe practical indicia, are otherwise strong. As for Whole Foods, it is even more factually\nanalogous to this case than is Staples. If anything, the proof that other channels of distribution are not reasonable\nsubstitutes for broadline is more compelling in this case than the evidence in Whole Foods that ordinary grocery stores\nare not a reasonable substitute for PNOS.\n\n                                                         31\n\f2001), as an analogous case. There, the question was whether different types of disaster recovery\n\nservices for computer data comprised the same product market. Id. at 183. The court rejected the\n\ngovernment's product market definition as limited only to shared hotsite services because \"the\n\ngovernment's market contains an extremely heterogeneous group of customers,\" id. at 182, who\n\n\"are simply too varied and too dissimilar to support any generalizations,\" id. at 193. Here, it is\n\nunquestionably true that foodservice distribution customers are incredibly varied in their needs,\n\nbuying habits, and price sensitivities. But Sungard differs in one critical respect. The court there\n\nobserved that \"the striking heterogeneity of the market, particularly as reflected by the conflicting\n\nevidence relating to customer perceptions and practices,\" undercut the government's market\n\ndefinition. Id. at 182-83 (emphasis added). Here, that simply is not the case. Though the\n\ncustomers may be varied, the court has little doubt that the industry, from the perspective of both\n\nsellers and buyers, perceives broadline to be a separate mode of food distribution. Witnesses of\n\nall stripes had little trouble distinguishing among the different channels of distribution, and\n\nDefendants offered no evidence of any industry confusion among them. Those facts make this\n\ncase fundamentally different from Sungard. See id. at 183 (\"Customer responses were also often\n\nvague and confused\" and product definitions were \"consistently unclear.\").\n\n       Defendants also argue that the FTC's definition of broadline as the relevant market\n\nimproperly excludes other modes based on \"a small number of customers' subjective preferences\n\nfor broadline distribution.\" Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 17 (footnote omitted). But the evidence, as it\n\nrelates to broadline versus other distribution channels, is hardly selective. Defendants' own\n\nexecutives acknowledged the fundamental differences between broadline and other modes of\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f    distribution. 5 So, too, did executives of regional broadliners, such as PFG, 6 Sharnrock,7 Reinhart\n\n    Foodservice, 8 and Shetakis9 ; consortiums, such as UniPro 10 ; systems distributors, such as\n\n    Maines 11 ; and cash-and-carry stores, such as Restaurant Depot. 12 Likewise, customers of every\n\n    size recognized the differences between broadline and the other food distribution modes. In short,\n\n this is not the kind of case in which the testimonial evidence failed to demonstrate a consensus\n\n among the industry's players regarding the boundaries of the product market.\n\n                   3.       Expert Testimony\n\n           Having concluded that the Brown Shoe \"practical indicia\" support a product market for\n\n broadline foodservice distribution, the court turns next to the second type of evidence that courts\n\n consider in product market definition: expert testimony in the field of economics. One of the\n\nprimary methods used by economists to determine a product market is called the \"hypothetical\n\nmonopolist test.\" This test asks whether a hypothetical monopolist who has control over a set of\n\nsubstitutable products could profitably raise prices on those products. If so, the products may\n\ncomprise the relevant product market. See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-52. The theory\n\nbehind the test is straightforward. If enough consumers are able to substitute away from the\n\n\n\n5\n   See, e.g., DX-00319 at 32-36 (Sysco's CEO, William DeLaney, explained that systems is a \"tailored, customized\napproach to certain types of customers\" and the \"model is not to serve GPO customers\"); Hr' g Tr. 1369-70 (DeLaney\nstated that, compared to cash-and-carry, broadline is a \"value package\" that includes delivery services and menu\nconsulting); Hr'g Tr. 1452 (David Schreibman ofUSF stated that \"specialty distributors compete by having a broader\narray of products within their expertise\" that \"broadliner[s] may not have in [their] portfolio\"); Investigat'l Hr'g Tr.,\nPX00580-008-010 at 32-39 (DeLaney explained that broadline and specialty are \"two different businesses,\" whereas\nbroadline distribution includes \"a full range of products\"); Investigat' l Hr' g Tr., PX00584-060 at 239-40 (Louis Nasir,\nthe Pacific Market President for Sysco, maintained that cash-and-carry stores \"don't have the same selection\" of\nproducts and \"also don't have consistent inventory\" compared with broadliners); Investigat'l Hr'g Tr., PX00590-0l l\nat 42 (Schreibman stated that he was not aware of a cash-and-carry store that delivers).\n6\n   See PX00429-002-007; Hr'g Tr. 571-73.\n7\n   DX-00285 at 115-16, 164-66.\n8\n   DX-00295 at 16-17, 22.\n9\n   PX004l4-001.\n10\n    DX-00260 at 139.\n11\n   DX-00264 at 64, 141; PX00424-001 (Maines is predominantly systems, butl percent of2013 revenues were from\nbroadline sales).\n12\n    DX-00314 at 146-47.\n\n                                                          33\n\f hypothetical monopolist's product to another product and thereby make a pnce mcrease\n\n unprofitable, then the relevant market cannot include only the monopolist's product and must also\n\n include the substitute goods. On the other hand, if the hypothetical monopolist could profitably\n\n raise price by a small amount, even with the loss of some customers, then economists consider the\n\nmonopolist's product to constitute the relevant market.\n\n        The hypothetical monopolist test, which courts have applied, is set forth in the\n\nU.S. Department of Justice and FTC's Horizontal Merger Guidelines. See U.S. Dep't of Justice &\n\nFTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 4.1.1 (2010) [hereinafter Merger Guidelines]; H&R Block,\n\n833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-52; CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 40; Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 120\n\n& n. 7. As stated in the Merger Guidelines:\n\n        [T]he test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm, not subject to price\n        regulation, that was the only present and future seller of those products ... likely\n        would impose at least a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price\n        (\"SSNIP\") on at least one product in the market, including at least one product sold\n        by one of the merging firms.\n\nMerger Guidelines§ 4.1.1. The SSNIP \"is intended to represent a 'small but significant' increase\n\nin the prices charged by firms in the candidate market\" and is typically assumed to be \"five percent\n\nof the price paid by customers for the products or services to which the merging firms contribute\n\nvalue.\" Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.2.\n\n        As applied to this case, the hypothetical monopolist test asks: If there was only one\n\nbroadline food distributor, could it profitably raise price by five percent, or would that price increase\n\nresult in a substantial number of customers moving enough of their spend to other modes of\n\ndistribution-systems, specialty, or cash-and-carry-such that the price increase would be\n\nunprofitable? If the price increase would be profitable, then the relevant product market is broadline\n\ndistribution; if unprofitable, it means that the relevant market must include at least one other channel\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\f of distribution.       Each side presented expert testimony from economists who performed the\n\n hypothetical monopolist test but who came to different results.\n\n                             a.       Dr. Mark Israel\n\n            For its expert economic evidence, the FTC presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Israel, who\n\n received a doctorate in economics from Stanford University and now serves as Executive Vice\n\n President at Compass Lexecon, a consulting firm. Dr. Israel's testimony served two primary\n\n functions. First, he acted as a de facto summary witness, synthesizing the mass of testimonial and\n\n documentary evidence gathered by the FTC. Dr. Israel's summary of that evidence parallels the\n\n discussion in the above sub-sections, so the court does not revisit it here. Second, Dr. Israel\n\n conducted a SSNIP test, using what is known as an \"aggregate diversion analysis.\" Its purpose is\n\n to determine the amount of sales that a hypothetical monopolist of broadline distribution could\n\n lose before a price increase becomes unprofitable. See Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 160\n\n (describing the related methodology of\"critical loss analysis\"); H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 63\n\n(same). A detailed recitation of Dr. Israel's aggregate diversion analysis is necessary because\n\nDefendants challenge the basic elements of his work.\n\n            Aggregate diversion analysis has three basic steps. The first is to determine the threshold\n\naggregate diversion ratio, which is the percentage of customers that would need to stay within the\n\nbroadline market to make a price increase profitable. See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 63. This\n\nis strictly a mathematical step, with the aggregate diversion ratio a function of the subject product's\n\ngross margin. The gross margin is defined as the price of selling one additional product minus the\n\ncost of selling the additional product. 13 The second step is to determine the actual aggregate\n\ndiversion-that is, the actual percentage of customers of a single broadliner that would switch to\n\n\n\n13\n     Gross margin is calculated as follows: (Revenue-Cost of Goods Sold)/Revenue.\n\n                                                        35\n\f another broadliner after a price increase. \"Since these lost sales are recaptured within the proposed\n\n market, they are not lost to the hypothetical monopolist.\" Id. As will be seen, this step involved\n\n an analysis of Defendants' actual sales data. The final step is to compare the two: if the actual\n\n aggregate diversion is greater than the threshold ratio, then the hypothetical monopolist could\n\n profitably raise prices and the candidate market is the relevant product market. See id. In other\n\n words, as applied here, if the percentage of customers of a single broadliner who would switch to\n\n another broadliner (as opposed to another mode of distribution) in response to a price increase is\n\n greater than the percentage of customers needed to stay within the market to make a price increase\n\nprofitable, then the relevant product market is properly defined as broadline distribution.\n\n          At step one of his aggregate diversion analysis, Dr. Israel assumed a gross margin of\n\n 10 percent, a figure lower than the gross margin contained in the parties' financial reporting. 14\n\nA 10 percent gross margin, according to Dr. Israel, yields a 50 percent threshold aggregate\n\ndiversion ratio based on a formula devised by two economists, Michael Katz and Carl Shapiro. 15\n\n          Next, Dr. Israel calculated the actual aggregate diversion based on three different data sets.\n\nHe constructed the first two data sets from national and regional requests for proposals (\"RFPs\")\n\nand \"bidding\" summary information and documents produced by each Defendant to the FTC.\n\nBased on this information, Dr. Israel built a database for each company that tracked, for each\n\nbidding opportunity, the incumbent distributor, the winning distributor, and the competing bidders.\n\nPX09350-104.         Based on Sysco's RFP/bidding data, he found that, when Sysco lost a bid,\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Dr. Israel testified that the parties' reported gross margins are between 15 and 20 percent, but to be conservative he\nused a 10 percent margin. Hr'g Tr. 1004-05.\n15\n   The Katz-Shapiro formula that Dr. Israel used is L =XI(){+ M), where L is the aggregate diversion ratio, or \"critical\nloss,\" X is the price increase, and M is the margin. PX09350-055 at n.134. For his aggregate diversion analysis,\nDr. Israel used a 10 percent price increase and a 10 percent margin, for a resulting critical loss of 50 percent, i.e., .50\n= .10/(.10 + .10). Hr'g Tr. 1004-07.\n\n                                                           36\n\f broad.liner; the remaining losses were to another mode of distribution. PX09350-056. Based on\n\nUSF's RFP/bidding data, the percentage was even higher-USF lost to other broadliner-\n\nHtffl of the time.   Id.\n\n        Dr. Israel constructed his third data set from USF's \"Linc\" database. Linc is a customer\n\nrelations management tool that USF local sales representatives used until recently to track sales\n\nopportunities. The Linc database contains fields that sales representatives can complete to describe\n\na sales opportunity, including a \"main competition\" field. Dr. Israel assumed that, if USF did not\n\nwin an opportunity, it was won by the identified \"main competitor.\" The Linc database contained\n\nhundreds of thousands of observations, about a third of which included information on the \"main\n\ncompetitor.\"\n\nopportunities lost by USF (again, based on potential revenue of those sales opportunities) were\n\nlost to other broadliners. PX09350-056.\n\n       At the third step, Dr. Israel compared the aggregate diversion ratio of 50 percent to the\n\nactual diversion percentages derived from the three data sets. He concluded that, because each of\n\nthe three actual diversion percentages was higher than the 50 percent threshold aggregate diversion\n\nratio, broadline distribution was the relevant product market. In other words, Dr. Israel found that\n\nonly 50 percent of broadline customers would need to remain within the broadline market to make\n\na price increase profitable, while according to three different data sets, the actual percentage of\n\ncustomers who would remain within the broadline market (by switching to another broadliner) was\n\ngreater than 50 percent. Therefore, Dr. Israel's calculations indicated that broadline distribution\n\nwas the relevant product market.\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f                            b,       Defendants' experts\n\n          Defendants mounted an aggressive challenge to Dr. Israel's work through their own expert\n\n witnesses.      Defendants first presented Dr. Jerry Hausman, a professor of economics at\n\n Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Hausman testified, in short, that Dr. Israel's aggregate\n\n diversion analysis was wrong because (i) he used the wrong gross margin and (ii) he used the\n\n wrong mathematical formula to calculate the threshold aggregate diversion ratio. According to\n\n Dr. Hausman, Dr. Israel excluded certain variable costs from his gross margin. The actual gross\n\n margin was not 10 percent, according to Dr. Hausman, but between                   II percent and II percent.\nAlso, Dr. Hausman testified that the aggregate diversion formula Dr. Israel used was incorrect and\n\nled to an overly narrow market definition. 16 Using the proper margins and the correct formula,\n\nDr. Hausman opined, the aggregate diversion ratio is not 50 percent, but rather over 100 percent,\n\nwhich is an impossibility (i.e., more than 100 percent of customers cannot switch in response to a\n\nprice increase). Thus, he concluded, the relevant product market is not broadline, but all channels\n\nof food distribution.\n\n         While Dr. Hausman challenged Dr. Israel's calculation of the threshold aggregate diversion\n\nratio, Defendants' other expert, Dr. Timothy Bresnahan, a professor of economics at Stanford\n\nUniversity, critiqued Dr. Israel's use of the RFP/bidding and Linc data sets to calculate the actual\n\naggregate diversion.        Regarding the RFP/bidding data, Dr. Bresnahan described the data as\n\ncontrived and unreliable-a point that Defendants consistently articulated to the FTC during the\n\ninvestigation phase. Dr. Bresnahan explained that the companies do not keep comprehensive RFP\n\n\n\n16\n   According to Dr. Hausman, the correct formula is L = XIM, where L is the aggregate diversion ratio, or \"critical\nloss,\" Xis the price increase, and Mis the margin. Dr. Hausman testified that this is the more appropriate formula in\nan asymmetric market, like food distribution, which involves suppliers and customers with different costs, different\ntypes of customers, and a different mix of products. Hr'g Tr. 1960-64; DFF at 285-86 (citing to DX-05028 at 11).\nThe formula used by Dr. Israel, on the other hand, is more appropriate in a symmetric market, that is, a market marked\nby homogeneity among suppliers and customers. Hr'g Tr. 1960, 1965-66; DX-05028 at 10-11.\n\n                                                         38\n\f or bidding data in the ordinary course of business and that the information Dr. Israel relied upon\n\n was pulled together at the insistence of the FTC, in part based on employees' unreliable notes and\n\n memories. As for the Linc data, it too was flawed, Dr. Bresnahan suggested, because it is a\n\n prospective sales database, not an actual transactions database in which USF sales personnel were\n\n accurately recording wins and losses. Moreover, neither the RFP/bidding data nor the Linc data\n\n describes whether Sysco or USF lost a customer for a price-based reason or some reason having\n\nnothing to do with price.\n\n                           c.       The court's finding as to the expert testimony\n\n          Having weighed the competing expert testimonies and considered them in light of the\n\nevidentiary record as a whole, the court finds Dr. Israel's aggregate diversion analysis and\n\nconclusion to be more persuasive than that advanced by Defendants' expert, Dr. Hausman. 17\n\nDr. Israel's reliance on the RFP/bidding and Linc data sets for calculating the aggregate diversion\n\nis problematic for the reasons Defendants have identified and, for those reasons, the court hesitates\n\nto rely on Dr. Israel's precise aggregate diversion percentages. But, when evaluated against the\n\nrecord as a whole, Dr. Israel's conclusions are more consistent with the business realities of the\n\nfood distribution market than Dr. Hausman's. See Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 46 (stating\n\nthat \"the determination of the relevant market in the end is 'a matter of business reality-[ ] of\n\nhow the market is perceived by those who strive for profit in it.\"' (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nFTC v.

Supp. 2d at 65 (bearing in mind the shortcomings of the\n\n expert's analysis and treating the analysis as \"another data point\" in determining the relevant\n\n market, rather than as conclusive).\n\n          The court finds Dr. Hausman's conclusion-that the actual aggregate diversion ratio is\n\n greater than 100 percent-inconsistent with business reality. On cross-examination, Dr. Hausman\n\n admitted that his conclusion meant that a hypothetical monopolist who had control over every\n\n single broadline distributor in the country could not profitably impose a SSNIP on customers,\n\n because enough customers would switch to other channels of distribution. Hr'g Tr. 2003-04. Yet\n\n many industry leaders testified either that other channels of distribution did not constrain the prices\n\ncharged by broadliners or that other channels were not substitutes for broadline distribution.

Hr' g Tr. 575-76. He also testified that systems and specialty distributors were not\n\nsubstitutes for broadliners. Hr'g Tr. 573.

National Broadline Distribution as a Relevant Product Market\n\n        The FTC asserts that, within the broader product market for broad.line distribution, there is\n\na narrower but distinct product market for \"broad.line foodservice distribution services sold to\n\nNational Customers.\" CompI. if 44.

National customers include healthcare GPOs; foodservice management companies; and large\n\nhotel and restaurant chains. Id    if 41. The FTC contends that Sysco and USF \"are the only two\nsingle-firm broadline distributors with national geographic reach and, as such, are best positioned\n\nto serve National Customers.\" Id.    if 63.\n       Defendants vigorously dispute that there is such a thing as a \"National Customer.\" They\n\ncontend that a product market built around so-called national customers is \"contrived,'' Defs.'\n\nOpp'n Br. at 16, and that the FTC's distinction between national and local customers is \"factually\n\nand economically meaningless,'' id at 13. They counter that the national-local distinction is not,\n\nas the FTC claims, built on differentiating customer characteristics, but is improperly based on an\n\nadministrative distinction as to whether the customer prefers to be managed at the corporate level\n\n                                                  41\n\f (making it a \"national\" customer) or at the local distribution center (making it a \"local\" customer).\n\n Id. at 12-15. The so-called national customer category, they also argue, is improperly based on a\n\n \"few core customers who say they prefer the merging parties.\" Id. at 13. In addition, Defendants\n\n assert that Dr. Israel did not perform a SSNIP test to assess the existence of a national customer\n\n market. Id. at 12.\n\n                !.      Legal Basis for Defining Relevant Product Market Based on Customer Type\n\n        Before turning to the evidence, the court first considers the legal basis for defining a\n\nproduct market based on a type of customer. Neither side comprehensively addressed this issue.\n\nAdmittedly, defining a product market based on a type of customer seems incongruous. After all,\n\none ordinarily thinks of a customer as purchasing a product in the market, and not as the product\n\nmarket itself But, in this case, according to the FTC, the national customer and broadline product\n\nconverge to define a market for broadline products sold to national customers.             Broadline\n\ndistributors must offer a particular kind of \"product\"-a cluster of goods and services that can be\n\ndelivered across a broad geographic area-to compete for national customers. In that sense, the\n\ncustomer's requirements operate to define the product offering itself\n\n        The clearest articulation of this approach to product market definition comes from the\n\nMerger Guidelines. The Merger Guidelines are not binding, but the Court of Appeals and other\n\ncourts have looked to them for guidance in previous merger cases. See, e.g., Heinz, 246 F.3d at\n\n716 n.9; H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 52 n.10. Section 4.1.4 of the Merger Guidelines provides\n\nthat \"[i]f a hypothetical monopolist could profitably target a subset of customers for price\n\nincreases, the Agencies may identify relevant markets defined around those targeted customers, to\n\nwhom a hypothetical monopolist would profitably and separately impose at least a SSNIP.\"\n\nMerger Guidelines § 4.1.4.      Markets to serve targeted customers are also known as \"price\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f discrimination markets.\" Id. Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp have endorsed market definition\n\n of this kind, as well: \"Successful price discrimination means that the disfavored geographic or\n\n product class is insulated from the favored class and, if the discrimination is of sufficient\n\n magnitude, should be counted as a separate relevant market.\" 2B Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert\n\n Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis ofAnt;trust Prindples and Their Application~ 534d (3d\n\n ed. 2007). The concern underlying price discrimination markets is that certain types of captured\n\n or dedicated customers could be targeted for monopolist pricing even if a price increase for all\n\n customers would not be profitable. See Merger Guidelines § 3; Areeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed.,\n\nsupra,~    533d (\"[S]ellers may be able to discriminate against buyers who have fewer alternatives\n\nor for whom the product performs a more valuable function[.]\").\n\n         Defining a market around a targeted customer, as the FTC urges here, is not free from\n\ncontroversy, as the different opinions in Whole Foods demonstrate. 19 Relying on an earlier version\n\nof the Merger Guidelines that recognized price discrimination against \"targeted buyers,\"\n\nJudge Brown explained that \"core consumers\"-in that case, those committed to premium and\n\nnatural organic supermarkets-\"can, in appropriate circumstances, be worthy of antitrust\n\nprotection.\" Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1037 (Brown, J.) (citing DOJ and FTC, 1992 Horizontal\n\nMerger Guidelines§ 1.12, 57 Fed. Reg. 41,552, 41,555 (1992)). Judge Brown went on to say:\n\n         In particular, when one or a few firms differentiate themselves by offering a\n         particular package of goods or services, it is quite possible for there to be a central\n         group of customers for whom \"only [that package] will do.\" ... Such customers\n         may be captive to the sole supplier, which can then, by means of price\n         discrimination, extract monopoly profits from them while competing for the\n         business of marginal customers.\n\n\n\n\n19\n   The FTC cites to the \"distinct customers\" factor in Brown Shoe as support for defining a market around a targeted\ncustomer. However, Brown Shoe only listed \"distinct customers\" as one of many factors for courts to consider in\ndefining a market. Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. It did not endorse defining a market around a group of targeted\ncustomers.\n\n                                                        43\n\f Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1038 (Brown, J.) (quoting Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 574) (alteration in\n\n original).\n\n          Judge Kavanaugh, in dissent, rejected defining a market around a \"core customer.\" Whole\n\n Foods, 548 F.3d at 1062 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). According to Judge Kavanaugh, \"there is\n\n no support in the law for that singular focus on the core customer. Indeed, if that approach took\n\n root, it would have serious repercussions because virtually every merger involves some core\n\n customers who would stick with the company regardless of a significant price increase. \" 20 Id. The\n\n relevant question for market definition, according to Judge Kavanaugh, is not whether a die-hard\n\ngroup of core customers would be impacted by a substantial price increase, but whether the merged\n\ncompany \"could increase prices by five percent or more without losing so many marginal\n\ncustomers as to make the price increase unprofitable.\" Id.\n\n                   2.        Evidence Supporting a National Broadline Product Market\n\n          Ultimately, the court here need not resolve the Whole Foods disagreement over defining a\n\nmarket around a \"core\" customer. That is because the ordinary factors that courts consider in\n\ndefining a market-the Brown Shoe practical indicia and the Merger Guidelines' SSNIP test-\n\nsupport a finding that broadline distribution to national customers is a relevant product market.\n\nSee, e.g., Areeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed.,              supra,~     533d (\"If the defendant can profit by charging\n\npharmacies a price significantly over its cost, then the pharmacy sales are a relevant market[.]\").\n\n\n\n\n20\n   The Merger Guidelines do not, for instance, set forth how a court is to distinguish a \"targeted\" group of customers\nfrom customers in general. This gives rise to the question of what limiting principles or factors a court should apply\nin defining a price discrimination market. Absent limitations, price discrimination against a single customer might be\nused to justify blocking a merger. This is not a mere theoretical possibility. According to the Merger Guidelines, \"[i]f\nprices are negotiated individually with customers, the hypothetical monopolist test may suggest relevant markets that\nare as narrow as individual customers.\" Merger Guidelines § 4.1.4 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                          44\n\f                       a.      Industry and public recognition\n\n         Among the most compelling evidence supporting a product market for national customers\n\nis the fact that regional broadliners have formed cooperatives, such as DMA and MUG, to compete\n\nfor customers with a geographically dispersed footprint. Regional distributors, because of their\n\nlimited footprints, do not have the capacity to serve customers with multi-regional needs across all\n\nof their locations.   Only Sysco and USF have that capacity. These cooperatives were formed\n\nspecifically to compete against Sysco and USF, by enabling regional competitors to combine to\n\nprovide nationwide or multi-regional delivery and, importantly, to offer a single point of contact\n\nfor the customer. Dan Cox, the President and CEO ofDMA, explained that DMA was formed in\n\n1988 as a competitive response to Sysco' s merger with another company, Continental. See\n\nPX00565-051 at 202. He explained that \"[w]hen that industry event took place, it was the first\n\ntime that there was truly a national platform for foodservice distribution.\" Id. Put simply, business\n\nventures like DMA would not exist if there were not a separate market for customers who have\n\nnational or multi-regional distribution needs. See Rothery Storage, 792 F.2d at 218 n.4 (stating\n\nthat courts must \"assume that economic actors usually have accurate perceptions of economic\n\nrealities\").\n\n        Equally compelling evidence of the national-local distinction comes from a report done by\n\nthe management consulting firm, McK.insey & Co., whom Sysco hired to assist with merger\n\nintegration.   After closely analyzing the two companies' operations, McKinsey prepared a\n\npresentation in July 2014, titled \"National, Intermediate, and Field Coverage Models.\" The\n\npresentation observed that \"Sysco and US Foods have different approaches to grouping customers\n\nand determining service models .... Both companies effectively operate two service models with\n\ndistinct capabilities to serve two types of customers.\" PX09010-002 (emphasis added). The\n\n\n\n                                                45\n\f presentation described \"National Customers\" as those who \"use complex contracts with margin\n\n schedules, make online purchases of proprietary products, require auditing support, and coordinate\n\n across multiple markets.\" Id. By contrast, \"Field Customers\" were those who \"make weekly\n\npurchases through in-person consultations, receive specialist support tailored to independent\n\nrestaurants, require minimal auditing support, and operate in I or few markets.\" Id. McKinsey\n\nfurther observed that national customers' \"requirements\" included \"[ s]et margin schedule\n\ncontract[s]\"; \"[e]fficient ordering across multiple locations\"; \"[l]arge number[s] of deviated,\n\nproprietary and close-coded products\"; \"[r]egulatory and audit support\"; \"[i]n-depth reporting\";\n\nand \"[c]onsistency of service, pricing and products across multiple [m]arkets.\" PX09010-004.\n\nField customers' \"requirements,\" on the other hand, included the \"[a]bility to make decisions each\n\nweek along with consultation\"; \"[a]ccess to national, commodity, and some proprietary products\";\n\n\"[f]ull business, culinary, and product support for independent businesses\"; and \"minimal\"\n\n\"[c]oordination across geographies.\" Id. McKinsey ultimately recommended that the companies\n\nrecognize and build a new service model around a third kind of customer-an \"Intermediate\"\n\ncustomer-who would be identifiable based on five variables: (i) national contract/no contract;\n\n(ii) nature of industry; (iii) number of markets; (iv) number of regions; and (v) size of annual sales.\n\nPX09010-007. The McKinsey presentation identified as \"conclusively\" national those customers\n\nwho operate in three or more markets or two or more regions. Id.\n\n       McKinsey is not the only industry analyst or expert to acknowledge that national customers\n\nform a market distinct from local buyers. Cleveland Research Company, an investment research\n\nfirm, produced an analyst report on Sysco after the merger's announcement and recognized that\n\nSysco and USF serve a distinct group of national customers. One of the report's conclusions was\n\nthat \"Sysco/USP will [be] able to keep most of their larger contracted and national account\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\f customers for the near- and medium-term due to national scale and existing contracts .... Based\n\n on our research, most national operators prefer to deal with one distributor because it is more\n\n efficient and less expensive than dealing with several regional players.\" PX09332-006 (emphasis\n\n added).\n\n           The industry's trade group, the International Food Distributors Association (\"IFDA\"), also\n\n recognizes a distinction between national and local customers.        IFDA produces a Quarterly\n\n Operations survey that reports separate sales figures for \"national\" and \"street\" accounts.\n\nPX00570-004 at 78. IFDA's President, Mark Allen, explained that IFDA distinguishes between\n\nthe two because \"the dynamics between the two [types of] businesses might be a little bit different.\n\nThe operating metrics might be a little bit different.\" Id. at 80.\n\n        Defendants' ordinary course documents also recognize the national-local distinction and\n\ntout their strategic advantage as to the former. See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 52 (\"When\n\ndetermining the relevant product market, courts often pay close attention to the defendants'\n\nordinary course of business documents.\").        A Sysco \"Investor Day\" presentation from 2010\n\ndistinguishes the company's \"Contract Sales (Broadline)\" from \"Street Sales,\" PX03101-010, and\n\nseparates its \"Key Competitors - National,\" from regional competitors, PX03101-020. Similarly,\n\na presentation entitled \"Board of Directors Strategy Sessions,\" dated July 2010, distinguishes\n\nbetween Sysco's market size for \"corporate contracts\"-defined to include \"major foodservice\n\nmanagement (FSM) sales, major group purchasing organization (GPO) sales, and major chain\n\nsales (non FSM or GPO)\"-and \"Street\" business. PX01008-006.\n\n       USF has similar documents. An internal USF presentation, titled \"Business Overview,\"\n\ndescribes \"[USF's] Customers\" as falling into three categories: (i) \"Street: Independent restaurants\n\nor small local chains\"; (ii) \"National Accounts: Contracted customers located across the country,\"\n\n\n\n                                                  47\n\fincluding acute and long-term healthcare facilities, hotels and the hospitality industry, schools, and\n\nUS. military and government agencies; and (iii) \"National Chain Restaurants: Fast food and\n\nquick-serve establishments.\" PX03122-004. See also PX03034-006 (similarly categorizing the\n\ncompany's customers). A USF \"Investor Presentation\" from November 2012 describes USF as\n\nthe \"2nd largest national broadline distributor,\" PX03000-006, and touts its \"[a]bility to leverage\n\nour national scale to cost effectively service customers nationally,\" PX03000-014. Further, it\n\ndistinguishes between \"National Scale,\" where \"US Foods is the second-largest broadline\n\nfoodservice distributor in the US.,\" and \"Local Scale,\" where \"US Foods is estimated #1 or #2\n\nposition in   II of served markets,\" PX03000-014.     See also PX03007-007 (internal document in\n\nwhich KKR & Co., one of USF's private equity owners, distinguishes between \"Street and\n\nNational Account customer segments\").\n\n       Other key players in the industry also recognize that national customers are different.\n\nFor instance, the President and CEO of PFG, George Holm, agreed that \"Sysco and US Foods are\n\nthe only two distributors for broadline with the capability to serve national broadline customers\n\nwith locations dispersed throughout the United States,\" including foodservice management\n\ncompanies, GPOs, large healthcare systems, and certain restaurant chains.             Hr'g Tr. 596.\n\nRepresentatives of DMA and Reinhart likewise referred to national customers as those that are\n\ngeographically dispersed and need a single point of contact. See PX00412-002-003; PX00415-\n\n004.\n\n                       b.     Distinct customer needs\n\n       There is ample record evidence that national customers' needs differ from those of local\n\ncustomers. The McKinsey analysis described above concisely summarized those distinctions.\n\nPX09010-004.\n\n\n\n                                                48\n\f        For starters, national customers, because of their dispersed geographic presence, often\n\n require a broadliner to meet their foodservice needs in more than one region. As a result, the\n\nnumber of distribution centers in a broadliner's network is often an important factor for such\n\n customers. In sharp contrast, according to Sysco, \"all, or almost all,\" of its \"local contract\n\ncustomers\" are served by only one distribution center. PX01400-001.\n\n        The Defendants' ordinary course documents highlighted their comprehensive distribution\n\nnetworks as a competitive advantage for serving national customers. See, e.g., PX03000-014 (USF\n\npresentation touting its \"[a]bility to leverage our national scale to cost effectively service\n\ncustomers nationally\"); PX00247-001-002 (USF email communication t o - describing\n\nthe \"US Foods Value Proposition\" as including \"Privately held National Distribution footprint\n\ncompany\"; \"Single IT operating platform nationally\"; and a \"Single Point of Contact\"); PXO 1062-\n\n005 (Sysco presentation to Aramark highlighting that Sysco' s \"national footprint, strong service\n\napproach and our breadth of product offerings is what differentiates us from our competition\").\n\nAs USF's David Schreibman acknowledged during the evidentiary hearing, \"US Foods['] leading\n\nnational market position is due to US Foods['] geographic presence that includes 62 distribution\n\ncenters across the United States.\" Hr'g Tr. 1520-21. He also acknowledged that Sysco was the\n\nonly company with greater scale than USF. Id. at 1522.\n\n       In addition to multi-regional distribution capabilities, national customers generally demand\n\na set margin contract that applies across multiple locations. As PFG' s George Holm testified, a\n\nsingle contract enables customers to simplify contract administration and to reduce administrative\n\ncosts. Id. at 600-02. Additionally, national customers often use RFPs and/or bilateral negotiations\n\nto award broadline foodservice distribution contracts. Id. at 1595-97. In sharp contrast, pricing\n\nfor local or \"street\" customers, according to Sysco, \"[is] ultimately the result of individual\n\n\n\n                                                49\n\f negotiations between the customer and [broad.liner]\" and \"can vary on a weekly and even daily\n\n basis.\" PX06057-032.\n\n        National customers also seek a single technology platform for handling their purchases.\n\n Consolidating purchasing through a single ordering platform creates efficiencies and cost savings,\n\n particularly as it relates to managing direct contracts with manufacturers and administering price\n\n changes. The importance of this feature is evidenced by DMA's development of a single ordering\n\nplatform that enables customers to purchase from its members.          Indeed, DMA promotes its\n\ntechnology platform as superior to Sysco's and USF's. PX00565-006 at 23-24. If national\n\ncustomers had not demanded such a feature, DMA would not have developed it.\n\n        Finally, product consistency is a factor for some national customers, particularly for those\n\nwho wish-to-purchase private label products. See PX09010-004 (McKinsey report identifying as\n\na \"Customer requirement[]\" for \"National\" customers \"consistency of service, pricing, and\n\nproducts across multiple Markets\"). Large customers can achieve a high degree of product\n\nconsistency through direct contracting with product manufacturers or by purchasing proprietary\n\nbrands stocked by Defendants. DX-01359 at 73 (Dr. Bresnahan report observing that \"one way\n\ncustomers that value consistency achieve it is through direct negotiation with manufacturers to\n\ncreate propriety products\" and that \"[c]ustomers can also rely on national brands to ensure\n\nconsistency\"). However, because private label goods offer a strong value benefit, if a national\n\ncustomer wishes to purchase such goods and have them available across all of its locations, it can\n\ndo so most efficiently through a broad.liner with national geographic scope. See Hr'g Tr. 600\n\n(George Holm of PFG stating that one reason national customers prefer to contract with Sysco or\n\nUSF is that \"[w]here they have a preference for a private brand, []it is the same product [across]\n\ntheir system\").\n\n\n\n                                                50\n\f                       c,     Defendants' Operations\n\n        Both Sysco and USF operate dedicated sales groups from their national headquarters that\n\n are responsible for negotiating and managing contracts with customers who use multiple\n\n distribution centers. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 572-74 (holding that centralized station security\n\nservices operated on a national level is a relevant product market). Sysco refers to these customers\n\nas \"corporate multi-unit customers,\" or CMUs. USF refers to them as \"national sales customers.\"\n\nAccording to USF's Senior Vice President for National Sales, Tom Lynch, each national customer\n\nin his group has a single USF representative who is responsible for that customer. The largest\n\ncustomers are assigned a full-time dedicated employee to manage the account. PX00517-014-015\n\nat 56-58.\n\n                       d.     SSNIP Test\n\n        Contraiy to what Defendants contend, Dr. Israel did perform a SSNIP test to determine\n\nwhether there is a separate product market for national customers. That SSNIP test was performed\n\nas an element of the SSNIP test that Dr. Israel used to assess whether broadline distribution was a\n\nrelevant product market.    As Dr. Israel testified, he applied to national customers the same\n\n10 percent gross margin that he used to calculate the aggregate diversion ratio for all customers.\n\nHr'g Tr. 1005 (stating that he used a 10 percent gross margin \"to both local and national\n\ncustomers\"). He derived the actual diversion for national customers based on the RFP/bidding\n\ndata provided by the defendant companies. Id. at 1009 (describing the \"RFP/bidding data\" as\n\n\"really national [customer] data\"). Using the same methods discussed above, Dr. Israel calculated\n\n\n\nUSF' s national customers to be !pf§iltfJ:'I. In other words, o v e r - of the time (based\n\non potential revenue from sales opportunities), when Sysco or USF lost a bid opportunity for a\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\f national customer, it was to another broadliner. Because these percentages were greater than the\n\n aggregate diversion ratio of 50 percent, Dr. Israel concluded that broadline service to national\n\n customers was a relevant market. In other words, Dr. Israel found that only 50 percent of national\n\n broadline customers would need to remain within the broadline market to make a price increase\n\n profitable, while the actual percentage of national customers who would remain within the\n\n broadline market (by switching to another broadliner) was greater than 50 percent. Dr. Israel's\n\n calculations, therefore, indicated that broadline distribution to national customers was the relevant\n\n product market.\n\n          The court already has expressed its reservations about relying on the RFP/bidding data to\n\n precisely calculate the aggregate diversion ratio. But, as before, the court finds that the ultimate\n\n conclusion of the SSNIP test-that broadline foodservice to national customers is a relevant\n\n product market-is supported by the weight of the evidence.                       Numerous national customer\n\n witnesses testified that other channels of distribution were not adequate substitutes for broadline\n\n distribution. 21 Although Defendants have shown that some national customers who were served\n\n by broadliners are now served by systems or systems-like distributors-most notably, Subway and\n\nFive Guys-those are the exceptions. Subway and Five Guys, because of their limited menus, are\n\n more amenable to substituting to a systems model. The same simply cannot be said of other large\n\nnational customers, like GPOs, foodservice management companies, and hospitality chains, which\n\nrely heavily on broadliners.\n\n\n21\n   See Hr'g Tr. 143-145 (Christine Szrom, fact witness for U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, explaining that she is\nnot familiar with systems distribution and could \"absolutely not\" use a cash-and-carry distributors); Hr' g Tr. 214-17\n(James Thompson, Head of Procurement for Interstate Hotels and Resorts, stating that \"it would be very difficult if\nnot impossible\" to operate Interstate's foodservice distribution without a broadliner and that specialty is not a\nsubstitute for broadline distribution); PJ<llll-002 (Joan Ralph, Group Vice President at Premier, Inc., saying that\n\" [e] ven if we choose one day to contract with systems distributors, specialty distributors, or cash and carry stores,\neach would be as an additional, distinct service for our members who may ne_e~ck, last-minute item or two; none\n~ce or serve as a substitute for broadline distribution services\"); P~-002 ~\n- - , noting t h a t - cannot contract with a systems distributor or use other f~\n\n                                                          52\n\f                         e,      Defendants' arguments against a national customer market\n\n          Asserting that there is no separate product market for national broadline customers,\n\nDefendants first argue that the national-local distinction is \"arbitrary\" because it is based on\n\nnothing more than customer preference about account management.              Defendants' executives\n\ntestified that Sysco's CMU customers and USF's national customers are so designated, not because\n\nof any particular characteristic or group of characteristics, but purely because the customer prefers\n\nto have its account managed by the headquarters sales team, instead of by its local distribution\n\ncenter.     The FTC's and Dr. Israel's reliance on the companies' administrative designation,\n\nDefendants argue, leads to arbitrary classifications. For example, some of Defendants' customers\n\nwho use a small number of distribution centers are counted by the FTC as \"national\" customers.\n\nAs Dr. Hausman demonstrated, 37 percent of Sysco's CMU customers use five or fewer\n\ndistribution centers and 55 percent use ten or fewer. And, for USF, 51 percent of their national\n\ncustomers use five or fewer distribution centers and 67 percent use ten or fewer. Hr' g Tr. 1976.\n\nAdditionally, similarly situated customers-in terms of size, number of distribution centers,\n\nrevenues, etc.-are sometimes treated differently. One customer may be identified as national and\n\nanother as local, simply because one prefers to be managed from headquarters and the other from\n\nthe local distribution center.\n\n          Defendants are correct that their \"national\" customer lists are over-inclusive-not every\n\ncustomer on those lists has multi-regional distribution needs. And they are also correct that the\n\nFTC could have more accurately defined a class of \"national\" customers by testing each candidate\n\nnational customer against specific \"national\" criteria, such as the number of distribution centers\n\nused. But, ultimately, for the purpose of defining a product market, the court finds that the parties'\n\n\n\n\n                                                 53\n\f\"national\" customer designation is a useful proxy for customers requiring geographically dispersed\n\ndistribution and attendant services.\n\n        As the graphic below prepared by Dr. Israel shows, if the merger were to occur, a\n\nsignificant proportion of the combined company's national customer revenues would come from\n\ncustomers who use a large number of distribution centers. PX09375-077, Figure 3. National\n\ncustomers using more than 3 5 distribution centers would account   forl percent of a merged Sysco-\nUSF' s revenue; national customers using more than 24 distribution centers would account for     I\npercent of revenue; and national customers using at least 10 distribution centers would account for\n\nIIpercent of revenue. Those figures demonstrate that Defendants' national-customer designations\ncapture those key customers (based on revenues) who use a large number of distribution centers.\n\nThe \"national\" designation includes, among others, the largest GPOs, like Premier, Novation, and\n\nMedAssets, each of whom uses over      I   distribution centers; the largest foodservice management\n\ncompanies, like Sodexo, Aramark, and Compass, each of whom uses more than           I   distribution\n\ncenters; the largest hotel management company, Hilton, which uses      I   distribution centers; and\n\nthe second largest government customer, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which uses      I\ndistribution centers (the largest is the U.S. Department of Defense, which uses     I   distribution\n\ncenters). PX09375-076, Table 5. Thus, for these customers, the label \"national\" is not merely\n\nadministrative; it accurately reflects this high revenue-generating group's actual needs. The fact\n\n\n\n\n                                                 54\n\f that some smaller customers are included among the Defendants' ·'national'' designations does not\n\nmean that the desig;1atio11 lacks evidentia1y value for defining a market for national customers.\n\n                                              Figure 3\n              SyM:o and l'SF 2013 Re\\eUUt'S   IJ,v l'\\uml>er ufDistriuution Centen rwd\n\n\n\n\n       Next, Defendants assert that defining a pnce discrimination market around national\n\ncustomers is untenable because the FTC failed to show that so-called national customers shared\n\nany objectively observable characteristics that would enable t11e combined company to price\n\ndiscriminate against that group. See Merger Guidelines § 3 (stating that \"differential pricing\" is\n\nan essential element of price discrimination, which \"may involve\" offering different pricing to\n\ndifferent types of customers \"based on observable characteristics\"), In other worcls, they argue\n\nthat this grouping of customers is so heterogeneous that there is no collllllon, identifiable\n\n\n\n\n                                                55\n\f characteristic that could serve as a proxy for determining which customers in the broadline market\n\n have inelastic demand.\n\n        Defendants are undoubtedly correct that, even among their largest customers, there is great\n\n variety in the customers' servicing needs and requirements. But price discrimination can occur\n\n even when customers do not have common observable characteristics. As the Merger Guidelines\n\n state, markets for targeted customers may exist \"when prices are individually negotiated and\n\n suppliers have information about customers that would allow a hypothetical monopolist to identify\n\ncustomers that are likely to pay ahigher price forthe relevant product.\" Merger Guidelines§ 4.1.4;\n\nsee also Carl Shapiro, The 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines: From Hedgehog to Fox in Forty\n\nYears, 77 Antitrust L.J. 49, 93 (2010) (observing that, in markets for intermediate goods and\n\nservices, \"prices typically are negotiated and price discrimination is common\").\n\n        Here, the evidence is clear that Defendants engage in individual negotiations with their\n\nnational customers and possess substantial information about them.            Indeed, the fact that\n\nDefendants employ substantially more sales representatives than other broadliners, PX093 50-218,\n\nTable 30, and assign full-time dedicated employees to some of their largest customers is indicative\n\nof the \"know-your-customer\" philosophies of both firms. Defendants, therefore, already have\n\nsubstantial customer information that would allow them to predict which of their customers have\n\ninelastic demand and which do not. Price discrimination can occur in such a marketplace, even if\n\nthe targeted customers do not share specific identifiable traits.\n\n       Finally, Defendants contend that a product market of targeted national customers does not\n\ncomport with business realities. This argument has two main elements. First, they assert that,\n\ncontrary to what the FTC contends, Compl.    iii! 5, 42, national customers do not require a broadline\nfoodservice distributor that is national in scope. Rather, they argue, even at current prices, many\n\n\n\n                                                 56\n\flarge customers spread their distribution needs over multiple regional suppliers. For instance,\n\nDefendants cite GPOs, l i k e - · - ' Amerinet and large government agencies. like\n\nthe Defonse Logistics Agency, as using a regional contracting approach. Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 15.\n\nThey also refer to one of the largest foodservice management companies, Sodexo. which splits its\n\ndistribution into   I   regions. Id. A. nd. then there is Subway and Five Guys. two large chain\n\nrestaurants that have regionalized and purchase from multiple suppliers. Id. at 15-16. Because\n\nthese tyves of customers can regionalize or credibly threaten to regionalize. Defendants argue, the\n\nmerged company would not be able to discriminate against them on price.\n\n        But Defendants' argument founders when faced with the actual purchasing habits of the\n\nindustry's largest customers. The evidence shows that the bulk of the broadline purchasing done\n\nby most geographically dispersed breadline customers is still done through Sysco and USF.\n\nOf Avendra's members' breadline spend,          I     percent is witl1 Sysco and USF.

Sodexo, Aramark, Compass, and Centerplate,\n\nrespectively, spend     I   percent,   I   percent,   I    percent, and   I    percent of their broa<lline\n\nfoodservice distribution dollars with Sysco and USF. PFF at 113-16: FTC Closing Arg. Slides at\n\n35. The story is similar for large hospitality customers. Two of tl1e largest, Hilton and Interstate,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      57\n\f allocate   I   percent and   I   percent of their broadline spend, respectively, to the two companies.\n\n PFF at 114, 116; FTC Closing Arg. Slides at 35. Even the Defense Logistics Agency, which\n\n contracts regionally, dedicates     I   percent of its broadline spend to Sysco and USF. PFF at 116;\n\n FTC Closing Arg. Slides at 35.\n\n        The court infers from this evidence that geographically dispersed customers view Sysco\n\n and USF as having significant comparative advantages over regional distributors, particularly\n\n because of their far-reaching distribution networks. Though some customers have spread their\n\n business over multiple broadliners, a significant portion (as measured by total revenues) have not.\n\n Indeed, PFG's George Holm observed that the \"clear trend amongst national broadline customers\n\nis to move toward a single nationwide provider.\" Hr'g Tr. 598 (emphasis added); PX09081-002\n\n(letter from PFG's counsel to FTC, dated November 14, 2014, stating the same). See Brown Shoe,\n\n370 U.S. at 332 (footnote omitted) (\"Another important factor to consider is the trend toward\n\nconcentration in the industry.\"). Mr. Holm further admitted that either Sysco or USF essentially\n\nwins every RFP issued by a national customer. Hr' g Tr. 598-99. And PFG acknowledged by letter\n\nto the FTC that, even as the country's third-largest broadliner, \"PFG has difficulty competing for\n\nnational broadline accounts because it does not have a nationwide footprint of broadline\n\ndistribution centers.\" PX09081-001. Other large regional broadliners have said the same about\n\ntheir own businesses models. 23 Defendants' contention-that a product market defined around\n\nnational customers does not comport with business reality because such customers have\n\nregionalized or can regionalize-is thus belied by the record evidence.\n\n\n\n\n23\n  See, e.g., PX00415-004 (Reinhart); PX00416-003 (Merchants); PX00434-003-004 (Labatt); PX00438-002-003\n(Cash-Wa); PX00443-005 (Ben E. Keith); PX00449-003 (Jacmar); PX00451-005 (Services Group of America);\nPX00458-004 (Nicholas & Co.); PX00460-002-003 (Shamrock); PX00529-047-048 at 188-89 (Gordon).\n\n                                                     58\n\f        Second, Defendants argue that margin data shows that, as a merged entity, they would not\n\nbe able to price discriminate against national customers.        Dr. Hausman demonstrated that\n\nDefendants' margin on sales to customers who use fewer distribution centers is actually higher\n\nthan their margin on sales to those who use more. DX-01355 at 58-61. Defendants contend that\n\nunder the FTC's theory, they presently have a duopoly as to national customers, yet they do not\n\nearn duopoly profits on that customer class. Defendants thus maintain that, just as they cannot\n\ntoday price discriminate to earn duopoly profits, they would not be able to price discriminate after\n\nthe merger to earn monopoly profits.\n\n        Defendants' argument, however, is unconvincing. Defendants' present inability to earn\n\nduopoly profits on national customers is probably because large customers can keep prices down\n\nby leveraging the defendant companies against one another. As the Cleveland Research Company\n\nobserved: \"Based on our research, we believe both Sysco and US Foods have priced each other\n\ndown competing for larger national/regional contract accounts over the last several years.\"\n\nPX09332-004. The ability of large buyers to keep prices down, functioning as what is known in\n\nantitrust literature as \"power buyers,'' see Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 58-59; Merger\n\nGuidelines § 8, depends on the alternatives these large buyers have available to them, see Shapiro,\n\nsupra, at 95; Areeda & Hovenkamp 3d ed.,     supra,~   943a. If a merger reduces alternatives, the\n\npower buyers' ability to constrain price and avoid price discrimination can be correspondingly\n\ndiminished. See Merger Guidelines § 8 (\"Normally, a merger that eliminates a supplier whose\n\npresence contributed significantly to a buyer's negotiating leverage will harm that buyer.\"). Thus,\n\nthe fact that Defendants are currently unable to price discriminate against national customers does\n\nnot mean that they would be unable to do so as a merged firm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                59\n\f        C.      Product Market Summary\n\n        Having considered and weighed the parties' arguments and evidence, the court concludes\n\nthat the FTC has carried its burden of showing that, for purposes of merger analysis, (i) broadline\n\nfoodservice distribution is a relevant product market, and (ii) broadline foodservice distribution to\n\nnational customers is also a relevant product market.\n\n        D.     Relevant Geographic Market\n\n        The court now turns to the second part of defining the relevant market, which involves\n\ndetermining the relevant geographic market. The Supreme Court has stated that, for Section 7 of\n\nthe Clayton Act, the relevant geographic market is \"the area in which the goods or services at issue\n\nare marketed to a significant degree by the acquired firm.\" Marine Bancorp., 418 U.S. at 620-21.\n\nStated differently, \"[t]he proper question to be asked ... [is] where, within the area of competitive\n\noverlap, the effect of the merger on competition will be direct and immediate.\" Phi/a. Nat. Bank,\n\n374 U.S. at 357; see also Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 49 (citation omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (stating that the relevant geographic market is \"the area to which\n\nconsumers can practically turn for alternative sources of the product and in which the antitrust\n\ndefendants face competition\"). Like the product market, the geographic market must \"correspond\n\nto the commercial realities of the industry and be economically significant.\" Brown Shoe, 370\n\nU.S. at 336-37 (footnote omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that an \"element of 'fuzziness would seem inherent in any attempt to delineate the\n\nrelevant geographical market,\"' and therefore \"such markets need not-indeed cannot-be defined\n\nwith scientific precision.\" Conn. Nat. Bank, 418 U.S. at 669 (quoting Phi/a. Nat 'l Bank, 374 U.S.\n\nat 360 n.37). That said, the relevant geographic market \"must be sufficiently defined so that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                60\n\f [c]ourt understands in which part of the country competition is threatened.\" Cardinal Health,\n\n 12 F. Supp. 2d at 49.\n\n        The FTC contends that there are two relevant geographic markets in this case. For national\n\nbroadline customers, the relevant geographic market is nationwide. For local broadline customers,\n\nthe relevant geographic markets are localized around Defendants' distribution centers.\n\n        With regard to national customers, for essentially the same reasons that the FTC asserts\n\nthat there is a product market for broadline distribution to national customers, the FTC asserts that\n\nthe geographic market for those customers is nationwide.           The FTC relies on the fact that\n\nDefendants plan on a national level and have \"national account\" teams dedicated to national\n\ncustomers; their contractual pricing and service terms with national customers apply across\n\nregions; and their competition for national customers is largely other broadliners with nationwide\n\ncoverage.\n\n        As for local customers, as discussed in more detail below, the FTC's local geographic\n\nmarkets were constructed by Dr. Israel and are premised on customers' proximity to Defendants'\n\ndistribution centers. The basic idea is that, for local customers, distance to a distribution center is\n\na key service factor and, for Defendants, distance traveled from a distribution center to make\n\ndeliveries is a critical cost component.     The FTC alleges that the merger threatens to harm\n\ncompetition in 32 local geographic markets where Sysco and USF together currently have\n\ndominant market shares. Compl.     ~   60.\n\n       Defendants dispute that there is a nationwide geographic market for the same reasons that\n\nthey contend that there is no national customer product market. As for the local geographic\n\nmarkets, Defendants aggressively challenge the methodology that Dr. Israel used in defining local\n\nmarkets. Their primary criticism is that the geographic areas are drawn so narrowly that they\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f exclude actual competition from the relevant market. This results, they contend, in local market\n\n concentrations that artificially inflate Defendants' market shares.\n\n                l.      National Market\n\n        Although the physical act of delivering food products occurs locally, for national customers\n\nthe relevant geographic area for competitive alternatives is nationwide, primarily because of their\n\ngeographically dispersed footprint.     Defendants compete within this market by touting their\n\nnationwide distribution capabilities to these customers; bidding against other broadliners with\n\nmulti-regional capabilities (which is to say, against each other and the regional cooperatives);\n\ncoordinating the marketing, negotiating, and managing of these customers through their \"national\n\naccount\" teams; and entering with these customers into a single contract whose terms, including\n\npricing, apply across regions. For these reasons, the court finds that the relevant geographic market\n\nfor broadline foodservice to national customers is nationwide. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 575-76\n\n(finding a national geographic market where central station services \"operated on a national level,''\n\nand there was \"national planning,\" a nationwide schedule of prices, and nationwide contracting\n\nfor multi-state businesses); Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 50 (finding a national geographic\n\nmarket where evidence showed that \"GPOs negotiate contracts with several wholesalers, making\n\nthe same prices available throughout the country to all of their members-local, regional, or\n\nnational\").\n\n               2.      Local Markets\n\n       Defining the local geographic market presents a far greater challenge. Not surprisingly,\n\nthere is no industry standard for delineating the area that makes up a local geographic market for\n\nbroadline distribution. Each local market has its own unique attributes. Customer composition\n\nand concentration differs across markets; so does the demand for products, with SKU variations\n\n\n\n                                                 62\n\f reflecting local tastes and palettes. Average driving distances for foodservice distributors vary\n\n depending on the density of the area, with longer hauls more common in rural parts of the country\n\nand shorter trips more prevalent in urban areas. And, of course, the competitors vary from market\n\nto market.\n\n        The FTC tasked Dr. Israel with defining the local geographic markets. He constructed\n\nthem as follows. In his first step, Dr. Israel drew circles around the location of each Sysco and\n\nUSF distribution center. To determine the size of each circle, Dr. Israel used a radius, referred to\n\nas the \"draw distance,\" that, on average, captured 75 percent of the distribution center's sales to\n\nlocal customers. The length of each distribution center's 75 percent draw radius differed. For\n\nexample, the 75 percent draw distance around Sysco's Billings, Montana, facility was 262 miles,\n\nwhereas the 75 percent draw distance around Sysco's Jersey City, New Jersey, facility was only\n\n24 miles. PX09350-221-224, Table 38. What that means is Sysco drives over 200 miles further\n\nto capture 75 percent of its local sales in Billings than it does in Jersey City. That disparity makes\n\nsense, as more populated areas correspond to higher customer concentrations and shorter delivery\n\ndistances.\n\n       In his second step, Dr. Israel identified each company's local customers that fell within an\n\narea of intersection between the draw circle around the Sysco distribution center and the draw\n\ncircle around the USF distribution center. This area of intersection was termed the \"overlap area.\"\n\nThese \"overlap customers,\" according to Dr. Israel, were the customers most likely to suffer harm\n\nfrom the merger, because these were the customers who would be left with one less alternative\n\nsupplier after the merger. Exhibit 40 from Dr. Bresnahan's report, which is reproduced below,\n\nshows Dr. Israel's methodology in the Omaha, Nebraska, area. The blue-dotted circle corresponds\n\n\n\n\n                                                 63\n\f to Sysco's 75 percent draw area, and the green-dotted circle corresponds to USF's. The dark gray\n\n area corresponds to the \"overlap customers.\" DX-01359, Ex. 40.\n\n\n                                                   EXHIBIT 40\n              OISTRlBUTION CENTERS LOCATED NEAR THE FTC'S CONTESTED LOCAL AREAS\n                                   OMAHA, NE/COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                         @   MaJO~      tkuad\\r.e.r\n                                        {fl' US Fc~?j-s BrnadlF1e                        0   MaJf..i[   6ruadlaHJ~' w~~i; Sa~es   f}a:a\n                                      'W>W   l5% USF Draw l\\r~a \\'DQ);t rrnt~ radiu!>J\n\n\n\n\n       In his third step, Dr. Israel identified the broadline distributors who could compete for the\n\ncustomers in the overlap area. To do this, Dr. Israel drew circles around each overlap customer\n\nusing the 75 percent draw radius. This created a larger circle that moved the outer boundaries of\n\nthe overlap area by the same radius as the 75 percent draw area, which is represented by the light\n\ngray area in Exhibit 40 above. According to Dr. Israel's analysis, the light gray area is the area to\n\nwhich customers can practically tum for alternative sources of broadline distribution. All of the\n                                                         64\n\f competitors located within the light gray area were factored into Dr. Israel's local market share\n\ncomputations.\n\n        Defendants attack Dr. Israel's \"circle drawing exercise\" as \"arbitrary\" and not reflective of\n\nindustry realities. Defs.' Opp'n Br. at 27. Specifically, they assert that Dr. Israel's methodology\n\nis flawed because it assumes that competitors will drive no greater distance than Sysco's or USF's\n\n75 percent draw radius to serve customers. Defendants point to competitor declarations and\n\ntestimony showing that in many of the 32 local markets in which the FTC claims Defendants have\n\na dominant market share, competitors are willing to, and do, drive distances greater than the\n\n75 percent draw radius to compete for and deliver to customers.\n\n        Notwithstanding this criticism, the court finds that there is nothing inherently \"arbitrary\"\n\nabout Dr. Israel's methodology in defining the local markets. To the contrary, given the absence\n\nof an industry standard for defining a local market, Dr. Israel's methodology provides a practical\n\napproach and solution to an otherwise thorny problem. Dr. Israel's premise in defining these\n\nmarkets-that driving distance matters-is amply supported by the record and common sense.\n\nCustomers who are farther away from a distribution center cost more to service. Longer distances\n\ncorrespond to, among other things, higher gas usage, more labor hours, and increased wear and\n\ntear on trucks. Given that the geographic market need not be defined by \"metes and bounds,\"\n\nConn. Nat 'l Bank, 418 U.S. at 669 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\nDr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology identifies \"the area of competitive overlap, [where] the\n\neffect of the merger on competition will be direct and immediate,\" Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at\n\n357. See also Conn. Nat'l Bank, 418 U.S. at 670 n.9 (remanding to the district court to define the\n\nlocal market and observing that the \"federal bank regulatory agencies define a bank's service area\n\nas the geographic area from which the bank derives 75% of its deposits\"). The court therefore\n\n\n\n                                                65\n\f concludes that the relevant local geographic markets are the areas of overlap resulting from\n\n Dr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology.\n\n        Ultimately, what really troubles Defendants about Dr. Israel's \"circle drawing exercise\" is\n\nnot the resulting geographic areas, but what those areas mean for calculating Defendants' local\n\nmarket shares. The court considers those arguments in the next section.\n\nII.     THE PROBABLE EFFECTS ON COMPETITION\n\n        Having concluded that the FTC has carried its burden of establishing a relevant market-\n\nboth a nationwide market for broadline foodservice to national customers and various local\n\nmarkets for broadline foodservice to local customers-the court turns next to \"the likely effects of\n\nthe proposed [merger] on competition within [those] market[s].\" SwedishMatch, 131 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 166. As the Court of Appeals explained in Heinz, the government \"must show that the merger\n\nwould produce 'a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market, and [would]\n\nresult[ ] in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market.\"' 246 F.3d at 715\n\n(quoting Phi/a.

Concentration in the National Broadline Customer Market\n\n               1.      Dr. Israel's National Broadline Customer Market Shares Calculations\n\n        In some cases the merging parties' market shares and post-merger HHis are seemingly\n\nuncontroversial. See, e.g., Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1081-82; H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 71-\n\n72. Not so here. Because there are no industl)'-recognized market shares for national broadline\n\ncustomers, the FTC tasked Dr. Israel with calculating the market shares and the HHis.           Not\n\nsurprisingly, Defendants vigorously contested his methodology and conclusions.\n\n       Dr. Israel calculated Defendants' national customer shares as follows. As his first step, he\n\nidentified Defendants' individual sales to national broadline customers, i.e., the numerator for the\n\nmarket share calculation. Those sales figures came directly from the parties' \"national\" customer\n\ndesignations: for Sysco, its sales to CMU customers, and for USF, its sales to national customers.\n\n       Next, Dr. Israel determined the total sales by all broadline distributors to national\n\ncustomers, i.e., the denominator for the national share calculation. Again, because there is no\n\n\n\n                                                67\n\f industry-recognized figure for such sales, Dr. Israel estimated them. He did so in two ways. First,\n\n he aggregated the national sales of the three principal competitors for national customers-Sysco,\n\n USF, and DMA-and added in another share equal to DMA's.                  This total comprised the\n\n denominator for his \"baseline\" shares calculation. PX09350-074. The addition of another DMA-\n\n sized share to the denominator was premised on his observation from the RFP/bidding data that\n\nthe size of sales to national customers by all broadliners other than Sysco, USF, and DMA was\n\nabout the same as DMA's.\n\n        Dr. Israel also used a second method to calculate the total sales to national customers. He\n\naggregated the national sales reported by the largest 16 broadliners, including DMA and MUG, in\n\nresponse to the FTC's civil investigative demands. This data is referred to as CID data. Dr. Israel\n\nran several \"sensitivities\" on this sum, adding in sales to account for variations in CID responses\n\n(e.g., some distributors did not segregate \"national\" from total sales). Dr. Israel also aggregated\n\nthe national sales of Sysco, USF, DMA, and MUG, plus an estimate of national sales for all other\n\nresponding distributors based on the assumption that each distributor's national-local sales ratio\n\nwas the same as Defendants' ratio.      Dr. Israel's various approaches yielded a total national\n\nbroadline sales estimate of $28 to $30 billion. Hr'g Tr. 1177-78; see also PX09060-006 (PFG\n\nbusiness plan estimating the size of the national customer market to be approximately $20 billion).\n\n       As his last step, Dr. Israel adjusted his market shares to account for the divestiture to PFG.\n\nThe chart below reflects Dr. Israel's post-merger, post-divestiture market share and HHI\n\ncalculations. For his \"baseline\" calculation, Dr. Israel determined that the parties' post-merger\n\nnational broadline customer market share would be 71 percent with an HHI increase of nearly\n\n2,000 points. His CID data-based calculations, shown as (i) through (vi) in the chart, also yielded\n\nhigh post-merger shares and significantly increased HHis.          Dr. Israel's most conservative\n\n\n\n                                                68\n\f approach, in which he assumed that the top 16 broadliners had national to local sales ratios that\n\n were equal to Defendants' ratio of such shares-( iv) in the chart below-resulted in a post-merger\n\nmarket share of 59 percent and an Hill increase of 1,500 points.

Defendants' Arguments\n\n          Defendants raise a host of objections to the reliability of Dr. Israel's methodology and\n\ncalculations. They contend that his use of their \"national\" sales in the numerator was arbitrary\n\nbecause, as discussed above, not all of Defendants' \"national\" sales are to customers with a multi-\n\nregional footprint. The inclusion of those sales, they contend, overstated Defendants' national\n\nmarket share. They also argue that Dr. Israel's numerator included some sales to systems-like\n\ncustomers, such as to Five Guys, but his denominator excluded competitors' systems sales. This\n\nasymmetry, they assert, also resulted in an overstatement of Defendants' share. They further\n\ncontend that the denominator used in Dr. Israel's \"baseline\" calculation is unreliable because it\n\nrelies on the flawed RFP/bidding data set. And, finally, they argue that the denominator in the\n\nCID data calculation excludes over $30 billion in sales-though the source of this number is\n\n\n\n                                                       69\n\f unclear. 24 They contend that these errors in developing the numerator resulted in biased market\n\n share calculations.\n\n          None of these arguments ultimately persuade the court that Dr. Israel's methodology or his\n\n market shares and HHI calculations are unreliable. The FTC need not present market shares and\n\n HHI estimates with the precision of a NASA scientist. The \"closest available approximation\"\n\n often will do. PPG, 798 F.2d at 1505 (citation omitted); see also H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n 72 (stating that a \"reliable, reasonable, close approximation of relevant market share data is\n\n sufficient\"). Indeed, in PPG, the FTC presented, and the Court of Appeals accepted, share\n\n calculations for \"every market the evidence suggests is remotely possible,\" which \"yield[ ed]\n\n results of similar magnitudes in market concentration.\" 798 F.2d at 1506. Similarly, Dr. Israel\n\nran multiple variants of his market shares and concentration analysis, using two different data sets\n\nand modifying one of these data sets, the CID data, in six different ways. Most convincing to the\n\ncourt was Dr. Israel's final method of calculating shares using the CID data, which assumed that\n\nall 16 of the top broadliners had the same national-local sales ratio as Defendants did. That\n\napproach yielded a low-end market share of 59 percent and an HHI increase of 1,500 points-\n\nalmost three times the 510 points that the Court of Appeals in Heinz found created a presumption\n\nof harm by a \"wide margin.\" 246 F.3d at 716. This variation almost certainly underestimated\n\nDefendants' market shares, as smaller broadliners are unlikely to have a ratio of national-local\n\nsales comparable to Defendants' ratio.\n\n         Another reason Defendants' arguments do not sway the court is that other evidence in the\n\nrecord supports Dr. Israel's calculations. As discussed above, the largest customers for broadline\n\n\n\n24\n   \"Dr. Israel acknowledged that he left out $30 billion in systems distribution in the \"sensitivity analysis purporting\nto account for systems sales.\" Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, ECF No. 171at263 (citing\nHr'g Tr. 1259-60).\n\n                                                          70\n\f distribution in the country-healthcare GPOs, foodservice management companies, hospitality\n\n companies, and large government agencies-make the vast majority of their broadline purchases\n\nfrom Defendants. These customers individually spend hundreds of millions of dollars (or more)\n\non broadline distribution-totaling approximately half of the national broadline market (based on\n\nDr. Israel's calculation of a total market of $28 to $30 billion). See FTC Closing Arg. Slides at\n\n3 5. If the largest customers are presently spending between 60 to 100 percent of their total food\n\nbudget with Defendants, id., then Dr. Israel's low-bound, post-merger combined market share of\n\n59 percent is consistent with market realities.\n\n        In addition, the only independent market share analysis of the broadline industry identified\n\nby the parties corroborates Dr. Israel's conclusions. The foodservice industry research firm\n\nTechnomic collected 2014 sales data from the country's 43 largest broadliners. DX02016. Taken\n\ntogether, Technomic estimated total broadline sales to be $125 billion.        Of that total, Sysco\n\naccounted for $35.7 billion and USF $23 billion, for a combined sum of $58.7 billion-nearly\n\n47 percent of U.S. sales. See id.; see also PX09045-015 (PFG presentation to FTC stating that\n\n\"[t]he two largest broadliners (Sysco and US Foods) accounted for 51 % of all broadline sales in\n\n2010,\" based on a study by Hale Group, \"Focus on Foodservice Distribution,\" dated April 11,\n\n2013); PX09045-014 (PFG presentation to FTC highlighting a 2011 Technomic study showing\n\nthat Sysco and USF had a combined market share of 58 percent among the top 10 broadline food\n\ndistributors).\n\n        Technomic's 47 percent combined market share estimate for total broadline sales is\n\nconsistent with Dr. Israel's low-end, post-divestiture estimate of 59 percent for national broadline\n\nsales. The Technomic data did not segregate national and local broadline customers. However,\n\nbecause the largest customers buy disproportionately from Sysco and USF, it stands to reason that\n\n\n\n                                                  71\n\f the companies' combined market share for national customers would be greater than 47 percent,\n\n as Dr. Israel found. Even a combined market share of 47 percent (admittedly, a pre-divestiture\n\n number) can give rise to a presumption of harm. See Phila. Nat 'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 364 (\"Without\n\n attempting to specify the smallest market share which would still be considered to threaten undue\n\n concentration, we are clear that 30% presents that threat.\").\n\n                3.           The Court's Finding as to National Broadline Customer Market Shares\n\n        The court thus finds that the FTC has shown, through Dr. Israel's testimony and other\n\nevidence, that a merger of Sysco and USF will result in a significant increase in market\n\nconcentration in the market for national broadline customers. The FTC therefore has established\n\na rebuttable presumption that the merger will substantially lessen competition in the market for\n\nnational broadline distribution.\n\n        B.      Concentration in the Local Markets\n\n                !.          Dr. Israel's Local Broadline Customer Market Shares Calculations\n\n        In addition to the market for national customers, the FTC also contends that the merged\n\nfirm would create highly concentrated local markets for broadline foodservice distribution. To be\n\nprecise, the FTC asserts that, in 32 different local markets, the merger between Sysco and USF\n\nwould result in dramatic increases in IIlils, thereby substantially lessening the competition in those\n\nmarkets. Compl.      ~   60, App. A. The FTC also maintains that the divestiture to PFG will not resolve\n\nDefendants' post-merger local market dominance.\n\n       As with the market for national customers, there is no industry study oflocal market shares.\n\nSee PX09045-019 (\"PFG is not aware of any systematic industry market share data\"). The FTC\n\nagain relied on Dr. Israel for those numbers.             His starting point for calculating local share\n\npercentages was his 75 percent draw area methodology for defining the local geographic markets.\n\n\n\n                                                     72\n\f See PX09350-058. As already discussed, Dr. Israel first identified the 75 percent overlap area in\n\n each local market and then identified the competitors that could serve those customers by drawing\n\n a circle with a radius equal to the 75 percent draw distance around each overlap customer. Next,\n\n to calculate the overall local market shares, Dr. Israel calculated a customer-specific market share.\n\nThat is, for each customer in the overlap area, he calculated the market shares for the competitors\n\nwho were located within the customer's 75 percent draw distance radius.              Dr. Israel then\n\naggregated each of these customer-specific shares to the local level, using weighted averages\n\nacross all overlap customers. The consequence of this methodology was that, the greater the\n\ncompetitor's distance from the center of the overlap area, the less weight that competitor would\n\nreceive in the overall local market share calculations. Stated differently, because these distant\n\ncompetitors' market shares would only come into the calculation due to customers on the borders\n\nof the overlap area, those competitors' shares would be smaller than the shares of competitors\n\nwhose distribution centers were closer to the middle of the overlap area-namely, Sysco and USF.\n\n        When calculating market shares, Dr. Israel used three different metrics: (i) square footage\n\nof distribution centers; (ii) local broadline sales; and (iii) number of sales representatives.\n\nDr. Israel used the first and third variables as proxies for revenues and as a way to confirm the\n\nmarket share calculations that were based on the second variable, sales revenues. To calculate\n\nshares based on revenues, Dr. Israel used the Defendants' sales data for the numerator. For the\n\ndenominator, he used the sales numbers, where available, for local broadliners. For those local\n\ncompetitors for whom he did not have actual sales data, he estimated the sales revenue based on\n\nthe size of the distribution center. PX09350-134 at n.410. Based on those metrics, in local markets\n\nwith the 20 highest increases in pre-divestiture HHis, Defendants' combined market shares ranged\n\n\n\n\n                                                 73\n\f from 100 percent in San Diego, California, to over 65 percent in multiple markets. The HHI\n\n increases in each of top 20 markets were over 2,000 points. PX09350-135-137.\n\n        Dr. Israel also calculated post-divestiture market concentrations and HHI mcreases.\n\n According to the table below, in Memphis, Tennessee; Omaha, Nebraska; Sacramento, California;\n\n and Charleston, South Carolina, the post-divestiture combined markets shares remain above 80\n\npercent with HHI increases in excess of 4,100, 1,400, 2,900, and 2,900 points, respectively.\n\nPX09350-213, Table 21. In seven other local markets, Dr. Israel calculated the post-divestiture\n\ncombined market shares to be between 57 percent and 76 percent, with HHI increases in each case\n\nin excess of 1,500 points.

Defendants' Arguments\n\n       Defendants attack Dr. Israel's local market share calculations in much the same way they\n\ndid his national market share calculations-by contesting his methodology and inputs. Defendants\n\nassert that Dr. Israel's methodology was premised on the unreliable assumption that no competitor\n\n\n                                               74\n\f would drive a greater distance than Sysco or USF currently does to provide broadline services. In\n\n other words, they criticize Dr. Israel's use of the same draw radius to identify the relevant local\n\n competition as he did to identify the overlap area. As a result, they argue, Dr. Israel's local market\n\n share calculations excluded sales from broadliners who travel greater distances and thereby\n\noverstated Defendants' combined market shares.\n\n        To demonstrate this point, Dr. Bresnahan presented an analysis of the Omaha, Nebraska\n\nmarket. He testified that, according to Dr. Israel's analysis, Defendants had combined sales in\n\nOmaha of $95 million and a combined market share of 90 percent. According to Dr. Bresnahan,\n\nDr. Israel's methodology did not factor in at least -    million in sales by another local distributor,\n\nCash-Wa, whose distribution facility is 129 miles west of Omaha-farther out than the 91-mile\n\n75 percent draw radius that Dr. Israel had used for the area. Dr. Bresnahan based his conclusion\n\non sales data per zip code produced by Cash-Wa, which Dr. Israel had not considered in his\n\nanalysis. According to Dr. Bresnahan, the zip code data showed that in 2013, Cash-Wa made sales\n\nto customers in zip codes within the 75 percent overlap area-at least -        million worth-which\n\nDr. Israel did not account for because of his driving distance assumption. Had these Cash-Wa\n\nsales been taken into account, Defendants' combined market shares and increase in HHis would\n\nhave been lower. As illustrated by his Omaha study, Dr. Bresnahan concluded that Dr. Israel's\n\nlocal market share methodology produced unreliable results.\n\n       Dr. Bresnahan' s Omaha study convincingly demonstrated that Dr. Israel's 7 5 percent draw\n\narea methodology resulted in underreported competitor sales in the Omaha market. But what it\n\ndid not show convincingly was by how much. Dr. Bresnahan's initial expert report stated that\n\nCash-Wa's sales in the overlap area were over -         million. DX01359-139. At the evidentiary\n\nhearing, however, he said that Cash-Wa's sales into that area were \"at least -         million,\" DX-\n\n\n\n                                                 75\n\f 05029 at 42, and he did not explain why that number differed from his report. 25                                More\n\n fundamentally, Dr. Bresnahan's reliance on zip code data had its limits.                       As Dr. Bresnahan\n\n conceded, the zip code data did not differentiate between local and national customers or broadline\n\n and systems customers. Hr'g Tr. 2186. Dr. Israel explained that he did not use the zip code data\n\n for that very reason, as well as the additional reason that he did not have zip code data for all local\n\n market competitors. In addition, Cash-Wa does substantial business selling tobacco products;\n\n however, the zip code data does not segregate those sales. Id. As a result, although the court\n\n agrees with Defendants that Dr. Israel's methodology excluded some local broadline sales in\n\n Omaha, the court cannot reliably determine the extent of the underestimation. And, notably, even\n\n if Dr. Bresnahan's ti million figure consisted entirely of local broadline sales, Defendants would\n still have a high combined local market share of I percent ($95 million/(tl million + $95\n\n million)   =I percent).\n          Ultimately, the court finds that Dr. Israel's specific local market calculations is informative,\n\n but not conclusive evidence, of the merger's potential harm to local broadline customers. As the\n\nOmaha study showed, because Dr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology excluded some\n\ncompetitor sales and because each local market has nuances that cannot be captured by his\n\nmethodology, the court cannot rely conclusively on Dr. Israel's precise local share calculations as\n\na measure of competitive harm.\n\n         The court, however, finds variations on Dr. Israel's 75 percent draw methodology to\n\nprovide persuasive evidence of the merger's impact on local markets. Dr. Israel did more than\n\n\n\n\n25\n   The court infers that the sales figure was reduced, in part, to estimate only Cash-Wa's broadline sales, as opposed\nto all sales. But that reason, if correct, was not made clear on the record. Additionally, in his report, Dr. Bresnahan\nreported over ti   million in sales by another broadliner, Reinhart. However, he made no mention ofReinhart's sales\n~That may be because Reinhart reported that\n~· PX09034-019.\n\n                                                          76\n\f calculate local share percentages based on 75 percent draw areas. He also used a 90 percent draw\n\n area and a weighted 95 percent draw area. Those increased draw areas captured some of the\n\n competitor sales that the 75 percent draw area excluded. 26 Dr. Israel then aggregated the local\n\n market share figures across all overlap customers in all markets, using distribution center square\n\n footage, adjusted revenues, and number of sales representatives to estimate market share.\n\n PX09350-137-139. As shown in the table below, 27 these alternative approaches-designated as\n\n variations (i) and (ii)-demonstrate that for half of the customers in overlap areas, Defendants\n\n would have a post-merger combined local market share of more than 50 percent and the HHI would\n\n increase at least 1,300 points. PX09350-139, Table 7. A quarter of the overlap customers would\n\n face even greater market concentrations: Defendants post-merger would have at least 68 percent\n\n in combined local market share and the HHI would increase by at least 2,000 points. And, 10\n\npercent of the overlap customers would face a combined market share north of 74 percent and an\n\nHHI increase of greater than 2,500 points. The picture that clearly emerges from these numbers\n\nis that, in many areas across the country, USF and Sysco already control a substantial share of the\n\nmarket for local broadline distribution. A merger between the two would lead to a significant\n\nincrease in market concentration in many areas.\n\n\n\n\n26\n   In a third variant, Dr. Israel went beyond the overlap areas and performed market calculations that took into account\nall local broadline customers, regardless of whether they fell into the overlap area. Dr. Israel also used a fourth\nvariant-though not entirely clear from his report-in which he appears to have re-run his 75 percent draw\nmethodology using all of Defendants' broadline customers in the overlap area, not just local broadline customers.\nPX09350-137-138.\n27\n   These figures are pre-divestiture share calculations. But the local market share percentages and HHI increases are\nso high that, even taking into account the divestiture, when aggregated across numerous markets, these figures are\nunlikely to decrease enough to change the overall picture.

For example, in an Investor Presentation,\n\ndated November 2012, USF represented that it \"estimated [having the] #1 or #2 position in- of\n\nserved markets.\" PX03000-014. Mr. Schreibman's investigational hearing testimony confirmed\n\nthe present-day accuracy of that statement Investigat'l Hr'g Tr., PX00515-017 at 65. He also\n\nconfirmed that, in many of those markets, Sysco occupied the number one or two market position.\n\nId\n\n                Another USF document, a strategy document created in 2011, shows USF and Sysco with\n\nsizeable \"market penetrations\" in many local markets.                                                                                                 PX03073-023-030. Mr. Schreibman\n\ntestified that \"market penetration\" was different from \"market share,\" as the former reflected the\n\npercentage of customers that purchased even $1 of product, whereas the latter reflected\n\n                                                                                                                       78\n\f percentages of overall sales volumes. Hr'g Tr. 1508-09. But even if \"market penetration\" and\n\n \"market share\" have different definitions, both concepts are a measure of market strength, and the\n\n\"market penetration\" percentages show USF and Sysco to be first and second in numerous markets.\n\nIndeed, the very same strategy document lists 54 separate markets and identifies Sysco as a\n\ncompetitor in each of them. Of those 54 markets, USF estimated that Sysco had the number one\n\nposition in   I   markets and that, within those   I    markets, USF was number two in   I·   USF also\n\nestimated that it was number one      inll markets, with Sysco ranked number two in those samell\nmarkets. And, in     II markets, USF viewed itself as tied for number one with Sysco.         Thus, of\n\nthe   I   local markets, USF viewed Sysco or USF as the leading broadliner inland as the number\n\ntwo broadliner (or tied for first)   inl. This internal assessment clearly supports Dr. Israel's local\nmarket share calculations.\n\n          Defendants offer a different ordinary course document to rebut Dr. Israel's market share\n\ncalculations. In 2013, relying on a sizeable third-party sales database of 335,000 independent\n\nrestaurants, USF calculated its share of sales to independent restaurants in 53 local markets. That\n\nstudy showed USF with market shares much lower than that shown by Dr. Israel's calculations,\n\nranging from a high     ofl percent in Columbia, South Carolina, to a low ofll percent in the\n\"Northwest.\" DX-00397-002.\n\n          But Defendants' reliance on the independent restaurant study as an indicator of local\n\nmarket shares is problematic for several reasons. First, there is no evidence that the underlying\n\ndatabase differentiated between purchases from broadline distributors and purchases from other\n\nchannels of distribution. The evidence has shown that, among foodservice customers, independent\n\nrestaurants are among the most likely to buy from other channels, such as specialty and cash-and-\n\ncarry. In other words, unless broadline sales are segregated from the rest-which the restaurant\n\n\n\n                                                       79\n\f study appears not to have done-the resulting market share estimate will underestimate USF' s\n\n actual share of only broadline purchases. A market share calculation that uses at its numerator\n\n purchases from all channels cannot be relied upon to determine USF's broadline market shares.\n\n          Second, no evidence was presented showing that the buying habits of independent\n\n restaurants is representative of other local broadline customers.      Thus, by focusing only on\n\nindependent restaurant purchasing, the data set does not provide an accurate picture oflocal market\n\nshares.\n\n          Third, the independent restaurant study's results conflict with other documents.      For\n\ninstance, USF's 2011 strategy document describes the company as having a \"[s]olid       4\" position\nin \"Reno/Sacramento,'' PX03073-019, but the restaurant study finds a less than 10 percent share\n\nin Reno, DX-00397-002. Similarly, the strategy document describes USF as having the             \"4\nposition\" in St. Louis, PX03073-018, but the restaurant study reported only a 13.3 percent share\n\nin the \"Missouri Group,\" DX-00397-002.\n\n          Finally, Dr. Israel's conclusions are corroborated by PFG's analysis of the local markets.\n\nIn January 2014, PFG made a presentation to the FTC in which it addressed the state of competition\n\nin various local markets. PFG, at the time, was represented by antitrust counsel, Kirkland & Ellis.\n\nBecause there was no comprehensive industry data for local market shares, PFG \"estimated local\n\nbroadline market shares based upon [distribution center] square footage, which PFGuses to gauge\n\ncompetitor strength in the ordinary course of business\"--one of the very methods that Dr. Israel\n\nused for calculating market shares. PX09045-019. PFG observed that, \"[w]hile not perfect, we\n\nbelieve this approach produces directionally correct results and can be useful in flagging areas\n\nthat merit closer consideration.\" Id (emphasis added). PFG's analysis showed that in six major\n\nmarkets-New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Denver, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles-a combined\n\n\n\n                                                 80\n\f Sysco-USP, based on distribution center square footage, would control between 45 percent (New\n\nYork City) to 80 percent (Las Vegas) of those local broadline markets. PX09045-020. PFG also\n\ncalculated that a merger in those markets would result in IIlil increases ranging from 1,000 points\n\n(New York City) to 3, 100 points (Las Vegas). Id Consistent with Dr. Israel's market shares and\n\nIIlil calculations, PFG concluded that the \"[p ]reliminary findings indicate significant\n\nconcentration in many local markets.\" Id\n\n               3.         The Court's Finding as to Local Broadline Customer Market Shares\n\n        The court thus finds, based on Dr. Israel's testimony and other evidence, that the FTC has\n\nshown that a merged Sysco-USP will significantly increase concentrations in local markets for\n\nbroadline distribution.     The FTC therefore has made its prima facie case and established a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the merger will lessen competition in the local markets.\n\n        C.     Additional Evidence of Competitive Harm\n\n        The FTC did not rely solely on increased IIllls to establish that Defendants' proposed\n\nmerger would cause competitive harm. See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 992 (\"The Herfindahl-\n\nHirschman Index cannot guarantee litigation victories.\").        It offered additional evidence to\n\nstrengthen its prima facie case, to which the court now turns.\n\n               I.      Unilateral Effects-National Customer Market\n\n       The FTC advanced a \"unilateral effects\" theory to argue that the merger would harm\n\ncompetition in both the national and local broadline distribution markets. In this section, the court\n\nconsiders the evidence of unilateral effects in the national customer market and subsequently turns\n\nto the evidence regarding local customer markets.\n\n       Courts have recognized that a merger that eliminates head-to-head competition between\n\nclose competitors can result in a substantial lessening of competition. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 717-\n\n\n\n                                                 81\n\f 19 (holding that elimination of competition between second- and third-largest jarred baby food\n\n manufacturers would weaken competition); Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 169 (finding a\n\n likelihood of unilateral price increase where merger would eliminate one of Swedish Match's\n\n\"primary direct competitors\"); Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1083 (finding anticompetitive effects where\n\nthe \"merger would eliminate significant head-to-head competition between the two lowest cost\n\nand lowest priced firms in the ... market.\"); see also Merger Guidelines § 6 (\"The elimination of\n\ncompetition between two firms that results from their merger may alone constitute a substantial\n\nlessening of competition.\").     In such circumstances, a merger \"is likely to have unilateral\n\nanticompetitive effect if the acquiring firm will have the incentive to raise prices or reduce quality\n\nafter the acquisition, independent of competitive responses from other firms.\" H&R Block, 833 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 81.\n\n       Unilateral anticompetitive effects can arise in a host of different settings. See generally\n\nMerger Guidelines § 6. Here, the FTC's case for unilateral effects rests on the fact that the\n\nbroadline distribution industry is marked by negotiations between buyers and sellers. In such a\n\nmarket, \"buyers commonly negotiate with more than one seller, and may play sellers off against\n\none another.\" Id § 6.2. If two competitors merge, buyers will be prevented from playing the\n\nsellers off one another in negotiations. See id This elimination of competition \"can significantly\n\nenhance the ability and incentive of the merged entity to obtain a result more favorable to it, and\n\nless favorable to the buyer, than the merging firms would have offered separately absent the\n\nmerger.\" Id\n\n       On the other hand, even if the merging parties had large market shares, if they were not\n\nparticularly close competitors, then the market shares might overstate the extent to which the\n\nmerger would harm competition. Although the merging parties need not be the top two firms to\n\n\n\n                                                 82\n\f cause unilateral effects, see, e.g., Heinz, 246 F.3d at 717-19; H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 83-\n\n 84, the FTC argues that the potential for unilateral effects here is magnified because Defendants\n\n are particularly close competitors and many national customers consider them the top two choices\n\nfor broadline distribution. See Merger Guidelines § 6.2 (\"Anticompetitive unilateral effects ...\n\nare likely in proportion to the frequency or probability with which, prior to the merger, one of the\n\nmerging sellers had been the runner-up when the other won the business.\").\n\n          The FTC offered various sources of evidence to show that the proposed merger will result\n\nin unilateral anticompetitive effects. The evidence includes empirical data collected and analyzed\n\nby Dr. Israel, Defendants' ordinary course documents, and testimonial evidence from other market\n\nactors.\n\n                        a.     Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding study\n\n          To show that Defendants were frequent head-to-head competitors-indeed, each other's\n\nclosest rivals-Dr. Israel analyzed each company's bidding opportunities for national customers\n\nbased on the RFP/bidding database that he compiled from the companies' records.                The\n\nRFP/bidding records that Dr. Israel collected spanned a seven-year period, from 2007 to 2014.\n\nPX09375-088. He formed the database not only from the parties' reconstructed RFP data, but also\n\nfrom a host of ordinary course records reflecting bidding opportunities, PX09375-089-091. From\n\nthis evidence, Dr. Israel concluded: \"[I]n competitions for National Broadline Customer business,\n\nboth USF and Sysco compete with and lose to one another much more than they compete with or\n\nlose to any other distributor and, indeed, more than all other distributors combined.\" PX09375-\n\n088. More specifically, based on Sysco's RFP/bidding records, Dr. Israel observed that USF\n\nappeared as a competitor for national broadline business twice as often as the next competitor and\n\nthat, when Sysco lost, it lost to USF two and a half times more often than it lost to the next\n\n\n\n                                                83\n\f competitor.   Similarly, based on USF's RFP/bidding records, Dr. Israel observed that Sysco\n\n appeared as a competitor for national broadline business four times as often as the next competitor\n\nand that, when USF lost, it lost to Sysco three and a half times more often than it lost to the next\n\ncompetitor. PX09350-105-109.\n\n        Defendants disputed the reliability of Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding data study in two primary\n\nways. First, as already discussed, they forcefully challenged the underlying data set, arguing that\n\nneither company keeps ordinary course RFP and bidding records and that Dr. Israel's reliance on\n\nthese artificially created data sets to calculate an empirical \"win-loss\" analysis is inherently flawed.\n\nAs previously explained, the court has found that drawing precise conclusions based on the\n\nRFP/bidding data is problematic because of the data's limitations.\n\n        Second, to demonstrate that the merger would not create unilateral anticompetitive effects,\n\nDefendants offered a \"switching study\" conducted by Dr. Bresnahan. A switching study, as the\n\nname implies, analyzes customers' decision to \"switch\" their business to other competitors. For\n\nhis study, Dr. Bresnahan acquired from a company called Aggdata the location information of tens\n\nof thousands of restaurant and hotel chain customers that are on either Sysco's or USF's \"national\n\ncustomer\" roster. He then analyzed Defendants' transaction records by quarter from the first\n\nquarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2013 to determine if either company provided broadline\n\ndistribution to a specific restaurant or hotel location. If either Defendant provided broadline\n\ndistribution, he tracked the company's sales to the location and noted if it lost sales to the location\n\nduring the period. If the company lost sales in a particular quarter, he checked the other defendant\n\ncompany's transaction records to see if it picked up the customer. If it did not, Dr. Bresnahan\n\nassumed that some other competitor did.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  84\n\f            So, for example, if USF's records showed that a particular Sonic franchise did not purchase\n\n from USF in a particular quarter, he would tum to Sysco's records to see if Sysco had picked up\n\n the customer; if it did, he counted it as a switch to Sysco; if not, he assumed that the customer\n\n purchased from another distributor and counted it as a switch to a competitor other than Sysco.\n\n Based on this analysis, Dr. Bresnahan concluded that Sysco and USF are not uniquely close\n\n competitors. He found that USF lost business to Sysco 15 percent of the time based on both\n\n revenue and number oflocations, and that Sysco lost business to USF 57 percent of the time based\n\n on revenue and 39 percent of the time based on number of locations. These percentages of\n\n switches, Dr. Bresnahan testified, were much lower than what one would have expected to see if\n\n Dr. Israel's national market shares were accurate.\n\n            For a variety ofreasons, the court cannot agree with Dr. Bresnahan's ultimate conclusion-\n\nthat USF and Sysco are not uniquely close competitors-based on his switching study. First,\n\nthough the number of observations in Dr. Bresnahan's study were significant, they were limited\n\nalmost exclusively to restaurant and hotel locations (including, it appears, restaurants served by\n\nSysco's systems division, SYGMA). 28 The observations did not include other types of large\n\nnational customers, such as GPOs, foodservice management companies, and large government\n\nagencies, which, as the evidence showed, spend large percentages of their foodservice distribution\n\nbudget on Defendants. As Dr. Bresnahan admitted, he does not claim that his switching analysis\n\nreflects the buying habits of these national customers. Hr'g Tr. 2180-82.\n\n           Second, the time period of Dr. Bresnahan' s study-two-and-a-half years-is shorter than\n\nthe seven-year time period covered by Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding analysis. Significant switches that\n\n\n\n\n28\n     The study did include one health care organization, Kaiser Permanente, and one GPO, Amerinet.\n\n                                                         85\n\f might have occurred between Defendants outside the two-and-a-half year period, therefore, were\n\nnot counted.\n\n        Third, the switching analysis does not capture the full extent of competition between\n\nDefendants (or between other competitors, for that matter), because it only tracks switches, not\n\ninstances where a customer might have played one broadliner off the other to get better pricing.\n\nThat kind of situation reflects actual competition at least as much as a switch, but such competition\n\nis not reflected in the data.\n\n        Fourth, unlike an RFP or bid situation, a switch does not necessarily equate to actual\n\ncompetition. A switch might have occurred for any number of reasons having nothing to do with\n\npricing or service (e.g., the customer's sister-in-law went to work for a competitor), but the study\n\ntreats every switch as a loss for competitive reasons.\n\n        Fifth, Dr. Israel's rebuttal report pointed out a number of limitations in Dr. Bresnahan's\n\nswitching analysis, including the exclusion of certain switches between Defendants and the\n\ntreatment of actual switches, such as timed phase outs from one Defendant to the other, as non-\n\nswitches.   PX09375-08 l-084.     Although Dr. Bresnahan testified that he corrected for these\n\ncriticisms and that the adjustments did not materially alter his results or conclusion, the need for\n\nthose adjustments reflects the limitations of drawing firm conclusions from such undifferentiated\n\ndata.\n\n        Finally, Dr. Bresnahan's conclusion that USF and Sysco are not close competitors brings\n\nhim into conflict with Defendants' other expert, Dr. Hausman. Dr. Bresnahan testified that,\n\nalthough he agrees that Sysco and USF are competitors, he did not think that one was a\n\n\"particularly strong price constraint\" on the other. Hr'g Tr. 2183. Dr. Hausman, on the other\n\nhand, unequivocally agreed that \"USF is a strong price constraint on Sysco.\" Id. at 2005. He\n\n\n\n                                                86\n\f testified Sysco and USF \"compete and they compete hard. I'd be the first to agree.\" Id. at 1986;\n\n see id. at 2037 (\"I am not arguing with you that-or disagreeing with you that Sysco and US Foods\n\n are important competitive constraints on each other.\").        Defendants do not explain how\n\nDr. Bresnahan's switching study can be reconciled with Dr. Hausman's unqualified opinion that\n\nDefendants mutually constrain each other's prices, which can only mean that they are close\n\ncompetitors; if they were not, the pricing of one would not matter to the other.\n\n        In the end, the court finds that Dr. Israel's RFP/bidding analysis is more persuasive than\n\nDr. Bresnahan's switching study. Both empirical studies are imperfect for the reasons already\n\ndiscussed. But Dr. Israel's analysis better captures instances of actual competition across a more\n\nrepresentative cross-section of national customers over a longer period of time.     Additionally,\n\nDr. Israel's conclusions are corroborated by other evidence in the record, which, as discussed\n\nbelow, indicate that Sysco and USF are close competitors, particularly for large national\n\ncustomers.\n\n                       b.     The parties' ordinary course documents\n\n       The FTC presented ordinary course documents, from both Defendants and third parties,\n\nwhich support Dr. Israel's conclusion that Sysco and USF are particularly close competitors. For\n\nexample, a 2012 USF presentation, titled \"Strategy Refresh,\" explains that one reason for strategic\n\nrethinking is that \"[c]ustomers perceive little difference between us and our main competitor,\"\n\nidentified as Sysco. PX0303 l-003 (emphasis added). The same presentation devotes a section to\n\n\"Performance v. Sysco\" and describes the companies as \"[i]ndustry leaders.\" PX0303 l-010-0l l.\n\nAnother USF document describes Sysco as USF's \"major rival.\" PX03032-043.\n\n       Similarly, a Sysco presentation to its Board of Directors describes USF as its \"next largest\n\ncompetitor\" and puts forth \"recent intelligence\" about USF and two other competitors. PX01007-\n\n\n\n                                                87\n\f 018; PX01007-023. Another Sysco strategy document focusing on the healthcare sector states that\n\n \"US Foodservice is our strongest competitor for Healthcare GPO dollars.\" PX01388-004.             In\n\n addition, there are many specific instances in the record demonstrating fierce competition between\n\n Sysco and USF for national customer accounts. 29 These documents indicate that Sysco and USF\n\n compete aggressively against one another on price; non-price incentives, such as signing bonuses;\n\n service; and other value-added offerings.\n\n           Industry analysts also have recognized the close competition between Defendants.\n\n For instance, the Cleveland Research Group's January 2014 market report on Sysco noted the\n\n Cleveland Research Group's assessment that \"both Sysco and US Foods have priced each other\n\n down competing for larger national/regional contract accounts over the last several years\" and that\n\n\"the acquisition removes a key price competitor (particularly with larger contract accounts).\"\n\nPX09332-004.\n\n                           c.      Testimonial evidence\n\n           A number of industry actors testified that they view Sysco and USF to be close competitors\n\nfor national customers. Particularly compelling testimony came from Mark Allen, the head of the\n\nfoodservice distributors' trade group, IFDA. In his deposition, Mr. Allen agreed that Sysco and\n\nUSF were \"closest competitors\" for national accounts, such as GPOs, hospitality, and foodservice\n\nmanagement companies. PX00570-012; PX00570-014. He further described Sysco and USF as\n\n\"powerful competitors\" for independent customers, PX00570-l 13, and testified that, in his\n\nexperience, GPOs, foodservice management companies, and hospitality chains use Sysco and USF\n\nto keep each other honest on price and service, PX00570-019. The testimony of the PFG's\n\nPresident and CEO, George Holm, was to the same effect. He testified that in his experience\n\n\n29\n     See, e.g., PX01066-001-002; PX03064-001; PX01061-001-006.\n\n\n                                                     88\n\f \"foodservice management companies, GPOs[,] and certain restaurant groups\" have \"obtained\n\n lower prices by bidding Sysco and US Foods against each other.\" Hr' g Tr. 651.\n\n                        d.      Conclusion on unilateral effects in the national customer market\n\n        The court's finding that Sysco and USF are close competitors in the national customer\n\n market is no surprise, given the uncontested facts of this case. Sysco and USF are the country's\n\ntwo largest broadliners by any measure. They have far more distribution centers, SKUs, private\n\nlabel products, sales representatives, and delivery trucks than any other broadline distributor. That\n\nthey rely on these competitive advantages to compete, and compete aggressively against one\n\nanother in the market for national customers, is amply born out on this record.\n\n        Based on all of the evidence presented, the court finds that, because the proposed merger\n\nwould eliminate head-to-head competition between the number one and number two competitors\n\nin the market for national customers, the merger is likely to lead to unilateral anticompetitive\n\neffects in that market. Evidence of probable unilateral effects strengthens the FTC's primafacie\n\ncase that the merger will lessen competition in the national customer market. See Heinz, 246 F.3d\n\nat 717 (footnote omitted) (finding that \"the FTC's market concentration statistics are bolstered by\n\nthe indisputable fact that the merger will eliminate competition between the two merging parties\");\n\nWhole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1043 (Tatel, J.) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(stating that \"there can be little doubt that the acquisition of the second largest firm in the market\n\nby the largest firm in the market will tend to harm competition in that market\").\n\n               2.      Merger Simulation Model-National Customer Market\n\n       To further show that the merger would harm national customers, Dr. Israel ran a merger\n\nsimulation model to predict the merger's effect. Dr. Israel used an \"auction model\" to estimate the\n\nharm to national customers based on his real-world observation that national customers used RFP\n\n\n\n                                                 89\n\f processes that \"typically involve[ d] competitive bids and bilateral negotiations between distributors\n\nand foodservice operators\" to award business. PX09350-l 10. Under an auction model, the terms\n\noffered by the winning bidder are determined (or at least heavily influenced) by the second-best\n\nbidder, because the winning bidder will offer price and service terms that are just good enough to\n\nwin the business. In theory, if the top two bidders merge, price and service terms will be determined\n\n(or at least heavily influenced) by the previously third-best bidder, who in a post-merger world\n\nwould move into the number two spot. An auction model predicts harm to customers if, as here,\n\nthe top two bidders merge and the next best bidder is a distant third. The magnitude of the harm is\n\ndefined as the difference between the values offered by the companies that had been the pre-merger\n\nsecond- and third-place bidders. PX09350-113-l 14; see CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 69\n\n(describing a similar auction model for predicting a price increase).\n\n        Practically speaking, the premise of Dr. Israel's auction model was that, in the pre-merger\n\nworld, Sysco and USF are national customers' top two choices and, therefore, each company sets\n\nthe other company's price. But, if they were to merge, the winning bidder's price would only be\n\nsubject to competitive pressure by a pre-merger third-place bidder, such as PFG or some other\n\ndistant competitor. If the next best bidder is not a major competitor, and therefore does not play a\n\nsignificant role in affecting prices, national customers will be harmed. An email dated December\n\n12, 2013, summarizing a \"USF Senior Teams\" webcast addressing the proposed merger, perfectly\n\ncaptures this core premise of Dr. Israel's model. The email identified as one of the \"key messages\":\n\n\"The 'distance' between the combined company and the next set of regional players is huge. Those\n\nregional players will have an even harder time trying to play catch up going forward because they\n\nsimply won't have the resources that the combined company has to transform the industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                 90\n\f PXOO 103-002 (emphasis added). The \"huge\" distance between the merged entity and the rest of\n\n the field corresponds to the merger harm that Dr. Israel's model predicts.\n\n        To quantify the likely harm to national customers, Dr. Israel performed calculations that\n\n used as inputs, among others, his estimates of the parties' national customer market shares and their\n\nprice-cost margins. PX09350-118. He concluded that, absent significant efficiencies and other\n\nmitigating factors, the merger would harm national customers on the order of more than $1. 4 billion\n\nannually. PX09350-120; PX09350-220. Factoring in the divestiture to PFG and its increased\n\nmarket share, Dr. Israel calculated likely merger harm of more than $900 million annually.\n\nPX09350-l 89; PX093 50-237.\n\n        Defendants assert that Dr. Israel's model is flawed for the same reason that they criticize his\n\nnational market share calculations-both rely on the unreliable RFP/bidding data. Specifically,\n\nDefendants argue that, because the merger simulation model relies on the national market share\n\ncalculations as a critical input, and because those market shares depend on the unreliable\n\nRFP/bidding data, Dr. Israel's estimate of likely merger harm is likewise unreliable. As discussed,\n\nthe court agrees that the RFP/bidding data set is imperfect and its resulting market share calculations\n\nare imprecise to some degree. Dr. Israel's most conservative market share analysis, however, did\n\nnot rely on the RFP/bidding data but rather on the CID data, and provided a reasonable\n\napproximation of the parties' share of the national customer market. Dr. Israel ran his merger\n\nsimulation using that lower-bound market share estimate and still reached the conclusion that,\n\nabsent significant efficiencies, the merger would likely cause significant harm. PX093 50-121 n.363\n\n(\"Finally, I tested the robustness of my results to Sysco and USF having lower combined shares. I\n\nfound that even when I use the lowest (and almost certainly too low) Sysco and USF shares\n\npresented in Table 1, the required efficiencies predicted by the model still far outweigh the\n\n\n\n                                                 91\n\f efficiencies claimed by the parties.\"). The court, therefore, concludes that Dr. Israel's merger\n\n simulation model strengthens the FTC's primafacie case that the merger will substantially lessen\n\n competition in the market for national customers.\n\n                3.     Unilateral Effects-Local Markets\n\n        As it did for the national customer market, the FTC presented empirical, documentary, and\n\ntestimonial evidence to demonstrate the potential for unilateral effects to harm local markets. That\n\nevidence, however, presented a more muddled picture of the potential for unilateral effects than\n\ndid the evidence for the national customer market.\n\n                       a.      Dr. Israel's empirical analysis\n\n        As he did with the national customer market, Dr. Israel looked at Defendants' business\n\nrecords to determine how closely they compete in local markets. The data came from two\n\nsources-USF's Linc database and Sysco's request for incentives (RFI) records.             The Linc\n\ndatabase, as discussed earlier, is a customer relations management tool used by USF sales\n\npersonnel to manage and store information on existing and prospective customer accounts. RFis\n\nare internal Sysco records that sales personnel were required to submit to regional presidents to\n\nobtain approval to offer incentives to customers to either switch to Sysco or stay with the company.\n\n       Starting with the Linc database, Dr. Israel observed and analyzed nearly 100,000 business\n\nopportunities between January 2011 and June 2014 and divided them into two groups-USP wins\n\nand USF losses. When USF won the business, sales personnel identified Sysco as the main\n\ncompetitor 43 percent of the time (and 48 percent of the time measured by revenue); when USF\n\nlost the business, USF sales personnel identified Sysco as the main competitor 46 percent of the\n\ntime (and 68 percent of the time measured by revenue). PX09350-143, Table 11. Whether USF\n\nwon or lost, sales personnel identified Sysco as the main competitor eight times more frequently\n\n\n\n                                                92\n\f than the next most mentioned competitors (PFG and Gordon Food Service). Dr. Israel also\n\n segregated the Linc database's mentions of competitors in 20 local markets. That study showed\n\n that sales personnel in every market identified Sysco as USF's main competitor by a wide margin,\n\n especially when measured by revenues. PX09350-145, Table 14.\n\n         The RFI data painted a similar picture from the Sysco perspective. Dr. Israel reviewed 224\n\n Sysco RFis, covering a three-year period from 2011 to 2014, when Sysco discontinued the\n\n practice. In more than 66 percent of the RFis, Sysco sales personnel identified USF as the reason\n\n for the incentive request.      No other competitor appeared more than 10 percent of the time.\n\nPX09350-146-147.\n\n         Defendants attacked Dr. Israel's reliance on the Linc database, as they did when he used it\n\nin his aggregate diversion analysis. They asserted that Dr. Israel improperly relied on the Linc\n\ndatabase as a win-loss record, when it was never intended as such. USF's Executive Vice President\n\nof Strategy, David Schreibman, testified that sales people did not use the database consistently and\n\nwould sometimes enter competitor information simply to fill in the database; ultimately, USF did\n\nnot rely on it to identify market competition. Hr'g Tr. 1505-06. Defendants also presented a local\n\nswitching study performed by Dr. Bresnahan, which used the same switching methodology as\n\ndescribed above but applied to local customers.               According to Dr. Bresnahan, when local\n\ncustomers switch away from Sysco, they switch to USF only 11 percent of the time; and when\n\nthey switch away from USF, they switch to Sysco only 15 percent of the time. Hr'g Tr. 2163. In\n\nother words, according to Dr. Bresnahan's switching analysis, when local customers switched\n\naway from Sysco it was typically to distributors other than USF. 30\n\n\n30\n   Dr. Bresnahan also did another switching study to support his findings. He conducted a study of fresh chicken\npurchases by customers in San Diego, from which he concluded that customers \"tum off and on buying fresh chicken\nfrom Sysco\" and that most of the time when they \"tum off' Sysco they buy from someone other than USF. Hr'g Tr.\n2162.\n\n                                                      93\n\f        The court finds that the empirical evidence, on balance, shows that Sysco and USF are\n\nclose competitors for local customers. As the court has already observed, relying on the Linc\n\ndatabase to draw firm conclusions is problematic for the reasons raised by Defendants. That said,\n\neven recognizing the data's limitations, it so overwhelmingly demonstrated primary competition\n\nbetween Sysco and USF based on a sizeable number of observations (nearly 100,000 entries) that\n\nit cannot be wholly disregarded as evidence of close competition. Furthermore, the court found\n\nthe RFI analysis especially compelling; indeed, Defendants did little to contest it. Although the\n\nnumber of observations was low, the RFI data overwhelmingly showed Sysco seeking incentives\n\nto attract or keep local customers in response to USF' s efforts far more often than Sysco attempted\n\nto respond to any other competitor's efforts.\n\n       Dr. Bresnahan's switching study provided some counterweight to Dr. Israel's work. Like\n\nhis national switching analysis, however, it did not account for competition when customers used\n\nSysco and USF as leverage against each other, as many local customers said regularly occurred.\n\nThe local switching study also relied heavily on chain restaurants and hotels and thus did not factor\n\nin the buying habits of other types of local customers, particularly independent restaurants.\n\nTherefore, notwithstanding the limits of the data sets relied on by Dr. Israel, the court finds that\n\nthe empirical evidence supports the conclusion that Sysco and USF are close competitors in local\n\nmarkets.\n\n                       b,     The parties' ordinaiy course documents\n\n       Two notable ordinary course documents also support the conclusion that Sysco and USF\n\nare close competitors for local customers.       The first is USF's November 2012 \"Investor\n\nPresentation,\" which represented that \"US Foods is estimated #1 or #2 position in     II of served\nmarkets.\" PX03000-014; see also PX03l18-006. As previously noted, USF's David Schreibman\n\n\n\n                                                94\n\f confirmed both the present-day accuracy of that statement and the fact that, in many of those\n\n markets, Sysco occupied the number one or two position. DX-00272 at 62, 65. The second is the\n\nJuly 2011 USF acquisitions strategy document, which estimated USF's position in 54 separate\n\nmarkets, apparently based on market penetration rather than market share. USF estimated that\n\neither Sysco or USF was the leading broadliner in       I   of those markets and was the number two\n\nbroadliner (or tied for first) in   I·   See also PX03002-009 (Clayton, Dubilier & Rice document,\n\ntitled \"Operating Review,\" acknowledging that one of Sysco's strengths is \"[g]eographic coverage\n\nin all the key markets in the U.S. - #1 or #2 in virtually all the markets in which they operate\");\n\nPX03004-001 (Clayton, Dublier & Rice memo stating that USF is a \"leader in both national and\n\nlocal markets\" and that \"Sysco [is the] closest competitor with similar business mix\"). Sysco's\n\nand USF's leading positions in multiple local markets shows that they are close competitors in\n\nthose markets.\n\n                        c.      Testimonial evidence\n\n        The testimonial evidence was more equivocal about the closeness of competition between\n\nDefendants. It demonstrated that Sysco and USF are strong competitors for local customers in\n\nseveral markets, but it also showed that other broadliners are competing effectively in many of\n\nthose areas.     The FTC's case featured four local markets:        (i) Columbia/Charleston, South\n\nCarolina; (ii) Omaha, Nebraska; (iii) Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina; and (iv) Southwest\n\nVirginia.   For each of those markets, the FTC presented testimonial evidence supporting\n\nDefendants' leading market positions. For instance, PFG's George Holm agreed that Sysco and\n\nUSF were the largest and two most \"competitively significant\" broadline distributors in\n\nColumbia/Charleston, Raleigh/Durham, and Southwest Virginia. Hr'g Tr. 653-57; DX-00276 at\n\n70-72. Mark Allen, IFDA President, agreed with those assessments, calling Defendants the\n\n\n\n                                                   95\n\f \"dominant\" or \"strongest\" competitors in those three markets (and Las Vegas). DX-00294 at 170;\n\n see also Hr'g Tr. 1800 (testimony from Sysco Mid-Atlantic President Mike Brawner stating that\n\n USF is a \"strong competitor\" in Columbia, Raleigh/Durham). USF's ordinary course materials\n\n corroborate those observations, at least in terms of market penetration.                      PX03 ll 8-007-008\n\n (showing USF as a \"Strong        4,\" based on market penetration, in Raleigh, Columbia, and Roanoke,\n with Sysco as number two in those areas, and showing Sysco as the number one broadliner in\n\n Omaha with USF a \"Distant         4\").\n          Yet, when customer-level testimony is considered, the evidence of Defendants' leading\n\n market positions and their post-merger ability to increase prices becomes less clear. Both sides\n\ndeposed and obtained numerous declarations from various customers in these local markets. The\n\ncustomer testimony obtained by the FTC invariably decried the merger's impact on local markets,\n\nwhereas Defendants' customer witnesses emphasized alternatives in the marketplace and the\n\nability to switch broadliners if the merged company attempted to impose a price increase. 31\n\n\n\n\n 31\n    Compare PX07020-002 (Champ McGee, owner of Little Pigs Barbeque and FTC-sponsored declarant expressing\n \"serious concerns\" about merger's effect on business in the Columbia market), and Hr'g Tr. 344 (FTC witness, Gary\n Hoffman, Vice President and Corporate Executive Chef of Upstream Brewing Company from the Omaha market,\n expressing concern that the proposed merger would prevent him from playing Defendants off one another), and\n PX00487-005 (FTC-sponsored declarant Jason Smith of 18 Restaurant Group, from the Raleigh/Durham market,\nexpressing concerning about the merger \"because it eliminates one of our only two options for broadline distribution\nservices\" and rejects other competitors), and Hr'g Tr. 544-45 (FTC witness, Daniel Schablein, Controller at\nWintergreen Resort from the southwestern Virginia market, stating that Sysco and USF were the only legitimate\nbroadliners for his business), with DX-00227 at 2 (Justin Brooks, owner of Frayed Knot Restaurant and Defendants-\nsponsored declarant, stating \"I do not believe that Sysco could raise prices or reduce services on my business\" in the\nColumbia market because of competition from PFG, Merchants, Reinhart, and Gordon Food Service), and DX-00191\nat 2 (Defendants-sponsored declarant Anthony Fucinaro of Anthony's Steakhouse, from the Omaha market, stating,\n\"If Sysco were to raise prices or lower service levels, I would move my contract to Reinhart, Martin Brothers, and/or\nCash-Wa\"), andDX-00232 at 2 (Defendants-sponsored declarant Patrick Cowden of Tobacco Road Sports Cafe, from\nthe Raleigh/Durham market stating, \"If Sysco tried to raise prices or decrease service quality following the merger, I\ncould and would replace them with any of the other bidders in a heartbeat\"), and DX-00209 at 1 (Defendants-\nsponsored declaration from George Huger of Southern Inn Restaurant, from the southwestern Virginia market, stating\nthat he would have alternatives, including PFG and Staunton Foods, ifhe became dissatisfied with Sysco's prices or\nservice after the merger).\n\n                                                         96\n\f Because of these conflicting local market assessments, the court cannot draw firm conclusions\n\n about the competitiveness of the local broadline markets from the testimonial evidence. 32\n\n                             d.       Conclusion on unilateral effects in the local markets\n\n          In the final analysis, after considering all of the record evidence on local markets, the court\n\n finds that the FTC has shown that unilateral effects are likely to occur in many local markets\n\n because the merger will eliminate one of the top competitors in those markets. Though the court\n\n finds the evidence of unilateral effects in the local markets to be less convincing than in the national\n\n customer market, the evidence nevertheless strengthens the FTC's prima facie case of merger\n\n harm.\n\n                   4.       Local Event Studies\n\n          To further show that the merger would adversely impact local customers, the FTC\n\npresented the results of an econometric event study conducted by Dr. Israel. Dr. Israel analyzed\n\n Sysco's opening of two distribution centers-one in Long Island, New York, in July 2012, and\n\none in Riverside, California, in June 2013-to determine the impact those openings had on prices\n\npaid by USF customers served from a nearby competing facility. Known as an \"entry study,\"\n\nDr. Israel selected the Long Island and Riverside events because they were the only two recent\n\ninstances in which Sysco had opened a new distribution center in the same market as a USF\n\ndistribution center. From these event studies, the FTC hoped to show that prices fell when Sysco\n\nand USF directly competed and that the merger's elimination ofUSF as a competitor would have\n\nan upward effect on pricing.\n\n\n\n32\n   The FTC did not present testimony or customer declarations about many of the markets that it claims will be highly\nconcentrated after the merger. That is not, however, fatal to its case. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 339, 341 (rejecting\nthe argument that the government had not proven its case because it did not present evidence \"in each line of commerce\nand each section of the country\" and stating that \"[t]here is no reason to protract already complex antitrust litigation\nby detailed analyses of peripheral economic facts, if the basic issues of the case may be determined through study of\na fair sample\").\n\n                                                          97\n\f           Dr. Israel found that Sysco' s entry in Long Island resulted in a 1.4 percent decline in USF' s\n\nprices for customers in the 75 percent overlap area. PX09350-148. He also ran variations of his\n\nregression analysis on other groupings---customers within a 50 percent overlap area, customers\n\npurchasing more than 100 SKUs, and customers buying private label products-and found that the\n\nprice decrease on these groupings was even greater. PX093 50-148. By contrast, Dr. Israel found\n\na less significant price impact in the Riverside entry study-a negligible price decline of only .06\n\npercent.\n\n        Dr. Israel explained that neither of these events were clean entry studies because, in both\n\ncases, Sysco already had an existing distribution facility in the area, and thus already was\n\ncompeting against USF.         In his opinion, the resulting price effects, therefore, were actually\n\nunderstated. Dr. Israel also found the results of the Long Island event more compelling than the\n\nRiverside event for two reasons. First, the Long Island facility was a greater distance away from\n\nSysco's existing facility than the new Riverside facility was from its existing facility. Second, the\n\nLong Island facility served more new business than the Riverside facility. For those reasons, he\n\nconcluded, the Long Island study better approximated a true entry event. Hr'g Tr. 1097-98.\n\nDr. Israel ultimately concluded, based largely on the Long Island study, that the merger's\n\nelimination of USF as a competitor would have an upward pricing effect in local markets.\n\n       The court does not find Dr. Israel's entry studies to be convincing evidence that the merger\n\nwill harm local customers. Dr. Israel's efforts to distinguish the Long Island and Riverside events\n\nsimply do not hold up. Defendants' expert, Dr. Bresnahan, showed that the difference in distance\n\nbetween the Riverside facility and its nearby existing facility, on the one hand, and the Long Island\n\nfacility and its nearby existing facility, on the other, was a mere 14 miles. He also showed that\n\nboth new Sysco facilities served a similar fraction of existing Sysco customers. Thus, the two\n\n\n\n                                                    98\n\f entry events were not as dissimilar as Dr. Israel testified, yet they produced very different results-\n\n one showing a significant price decrease, the other showing a negligible one. There may be\n\n location-specific reasons for the different results, but the reasons offered by Dr. Israel do not\n\n withstand scrutiny and no other evidence explained the difference. The court thus cannot conclude\n\n from these seemingly conflicting entry studies that the merger will harm local customers.\n\n        The court further notes that the pricing evidence here is far weaker than that found in other\n\nmerger cases. In Staples, for instance, there was \"compelling evidence\" showing that prices were\n\n 13 percent higher in markets where Staples did not have competition from another office\n\nsuperstore. 970 F. Supp. at 1075-76 (pricing study). Similarly, in Whole Foods, an entry study\n\nshowed that Whole Foods dropped its prices by five percent when another organic supermarket\n\nopened in the area. 548 F.3d at 1046-47 (Tatel, J.). In fairness, the FTC was unable to conduct\n\npricing studies like those done in Staples and Whole Foods here because Defendants have\n\ncompeting facilities in nearly every local market. But the absence of convincing pricing effects\n\nevidence is the weakest aspect of the FTC's case.\n\n                5.     Summaty\n\n        In summary, the FTC has bolstered its prima facie case with additional proof that the merger\n\nwould harm competition in both the national and local broadline markets. Although the FTC's case\n\nwould have been strengthened with more convincing pricing effects evidence, the court\n\nnevertheless finds that the FTC has presented a compelling prima facie case of anticompetitive\n\neffects. See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991 (\"The more compelling the prima facie case, the more\n\nevidence the defendant must present to rebut it successfully.\"). The court now turns to Defendants'\n\nrebuttal arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 99\n\f III.   DEFENDANTS' REBUTIAL ARGUMENTS\n\n        The FTC has established a presumption that the proposed merger will substantially lessen\n\ncompetition. Defendants, however, may rebut that presumption by showing that the traditional\n\neconomic theories of the competitive effects of market concentration are not an accurate indicator\n\nof the merger's probable effect on competition or that the procompetitive effects of the merger are\n\nlikely to outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 715. The more\n\n\"compelling the [FTC's] prima facie case, the more evidence the defendant must present to rebut\n\n[the presumption] successfully.\" Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991. \"A defendant can make the\n\nrequired showing by affirmatively showing why a given transaction is unlikely to substantially\n\nlessen competition, or by discrediting the data underlying the initial presumption in the\n\ngovernment's favor.\" Id\n\n        Defendants advance four arguments to support their claim that the food industry will\n\nremain competitive after the merger: (i) a post-divestiture PFG will be a strong competitor for\n\ncustomers seeking nationwide distribution; (ii) competition from other broadliners and other\n\ndistribution channels will continue and grow; (iii) the entry of new competition and the\n\nrepositioning of existing competitors will keep the industry competitive; and (iv) customers will\n\nbenefit from efficiencies arising from the merger. The court addresses each of those arguments in\n\ntum and finds that, even taken collectively, Defendants cannot overcome the FTC's strong\n\npresumption of anticompetitive harm.\n\n        A.

That is, the\n       divestiture assets must be substantial enough to enable the purchaser to maintain\n       the premerger level of competition, and should be sufficiently comprehensive that\n       the purchaser will use them in the relevant market and be unlikely to liquidate or\n       redeploy them.\n\f 2004 Policy Guide at 9 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted); see also 2011 Policy Guide at 8.\n\n With these principles in mind, the court analyzes the effect of the proposed divestiture.\n\n                I.      Competitive Pressure Exerted by Post-Divestiture PFG\n\n        Defendants argue that the divestiture of 11 \"strategically located\" USF distribution centers\n\n to PFG, coupled with PFG' s \"aggressive\" expansion across the country, will \"replace [any]\n\n competitive intensity lost as a result of the merger.\" Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law, ECF No. 171 at 156 [hereinafter DFF] (alteration in original) (quoting 2004\n\nMerger Guidelines at 5). In addition to the 11 divested distribution centers, PFG's owner, The\n\nBlackstone Group, a leading private equity firm, has committed $490 million to develop seven\n\nmore distribution centers (called \"foldouts\") and to expand capacity in 16 existing facilities.\n\nHr'g Tr. 724, 767-69; DFF at 155. Defendants also point to the industry acumen and experience\n\nof PFG's executives, particularly that of its President and CEO, George Holm, who has over 37\n\nyears of experience in the foodservice distribution industry. The court does not doubt Blackstone's\n\nfinancial commitment to PFG or Mr. Holm's leadership capabilities. However, based on the\n\nevidence presented, the court is not persuaded that post-merger PFG will be able to step into USF' s\n\nshoes to maintain-certainly not in the near term-the pre-merger level of competition that\n\ncharacterizes the present marketplace.\n\n       PFG's five-year business plan shows that post-merger PFG will not be nearly as\n\ncompetitive as USF is today. In the lucrative market for national customers, the plan projects that\n\nPFG will have approximately    ti billion in national breadline sales by 20 l 9-less than half of\nUSF's 2013 national broadline sales o f . billion. PX09350-074; PX09060-002; PX09060-\n\n004; PX09060-006; PX09253-023. Stated in terms of market share, PFG estimates that it will\n\ngrow to 20 percent of the national breadline market over five years, with the merged Sysco-USP\n\n\n\n                                                102\n\f company having the \"remaining share of the national broadline business.\" PFF at 220; Hr'g Tr.\n\n 719, 721-22. That percentage is smaller than USF's share of the national broadline customer\n\n market today.    PX09350-187 (Dr. Israel's report stating \"the best case scenario under the\n\ndivestiture is the emergence of a significantly smaller competitor than USF even several years into\n\nthe future\"). Defendants are correct that the divestiture does not have to replicate pre-merger HHI\n\nlevels. However, the fact that PFGonly expects to achieve less than halfofUSF's current national\n\ncustomer sales in five years-assuming that its planned expansion efforts are successful-does\n\nnot demonstrate that PFG will be sufficiently able to \"discipline a merger-generated increase in\n\nmarket power.\" See 2011 Policy Guide at 8 (footnote omitted).\n\n        The court's concern about PFG's ability to compete effectively in the post-merger world\n\nis not limited to sales and market share projections. PFG's short-term effectiveness will depend\n\nin large part on its ability to incorporate the 11 formerly-USP-held distribution centers. Even\n\nassuming that PFG can do so seamlessly, the new PFG will have only 3 5 distribution centers-far\n\nfewer than the at least 100 distribution centers owned by the combined Sysco/USF. Having only\n\none-third of the merged company's distribution centers will put PFG at a significant disadvantage\n\nin competing for national customers. Indeed, as Dr. Israel demonstrated, Defendants' largest\n\nnational customers use more than 3 5 distribution centers. Those customers represent    I   percent\n\nof Sysco's national broadline revenues, and   I   percent of USF's national broadline revenues.\n\nPX09375-075-077, Figure 3. The court is not convinced that these large national customers will\n\nconsider a post-merger PFG to be as capable of meeting their needs as USF is today.\n\n       Defendants counter that \"PFG will be able to compete aggressively with its additional\n\ndistribution centers because the fewer the distribution centers used for a particular customer, the\n\ngreater the inbound efficiencies.\" DFF at 161-62. Because of higher volume per warehouse and\n\n\n\n                                               103\n\f lower freight costs, Defendants claim, many customers prefer to be served out of fewer distribution\n\n centers-so having a larger number of distribution centers is not necessarily a competitive\n\nadvantage. Id at 28, 161-62; Hr'g Tr. 1570-71, 1573-74; DX-00264at122-23. For example, to\n\nserve Zaxby's, a regional quick serve chain, PFGtrucks drive past some of their own distribution\n\ncenters because the longer drive \"proves cheaper for the customer.\" DFF at 161; Hr'g Tr. 852.\n\nPFG can also take advantage of\"shuttling,\" a technique of caravanning multiple trailers on a single\n\ntruck, to increase efficiencies. DFF at 162; Hr' g Tr. 855-57. Mr. Holm even stated at his\n\ndeposition that he believed that PFG would be able to s e r v e - out of 35 distribution centers\n\nmore effectively than USF currently does out    ofll DX-00276 at 96.\n        The court is skeptical of Defendants' claim that, even with far fewer distribution centers,\n\nPFG will be on equal competitive footing with the merged firm, especially for national customers.\n\nDefendants' own growth belies this fact. Both Sysco and USF have, over time, increased their\n\nnumber of distribution centers, demonstrating that Defendants view more distribution centers to\n\nbe a competitive advantage. Indeed, when Defendants presently compete for national business,\n\nthey highlight their nationwide geographic coverage to potential customers. See, e.g., PX03000-\n\n0l4 (USF presentation touting its \"[a]bility to leverage our national scale to cost effectively service\n\ncustomers nationally); PX00247-001-002 (USF email communication t o - describing\n\nthe \"US Foods Value Proposition\" as including a \"Privately held National Distribution footprint\n\ncompany\"); PX01062-005 (Sysco presentation to -                 highlighting that Sysco's \"national\n\nfootprint, strong service approach and our breadth of product offerings is what differentiates us\n\nfrom our competition\"); PX00279-001 (USF email t o - (a restaurant chain), mentioning\n\n\"national footprint and scale\" as a selling point); PX00281-006 (slide presentation t o .\n\n                        touting USF's \"extensive\" distribution network). USF's Executive Vice\n\n\n\n                                                 104\n\f President of Strategy David Schreibman also testified that USF has the ability to leverage its\n\n national scale to cost-effectively service customers, and that USF views its national scale as a\n\n significant competitive advantage.           Hr'g Tr. 1521-22; see also PX03010-001 (internal USF\n\n document stating that the \"[o ]nly 'true' options for both Premier and Novation is either Sysco or\n\n USF[;] [t]he regional players will bid, but not be seriously considered\"). Furthermore, there was\n\n no evidence presented that Defendants have moved to consolidate their distribution facilities to\n\n take advantage of the supposed benefits of having fewer distribution centers. 33\n\n         Notably, not even PFG has always considered the divestiture of only 11 distribution centers\n\n to be sufficient for it to compete on a national level. A PPG internal strategy document, dated\n\n April 3, 2014, sets forth two \"final\" proposals for additional distribution centers \"necessary to\n\n establish a national broadline network.\" One proposal included options of 16 to 20 distribution\n\n centers, and the other included a list of 14 to 15. Hr'g Tr. 669-71 (discussing PX09193). Six\n\nmonths later, in October 2014, after PFG had started negotiations with Sysco about the divestiture,\n\ninternal PFG communications re-affirmed the need for more than 11 distribution centers.\n\nFollowing Sysco's proposal to sell only seven distribution centers, a PFG board member wrote to\n\nGeorge Holm:\n\n         I would still find a way to tell the FTC that we think it takes 13 but that Sysco won't\n         let us look at more than 7 which will get us nowhere near a national solution. We\n         need the package size to be bigger to have any chance of winning and to ever\n         compete nationally. ... [We] should proactively educate the FTC why 13 opcos\n         [another word for distribution center] is the bare mimimum.\n\nPX09192-001 (emphasis added); see also PX00526-036; PX00526-141-142; PX09190. PFG did\n\njust that when it met with the FTC, making the case that it needed 13 distribution centers to\n\n\n\n33\n  Defense counsel at oral argument represented that USF recently had closed two distribution centers, Closing Arg.\nHr'g Tr. 113, but counsel for the FTC noted that USF also recently had opened a new distribution center, id. at 125-\n26.\n\n                                                       105\n\f\"compete effectively for national business.\" PX00526-039 at 153; PX09070 (PFG's presentation\n\nto the FTC with a map of 13 USF distribution centers needed by PFG, which included the four\n\nmetropolitan areas mentioned below). Ultimately, PFG was not able to negotiate the sale of more\n\nthan 11 distribution centers, with Sysco having made the decision that it \"would rather litigate\n\nw[ith] the FTC than sell more than 11.\" PFG felt that it was \"prudent to engage on 11 for now to\n\nkeep the momentum/dialogue going.\" PX09157-002; PX00526-041at163.\n\n        Having fewer distribution centers means that PFG will face coverage gaps m the\n\ngeographic areas where it sought, but did not receive, a distribution center. Those areas include:\n\nCincinnati, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Los Angeles, California,\n\nwhere PFG received a different, smaller distribution center than it requested. PX00526-039 at\n\n155-56; see also PX09070.\n\n        Defendants argue that PFG' s requests to Sysco for a larger number of distribution centers\n\nthan they actually received was part of a bargaining strategy. Closing Arg. Hr'g Tr. 115-16.\n\nHowever, PFG's recognition that it needed more than 11 distribution centers to compete nationally\n\nis reflected in internal documents that were created months before PFG began negotiating with\n\nSysco. The court credits those internal projections over PFG's current position that an additional\n\n11 distribution centers is enough to compete for national customers. See Amicus Br. of PFG, ECF\n\nNo. 133 at 22-24 (arguing that PFG will be able to compete effectively with 35 distribution\n\ncenters).\n\n       Defendants argue that, with the planned \"foldouts,\" i.e., new distribution facilities located\n\nin contiguous geographic markets, PFG will have more than the 13 distribution centers it was\n\nseeking, including one in Cincinnati. DX-01706 at 14. However, PFG has never done a foldout,\n\nand according to internal estimates, these facilities may not be operational until, at the earliest,\n\n\n\n                                                106\n\f several years following the merger. 34 Defendants assert that \"PFG will be well-positioned to bid\n\n on Day One,\" because even after the bids are submitted, discussions between a customer and a\n\n distributor can take up to a year before a contract is finalized, and PFG can continue its foldout\n\n efforts in the meantime. DFF at 160 (emphasis added). According to Defendants, if the customer\n\n needs service sooner, PFG can provide service via shuttling until the foldout is complete. Id at\n\n 161. However, there is substantial evidence showing that customers value having distribution\n\n centers close to their locations and that distribution costs increase with driving distance. Thus the\n\n court is not persuaded that-even with promises of foldouts and the use of shuttling-a sufficient\n\n number of national customers will view PFG as a viable alternative to the merged entity \"on day\n\none\" to maintain the intensity that characterizes the present competition between Sysco and USF.\n\n                   2.      Additional Disadvantages Faced by Post-Merger PFG\n\n         In addition to its lack of nationwide geographic coverage, the court has other concerns\n\nabout PFG's ability to compete against the merged entity. Because it will purchase in smaller\n\nproduct volumes than the merged Sysco entity, PFG could face higher product acquisition costs,\n\nor cost of goods sold (\"COGS\"), than its competitor. PX05051-003 (Blackstone Memorandum\n\nindicating that \"due to its scale, USF has better procurement than PFG and the 11 [distribution\n\ncenters] will likely spend more to acquire private label products and get less supplier rebate\n\ndollars\"); PX09350-205 (Dr. Israel's opinion that, even with the divestiture, PFG is unlikely to\n\nmake up the gap in COGS between itself and the parties today). PFG also will offer substantially\n\nfewer SKUs than the merged entity. PFG today sells less than half the total number of SKUs as\n\nUSF and one third the number of private label SKUs. PX06055-004 (USF offers 350,000 SKUs,\n\n\n\n34\n   PFG' s Senior VP of Operations estimated that PFG' s \"priority\" foldouts in Cincinnati, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan and\nBuffalo, New York, will not be operational until fiscal year 2018, and Montgomery, Alabama will not be operational\nuntil 2017. Hr'g Tr. 735-38.\n\n                                                        107\n\f of which 30,000 are private label); PX09507-007; PX09507-013 (PFG offers 150,000 SKUs, of\n\n which- are private label). PFG's fewer SKU offerings will be a competitive disadvantage.\n\n        PFG also will face disadvantages in terms of human resources. Defendants point out that,\n\nas part of the divestiture package, PFG would acquire over \"4, 400 USF personnel, including senior\n\nexecutives and personnel with healthcare expertise at the 11 distribution centers, and corporate\n\nregional leadership, national sales personnel, merchandising personnel, and others with national\n\nsales expertise; [and] a 12 month non-solicit of PFG employees at the 11 distribution centers.\"\n\nDFF at 155 (citing Hr'g Tr. 815-25; DX-06100 at 1). However, even assuming that every USF\n\nemployee at the 11 distribution centers becomes a PFG employee, PFG will still have fewer than\n\nhalf the sales representatives of either Sysco or USF today and less than one-quarter of the sales\n\nrepresentatives of the combined firm. PX09350-181-184, Figure 18. And, PFGwill only receive,\n\nat most, one-fifth of the national sales employees at USF dedicated to serving national customers.\n\nHr'g Tr. 1528-31 (stating that only about 20 percent ofUSF's national account team will be made\n\navailable for PFG to hire).\n\n       Moreover, PFG will be at a competitive disadvantage in its ability to offer value-added\n\nservices. The lucrative healthcare segment is illustrative. George Holm conceded that PFG has\n\nhad limited success with national healthcare customers. Hr' g Tr. 716-17. Some of that lack of\n\nsuccess is due to PFG's limited footprint, but it is also attributable to PFG's lack of expertise in\n\nthe healthcare segment and its inability to deliver value-added services to those customers. See,\n\ne.g., PX00594-025at100 (PFGhas a very small portion o~ members' business because\n\nPFG lacks acute care expertise); PX00474-001 (\"PFG offers a more limited selection of\n\nhealthcare-specific products than US Foods.\"). Even if over time PFG can acquire health care\n\nexpertise, in the short run it will be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to the merged\n\n\n\n                                                108\n\fentity. 35 For instance. Joan Ralph, Group Vice President of Premier testified that. even with the\n\nhealthcare employees PFG acquires through the divestiture. PFG will have significantly less\n\nhealthcare expe1tise than USF today. Hr'g Tr. 413: PX09350-21 l-212. And. as IFDA President\n\n1vfark Allen testified. Sysco and USF have the best understanding of the healthcare class of trade.\n\nDX-00294 at 121. The merger would only enhance that strategic advantage.\n\n               3.      Posf-1\\ferger PFG as an Independent Competitor\n\n        A final factor that cuts against the divestiture as a proposed fix is that PFG will be\n\ndependent on the merged entity for years following the transaction. \"In order to be accepted.\n\ncurative divestitures must be made to ... a \\villing, independent competitor capable of effective\n\nproduction .... \" CCC Holdings, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As the court\n\nobserved in CCC Holdings, it cau be a ''problem'' to allow \"continuing relationships between the\n\nseller and buyer of divested assets after divestiture. such as a supply ruTangement or technical\n\nassistance requirement which may increase the buyer's vulnerability to the seller's behavior.\" Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the Transition Services Agreement PFG will have\n\ncomplete access to USF private label products for three years at its I I new distribution centers.\n\nand therefore will be relying on the merged entity to license those products to PFG. See DX-06100\n\nat I; PX09060-005. PFG will also have the right to license USF's database for at least five years,\n\nwith a continuing option for five more. PFG, therefore, will noi be a truly independent competitor.\n\n\n\n\n                                               109\n\f        For the foregoing reasons, the court is not persuaded that the proposed divestiture will\n\n remedy the anticompetitive effects of the merger.\n\n        B.      Existing Competition\n\n                /.      Regionalization\n\n        Defendants assert that existing competition can and will constrain potential price increases\n\nor other unilateral effects in the national customer market. Their primary argument is that the ability\n\nof national customers to switch or threaten to switch to a network of regional distributors will inhibit\n\nanticompetitive behavior by the merged company. See Defs.' Opp 'n Br. at 40-41. Defendants point\n\nto many large national customers who multi-source their foodservice distribution needs, including\n\nusing various regional broadliners to service individual locations. Defendants cite as examples\n\nAmerinet, Sodexo, the Defense Logistics Agency,-, Subway, a n d - , all of whom\n\noperate regionally under multiple contracts. See id at 15.\n\n        But, for several reasons, the ability to regionalize is not likely to inoculate national\n\ncustomers from potential anticompetitive effects.       The decision of many large customers to\n\npredominantly use one breadline distributor is not simply a preference, as Defendants would\n\ncharacterize it, but a rational business decision. As already discussed, for the most part, the largest\n\nnational customers-particularly GPOs, foodservice management companies, and hospitality\n\ncompanies-predominantly rely on Sysco or USF for their breadline distribution needs. The largest\n\ncustomers, generally speaking, make from 61 percent to 100 percent of their breadline purchases\n\nfrom Sysco or USF. See FTC Closing Slide 35; PFF at 113-16. Even customers who contract\n\nregionally, such as -            and - ' buy in very high quantities from Defendants.\n\nRegionalization is available today, as it will be after the merger. But market actors are not moving\n\nto that model. To the contrary, as PFG's George Holm testified, the \"clear trend\" among large\n\n\n\n                                                 110\n\f customers is to move to a single nationwide provider. Hr'g Tr. 597-98. The court can only infer\n\n from this trend that regionalization is not a reasonable option for many national customers.\n\n        Regionalization likely has not taken hold for a variety of reasons. The record shows that\n\nwhen a customer increases its number of distributors, it incurs greater management and supply chain\n\ncosts, making it far less desirable to switch to a multi-regional model.       The court found the\n\ndeposition testimony of Dan Cox, the President and CEO of DMA, particularly illuminating, given\n\nthat the reason for DMA' s existence is to consolidate the product and service offerings of multiple\n\nregional distributors and compete for national customers. Mr. Cox testified that using a sole source\n\nbroadliner \"forms the most efficient supply chain.\" DX00265 at 44. He explained that \"[m]ore\n\nproducts at each delivery reduces our cost to service and therefore reduces their supply chain costs.\n\n     By aggregating [customers'] spend it makes the delivery system more efficient.\" Id. at 44-45.\n\n        A regional arrangement also brings with it the disadvantage of multiple points of contact.\n\nAs Mr. Cox testified, a single point of contact simplifies communications, which DMA touts as an\n\nadvantage over multi-sourcing broadline distribution. Id. at 14, 46, 68. He also added that a single\n\ninformation technology system is important to national customers, and DMA offers such a platform\n\nto attract them. As Mr. Cox explained: \"[I]f they come to DMA and deal with five different\n\nmembers, they wouldn't have to learn and understand five different order entry platforms. We have\n\njust one platform.\" Id at 68. A multi-regional approach thus likely would require a customer to\n\ndevelop greater information technology capabilities to manage its foodservice distribution\n\ncontracts.\n\n        Another downside of a multi-regional model is the difficulty in obtaining consistent\n\nproducts-particularly private label products-across a national customer's different locations.\n\nMr. Cox offered the example o f - , with which DMA does over -                  million in business.\n\n\n\n                                                111\n\f-         demands that DMA comply with its product specifications \"at a level of 90 percent,\" id\n\n at 74, indicating that even when a large customer uses multiple regional distributors, they impose\n\n rigorous demands with regard to product consistency. Product consistency, of course, can be\n\n achieved by purchasing from multiple distributors who carry the same brand-named products. But\n\nthat approach would limit a customer's ability to purchase private label products, which typically\n\noffer a better value proposition than branded products.\n\n        PFG's George Holm concurred with Dan Cox's assessment of national customers' business\n\nneeds and why they avoid regionalization. When asked why large national customers contract\n\nmainly with either Sysco or USF and why there is a clear trend toward those customers using a\n\nsingle broadliner, Holm offered numerous reasons: the \"ability to get SKUs in quickly\"; \"one place\n\nto contact\"; \"[o]ne IT system\"; \"[o]ne sales contract\"; \"[o]ne person to deal with\"; \"the same\n\nproduct [across] their system\"; writing \"one check as opposed to several\"; \"simplified contract\n\nadministration\"; and easier \"management of approved item lists and specifications.\" Hr' g Tr. 600-\n\n04. The court thus concludes that the possibility ofregionalizing broadline foodservice is not likely\n\nto protect national customers from the merger's anticompetitive effects.\n\n               2.      DMA\n\n       Today, the only other competitor with a nationwide footprint is DMA. Defendants claim\n\nthat DMA is capable of effectively competing against the merged entity because it provides a\n\nsingle point of contact, a single contract with consistent terms across customer locations, and a\n\nsingle ordering platform. DFF at 165-66 (citing DX-00265 at 63-64, 66, 68). The court disagrees.\n\n       Defendants acknowledge that DMA is not a one-stop-shop for national customers as Sysco\n\nand USF are today. Indeed, Defendants recognize that \"larger customers 'look to [DMA's]\n\n\n\n\n                                                112\n\fmembers regionally ... rather than D:NIA as a national solution.\"' Id. at 164-65 (quoting DX-\n\n00265 at 86).\n\n\n\n                                                      As Dan Cox, the President and CEO of DMA,\n\nexplained:\n\n\n\n\nDX-00265 at 64-65. As a result,\n\n                             Id. at 65.\n\n       National customers who value private label products, such as GPOs or foodservice\n\nmanagement companies,\n\n\n\n-·                       Id. at 79-80.\n\n                                    See id. at 224-26.\n\n      And, even if a national customer wanted to switch to DMA,\n\n                                          As   ~Jr.   Cox explained. '\n\n\n\n\n                          \" Id. at 99.\n\n\n\n\n                                                113\n\f                                                                                                Id. at\n\n 100, 157. For example,                    recently considered switching its business to DMA, but\n\ndecided to stay with Sysc                                                                . Id. at 227-\n\n29.\n\n                                                               , the court does not view DMA as a\n\nviable competitor that can constrain a post-merger Sysco.\n\n                3.     Conclusion as to Existing Competition\n\n        Based on the evidence presented, the court is convinced that national customers will be\n\nbetter off in a marketplace that has two strong competitors capable of nationwide broadline\n\ndistribution than in a marketplace in which there is a single undisputed heavyweight of broadline\n\ndistribution whose only competitive constraints is a transitioning PFG, DMA, and a collection of\n\nregional players.\n\n        C.     Entr-y of New Firms and Expansion of Existing Competitors\n\n        Defendants argue that the entry of new competitors and the expansion of existing\n\ncompetitors will keep the industry competitive. If a court finds that \"there exists ease of entry into\n\nthe relevant product market,\" that finding \"can be sufficient to offset the government's prima facie\n\ncase of anti-competitiveness.\" Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 55. \"The prospect of entry into\n\nthe relevant market will alleviate concerns about adverse competitive effects only if such entry\n\nwill deter or counteract any competitive effects of concern so the merger will not substantially\n\nharm customers.\" Merger Guidelines § 9. Ease of entry must be \"timely, likely, and sufficient in\n\nits magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract the competitive effects of concern.\" Id.\n\n(emphasis added).     As with their other rebuttal arguments, Defendants bear the burden of\n\ndemonstrating the ability of other distributors to \"fill the competitive void\" that will result from\n\n\n\n                                                114\n\f the proposed merger. See Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 169. Defendants assert that a lack\n\n of technological, legal, and regulatory barriers makes entry into the foodservice distribution\n\n industry relatively easy. Yet although all it may take is a \"guy and a truck\" to become a foodservice\n\n distributor, becoming a broadline foodservice distributor with the ability to compete for national\n\ncustomers is another thing altogether.\n\n        The broadline foodservice distribution industry is extraordinarily capital and labor\n\nintensive. It costs roughly $35 million to build a single distribution center. Hr' g Tr. 586. In\n\naddition, the distribution center must be stocked with goods. A fleet of expensive, refrigerated\n\ntrucks is required to deliver the products. People-lots of them-are needed to sell the broadline\n\nservice, maintain and stock the warehouse, and deliver the products. See Swedish Match, 131 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 171 (finding high barriers to entry where the evidence showed \"substantial sunk costs\n\nin plant construction, product development, and marketing\" required to compete). And, even if a\n\nnewcomer were to make the substantial investment to start a broadline distribution company, there\n\nis no guarantee that customers will follow. Incumbency is a powerful force in the foodservice\n\ndistribution industry.   See H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 75 (finding that \"importance of\n\nreputation and brand in driving consumer behavior\" limited an existing competitor's ability to\n\nexpand). Even if it were possible for a new entrant to overcome the incumbent's advantage, it\n\nwould take years. These high barriers to entry will further entrench the merged company's market\n\npower. PX03003-005 (USF lender presentation describing broadline foodservice distribution as\n\nhaving \"High barriers to entry for scale players\").\n\n       Defendants also contend that existing firms have demonstrated the capacity to expand to\n\ncompete against the merged firm. They highlight the fact that other broadline distributors-\n\nincluding Shamrock, Ben E. Keith, and Reinhart-started out as small businesses serving only\n\n\n\n                                                115\n\f limited items to local customers, but were able to grow to regional prominence. They describe\n\n examples of competitors that have recently opened new facilities or plan to do so.\n\n        But none of these examples overcome the fundamental problem with expansion as a\n\n constraint on the merged company-like new entry, successful expansion is extraordinarily capital\n\nintensive and demands a long time horizon. Based on their assessment that expansion would not\n\nbe an economically viable strategy, regional distributors have said that they have no plans to\n\nexpand or reposition in order to serve national customers. - ' w h i c h has           I   distribution\n\ncenters mostly located in the                      , has told the FTC that such a massive expansion\n\nwould not be \"viable\" in the short term, given the \"time and cost required.\" P.xm-006. Other\n\nregional distributors, including\n\nhave similarly been dissuaded by the time, costs, or risks of expansion. P.xm-036 at 139-42;\n\nP.xm-004; P.xm-003; P.xm-005-006; P.xm-048-049.\n\n        Companies rarely enter new markets without an existing customer base because the costs\n\nand risks are prohibitive. There is a real \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with such expansion, known\n\nin the industry as \"greenfield\" expansion.       Companies will not make the significant capital\n\nexpenditure of building a new distribution center unless they already have customers to serve, but\n\ncustomers will not commit to a distributor unless it has demonstrated the ability to serve its needs.\n\nAs a result, expansion in the industry is typically done through \"foldouts\"-building distribution\n\ncenters in contiguous geographic areas-so that customers can be served from an existing facility\n\nuntil the new facility is built. But even foldouts take time to succeed. They can take from one to\n\nthree years to complete, and it can take four to five years for a foldout facility to achieve sales per\n\nsquare foot similar to established broadline facilities. PX00529-042 at 166-68; Hr'g Tr. 837-39;\n\nsee also PX00558-051 at 201-04. Although a foldout strategy may preserve competition in a\n\n\n\n                                                 116\n\f particular local market, it cannot effectively be used to replace the competition benefitting national\n\n customers lost by the merger. The only way in which a regional player could expand sufficiently\n\n and quickly enough to compete with the merged company would be through a sizeable acquisition\n\nof multiple distribution centers.\n\n        In summary, the court finds that, absent a substantial acquisition opportunity, expansion\n\nby regional players will not be timely, likely, and of sufficient magnitude to counteract\n\nanticompetitive harm.     See Cardinal Health, 12 F.

Efficiencies\n\n                I.     Requirement for Merger-Specific and Verifiable Efficiencies\n\n        Although the Supreme Court has never recognized the \"efficiencies\" defense in a Section 7\n\ncase, the Court of Appeals as well as the Horizontal Merger Guidelines recognize that, in some\n\ninstances, efficiencies resulting from the merger may be considered in rebutting the government's\n\nprimafacie case. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 720 (citations omitted). Where, as in this case, the court finds\n\nhigh market concentration levels, defendants must present \"proof of extraordinary efficiencies\" to\n\nrebut the government's prima facie case.        Id (citations omitted) (requiring \"extraordinary\"\n\nefficiencies to rebut an increase in HHI of 510 points); see also Areeda & Hovenkarnp 3d ed.,\n\nsupra, if 97lf (requiring \"extraordinary\" efficiencies where the \"HHI is well above 1800 and the\n\nHHI increase is well above 100\"). The court is not aware of any case, and Defendants have cited\n\nnone, where the merging parties have successfully rebutted the government's prima facie case on\n\nthe strength of the efficiencies. See CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 72 (stating that \"courts\n\n\n\n                                                 117\n\f have rarely, if ever, denied a preliminary injunction solely based on the likely efficiencies\"). Yet\n\n even if evidence of efficiencies alone is insufficient to rebut the government's primafacie case,\n\n such evidence may nevertheless be \"relevant to the competitive effects analysis of the market\n\n required to determine whether the proposed transaction will substantially lessen competition.\"\n\nArch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 151 (citations omitted).\n\n        The court must \"undertake a rigorous analysis of the kinds of efficiencies being urged by\n\nthe parties in order to ensure that those 'efficiencies' represent more than mere speculation and\n\npromises about post-merger behavior.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 721. Specifically, the court must\n\ndetermine whether the efficiencies are \"merger specific\"-meaning they represent \"a type of cost\n\nsaving that could not be achieved without the merger\"-and \"verifiable\"-meaning \"the estimate\n\nof the predicted saving must be reasonably verifiable by an independent party.\" H&R Block, 833\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 89 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Merger Guidelines § 1O); Cardinal\n\nHealth, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 62 (\"In light of the anti-competitive concerns that mergers raise,\n\nefficiencies, no matter how great, should not be considered if they could also be accomplished\n\nwithout a merger.\"). Defendants bear the burden of demonstrating that their claimed efficiencies\n\nare merger specific, H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 90, which requires demonstrating that the\n\nefficiencies \"cannot be achieved by either company alone,\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 722.             And,\n\nDefendants must also demonstrate that their claimed efficiencies would benefit customers. CCC\n\nHoldings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 74.\n\n       Defendants claim that the merger will generate over one billion dollars in annual cost\n\nsavings and operational synergies and, \"[e]ven when discounted substantially for unforeseen\n\nintegration complications, possible customer loss, and the divestiture, the merged company's\n\nefficiencies are expected to generate over $600 million in savings.\" DFF at 178. Defendants argue\n\n\n\n                                                118\n\f that the $600 million efficiencies estimate is \"the product of meticulous analysis and planning,\"\n\n which occurred over the course of eight months and involved over 100 employees at McKinsey,\n\nan independent consulting firm, and over 170 Sysco and USF employees who are extremely\n\nfamiliar with the business. Id. at 179. As Defendants explained, \"Sysco, USF, and McKinsey\n\nreviewed a back-breaking amount of information from the merging firms, analyzed historical\n\nintegration data, modeled possible cost-savings opportunities, and built a new organizational\n\nstructure around the companies' combined customer base, and designed detailed day 1, day 100,\n\nand year 1 plans for integration.\" Id. Of the $600 million cost savings identified by McKinsey,\n\nDefendants' expert Dr. Hausman identified more than $490 million as merger specific. To rebut\n\nDr. Hausman's opinion on efficiencies, the FTC presented Mr. Rajiv Gokhale of Compass\n\nLexecon as an expert in financial economics. He opined that at least 65 percent of Defendants'\n\nefficiencies were not merger specific. PX09351-007.\n\n       The court does not question the rigor and scale of the analysis conducted by McKinsey.\n\nNor does the court have any reason to question the accuracy of McKinsey' s total annual cost\n\nsavings estimate. But that is not the issue before the court. The issue is whether Defendants have\n\nshown that the projected \"merger-specific\" cost savings are substantial enough to overcome the\n\npresumption of harm arising from the increase in market concentration and other evidence of\n\nanticompetitive harm. As to that question, the court is unpersuaded that Defendants' combination\n\nwould result in $490 million in merger-specific cost savings. Defendants have not shown that that\n\namount, or at least a substantial portion of it, could not be achieved independently of the merger.\n\nNor does it appear that Dr. Hausman conducted any independent analysis of the McKinsey\n\nestimate to determine which savings, if any, can be achieved without the merger.\n\n\n\n\n                                               119\n\f        Sysco did not hire McK.insey to identify merger-specific savings for antitrust purposes.\n\nRather, it initially hired McK.insey in the fall of 2013 to determine whether a merged company\n\ncould achieve enough cost savings to make the combination worthwhile. Hr' g Tr. 1862-63. After\n\nMcKinsey concluded that the merger would generate sufficient cost savings and Sysco and USF\n\nannounced the merger, McK.insey began a more in-depth analysis beginning in January 2014 to\n\nidentify \"particular synergies that would arise from the deal.\" Id. at 1864-65. Carter Wood, the\n\nMcKinsey Director who led the effort, testified that his firm was hired \"to estimate what is possible\n\nby combining these two companies such that, number one, they would have confidence or not to\n\ngo ahead with the deal; and two, to create value for the newly integrated company.\" Id. at 1914.\n\nMcK.insey was not given instructions on identifying merger-specific savings, and Mr. Wood\n\ntestified that he was not familiar with the term \"merger specific.\" Id. at 1904.\n\n       Dr. Hausman used McK.insey's projections as his baseline for identifying merger-specific\n\nsavings. Id. at 2053. However, it is not clear what independent analysis Dr. Hausman did to\n\nreduce McK.insey's projected savings of $600 million annually to    sll million in merger-specific\nsavings. In his report, Dr. Hausman explained:\n\n       In my previous academic research I have emphasized the effect of cost saving\n       efficiencies on marginal cost, which can be approximated by average variable cost.\n       Thus I will take a conservative approach to the estimated efficiencies and focus on\n       cost savings from changes in variable costs that arise from the merger and would\n       not occur otherwise.\n\nDX-01355 at 67 (footnote omitted). It is not apparent, however, how Dr. Hausman calculated\n\nmerger-specific savings using this approach, as neither his testimony nor his report spell out\n\nprecisely how he went about identifying the amount of variable cost savings to include in his\n\nmerger-specific estimate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                120\n\f         Table 4a of Dr. Hausman's rebuttal rep01t illustrates the difficulties with verif}\"ing his\n\n analysis.

(iii) Sales, and (iv) Corporate. In each of those four\n\ncategories, Dr. Hausman listed the component pa1ts (in the first column) and the conesponding\n\namounts (in the fourth colmnn) that comprise the category cost savings estimate. Yet for each of\n\n                                                   121\n\f these elements, Dr. Hausman relied exclusively on documents created by either McKinsey or\n\n Defendants. See DX-01353 at Ex. C, 2 n.i. He performed no independent analysis to verify these\n\n numbers. Id. (\"All source material is either Sysco, US Foods, or McKinsey material and I take\n\n those materials at face value.\").\n\n        But even taking Dr. Hausman's variable cost savings numbers as presented, the court is\n\nnot convinced that the full $490 million in projected savings is merger specific. For example,\n\nnearly half of the -     million in merger-specific savings identified by Dr. Hausman come from\n\nthe \"Merchandising\" category, also known as \"category management.\" The $281 million that\n\nDr. Hausman attributed to category management cost savings comes directly from McKinsey' s\n\ncalculations. Category management refers to a process of optimizing a distributor's product\n\nassortment by gaining insights into which SKUs its customers value and then optimizing the SKU\n\ninventory to match customers' demands and procure those products in the most cost-efficient\n\nmanner. Hr'g. Tr. 1881. Both companies prior to the merger already were undertaking category\n\nmanagement efforts. PX00592-035 at 137-40; PX00592-049 at 193-94.\n\n        Although McKinsey Director Mr. Wood testified that McKinsey made an effort to identify\n\nonly incremental merchandising savings, that is, savings arising only because of the merger, he\n\ncould not say whether the $281 million included some cost savings that Defendants might have\n\nbeen able to achieve separately. For instance, before the merger, Sysco was undergoing a category\n\nmanagement program, called Project Naples, which was due to end in June 2015. However,\n\nProject Naples covered only two-thirds of Sysco's product categories; Sysco planned to complete\n\nthe remaining categories at a later date. Mr. Wood testified that the $281 million figure was in\n\naddition to the Project Naples costs savings, but he could not say whether or not that number was\n\n\n\n\n                                              122\n\f in addition to the cost savings that Sysco could achieve through its continued cost savings efforts\n\n beyond June 2015.\n\n        USF, meanwhile, suspended its category management project after the merger's\n\nannouncement.       At the time the merger was announced, USF had only conducted category\n\nmanagement    onl tol categories out of 300.      PX00592-035at139; PX00592-048-049at192-\n\n93. Mr. Wood could not say whether the $281 million was in addition to cost savings that USF\n\nmight have achieved had it continued its category management program. Thus, Dr. Hausman's\n\nestimate of $281 million in \"merger-specific\" savings in Merchandising-a number that, again,\n\nrelied exclusively on McKinsey's calculations-likely overstates the achievable merger-specific\n\ncategory management savings.\n\n        The FTC has pointed to, and Defendants have not rebutted, other ways in which\n\nDr. Hausman's reliance on McKinsey's estimates likely overstated the savings arising from the\n\nmerger. During the hearing, Mr. Wood acknowledged that part of the sales synergy estimate-\n\nwhich represents savings from combining the salesforces of the two companies-would be\n\nachieved by having customers place orders via an e-commerce platform. However, migration to\n\nelectronic ordering can be achieved by either company independently of the merger. Hr' g Tr.\n\n1904-05. Another savings strategy identified by McKinsey, \"maximizing backhaul,\" refers to\n\nhaving delivery trucks stop by suppliers to reload goods on their way back to the warehouse, in\n\norder to save an extra trip to those suppliers. Hr'g Tr. 1894-95. However, backhaul savings can\n\nalso be achieved independently of the merger. See Hr' g Tr. 1905-06.\n\n               2.      Insufficiency ofEstimated Merger-Specific Savings\n\n       Even if the court were to credit Dr. Hausman's total estimate of merger-specific\n\nefficiencies, the figure would only amount to less than one percent of the merged entity's annual\n\n\n\n                                               123\n\f revenue. PX09375-l 18 (Dr. Israel's rebuttal report stating that Dr. Hausman's original estimate\n\n of merger-specific, variable cost efficiencies of -      million per year represents only one percent\n\n of Sysco and USF's combined annual broadline revenue). 36 Even assuming that 100 percent of\n\n the cost savings would be passed on to customers, the savings are unlikely to outweigh the\n\n competitive harm to customers. Since the savings are equal to a small percentage of the combined\n\n company's total revenue, even a modest increase in price could offset any cost savings generated\n\n by the efficiencies. At oral argument, Defendants' response to this concern was that the market\n\n would not allow even a slight price increase, as customers would exercise their other options, such\n\n as regionalizing. See Closing Arg. Hr' g Tr. 117-18. Having found that this merger will result in\n\n high national customer and local market concentration levels, the court does not share Defendants'\n\n confidence that the market would not tolerate such a price increase. As the court observed in\n\n Cardinal Health, \"[t]he critical question raised by the efficiencies defense is whether the projected\n\nsavings from the merger[ ] are enough to overcome the evidence [showing] that possibly greater\n\nbenefits can be achieved by the public through existing, continued competition.\" 12 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 63. Here, Defendants have fallen short of making that showing.\n\n        E.      Conclusion\n\n        Upon consideration of all of the evidence presented, the court concludes that Defendants'\n\nrebuttal evidence is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of anticompetitive harm that the\n\nFTC was able to establish through evidence of high post-merger market concentrations and other\n\nevidence of competitive harm. The court thus concludes that the FTC has met its burden of\n\ndemonstrating a likelihood of success. That is, the FTC has raised \"questions going to the merits\n\nso serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful as to make them fair ground for thorough\n\n\n36\n  In 2013, Sysco and USF's combined broadline revenue wasiHJjiiJ.1•!=11PX09350-216, Table 27. One percent\nof that sum is greater than Dr. Hausman' s merger-specific cost savmgs estrrnate o f . million.\n\n                                                  124\n\f investigation, study, deliberation and determination by the FTC in the first instance and ultimately\n\n by the Court of Appeals.\" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 714-15 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n IV.     THE EQUITIES\n\n         Although the court has found that the FTC has shown a likelihood of success on the merits\n\nand thus created a presumption in favor of injunctive relief, see Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 172, Section 13(b)'s \"public interest\" standard still requires the court to weigh the public and\n\nprivate equities of enjoining the merge, Heinz, 246 F.3d. at 726. Here, the primary public interests\n\nto be considered include (i) the public interest in effectively enforcing antitrust laws and (ii) the\n\npublic interest in ensuring that the FTC has the ability to order effective relief if it succeeds at the\n\nmerits trial.\n\n        The public's interest in enforcing antitrust law plainly favors enjoining Defendants'\n\nproposed merger.      See id. (\"The principle public equity weighing in favor of issuance of\n\npreliminary injunctive relief is the public interest in effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.\");\n\nSwedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 173 (\"There is a strong public interest in effective enforcement\n\nof the antitrust laws that weighs heavily in favor of an injunction in this case.\").\n\n        The second public interest factor-preserving the FTC's ability to order effective relief\n\nafter the administrative hearing-also supports an injunction. As stated by the Court of Appeals,\n\n\"if the merger were ultimately found to violate the Clayton Act, it would be impossible to recreate\n\npre-merger competition\" because the merging parties would have already combined their\n\noperations and they would be difficult to separate, even by a subsequent divestiture order. Id.\n\n(\"Section 13(b) ... embodies Congressional recognition of the fact that divestiture is an inadequate\n\nand unsatisfactory remedy in a merger case.\"). That problem is amplified here because the\n\n\n\n                                                 125\n\f proposed merger involves two transactions, not just one: (i) Sysco's merger with USF and (ii)\n\nPFG's purchase ofUSF's distribution centers and other assets. The parties have represented that,\n\nabsent an injunction, Sysco and USF will merge their operations and divest 11 distribution centers\n\nand associated assets-including personnel, IT Systems, and USF private label products-to PFG,\n\nwhich will incorporate those assets into its own operations. As the FTC has pointed out, it would\n\nface an especially daunting and potentially impossible task of \"unscrambling\" the eggs (i.e.,\n\nreturning the merging companies to their pre-merger state) if the ensuing administrative\n\nproceedings were to determine that the merger violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Additionally,\n\nit is difficult to conceive how a subsequent divestiture order-which would attempt to restore the\n\nparties to their pre-merger state-could be fulfilled without causing significant disruption to the\n\nfoodservice distribution industry, its customers, and the ultimate consumers-Americans who eat\n\noutside the home.\n\n       Defendants contend that the public equities weigh against granting the preliminary\n\ninjunction because the merger will generate substantial efficiencies that will be passed on to\n\ncustomers. They claim that, ifthe FTC obtains the injunction, Defendants and their customers will\n\nbe harmed because \"Sysco and US Foods will abandon the merger and consumers will be deprived\n\nof its benefits.\" DFF at 186-87 (citing Hr' g Tr. 1516-17). But the court cannot conclude, on this\n\nrecord, that the merger's cost savings will outweigh the potential harm to customers from losing\n\nthe country's second largest broadline distributor as a competitor for their business. Dr. Israel's\n\nmerger simulation model predicted that, even taking into account the estimated cost savings, the\n\nmerger would harm customers. PX09350-l 14-121, Table 3. Although the court has reservations\n\nabout some of Dr. Israel's merger simulation model inputs, the court finds that the record as a\n\n\n\n\n                                               126\n\f whole-at the very least-raises substantial questions about whether the merger will harm\n\n consumers. Therefore, the public equities here favor granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n         The court recognizes the extraordinary amount of time, energy, and money that Sysco,\n\n USF, and PFG have devoted to the proposed merger. Their efforts, and the risk that the parties\n\n will abandon the merger rather than proceed to an administrative trial on the merits is, however,\n\n\"at best, a private equity\" which cannot overcome the significant public equities weighing in favor\n\nof a preliminary injunction. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        In the end, after considering the record in its entirety, the court returns to Judge Tatel's\n\nobservation in Whole Foods: \"[T]here can be little doubt that the acquisition of the second largest\n\nfirm in the market by the largest firm in the market will tend to harm competition in that market.\"\n\nWhole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1043 (Tatel, J.) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe court finds that the FTC has carried its burden of showing a \"reasonable probability\" that a\n\nmerger of the country's two largest broadline foodservice distributors, Sysco and USF, would harm\n\ncompetition. Defendants' merger is likely to cause unduly high market concentrations in two\n\nrelevant markets-broadline foodservice distribution to national customers and broadline\n\nfoodservice distribution to local customers-and eliminate a key competitor in those markets,\n\nUSF.   The evidence offered by Defendants to rebut the FTC's showing of likely harm was\n\nunavailing. The equities also favor granting the requested preliminary injunction. The FTC,\n\ntherefore, has established that it is likely to succeed in proving, after a full administrative hearing,\n\nthat the effect of Sysco' s proposed acquisition of USF \"may be substantially to lessen competition,\n\nor to tend to create a monopoly\" in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  127\n\f       The court thus grants the FTC's Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
