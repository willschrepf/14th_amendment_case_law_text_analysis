</span>Appellant\r\nBencor, Inc. appeals the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor\r\nof appellee The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company.<span>  </span>In three issues, Bencor argues that the trial\r\ncourt erred in: (1) granting VALIC’s traditional motion for summary\r\njudgment; (2) denying Bencor’s cross-motion for partial summary judgment;\r\nand (3) awarding attorney’s fees and costs to VALIC.<span>  </span>We affirm.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b><span><span>I.<span>                 \r\n</span></span></span></b><b><span>Background<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bencor was formed in 1990 for the\r\npurpose of developing and marketing various employee benefit plans for\r\ngovernmental employers and their employees.<span> \r\n</span>Among the retirement investment benefit plans developed by Bencor were\r\nthe “3121 Plan” and the “Special Pay Plan.”<span> \r\n</span>VALIC specializes in developing and marketing retirement products and\r\nservices to employees of governmental entities, educational groups, and other\r\norganizations.<span>  </span>The two companies entered\r\ninto a marketing agreement, whereby Bencor agreed to design and market the 3121\r\nPlans and Special Pay Plans, and VALIC agreed to provide investment vehicles\r\nfor the retirement plans and the expertise of its national sales force.<span>  </span>In consideration of Bencor’s performance of\r\nits obligations under the marketing agreement, VALIC agreed to pay Bencor\r\ncompensation in the form of various commissions and bonuses as set out in the\r\nagreement.</span><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bencor and VALIC eventually\r\nrenegotiated the marketing agreement to change the rates of compensation.<span>  </span>Under the agreement’s first amendment, VALIC\r\nremained obligated to pay certain specified commissions and bonuses</span><span>.<span> \r\n</span><span>The amended agreement further\r\nprovided that, with the exception of the amended terms, “[a]ll terms and\r\nconditions of the [original] Agreement shall remain valid and binding in\r\naccordance with its terms. . . .<span>  </span>[N]o\r\nother enlargement or diminution of rights or responsibilities under the\r\nAgreement [was] either intended or recognized [by the parties].”<p></p></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\nparties operated under the revised marketing agreement for twenty-two\r\nmonths.<span>  </span>In November 2004, VALIC informed\r\nBencor that it would cease paying current and future commissions and bonuses in\r\nlight of a perceived miscalculation and overpayment of commissions and bonuses,\r\nwhich it believed had occurred over the life of the agreement.<span>  </span>Bencor ultimately initiated arbitration\r\nproceedings to resolve the dispute, seeking damages for amounts earned, a\r\ndeclaration of its rights under the agreement, and other relief.<span>  </span>It argued in its pre-hearing brief that it\r\nwas entitled to damages for past-due and future commissions, and during the\r\nFebruary 2006 arbitration, it presented evidence of future damages under the\r\nmarketing agreement through November 2007.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\narbitration panel issued an order and award, as well as findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.<span>  </span>The panel concluded\r\nthat the amended marketing agreement did not eliminate VALIC’s obligation to\r\npay the disputed commissions and bonuses, and that VALIC breached the marketing\r\nagreement when it refused to pay commissions and bonuses on existing and new\r\ncases.<span>  </span>The panel further concluded that\r\nBencor did not breach the amended marketing agreement and that it was entitled\r\nto compete with VALIC after payments under the marketing agreement ceased.<span>  </span>The panel denied all of VALIC’s claims and\r\ncounterclaims and ordered it to pay over $8 million in damages and over\r\n$1 million in costs and attorney’s fees.<span> \r\n</span>The award stated that it fully resolved all claims, counterclaims and\r\ndisputes of fact advanced by the parties, and that all claims not expressly\r\ngranted were denied.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Bencor\r\nmoved to confirm the arbitration award in the federal district court\r\nproceeding, and the court issued a final judgment confirming the arbitration\r\naward and dismissing all the parties’ claims and counterclaims.<span>  </span>VALIC paid Bencor all of the damages awarded\r\nby the arbitration panel.<span>  </span>Subsequently,\r\nVALIC has not paid and refuses to pay post-termination commissions to which\r\nBencor contends it remains entitled to receive under the terms of the\r\nagreement.<span>  </span>It is VALIC’s refusal to pay\r\npost-termination commissions for existing 3121 Cases and Special Pay Plan Cases\r\nthat is the basis of this lawsuit.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bencor sued VALIC for breach of\r\ncontract, declaratory judgment, and an accounting.<span>  </span>VALIC filed a motion for summary judgment\r\nasserting that res judicata barred Bencor’s claims because they had previously\r\nbeen litigated before the arbitration panel.<span> \r\n</span>The trial court granted VALIC’s motion for summary judgment, denied\r\nBencor’s motion for partial summary judgment, and dismissed all of Bencor’s\r\nclaims with prejudice.<span>  </span>The trial court\r\nlater vacated and re-entered summary judgment against Bencor, reserving the\r\nissue of attorney’s fees for trial.<span>  </span>The\r\nissue of attorney’s fees was tried to a jury, which awarded VALIC $200,122.50\r\nin fees plus conditional appellate fees.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On appeal, Bencor argues that the\r\ntrial court erred in granting VALIC’s motion for summary judgment and in\r\ndenying its motion for partial summary judgment.<span>  </span>Bencor also argues that VALIC was not\r\nentitled to fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act because the trial court’s\r\nruling on its motion for summary judgment mooted Bencor’s declaratory judgment\r\nclaim, that the fees assessed were unjust and inequitable, that the evidence\r\nwas insufficient to support the jury’s award of attorney’s fees, and that the\r\ntrial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on VALIC’s duty to segregate\r\nfees.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b><span><span>II.<span>              \r\n</span></span></span></b><b><span>Res judicata<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>VALIC argues that this lawsuit\r\ninvolves a claim for future damages that Bencor has already pleaded and proved\r\nbefore the arbitration panel.<span>  </span>It argues\r\nthat Bencor “is suing the same defendant under the same section of the same\r\ncontract [and] asserting the same breach and the same future damages,” which\r\ncould have been and were litigated, and for which Bencor has already received\r\nan award for damages.<span>  </span>Bencor contends\r\nthat the arbitration panel did not have jurisdiction over the claims involved\r\nin this lawsuit because they were unripe at the time of arbitration.<span>  </span>Bencor also argues that the principles of res\r\njudicata are inapplicable because the claims asserted before the arbitration\r\npanel were different from the claims asserted in this lawsuit, i.e., the claims\r\ninvolve different breaches of different compensation provisions in the\r\nmarketing agreement.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We

</span>Appellant\r\nBencor, Inc. appeals the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor\r\nof appellee The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company.<span>  </span>In three issues, Bencor argues that the trial\r\ncourt erred in: (1) granting VALIC’s traditional motion for summary\r\njudgment; (2) denying Bencor’s cross-motion for partial summary judgment;\r\nand (3) awarding attorney’s fees and costs to VALIC.<span>  </span>We affirm.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b><span><span>I.<span>                 \r\n</span></span></span></b><b><span>Background<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bencor was formed in 1990 for the\r\npurpose of developing and marketing various employee benefit plans for\r\ngovernmental employers and their employees.<span> \r\n</span>Among the retirement investment benefit plans developed by Bencor were\r\nthe “3121 Plan” and the “Special Pay Plan.”<span> \r\n</span>VALIC specializes in developing and marketing retirement products and\r\nservices to employees of governmental entities, educational groups, and other\r\norganizations.<span>  </span>The two companies entered\r\ninto a marketing agreement, whereby Bencor agreed to design and market the 3121\r\nPlans and Special Pay Plans, and VALIC agreed to provide investment vehicles\r\nfor the retirement plans and the expertise of its national sales force.<span>  </span>In consideration of Bencor’s performance of\r\nits obligations under the marketing agreement, VALIC agreed to pay Bencor\r\ncompensation in the form of various commissions and bonuses as set out in the\r\nagreement.</span><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bencor and VALIC eventually\r\nrenegotiated the marketing agreement to change the rates of compensation.<span>  </span>Under the agreement’s first amendment, VALIC\r\nremained obligated to pay certain specified commissions and bonuses</span><span>.<span> \r\n</span><span>The amended agreement further\r\nprovided that, with the exception of the amended terms, “[a]ll terms and\r\nconditions of the [original] Agreement shall remain valid and binding in\r\naccordance with its terms. . . .<span>  </span>[N]o\r\nother enlargement or diminution of rights or responsibilities under the\r\nAgreement [was] either intended or recognized [by the parties].”<p></p></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\nparties operated under the revised marketing agreement for twenty-two\r\nmonths.<span>  </span>In November 2004, VALIC informed\r\nBencor that it would cease paying current and future commissions and bonuses in\r\nlight of a perceived miscalculation and overpayment of commissions and bonuses,\r\nwhich it believed had occurred over the life of the agreement.<span>  </span>Bencor ultimately initiated arbitration\r\nproceedings to resolve the dispute, seeking damages for amounts earned, a\r\ndeclaration of its rights under the agreement, and other relief.<span>  </span>It argued in its pre-hearing brief that it\r\nwas entitled to damages for past-due and future commissions, and during the\r\nFebruary 2006 arbitration, it presented evidence of future damages under the\r\nmarketing agreement through November 2007.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\narbitration panel issued an order and award, as well as findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.<span>  </span>The panel concluded\r\nthat the amended marketing agreement did not eliminate VALIC’s obligation to\r\npay the disputed commissions and bonuses, and that VALIC breached the marketing\r\nagreement when it refused to pay commissions and bonuses on existing and new\r\ncases.<span>  </span>The panel further concluded that\r\nBencor did not breach the amended marketing agreement and that it was entitled\r\nto compete with VALIC after payments under the marketing agreement ceased.<span>  </span>The panel denied all of VALIC’s claims and\r\ncounterclaims and ordered it to pay over $8 million in damages and over\r\n$1 million in costs and attorney’s fees.<span> \r\n</span>The award stated that it fully resolved all claims, counterclaims and\r\ndisputes of fact advanced by the parties, and that all claims not expressly\r\ngranted were denied.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Bencor\r\nmoved to confirm the arbitration award in the federal district court\r\nproceeding, and the court issued a final judgment confirming the arbitration\r\naward and dismissing all the parties’ claims and counterclaims.<span>  </span>VALIC paid Bencor all of the damages awarded\r\nby the arbitration panel.<span>  </span>Subsequently,\r\nVALIC has not paid and refuses to pay post-termination commissions to which\r\nBencor contends it remains entitled to receive under the terms of the\r\nagreement.<span>  </span>It is VALIC’s refusal to pay\r\npost-termination commissions for existing 3121 Cases and Special Pay Plan Cases\r\nthat is the basis of this lawsuit.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bencor sued VALIC for breach of\r\ncontract, declaratory judgment, and an accounting.<span>  </span>VALIC filed a motion for summary judgment\r\nasserting that res judicata barred Bencor’s claims because they had previously\r\nbeen litigated before the arbitration panel.<span> \r\n</span>The trial court granted VALIC’s motion for summary judgment, denied\r\nBencor’s motion for partial summary judgment, and dismissed all of Bencor’s\r\nclaims with prejudice.<span>  </span>The trial court\r\nlater vacated and re-entered summary judgment against Bencor, reserving the\r\nissue of attorney’s fees for trial.<span>  </span>The\r\nissue of attorney’s fees was tried to a jury, which awarded VALIC $200,122.50\r\nin fees plus conditional appellate fees.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On appeal, Bencor argues that the\r\ntrial court erred in granting VALIC’s motion for summary judgment and in\r\ndenying its motion for partial summary judgment.<span>  </span>Bencor also argues that VALIC was not\r\nentitled to fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act because the trial court’s\r\nruling on its motion for summary judgment mooted Bencor’s declaratory judgment\r\nclaim, that the fees assessed were unjust and inequitable, that the evidence\r\nwas insufficient to support the jury’s award of attorney’s fees, and that the\r\ntrial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on VALIC’s duty to segregate\r\nfees.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b><span><span>II.<span>              \r\n</span></span></span></b><b><span>Res judicata<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>VALIC argues that this lawsuit\r\ninvolves a claim for future damages that Bencor has already pleaded and proved\r\nbefore the arbitration panel.<span>  </span>It argues\r\nthat Bencor “is suing the same defendant under the same section of the same\r\ncontract [and] asserting the same breach and the same future damages,” which\r\ncould have been and were litigated, and for which Bencor has already received\r\nan award for damages.<span>  </span>Bencor contends\r\nthat the arbitration panel did not have jurisdiction over the claims involved\r\nin this lawsuit because they were unripe at the time of arbitration.<span>  </span>Bencor also argues that the principles of res\r\njudicata are inapplicable because the claims asserted before the arbitration\r\npanel were different from the claims asserted in this lawsuit, i.e., the claims\r\ninvolve different breaches of different compensation provisions in the\r\nmarketing agreement.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We
