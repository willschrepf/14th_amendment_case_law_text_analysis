The district court dismissed the case\n\naltogether. We reverse the district court’s order, except for the dismissal of certain\n\nclaims alleged against the Sheriff and the dismissal of the claim against the County\n\nfor deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious medical needs.\n\n       For the sufficiency of the complaint, the Supreme Court has given us this\n\nguidance: “a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless\n\n   1\n     The Supreme Court has set out the important policy considerations supporting the defense\nof qualified immunity for government officers sued for money damages in their individual\ncapacities. See e.g. Siegert v. Gilley, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793 (1991); Anderson v. Creighton, 107\nS.Ct. 3034, 3038 (1987); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2815 (1985); Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736 (1982) (qualified immunity helps protect government officials from\nexpenses of litigation, prevents diversion of energy from pressing public issues and alleviates\ndeterrent effect of threat of lawsuits on people’s acceptance of public office).\n        The basic law of this circuit for qualified immunity is set out in Lassiter v. Alabama A &\nM University, 28 F.3d 1146 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc). See Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of\nEduc., 115 F.3d 821, 823 (11th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (“The principles of qualified immunity set\nout in Lassiter v. Alabama A & M Univ., continue to be the guiding directives for deciding cases\ninvolving the question of a state actor’s entitlement to qualified immunity in this circuit”)\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n\n                                                2\n\fit appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n\nhis claim which would entitle him to relief.” Conley v. Gibson, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102\n\n(1957). A complaint is also subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when its\n\nallegations -- on their face -- show that an affirmative defense bars recovery on the\n\nclaim. See Quiller v. Barclays American/Credit, Inc., 727 F.2d 1067, 1069 (11th\n\nCir. 1984) vacated on petition for rehearing, reinstated by 764 F.2d 1400 (11th\n\nCir. 1985) (saying that complaint essentially is “self-defeating” when claim\n\nadequately stated but includes matters of avoidance that preclude pleader’s ability\n\nto recover, because plaintiff’s “own allegations show that the defense exists”); see\n\nalso, Oaxaca v. Roscoe, 641 F.2d 386, 391 (5th Cir. 1981) (saying that affirmative\n\ndefense alleging failure to bring Title VII claim to EEOC in timely fashion was\n\nproperly asserted in 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss); Kincheloe v. Farmer, 214 F.2d\n\n604, 605 (7th Cir. 1954) (when “allegations of [plaintiff’s] complaint erected [the\n\naffirmative defense]... it was his duty in order to extricate himself therefrom to\n\nplead any exceptions upon which he relied”); Larter & Sons, Inc. v. Dinkler Hotels\n\nCo., 199 F.2d 854, 855 (5th Cir. 1952) (holding that affirmative defense of res\n\njudicata can be raised properly and decided in12(b)(6) motion).\n\n      Once the affirmative defense of qualified immunity is advanced, the\n\nallegations of the complaint take on great importance in a lawsuit. “Unless the\n\n\n                                           3\n\fplaintiff’s allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a\n\ndefendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the\n\ncommencement of discovery.” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2815 (1985);\n\nBehrens v. Pelletier, 116 S.Ct. 834, 840 (1996) (“At the [12(b)(6)] stage, it is the\n\ndefendant’s conduct as alleged in the complaint that is scrutinized for ‘objective\n\nlegal reasonableness.’”). The Supreme Court has urged us to apply the affirmative\n\ndefense of qualified immunity at the earliest possible stage in litigation because the\n\ndefense is immunity from suit and not from damages only. See Hunter v. Bryant,\n\n112 S.Ct. 534, 536 (1991) (“[W]e repeatedly have stressed the importance of\n\nresolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in the litigation.”);\n\nMitchell, 105 S.Ct. at 2815 (entitlement of qualified immunity is “immunity from\n\nsuit rather than a mere defense to liability; and...is effectively lost if a case is\n\nerroneously permitted to go to trial”).\n\n       We have applied the qualified immunity defense at the 12(b)(6) stage before.\n\nSee, e.g., Chesser v. Sparks, 248 F.3d 1117, 1121 (11th Cir. 2001); Denno v.\n\nSchool Board of Volusia County, 218 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 2000); Kyle v.\n\nChapman, 208 F.3d 940, 943 (11th Cir. 2000); Maggio v. Sipple, 211 F.3d 1346,\n\n1355 (11th Cir. 2000) (reversing district court’s failure to grant 12(b)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss because defendants entitled to qualified immunity). We apply the qualified\n\n\n                                             4\n\fimmunity defense to dismiss a complaint at the 12(b)(6) stage where, (1) from the\n\nface of the complaint, (2) we must conclude that (even if a claim is otherwise\n\nsufficiently stated), (3) the law supporting the existence of that claim -- given the\n\nalleged circumstances -- was not already clearly established, (4) to prohibit what\n\nthe government-official defendant is alleged to have done, (5) before the defendant\n\nacted.\n\n         Two more points are worth mentioning preliminarily. The complaint was\n\ndrafted by lawyers. Plaintiffs have at all times been represented by legal counsel.\n\nIn addition, never in the district court did Plaintiffs seek to amend the complaint\n\n(for example, by adding facts), even after the complaint’s sufficiency had been\n\nspecifically challenged and the qualified immunity defense expressly advanced by\n\nopposing counsel and even after a recommendation to dismiss had been made by\n\nthe magistrate judge.\n\n         A complete copy of the complaint is made an appendix to this opinion.\n\nAccepting all well-pleaded factual allegations (with reasonable inferences drawn\n\nfavorably to Plaintiffs) in the complaint as true, we will summarize the\n\nallegations.2\n\n\n\n\n   2\n     A trial or other proceedings might show the actual facts to be different from the allegations\nset out here as “facts.”\n\n                                                 5\n\f                                      I. The Allegations\n\n\n\n       While incarcerated, Plaintiffs Joe Marsh (“Marsh”), a convicted inmate, and\n\nLeroy Owens (“Owens”), a pretrial detainee (together “Plaintiffs”) were assaulted\n\nand injured by other prisoners in the Butler County Jail (the “Jail”). Defendants\n\nButler County, Alabama, and the Butler County Commission were sued as the\n\ngovernment entities responsible under state law for properly maintaining, operating\n\nand funding the Jail.3 Defendant Diane Harris (the “Sheriff”), Sheriff of Butler\n\nCounty, was sued in her individual and official capacities as the party responsible\n\nunder state law for the Jail’s general supervision and control.4 The Sheriff has\n\n   3\n     The Butler County Commission is the governing body of Butler County; so the liability\nanalyses for the two entities are identical. They will be referred to together as the “County” for\nthe remainder of the opinion.\n   4\n     A reader of the complaint may wonder if the complaint actually purports to sue the Sheriff\nin her individual capacity. It does not.\n        According to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), a complaint must contain, “1) a short and plain\nstatement of the grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depends, unless the court already\nhas jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, 2) a short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and 3) a demand for\njudgment for the relief the pleader seeks.”\n        In this case, that part of the complaint which purports to state the claim against Harris\ndoes specifically address the capacity in which the Sheriff is sued. It says these words about\ncapacity: “Defendant Diane Harris is sued in her official capacity as Sheriff of Butler County.”\nThus, the complaint’s “statement of a claim” does not purport to make a claim against the Sheriff\nin her individual capacity.\n        The caption to the complaint contains these words: “Diane Harris, Sheriff of Butler\nCounty, in her individual and official capacity.” But the caption of the complaint is not part of\nthe statement of the claim under Rule 8. The caption is something apart, being mandated by a\ndifferent rule: Fed. R. Civ. P. 10. The caption is chiefly for the court’s administrative\nconvenience. It may, however, sometimes be useful to look at the caption -- when the Rule 8\n\n                                                 6\n\facted as the final policymaker of Butler County for those aspects of jail operation\n\nunder her control.\n\n        In Counts I and II of the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’\n\ndeliberate indifference to the unreasonably dangerous conditions at the Jail\n\ndeprived Plaintiffs of their Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights\n\nunder the United States Constitution. In Count III of the Complaint, Owens claims\n\nthat Defendants’ deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs deprived him\n\nof his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.5\n\n\nstatement of a claim is ambiguous about a party’s capacity -- to settle pleading ambiguities. See\nHobbs v. E.E. Roberts, 999 F.2d 1526, 1529-30 (11th Cir. 1993) (using several factors, including\ncaption, to resolve ambiguity of whether official sued in official or individual capacity). To use\nthe Rule 10 caption to create an ambiguity when the statement of the claim is itself not\nambiguous is incorrect.\n         Nevertheless, we accept this case and will decide this case as one in which the complaint\npurports to sue the Sheriff in both her official and individual capacities. The reason is that, in the\ndistrict court, the parties and the district judge clearly litigated the case in that way. The Sheriff,\nfrom the start, advanced the defense of qualified immunity: a defense that is valid only against\nclaims asserted against a government official in her individual capacity. Never did the Sheriff\nchallenge the complaint on the specific ground that it did not even purport to assert a claim\nagainst her except in her official capacity. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b), “[w]hen issues not\nraised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be\ntreated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.” Although Rule 15 uses the\nword “tried,” we accept Rule 15(b) as a guide -- by way of analogy, at the appellate level --\nfor cases never tried, but litigated on motions.\n   5\n     Marsh was a convicted criminal at the Jail and therefore entitled to Eighth Amendment\nprotection. Owens, however, was a pretrial detainee, to whom the Eighth Amendment does not\napply. See Tittle v. Jefferson County Comm’n., 10 F.3d 1535, 1539 n.3 (11th Cir. 1994) (en\nbanc) (citing Ingraham v. Wright, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1412-13 n.40 (1977)). Plaintiffs mentioned --\nbut did not argue -- in a footnote in their brief to the panel that it is not altogether plain that the\nsubjective deliberate-indifference standard applies in Fourteenth Amendment cases for pretrial\ndetainees. See generally Tallahassee Mem’l Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Brown, 815 F.2d 1435, 1445\nn.16 (11th Cir. 1987) (single footnote in appellant’s brief is not enough to present issue) . The\n\n                                                   7\n\f       The Jail was an old building that had become extremely dilapidated by the\n\nsummer of 1996. Inmates were able to obtain makeshift weapons by cannibalizing\n\nparts of the decaying building. Lack of adequate monitoring of the inmates\n\nallowed inmate activities to go mostly unchecked. Locks to the doors of the\n\ninmates’ cells did not work, resulting in the inability of the guards to lock down the\n\nprisoners. Because prisoners were never locked down, jailers were afraid to\n\nconduct visual inspections of inmate cells on the second floor; most of the inmate\n\npopulation was kept on the second floor. No visual or audio surveillance system\n\nwas in place on the second floor Nor, did prisoners have means to contact guards\n\nother than by screaming or banging on the walls. Jailers never conducted prisoner\n\nheadcounts.\n\n       Often, only one jailer was on duty at the Jail at a time. This single jailer was\n\nresponsible for controlling the entire inmate population, administering inmate\n\npanel decided the case as essentially an Eighth Amendment case. Marsh v. Butler County, 225\nF.3d 1243, 1256 n.6 (11th Cir. 2000). In the en banc brief, Plaintiffs, in a couple of sentences,\nmention the issue of possible differences between the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; but\nPlaintiffs do not argue the point. We have said that the standard for providing basic human\nneeds to those incarcerated or in detention is the same under both the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. See Hamm v. DeKalb Cty., 774 F.2d 1567, 1573-74 (11th Cir. 1985)); Lancaster\nv. Monroe Cty., 116 F.3d 1419, 1425 n.6 (11th Cir. 1997) (minimum standard for providing\nmedical care to pretrial detainee under Fourteenth Amendment is same as minimum standard\nrequired under Eighth Amendment for convicted prisoner). Given the lack of argument, we do\nnot consider or decide en banc whether or how the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment standards\ndiffer. See generally Tapley v. Collins, 211 F.3d 1210, 1217 n.10 (11th Cir. 2000) (nature of\nbriefing impacts on court’s discretion to decide issues). We accept our precedents treating the\nAmendments as the same in the context of incarceration. We will refer to the Amendments\ninterchangeably, most often referring to the Eighth.\n\n                                                8\n\fintake and release, controlling the gate and fence surrounding the Jail, supervising\n\nvisitation and outdoor exercise, handling mail, coordinating food service,\n\ndispensing medication, supervising trustees, answering the Jail telephone, and (at\n\ntimes) answering calls to the Butler County Sheriff’s Department and operating the\n\ndispatch radio. Because the Jail was understaffed, inmate trustees were given\n\nmany responsibilities for taking care of other inmates and maintaining the\n\noperation of the Jail.\n\n      In August 1995, the jail inspector for the Alabama Department of\n\nCorrections recommended that all Butler County jailers be trained in jail-\n\nmanagement seminars. By the time of the incidents underlying the complaint, few\n\njailers had been so trained. Written procedures did not govern the Jail’s\n\noperations.\n\n      Inmates entering the Jail were not screened for mental impairments or for\n\nwhether they had conflicts with other inmates in the Jail. No system of\n\nclassification existed at the Jail: pretrial detainees were housed with convicted\n\ninmates, nonviolent offenders with violent offenders, juveniles with adults, and\n\nmentally ill persons with those in good mental health. Never were prisoners\n\ndisciplined or segregated for assaulting other inmates, destroying jail property, or\n\nthreatening jailers. The Jail contained four eight-person cells, one four-person cell,\n\n\n                                          9\n\ftrustee cells, two holding cells, one isolation cell and a cell for female inmates; but\n\nsometimes more than 50 inmates were imprisoned at the Jail.\n\n      Jail Administrator Thelma Teague (“Teague”) told the Sheriff several times\n\nthat the Jail needed more staff. In February 1996, the jail inspector for the\n\nAlabama Department of Corrections informed Defendants that the Jail was not\n\nreasonably secure. Defendants also received many complaints and requests for\n\nassistance from prisoners. A letter from prisoner-rights advocates told Defendants\n\nthat the Jail conditions posed “an immediate and serious threat to the safety of the\n\ninmates” and made inmates “highly vulnerable to assault by other inmates.”\n\n      On 2 July 1996, four inmates assaulted Joe Marsh in his cell. He was struck\n\nin the head with a metal pipe, beaten for several minutes, and cut with a\n\nscrewdriver. During the assault other inmates yelled and banged on the walls\n\nattempting to get the attention of jailers. No jailer came upstairs until 10 to 15\n\nminutes after the assault ended. Marsh suffered lacerations across his forehead, on\n\nthe back of his head and on his back. The bone above his eyebrow was broken.\n\nMarsh was taken to a hospital where he received medical treatment for his injuries.\n\nHis left eye now droops, and he has nerve damage in his forehead as a result of the\n\nassault. He continues to suffer from frequent headaches and nightmares.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      The four attackers were never disciplined for the assault on Marsh. Two\n\ndays later (and after the attack on Owens) one of the four attackers discharged a\n\nfire extinguisher into Marsh’s cell where he was resting, nearly suffocating him.\n\n      Owens, a paranoid schizophrenic, was a pretrial detainee who was placed in\n\nthe general population at the Jail. On 3 July 1996, the same four inmates who\n\nassaulted Marsh attacked Owens.\n\n      Owens was attacked in the dayroom on the second floor. He was hit in the\n\nhead with a metal pipe and hit with a watercooler. His head was smashed into a\n\ntable, and he was kicked, stomped, stabbed and beaten for 30 minutes to an hour.\n\nOther inmates called for the jailer to assist Owens. During the assault, the\n\nattackers returned to their cells when they suspected a jailer was on the way. When\n\nthe attackers realized that no help for their victim was coming, they returned to the\n\ndayroom to continue the assault.\n\n      When the assault started, only one jailer was on duty. When he heard the\n\ncries for help he called the Greenville City Police. When the police arrived, they\n\nrefused to go onto the second floor. The jailer called the Sheriff and Jail\n\nAdministrator Teague, but both refused to come to the Jail. Chief Deputy Hartley\n\n(“Hartley”) was called and did come to the Jail.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Twenty minutes after the assault ended, Hartley walked upstairs and brought\n\nOwens downstairs. Owens was taken to a hospital shortly after midnight on 4 July.\n\nHis injuries were treated. Owens was discharged from the hospital to the care of\n\nthe Butler County Sheriff’s Department. Two deputies signed a discharge sheet\n\nwhich instructed them to monitor Owens’s level of consciousness, pupils, vision,\n\nand coordination, and to call the hospital immediately if a change occurred. Back\n\nat the Jail, Hartley instructed Owens to sign his own bond, pursuant to Defendants’\n\npolicy and custom of releasing sick or injured inmates. Hartley then drove Owens\n\nto a motel near the I-65 interstate highway and released him. Owens’s clothes\n\nwere bloody, and he was in his bare feet. The clerks at the motel refused to rent\n\nhim a room and called the police. The police officer who responded to the call\n\nfollowed Owens as he wandered across the I-65 overpass and then ordered the\n\nclerk another motel to rent Owens a room.\n\n      Owens awoke the next day in terrible pain and called his grandmother’s\n\nhouse. His sisters came to the motel where Owens had spent the night. An\n\nambulance was called, and Owens returned to the hospital where a doctor\n\nprescribed pain medication. Because of the assault at the Jail, Owens still\n\nexperiences pain and limited mobility in his right shoulder and uncontrollable\n\nshaking in his right arm.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                         II.    Proceedings in the District Court\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs filed their complaint in 1997. Without filing an answer,\n\nDefendants filed their motions to dismiss. The Sheriff’s motion, among other\n\nthings, asserted qualified immunity. Plaintiffs filed responses to the motions. The\n\nmagistrate judge made his recommendations to grant Defendants’ motions to\n\ndismiss. Plaintiffs filed their objections to the magistrate’s recommendations with\n\nthe district court. The district court adopted, approved and affirmed the magistrate\n\njudge’s recommendations and granted the County’s and the Sheriff’s motions to\n\ndismiss.\n\n\n\n                 III. Claims Against The County for Jail Conditions6\n\n\n\n\n   6\n     We address the claims against the County in detail only for the conditions of confinement.\nPlaintiffs also allege deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious medical needs based on his\nrelease. They make this claim against Defendants in general, which would seem to include the\nCounty. Nothing indicates, however, that the County was involved in the alleged deprivation of\nmedical care to Owens. Moreover, under Alabama law the County is not responsible for\nassuring procedures are in place for inmates to get medical care. Alabama law assigns counties a\n“limited role in building and funding the jails.” See Turquitt v. Jefferson Cty., Ala., 137 F.3d\n1285, 1290 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc). Therefore, the County is not a responsible party for the\nalleged tort of deliberate indifference to Owens’s medical needs. This claim was properly\ndismissed against the County. Therefore, this opinion will address the deliberate-indifference-\nto-serious-medical-needs claim (Count III) only in the context of the Sheriff’s liability.\n\n                                              13\n\f       The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The\n\nSupreme Court says that prison officials will be liable for violating the Eighth\n\nAmendment when they are deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of serious\n\nharm to inmates. Put differently, officials, to be liable, must be aware of a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the inmates and not take reasonable measures to\n\nalleviate that risk. See Farmer v. Brennan, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1982-83 (1994).\n\n       A local government can be directly responsible for a constitutional violation\n\ndue to its acts or omissions. See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 106 S.Ct. 1292,\n\n1298 (1986) (“a municipality may be liable under section 1983 for a single\n\ndecision by its legislative body...”) (citing Owen v. City of Independence, 100\n\nS.Ct. 1398 (1980); Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 101 S.Ct. 2748 (1981)). A local\n\ngovernment, however, will be liable under section 1983 only for acts for which the\n\nlocal government is actually responsible. Turquitt v. Jefferson Cty., Ala., 137 F.3d\n\n1285, 1287 (11th Cir. 1998). Alabama counties have no responsibility for daily\n\noperation of county jails and no authority to dictate how jails are run, but the\n\nCounty is charged with erecting and maintaining jails.7 Id. at 1289-90. Therefore,\n\n   7\n     The County has the duty to construct and to maintain a jail of sufficient size and strength to\nhouse the inmates. See Ala.Code §§ 11-14-10, 11-14-13 (1989). Looking to Alabama case law\nto define the County’s responsibilities under the statute, we see that “the [Alabama] legislature\nintended to require the county commission to keep a jail and all equipment therein in a state of\nrepair to preserve it from failure or decline.” Keeton v. Fayette Cty., 558 So.2d 884, 886\n(Ala.1990) (summary judgment for County improper when Plaintiff alleged negligence in\nCounty’s maintenance of jail); cf. Turquitt, 137 F.3d at 1290 (en banc) (concluding no county\n\n                                                14\n\fthe County will have violated Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights if its failure to\n\nmaintain the Jail constituted deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm to the prisoners.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege in the complaint that the physical conditions of the Jail, the\n\nmaintenance of which was the County’s responsibility, presented an objective\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the inmates. They allege the locks on the doors\n\nto cells did not work, preventing inmates from being locked down. The structure\n\nof the Jail was so dilapidated that inmates could fashion weapons from pieces of\n\nthe building. And no video or audio surveillance system was in place to check on\n\nthe inmates.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that the County was aware of the conditions. Plaintiffs say\n\nthese things put the County on notice: a report from the Alabama Department of\n\nCorrections filed in February 1996; faultfinding inspection reports from several\n\nstate agencies; complaints from prisoners; a letter (outlining dangerous conditions)\n\nfrom a prisoner-rights advocacy organization; and a complaint filed in a lawsuit on\n\n14 May 1996, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the prisoners\n\nin the Jail.\n\n\n\nliability for improper operations of the jail). Under Alabama law, a county might be liable when\nthe physical conditions of the jail have deteriorated and pose a serious threat to the safety of\ninmates and when those conditions have caused the injury to the inmates.\n\n                                               15\n\f      We accept that conditions in a jail facility that allow prisoners ready access\n\nto weapons, fail to provide an ability to lock down inmates, and fail to allow for\n\nsurveillance of inmates pose a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates. In\n\naddition, Plaintiffs’ allegations that the County received many reports of the\n\nconditions but took no remedial measures is sufficient to allege deliberate\n\nindifference to the substantial risk of serious harm faced by inmates in the Jail.\n\n      Plaintiffs’ complaint also properly alleges the causal connection between the\n\nCounty’s failure to maintain the Jail and the assaults on Marsh and Owens. For\n\nexample, that the locks on the doors to cells did not work prevented the isolation of\n\nprisoners from each other and gave attackers ready access to Plaintiffs. We\n\nconclude that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a constitutional violation by Butler\n\nCounty to survive the County’s motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n                       IV. The Claims Against Sheriff Harris\n\n\n\nA. Official-Capacity Claims Against the Sheriff\n\n\n\n      Authority over inmates is expressly granted to Alabama Sheriffs. See\n\nTurquitt, 137 F.3d at 1289 (saying “the sheriff has control over the inmates in the\n\n\n                                          16\n\fjail, the employees of the jail, and the jail itself” and the “sheriff [] has the duty to\n\nensure that inmates do not come to harm” (citing Ala. Code § 14-6-1)). The\n\nauthority the Sheriff has over the Jail is totally independent of the county\n\ncommission; so, the “sheriff acts exclusively for the state rather than for the county\n\nin operating a county jail.” Id. at 1288. For this reason, Alabama sheriffs are\n\nconsidered arms of the state and protected by sovereign immunity in suits against\n\nthem in their official capacity. The complaint against the Sheriff in her official\n\ncapacity was thus properly dismissed. The Sheriff can be subject to suit only in her\n\nindividual capacity, to which she might be entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\nB.    Individual-Capacity Claims Against Sheriff Harris for Conditions at the Jail\n      (Counts I and II)\n\n\n      To overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity, Plaintiffs must allege conditions that, in the light of the already clearly\n\nestablished law at the time of the incident, obviously amounted to cruel and\n\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. In the qualified immunity\n\nanalysis, we generally first determine whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for a\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fconstitutional violation at all. See Stanley v. City of Dalton, 219 F.3d 1280, 1285\n\n(11th Cir. 2000).\n\n       A prison official’s deliberate indifference to a known, substantial risk of\n\nserious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment. See Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 2480 (1993). An Eighth Amendment violation will\n\noccur when a substantial risk of serious harm, of which the official is subjectively\n\naware, exists and the official does not “respond[] reasonably to the risk.” Farmer\n\nv. Brennan, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1982-83 (1994). A plaintiff must also show that the\n\nconstitutional violation caused his injuries.\n\n       In Farmer, the Court was chiefly concerned with defining the level of intent\n\nrequired of an official to violate the Eighth Amendment -- the subjective element\n\nof the tort; but Farmer also explained that two objective elements are part of an\n\nEighth Amendment violation. First, an objectively substantial risk of serious harm\n\nto prisoners must exist. See Id. at 1977. Second, once it is established that the\n\nofficial is aware of this substantial risk, the official must react to this risk in an\n\nobjectively unreasonable manner. See Id. at 1983.\n\n       In this case, Plaintiffs allege these conditions at the Jail: 1) there was no\n\nsegregation of nonviolent inmates from violent inmates, pretrial detainees from\n\nconvicted criminals, juveniles from adults, or inmates with mental disorders from\n\n\n                                            18\n\fthose without mental disorders, 2) at times the Jail housed more prisoners than the\n\ncells could accommodate, 3) the Jail was routinely understaffed, 4) no head counts\n\nof prisoners were made to make sure they were all accounted for, 5) locks on cell\n\ndoors were not functional, allowing inmates to roam freely at all hours of the day,\n\n6) homemade weapons were readily available by fashioning weapons from\n\nmaterial torn from the dilapidated structure of the Jail, 7) no lock down of\n\nprisoners in their cells occurred at any point during the day or night, 8) cells were\n\nnot visually inspected, 9) no jailer was assigned to maintain prisoners’ security on\n\nthe second floor where most of the inmates were housed, 10) the Jail was not\n\noperated in accordance with written policies, 11) inmates were not screened for\n\nmental health, medical conditions or conflicts with other prisoners before entering\n\nthe Jail, and 12) prisoners were not disciplined or segregated when they attempted\n\nto escape, threatened jailers, destroyed property or assaulted other inmates.\n\n      Taken as a whole, these alleged conditions, if true, present an objectively\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm -- including the risk of inmate-on-inmate attacks --\n\nto inmates. This risk violates the Eighth Amendment’s requirement “that inmates\n\nbe furnished with basic human needs, one of which is ‘reasonable safety.’”\n\nHelling, 113 S.Ct. at 2480-81 (quoting DeShaney v. Winnebego, 109 S.Ct. 998,\n\n1005 (1989)).\n\n\n                                          19\n\f      Plaintiffs also allege that Harris was aware of the risk: she was provided\n\nwith faultfinding, inspection reports by state agencies, reports outlining the\n\nconditions that existed at the Jail; with many complaints from prisoners and\n\nrequests for assistance; with correspondence from prisoners’ lawyers detailing the\n\nstaffing problems and warning of a “serious threat to the safety of inmates”; and\n\nwith a lawsuit filed in the district court in May 1996, seeking injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief on behalf of the inmates at the Jail. In addition, the conditions at\n\nthe Jail are alleged to be longstanding and pervasive. These allegations are\n\nsufficient to plead that the Sheriff was subjectively aware of the substantial risk to\n\ninmate safety at the Jail. See Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1979 (“[T]he official must both\n\nbe aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”).\n\n      Still, a prison official will only violate the Eighth Amendment if the\n\nofficial’s response to the conditions posing the substantial risk of serious harm is\n\nunreasonable. See Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1982-83. Plaintiffs allege that Harris did\n\nabsolutely nothing to alleviate the conditions at the Jail, despite repeated warnings\n\nand recommendations for how conditions could be improved. This alleged lack of\n\naction is not reasonable under the alleged circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f          Plaintiffs also allege that the dangerous conditions caused their injuries.\n\nConditions, like those in this case, where violent prisoners are allowed free reign of\n\na jail with easy access to weapons without proper supervision by guards could be\n\nfound to have caused the assaults on Plaintiffs.\n\n          We conclude that Plaintiffs adequately allege 1) an objective, substantial risk\n\nof serious harm to inmates existed, 2) the Sheriff was subjectively aware of this\n\nrisk, 3) the Sheriff responded in an objectively unreasonable way to this known\n\nrisk, and 4) the constitutional violation caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. Plaintiffs,\n\ntherefore, allege sufficiently that Sheriff Harris violated their Eighth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n          But, the Sheriff, in her individual capacity, might be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity -- barring Plaintiffs’ suit against her -- even if the complaint states an\n\notherwise valid claim for an Eighth Amendment violation.8 See Lassiter v.\n\n   8\n       “A claim of immunity is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff’s claim that\nhis rights have been violated.” Mitchell, 105 S. Ct. at 2816; Saucier v. Katz, 121 S.Ct. 2151,\n2154 (2001) (ruling on qualified immunity requires a separate analysis “not susceptible of fusion\nwith the question of whether there was [a constitutional violation]”). For example, as we have\njust discussed, if a sheriff responds reasonably to unsafe jail conditions, the sheriff will avoid\nliability on the merits of an Eighth Amendment claim. But, in addition, if a sheriff responds in\nan arguably reasonable way to unsafe jail conditions, the sheriff will avoid suit pursuant to the\ndefense of qualified immunity. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149 (“Unless a government agent’s act\nis so obviously wrong, in the light of preexisting law, that only a plainly incompetent officer or\none who was knowingly violating the law would have done such a thing, the government actor\nhas immunity from suit.”) (citing Malley v. Briggs, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1096-97 (1986)); cf. Post v.\nCity of Fort Lauderdale, 7 F.3d 1552, 1558 (11th Cir. 1993) (“When an officer asserts qualified\nimmunity, the issue is not whether probable cause existed in fact, but whether the officer had\n‘arguable’ probable cause to arrest.”).\n\n                                                  21\n\fAlabama A & M Univ., 28 F.3d 1146, 1151 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc)(saying\n\n“[i]mmunity contemplates exemption from liability that would otherwise exist on\n\nthe merits”). A government-officer defendant is entitled to qualified immunity\n\nunless, at the time of the incident, the “preexisting law dictates, that is, truly\n\ncompel[s],” the conclusion for all reasonable, similarly situated public officials that\n\nwhat Defendant was doing violated Plaintiffs’ federal rights in the circumstances.\n\nId. at 1150.\n\n         Government officials are not required to err on the side of caution. See Davis v. Scherer,\n104 S.Ct. 3012, 3020 (1984). And qualified immunity recognizes “the need to protect officials\nwho are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the\nvigorous exercise of official authority.” Butz v. Economou, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2911 (1978).\nQualified immunity is meant to allow government officials to act with “independence and\nwithout fear of consequences” when the law is not clearly established. Id. at 2739.\n         Take a complaint’s facts as true. If reasonable people could disagree about whether a\nsheriff -- in the light of the then clearly established law -- responded reasonably to the\ncomplaint’s alleged circumstances, qualified immunity must apply: the sheriff has responded in\nan arguably reasonable way. The plaintiff’s allegations on their face show that relief against the\nofficial, in his individual capacity, is barred by the defense of qualified immunity. The law\napplicable to the alleged circumstances facing the official was not already clearly established,\nthat is, a reasonable government official could not truly know when he acted whether the acts\nwere lawful or unlawful under the federal law. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 102 S. Ct. at 2738\n(official could not “fairly be said to ‘know’ that the law forbade conduct not previously\nidentified as unlawful” when law not clearly established).\n         For a court to conclude that -- in the light of the clearly established law at the pertinent\ntime -- a hypothetical jury, considering all the complaint’s alleged facts as true, could decide that\nthe defendant responded unreasonably is not sufficient to overcome the qualified immunity\ndefense raised in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. This formulation is nothing more than saying that\nreasonable people might or might not think -- this is, could disagree about whether -- the\ngovernment actor behaved unreasonably. It is this kind of situation -- that is, one where the\nalleged facts (accepted as true) leave the legal consequences uncertain -- for which the defense\nof qualified immunity was designed.\n         In Hill v. DeKalb Regional Yourth Detention Center, 40 F.3d 1176, 1186 (11th Cir.\n1994), we see some dicta: “a finding of deliberate indifference necessarily precludes a finding of\nqualified immunity”. We reject that dicta because it incorrectly jumbles the merits of an Eighth\nAmendment violation with the separate concept of an immunity defense.\n\n                                                 22\n\f       When looking at the preexisting case law, courts, dealing with qualified\n\nimmunity defenses, must always keep in mind the great distinction between\n\nfollowing a precedent and extending a precedent. Two sets of circumstances may\n\nbe “nearly” the same, but “nearly” can make a great legal difference at the edge.\n\nBecause fair and clear notice to government officials is the cornerstone of qualified\n\nimmunity, courts must diligently analyze the preexisting case law to determine\n\nwhether it really did provide plain notice to every reasonable government official\n\nthat the pertinent conduct, in the specific circumstances, would clearly violate\n\npreexisting federal law.\n\n       The deliberate indifference standard of the Eighth Amendment basically\n\nplaces a duty on jailers to act reasonably to keep inmates safe. A “duty-to-act-\n\nreasonably” standard, by itself, is almost always too general a proposition to give\n\nmeaningful notice to a public official that what he, in the specific circumstances, is\n\ndoing violates established federal law.9 See generally, Stornelli v. United States\n\n\n   9\n     We acknowledge that preexisting case law, tied to the precise facts, is not in every situation\nessential to establish clearly the law applying to the circumstances facing a public official so that\na reasonable official would be put on fair and clear notice that specific conduct would be\nunlawful in the faced, specific circumstances. See United States v. Lanier, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1227\n(1997) (“[A] general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with\nobvious clarity to the specific conduct in question.”) (discussing 18 U.S.C. § 242); Lassiter, 28\nF.3d at 1150 n.4 (leaving open possibility that “occasionally the words of a federal statute or\nfederal constitutional provision will be specific enough to establish the law applicable to\nparticular circumstances clearly and to overcome qualified immunity even in the absence of case\nlaw”); Preister v. City of Riviera Beach, 208 F.3d 919, 926 (11th Cir. 2000) (recognizing narrow\nexception of not requiring preexisting case law when “the official’s conduct ‘was so far beyond\n\n                                                 23\n\fGypsum Co., 134 F.2d 461, 462 (2nd Circuit 1943) (Learned Hand, J.) (where the\n\ncourt was comparing jury’s responsibility in applying specific duty imposed by\n\n\nthe hazy border’ between constitutional and unconstitutional conduct, that the official had to\nknow he was violating the Constitution [the Fourth Amendment] even without caselaw on\npoint”) (quoting Smith v. Mattox, 127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir. 1997)).\n         Some general statements of law are capable of giving fair and clear warning in some\ncircumstances: the occasional “obvious clarity” cases per Lanier. But in other cases, as Lanier\nsays, “a very high degree of prior factual particularity may be necessary.” 117 S.Ct. at 1227.\nEspecially where the applicable legal standard is a highly general one, such as “to act\nreasonably” or “to act with probable cause,” preexisting case law, that has applied the general\nlaw to specific circumstances, will almost always be necessary to draw the bright line that is\ncapable of honestly giving fair and clear notice that an official’s conduct will violate federal law.\nSee Anderson, 107 S.Ct. at 3040 (noting that pertinent qualified immunity question in probable-\ncause case is “fact-specific” question of whether a reasonable official could have believed, in\nlight of clearly established law, that official’s behavior was lawful under circumstances);\nLassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150 (en banc) (stating that “general propositions” have little to do with\nqualified immunity, and the bright line that must be crossed to surrender qualified immunity “is\nnot found in abstractions -- to act reasonably, to act with probable cause, and so forth -- but in\nstudying how these abstractions have been applied in concrete circumstances”) (quoting Barts,\n865 F.2d at 1194); Adams v. St. Lucie Sheriff’s Dept., 962 F.2d 1563, 1573, 1575 (Edmondson,\nJ., dissenting) approved en banc, 998 F.2d 923 (11th Cir. 1993) (“[w]hen considering whether\nthe law applicable to certain facts is clearly established, the facts of the cases relied upon as\nprecedent are important. The facts need not be the same as the facts of the immediate case. But\nthey do need to be materially similar.”); Jenkins, 115 F.3d at 826 (reasonableness standard was\nnot principle that provided adequate warning because that general standard could not apply with\n“obvious clarity” to concrete circumstances faced by school officials). See also Saucier v. Katz,\n121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156 (2001) (“This inquiry [whether a legal right was already clearly\nestablished], it is vital to note, must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not\nas a broad general proposition”); Wilson v. Layne, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1699-70 (1999) (saying “the\nright allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity....”). Thus, in the\npresent case, when we have denied qualified immunity, we have done so because we believe that\nfact-specific, preexisting case law did put reasonable sheriffs on clear notice given the alleged\ncircumstances.\n         The defense of qualified immunity bars absolutely a judge and jury from making, in\neffect, new law for a case to fit the particular circumstances that faced the public official at the\ntime of the pertinent event and then applying this new law basically retroactively in the case to\nmake an award of damages. If a public official is to be punished by an imposition of damages\nagainst him personally, the punishment must be for violating some clear, legal duty he – in the\nlight of the specific circumstances before him – plainly already had at the time of the pertinent\nevent, and not for violating what is, in effect, some new legal duty recognized or announced by\nthe judge and jury in the official’s trial, long after the time of the pertinent event.\n\n                                                  24\n\fstatute to that imposed by common law duty to take reasonable care saying “[i]t is\n\ntrue we think of the common-law duty as though it were imposed before the event,\n\nbecause it demands only <reasonable’ care; but that does not specify the conduct\n\nrequired and creates a duty incapable of being known in advance, and it is\n\nascertained and imposed only retroactively...it is legislation in parvo [in little]”).\n\n      When the facts of previous precedents are necessary to give clear warning\n\nthat certain conduct in specific circumstances will violate federal law, we must\n\nlook at the facts in the precedent and at the facts that confronted the government\n\nofficial in the case before the court. The two sets of facts must be materially\n\nsimilar. For qualified immunity purposes, a preexisting precedent is materially\n\nsimilar to the circumstances facing an official when the specific circumstances\n\nfacing the official are enough like the facts in the precedent that no reasonable,\n\nsimilarly-situated official could believe that the factual differences between the\n\nprecedent and the circumstances facing the official might make a difference to the\n\nconclusion about whether the official’s conduct was lawful or unlawful, in the light\n\nof the precedent. Thus, every fact need not be identical. But minor variations in\n\nsome facts (the precedent lacks an arguably significant fact or contains an\n\nadditional arguably significant fact not in the circumstances now facing the\n\nofficial) might be very important and, therefore, be able to make the circumstances\n\n\n                                           25\n\ffacing an official materially different from the preexisting precedents, leaving the\n\nlaw applicable -- in the circumstances facing the official -- not clearly established\n\nwhen the defendant official acted.\n\n        To apply properly this “materially similar” principle, the court, surveying\n\nthe relevant area of law, must discern the facts that were material to the federal law\n\nviolation in similar preexisting cases.10 These facts then must be compared to the\n\nfacts alleged in the case before the court. If there is an absence of a fact (or the\n\npresence of an additional fact) in the case before the court, the court must\n\ndetermine whether that fact might make a difference to any reasonable official who\n\nhad to determine whether his conduct violated federal law in the circumstances in\n\nthe immediate case. If the court determines that the variance might make a\n\ndifference, the precedent -- when factual particularity is needed to establish the\n\nlaw -- cannot clearly establish the law applicable to the circumstances facing the\n\ndefendant.\n\n\n\n\n   10\n      When case law is needed to “clearly establish” the law applicable to the pertinent\ncircumstances, we look to decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the highest court of the pertinent state. See Jenkins, 115\nF.3d at 827 n.4. We do not understand Wilson v. Layne, 119 S.Ct. 1692 (1999), to have held\nthat a “consensus of cases of persuasive authority” from other courts would be able to establish\nthe law clearly. Id. at 1700. Each jurisdiction has its own body of law, and splits between\njurisdictions on matters of law are not uncommon. We do not expect public officials to sort out\nthe law of every jurisdiction in the country.\n\n                                               26\n\f        The district court in this case concluded the preexisting law was not clearly\n\nestablished, at the pertinent time, that the conditions at the Jail posed a substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm to prisoners in the Jail. The district court recognized the\n\ntroubling conditions at the Jail; but the district court seemed to conclude that,\n\nbecause this case presented no allegations of past serious injuries to prisoners at the\n\nJail, the preexisting case law was too different from this case to have clearly\n\nestablished the law applicable to the alleged circumstances. We think the district\n\ncourt erred.\n\n        We accept that at least three of our decisions did clearly establish, at the\n\npertinent time, that the conditions of confinement Plaintiffs allege did pose a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to inmates. See Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50\n\nF.3d 1579 (11th Cir. 1995); Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d 1206 (5th Cir. 1977);\n\nGates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974).11 These cases contained facts on\n\nthe conditions of confinement very similar to the facts alleged in this case on the\n\nconditions of confinement.12\n\n   11\n     In Bonner v. City of Pritchard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court\nadopted all decisions of the Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on 30\nSeptember 1981 as binding precedent in this circuit.\n   12\n      In Hale, evidence was presented of these conditions: 1) prisoners were not segregated\nbased on their proclivity for violence, 2) there was only one jailer on duty, 3) the jailer’s quarters\nwere out of earshot and eyesight of the prisoners’ cell, and 4) fights occurred between inmates\non a regular basis resulting in injuries requiring medical attention and hospitalization. In\nWilliams, the court concluded that the totality of the circumstances posed a substantial risk of\n\n                                                 27\n\f       It is true that each of these earlier cases also had, as part of the facts, that the\n\npertinent institution had a history of inmate assaults with serious injuries. And this\n\ncase lacks that alleged fact. But that factual variance cannot make a difference. As\n\nthe Supreme Court had written (before the Plaintiffs were injured in the case), an\n\nEighth Amendment violation can arise from unsafe conditions of confinement even\n\nif no assault or similar physical injury has yet occurred. See Helling, 113 S.Ct. at\n\n2481 (Eighth Amendment protects against sufficiently imminent dangers as well as\n\ncurrent unnecessary and wanton infliction of harm); see also Collier, 501 F.2d at\n\n1300-01 (concluding that risk to inmates posed by exposed electrical wiring,\n\ndeficient firefighting measures and mingling of inmates with contagious diseases\n\nconstituted Eighth Amendment violation even though no showing was made that\n\n\nserious harm due to inmate violence. The circumstances in the prison showed this environment:\n1) widespread possession of weapons, 2) no confiscation of weapons, 3) no segregation of\nviolent from nonviolent inmates, 4) previous assaults, 5) overcrowding, 6) too few guards to\nsupervise properly inmates, and 7) multiple reports of stabbing, some resulting in death. In\nCollier, the court concluded that these conditions pose a serious risk of harm to inmates: 1)\npossession of weapons by prisoners, 2) no established procedure for confiscating weapons, 3)\nlack of classification according to severity of offense, 4) no procedure for reporting previous\nassaults, 5) overcrowding, 6) lack of supervision by guards, 7) custodial responsibility assigned\nto incompetent and untrained inmates, and 8) at least 27 reported instances of armed assaults by\ninmates on other inmates.\n        In this case, Plaintiffs allege these things: 1) widespread possession of weapons by\ninmates, 2) weapons were not confiscated from prisoners, 3) no segregation of nonviolent\ninmates from violent inmates, pretrial detainees from convicted criminals, juveniles from adults,\nor inmates with mental disorders from those without mental disorders, 4) no discipline of\ninmates for violent behavior and previous assaults on other inmates, 5) at times the Jail housed\nmore prisoners than the cells could accommodate, 6) the Jail was understaffed, 7) inadequate\nsupervision by jailers, and 8) unsupervised prisoner trustees had custodial duties for other\nprisoners.\n\n                                               28\n\fprisoners had been injured or had contracted disease due to these conditions). See\n\ngenerally Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1983 (relief available to plaintiff subjected to\n\nunsafe conditions even if no harm has yet befallen him).\n\n      We conclude, considering the preexisting case law of this circuit (which had\n\ncases with very similar facts) and of the Supreme Court (which made it plain that\n\nlack of physical injury did not mean that no Eighth Amendment violation had been\n\nestablished), that no reasonable sheriff could have concluded that the alleged\n\nconditions at the Jail failed to pose a substantial risk of serous harm, although no\n\nserious injury was alleged to have occurred at the Jail before the injuries suffered\n\nby Plaintiffs. That the alleged jail conditions posed no substantial risk of serious\n\nharm is incapable of being convincingly argued, considering the preexisting law.\n\n      Given that a substantial risk of serious harm was present, an Eighth-\n\nAmendment defendant might still be entitled to qualified immunity on a different\n\nbasis: if he responded in a way that was arguably reasonable -- in the light of the\n\nclearly established preexisting law -- to the substantial risk of serious harm to\n\ninmates. But at the time of the assaults in this case, it was clearly established in\n\nthis Circuit that it is an unreasonable response for an official to do nothing when\n\nconfronted with prison conditions -- like the conditions alleged in this case -- that\n\npose a risk of serious physical harm to inmates. See LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d\n\n\n                                          29\n\f1526, 1537-38 (11th Cir. 1993) (noting number of measures prison official should\n\nhave taken to respond to unconstitutional conditions at prison).\n\n          In this case, Plaintiffs allege that no measures were taken to improve\n\nconditions at the Jail. For example, the locks on the cells were never fixed; and\n\nsupervision of the inmates was never improved. We conclude, therefore, that\n\nPlaintiffs adequately allege facts which (if true) show that, at the time of the\n\nincident, the Sheriff’s acts were not even arguably reasonable in the light of the\n\nclearly established law.\n\n          On the jail conditions, the Sheriff -- at the Rule 12 stage -- is unentitled to\n\nqualified immunity for the claim that she was deliberately indifferent to the threat\n\nof serious harm to Plaintiffs.\n\n\n\nC.        Individual-Capacity Claims against Sheriff Harris for Deliberate\n          Indifference to Plaintiff Owens’s Serious Medical Needs (Count III)\n\n\n          Plaintiff Owens’s claim against the Sheriff for deliberate indifference to his\n\nserious medical needs fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.13 We\n\n     13\n      In the law, being released completely from confinement seems to be something different\nfrom a condition of confinement. The deliberate indifference standard has been used for\nconditions-of-confinement cases. Today, when the act that is supposed to be wrongful is a total\nrelease from custody, we have accepted -- because no one argued otherwise -- that the\ndeliberate indifference standard would be the correct one to apply. We have looked at the\ncomplaint in that light and with an eye on Farmer v. Brennan, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (1994). We,\nhowever, do not rule out that, if a total release from confinement can violate a prisoner’s federal\n\n                                                30\n\fstress that the deputy who released Owens in the manner alleged in the complaint\n\nwas not sued; so, his situation is not before us. We also stress that the Sheriff can\n\nhave no respondeat superior liability for a section 1983 claim. See Geter v. Wille,\n\n846 F.2d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir. 1988) (“Supervisory officials cannot be held liable\n\nfor the acts of employees solely on the basis of respondeat superior.”). See also\n\nPolk County v. Dodson, 102 S.Ct. 445, 453 (1981) (“Section 1983 will not support\n\na claim based on a respondeat superior theory of liability.”). Owens makes no\n\nallegation that the Sheriff personally participated in Owens’s release. Nor does\n\nOwens allege that the Sheriff was aware of the particular circumstances of\n\nOwens’s medical condition when he was released or of the manner of his release\n\non the night of the assault.14 The Sheriff’s potential liability, therefore, can be only\n\n\n\n\nrights at all, he might have to show the release was done “maliciously and sadistically for the\nvery purpose of causing harm.” See generally Id. at 1978. What standard is applicable seems\nquestionable. We leave the question undecided because it has not been raised, argued or briefed\nin this case. We also do not take into account the debatable nature of this most basic question\nwhen we write about whether the law was clearly established for the purposes of qualified\nimmunity.\n   14\n      The complaint does allege that the Sheriff was called by a deputy during the assault of\nOwens at the Jail and that the Sheriff did not come to the Jail. The Chief Deputy came. Nothing\nalleges that the Sheriff was aware of who was being assaulted, the severity of the assault, or that\nan inmate would have to go to the hospital. According to the complaint, Owens received\nmedical care after the time of the call to the Sheriff. There is no allegation that the Sheriff was\naware of Owens’s condition after he received the medical care at the hospital or aware that\nOwens was going to be released from the Jail or that the Sheriff refused to listen or to confer\nwith the Chief Deputy about whether or how Owens should be released.\n\n                                                31\n\fpolicymaker liability. But the complaint is insufficient to state a claim against the\n\nSheriff as a policymaker.15\n\n        Owens alleges that the Sheriff had a “policy of releasing sick or injured\n\ninmates,” and concluded that the policy was “developed and implemented... with\n\ndeliberate indifference to the medical needs of Owens after his assault.”16 Owens\n\nalleges no facts from which a fact-finder could find that the Sheriff actually knew\n\n\n\n\n   15\n      Before the complaint was dismissed, Plaintiffs were on notice that they might not have\nsufficiently alleged that the Sheriff was deliberately indifferent to Owens’s medical needs. The\nSheriff’s motion to dismiss argued that Plaintiffs failed to allege a constitutional violation\nbecause they failed to allege “personal participation,” or “any type of policy she enacted which\ncaused the injuries.”\n        The magistrate judge’s recommendations concluded that Plaintiffs failed to allege an\nEighth Amendment violation. Plaintiffs filed objections to the magistrate judge’s\nrecommendation but did not seek to amend the complaint. Even after the district court dismissed\ntheir claims, Plaintiffs did not seek to amend the complaint. When Plaintiffs have had ample\nopportunity to request to amend their complaint, but have failed to do so, nothing compels us to\nremand to allow them to amend. See Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1318 (11th\nCir. 1999) (where we affirmed dismissal without remand to amend when plaintiff failed to\nrequest leave to amend the complaint in district court); Long v. Satz, 181 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th\nCir. 1999) (same). See generally Warth v. Seldin, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2206-7 (1975) (concluding, in\ncontext of motion to dismiss for lack of standing, that after opportunity to amend to include\n“particularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiffs standing,” complaint must be\ndismissed if standing not adequately apparent from complaint).\n   16\n     In the light of the usual pleading requirements of Fed. Rule Civil Proc. 8(a), unsupported\nconclusions of law or of mixed fact and law have long been recognized not to prevent a Rule\n12(b)(6) dismissal. See Stanton v. United States, 434 F.2d 1273, 1276 (5th Cir. 1970). See also\nAssociated Builders, Inc. v. Alabama Power Co., 505 F.2d 97, 100 (5th Cir. 1974). We count the\n“developed and implemented . . . with deliberate indifference to the medical needs . . . .”\nlanguage in this unsupported-conclusion category. See generally Mass. School of Law v.\nAmerican Bar, 142 F.3d 26, 40 (1st Cir. 1998) (a review court need not “swallow plaintiff’s\ninvective hook, line and sinker; bald assertions unsupportable conclusions, periphrastic\ncircumlocutions, and the like need not be credited”).\n\n                                              32\n\fthat her release policy posed a sufficiently substantial risk of serious harm to\n\ninmates.\n\n        Owens does not allege that the Sheriff -- on or before 3 July 1996 -- was\n\naware of earlier violations of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights flowing\n\nfrom this kind of policy or from the release of other sick or injured inmates. Cf.\n\nChestnut v. City of Quincy, 513 F.2d 91, 92 (5th Cir. 1975)(indicating that\n\ncomplaint alleging police supervisor had notice of past culpable conduct of\n\nsubordinates and failed to prevent recurrence of such misconduct states section\n\n1983 claim for personal liability). Owens never alleges one such bad, earlier\n\nrelease incident at the jail.\n\n        An official cannot be held liable just for instituting a facially constitutional\n\npolicy. See City of Canton v. Harris, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1204 (1989) (saying no\n\npolicymaker liability exists when subordinate applies facially valid constitutional\n\npolicy in unconstitutional manner). See also Schmelz v. Monroe County., 954\n\nF.2d 1540, 1544 (11th Cir. 1992 ) (concluding no personal liability for Sheriff who\n\ninstituted facially constitutional policy). Cf. Monell v. Department of Social\n\nServs., 98 S.Ct. 2018 (1978) (holding municipality liable for facially\n\nunconstitutional policy).17 In this case, Owens alleges that the Sheriff had a policy\n\n   17\n      In considering the Sheriff’s potential personal liability as a policymaker, we have looked at\ndecisions involving the liability of local governments as policymakers. The local government\n\n                                                33\n\fof releasing sick or injured inmates. We believe such a policy, on its face, violates\n\nno constitutional guarantees and is not a facially unconstitutional policy. See\n\nUnited States v. Salerno, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 2100 (1987) (for policy to be facially\n\nunconstitutional it is required “that no set of circumstances exists under which the\n\nAct would be valid”). As Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote in their Reply Brief, such a\n\nrelease policy could be applied humanely and properly. We specifically reject the\n\nidea that the policy, on its face, is “obviously” a danger to inmates to the degree\n\nthat the allegation of the policy itself is an allegation of personal awareness on the\n\nSheriff’s part of an excessive risk of serious harm to inmates just because the\n\npolicy exists.\n\n       Owens’s allegation that the way the policy was applied by the Chief Deputy\n\nfor Owens’s release violated his federal rights is also insufficient to state a claim\n\nagainst the Sheriff personally. See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 106 S.Ct. 1292,\n\n1300 n.11 (1986) (discussing City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 105 S.Ct. 2427\n\n(1985), and saying that single incident of unconstitutional conduct by\n\nnonpolicymaking official is insufficient to show that the “unconstitutional act was\n\n\n\nprecedents are not directly on point. The reason is that the standard for imposing policymaker\nliability on a local government is more favorable to plaintiffs than is the standard for imposing\npolicymaker liability on a Sheriff or other jail official in his personal capacity in a case like this\none. Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1981. Still, the local government cases can guide us by analogy; if a\nlocal government would not be liable as a policymaker a fortiori there is no personal liability.\n\n                                                  34\n\ftaken pursuant to a municipal policy” (emphasis in the original)). See also\n\nCaldwell v. City of Englewood, 959 F.2d 670 (7th Cir. 1992) (explaining that\n\nallegation of single incident does not support reasonable inference of policy or\n\ncustom). As we have already said, Owens -- when he alleges the wrongful release\n\nof a sick or injured inmate -- alleges only the single incident involving him. He\n\nalleges no past pattern of inmate releases that, if proved, might support that this\n\nSheriff had a policy or custom of releasing inmates with deliberate indifference to\n\ntheir serious medical needs.\n\n      For similar reasons, Owens has failed to allege sufficient facts showing that\n\nthe Sheriff can be held personally liable for inadequate training about the manner\n\nof releasing sick or injured inmates. Unless a policymaker knows of the need to\n\ntrain an officer in a particular subject area, no liability can arise from failure to\n\ntrain him. See Gold v. City of Miami, 151 F.3d 1346, 1351 (11th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Owens never alleges that he was wrongfully released because Chief Deputy\n\nHartley, the person who actually released him, was inadequately trained to deal\n\nwith the usual and recurring situations of releasing sick or injured inmates. The\n\ncomplaint does say, when describing the general jail conditions, that the state\n\ncorrections department had “recommended” that all jail employees be trained at jail\n\nmanagement seminars and that, by 1996, “almost no one who worked at the jail --\n\n\n                                            35\n\fincluding the sheriff, the jail administrators, and most jailers” had been\n\nprofessionally trained. But the complaint allegations never say that Chief Deputy\n\nHartley did not have the recommended professional training. And the complaint\n\nnever says that the “on the job” training for release of inmates was inadequate.\n\nMoreover, the complaint does not say that Chief Deputy Hartley released Owens in\n\nthe manner he did because of inadequate training. Furthermore, the complaint does\n\nnot allege facts indicating that the Sheriff knew that Deputy Hartley’s lack of\n\ntraining (if any) about releasing inmates posed an excessive risk of serious harm to\n\ninmates. And from the well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint, no\n\ninferences can be reasonably drawn to make up for the missing facts. “[P]leadings\n\nmust be something more than an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable.”\n\nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Ag. Proc., 93 S. Ct. 2405, 2416\n\n(1973).\n\n      About his release from jail, the information presented in the complaint is\n\ninsufficient. For Count III, Owens has failed to state a claim for a constitutional\n\nviolation against the Sheriff personally -- as a policymaker.\n\n      Even if the complaint did state a claim against the Sheriff for a constitutional\n\nviolation on account of the policy of releasing sick or injured inmates, we -- in the\n\nalternative -- conclude that the Sheriff would be entitled to qualified immunity. To\n\n\n                                          36\n\fdefeat the Sheriff’s qualified immunity defense, Owens must show that the\n\npreexisting applicable law was so clearly established in July 1996 that every\n\nreasonable Sheriff would have known that releasing sick and injured inmates\n\nwould violate the constitutional rights of inmates. This legal clarity did not exist.\n\n      The Constitution, on its face, says nothing about medical care due inmates.\n\nThe right to medical care was inferred by the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Estelle v.\n\nGamble, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290 (1976); Helling, 113 S.Ct. at 2480. And the scope of\n\nthat right is, therefore, necessarily defined by case law. In July 1996, no case law\n\nestablished that releasing a sick or injured prisoner violated a constitutional right to\n\nreceive care for a serious medical condition. To the best of our knowledge, no\n\nreported decision in this country had ever held such a thing.\n\n      In Estelle, the Supreme Court interpreted the Eighth Amendment’s words\n\nagainst “cruel and unusual punishments,” and, for the first time, determined that\n\ngovernments -- presented with an inmate with a serious medical condition -- had an\n\n“obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by\n\nincarceration.” Estelle, 975 S.Ct. at 290. The Court reasoned that, “[a]n inmate\n\nmust rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if authorities fail to do\n\nso, those needs will not be met.” Id. Under Estelle, the critical fact supporting the\n\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\fobligation on the government is the fact of incarceration: the prisoner cannot get\n\nhis own care, nor can anyone from outside the jail get to him to help him.\n\n      In 1989, the Supreme Court restated this rationale -- the importance of\n\nconfinement -- in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 109\n\nS.Ct. 998 (1989), a Fourteenth Amendment case. The Court wrote “[t]he\n\naffirmative duty to protect arises not from the State’s knowledge of the\n\nindividual’s predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the\n\nlimitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.” Id. at\n\n1005-06.\n\n      It is the Estelle line of cases, cases which deal with deliberate indifference to\n\nan inmate’s serious medical needs, that bears the most on our study of the\n\npreexisting law and this case. See Helling, 113 S. Ct. at 2480; West v. Atkins,\n\n108 S.Ct. 2250, 2258 (1988) (saying that in Estelle the Court held that the State has\n\nconstitutional obligation to provide adequate medical care to those whom it has\n\nincarcerated because inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical\n\nneeds); Rhodes v. Chapman, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399 (1981) (saying that the Estelle\n\ndecision “rested on the fact, recognized by common law and legislatures, that ‘an\n\ninmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\ffail to do so, those needs will not be met”). See also DeShaney, 1074 S.Ct. at\n\n1005.\n\n        In each of the cases in this line, the main fact is the fact of continuing\n\nincarceration of a sick or injured inmate.18 And whatever was written in the\n\nopinions should be read in the context of the fact of continuing incarceration. “It is\n\na maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be\n\ntaken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.” Cohens v.\n\nVirginia, 19 U.S. 264, 399 (6 Wheat. 264) (1821) (Marshall, C.J.).\n\n        In none of these earlier cases was the inmate complaining about his total\n\nrelease from confinement. “Release from confinement” is a highly material fact\n\nfor Count III in this case. So, this case is materially different from every case cited\n\nby Plaintiffs or found by us, particularly cases decided before July 1996.\n\nConsidering the absence of preexisting precedent dealing with the release of sick or\n\ninjured inmates, we must conclude that a reasonable sheriff, in July 1996, could\n\ndetermine that the fact of his having a policy of releasing sick or injured inmates --\n\n   18\n      Plaintiffs also point out a number of Eleventh Circuit cases that are part of the same line.\nPlaintiffs argue these cases clearly established that “intentional interference with prescribed”\ntreatment amounts to a constitutional violation. See Young v. City of Augusta, 59 F.3d 1160,\n1169 (11th Cir. 1995); Howell v. Evans, 922 F.2d 712 (11th Cir. 1991), vacated as settled, 931\nF.2d 720, reinstated, by unpublished order (11th Cir. June 24, 1991); Washington v. Dugger, 860\nF.2d 1018, 1021 (11th Cir. 1988); Adridge v. Montgomery, 753 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir. 1985).\nBut, in each of these cases the facts were materially different from the case now before us: the\nplaintiffs in these cases were not released and were alleging deprivation of medical care while\nthey remained incarcerated.\n\n                                               39\n\fthat is, giving inmates their liberty -- could make all the difference on whether a\n\nmedical-needs-related violation of the Federal Constitution would arise for the sick\n\nor injured inmates.\n\n        Not only was the legal landscape, in July 1996, totally barren of cases\n\ndeciding that giving a sick or injured prisoner his liberty would violate his federal\n\nrights,19 the only case to our knowledge that had earlier discussed the pertinent\n\nlegal point reached the opposite conclusion. Fewer than two months before the\n\nincidents underlying this case, a federal district judge in California had written -- in\n\na reasoned opinion -- that a sick prisoner who was released on parole had no claim\n\nfor denial of medical care because, “[a]t the time of his parole, plaintiff was not\n\nsuffering from a ‘deprivation of liberty’ that precluded him from obtaining medical\n\ncare; accordingly, plaintiff had no constitutional guarantee of State-provided\n\n\n\n\n   19\n      Plaintiffs cite a case decided in 1998 from the Sixth Circuit concluding that police officers\nwere not entitled to qualified immunity when they released a vagrant whom they had arrested\nearlier in the evening for public drunkenness. See Davis v. Brady, 143 F.3d 1021, 1027 (6th Cir.\n1998). Besides the fact that Davis is not a decision binding in this circuit and was decided close\nto two years after Owens’s release, Davis involved no claim of deliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs. Furthermore, in Davis, unlike in this case, the Defendants were not the local-\ngovernment employer or the supervisors of the police: not policymakers sued as such. In Davis,\nthe defendants were the specific police officers who actually released plaintiff (when he was\ndrunk) at a dangerous place. See Id. at 1023.\n\n                                                40\n\fmedical care.” Wakefield v. Thompson, No. C 95-0137 FMS (N.D. Cal. Apr. 30,\n\n1996).20\n\n        The decided cases, preexisting the inmate release underlying this suit, said\n\nthat the decisive fact which obligated a prison official to provide medical care to a\n\nprisoner is the fact of the prisoner’s involuntary confinement, confinement that\n\nprevented the prisoner from obtaining care from other sources. By releasing a\n\nprisoner (for example, at a public place), a sheriff can enable the prisoner to obtain\n\ncare from other sources (something that eventually happened in this very case). A\n\nreasonable Sheriff in 1996 could believe that releasing sick and injured inmates\n\nwas lawful. The “fact of confinement” in the preexisting cases limited the duty of\n\njailers and -- more important for qualified immunity purposes -- removed the\n\n\n\n   20\n       We take seriously the idea of “clearly established.” When, around the pertinent time, a\ndistrict judge is writing that a kind of conduct does not violate the Constitution at all, we need to\nbe particularly careful before concluding that the law was already truly clearly established to be\nthe opposite of the judge’s opinion. See Denno, 218 F.3d at 1274; Barts, 865 F.2d at 1193. See\nalso Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1701 (2000) (stating that when judges disagree on constitutional\nquestion it is unfair to subject officials to money damages for picking wrong side in debate).\n         By the way, we know that the Ninth Circuit, in 1999, did not agree totally with the\ndistrict court’s view. The appellate court decided that a specific corrections officer did, if the\nallegations were true, demonstrate deliberate indifference to the inmate’s serious medical needs\nin violation of the Constitution. Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1165 (9th Cir. 1999).\nThe allegations were that the corrections officer personally handled the pertinent inmate’s\nrelease and allegedly declined to provide the inmate, at the time of release, with a two-week\nsupply of medications which a prison physician had prescribed and instructed be provided on the\ninmate’s release to the inmate (who, without the medication, would suffer a relapse of his mental\ndisorder, causing violent outbursts). Id. at 1162. The material facts in Wakefield differ from the\nmaterial facts in this case. And the Ninth Circuit in Wakefield addressed no defense of qualified\nimmunity.\n\n                                                 41\n\fpower of the preexisting precedents to put sheriffs on fair and clear notice that\n\nreleasing injured prisoners certainly would constitute deliberate indifference to an\n\ninmate’s serious medical needs.\n\n        It is simply not true that the federal law in July 1996 was already so clearly\n\nestablished to prohibit a policy of releasing sick or injured inmates that reasonable\n\nsheriffs would know the policy was unlawful. The Sheriff therefore is entitled to\n\nimmunity for her policy of releasing sick and injured inmates.21\n\n\n\n\n                                        V. Conclusion\n\n\n\n        From the complaint’s allegations, we conclude that Plaintiffs have\n\nsufficiently stated a claim against the County and the Sheriff for the conditions at\n\nthe Butler County Jail. We also conclude that Plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged\n\nthat the Sheriff personally is liable for deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious\n\nmedical needs. In addition, we conclude that the Sheriff in her official capacity is\n\n   21\n      We need not reach the question of whether the Sheriff might be entitled to qualified\nimmunity on other, more specific, grounds. For example, preexisting cases had not yet defined,\neven generally, the point at which some risk of harm becomes -- by virtue of the circumstances\nsurrounding a policy to release sick or injured inmates -- “a substantial risk of serious harm” for\nthe purposes of the law. We need not focus so finely, considering the law was not clearly\nestablished at an even higher level of generality, that is, on whether a release from confinement\ncould violate the Federal Constitution at all.\n\n                                                42\n\fimmune from suit. Moreover, we conclude that, if the allegations against the\n\nSheriff are otherwise sufficient to state a claim, the Sheriff in her individual\n\ncapacity is immune from suit for deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious\n\nmedical needs.\n\n\n\n      The district court’s order is REVERSED, except for the dismissal of all\n\nclaims against the Sheriff in her official capacity and for the dismissal of the claims\n\nagainst the County and the Sheriff, in her individual capacity, on deliberate\n\nindifference to Owens’s serious medical needs.\n\n      The case is REMANDED for further proceedings on Counts I and II.\n\n\n\n      REVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which\nBARKETT, MARCUS and WILSON, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n         I concur in the court’s judgment reversing the district court’s determination\n\nthat the Sheriff is immune from suit for the injuries Marsh and Owens received as a\n\nresult of the brutal assaults they suffered at the Butler County Jail.1 I dissent,\n\nhowever, from the majority’s holding that the doctrine of qualified immunity bars\n\nthe Count III claim for the injuries Owens suffered after Chief Deputy Phillip\n\nHartley released him from the jail and – in total disregard of the hospital’s\n\ndischarge instructions that “the Sheriff’s Department follow specific procedures to\n\ncare for Owens’ head wounds and . . . monitor his level of consciousness, pupils,\n\nvision, and coordination, and to call the hospital immediately if any change\n\noccurred”2 – abandoned him, shoeless and in bloody clothing, in front of the Thrifty\n\nInn motel on the edge of town, at Exit 128 on Interstate Highway 65.3 As I read the\n\nmajority opinion, the Sheriff cannot be held to answer for Owens’ injuries because\n\n\n   1\n       The Jail is located in the City of Greenville, the county seat of Butler County.\n   2\n       See paragraph 53 of the complaint, which is attached to this opinion as an Appendix.\n   3\n     The internet site Mapquest pinpoints the location of the Thrifty Inn at Exit 128 on I-65.\nMapquest (visited Sept. 22, 2001 <http://www.mapquest.com>). The Rand McNally Road Atlas\nshows that I-65 bypasses Greenville, and that Exit 128 is beyond Greenville’s city limits.\nAlthough these facts are not alleged with such precision in the complaint, the complaint does\nallege that after Hartley let Owens out of his car at the Thrifty Inn and drove away, the clerks at\nthe Inn refused to give him a room, and when a Waffle House restaurant nearby also provided no\nhelp, Owens wandered onto I-65. We should take judicial notice of the location of the City of\nGreenville, I-65, and the Thrifty Inn, since these facts could not reasonably be disputed.\n\n                                                   44\n\f(1) she had no notice of Owens’ release from the jail, (2) she did not participate in\n\nany way in Owens’ release and subsequent abandonment, and (3) she cannot be\n\nheld liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for Hartley’s inexcusable\n\nconduct.\n\n      After reading the facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom, as Rule 12(b)(6) requires, I conclude that the failure of the\n\ncomplaint to allege that the Sheriff actually knew of Owens’ medical condition, the\n\ndischarge instructions the hospital had given Chief Deputy Hartley and Deputy\n\nSheriff Benny Lowery, and Owens’ release from the jail and subsequent\n\nabandonment at the Thrifty Inn is entirely irrelevant. What is relevant is how the\n\nSheriff handled inmate assaults – in particular, how she handled those who, like\n\nMarsh and Owens, were seriously injured. I thus turn first to her handling of inmate\n\nassaults.\n\n      What the facts – alleged and reasonably inferred – show is that the Sheriff did\n\nabsolutely nothing to prevent inmate assaults at the jail. As the majority\n\nacknowledges, given the jail’s configuration and the lack of security, with only one\n\njailor on duty most of the time, assaults were not only inevitable, they were\n\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\froutine.4 In Marsh’s case, the inmates who committed the assault were not\n\ndisciplined (they should have been prosecuted for committing a felony); instead,\n\nthey were permitted to retain their weapons (they assaulted Owens with the pipe\n\nthey used to assault Marsh), and they were given a free run on the second floor.5 In\n\nother words, the inmates had a green light to commit mayhem with impunity. The\n\nmajority properly concludes that this constituted the Sheriff’s “custom or policy”\n\nfor dealing with inmate assaults – notwithstanding the fact that the custom or policy\n\nhad not been reduced to writing, and the complaint does not spell it out as such. I\n\nnow turn to the Sheriff’s handling of the victims of inmate assaults who received\n\nserious injuries.\n\n         If the victim was a sentenced prisoner, the inmate, after receiving the\n\nnecessary medical treatment, would be returned to the jail and would remain there\n\n(unless, and until, transported to a state prison facility). This is what happened in\n\nMarsh’s case. He was severely beaten, and then taken to the emergency room at\n\n   4\n     I say that inmate assaults routinely took place because such can be inferred from the\nmultiple complaints lodged against the Sheriff by authorities responsible for overseeing prison\nand jail conditions in Alabama and the lawsuit pending against her in the United States District\nCourt for the Middle District of Alabama. The majority properly acknowledges that these\ncomplaints, which are described in paragraphs 27 through 29 of the complaint, preceded the\nassaults against Marsh and Owens. I also infer that the assaults routinely took place from what\nthe jailors – Sabrena Stone and Preston Nicholson – did, and did not do, once they became aware\nthat the beatings Marsh and Owens sustained in this case were taking place.\n   5\n       See Appendix paragraphs 17, 37, 47.\n\n\n                                               46\n\fStabler Hospital. After being treated in the emergency room, he was returned to the\n\njail and placed in a holding cell – to separate him from his assailants.6 If the inmate\n\nhappened to be a pretrial detainee – meaning that a court had denied him admission\n\nto bail – the Sheriff would ignore the fact that a judge had ordered him detained7\n\nand would release the detainee on his own recognizance.8 This is what happened in\n\nOwens’ case.9 Owens had been ordered detained,10 but Chief Deputy Sheriff\n\nHartley nonetheless released him. The inference, I submit, is inescapable, not\n\nmerely permissible – that Hartley, in releasing an inmate who had been ordered\n\ndetained, and then abandoning him in front of the Thrifty Inn at 3:30 in the\n\n\n   6\n       See Appendix paragraph 39.\n   7\n     As noted in the text infra, under Alabama law, a person charged with a misdemeanor is\nentitled as a matter of right to release on his own recognizance or an appearance bond unless a\ncourt orders him detained. Ala. R. Crim. P. 7.2(a).\n   8\n     The majority opinion is silent concerning the lawfulness of the Sheriff’s alleged “policy and\ncustom releasing sick or injured inmates.” See Appendix paragraph 54. It would be unlawful\nfor the Sheriff to release a sentenced inmate prior to the completion of his sentence or his release\non parole. This is why the Sheriff did not release Marsh. On discharge from the hospital, Marsh\nwas taken back to the jail and detained until August 6, 1996, when he was transported to a state\ncorrectional institution. See Appendix paragraph 9. It would also be unlawful for the Sheriff to\nrelease a pretrial detainee, for to release him would violate the court order requiring the Sheriff\nto detain him.\n   9\n       See Appendix paragraph 54.\n   10\n      The complaint alleges that Owens occupied the status of a pretrial detainee. See Appendix\nparagraph 41. We must assume, therefore, as I establish in Subpart A, infra, that a court had\ndenied him admission to bail and ordered his detention (in the Butler County Jail) – until further\norder of the court.\n\n\n                                                 47\n\fmorning, was not acting on his own; instead, he was acting pursuant to the Sheriff’s\n\ncustom or policy – notwithstanding the fact that it had not been reduced to writing\n\nand the complaint does not spell it out as such.\n\n        This inference is inescapable – that is, a fair minded jury could reasonably\n\ndraw it – when one focuses, first, on Hartley’s, and to a lesser extent Lowery’s,\n\nconduct from the moment Owens was discharged from the hospital until Hartley\n\nabandoned him in front of the Thrifty Inn, and, second, on the facts that led the\n\nmajority to conclude that the Sheriff was not entitled to qualified immunity from\n\nsuit for the beatings Marsh and Owens sustained at the jail. Hartley’s conduct\n\nshould not be considered in isolation. Why Hartley did what he did is explained in\n\nlarge part by how the Sheriff ran the jail and, in particular, by what took place there\n\nbetween Marsh’s assault on July 1 and Owens’ assault two and a half days later.11\n\n        In Part I, I set forth – from the facts alleged in the complaint and from the\n\npermissible inferences they yield – what took place upon and after Owens’\n\ndischarge from the hospital. From those facts and inferences, I posit, in Subpart A,\n\nthat one of two things occurred: either Hartley was acting on his own when he\n\nreleased Owens from custody and then abandoned him at the Thrifty Inn, or, as I\n\n   11\n     Marsh’s assault took place in the afternoon of July 1, while Jailor Stone, who worked the\nday shift, was on duty. Owens’ assault took place between 11:00 p.m. and midnight on July 3,\nwhile Jailor Nicholson was on duty.\n\n\n                                               48\n\fconclude, he was acting pursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy. I do so because,\n\nas depicted in Subpart B (and in the majority opinion), the events that took place\n\nbefore Owens’ discharge from the hospital point inexorably to the proposition that\n\nHartley acted not on his own, but pursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy.\n\n                                          A.\n\n          Owens was a pretrial detainee, charged with a misdemeanor. Under\n\nAlabama law, a person charged with a misdemeanor “as a matter of right may be\n\nreleased pending or during trial on his or her personal recognizance or on an\n\nappearance bond unless the court or magistrate determines that such a release will\n\nnot reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance.” ALA. R. CRIM. P. 7.2(a).\n\nOwens’ pretrial detainee status therefore meant that a court or magistrate had\n\ndenied him release. The circumstances surrounding his incarceration – from the\n\ntime he entered the jail until Hartley released him in the early morning of July 4 –\n\nfully evidences the fact that Owens had been ordered detained. Had he been\n\ngranted release on his own recognizance, Owens would have signed his bond on\n\nJuly 1 and walked out of the jail. He would have done so because he feared for his\n\nsafety. On July 2 or 3, after having been harassed by other inmates, he asked Jailor\n\nStone to put him in a solitary cell. She refused his request.12 Moreover, had he\n\n   12\n        See Appendix paragraph 45.\n\n\n                                          49\n\fbeen entitled to leave on his own recognizance, his uncle, who came to the jail with\n\nhis medicine on July 2 (after his grandmother had spoken to the jailor on duty),\n\nwould have obtained his release.13 Thus, as of the time he suffered the assault –\n\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and midnight on July 3 – and as of the time of his release – at\n\n3:30 a.m. on July 4 – Owens’ status as a pretrial detainee had not been altered.\n\nChief Deputy Hartley obviously knew this; that is why he rushed Owens to “sign\n\nhis own bond” less than twenty minutes after his discharge from the hospital.\n\nHartley was in such a hurry to get Owens out of the jail and out of town that he did\n\nnot pause to retrieve Owens’ shoes or find something for him to wear.14 I return to\n\nthat point later.\n\n         Hartley came to the jail while Owens was being assaulted or shortly\n\nthereafter;15 he was the only person in the Sheriff’s office to accept Nicholson’s\n\nplea for help. Nicholson, on duty alone at the jail, “called the Greenville City\n\nPolice. Two city police officers arrived, but refused to go upstairs. Nicholson then\n\n\n\n   13\n        See Appendix paragraph 43.\n   14\n      I realize that the complaint did not allege this in the manner I have set out. I am convinced,\nhowever, that a competent lawyer would be entitled to argue the point to a jury notwithstanding\nthe Sheriff’s objection.\n   15\n     The complaint does not fix the precise moment of his arrival at the jail. It had to be,\nhowever, before an ambulance came to transport Owens to the hospital at 12:17 a.m. on July 4.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fcalled Sheriff Harris and Jail Administrator Thelma Teague. Both refused to come\n\nto the jail.”16 When the county’s chief law enforcement officer refused to become\n\ninvolved, Nicholson turned to Chief Deputy Hartley.17\n\n           The brutal assault on Owens by four inmates – the same four who assaulted\n\nMarsh on July 1 – began sometime between 11p.m. and midnight on July 3 and\n\nlasted between thirty to sixty minutes.18 It was, under Alabama law, an assault in\n\nthe first degree,19 if not attempted murder.20 The assailants suspended the assault\n\n16\n     See Appendix paragraph 49.\n      17\n        The inferences here are either (1) that Nicholson called Hartley pursuant to the Sheriff’s\ninstructions or (2) that the Sheriff gave Nicholson no instructions, so he called Hartley on his\nown initiative. The first inference supports the ultimate inference that Hartley was acting\npursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy. However, not until the plaintiff is able to interrogate\nNicholson and the Sheriff under oath will the truth be known. Under the majority’s approach to\nthe problem, plaintiff’s counsel should have alleged the first inference as a fact. In that\nplaintiff’s adversary has possession of all of the evidence on the point, how counsel could make\nsuch an allegation without violating Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure escapes me.\n18\n     See Appendix paragraphs 49, 50.\n      19\n           ALA. CODE § 13A-6-20 (2001) defines assault in the first degree as:\n                 (a) A person commits the crime of assault in the first\n                 degree if:\n                 (1) with intent to cause serious physical injury to another\n                 person, he causes serious physical injury to any person\n                 by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument;\n                 or\n                 ...\n                 (3) under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference\n                 to the value of human life, he recklessly engages in\n                 conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another\n                 person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to any\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fon several occasions upon hearing the rustling of keys but continued to beat Owens\n\n“[w]hen they realized that no one was coming upstairs.”21 Twenty minutes after the\n\nincident, Hartley retrieved Owens, who “lay in a pool of blood on the dayroom\n\nfloor.”22 Owens’ injuries were serious and an ambulance was called to the scene; at\n\n12:17 a.m., it transported Owens to Stabler Hospital.23 He was received in the\n\nemergency room and treated there for nearly three hours, until 3:10 a.m., when\n\nChief Deputy Hartley and Deputy Lowery regained his custody. To obtain Owens’\n\ncustody, they had to sign a discharge sheet which stated that Owens was being\n\n\n                 person.\n      20\n     Under ALA. CODE § 13A-6-2 (2001), a person commits murder if:\n           (1) With intent to cause the death of another person, he\n           causes the death of that person or of another person . . . .\nALA. CODE § 13A-4-2 (2001) defines attempt as follows:\n           (a) a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if,\n           with the intent to commit a specific offense, he does any\n           overt act towards the commission of such offense.\n           ...\n           (d) An attempt is a:\n           (1) Class A felony if the offense attempted is murder.\n\nAt one point during the assault on Owens, an inmate called Jailor Nicholson for\nhelp, yelling “they’re killing him up here.” See Appendix paragraph 48.\n\n21\n     See Appendix paragraph 50.\n22\n     See Appendix paragraphs 51, 52.\n23\n     See Appendix paragraph 52.\n\n\n                                         52\n\fdischarged into the custody of the “Sheriff’s Department” with instructions “to\n\nfollow specific procedures to care for Owens’ head wounds and other injuries[,] . . .\n\nto monitor his level of consciousness, pupils, vision, and coordination, and to call\n\nthe hospital immediately if any change occurred.”24 A fair-minded jury would\n\nreadily infer from the allegation that the two deputies “signed a discharge sheet”\n\nthat they had read and understood the instructions it contained. The jury would also\n\ninfer the deputies, in signing the discharge sheet, the deputies represented, and the\n\nemergency room physician assumed, that Owens would remain in the custody of the\n\nSheriff’s Department.25\n\n           This representation was false, and it was false when made. Chief Deputy\n\nHartley never intended to have Owens monitored by the Sheriff’s Department – at\n\nthe Butler County Jail or any other facility. Why? Because moments after he and\n\nLowery arrived back at the jail, he instructed Owens “to sign his own bond,”26 and\n\nthen took him to the edge of town, let him out at the Thrifty Inn and drove away.27\n\n\n24\n     See Appendix paragraph 53.\n      25\n     Can it be doubted that the discharge instructions were written by a physician? Since\nOwens was not admitted to the hospital proper, the physician had to be the doctor on duty in the\nemergency room.\n26\n     See Appendix paragraph 54.\n      27\n    Hartley did not even wait to see whether the Thrifty Inn would give Owens a room. We\nknow this because, after denying Owens a room, someone at the motel called the Greenville\n\n\n                                               53\n\fAll of this – from Owens’ discharge from the hospital to the arrival at the motel –\n\ntook no more than twenty minutes. How anxious was Hartley to get rid of Owens?\n\nHe was so anxious that he did not so much as bother to retrieve Owens’ shoes or get\n\nhim a change of clothing; he took Owens to the Thrifty Inn in the same horrible\n\ncondition in which he found Owens after the assault, and did not wait to see\n\nwhether he could get a room there. He simply let Owens out of the car and drove\n\noff. What does Hartley’s conduct imply? The possible inferences are (1) that he\n\ncommitted this reprehensible conduct entirely on his own, or (2) that he was acting\n\npursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy or explicit directions.28\n\n        If Hartley acted on his own, then he chose to lie to the emergency room\n\nphysician who told him and Lowery that he would not discharge Owens unless the\n\nSheriff’s office would agree to monitor his condition and to call the hospital if he\n\n\n\nPolice. See Appendix paragraph 55. By this time, Owens was out in the night fending for\nhimself.\n   28\n      Another inference is that Hartley thought that having Owens sign “his own bond” relieved\nhim, and the Sheriff, of the obligation to care for Owens’ serious medical needs in accordance\nwith the hospital’s discharge instructions. In other words, he could vitiate the instructions, and\nhis (and Lowery’s) representation – in signing the discharge sheet and by releasing Owens on his\nown recognizance. Attempting to avoid his, and the Sheriff’s, obligation to monitor Owens’\ncondition and report any untoward changes to the hospital would, in my view, be disingenuous.\nI doubt that a jury would infer that Hartley conjured such a scheme of avoidance between 3:10\nand 3:30 in the morning, and therefore reject the scheme as a permissible inference from the\nfacts alleged in the complaint.\n\n\n\n                                                54\n\ftook a turn for the worse. There can be no doubt that he lied to the emergency room\n\nphysician because the moment he arrived back at the jail, after having Owens sign\n\nhis bond, he turned around and headed out of town, letting Owens out at the Thrifty\n\nInn. Hartley not only lied to the physician, but he ignored the fact that a court had\n\nordered Owens detained. Why would the Sheriff’s Chief Deputy do such things?\n\nWhat incentive would he have to lie to the emergency room doctor,29 to disregard a\n\ncourt order, and, perhaps worst of all, to treat a human being as cruelly as he treated\n\nOwens? If the Greenville Police had not found Owens staggering on the I-65\n\noverpass, he could have been hit by a car and killed. A fair minded jury would find\n\nthat Hartley did such things – as utterly reprehensible and contemptuous as they\n\nwere – to keep his job. Under no circumstances would he do such things on his\n\nown. If he did, the Sheriff would fire him. Her explanation to the judge who had\n\nordered Owens detained would be that she had nothing to do with Hartley’s\n\n\n\n   29\n       I would dare say that, if his deposition is taken in this case, which will surely be done, the\nemergency room physician – in describing the seriousness of Owens’ injuries – will certainly\nemphasize the importance of the discharge instructions he gave Hartley and Lowery and relate in\nfull the conversation he had with these officers before he allowed them to take Owens away.\nOne does not have to be clairvoyant to picture what the doctor will say when asked – by the\nSheriff’s lawyers – whether Owens was in any condition to be taken out of town and left at the\nfront door of a motel along I-65 to fend for himself. Armed with the majority opinion, which\ngrants the Sheriff qualified immunity for Hartley’s conduct, the Sheriff’s lawyers will no doubt\nobject that the examination of the emergency room physician I posit would be improper. Their\nobjection should be ruled out of order; the examination I posit will constitute evidence\nconcerning the extent of the injuries Owens received at the jail.\n\n\n                                                 55\n\fdisregard of his detention order, and that he had been fired. In addition to losing his\n\njob, Hartley would leave himself wide open for a suit for damages. No, Hartley was\n\nfollowing the Sheriff’s custom or policy.30 If there is any doubt, the events that\n\ntook place before Hartley came on the scene should remove it.\n\n                                               B.\n\n        The majority properly acknowledges the deplorable conditions at Butler\n\nCounty Jail countenanced by Sheriff Harris. Her actions, or lack thereof, were so\n\negregious that every judge of this en banc court has voted to deny the Sheriff\n\nimmunity from suit despite the absence of a Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit case\n\non all fours that would have placed her on notice that her operation of the jail – top\n\nto bottom – constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments. No such notice is required where it would be\n\nobvious to anyone standing in the Sheriff’s shoes that her operation of the jail\n\n\n\n\n   30\n       I posit that, during the pretrial discovery that ensues once this case is returned to the\ndistrict court – especially the depositions of the Sheriff, Hartley, and those who operate Stabler\nHospital – plaintiff’s counsel will determine who would have been responsible for paying the\nbill if Owens had been admitted to the hospital. If the Sheriff would have been responsible,\nperhaps this might explain why Hartley and Lowery were willing to sign the discharge sheet and\nwhy Hartley abandoned Owens at the Thrifty Inn. In other words, the Sheriff’s standing orders\nwere to avoid having an assaulted inmate admitted to the hospital. In Owens’ case, implicit in\nthe monitoring instructions the emergency room physician gave the deputies is the fact that, had\nthey told the doctor that the Sheriff’s office was not going to obey the instructions, Owens would\nnot have been permitted to leave the hospital.\n\n\n                                                56\n\ftrampled upon the constitutional rights of sentenced inmates and pretrial\n\ndetainees.31\n\n        The building was in such a state of disrepair that inmates were able to fashion\n\nmakeshift weapons by cannibalizing parts of the decaying building. The locks on\n\nthe cell doors did not function, and as a result, inmates were not kept in distinct\n\nberths, but instead were free to roam with no classification to divide pretrial\n\ndetainees from convicted felons or violent offenders from nonviolent ones. Instead\n\nof making up for structural deficiencies with increased monitoring, the Sheriff\n\nallowed the facility to remain grossly understaffed and technologically deficient.\n\nThe inmate population was often controlled by a single jailor who was also\n\nresponsible for intake and release, monitoring the perimeter, as well as\n\nadministrative tasks such as coordinating mail, food service, medication, and\n\nphones.\n\n        That aggravated assaults by inmates had become acceptable is further\n\nevidenced by the conduct of the jailor in charge during the Marsh and Owens\n\nassaults. From the complaint, we can glean that one jailor worked the day shift and\n\none manned the night shift at the Butler County Jail. Sabrena Stone was on duty\n\n   31\n     While no on-all-fours-case from the Supreme Court or this court put the Sheriff on notice,\nshe nonetheless had plenty of notice from other quarters, not the least of which was a lawsuit\npending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. See supra note 4.\n\n\n                                               57\n\fduring the attack on Marsh; Nicholson was on duty during the assault on Owens.\n\nOn each occasion the jailor – Stone on July 1, and Nicholson on July 3 – waited\n\nuntil the attack was over to rescue the victim despite loud calls (from the victim and\n\nother inmates) for help. When attackers realized that no help for their victim was\n\ncoming, they returned to the dayroom to continue the assault. The assailants could\n\nconfidently continue their crimes knowing that they would not face legal\n\npunishment or any negative consequence within the jail. Neither Stone nor\n\nNicholson took any steps to bring the assailants to justice or to deter future\n\noccurrences of violence, nor did Investigator Harden, who took Marsh to the\n\nhospital, or Hartley or Lowery, who ministered to Owens. Indeed, the assailants\n\nhad a “green light.” The inferences that can be drawn from all of this are, first, that\n\nthe Sheriff was not going to charge any assailant, and, second, that her subordinates\n\nwere aware of her policy and therefore acted accordingly.\n\n      In sum, I submit that when one considers Chief Deputy Hartley’s conduct\n\nafter he surreptitiously obtained Owens’ release from the Stabler Hospital in the\n\nlight of what transpired at the jail beforehand, the inference is inescapable that\n\nHartley acted at the Sheriff’s behest. Lancaster v. Monroe County, 116 F.3d 1419,\n\n1429 (11th Cir. 1997), a case the majority opinion fails to cite, is directly on point.\n\nThere we observed that under Alabama law, “deputies are a legal extension of the\n\n\n                                           58\n\fsheriff because they act as sheriff’s agent and can perform any act within [the]\n\nsheriff’s authority.” (citing Carr v. City of Florence, 916 F.2d 1521, 1526 (11th\n\nCir. 1990)). How can it be argued that Chief Deputy Sheriff Hartley was not the\n\nSheriff’s agent?\n\n                                           II.\n\n      The proper use of Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is at\n\nstake in this case. The majority shows abject disregard for the Rule’s command\n\nrequiring us to accept all alleged facts as true and then draw from those facts as\n\nmany inferences favorable to the plaintiff as possible. Instead, the majority turns\n\na blind eye to context and considers each fact in isolation, in effect destroying any\n\nchance for a properly pled (circumstantial evidence) claim to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n      The traditional strategy for defeating a circumstantial evidence case – on the\n\npleadings, or on summary judgment, or at trial – is to isolate the facts alleged, or\n\nproven, and then say: what does this prove? Of course, it may prove nothing.\n\nDefense counsel in conspiracy prosecutions routinely make this argument to the\n\njury; they point to isolated acts, which are entirely innocent on their face – like\n\nmaking a telephone call, or walking across the street – and say that they establish\n\nnothing. The prosecutor, in responding, treats these innocent acts as dots and draws\n\n\n                                           59\n\flines between the dots. What emerges is the criminal conspiracy charged in the\n\nindictment. The majority opinion uses the former tactic here. For example,\n\nreferring to the Sheriff’s “custom and policy of releasing sick or injured inmates,”\n\nalleged as a fact in paragraph 54 of the complaint, the majority, isolates the fact and\n\nobserves: “We believe such a policy, on its face, violates no constitutional\n\nguarantees and is not a facially unconstitutional policy.” Ante at 34. I am at a loss\n\nto understand such treatment of this fact. Owens does not seek an order enjoining\n\nthis policy as unconstitutional. Rather, the allegation merely asserts why Hartley\n\nhad Owens sign his own bond. In addition to isolating facts revealed by the\n\ncomplaint, so to neutralize them, the majority, although paying lip service to the\n\nneed to consider the inferences these facts yield, says that “no inferences can be\n\nreasonably drawn to make up for the missing facts.” Ante at 36. I invite the\n\nmajority to say that the inferences I have drawn from the facts “well pled” in\n\nOwens’ complaint are not there.\n\n      The majority opinion, if implemented, will invite lawyers with cases like\n\nOwens’ – in which they have no access to the evidence that would explain why the\n\nSheriff and her deputies acted as they did – to allege facts in the blind. What about\n\nRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure? The majority opinion makes no\n\nmention of the rule, but it is surely implicated. Rule 11 states, in pertinent part:\n\n\n                                           60\n\f             (b) Representations to Court. By presenting to the court\n             . . . a [complaint] . . . an attorney . . . is certifying that to\n             the best of the [attorney’s] knowledge, information, and\n             belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the\n             circumstances, –\n             (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose,\n             such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or\n             needless increase in the cost of litigation;\n             (2) the [complaint’s] claims . . . and other legal\n             contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a\n             nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or\n             reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;\n             (3) the allegations and other factual contentions [of the\n             complaint] have evidentiary support or, if specifically so\n             identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a\n             reasonable opportunity for further investigation or\n             discovery . . . .\n             (c) Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable\n             opportunity to respond, the court determines that\n             subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may . . .\n             impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law\n             firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are\n             responsible for the violation.\n\n      FED. R. CIV. P. 11 (2001).\n\n      Let us suppose that, when this case returns to the district court, Owens’\n\ncounsel examines the Sheriff, Chief Deputy Hartley, the emergency room physician\n\n(who treated Owens), and the hospital’s administrator on deposition, and the\n\nfollowing is established:\n\n      1) The injuries Owens sustained during the assault were serious enough that\nhe needed close monitoring, because he might suffer a relapse.\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\f       2) After Owens arrived at the emergency room, at around 12:17 a.m., Hartley\ncalled the doctor on duty. The doctor told him that his injuries were serious and\nthat he need to be watched closely because his condition might worsen. The doctor\ntold Hartley that he should be hospitalized so his condition could be monitored;\nHartley responded that the monitoring could be done at the jail. Hartley said this\nbecause, after the ambulance transported Owens to the hospital, Hartley, knowing\nthat Owens had serious injuries, called the Sheriff. They discussed the possibility\nthat the emergency room doctor might want Owens admitted to the hospital proper,\nand that, if admitted, the Sheriff would have to pay the bill. The Sheriff did not\nwant to pay the bill; she was terribly short of funds – which explained why she had\nbeen unable to correct the multiple deficiencies the state corrections officials and\nothers had cited. So, the Sheriff instructed Hartley do what was necessary to keep\nOwens out of the hospital. He had to lie to the emergency room doctor, if\nnecessary.\n\n       3) Hartley lied to the doctor; he misrepresented that Owens would be\nmonitored at the jail in accordance with the hospital’s, and the doctors’, discharge\ninstructions.\n\n       4) At some point, Hartley and the Sheriff discussed Owens’ disposition after\nhe and Lowery retrieved him from the hospital. They recalled what had happened\nto Marsh after he returned to the jail; the four inmates who had assaulted him got\ninto his holding cell and blasted him with a fire extinguisher. The same four\ninmates were the ones who had assaulted Owens, and were still “at large,” and in\npossession of their weapons. If Owens were readmitted to the jail, they knew –\ngiven his condition – that he could not withstand another assault. The Sheriff’s and\nHartley’s discussion ended with the Sheriff’s instruction that Hartley get Owens out\nof the jail and take him to a motel on the edge of town. They overlooked the fact\nthat Owens was a pretrial detainee and, as such, could not be released except on\ncourt order.\n\n      If Count III had alleged these facts, I have no doubt that the majority would\n\nhold that the Sheriff is not entitled to qualified immunity. As I read the majority’s\n\nposition, the drafter of Count III should have alleged these facts or their equivalent.\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\fIn my view, the ethical constraints imposed on the litigation bar by Rule 11\n\nprecluded him from doing so. This is a quintessential Catch-22 situation, is it not?\n\n      Now, continuing the above supposition, after obtaining this evidence –\n\nwhich, with perhaps the exception of what the emergency room doctor might say –\n\nwas, and is, entirely in the possession of the Sheriff, her Chief Deputy, and their\n\nminions, Owens’ counsel moves the district court to amend Count III. The Sheriff,\n\nciting the law of the case doctrine, will object and her objection will probably be\n\nsustained. Or she will plead the statute of limitations. In either case, Owens, who\n\nhad no access to the evidence which would establish the facts the majority says he\n\nshould have pled, will go hence without day.\n\n      Respectfully, I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          63\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which\nTJOFLAT, MARCUS and WILSON, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n      I concur with the majority’s ultimate resolution of the claims against Sheriff\n\nHarris in her official capacity, the claims against Butler County, and Marsh and\n\nOwens’s deliberate indifference to serious risk of harm claims against the Sheriff in\n\nher individual capacity. I dissent, however, from the majority’s dismissal of\n\nOwens’s claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs against the\n\nSheriff in her individual capacity. I believe that the allegations in the complaint,\n\ntaken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Owens, are sufficient to\n\nwithstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state this claim. Moreover, I believe\n\nthat the law of deliberate indifference was sufficiently clear at the time of the\n\nincident that any reasonable government actor would have known that the alleged\n\nindiscriminate policy of releasing sick and injured inmates without guidelines that\n\nwould have prevented the officers from abandoning Owens in his condition at 3:00\n\na.m. on the side of the road was unconstitutionally applied to Owens.\n\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that the plaintiff’s complaint\n\ncontain only, “(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court’s\n\njurisdiction depends, . . . (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that\n\nthe pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the\n\n\n\n                                           64\n\fpleader seeks . . . .” In Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957), the Supreme Court\n\nexplained that Rule 8 “means what it says” in that the Rule does not “require a\n\nclaimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To the\n\ncontrary, all the Rules require is ‘a short and plain statement of the claim’ that will\n\ngive the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests.” Id. at 47. Consistent with this standard and cognizant of a\n\nplaintiff’s limited ability to develop facts early in the litigation process, the\n\nSupreme Court held that “a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a\n\nclaim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in\n\nsupport of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” Id. at 45-46; see also\n\nHarper v. Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998).\n\nHere, the complaint’s allegations, viewed in light of this standard, are sufficient to\n\nwithstand the Sheriff’s motion to dismiss.\n\n      “[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes\n\nthe ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’ proscribed by the Eighth\n\nAmendment.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (quoting Gregg v.\n\nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976)). In order to state such a claim against Sheriff\n\nHarris, Owens must allege that (1) he suffered from a serious medical need, (2)\n\nSheriff Harris was deliberately indifferent to that need, and (3) Harris’s deliberate\n\n\n                                            65\n\findifference caused him to suffer harm. See McElligot v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248,\n\n1254-55 (11th Cir. 1999). Moreover, deliberate indifference encompasses not only\n\nthe failure to provide attention to an inmate’s medical needs, but also intentionally\n\ninterfering with the inmate’s ability to receive prescribed health care. See Estelle,\n\n429 U.S. at 105; Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir.\n\n1985) (“Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is shown when prison\n\nofficials have prevented an inmate from receiving recommended treatment . . . .”)\n\n(quoting Ramos v. Lam, 639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980)); see also Wakefield v.\n\nThompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1164 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that prison’s duty to\n\nprovide medical care extends to period after release sufficient to allow former\n\ninmate to consult doctor and obtain new supply of medication). This is especially\n\ntrue where, as here, the plaintiff’s injury is the result of the official’s own\n\nmalfeasance and the release is at a time and place where the plaintiff stood little\n\nchance of receiving a prescribed treatment. This is not to say that the release of an\n\ninmate with a serious medical need always violates the Constitution. A jailer is not\n\nconstitutionally required to provide for the continued medical care of a released\n\ninmate. The Constitution does require, however, that the release itself not be an act\n\nof deliberate indifference – i.e. that the release, or manner of release, is not an\n\nunreasonable response to a known medical need. Therefore, where, as here, the\n\n\n                                            66\n\fserious medical need is known by the officials, is created by the official’s conduct,\n\nand the inmate is released in an unreasonable manner where he has little or no\n\nchance of obtaining his prescribed treatment, there is the deprivation of a\n\nconstitutional right.\n\n      Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, it cannot be gainsaid that the\n\ncondition Owens alleged he was in when he was released by the hospital constituted\n\na “serious medical need” and that the officers who took him from the hospital knew\n\nof his need. Owens’s head, neck and face were severely swollen and bruised, his lip\n\nhad a hole torn through it, his ribs and chest were bruised and had been diagnosed\n\nas requiring continuing care and monitoring for his head injuries. The complaint\n\nalleged that the officers signed a release form acknowledging the need for the\n\nprescribed care. See Hill v. DeKalb Reg’l Youth Det. Ctr., 40 F.3d 1176, 1187\n\n(11th Cir. 1994) (defining a serious medical need as “one that has been diagnosed\n\nby a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay\n\nperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention”). Likewise,\n\nthere can be no serious dispute that Owens sufficiently pled that the officers’\n\ndecision to ignore the instructions given to them at the hospital, and to instead\n\nabandon him barefoot, wearing bloodied clothing, severely swollen and bruised at\n\n\n\n\n                                          67\n\f3:00 a.m. with little or no chance of securing his prescribed care, caused him to\n\nsuffer harm.\n\n      Thus, in his claim against the Sheriff, the only question is whether Owens\n\nsufficiently alleged facts supporting the reasonable inference that the Sheriff was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. The majority holds that\n\nOwens has not satisfied this requirement because he has not alleged that the Sheriff\n\nis “causally linked” to his constitutional deprivation. See, e.g., Rizzo v. Goode, 423\n\nU.S. 362 (1976). Viewing the allegations in the complaint in the light most\n\nfavorable to Owens, however, I believe that the complaint is sufficient to withstand\n\nthe Sheriff’s motion to dismiss.\n\n      As our case law recognizes, there are several ways Owens can establish the\n\nrequired causal link. Although § 1983 requires a connection between the official’s\n\nacts or omissions and the plaintiff’s injury, “[p]ersonal participation is only one of\n\nseveral ways to establish the requisite causal connection. . . . An official may also\n\nbe liable where a policy or custom that [she] established or utilized results in\n\ndeliberate indifference to an inmate’s constitutional rights.” Zatler v. Wainwright,\n\n802 F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir. 1986) (internal citations omitted); see Swint v. City of\n\nWadley, Ala., 51 F.3d 988, 999 (11th Cir. 1995) (“‘[L]iability may be imposed due\n\n\n\n\n                                          68\n\fto the existence of an improper policy or from the absence of a policy.’”) (emphasis\n\nadded) (quoting Rivas v. Freeman, 940 F.2d 1491, 1495 (11th Cir. 1991)).\n\n      Owens alleged that the officers acted with deliberate indifference to his\n\nserious medical needs pursuant to a policy and custom of indiscriminately releasing\n\nsick and injured inmates. Owens also alleged that the Sheriff was responsible for\n\nthe development and implementation of any policy at the Jail pertaining to\n\ntreatment of sick and injured inmates. The complaint further alleged that the Sheriff\n\nreceived a call from the Jail during the assault on Owens. Rather than crediting\n\nthese allegations and viewing them in the light most favorable to Owens, the\n\nmajority refuses to infer any content into the phone conversation and simply refuses\n\nto accept the allegation of the Sheriff’s obligations regarding the development and\n\nimplementation of a reasonable medical policy.\n\n      As to the phone call, the majority states, “Nothing alleges that the Sheriff was\n\naware of who was being assaulted, the severity of the assault, or that an inmate\n\nwould have to go to the hospital.” Majority at *31 n. 15. However viewing the\n\nallegations regarding the phone call in the light most favorable to Owens, the phone\n\nconversation contained all of the relevant information. Although the Sheriff may\n\nnot have known Owens’s name, the reasonable inference drawn from a phone call\n\nmade during a serious assault at the jail in which inmates were screaming “They’re\n\n\n                                         69\n\fkilling him up here,” to the Sheriff’s home, in the middle of the night, by the only\n\ndeputy on duty at the Jail, after the local police had refused to help break up the\n\nassault, is that the call was made to inform the Sheriff of the situation and to ask for\n\nher advice and help. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the Sheriff was fully\n\ninformed of the assault on Owens when she refused to come to the Jail, and it does\n\nnot “appear beyond doubt” that Owens would be unable to prove these facts given\n\nthe opportunity to conduct discovery.\n\n      Further, the majority’s refusal to credit Owens’s allegation regarding the\n\ndevelopment and implementation of the policy in effect at the Jail flies in the face\n\nof the bedrock jurisprudential principle that when ruling on a motion to dismiss the\n\nplaintiff’s allegations must be taken as true. See, e.g., Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5\n\n(1980); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319 (1972); Womack v. Runyon, 147 F.3d 1298\n\n(11th Cir. 1998). The majority rejects Owens’s allegation regarding the existence\n\nof a policy stating that unsupported conclusions of law will not prevent a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) dismissal. The existence and content of a policy, or the lack thereof,\n\nhowever, is a factual, not a legal, allegation. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held\n\nthat in reviewing a complaint alleging the existence of a custom or policy, the\n\nplaintiff’s allegations are to be taken as true and no particularized allegations are\n\n\n\n\n                                           70\n\frequired to survive a motion to dismiss.1 See Leatherman v. Tarrant County\n\nNarcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 167-68 (1993).\n\n       Accordingly, I believe Owens alleged sufficient facts to support a reasonable\n\ninference that the Sheriff was aware that Owens was being seriously assaulted and\n\nthat she was aware that Owens would be released from custody – regardless of his\n\ncondition – pursuant to the policy she developed. I agree with the majority that the\n\npolicy is facially constitutional because it could be humanely applied. However,\n\ncontrary to the majority, I believe that, in light of the circumstances that existed at\n\nthe Jail, the policy posed an obvious danger to inmates such that an allegation\n\n\n\n   1\n     Under Supreme Court precedent and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court ruling on\na motion to dismiss is required to accept a plaintiff’s allegations as true and construe those\nallegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. In failing to do so here, the majority\nconflates the degree of specificity required of a complaint to adequately allege a substantive fact\nand the actual substantive facts which must be alleged to state a claim. To the extent that the\nmajority suggests a different standard for pleading in anticipation of the affirmative defense of\nqualified immunity, the Supreme Court has held that “questions regarding pleading . . . are most\nfrequently and most effectively resolved either by the rulemaking process or the legislative\nprocess.” Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 595 (1998) (rejecting attempt to impose\nheightened standard of proof on civil rights claims as unsupported by § 1983 and the Federal\nRules and straying “far from the traditional limits on judicial authority”). Here, although the\nmajority implies that the policy concerns behind qualified immunity justify requiring more\nparticular allegations from Owens’s complaint, “ that is a result which must be obtained by the\nprocess of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.” Leatherman, 507\nU.S. at 168 (“it is impossible to square . . . [a] heightened pleading standard . . . with the liberal\nsystem of ‘notice pleading’ set up by the Federal Rules”). Indeed, when Congress has wished to\nimpose a heightened pleading standard, it has not hesitated to do so, either in the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(a) (imposing heightened pleading standard for\nallegations of fraud and mistake), or by statute, see 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4 et seq. (imposing\nheightened pleading standard for claims under federal securities laws).\n\n\n                                                  71\n\fregarding the existence of the policy leads to the reasonable inference that the\n\nSheriff was aware that the policy posed an excessive risk of harm. Here, the Sheriff\n\nran a jail that was in such poor condition, so understaffed, and so poorly managed\n\nthat the facility itself posed an excessive risk of harm to inmates of which the\n\nSheriff was aware. In such a circumstance, it is inevitable that inmates will be\n\nseriously injured, as Owens was here. A policy of releasing sick and injured\n\ninmates – regardless of the degree of injury – clearly poses an excessive risk of\n\nharm to those inmates and it is reasonable to infer that the Sheriff knew of this risk.\n\nI believe that these facts are sufficient to support a finding of deliberate\n\nindifference.\n\n      I also believe that the law was sufficiently clear at the time of the challenged\n\naction that qualified immunity does not bar civil liability for this claim. Under the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity, government officials sued for damages for injuries\n\narising out the performance of their discretionary functions must be “shown to have\n\nviolated ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\n\nperson would have known.’” Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290 (1999) (quoting\n\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained, “qualified immunity seeks to ensure that defendants ‘reasonably can\n\nanticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability,’ by attaching liability only\n\n\n                                           72\n\fif ‘[t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable\n\nofficial would understand that what he is doing violates that right.’” United States v.\n\nLanier, 520 U.S. 259, 270 (1997) (citations omitted). “This is not to say that an\n\nofficial action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question\n\nhas previously been held unlawful; but it is to say that in the light of preexisting law\n\nthe unlawfulness must be apparent.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n\n(1987) (citations omitted). “This inquiry . . . must be undertaken in light of the\n\nspecific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition . . . .” Saucier v.\n\nKatz, ___ U.S. ___, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 2156 (2001). Thus, “the relevant, dispositive\n\ninquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be\n\nclear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\n\nconfronted.” Id.\n\n      By July 4, 1996, the date of the alleged incident, preexisting law clearly\n\nestablished that Owens was entitled to the medical treatment that the doctors at\n\nStabler Hospital had prescribed for his injuries. The Supreme Court held in 1976\n\nthat deliberate indifference is shown not only by failing to provide prompt attention\n\nto an inmate’s medical needs, but also by “intentionally interfering with treatment\n\nonce prescribed.” Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105; see also Ancata, 769 F.2d at 704.\n\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f      The Eleventh Circuit has applied this principle of “intentional interference\n\nwith prescribed treatment” on numerous occasions. See, e.g., Young v. City of\n\nAugusta, 59 F.3d 1160, 1169 (11th Cir. 1995) (denying summary judgment where\n\nthe evidence indicated that jail officials failed to dispense “the psychotropic drugs\n\nprescribed for her . . . as directed”); Howell v. Evans, 922 F.2d 712 (11th Cir.),\n\nvacated as settled, 931 F.2d 711, 720 (11th Cir.), reinstated by unpublished order\n\n(11th Cir. June 24, 1991) (“the law was clearly established at the time of Howell’s\n\ndeath that if a reasonable official would have known that certain treatment was\n\nnecessary, the refusal to provide or a delay in providing that treatment would\n\nconstitute deliberate indifference and violate Howell’s Eighth Amendment rights”);\n\nWashington v. Dugger, 860 F.2d 1018, 1021 (11th Cir. 1988) (finding that\n\nunavailability of prescribed medication and failure of officials to follow hospital\n\ninstructions for treating inmate were material to determination of officials’\n\ndeliberate indifference); Aldridge v. Montgomery, 753 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir.\n\n1985) (reversing directed verdict for county officials who had failed to give an\n\ninmate, having just received stitches for a cut above his eye, “ice packs and aspirin\n\nprescribed by the doctor for pain upon his return to the jail”).\n\n      Owens alleged that he suffered from “serious medical needs” after being\n\nreleased from the hospital following his assault at the Jail. He claimed that the\n\n\n                                           74\n\fhospital staff “instructed the Sheriff’s Department to follow specific procedures to\n\ncare for his head wounds and other injuries. It instructed them to monitor his level\n\nof consciousness, pupils, vision, and coordination, and to call the hospital\n\nimmediately if any change occurred.” His condition was diagnosed by a physician\n\nas mandating treatment and monitoring, and he was in a great deal of pain.\n\n      Had Owens been left in the hospital or otherwise been released in a manner\n\nthat afforded him access to his prescribed medical treatment, such as with a family\n\nmember or other responsible person, this would be a different case. However, the\n\ncomplaint alleges that rather than adhering to the written instructions they received\n\nwhen signing Owens out of the hospital, the officers released Owens, instructing\n\nhim to sign his own bond, and dropped him off near an interstate outside of a motel\n\nat 3:00 a.m. Owens was barefoot, wearing bloodied clothing, and was severely\n\nswollen and bruised. When he stepped out of the officer’s car, the officer drove\n\naway. Owens was, understandably, unable to secure a room at that motel, and, after\n\nwalking dazedly across the highway, he was also denied entrance to a restaurant.\n\nAt that point, a city police officer picked him up and ordered a clerk at a Holiday\n\nInn to rent a room to Owens. These allegations fit within the preexisting deliberate\n\nindifference case law outlined above and, therefore, Harris is not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity at this stage in the proceedings.\n\n\n                                          75\n\f      Accordingly, I believe that the original panel opinion reached the correct\n\nresult and should be reinstated.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\f",

The Allegations\n\n\n\n       While incarcerated, Plaintiffs Joe Marsh (“Marsh”), a convicted inmate, and\n\nLeroy Owens (“Owens”), a pretrial detainee (together “Plaintiffs”) were assaulted\n\nand injured by other prisoners in the Butler County Jail (the “Jail”). Defendants\n\nButler County, Alabama, and the Butler County Commission were sued as the\n\ngovernment entities responsible under state law for properly maintaining, operating\n\nand funding the Jail.3 Defendant Diane Harris (the “Sheriff”), Sheriff of Butler\n\nCounty, was sued in her individual and official capacities as the party responsible\n\nunder state law for the Jail’s general supervision and control.4 The Sheriff has\n\n   3\n     The Butler County Commission is the governing body of Butler County; so the liability\nanalyses for the two entities are identical. They will be referred to together as the “County” for\nthe remainder of the opinion.\n   4\n     A reader of the complaint may wonder if the complaint actually purports to sue the Sheriff\nin her individual capacity. It does not.\n        According to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), a complaint must contain, “1) a short and plain\nstatement of the grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depends, unless the court already\nhas jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, 2) a short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and 3) a demand for\njudgment for the relief the pleader seeks.”\n        In this case, that part of the complaint which purports to state the claim against Harris\ndoes specifically address the capacity in which the Sheriff is sued. It says these words about\ncapacity: “Defendant Diane Harris is sued in her official capacity as Sheriff of Butler County.”\nThus, the complaint’s “statement of a claim” does not purport to make a claim against the Sheriff\nin her individual capacity.\n        The caption to the complaint contains these words: “Diane Harris, Sheriff of Butler\nCounty, in her individual and official capacity.” But the caption of the complaint is not part of\nthe statement of the claim under Rule 8. The caption is something apart, being mandated by a\ndifferent rule: Fed. R. Civ. P. 10. The caption is chiefly for the court’s administrative\nconvenience. It may, however, sometimes be useful to look at the caption -- when the Rule 8\n\n                                                 6\n\facted as the final policymaker of Butler County for those aspects of jail operation\n\nunder her control.\n\n        In Counts I and II of the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’\n\ndeliberate indifference to the unreasonably dangerous conditions at the Jail\n\ndeprived Plaintiffs of their Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights\n\nunder the United States Constitution. In Count III of the Complaint, Owens claims\n\nthat Defendants’ deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs deprived him\n\nof his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.5\n\n\nstatement of a claim is ambiguous about a party’s capacity -- to settle pleading ambiguities.

To use\nthe Rule 10 caption to create an ambiguity when the statement of the claim is itself not\nambiguous is incorrect.\n         Nevertheless, we accept this case and will decide this case as one in which the complaint\npurports to sue the Sheriff in both her official and individual capacities. The reason is that, in the\ndistrict court, the parties and the district judge clearly litigated the case in that way. The Sheriff,\nfrom the start, advanced the defense of qualified immunity: a defense that is valid only against\nclaims asserted against a government official in her individual capacity. Never did the Sheriff\nchallenge the complaint on the specific ground that it did not even purport to assert a claim\nagainst her except in her official capacity. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b), “[w]hen issues not\nraised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be\ntreated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.” Although Rule 15 uses the\nword “tried,” we accept Rule 15(b) as a guide -- by way of analogy, at the appellate level --\nfor cases never tried, but litigated on motions.\n   5\n     Marsh was a convicted criminal at the Jail and therefore entitled to Eighth Amendment\nprotection.

Because the Jail was understaffed, inmate trustees were given\n\nmany responsibilities for taking care of other inmates and maintaining the\n\noperation of the Jail.\n\n      In August 1995, the jail inspector for the Alabama Department of\n\nCorrections recommended that all Butler County jailers be trained in jail-\n\nmanagement seminars. By the time of the incidents underlying the complaint, few\n\njailers had been so trained. Written procedures did not govern the Jail’s\n\noperations.\n\n      Inmates entering the Jail were not screened for mental impairments or for\n\nwhether they had conflicts with other inmates in the Jail. No system of\n\nclassification existed at the Jail: pretrial detainees were housed with convicted\n\ninmates, nonviolent offenders with violent offenders, juveniles with adults, and\n\nmentally ill persons with those in good mental health. Never were prisoners\n\ndisciplined or segregated for assaulting other inmates, destroying jail property, or\n\nthreatening jailers. The Jail contained four eight-person cells, one four-person cell,\n\n\n                                          9\n\ftrustee cells, two holding cells, one isolation cell and a cell for female inmates; but\n\nsometimes more than 50 inmates were imprisoned at the Jail.\n\n      Jail Administrator Thelma Teague (“Teague”) told the Sheriff several times\n\nthat the Jail needed more staff. In February 1996, the jail inspector for the\n\nAlabama Department of Corrections informed Defendants that the Jail was not\n\nreasonably secure. Defendants also received many complaints and requests for\n\nassistance from prisoners. A letter from prisoner-rights advocates told Defendants\n\nthat the Jail conditions posed “an immediate and serious threat to the safety of the\n\ninmates” and made inmates “highly vulnerable to assault by other inmates.”\n\n      On 2 July 1996, four inmates assaulted Joe Marsh in his cell. He was struck\n\nin the head with a metal pipe, beaten for several minutes, and cut with a\n\nscrewdriver. During the assault other inmates yelled and banged on the walls\n\nattempting to get the attention of jailers. No jailer came upstairs until 10 to 15\n\nminutes after the assault ended. Marsh suffered lacerations across his forehead, on\n\nthe back of his head and on his back. The bone above his eyebrow was broken.\n\nMarsh was taken to a hospital where he received medical treatment for his injuries.\n\nHis left eye now droops, and he has nerve damage in his forehead as a result of the\n\nassault. He continues to suffer from frequent headaches and nightmares.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      The four attackers were never disciplined for the assault on Marsh. Two\n\ndays later (and after the attack on Owens) one of the four attackers discharged a\n\nfire extinguisher into Marsh’s cell where he was resting, nearly suffocating him.\n\n      Owens, a paranoid schizophrenic, was a pretrial detainee who was placed in\n\nthe general population at the Jail. On 3 July 1996, the same four inmates who\n\nassaulted Marsh attacked Owens.\n\n      Owens was attacked in the dayroom on the second floor. He was hit in the\n\nhead with a metal pipe and hit with a watercooler. His head was smashed into a\n\ntable, and he was kicked, stomped, stabbed and beaten for 30 minutes to an hour.\n\nOther inmates called for the jailer to assist Owens. During the assault, the\n\nattackers returned to their cells when they suspected a jailer was on the way. When\n\nthe attackers realized that no help for their victim was coming, they returned to the\n\ndayroom to continue the assault.\n\n      When the assault started, only one jailer was on duty. When he heard the\n\ncries for help he called the Greenville City Police. When the police arrived, they\n\nrefused to go onto the second floor. The jailer called the Sheriff and Jail\n\nAdministrator Teague, but both refused to come to the Jail. Chief Deputy Hartley\n\n(“Hartley”) was called and did come to the Jail.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Twenty minutes after the assault ended, Hartley walked upstairs and brought\n\nOwens downstairs. Owens was taken to a hospital shortly after midnight on 4 July.\n\nHis injuries were treated. Owens was discharged from the hospital to the care of\n\nthe Butler County Sheriff’s Department. Two deputies signed a discharge sheet\n\nwhich instructed them to monitor Owens’s level of consciousness, pupils, vision,\n\nand coordination, and to call the hospital immediately if a change occurred. Back\n\nat the Jail, Hartley instructed Owens to sign his own bond, pursuant to Defendants’\n\npolicy and custom of releasing sick or injured inmates. Hartley then drove Owens\n\nto a motel near the I-65 interstate highway and released him. Owens’s clothes\n\nwere bloody, and he was in his bare feet. The clerks at the motel refused to rent\n\nhim a room and called the police. The police officer who responded to the call\n\nfollowed Owens as he wandered across the I-65 overpass and then ordered the\n\nclerk another motel to rent Owens a room.\n\n      Owens awoke the next day in terrible pain and called his grandmother’s\n\nhouse. His sisters came to the motel where Owens had spent the night. An\n\nambulance was called, and Owens returned to the hospital where a doctor\n\nprescribed pain medication. Because of the assault at the Jail, Owens still\n\nexperiences pain and limited mobility in his right shoulder and uncontrollable\n\nshaking in his right arm.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                         II.    Proceedings in the District Court\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs filed their complaint in 1997. Without filing an answer,\n\nDefendants filed their motions to dismiss. The Sheriff’s motion, among other\n\nthings, asserted qualified immunity. Plaintiffs filed responses to the motions. The\n\nmagistrate judge made his recommendations to grant Defendants’ motions to\n\ndismiss. Plaintiffs filed their objections to the magistrate’s recommendations with\n\nthe district court. The district court adopted, approved and affirmed the magistrate\n\njudge’s recommendations and granted the County’s and the Sheriff’s motions to\n\ndismiss.\n\n\n\n                 III. Claims Against The County for Jail Conditions6\n\n\n\n\n   6\n     We address the claims against the County in detail only for the conditions of confinement.\nPlaintiffs also allege deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious medical needs based on his\nrelease. They make this claim against Defendants in general, which would seem to include the\nCounty. Nothing indicates, however, that the County was involved in the alleged deprivation of\nmedical care to Owens. Moreover, under Alabama law the County is not responsible for\nassuring procedures are in place for inmates to get medical care. Alabama law assigns counties a\n“limited role in building and funding the jails.” See Turquitt v. Jefferson Cty., Ala., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751916\"><a href=\"/opinion/751916/susan-w-turquitt-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-phillip-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc). Therefore, the County is not a responsible party for the\nalleged tort of deliberate indifference to Owens’s medical needs. This claim was properly\ndismissed against the County. Therefore, this opinion will address the deliberate-indifference-\nto-serious-medical-needs claim (Count III) only in the context of the Sheriff’s liability.\n\n                                              13\n\f       The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The\n\nSupreme Court says that prison officials will be liable for violating the Eighth\n\nAmendment when they are deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of serious\n\nharm to inmates. Put differently, officials, to be liable, must be aware of a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the inmates and not take reasonable measures to\n\nalleviate that risk. See Farmer v.

Therefore,\n\n   7\n     The County has the duty to construct and to maintain a jail of sufficient size and strength to\nhouse the inmates. See Ala.Code §§ 11-14-10, 11-14-13 (1989). Looking to Alabama case law\nto define the County’s responsibilities under the statute, we see that “the [Alabama] legislature\nintended to require the county commission to keep a jail and all equipment therein in a state of\nrepair to preserve it from failure or decline.” Keeton v.

Turquitt, 137 F.3d at 1290 (en banc) (concluding no county\n\n                                                14\n\fthe County will have violated Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights if its failure to\n\nmaintain the Jail constituted deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm to the prisoners.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege in the complaint that the physical conditions of the Jail, the\n\nmaintenance of which was the County’s responsibility, presented an objective\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the inmates. They allege the locks on the doors\n\nto cells did not work, preventing inmates from being locked down. The structure\n\nof the Jail was so dilapidated that inmates could fashion weapons from pieces of\n\nthe building. And no video or audio surveillance system was in place to check on\n\nthe inmates.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that the County was aware of the conditions. Plaintiffs say\n\nthese things put the County on notice: a report from the Alabama Department of\n\nCorrections filed in February 1996; faultfinding inspection reports from several\n\nstate agencies; complaints from prisoners; a letter (outlining dangerous conditions)\n\nfrom a prisoner-rights advocacy organization; and a complaint filed in a lawsuit on\n\n14 May 1996, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the prisoners\n\nin the Jail.\n\n\n\nliability for improper operations of the jail).

In\n\naddition, Plaintiffs’ allegations that the County received many reports of the\n\nconditions but took no remedial measures is sufficient to allege deliberate\n\nindifference to the substantial risk of serious harm faced by inmates in the Jail.\n\n      Plaintiffs’ complaint also properly alleges the causal connection between the\n\nCounty’s failure to maintain the Jail and the assaults on Marsh and Owens. For\n\nexample, that the locks on the doors to cells did not work prevented the isolation of\n\nprisoners from each other and gave attackers ready access to Plaintiffs. We\n\nconclude that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a constitutional violation by Butler\n\nCounty to survive the County’s motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n                       IV. The Claims Against Sheriff Harris\n\n\n\nA. Official-Capacity Claims Against the Sheriff\n\n\n\n      Authority over inmates is expressly granted to Alabama Sheriffs. See\n\nTurquitt, 137 F.3d at 1289 (saying “the sheriff has control over the inmates in the\n\n\n                                          16\n\fjail, the employees of the jail, and the jail itself” and the “sheriff [] has the duty to\n\nensure that inmates do not come to harm” (citing Ala. Code § 14-6-1)). The\n\nauthority the Sheriff has over the Jail is totally independent of the county\n\ncommission; so, the “sheriff acts exclusively for the state rather than for the county\n\nin operating a county jail.” Id. at 1288. For this reason, Alabama sheriffs are\n\nconsidered arms of the state and protected by sovereign immunity in suits against\n\nthem in their official capacity. The complaint against the Sheriff in her official\n\ncapacity was thus properly dismissed. The Sheriff can be subject to suit only in her\n\nindividual capacity, to which she might be entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\nB.    Individual-Capacity Claims Against Sheriff Harris for Conditions at the Jail\n      (Counts I and II)\n\n\n      To overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity, Plaintiffs must allege conditions that, in the light of the already clearly\n\nestablished law at the time of the incident, obviously amounted to cruel and\n\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. In the qualified immunity\n\nanalysis, we generally first determine whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for a\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fconstitutional violation at all.

City of Dalton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74654\"><a href=\"/opinion/74654/jerry-m-stanley-v-city-of-dalton-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1285\n\n(11th Cir. 2000).\n\n       A prison official’s deliberate indifference to a known, substantial risk of\n\nserious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment. See Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An Eighth Amendment violation will\n\noccur when a substantial risk of serious harm, of which the official is subjectively\n\naware, exists and the official does not “respond[] reasonably to the risk.” Farmer\n\nv. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1970</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1982-83 (1994). A plaintiff must also show that the\n\nconstitutional violation caused his injuries.\n\n       In Farmer, the Court was chiefly concerned with defining the level of intent\n\nrequired of an official to violate the Eighth Amendment -- the subjective element\n\nof the tort; but Farmer also explained that two objective elements are part of an\n\nEighth Amendment violation. First, an objectively substantial risk of serious harm\n\nto prisoners must exist. See Id. at 1977. Second, once it is established that the\n\nofficial is aware of this substantial risk, the official must react to this risk in an\n\nobjectively unreasonable manner. See Id. at 1983.\n\n       In this case, Plaintiffs allege these conditions at the Jail: 1) there was no\n\nsegregation of nonviolent inmates from violent inmates, pretrial detainees from\n\nconvicted criminals, juveniles from adults, or inmates with mental disorders from\n\n\n                                            18\n\fthose without mental disorders, 2) at times the Jail housed more prisoners than the\n\ncells could accommodate, 3) the Jail was routinely understaffed, 4) no head counts\n\nof prisoners were made to make sure they were all accounted for, 5) locks on cell\n\ndoors were not functional, allowing inmates to roam freely at all hours of the day,\n\n6) homemade weapons were readily available by fashioning weapons from\n\nmaterial torn from the dilapidated structure of the Jail, 7) no lock down of\n\nprisoners in their cells occurred at any point during the day or night, 8) cells were\n\nnot visually inspected, 9) no jailer was assigned to maintain prisoners’ security on\n\nthe second floor where most of the inmates were housed, 10) the Jail was not\n\noperated in accordance with written policies, 11) inmates were not screened for\n\nmental health, medical conditions or conflicts with other prisoners before entering\n\nthe Jail, and 12) prisoners were not disciplined or segregated when they attempted\n\nto escape, threatened jailers, destroyed property or assaulted other inmates.\n\n      Taken as a whole, these alleged conditions, if true, present an objectively\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm -- including the risk of inmate-on-inmate attacks --\n\nto inmates.

In addition, the conditions at\n\nthe Jail are alleged to be longstanding and pervasive. These allegations are\n\nsufficient to plead that the Sheriff was subjectively aware of the substantial risk to\n\ninmate safety at the Jail. See Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1979 (“[T]he official must both\n\nbe aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”).\n\n      Still, a prison official will only violate the Eighth Amendment if the\n\nofficial’s response to the conditions posing the substantial risk of serious harm is\n\nunreasonable. See Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1982-83. Plaintiffs allege that Harris did\n\nabsolutely nothing to alleviate the conditions at the Jail, despite repeated warnings\n\nand recommendations for how conditions could be improved. This alleged lack of\n\naction is not reasonable under the alleged circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f          Plaintiffs also allege that the dangerous conditions caused their injuries.\n\nConditions, like those in this case, where violent prisoners are allowed free reign of\n\na jail with easy access to weapons without proper supervision by guards could be\n\nfound to have caused the assaults on Plaintiffs.\n\n          We conclude that Plaintiffs adequately allege 1) an objective, substantial risk\n\nof serious harm to inmates existed, 2) the Sheriff was subjectively aware of this\n\nrisk, 3) the Sheriff responded in an objectively unreasonable way to this known\n\nrisk, and 4) the constitutional violation caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. Plaintiffs,\n\ntherefore, allege sufficiently that Sheriff Harris violated their Eighth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n          But, the Sheriff, in her individual capacity, might be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity -- barring Plaintiffs’ suit against her -- even if the complaint states an\n\notherwise valid claim for an Eighth Amendment violation.8 See Lassiter v.\n\n   8\n       “A claim of immunity is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff’s claim that\nhis rights have been violated.” Mitchell, 105 S.

If reasonable people could disagree about whether a\nsheriff -- in the light of the then clearly established law -- responded reasonably to the\ncomplaint’s alleged circumstances, qualified immunity must apply: the sheriff has responded in\nan arguably reasonable way. The plaintiff’s allegations on their face show that relief against the\nofficial, in his individual capacity, is barred by the defense of qualified immunity. The law\napplicable to the alleged circumstances facing the official was not already clearly established,\nthat is, a reasonable government official could not truly know when he acted whether the acts\nwere lawful or unlawful under the federal law. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 102 S. Ct. at 2738\n(official could not “fairly be said to ‘know’ that the law forbade conduct not previously\nidentified as unlawful” when law not clearly established).\n         For a court to conclude that -- in the light of the clearly established law at the pertinent\ntime -- a hypothetical jury, considering all the complaint’s alleged facts as true, could decide that\nthe defendant responded unreasonably is not sufficient to overcome the qualified immunity\ndefense raised in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. This formulation is nothing more than saying that\nreasonable people might or might not think -- this is, could disagree about whether -- the\ngovernment actor behaved unreasonably. It is this kind of situation -- that is, one where the\nalleged facts (accepted as true) leave the legal consequences uncertain -- for which the defense\nof qualified immunity was designed.\n         In Hill v.

Two sets of circumstances may\n\nbe “nearly” the same, but “nearly” can make a great legal difference at the edge.\n\nBecause fair and clear notice to government officials is the cornerstone of qualified\n\nimmunity, courts must diligently analyze the preexisting case law to determine\n\nwhether it really did provide plain notice to every reasonable government official\n\nthat the pertinent conduct, in the specific circumstances, would clearly violate\n\npreexisting federal law.\n\n       The deliberate indifference standard of the Eighth Amendment basically\n\nplaces a duty on jailers to act reasonably to keep inmates safe.

Thus, in the\npresent case, when we have denied qualified immunity, we have done so because we believe that\nfact-specific, preexisting case law did put reasonable sheriffs on clear notice given the alleged\ncircumstances.\n         The defense of qualified immunity bars absolutely a judge and jury from making, in\neffect, new law for a case to fit the particular circumstances that faced the public official at the\ntime of the pertinent event and then applying this new law basically retroactively in the case to\nmake an award of damages. If a public official is to be punished by an imposition of damages\nagainst him personally, the punishment must be for violating some clear, legal duty he – in the\nlight of the specific circumstances before him – plainly already had at the time of the pertinent\nevent, and not for violating what is, in effect, some new legal duty recognized or announced by\nthe judge and jury in the official’s trial, long after the time of the pertinent event.\n\n                                                  24\n\fstatute to that imposed by common law duty to take reasonable care saying “[i]t is\n\ntrue we think of the common-law duty as though it were imposed before the event,\n\nbecause it demands only <reasonable’ care; but that does not specify the conduct\n\nrequired and creates a duty incapable of being known in advance, and it is\n\nascertained and imposed only retroactively...it is legislation in parvo [in little]”).\n\n      When the facts of previous precedents are necessary to give clear warning\n\nthat certain conduct in specific circumstances will violate federal law, we must\n\nlook at the facts in the precedent and at the facts that confronted the government\n\nofficial in the case before the court. The two sets of facts must be materially\n\nsimilar. For qualified immunity purposes, a preexisting precedent is materially\n\nsimilar to the circumstances facing an official when the specific circumstances\n\nfacing the official are enough like the facts in the precedent that no reasonable,\n\nsimilarly-situated official could believe that the factual differences between the\n\nprecedent and the circumstances facing the official might make a difference to the\n\nconclusion about whether the official’s conduct was lawful or unlawful, in the light\n\nof the precedent. Thus, every fact need not be identical. But minor variations in\n\nsome facts (the precedent lacks an arguably significant fact or contains an\n\nadditional arguably significant fact not in the circumstances now facing the\n\nofficial) might be very important and, therefore, be able to make the circumstances\n\n\n                                           25\n\ffacing an official materially different from the preexisting precedents, leaving the\n\nlaw applicable -- in the circumstances facing the official -- not clearly established\n\nwhen the defendant official acted.\n\n        To apply properly this “materially similar” principle, the court, surveying\n\nthe relevant area of law, must discern the facts that were material to the federal law\n\nviolation in similar preexisting cases.10 These facts then must be compared to the\n\nfacts alleged in the case before the court. If there is an absence of a fact (or the\n\npresence of an additional fact) in the case before the court, the court must\n\ndetermine whether that fact might make a difference to any reasonable official who\n\nhad to determine whether his conduct violated federal law in the circumstances in\n\nthe immediate case. If the court determines that the variance might make a\n\ndifference, the precedent -- when factual particularity is needed to establish the\n\nlaw -- cannot clearly establish the law applicable to the circumstances facing the\n\ndefendant.\n\n\n\n\n   10\n      When case law is needed to “clearly establish” the law applicable to the pertinent\ncircumstances, we look to decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the highest court of the pertinent state.

In\nWilliams, the court concluded that the totality of the circumstances posed a substantial risk of\n\n                                                 27\n\f       It is true that each of these earlier cases also had, as part of the facts, that the\n\npertinent institution had a history of inmate assaults with serious injuries. And this\n\ncase lacks that alleged fact. But that factual variance cannot make a difference. As\n\nthe Supreme Court had written (before the Plaintiffs were injured in the case), an\n\nEighth Amendment violation can arise from unsafe conditions of confinement even\n\nif no assault or similar physical injury has yet occurred. See Helling, 113 S.Ct. at\n\n2481 (Eighth Amendment protects against sufficiently imminent dangers as well as\n\ncurrent unnecessary and wanton infliction of harm); see also Collier, 501 F.2d at\n\n1300-01 (concluding that risk to inmates posed by exposed electrical wiring,\n\ndeficient firefighting measures and mingling of inmates with contagious diseases\n\nconstituted Eighth Amendment violation even though no showing was made that\n\n\nserious harm due to inmate violence.

In\nCollier, the court concluded that these conditions pose a serious risk of harm to inmates: 1)\npossession of weapons by prisoners, 2) no established procedure for confiscating weapons, 3)\nlack of classification according to severity of offense, 4) no procedure for reporting previous\nassaults, 5) overcrowding, 6) lack of supervision by guards, 7) custodial responsibility assigned\nto incompetent and untrained inmates, and 8) at least 27 reported instances of armed assaults by\ninmates on other inmates.\n        In this case, Plaintiffs allege these things: 1) widespread possession of weapons by\ninmates, 2) weapons were not confiscated from prisoners, 3) no segregation of nonviolent\ninmates from violent inmates, pretrial detainees from convicted criminals, juveniles from adults,\nor inmates with mental disorders from those without mental disorders, 4) no discipline of\ninmates for violent behavior and previous assaults on other inmates, 5) at times the Jail housed\nmore prisoners than the cells could accommodate, 6) the Jail was understaffed, 7) inadequate\nsupervision by jailers, and 8) unsupervised prisoner trustees had custodial duties for other\nprisoners.\n\n                                               28\n\fprisoners had been injured or had contracted disease due to these conditions). See\n\ngenerally Farmer, 114 S.Ct. at 1983 (relief available to plaintiff subjected to\n\nunsafe conditions even if no harm has yet befallen him).\n\n      We conclude, considering the preexisting case law of this circuit (which had\n\ncases with very similar facts) and of the Supreme Court (which made it plain that\n\nlack of physical injury did not mean that no Eighth Amendment violation had been\n\nestablished), that no reasonable sheriff could have concluded that the alleged\n\nconditions at the Jail failed to pose a substantial risk of serous harm, although no\n\nserious injury was alleged to have occurred at the Jail before the injuries suffered\n\nby Plaintiffs. That the alleged jail conditions posed no substantial risk of serious\n\nharm is incapable of being convincingly argued, considering the preexisting law.\n\n      Given that a substantial risk of serious harm was present, an Eighth-\n\nAmendment defendant might still be entitled to qualified immunity on a different\n\nbasis: if he responded in a way that was arguably reasonable -- in the light of the\n\nclearly established preexisting law -- to the substantial risk of serious harm to\n\ninmates. But at the time of the assaults in this case, it was clearly established in\n\nthis Circuit that it is an unreasonable response for an official to do nothing when\n\nconfronted with prison conditions -- like the conditions alleged in this case -- that\n\npose a risk of serious physical harm to inmates.

Owens makes no\n\nallegation that the Sheriff personally participated in Owens’s release. Nor does\n\nOwens allege that the Sheriff was aware of the particular circumstances of\n\nOwens’s medical condition when he was released or of the manner of his release\n\non the night of the assault.14 The Sheriff’s potential liability, therefore, can be only\n\n\n\n\nrights at all, he might have to show the release was done “maliciously and sadistically for the\nvery purpose of causing harm.” See generally Id. at 1978. What standard is applicable seems\nquestionable. We leave the question undecided because it has not been raised, argued or briefed\nin this case. We also do not take into account the debatable nature of this most basic question\nwhen we write about whether the law was clearly established for the purposes of qualified\nimmunity.\n   14\n      The complaint does allege that the Sheriff was called by a deputy during the assault of\nOwens at the Jail and that the Sheriff did not come to the Jail. The Chief Deputy came. Nothing\nalleges that the Sheriff was aware of who was being assaulted, the severity of the assault, or that\nan inmate would have to go to the hospital. According to the complaint, Owens received\nmedical care after the time of the call to the Sheriff. There is no allegation that the Sheriff was\naware of Owens’s condition after he received the medical care at the hospital or aware that\nOwens was going to be released from the Jail or that the Sheriff refused to listen or to confer\nwith the Chief Deputy about whether or how Owens should be released.\n\n                                                31\n\fpolicymaker liability. But the complaint is insufficient to state a claim against the\n\nSheriff as a policymaker.15\n\n        Owens alleges that the Sheriff had a “policy of releasing sick or injured\n\ninmates,” and concluded that the policy was “developed and implemented... with\n\ndeliberate indifference to the medical needs of Owens after his assault.”16 Owens\n\nalleges no facts from which a fact-finder could find that the Sheriff actually knew\n\n\n\n\n   15\n      Before the complaint was dismissed, Plaintiffs were on notice that they might not have\nsufficiently alleged that the Sheriff was deliberately indifferent to Owens’s medical needs. The\nSheriff’s motion to dismiss argued that Plaintiffs failed to allege a constitutional violation\nbecause they failed to allege “personal participation,” or “any type of policy she enacted which\ncaused the injuries.”\n        The magistrate judge’s recommendations concluded that Plaintiffs failed to allege an\nEighth Amendment violation. Plaintiffs filed objections to the magistrate judge’s\nrecommendation but did not seek to amend the complaint. Even after the district court dismissed\ntheir claims, Plaintiffs did not seek to amend the complaint.

He\n\nalleges no past pattern of inmate releases that, if proved, might support that this\n\nSheriff had a policy or custom of releasing inmates with deliberate indifference to\n\ntheir serious medical needs.\n\n      For similar reasons, Owens has failed to allege sufficient facts showing that\n\nthe Sheriff can be held personally liable for inadequate training about the manner\n\nof releasing sick or injured inmates. Unless a policymaker knows of the need to\n\ntrain an officer in a particular subject area, no liability can arise from failure to\n\ntrain him. See Gold v.

The\n\ncomplaint does say, when describing the general jail conditions, that the state\n\ncorrections department had “recommended” that all jail employees be trained at jail\n\nmanagement seminars and that, by 1996, “almost no one who worked at the jail --\n\n\n                                            35\n\fincluding the sheriff, the jail administrators, and most jailers” had been\n\nprofessionally trained. But the complaint allegations never say that Chief Deputy\n\nHartley did not have the recommended professional training. And the complaint\n\nnever says that the “on the job” training for release of inmates was inadequate.\n\nMoreover, the complaint does not say that Chief Deputy Hartley released Owens in\n\nthe manner he did because of inadequate training. Furthermore, the complaint does\n\nnot allege facts indicating that the Sheriff knew that Deputy Hartley’s lack of\n\ntraining (if any) about releasing inmates posed an excessive risk of serious harm to\n\ninmates. And from the well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint, no\n\ninferences can be reasonably drawn to make up for the missing facts. “[P]leadings\n\nmust be something more than an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable.”\n\nUnited States v.

For Count III, Owens has failed to state a claim for a constitutional\n\nviolation against the Sheriff personally -- as a policymaker.\n\n      Even if the complaint did state a claim against the Sheriff for a constitutional\n\nviolation on account of the policy of releasing sick or injured inmates, we -- in the\n\nalternative -- conclude that the Sheriff would be entitled to qualified immunity. To\n\n\n                                          36\n\fdefeat the Sheriff’s qualified immunity defense, Owens must show that the\n\npreexisting applicable law was so clearly established in July 1996 that every\n\nreasonable Sheriff would have known that releasing sick and injured inmates\n\nwould violate the constitutional rights of inmates. This legal clarity did not exist.\n\n      The Constitution, on its face, says nothing about medical care due inmates.\n\nThe right to medical care was inferred by the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Estelle v.\n\nGamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290 (1976); Helling, 113 S.Ct. at 2480. And the scope of\n\nthat right is, therefore, necessarily defined by case law. In July 1996, no case law\n\nestablished that releasing a sick or injured prisoner violated a constitutional right to\n\nreceive care for a serious medical condition. To the best of our knowledge, no\n\nreported decision in this country had ever held such a thing.\n\n      In Estelle, the Supreme Court interpreted the Eighth Amendment’s words\n\nagainst “cruel and unusual punishments,” and, for the first time, determined that\n\ngovernments -- presented with an inmate with a serious medical condition -- had an\n\n“obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by\n\nincarceration.” Estelle, 975 S.Ct. at 290. The Court reasoned that, “[a]n inmate\n\nmust rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if authorities fail to do\n\nso, those needs will not be met.” Id. Under Estelle, the critical fact supporting the\n\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\fobligation on the government is the fact of incarceration: the prisoner cannot get\n\nhis own care, nor can anyone from outside the jail get to him to help him.\n\n      In 1989, the Supreme Court restated this rationale -- the importance of\n\nconfinement -- in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

See also DeShaney, 1074 S.Ct. at\n\n1005.\n\n        In each of the cases in this line, the main fact is the fact of continuing\n\nincarceration of a sick or injured inmate.18 And whatever was written in the\n\nopinions should be read in the context of the fact of continuing incarceration. “It is\n\na maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be\n\ntaken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.” Cohens v.\n\nVirginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) (1821) (Marshall, C.J.).\n\n        In none of these earlier cases was the inmate complaining about his total\n\nrelease from confinement. “Release from confinement” is a highly material fact\n\nfor Count III in this case. So, this case is materially different from every case cited\n\nby Plaintiffs or found by us, particularly cases decided before July 1996.\n\nConsidering the absence of preexisting precedent dealing with the release of sick or\n\ninjured inmates, we must conclude that a reasonable sheriff, in July 1996, could\n\ndetermine that the fact of his having a policy of releasing sick or injured inmates --\n\n   18\n      Plaintiffs also point out a number of Eleventh Circuit cases that are part of the same line.\nPlaintiffs argue these cases clearly established that “intentional interference with prescribed”\ntreatment amounts to a constitutional violation.

Fewer than two months before the\n\nincidents underlying this case, a federal district judge in California had written -- in\n\na reasoned opinion -- that a sick prisoner who was released on parole had no claim\n\nfor denial of medical care because, “[a]t the time of his parole, plaintiff was not\n\nsuffering from a ‘deprivation of liberty’ that precluded him from obtaining medical\n\ncare; accordingly, plaintiff had no constitutional guarantee of State-provided\n\n\n\n\n   19\n      Plaintiffs cite a case decided in 1998 from the Sixth Circuit concluding that police officers\nwere not entitled to qualified immunity when they released a vagrant whom they had arrested\nearlier in the evening for public drunkenness.

Besides the fact that Davis is not a decision binding in this circuit and was decided close\nto two years after Owens’s release, Davis involved no claim of deliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs. Furthermore, in Davis, unlike in this case, the Defendants were not the local-\ngovernment employer or the supervisors of the police: not policymakers sued as such. In Davis,\nthe defendants were the specific police officers who actually released plaintiff (when he was\ndrunk) at a dangerous place.

By releasing a\n\nprisoner (for example, at a public place), a sheriff can enable the prisoner to obtain\n\ncare from other sources (something that eventually happened in this very case). A\n\nreasonable Sheriff in 1996 could believe that releasing sick and injured inmates\n\nwas lawful. The “fact of confinement” in the preexisting cases limited the duty of\n\njailers and -- more important for qualified immunity purposes -- removed the\n\n\n\n   20\n       We take seriously the idea of “clearly established.” When, around the pertinent time, a\ndistrict judge is writing that a kind of conduct does not violate the Constitution at all, we need to\nbe particularly careful before concluding that the law was already truly clearly established to be\nthe opposite of the judge’s opinion.

Id. at 1162. The material facts in Wakefield differ from the\nmaterial facts in this case.

The Sheriff therefore is entitled to\n\nimmunity for her policy of releasing sick and injured inmates.21\n\n\n\n\n                                        V. Conclusion\n\n\n\n        From the complaint’s allegations, we conclude that Plaintiffs have\n\nsufficiently stated a claim against the County and the Sheriff for the conditions at\n\nthe Butler County Jail. We also conclude that Plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged\n\nthat the Sheriff personally is liable for deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious\n\nmedical needs. In addition, we conclude that the Sheriff in her official capacity is\n\n   21\n      We need not reach the question of whether the Sheriff might be entitled to qualified\nimmunity on other, more specific, grounds. For example, preexisting cases had not yet defined,\neven generally, the point at which some risk of harm becomes -- by virtue of the circumstances\nsurrounding a policy to release sick or injured inmates -- “a substantial risk of serious harm” for\nthe purposes of the law. We need not focus so finely, considering the law was not clearly\nestablished at an even higher level of generality, that is, on whether a release from confinement\ncould violate the Federal Constitution at all.\n\n                                                42\n\fimmune from suit. Moreover, we conclude that, if the allegations against the\n\nSheriff are otherwise sufficient to state a claim, the Sheriff in her individual\n\ncapacity is immune from suit for deliberate indifference to Owens’s serious\n\nmedical needs.\n\n\n\n      The district court’s order is REVERSED, except for the dismissal of all\n\nclaims against the Sheriff in her official capacity and for the dismissal of the claims\n\nagainst the County and the Sheriff, in her individual capacity, on deliberate\n\nindifference to Owens’s serious medical needs.\n\n      The case is REMANDED for further proceedings on Counts I and II.\n\n\n\n      REVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which\nBARKETT, MARCUS and WILSON, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n         I concur in the court’s judgment reversing the district court’s determination\n\nthat the Sheriff is immune from suit for the injuries Marsh and Owens received as a\n\nresult of the brutal assaults they suffered at the Butler County Jail.1 I dissent,\n\nhowever, from the majority’s holding that the doctrine of qualified immunity bars\n\nthe Count III claim for the injuries Owens suffered after Chief Deputy Phillip\n\nHartley released him from the jail and – in total disregard of the hospital’s\n\ndischarge instructions that “the Sheriff’s Department follow specific procedures to\n\ncare for Owens’ head wounds and . . . monitor his level of consciousness, pupils,\n\nvision, and coordination, and to call the hospital immediately if any change\n\noccurred”2 – abandoned him, shoeless and in bloody clothing, in front of the Thrifty\n\nInn motel on the edge of town, at Exit 128 on Interstate Highway 65.3 As I read the\n\nmajority opinion, the Sheriff cannot be held to answer for Owens’ injuries because\n\n\n   1\n       The Jail is located in the City of Greenville, the county seat of Butler County.\n   2\n       See paragraph 53 of the complaint, which is attached to this opinion as an Appendix.\n   3\n     The internet site Mapquest pinpoints the location of the Thrifty Inn at Exit 128 on I-65.\nMapquest (visited Sept. 22, 2001 <http://www.mapquest.com>). The Rand McNally Road Atlas\nshows that I-65 bypasses Greenville, and that Exit 128 is beyond Greenville’s city limits.\nAlthough these facts are not alleged with such precision in the complaint, the complaint does\nallege that after Hartley let Owens out of his car at the Thrifty Inn and drove away, the clerks at\nthe Inn refused to give him a room, and when a Waffle House restaurant nearby also provided no\nhelp, Owens wandered onto I-65. We should take judicial notice of the location of the City of\nGreenville, I-65, and the Thrifty Inn, since these facts could not reasonably be disputed.\n\n                                                   44\n\f(1) she had no notice of Owens’ release from the jail, (2) she did not participate in\n\nany way in Owens’ release and subsequent abandonment, and (3) she cannot be\n\nheld liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for Hartley’s inexcusable\n\nconduct.\n\n      After reading the facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom, as Rule 12(b)(6) requires, I conclude that the failure of the\n\ncomplaint to allege that the Sheriff actually knew of Owens’ medical condition, the\n\ndischarge instructions the hospital had given Chief Deputy Hartley and Deputy\n\nSheriff Benny Lowery, and Owens’ release from the jail and subsequent\n\nabandonment at the Thrifty Inn is entirely irrelevant. What is relevant is how the\n\nSheriff handled inmate assaults – in particular, how she handled those who, like\n\nMarsh and Owens, were seriously injured. I thus turn first to her handling of inmate\n\nassaults.\n\n      What the facts – alleged and reasonably inferred – show is that the Sheriff did\n\nabsolutely nothing to prevent inmate assaults at the jail. As the majority\n\nacknowledges, given the jail’s configuration and the lack of security, with only one\n\njailor on duty most of the time, assaults were not only inevitable, they were\n\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\froutine.4 In Marsh’s case, the inmates who committed the assault were not\n\ndisciplined (they should have been prosecuted for committing a felony); instead,\n\nthey were permitted to retain their weapons (they assaulted Owens with the pipe\n\nthey used to assault Marsh), and they were given a free run on the second floor.5 In\n\nother words, the inmates had a green light to commit mayhem with impunity. The\n\nmajority properly concludes that this constituted the Sheriff’s “custom or policy”\n\nfor dealing with inmate assaults – notwithstanding the fact that the custom or policy\n\nhad not been reduced to writing, and the complaint does not spell it out as such. I\n\nnow turn to the Sheriff’s handling of the victims of inmate assaults who received\n\nserious injuries.\n\n         If the victim was a sentenced prisoner, the inmate, after receiving the\n\nnecessary medical treatment, would be returned to the jail and would remain there\n\n(unless, and until, transported to a state prison facility). This is what happened in\n\nMarsh’s case. He was severely beaten, and then taken to the emergency room at\n\n   4\n     I say that inmate assaults routinely took place because such can be inferred from the\nmultiple complaints lodged against the Sheriff by authorities responsible for overseeing prison\nand jail conditions in Alabama and the lawsuit pending against her in the United States District\nCourt for the Middle District of Alabama. The majority properly acknowledges that these\ncomplaints, which are described in paragraphs 27 through 29 of the complaint, preceded the\nassaults against Marsh and Owens. I also infer that the assaults routinely took place from what\nthe jailors – Sabrena Stone and Preston Nicholson – did, and did not do, once they became aware\nthat the beatings Marsh and Owens sustained in this case were taking place.\n   5\n       See Appendix paragraphs 17, 37, 47.\n\n\n                                               46\n\fStabler Hospital. After being treated in the emergency room, he was returned to the\n\njail and placed in a holding cell – to separate him from his assailants.6 If the inmate\n\nhappened to be a pretrial detainee – meaning that a court had denied him admission\n\nto bail – the Sheriff would ignore the fact that a judge had ordered him detained7\n\nand would release the detainee on his own recognizance.8 This is what happened in\n\nOwens’ case.9 Owens had been ordered detained,10 but Chief Deputy Sheriff\n\nHartley nonetheless released him. The inference, I submit, is inescapable, not\n\nmerely permissible – that Hartley, in releasing an inmate who had been ordered\n\ndetained, and then abandoning him in front of the Thrifty Inn at 3:30 in the\n\n\n   6\n       See Appendix paragraph 39.\n   7\n     As noted in the text infra, under Alabama law, a person charged with a misdemeanor is\nentitled as a matter of right to release on his own recognizance or an appearance bond unless a\ncourt orders him detained. Ala. R. Crim. P. 7.2(a).\n   8\n     The majority opinion is silent concerning the lawfulness of the Sheriff’s alleged “policy and\ncustom releasing sick or injured inmates.” See Appendix paragraph 54. It would be unlawful\nfor the Sheriff to release a sentenced inmate prior to the completion of his sentence or his release\non parole. This is why the Sheriff did not release Marsh. On discharge from the hospital, Marsh\nwas taken back to the jail and detained until August 6, 1996, when he was transported to a state\ncorrectional institution. See Appendix paragraph 9. It would also be unlawful for the Sheriff to\nrelease a pretrial detainee, for to release him would violate the court order requiring the Sheriff\nto detain him.\n   9\n       See Appendix paragraph 54.\n   10\n      The complaint alleges that Owens occupied the status of a pretrial detainee. See Appendix\nparagraph 41. We must assume, therefore, as I establish in Subpart A, infra, that a court had\ndenied him admission to bail and ordered his detention (in the Butler County Jail) – until further\norder of the court.\n\n\n                                                 47\n\fmorning, was not acting on his own; instead, he was acting pursuant to the Sheriff’s\n\ncustom or policy – notwithstanding the fact that it had not been reduced to writing\n\nand the complaint does not spell it out as such.\n\n        This inference is inescapable – that is, a fair minded jury could reasonably\n\ndraw it – when one focuses, first, on Hartley’s, and to a lesser extent Lowery’s,\n\nconduct from the moment Owens was discharged from the hospital until Hartley\n\nabandoned him in front of the Thrifty Inn, and, second, on the facts that led the\n\nmajority to conclude that the Sheriff was not entitled to qualified immunity from\n\nsuit for the beatings Marsh and Owens sustained at the jail. Hartley’s conduct\n\nshould not be considered in isolation. Why Hartley did what he did is explained in\n\nlarge part by how the Sheriff ran the jail and, in particular, by what took place there\n\nbetween Marsh’s assault on July 1 and Owens’ assault two and a half days later.11\n\n        In Part I, I set forth – from the facts alleged in the complaint and from the\n\npermissible inferences they yield – what took place upon and after Owens’\n\ndischarge from the hospital. From those facts and inferences, I posit, in Subpart A,\n\nthat one of two things occurred: either Hartley was acting on his own when he\n\nreleased Owens from custody and then abandoned him at the Thrifty Inn, or, as I\n\n   11\n     Marsh’s assault took place in the afternoon of July 1, while Jailor Stone, who worked the\nday shift, was on duty. Owens’ assault took place between 11:00 p.m. and midnight on July 3,\nwhile Jailor Nicholson was on duty.\n\n\n                                               48\n\fconclude, he was acting pursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy. I do so because,\n\nas depicted in Subpart B (and in the majority opinion), the events that took place\n\nbefore Owens’ discharge from the hospital point inexorably to the proposition that\n\nHartley acted not on his own, but pursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy.\n\n                                          A.\n\n          Owens was a pretrial detainee, charged with a misdemeanor. Under\n\nAlabama law, a person charged with a misdemeanor “as a matter of right may be\n\nreleased pending or during trial on his or her personal recognizance or on an\n\nappearance bond unless the court or magistrate determines that such a release will\n\nnot reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance.” ALA. R. CRIM. P. 7.2(a).\n\nOwens’ pretrial detainee status therefore meant that a court or magistrate had\n\ndenied him release. The circumstances surrounding his incarceration – from the\n\ntime he entered the jail until Hartley released him in the early morning of July 4 –\n\nfully evidences the fact that Owens had been ordered detained. Had he been\n\ngranted release on his own recognizance, Owens would have signed his bond on\n\nJuly 1 and walked out of the jail. He would have done so because he feared for his\n\nsafety. On July 2 or 3, after having been harassed by other inmates, he asked Jailor\n\nStone to put him in a solitary cell. She refused his request.12 Moreover, had he\n\n   12\n        See Appendix paragraph 45.\n\n\n                                          49\n\fbeen entitled to leave on his own recognizance, his uncle, who came to the jail with\n\nhis medicine on July 2 (after his grandmother had spoken to the jailor on duty),\n\nwould have obtained his release.13 Thus, as of the time he suffered the assault –\n\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and midnight on July 3 – and as of the time of his release – at\n\n3:30 a.m. on July 4 – Owens’ status as a pretrial detainee had not been altered.\n\nChief Deputy Hartley obviously knew this; that is why he rushed Owens to “sign\n\nhis own bond” less than twenty minutes after his discharge from the hospital.\n\nHartley was in such a hurry to get Owens out of the jail and out of town that he did\n\nnot pause to retrieve Owens’ shoes or find something for him to wear.14 I return to\n\nthat point later.\n\n         Hartley came to the jail while Owens was being assaulted or shortly\n\nthereafter;15 he was the only person in the Sheriff’s office to accept Nicholson’s\n\nplea for help. Nicholson, on duty alone at the jail, “called the Greenville City\n\nPolice. Two city police officers arrived, but refused to go upstairs. Nicholson then\n\n\n\n   13\n        See Appendix paragraph 43.\n   14\n      I realize that the complaint did not allege this in the manner I have set out. I am convinced,\nhowever, that a competent lawyer would be entitled to argue the point to a jury notwithstanding\nthe Sheriff’s objection.\n   15\n     The complaint does not fix the precise moment of his arrival at the jail. It had to be,\nhowever, before an ambulance came to transport Owens to the hospital at 12:17 a.m. on July 4.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fcalled Sheriff Harris and Jail Administrator Thelma Teague. Both refused to come\n\nto the jail.”16 When the county’s chief law enforcement officer refused to become\n\ninvolved, Nicholson turned to Chief Deputy Hartley.17\n\n           The brutal assault on Owens by four inmates – the same four who assaulted\n\nMarsh on July 1 – began sometime between 11p.m. and midnight on July 3 and\n\nlasted between thirty to sixty minutes.18 It was, under Alabama law, an assault in\n\nthe first degree,19 if not attempted murder.20 The assailants suspended the assault\n\n16\n     See Appendix paragraph 49.\n      17\n        The inferences here are either (1) that Nicholson called Hartley pursuant to the Sheriff’s\ninstructions or (2) that the Sheriff gave Nicholson no instructions, so he called Hartley on his\nown initiative. The first inference supports the ultimate inference that Hartley was acting\npursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy. However, not until the plaintiff is able to interrogate\nNicholson and the Sheriff under oath will the truth be known. Under the majority’s approach to\nthe problem, plaintiff’s counsel should have alleged the first inference as a fact. In that\nplaintiff’s adversary has possession of all of the evidence on the point, how counsel could make\nsuch an allegation without violating Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure escapes me.\n18\n     See Appendix paragraphs 49, 50.\n      19\n           ALA. CODE § 13A-6-20 (2001) defines assault in the first degree as:\n                 (a) A person commits the crime of assault in the first\n                 degree if:\n                 (1) with intent to cause serious physical injury to another\n                 person, he causes serious physical injury to any person\n                 by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument;\n                 or\n                 ...\n                 (3) under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference\n                 to the value of human life, he recklessly engages in\n                 conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another\n                 person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to any\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fon several occasions upon hearing the rustling of keys but continued to beat Owens\n\n“[w]hen they realized that no one was coming upstairs.”21 Twenty minutes after the\n\nincident, Hartley retrieved Owens, who “lay in a pool of blood on the dayroom\n\nfloor.”22 Owens’ injuries were serious and an ambulance was called to the scene; at\n\n12:17 a.m., it transported Owens to Stabler Hospital.23 He was received in the\n\nemergency room and treated there for nearly three hours, until 3:10 a.m., when\n\nChief Deputy Hartley and Deputy Lowery regained his custody. To obtain Owens’\n\ncustody, they had to sign a discharge sheet which stated that Owens was being\n\n\n                 person.\n      20\n     Under ALA. CODE § 13A-6-2 (2001), a person commits murder if:\n           (1) With intent to cause the death of another person, he\n           causes the death of that person or of another person . . . .\nALA. CODE § 13A-4-2 (2001) defines attempt as follows:\n           (a) a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if,\n           with the intent to commit a specific offense, he does any\n           overt act towards the commission of such offense.\n           ...\n           (d) An attempt is a:\n           (1) Class A felony if the offense attempted is murder.\n\nAt one point during the assault on Owens, an inmate called Jailor Nicholson for\nhelp, yelling “they’re killing him up here.” See Appendix paragraph 48.\n\n21\n     See Appendix paragraph 50.\n22\n     See Appendix paragraphs 51, 52.\n23\n     See Appendix paragraph 52.\n\n\n                                         52\n\fdischarged into the custody of the “Sheriff’s Department” with instructions “to\n\nfollow specific procedures to care for Owens’ head wounds and other injuries[,] . . .\n\nto monitor his level of consciousness, pupils, vision, and coordination, and to call\n\nthe hospital immediately if any change occurred.”24 A fair-minded jury would\n\nreadily infer from the allegation that the two deputies “signed a discharge sheet”\n\nthat they had read and understood the instructions it contained. The jury would also\n\ninfer the deputies, in signing the discharge sheet, the deputies represented, and the\n\nemergency room physician assumed, that Owens would remain in the custody of the\n\nSheriff’s Department.25\n\n           This representation was false, and it was false when made. Chief Deputy\n\nHartley never intended to have Owens monitored by the Sheriff’s Department – at\n\nthe Butler County Jail or any other facility. Why? Because moments after he and\n\nLowery arrived back at the jail, he instructed Owens “to sign his own bond,”26 and\n\nthen took him to the edge of town, let him out at the Thrifty Inn and drove away.27\n\n\n24\n     See Appendix paragraph 53.\n      25\n     Can it be doubted that the discharge instructions were written by a physician? Since\nOwens was not admitted to the hospital proper, the physician had to be the doctor on duty in the\nemergency room.\n26\n     See Appendix paragraph 54.\n      27\n    Hartley did not even wait to see whether the Thrifty Inn would give Owens a room. We\nknow this because, after denying Owens a room, someone at the motel called the Greenville\n\n\n                                               53\n\fAll of this – from Owens’ discharge from the hospital to the arrival at the motel –\n\ntook no more than twenty minutes. How anxious was Hartley to get rid of Owens?\n\nHe was so anxious that he did not so much as bother to retrieve Owens’ shoes or get\n\nhim a change of clothing; he took Owens to the Thrifty Inn in the same horrible\n\ncondition in which he found Owens after the assault, and did not wait to see\n\nwhether he could get a room there. He simply let Owens out of the car and drove\n\noff. What does Hartley’s conduct imply? The possible inferences are (1) that he\n\ncommitted this reprehensible conduct entirely on his own, or (2) that he was acting\n\npursuant to the Sheriff’s custom or policy or explicit directions.28\n\n        If Hartley acted on his own, then he chose to lie to the emergency room\n\nphysician who told him and Lowery that he would not discharge Owens unless the\n\nSheriff’s office would agree to monitor his condition and to call the hospital if he\n\n\n\nPolice. See Appendix paragraph 55. By this time, Owens was out in the night fending for\nhimself.\n   28\n      Another inference is that Hartley thought that having Owens sign “his own bond” relieved\nhim, and the Sheriff, of the obligation to care for Owens’ serious medical needs in accordance\nwith the hospital’s discharge instructions. In other words, he could vitiate the instructions, and\nhis (and Lowery’s) representation – in signing the discharge sheet and by releasing Owens on his\nown recognizance. Attempting to avoid his, and the Sheriff’s, obligation to monitor Owens’\ncondition and report any untoward changes to the hospital would, in my view, be disingenuous.\nI doubt that a jury would infer that Hartley conjured such a scheme of avoidance between 3:10\nand 3:30 in the morning, and therefore reject the scheme as a permissible inference from the\nfacts alleged in the complaint.\n\n\n\n                                                54\n\ftook a turn for the worse. There can be no doubt that he lied to the emergency room\n\nphysician because the moment he arrived back at the jail, after having Owens sign\n\nhis bond, he turned around and headed out of town, letting Owens out at the Thrifty\n\nInn. Hartley not only lied to the physician, but he ignored the fact that a court had\n\nordered Owens detained. Why would the Sheriff’s Chief Deputy do such things?\n\nWhat incentive would he have to lie to the emergency room doctor,29 to disregard a\n\ncourt order, and, perhaps worst of all, to treat a human being as cruelly as he treated\n\nOwens? If the Greenville Police had not found Owens staggering on the I-65\n\noverpass, he could have been hit by a car and killed. A fair minded jury would find\n\nthat Hartley did such things – as utterly reprehensible and contemptuous as they\n\nwere – to keep his job. Under no circumstances would he do such things on his\n\nown. If he did, the Sheriff would fire him. Her explanation to the judge who had\n\nordered Owens detained would be that she had nothing to do with Hartley’s\n\n\n\n   29\n       I would dare say that, if his deposition is taken in this case, which will surely be done, the\nemergency room physician – in describing the seriousness of Owens’ injuries – will certainly\nemphasize the importance of the discharge instructions he gave Hartley and Lowery and relate in\nfull the conversation he had with these officers before he allowed them to take Owens away.\nOne does not have to be clairvoyant to picture what the doctor will say when asked – by the\nSheriff’s lawyers – whether Owens was in any condition to be taken out of town and left at the\nfront door of a motel along I-65 to fend for himself. Armed with the majority opinion, which\ngrants the Sheriff qualified immunity for Hartley’s conduct, the Sheriff’s lawyers will no doubt\nobject that the examination of the emergency room physician I posit would be improper. Their\nobjection should be ruled out of order; the examination I posit will constitute evidence\nconcerning the extent of the injuries Owens received at the jail.\n\n\n                                                 55\n\fdisregard of his detention order, and that he had been fired. In addition to losing his\n\njob, Hartley would leave himself wide open for a suit for damages. No, Hartley was\n\nfollowing the Sheriff’s custom or policy.30 If there is any doubt, the events that\n\ntook place before Hartley came on the scene should remove it.\n\n                                               B.\n\n        The majority properly acknowledges the deplorable conditions at Butler\n\nCounty Jail countenanced by Sheriff Harris. Her actions, or lack thereof, were so\n\negregious that every judge of this en banc court has voted to deny the Sheriff\n\nimmunity from suit despite the absence of a Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit case\n\non all fours that would have placed her on notice that her operation of the jail – top\n\nto bottom – constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments. No such notice is required where it would be\n\nobvious to anyone standing in the Sheriff’s shoes that her operation of the jail\n\n\n\n\n   30\n       I posit that, during the pretrial discovery that ensues once this case is returned to the\ndistrict court – especially the depositions of the Sheriff, Hartley, and those who operate Stabler\nHospital – plaintiff’s counsel will determine who would have been responsible for paying the\nbill if Owens had been admitted to the hospital. If the Sheriff would have been responsible,\nperhaps this might explain why Hartley and Lowery were willing to sign the discharge sheet and\nwhy Hartley abandoned Owens at the Thrifty Inn. In other words, the Sheriff’s standing orders\nwere to avoid having an assaulted inmate admitted to the hospital. In Owens’ case, implicit in\nthe monitoring instructions the emergency room physician gave the deputies is the fact that, had\nthey told the doctor that the Sheriff’s office was not going to obey the instructions, Owens would\nnot have been permitted to leave the hospital.\n\n\n                                                56\n\ftrampled upon the constitutional rights of sentenced inmates and pretrial\n\ndetainees.31\n\n        The building was in such a state of disrepair that inmates were able to fashion\n\nmakeshift weapons by cannibalizing parts of the decaying building. The locks on\n\nthe cell doors did not function, and as a result, inmates were not kept in distinct\n\nberths, but instead were free to roam with no classification to divide pretrial\n\ndetainees from convicted felons or violent offenders from nonviolent ones. Instead\n\nof making up for structural deficiencies with increased monitoring, the Sheriff\n\nallowed the facility to remain grossly understaffed and technologically deficient.\n\nThe inmate population was often controlled by a single jailor who was also\n\nresponsible for intake and release, monitoring the perimeter, as well as\n\nadministrative tasks such as coordinating mail, food service, medication, and\n\nphones.\n\n        That aggravated assaults by inmates had become acceptable is further\n\nevidenced by the conduct of the jailor in charge during the Marsh and Owens\n\nassaults. From the complaint, we can glean that one jailor worked the day shift and\n\none manned the night shift at the Butler County Jail. Sabrena Stone was on duty\n\n   31\n     While no on-all-fours-case from the Supreme Court or this court put the Sheriff on notice,\nshe nonetheless had plenty of notice from other quarters, not the least of which was a lawsuit\npending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. See supra note 4.\n\n\n                                               57\n\fduring the attack on Marsh; Nicholson was on duty during the assault on Owens.\n\nOn each occasion the jailor – Stone on July 1, and Nicholson on July 3 – waited\n\nuntil the attack was over to rescue the victim despite loud calls (from the victim and\n\nother inmates) for help. When attackers realized that no help for their victim was\n\ncoming, they returned to the dayroom to continue the assault. The assailants could\n\nconfidently continue their crimes knowing that they would not face legal\n\npunishment or any negative consequence within the jail. Neither Stone nor\n\nNicholson took any steps to bring the assailants to justice or to deter future\n\noccurrences of violence, nor did Investigator Harden, who took Marsh to the\n\nhospital, or Hartley or Lowery, who ministered to Owens. Indeed, the assailants\n\nhad a “green light.” The inferences that can be drawn from all of this are, first, that\n\nthe Sheriff was not going to charge any assailant, and, second, that her subordinates\n\nwere aware of her policy and therefore acted accordingly.\n\n      In sum, I submit that when one considers Chief Deputy Hartley’s conduct\n\nafter he surreptitiously obtained Owens’ release from the Stabler Hospital in the\n\nlight of what transpired at the jail beforehand, the inference is inescapable that\n\nHartley acted at the Sheriff’s behest.

How can it be argued that Chief Deputy Sheriff Hartley was not the\n\nSheriff’s agent?\n\n                                           II.\n\n      The proper use of Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is at\n\nstake in this case. The majority shows abject disregard for the Rule’s command\n\nrequiring us to accept all alleged facts as true and then draw from those facts as\n\nmany inferences favorable to the plaintiff as possible. Instead, the majority turns\n\na blind eye to context and considers each fact in isolation, in effect destroying any\n\nchance for a properly pled (circumstantial evidence) claim to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n      The traditional strategy for defeating a circumstantial evidence case – on the\n\npleadings, or on summary judgment, or at trial – is to isolate the facts alleged, or\n\nproven, and then say: what does this prove? Of course, it may prove nothing.\n\nDefense counsel in conspiracy prosecutions routinely make this argument to the\n\njury; they point to isolated acts, which are entirely innocent on their face – like\n\nmaking a telephone call, or walking across the street – and say that they establish\n\nnothing. The prosecutor, in responding, treats these innocent acts as dots and draws\n\n\n                                           59\n\flines between the dots. What emerges is the criminal conspiracy charged in the\n\nindictment. The majority opinion uses the former tactic here. For example,\n\nreferring to the Sheriff’s “custom and policy of releasing sick or injured inmates,”\n\nalleged as a fact in paragraph 54 of the complaint, the majority, isolates the fact and\n\nobserves: “We believe such a policy, on its face, violates no constitutional\n\nguarantees and is not a facially unconstitutional policy.” Ante at 34. I am at a loss\n\nto understand such treatment of this fact. Owens does not seek an order enjoining\n\nthis policy as unconstitutional. Rather, the allegation merely asserts why Hartley\n\nhad Owens sign his own bond. In addition to isolating facts revealed by the\n\ncomplaint, so to neutralize them, the majority, although paying lip service to the\n\nneed to consider the inferences these facts yield, says that “no inferences can be\n\nreasonably drawn to make up for the missing facts.” Ante at 36. I invite the\n\nmajority to say that the inferences I have drawn from the facts “well pled” in\n\nOwens’ complaint are not there.\n\n      The majority opinion, if implemented, will invite lawyers with cases like\n\nOwens’ – in which they have no access to the evidence that would explain why the\n\nSheriff and her deputies acted as they did – to allege facts in the blind. What about\n\nRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure? The majority opinion makes no\n\nmention of the rule, but it is surely implicated. Rule 11 states, in pertinent part:\n\n\n                                           60\n\f             (b) Representations to Court.

R. CIV. P. 11 (2001).\n\n      Let us suppose that, when this case returns to the district court, Owens’\n\ncounsel examines the Sheriff, Chief Deputy Hartley, the emergency room physician\n\n(who treated Owens), and the hospital’s administrator on deposition, and the\n\nfollowing is established:\n\n      1) The injuries Owens sustained during the assault were serious enough that\nhe needed close monitoring, because he might suffer a relapse.\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\f       2) After Owens arrived at the emergency room, at around 12:17 a.m., Hartley\ncalled the doctor on duty. The doctor told him that his injuries were serious and\nthat he need to be watched closely because his condition might worsen. The doctor\ntold Hartley that he should be hospitalized so his condition could be monitored;\nHartley responded that the monitoring could be done at the jail. Hartley said this\nbecause, after the ambulance transported Owens to the hospital, Hartley, knowing\nthat Owens had serious injuries, called the Sheriff. They discussed the possibility\nthat the emergency room doctor might want Owens admitted to the hospital proper,\nand that, if admitted, the Sheriff would have to pay the bill. The Sheriff did not\nwant to pay the bill; she was terribly short of funds – which explained why she had\nbeen unable to correct the multiple deficiencies the state corrections officials and\nothers had cited. So, the Sheriff instructed Hartley do what was necessary to keep\nOwens out of the hospital. He had to lie to the emergency room doctor, if\nnecessary.\n\n       3) Hartley lied to the doctor; he misrepresented that Owens would be\nmonitored at the jail in accordance with the hospital’s, and the doctors’, discharge\ninstructions.\n\n       4) At some point, Hartley and the Sheriff discussed Owens’ disposition after\nhe and Lowery retrieved him from the hospital. They recalled what had happened\nto Marsh after he returned to the jail; the four inmates who had assaulted him got\ninto his holding cell and blasted him with a fire extinguisher. The same four\ninmates were the ones who had assaulted Owens, and were still “at large,” and in\npossession of their weapons. If Owens were readmitted to the jail, they knew –\ngiven his condition – that he could not withstand another assault. The Sheriff’s and\nHartley’s discussion ended with the Sheriff’s instruction that Hartley get Owens out\nof the jail and take him to a motel on the edge of town. They overlooked the fact\nthat Owens was a pretrial detainee and, as such, could not be released except on\ncourt order.\n\n      If Count III had alleged these facts, I have no doubt that the majority would\n\nhold that the Sheriff is not entitled to qualified immunity. As I read the majority’s\n\nposition, the drafter of Count III should have alleged these facts or their equivalent.\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\fIn my view, the ethical constraints imposed on the litigation bar by Rule 11\n\nprecluded him from doing so. This is a quintessential Catch-22 situation, is it not?\n\n      Now, continuing the above supposition, after obtaining this evidence –\n\nwhich, with perhaps the exception of what the emergency room doctor might say –\n\nwas, and is, entirely in the possession of the Sheriff, her Chief Deputy, and their\n\nminions, Owens’ counsel moves the district court to amend Count III. The Sheriff,\n\nciting the law of the case doctrine, will object and her objection will probably be\n\nsustained. Or she will plead the statute of limitations. In either case, Owens, who\n\nhad no access to the evidence which would establish the facts the majority says he\n\nshould have pled, will go hence without day.\n\n      Respectfully, I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          63\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which\nTJOFLAT, MARCUS and WILSON, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n      I concur with the majority’s ultimate resolution of the claims against Sheriff\n\nHarris in her official capacity, the claims against Butler County, and Marsh and\n\nOwens’s deliberate indifference to serious risk of harm claims against the Sheriff in\n\nher individual capacity. I dissent, however, from the majority’s dismissal of\n\nOwens’s claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs against the\n\nSheriff in her individual capacity. I believe that the allegations in the complaint,\n\ntaken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Owens, are sufficient to\n\nwithstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state this claim. Moreover, I believe\n\nthat the law of deliberate indifference was sufficiently clear at the time of the\n\nincident that any reasonable government actor would have known that the alleged\n\nindiscriminate policy of releasing sick and injured inmates without guidelines that\n\nwould have prevented the officers from abandoning Owens in his condition at 3:00\n\na.m. on the side of the road was unconstitutionally applied to Owens.\n\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that the plaintiff’s complaint\n\ncontain only, “(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court’s\n\njurisdiction depends, . . .

This is especially\n\ntrue where, as here, the plaintiff’s injury is the result of the official’s own\n\nmalfeasance and the release is at a time and place where the plaintiff stood little\n\nchance of receiving a prescribed treatment. This is not to say that the release of an\n\ninmate with a serious medical need always violates the Constitution. A jailer is not\n\nconstitutionally required to provide for the continued medical care of a released\n\ninmate. The Constitution does require, however, that the release itself not be an act\n\nof deliberate indifference – i.e. that the release, or manner of release, is not an\n\nunreasonable response to a known medical need. Therefore, where, as here, the\n\n\n                                            66\n\fserious medical need is known by the officials, is created by the official’s conduct,\n\nand the inmate is released in an unreasonable manner where he has little or no\n\nchance of obtaining his prescribed treatment, there is the deprivation of a\n\nconstitutional right.\n\n      Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, it cannot be gainsaid that the\n\ncondition Owens alleged he was in when he was released by the hospital constituted\n\na “serious medical need” and that the officers who took him from the hospital knew\n\nof his need. Owens’s head, neck and face were severely swollen and bruised, his lip\n\nhad a hole torn through it, his ribs and chest were bruised and had been diagnosed\n\nas requiring continuing care and monitoring for his head injuries.

The majority holds that\n\nOwens has not satisfied this requirement because he has not alleged that the Sheriff\n\nis “causally linked” to his constitutional deprivation. See, e.g., Rizzo v. Goode, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109349\"><a href=\"/opinion/109349/rizzo-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). Viewing the allegations in the complaint in the light most\n\nfavorable to Owens, however, I believe that the complaint is sufficient to withstand\n\nthe Sheriff’s motion to dismiss.\n\n      As our case law recognizes, there are several ways Owens can establish the\n\nrequired causal link. Although § 1983 requires a connection between the official’s\n\nacts or omissions and the plaintiff’s injury, “[p]ersonal participation is only one of\n\nseveral ways to establish the requisite causal connection. . . . An official may also\n\nbe liable where a policy or custom that [she] established or utilized results in\n\ndeliberate indifference to an inmate’s constitutional rights.” Zatler v.

Owens also alleged that the Sheriff was responsible for\n\nthe development and implementation of any policy at the Jail pertaining to\n\ntreatment of sick and injured inmates. The complaint further alleged that the Sheriff\n\nreceived a call from the Jail during the assault on Owens. Rather than crediting\n\nthese allegations and viewing them in the light most favorable to Owens, the\n\nmajority refuses to infer any content into the phone conversation and simply refuses\n\nto accept the allegation of the Sheriff’s obligations regarding the development and\n\nimplementation of a reasonable medical policy.\n\n      As to the phone call, the majority states, “Nothing alleges that the Sheriff was\n\naware of who was being assaulted, the severity of the assault, or that an inmate\n\nwould have to go to the hospital.” Majority at *31 n. 15. However viewing the\n\nallegations regarding the phone call in the light most favorable to Owens, the phone\n\nconversation contained all of the relevant information. Although the Sheriff may\n\nnot have known Owens’s name, the reasonable inference drawn from a phone call\n\nmade during a serious assault at the jail in which inmates were screaming “They’re\n\n\n                                         69\n\fkilling him up here,” to the Sheriff’s home, in the middle of the night, by the only\n\ndeputy on duty at the Jail, after the local police had refused to help break up the\n\nassault, is that the call was made to inform the Sheriff of the situation and to ask for\n\nher advice and help. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the Sheriff was fully\n\ninformed of the assault on Owens when she refused to come to the Jail, and it does\n\nnot “appear beyond doubt” that Owens would be unable to prove these facts given\n\nthe opportunity to conduct discovery.\n\n      Further, the majority’s refusal to credit Owens’s allegation regarding the\n\ndevelopment and implementation of the policy in effect at the Jail flies in the face\n\nof the bedrock jurisprudential principle that when ruling on a motion to dismiss the\n\nplaintiff’s allegations must be taken as true.

The majority rejects Owens’s allegation regarding the existence\n\nof a policy stating that unsupported conclusions of law will not prevent a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) dismissal. The existence and content of a policy, or the lack thereof,\n\nhowever, is a factual, not a legal, allegation. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held\n\nthat in reviewing a complaint alleging the existence of a custom or policy, the\n\nplaintiff’s allegations are to be taken as true and no particularized allegations are\n\n\n\n\n                                           70\n\frequired to survive a motion to dismiss.1 See Leatherman v.

I agree with the majority that the\n\npolicy is facially constitutional because it could be humanely applied. However,\n\ncontrary to the majority, I believe that, in light of the circumstances that existed at\n\nthe Jail, the policy posed an obvious danger to inmates such that an allegation\n\n\n\n   1\n     Under Supreme Court precedent and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court ruling on\na motion to dismiss is required to accept a plaintiff’s allegations as true and construe those\nallegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. In failing to do so here, the majority\nconflates the degree of specificity required of a complaint to adequately allege a substantive fact\nand the actual substantive facts which must be alleged to state a claim. To the extent that the\nmajority suggests a different standard for pleading in anticipation of the affirmative defense of\nqualified immunity, the Supreme Court has held that “questions regarding pleading . . . are most\nfrequently and most effectively resolved either by the rulemaking process or the legislative\nprocess.” Crawford-El v. Britton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 595 (1998) (rejecting attempt to impose\nheightened standard of proof on civil rights claims as unsupported by § 1983 and the Federal\nRules and straying “far from the traditional limits on judicial authority”). Here, although the\nmajority implies that the policy concerns behind qualified immunity justify requiring more\nparticular allegations from Owens’s complaint, “ that is a result which must be obtained by the\nprocess of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.” Leatherman, 507\nU.S. at 168 (“it is impossible to square . . . [a] heightened pleading standard . . . with the liberal\nsystem of ‘notice pleading’ set up by the Federal Rules”). Indeed, when Congress has wished to\nimpose a heightened pleading standard, it has not hesitated to do so, either in the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(a) (imposing heightened pleading standard for\nallegations of fraud and mistake), or by statute, see 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4 et seq. (imposing\nheightened pleading standard for claims under federal securities laws).\n\n\n                                                  71\n\fregarding the existence of the policy leads to the reasonable inference that the\n\nSheriff was aware that the policy posed an excessive risk of harm. Here, the Sheriff\n\nran a jail that was in such poor condition, so understaffed, and so poorly managed\n\nthat the facility itself posed an excessive risk of harm to inmates of which the\n\nSheriff was aware. In such a circumstance, it is inevitable that inmates will be\n\nseriously injured, as Owens was here. A policy of releasing sick and injured\n\ninmates – regardless of the degree of injury – clearly poses an excessive risk of\n\nharm to those inmates and it is reasonable to infer that the Sheriff knew of this risk.\n\nI believe that these facts are sufficient to support a finding of deliberate\n\nindifference.\n\n      I also believe that the law was sufficiently clear at the time of the challenged\n\naction that qualified immunity does not bar civil liability for this claim. Under the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity, government officials sued for damages for injuries\n\narising out the performance of their discretionary functions must be “shown to have\n\nviolated ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\n\nperson would have known.’” Conn v.
