INTRODUCTION\n        The City and County of San Francisco (City) prevailed in this California\nEnvironmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)1 writ\nproceeding brought by the Coalition for Adequate Review and Alliance for\nComprehensive Planning (collectively, petitioners). After securing judgment, the City\nfiled a memorandum of costs totaling $64,144, largely for costs incurred in preparing a\nsupplemental record of the proceedings. Petitioners filed a motion to tax. The trial court\ngranted the motion and denied all costs. The court’s reasoning was two-fold: First, it\nrelied on the fact petitioners had elected to prepare the record, themselves, as allowed by\nCEQA’s record preparation statute (§ 21167.6, subd. (b)(2)). Second, it feared sizeable\ncost awards would have a chilling effect on lawsuits challenging important public\nprojects. Neither rationale is a legally permissible basis for denying record preparation\ncosts to the City. We therefore reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n        1\n        All further statutory references are to the Public Resources Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                             1\n\f                     II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In our prior opinion affirming the denial of petitioners’ writ petition on the merits\n(Coalition for Adequate Review v. City and County of San Francisco (June 25, 2013,\nA131487) [nonpub. opn.]), we discussed at length the land use plans, rezoning, and\nprojects around Octavia and Market streets at issue in this case. We need set forth here\nonly the facts relevant to the City’s appeal from the order granting petitioners’ motion to\ntax costs.\nInitial Record Preparation\n       Petitioners chose to prepare the record of proceedings, themselves, as permitted by\nCEQA’s record preparation statute, specifically, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). The\nCity maintains it thereupon made available some 26,000 pages of material to facilitate\npetitioners’ preparation of the record. Petitioners contend the City, in fact, obstructed and\ndelayed access to these documents and made the process of copying unduly cumbersome\nand expensive. Petitioners also contend that at 4 p.m. the day before they were, by\nagreement, to present the record to the City for its review and certification, the City\nsuddenly notified them of an additional 3,000 pages of material and a CD of unknown\nvolume, and claimed it was going to prepare a supplemental record containing these\nitems. The City did not produce this material to petitioners until a few weeks later.\nNevertheless, on August 28, 2008, the agreed-upon date, petitioners presented the City\nwith a 30-volume record, totaling 8,306 pages in length.\n       Two weeks later, on September 12, 2008, the City certified the record petitioners\nhad prepared, but only in part, stating it was incomplete. It appeared to the City that\npetitioners had omitted documents statutorily required to be in the record under\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (e), and which the City had, at least at some point, made\navailable to petitioners. The City therefore notified petitioners it reserved the right to\nseek inclusion of any of the additional 21,000-plus pages of material it had produced to\npetitioners which were not already in the record.\n       The City then made several attempts to add materials to the record—both through\nex parte applications and by negotiations with petitioners. During negotiations, the City\n\n\n                                              2\n\fproposed augmenting the record when it filed its opposition to the writ petition in order to\navoid including unnecessary materials.\n       As part of a November 19, 2008, case management statement, the City attached an\nindex of its proposed additions to the record, totaling 4,809 pages in 12 volumes. A\nmonth later, on December 12, 2008, the City formally moved to supplement the record of\nthe proceedings with these 12 volumes.\n       Petitioners opposed the motion. They argued they were in control of the record,\nand the City had no right to make additions. They also asserted the City sought to add\nirrelevant and duplicative materials, and the proposed supplement was a ploy to raise\ncosts. Petitioners denied having excluded from the record any materials that supported\nthe City’s approval of the project.\n       The City disputed petitioners’ contentions about the proposed supplemental\nrecord, except for 10 documents which it acknowledged were duplicates or near\nduplicates of materials already in the record prepared by petitioners. The City also\nmaintained it timely produced most of the required documents, except for certain studies\ncited in the EIR, which it made available to petitioners after learning of the omission.\n       On May 12, 2009, the trial court (Judge Feinstein) granted the City’s motion to\nsupplement the record, finding petitioners had omitted materials statutorily required to be\nin the record under section 21167.6, subdivision (e). It disallowed, however, the 10\nconcededly duplicative documents (approximately 250 pages of the 4,809-page proposed\nsupplement). The court also expressly rejected petitioners’ assertion that the City’s\nefforts to supplement the record violated its statutory duty to control record preparation\ncosts, set forth in section 21167.7, subdivision (f). The court noted in this regard\npetitioners had rejected the City’s proposal to file a supplemental record when it filed its\nopposition to the writ petition and, instead, had insisted the record be fixed before\nbriefing on the merits. The court also ruled “[w]ithout prejudice to the City’s ability to\nseek cost recovery at the conclusion of this litigation, as appropriate, Petitioners shall pay\nto the City the reproduction costs associated with Petitioners’ copy and the court’s copy\nof the City’s Supplement.” Petitioners moved for rehearing, arguing the immediate order\n\n\n                                              3\n\fto pay for reproduction costs was improper. In August 2009, the court denied rehearing,\nconcluding the issue of interim reproduction costs had been briefed and properly\ndetermined.2\nDocument Requests\n       In addition to the supplemental record dispute, the parties also sparred over\nwhether certain document requests petitioners made at the outset of the litigation were\noverbroad and burdensome. Petitioners, for instance, requested production of “[a]ll files\nrelating to all projects, including all proposed developments, public works and building\nprojects and building permits of any kind that are either within the pipeline or not within\nthe pipeline but within the Market-Octavia project area . . . .” (Emphasis omitted.) The\nCity viewed these requests as creating busywork unrelated to the writ petition.\nPetitioners viewed them as essential to their writ petition, and even without regard to the\npending litigation, legitimate under the State’s Public Record Act (Gov. Code, § 6250 et\nseq.) and City’s Sunshine Ordinance.\nMerits Hearing and Cost Proceedings\n       Ultimately, the trial court (Judge Sullivan) denied the petition for writ of mandate\non the merits. In so doing, the court adopted a lengthy proposed statement of decision\nprepared by the City. The statement largely cited to the record prepared by petitioners,\nbut made a few citations to the supplemental record.\n       The City then filed a memorandum of costs, seeking $64,144 for “administrative\nrecord, professional messenger, and service.” This included $3,231.62 for production\n(copying, binding, and page numbering) of the supplemental record; $383.32 for\nproduction (copying and binding) of a four-volume “excerpts of record;” $804.34 the\npetitioners had charged the City for a copy of the record they prepared; $50,191.50 for\nparalegal time; $8,053.14 for City Planning Department time; and $1,480.36 for\nprofessional couriers.\n\n       2\n          The City therefore made a demand for $1,764.80 in copying costs. Whether this\nwas paid at the time, or whether it was included in the record preparation costs the City\nlater claimed in its memorandum of costs, is unclear.\n\n                                             4\n\f       Petitioners moved to tax costs. They maintained section 21167.6, subdivision\n(b)(2)—pursuant to which petitioners had prepared the record—precluded the recovery of\nany record preparation costs by the City. They also specifically objected to the City’s\nclaimed costs related to the excerpts of record, paralegal and staff costs, and courier fees,\nand additionally claimed that, even if allowable, all the costs were unnecessary and\nunreasonable. In the latter regard, petitioners maintained the supplemental record played\nno meaningful role in the resolution of the writ petition. The City opposed the motion on\nall grounds.\n       Following a hearing, the trial court (Judge Sullivan) issued an order granting the\nmotion to tax and denying all costs. The court concluded petitioners were “not liable” for\ncosts “under . . . section 21167.6(b)(2),” reasoning the City, not petitioners, sought to\nsupplement the record and therefore the City should bear the cost of supplementation.\nAncillary to this conclusion, the court concluded petitioners’ discovery requests were not\n“extraordinary” and not the “but for” cause of the City’s claimed costs. The court further\nconcluded a cost award as large as the City sought would “certainly chill any desire by\nmembers of the general public to seek court review of important civic undertakings,”\nobserving petitioners had made neither a frivolous nor bad faith challenge to an\n“important” project. The City timely appealed.\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review\n       The standard of review applicable to a cost order depends on the issue raised on\nappeal. When the question is whether a claimed cost comes within the general cost\nstatutes and is recoverable at all, the question is one of statutory interpretation, subject to\nde novo review. (Baker-Hoey v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 592,\n597 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 593].) Similarly, the interpretation of CEQA’s record preparation\nprovisions set forth in Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivisions (a)–(f),\npresents a question of law subject to de novo review. (Hayward Area Planning Assn. v.\nCity of Hayward (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 176, 182 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 783] (Hayward Area\nPlanning).) Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation, however,\n\n\n                                               5\n\f“ ‘ “presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion.” ’ ” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 71\n[100 Cal.Rptr.3d 152] (Gorman), quoting Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)\n19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 810].) Similarly, “ ‘[w]hether a particular cost\nto prepare an administrative record was necessary and reasonable is an issue for the\nsound discretion of the trial court.’ ” (California Oak Foundation v. Regents of the\nUniversity of California (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 227, 293–294 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 631]\n(California Oak Foundation), quoting River Valley Preservation Project v. Metropolitan\nTransit Development Bd. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 154, 181 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 501] (River\nValley).)\nB. CEQA’s Record Preparation Statute (§ 21167.6)\n       Public Resources Code section 21167.6 is one of several statutes spelling out the\nprocedures for challenging a CEQA determination. (See Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21167\net seq.) The statute applies to any CEQA challenge, whether brought as a traditional\nmandamus proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (Pub. Resources\nCode, § 21168.5) or as an administrative mandamus proceeding under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1094.5 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168). It addresses both the\npreparation of the “record of proceedings” upon the commencement of an action (Pub.\nResources Code, § 21167.6, subds. (a)–(f)) and the preparation of the “clerk’s transcript\non appeal” if an appeal is taken from the judgment in such an action (id., subd. (g)). (See\nMadera Oversight Coalition, Inc. v. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 61,\nfn. 4 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 626] (Madera Oversight Coalition) [“[c]are must be taken to\ndistinguish the administrative record (i.e., the ‘record of proceedings’) from the record on\nappeal”], disapproved on other grounds by Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro\nLine Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 457 [160 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 304 P.3d\n499].) We are concerned here with the preparation of the record of proceedings.3\n\n       3\n         The “record of proceedings” is often referred to as the “administrative record,”\nregardless of whether the challenge is brought as a traditional or administrative\nmandamus action. (Madera Oversight Coalition, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 61, fn. 4.)\n\n                                              6\n\f       Section 21167.6 provides flexibility as to how the record of proceedings is\nprepared. The traditional procedure is set forth in subdivision (a), which provides in\npertinent part: “At the time the action or proceeding is filed, the plaintiff or petitioner\nshall file a request that the respondent public agency prepare the record of proceedings\n. . . . The request, together with the complaint or petition, shall be served personally upon\nthe public agency not later than 10 business days from the date that the action or\nproceeding was filed.” (§ 21167.6, subd. (a).) The statute also provides for other record\npreparation options to help reduce record preparation costs. Subdivision (b)(2), thus,\nprovides: “The plaintiff or petitioner may elect to prepare the record of proceedings or\nthe parties may agree to an alternative method of preparation of the record of\nproceedings, subject to certification of its accuracy by the public agency, within the time\nlimit specified in this subdivision.” (§ 21167.6, subd. (b)(2); see generally St. Vincent’s\nSchool for Boys, Catholic Charities CYO v. City of San Rafael (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th\n989, 1013–1014 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 213] (St. Vincent’s School).)\n       Additional specifics with respect to the handling of the record are set forth in\nsubdivision (b)(1). It provides: “The public agency shall prepare and certify the record\nof proceedings not later than 60 days from the date that the request specified in\nsubdivision (a) was served upon the public agency. Upon certification, the public agency\nshall lodge a copy of the record of proceedings with the court and shall serve on the\nparties notice that the record of proceedings has been certified and lodged with the court.\nThe parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the\nrecord of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court . . . .” (§ 21167.6,\nsubd. (b)(1).) Subdivision (c), in turn, provides the 60-day period for certification may be\nextended by stipulation of the parties or by court order. (Id., subd. (c).)\n       Thus, CEQA’s record preparation cost provision, in particular, appears at the end\nof the subdivision that begins by spelling out an agency’s 60-day certification obligation\nupon being served with a request to prepare the record (§ 21167.6, subd. (a)) or upon\nbeing provided with a record prepared by the petitioner or party or by some other, agreed-\nto means (id., subd. (b)(2)). The cost provision, by its plain terms, places the costs an\n\n\n                                              7\n\fagency incurs in preparing the record on the parties, not the public agency. (Ibid.; see\nBlack Historical Society v. City of San Diego (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 670, 677–678\n[36 Cal.Rptr.3d 378] (Black Historical Society).) The rationale for doing so is that\n“ ‘taxpayers . . . should not have to bear the cost of preparing the administrative record in\na lawsuit brought by a private individual or entity.’ ”4 (Black Historical Society, supra,\n134 Cal.App.4th at p. 677, quoting River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.)\n       Accordingly, a petitioner can be ordered to pay for a requested record during the\nearly stages of the litigation, before the merits of the case are ever heard. (See, e.g., San\nDiego Citizenry Group v. County of San Diego (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1, 10\n[161 Cal.Rptr.3d 447] (San Diego Citizenry) [prior to merits hearing, the county “moved\nfor an order determining and directing payment of” record preparation costs; court issued\nsingle ruling both denying relief on the merits and ordering reimbursement of record\npreparation costs]; Black Historical Society, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 673, 677–678\n[when petitioner failed to pay agency’s record preparation costs after agency’s request\nthat it do so, followed by a court order that it do so, trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin dismissing case for lack of prosecution].) Indeed, a public agency can refuse to release\na record it has been asked to prepare until the petitioner making the request has paid the\nagency’s preparation costs. (Black Historical Society, at pp. 674, 677–678.)\n       This does not mean a public agency can charge a petitioner or party whatever it\nwants for preparing the record. Section 21167.6, subdivision (f), mandates the “party\npreparing the record shall strive to do so at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the\nrecord.” (§ 21167.6, subd. (f); see generally St. Vincent’s School, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1014–1019 [discussing the “cost-containment policy embodied in\n\n       4\n          In fact, in one of the earliest cases discussing an agency’s recoupment of record\npreparation costs under section 21167.6, the Court of Appeal affirmed the agency’s\nrecovery of such costs and the denial of the petitioner’s motion to tax, even though the\nappellate court reversed the decision on the merits that had been in favor of the agency.\nThe trial court had not, however, examined the reasonableness of the agency’s claimed\ncosts and was directed to do so on remand. (Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mount\nShasta (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, 447–448 [243 Cal.Rptr. 727] (Citizens for Quality\nGrowth).)\n\n                                               8\n\fsection 21167.6”].) A petitioner can also, by interim motion, challenge an agency’s\nrecord preparation charge as excessive or unreasonable. (See, e.g., River Valley, supra,\n37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 164, 180–182 [during initial stages of the litigation, petitioner filed\n“motion to determine the costs of preparing the administrative record”].) Similarly, a\npetitioner can, by interim motion, challenge a record prepared by a public agency as\nbeing incomplete or as including documents not properly part of the record. (See, e.g.,\nCitizens for Ceres v. Superior Court (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 889, 900–901 [during early\nstages of litigation, petitioner filed objection to certified record claiming city’s exclusion\nof documents on attorney-client and work product grounds was erroneous; appellate court\ngranted interlocutory writ review of trial court’s interim order and granted writ relief in\npart]; Madera Oversight Coalition, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at pp. 63–66 [case\nmanagement order specified record disputes were to be raised no later than merits\nbriefing; petitioners then filed multiple requests that certified record be augmented, which\ntrial court ruled on at same time it ruled on merits].)\n        With this overview of CEQA’s record preparation statute, we turn to the principal\nissue on appeal—whether petitioners’ election to prepare the record, themselves, under\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), precludes an award of record preparation costs to the\nCity.\nC. A Petitioner’s Election to Prepare the Record Does Not Preclude a Public Agency\nFrom Recovering Supplemental Record Preparation Costs When Incurred to Ensure a\nStatutorily Complete Record\n       Petitioners maintain the whole point of CEQA’s alternative record preparation\nprovisions is to avoid agency preparation costs, and, therefore, their election to prepare\nthe record under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), precludes any award of such costs to\nthe City. The trial court appears to have taken a more nuanced approach and concluded a\npetitioner’s election under subdivision (b)(2) precludes an agency from recovering record\npreparation costs except in “extraordinary” circumstances like those in St. Vincent’s\nSchool.\n        In St. Vincent’s School, the plaintiff also chose to prepare the record. (St.\nVincent’s School, supra, 161Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) To enable it to do so, the city was\n\n                                               9\n\frequired to locate 2,208 documents, totaling more than 58,000 pages, which ultimately\ntook up more than 20 boxes. (Id. at p. 1017.) Noting few e-mails were included, the\nplaintiff filed a Public Records Act (Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.) request asking the city for\n“all writings evidencing or reflecting communications, stored on [any city] computer hard\ndrive or server” relating to the property in question. (St. Vincent’s School, at p. 1017.)\nThis required the city to review nine more boxes of materials. (Ibid.) After the city\nprovided copies of all responsive, nonprivileged documents, the petitioner made yet\nanother demand to inspect documents. (Id. at pp. 1017–1018.) Before this last set of\ndemands was resolved, the plaintiff filed its merits brief in support of its writ petition.\n(Id. at p. 1018.) After the city prevailed on the merits, it sought and was awarded\n$26,362.50 in costs incurred in searching its computer files. (Id. at p. 1013.)\n       The Court of Appeal affirmed. It first addressed and rejected the same argument\nthe plaintiffs make here—that because the plaintiff chose to prepare the record under\nsubdivision (b)(2), the city was foreclosed from recovering any record preparation costs.\n(St. Vincent’s School, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1014–1019.) The court pointed out\nthe city was not seeking to recover “the entire cost for preparation.” (Id. at p. 1014.) It\nfurther concluded disallowing the city’s costs would undermine the cost-containment\npolicies embodied in section 21167.6, subdivision (f), and reward the petitioner for\nabusive document demands. (St. Vincent’s School, at pp. 1018–1019.) “St. Vincent’s\nactions, which caused the City to expend considerable time and resources in responding\nto its discovery demands, reflect a complete abandonment of its statutory responsibility to\n‘strive to [prepare the record] at reasonable cost.’ ” (Id. at p. 1019.) The appellate court\nthus concluded “section 21167.6 does not preclude an award of costs in favor of the\nCity.” (Ibid.) It also concluded the trial court had not abused its discretion as to the\namount awarded. (Ibid.)\n       We agree with St. Vincent’s School that the fact a petitioner elects to prepare the\nrecord under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), does not ipso facto bar the recovery of\nrecord preparation costs by a public agency. Subdivision (b)(2) contains no such\nprohibition. Moreover, that subdivision expressly refers to and incorporates the 60-day\n\n\n                                              10\n\fperiod for record certification set forth in the first sentence of subdivision (b)(1).\n(§ 21167.6, subd. (b)(2).) Thus, the two subdivisions are inter-related. The record\npreparation cost provision—specifying the parties, not the public agency, are to pay for\nthe record—is, as we have discussed, set forth in the third and final sentence of\nsubdivision (b)(1) and, significantly, does not refer to any particular means by which the\nrecord is prepared. (Id., subd. (b)(1).) Finally, as St. Vincent’s School recognized, the\nfact a petitioner makes an election to proceed under subdivision (b)(2), does not mean the\nagency will never, under any circumstances, incur record preparation costs.\n       The trial court appears to have read St. Vincent’s School as identifying the only\ncircumstance in which an agency can recoup record preparation costs where the petitioner\nhas chosen to prepare the record under subdivision (b)(2), i.e., where the petitioner has\nmade “extraordinary” production demands purportedly in connection with its preparation\nof the record. The appellate court did not suggest, however, it was doing anything other\nthan addressing the particular circumstances before it. We therefore do not read St.\nVincent’s School as drawing the bounds of an agency’s recovery of record preparation\ncosts where the petitioner has opted to prepare the record under subdivision (b)(2).\n       There is no question the alternative record preparation procedures authorized by\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), are intended to reduce record preparation costs. (See\ngenerally Hayward Area Planning, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 183–184 [discussing\ncost control provisions of § 21167.6].)\n       But just as a record prepared by an agency at the request of a petitioner under\nsubdivision (a) must be complete, so, too, must a record prepared by alternative means\nunder subdivision (b)(2). (See § 21167.6, subd. (e); see Madera Oversight Coalition,\nsupra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 62 [“[r]egardless of which [record preparation] method is\nchosen, the administrative record is ‘subject to certification of its accuracy by the public\nagency’ ” quoting § 21167.6, subd. (b)(2)].) When a record prepared under\nsubdivision (b)(2) is incomplete, and an agency is put to the task of supplementation to\nensure completeness, the language of the statute allows, and the purpose of the record\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fpreparation cost provision to protect public monies counsels, that the agency recoup the\ncosts of preparing the supplemental record.\n       CEQA is clear about what the record must contain—it “shall include,” at a\nminimum, the documents enumerated in section 21167.6, subdivision (e). (See San\nDiego Citizenry, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 26–27 [subdivision (e) specifies the\nmaterials “required” to be in the record].) This “language is mandatory—all items\ndescribed in any of the enumerated categories shall be included in the administrative\nrecord.” (Madera, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 63; see also Eureka Citizens for\nResponsible Government v. City of Eureka (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 357, 366\n[54 Cal.Rptr.3d 485] [“content of administrative records in CEQA proceedings is\ngoverned by . . . section 21167.6, subdivision (e)”].)\n       We see no reason why parties cannot agree to a smaller (and thus less expensive)\nrecord if it will provide the court with all the materials relevant to the issue(s) raised by\nthe petitioner. (See § 21167.6, subds. (b)(2) [“the parties may agree to an alternative\nmethod of preparation of the record of proceedings”], (f) [“party preparing the record\nshall strive to do so at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the record”]; 2 Kostka &\nZischke, Practice Under the Cal. Environmental Quality Act (Cont.Ed.Bar 2014) § 23.73,\np. 23-86 [“parties should consider stipulating to exclude extraneous documents from the\nrecord”].)\n       However, where no such agreement is reached, a public agency is not required to\nput itself at risk of a statutorily incomplete record. (See County of Orange v. Superior\nCourt (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1, 13 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 286] [“when it comes to the\nadministrative record in a CEQA case, any reduction in its contents is presumptively\nprejudicial to project proponents,” as it is they “who will be saddled with the task of\npointing to things in the record to refute asserted inadequacies in the EIR”], italics\nomitted; Protect Our Water v. County of Merced (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 362, 373\n[1 Cal.Rptr.3d 726] [“The consequences of providing a record to the courts that does not\nevidence the agency’s compliance with CEQA is severe—reversal of project approval.”];\nMadera, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 75; Friends of Lagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville\n\n\n                                              12\n\f(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 834 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 251] [“Because it risked reversal of the\nProject’s approval if the record lacked supporting evidence, Triad properly took pains to\nensure the court was provided with a complete record of all relevant proceedings.”].)\n       Here, the City offered to defer supplementation of the record until it filed its\nopposition to the writ petition, since only then would it know with certainty what\nadditional materials, if any, were pertinent to its defense of the project approval.\nPetitioners, however, rejected this suggestion and, instead, insisted the record be fixed\nbefore they filed their opening merits brief.\n       Moreover, the City did not unilaterally prepare a supplemental record. Rather, it\nfiled a motion for leave to do so, identifying the documents it intended to include.\nPetitioners filed opposition, making some of the same arguments they have made in\nopposition to the City’s claimed record preparation costs. The trial court granted the\nCity’s motion, but not entirely, excluding from the supplemental record documents that\nessentially duplicated documents already included in the record petitioners had prepared.\nAs to the documents the trial court allowed, it expressly found they were statutorily\nrequired to be in the record under section 21167.6, subdivision (e). The court also\nexpressly found the City’s preparation of a supplemental record to include these\ndocuments did not violate the City’s obligation under subdivision (f) to minimize record\npreparation costs. In our prior opinion we affirmed the court’s supplementation order,\nincluding on the ground petitioners failed to carry their burden on appeal to demonstrate\nerror. (Coalition for Adequate Review v. City and County of San Francisco, supra,\nA131487.)\n       Under these circumstances, we have no trouble concluding the City was\neffectively put to the task of preparing a statutorily complete record and, therefore, may\nrecover its reasonable costs of preparing the supplemental record.5\n\n\n       5\n         At oral argument, petitioners argued that, in light of their election to prepare the\nrecord under subdivision (b)(2), the City improperly moved to prepare a supplemental\nrecord and, instead, should have moved for an order directing petitioners to prepare the\ndesired supplement. Petitioners never made this assertion in the trial court. While they\n\n                                                13\n\f       The trial court also denied record preparation costs on the ground a sizeable cost\naward “would certainly chill any desire by members of the general public to seek court\nreview of important civic undertakings.” The court’s “chill” analysis would pertain to\nany CEQA challenge, whether brought as a traditional or administrative mandamus case,\nsince both are employed to challenge “important” civic projects. Yet, Public Resources\nCode section 21168, by referencing Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, expressly\nprovides for the prevailing party in a CEQA administrative mandamus proceeding to\nrecover the costs of record preparation. (See Wagner Farms, Inc. v. Modesto Irrigation\nDist. (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 765, 772–773 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 683] (Wagner Farms)\n[discussing fact Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, pertaining to administrative\nmandamus, expressly provides for the prevailing party to recover record preparation\ncosts, but section 1085, pertaining to ordinary mandamus, does not].) Thus, CEQA,\nitself, refutes a general “chill” rationale to deny record preparation costs to a public\nagency. (See also San Diego Citizenry, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at p. 11 [affirming\nagency’s request for record preparation costs and quoting trial court’s observation that\n“ ‘[g]roups like petitioner are free to exercise their petition rights, but as has been often\nsaid in other contexts, freedom is not free’ ”].) Furthermore, as we have discussed,\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (b)(1), expressly provides that the parties, not the public\nagency, are to pay record preparation costs. This statutory obligation implements a\n\nopposed the City’s motion to file a supplemental record on numerous grounds, they never\nargued the City was asking for inappropriate relief and never claimed, if the trial court\nwas inclined to allow a supplemental record, they should be the ones to prepare it. Nor\ndo either of the cases petitioners cited at oral argument—Madera Oversight Coalition,\nsupra, 199 Cal.App.4th 48, and Leavitt v. County of Madera (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th\n1502 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 101] (Leavitt)—suggest the City should have sought an order\ndirecting petitioners to prepare the supplemental record. As we have discussed, Madera\nOversight Coalition generally discusses the trial court’s power to resolve record disputes.\n(Madera Oversight Coalition, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at pp. 63–64.) Leavitt recognizes a\ntrial court can impose terminating sanctions when a petitioner undertakes but fails to\ncomplete the record preparation process, but only if “given an opportunity to comply.”\n(Leavitt, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at p. 1526.) Neither case even suggests a public agency\ncannot, itself, take action to ensure a statutorily complete record where, as here, the\npetitioner disputes the agency’s assessment that the record is incomplete.\n\n\n                                              14\n\fdifferent, but equally important policy—that public monies should not be used to fund\nCEQA challenges brought by private parties. (See Black Historical Society, supra,\n134 Cal.App.4th at p. 677; River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.) This policy is\nall the more compelling where, as here, a private party loses its CEQA challenge on the\nmerits.\n          We thus conclude the trial court erred in its interpretation of CEQA’s record\npreparation statute and reverse that portion of the order denying supplemental record\npreparation costs to the City, and remand for further proceedings.\nD. Specific Cost Items\n          In addition to insisting their election to prepare the record under section 21167.6,\nsubdivision (b)(2), constituted a bar to the City’s recovery of supplemental record\npreparation costs, petitioners also challenged the reasonableness of the City’s claimed\ncosts. Because the trial court denied costs entirely, it did not consider the reasonableness\nof the City’s claimed costs. On remand, it must exercise its discretion in this regard.\n(See Wagner Farms, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at pp. 772–773; Citizens for Quality\nGrowth, supra, 198 Cal.App.3d at p. 448.) To provide further guidance on remand, we\nturn to specific cost items sought by the City.6\n          Paralegal Costs Related to Supplemental Record\n          In addition to the costs of copying, binding, and page numbering the supplemental\nrecord, the City seeks approximately $50,000 for over 300 hours of paralegal time (at a\nrate of between $159 to $165 per hour) in connection with preparing the supplemental\nrecord. The City submitted billing records showing time spent reviewing the record\nprepared by petitioners for certification, reviewing other materials for inclusion in a\nsupplemental record, organizing those documents, preparing an index, working with\nvendors on the supplemental record, and meeting with attorneys.\n          6\n          Petitioners may not, on remand, challenge the reasonableness of the contents of\nthe supplemental record and contend any of the documents need not have been included.\nAs we have discussed, the trial court long ago determined the materials included in the\nsupplemental record were statutorily required under section 21167.6, subdivision (e), and\nthat determination has been affirmed on appeal.\n\n\n                                                15\n\f       The City may claim reimbursement for reasonable labor costs required to prepare\nthe supplemental record. (See California Oak Foundation, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 293–295 [affirming $46,563 in costs for “labor in compiling the record,” including\nparalegal time; university personnel “retrieved, reviewed, organized, and indexed over\n40,000 pages of documents”]; River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 181–182\n[affirming costs for time spent by assistant transportation engineer and paralegal\nreviewing and compiling documents].)\n       However, we have been cited no authority, nor are we aware of any, indicating\nlabor costs to review a petitioner-prepared record of proceedings “for completeness” in\nconnection with certification pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(1), are\nrecoverable record preparation costs. This sort of review is a chore public agencies face\nin every case in which the petitioner elects to prepare the record under subdivision (b)(2),\nand if an agency could always claim a sizeable amount for review “for completeness” or\n“certification,” that would defeat the Legislature’s aim of providing for lower-cost record\npreparation alternatives. (§ 21167.6, subds. (b)(2), (f); cf. Hayward Area Planning,\nsupra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 183–186 [denying city’s claimed record preparation costs\nbecause delegating preparation to real party in interest “undermined the statutory scheme\nfor controlling the costs of record preparation”].) Additionally, record review “for\ncompleteness” can easily blur into review for strategy, implicating the kind of attorney\nfee award neither authorized nor sought here. (See Wagner Farms, supra,\n145 Cal.App.4th at p. 779 [drawing distinction between time agency employees spent\nthat was “necessary for preparation” of record and time “that went beyond that merely\nrelated to prepar[ation],” such as preparing the agency’s own case].)\n       Because the trial court denied record preparation costs entirely, it did not review\nthe City’s claimed paralegal costs to determine which of these costs were for work\nreasonably required to prepare the supplemental record (e.g., locating, copying, indexing,\nand assembling documents) and are recoverable, and which were for review of the record\npetitioners prepared “for completeness” and are not recoverable. On remand, the trial\ncourt will need to make this determination. (See Wagner, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at\n\n\n                                             16\n\fp. 779 [where claimed labor costs could not be segregated between time attributable to\npreparing record and other tasks, matter was remanded for further proceedings].)\n       Costs to Retrieve Documents to Prepare Record\n       The City also seeks approximately $392 for messenger costs for transporting\nrecord materials between the City’s planning department and City Hall. To the extent\nthese retrieval costs were incurred, as the City asserts, in compiling the supplemental\nrecord, we discern no material difference between these costs and other labor costs of\nassembling the record, and they are recoverable. (See California Oak Foundation,\nsupra,188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 294–295 [affirming costs for retrieving documents “located\nin many departments throughout the campus”].) But because the trial court denied costs\nentirely, it also did not review the reasonableness of the City’s claimed retrieval costs.\nOn remand, the trial court will need to make this determination. (See Wagner, supra,\n145 Cal.App.4th at p. 779.)\n       Planning Department Labor Costs to Locate Documents Provided to Petitioners\n       The City additionally seeks $8,053.12 for staff time spent responding to\npetitioners’ request for “all files relating to all projects . . . within the Market-Octavia\nproject area.” The City maintains this document request was not reasonably related to\npetitioners’ efforts to prepare the record, themselves, under section 21167.6, subdivision\n(b)(2), petitioners therefore violated their statutory obligation under subdivision (f) to\nlimit record preparation costs, and the City should, accordingly, recover its production\ncosts under St. Vincent’s School.\n       The trial court found, however, petitioners’ document request did not approach the\negregious abuse that occurred in St. Vincent’s School, thus implicitly finding petitioners\ndid not “abandon[ their] statutory duty to contain costs.” (See St. Vincent’s School,\nsupra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 1018.) The court’s determination in this regard is\nadequately supported by the record. In St. Vincent’s School, after the city produced 20\nboxes of material, the petitioner subjected the city “to a costly and lengthy process of\ntrawling through its entire computer system”—“not because it had identified any ‘gaps’\nin the voluminous planning documents” the city had produced, but because it was “not\n\n\n                                               17\n\fsatisfied with the number of emails” in the 20 boxes. (Id. at p. 1018.) Even after the city\ncombed its computer systems, the petitioner remained dissatisfied because the few\nadditional e-mails the city produced were almost entirely nonsubstantive and duplicative.\n(Ibid.) So, the petitioner made yet a further demand. At the same time, it was able to file\nthe record and its merits brief, without ever receiving the supposed trove of e-mails it\nmaintained must exist. (Id. at pp. 1017–1018.) Here, in contrast, petitioners made their\ndocument request at the outset of the litigation, during the time they were gathering\ntogether materials to prepare the record. The trial court reasonably distinguished St.\nVincent’s School and did not abuse its discretion in denying the City’s document\nproduction costs claimed pursuant to the reasoning of that case.7\n       Production of “Excerpts of Record”\n       The City seeks $382.32 for copying and binding a four-volume “Excerpts of\nRecord.” The excerpts were copies of selected materials in the record of proceedings,\nand were proffered as an aide to the trial court. We conclude an “excerpt of record” in a\nmandamus action can qualify as a photocopy of an exhibit under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1033.5, subdivision (a)(13) (allowing costs of “[m]odels and blowups of exhibits”\nand “photocopies of exhibits” if “they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact”),\nsince it can serve the same purpose—to direct the trial court’s attention to material the\nparty maintains is especially relevant. (See Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012)\n203 Cal.App.4th 49, 59 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 607] [while “evidence was presented to the jury\nthrough audiovisual equipment,” party objecting to exhibit costs “overlook[ed] the fact\nthat counsel (for both sides), the witnesses, and the judge all used paper exhibits, in trial\nbinders” without which “it would have been even more difficult to conduct this trial than\nit already was”].)\n\n\n\n       7\n          We therefore need not, and do not, consider petitioners’ alternative argument\nthat the City cannot recover its production costs because petitioners sought these\ndocuments under the Public Records Act, under which a governmental entity is not\nentitled to recover production costs.\n\n\n                                              18\n\f       Since the trial court denied costs entirely, it did not review the City’s claimed\ncosts of preparing the “Excerpts of Record” and, thus, did not make any determination as\nto its helpfulness to the court or reasonableness under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1033.5, subdivisions (a)(13). On remand, the trial court will need to make this\ndetermination.\n       City’s Copy of Record Prepared by Petitioners\n       The city also seeks $804.35 it paid petitioners for a copy of the record petitioners\nprepared and submitted to the City. Petitioners state that after they provided the City\nwith their record for certification and submission to the trial court, the City asked to keep\nit. Petitioners agreed, but charged the City the cost of making another copy for the court.\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4), allows cost items not\nlisted in subdivision (a) “in the court’s discretion”. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.\n(c)(4).) Since the trial court denied costs entirely, it did not review the City’s claimed\ncost of procuring a copy of the record prepared by petitioners. On remand, the court will\nneed to consider the City’s claim and exercise its discretion. (See Wagner Farmers,\nsupra, 145 Cal.App.4th at pp. 776–777 [affirming trial court’s exercise of its discretion in\nallowing as “reasonably necessary,” agency’s costs of preparing five copies of record,\nincluding copies for itself, its outside counsel and its environmental consultant].)\n       Overnight Service Costs\n       The City additionally seeks approximately $1,090 for express delivery, postage\ncosts, and messenger costs for court filings. Postage and express delivery costs are\nexpressly disallowed as costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision\n(b). (Gorman, supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 75.) “Messenger fees,” though “not\nexpressly authorized by statute . . . may be allowed in the discretion of the court” under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4). (See Foothill-De Anza\nCommunity College Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 678]\n[costs of messenger court filings].)\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       Since the trial court denied costs entirely, it did not review the City’s claimed\nmessenger costs for court filings. On remand, the court will need to consider this cost\nitem and exercise its discretion.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The order granting petitioners’ motion to tax costs is affirmed to the extent it\ndenied the City’s claimed costs for responding to petitioners’ document request, and for\npostage and express delivery. In all other respects the order is reversed and the matter\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The parties shall bear\ntheir own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f                                              _________________________\n                                              Banke, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nMargulies, Acting P.

INTRODUCTION\n        The City and County of San Francisco (City) prevailed in this California\nEnvironmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)1 writ\nproceeding brought by the Coalition for Adequate Review and Alliance for\nComprehensive Planning (collectively, petitioners). After securing judgment, the City\nfiled a memorandum of costs totaling $64,144, largely for costs incurred in preparing a\nsupplemental record of the proceedings. Petitioners filed a motion to tax. The trial court\ngranted the motion and denied all costs. The court’s reasoning was two-fold: First, it\nrelied on the fact petitioners had elected to prepare the record, themselves, as allowed by\nCEQA’s record preparation statute (§ 21167.6, subd. (b)(2)). Second, it feared sizeable\ncost awards would have a chilling effect on lawsuits challenging important public\nprojects. Neither rationale is a legally permissible basis for denying record preparation\ncosts to the City. We therefore reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n        1\n        All further statutory references are to the Public Resources Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                             1\n\f                     II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In our prior opinion affirming the denial of petitioners’ writ petition on the merits\n(Coalition for Adequate Review v. City and County of San Francisco (June 25, 2013,\nA131487) [nonpub. opn.]), we discussed at length the land use plans, rezoning, and\nprojects around Octavia and Market streets at issue in this case. We need set forth here\nonly the facts relevant to the City’s appeal from the order granting petitioners’ motion to\ntax costs.\nInitial Record Preparation\n       Petitioners chose to prepare the record of proceedings, themselves, as permitted by\nCEQA’s record preparation statute, specifically, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). The\nCity maintains it thereupon made available some 26,000 pages of material to facilitate\npetitioners’ preparation of the record. Petitioners contend the City, in fact, obstructed and\ndelayed access to these documents and made the process of copying unduly cumbersome\nand expensive. Petitioners also contend that at 4 p.m. the day before they were, by\nagreement, to present the record to the City for its review and certification, the City\nsuddenly notified them of an additional 3,000 pages of material and a CD of unknown\nvolume, and claimed it was going to prepare a supplemental record containing these\nitems. The City did not produce this material to petitioners until a few weeks later.\nNevertheless, on August 28, 2008, the agreed-upon date, petitioners presented the City\nwith a 30-volume record, totaling 8,306 pages in length.\n       Two weeks later, on September 12, 2008, the City certified the record petitioners\nhad prepared, but only in part, stating it was incomplete. It appeared to the City that\npetitioners had omitted documents statutorily required to be in the record under\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (e), and which the City had, at least at some point, made\navailable to petitioners. The City therefore notified petitioners it reserved the right to\nseek inclusion of any of the additional 21,000-plus pages of material it had produced to\npetitioners which were not already in the record.\n       The City then made several attempts to add materials to the record—both through\nex parte applications and by negotiations with petitioners. During negotiations, the City\n\n\n                                              2\n\fproposed augmenting the record when it filed its opposition to the writ petition in order to\navoid including unnecessary materials.\n       As part of a November 19, 2008, case management statement, the City attached an\nindex of its proposed additions to the record, totaling 4,809 pages in 12 volumes. A\nmonth later, on December 12, 2008, the City formally moved to supplement the record of\nthe proceedings with these 12 volumes.\n       Petitioners opposed the motion. They argued they were in control of the record,\nand the City had no right to make additions. They also asserted the City sought to add\nirrelevant and duplicative materials, and the proposed supplement was a ploy to raise\ncosts. Petitioners denied having excluded from the record any materials that supported\nthe City’s approval of the project.\n       The City disputed petitioners’ contentions about the proposed supplemental\nrecord, except for 10 documents which it acknowledged were duplicates or near\nduplicates of materials already in the record prepared by petitioners. The City also\nmaintained it timely produced most of the required documents, except for certain studies\ncited in the EIR, which it made available to petitioners after learning of the omission.\n       On May 12, 2009, the trial court (Judge Feinstein) granted the City’s motion to\nsupplement the record, finding petitioners had omitted materials statutorily required to be\nin the record under section 21167.6, subdivision (e). It disallowed, however, the 10\nconcededly duplicative documents (approximately 250 pages of the 4,809-page proposed\nsupplement). The court also expressly rejected petitioners’ assertion that the City’s\nefforts to supplement the record violated its statutory duty to control record preparation\ncosts, set forth in section 21167.7, subdivision (f). The court noted in this regard\npetitioners had rejected the City’s proposal to file a supplemental record when it filed its\nopposition to the writ petition and, instead, had insisted the record be fixed before\nbriefing on the merits. The court also ruled “[w]ithout prejudice to the City’s ability to\nseek cost recovery at the conclusion of this litigation, as appropriate, Petitioners shall pay\nto the City the reproduction costs associated with Petitioners’ copy and the court’s copy\nof the City’s Supplement.” Petitioners moved for rehearing, arguing the immediate order\n\n\n                                              3\n\fto pay for reproduction costs was improper. In August 2009, the court denied rehearing,\nconcluding the issue of interim reproduction costs had been briefed and properly\ndetermined.2\nDocument Requests\n       In addition to the supplemental record dispute, the parties also sparred over\nwhether certain document requests petitioners made at the outset of the litigation were\noverbroad and burdensome. Petitioners, for instance, requested production of “[a]ll files\nrelating to all projects, including all proposed developments, public works and building\nprojects and building permits of any kind that are either within the pipeline or not within\nthe pipeline but within the Market-Octavia project area . . . .” (Emphasis omitted.) The\nCity viewed these requests as creating busywork unrelated to the writ petition.\nPetitioners viewed them as essential to their writ petition, and even without regard to the\npending litigation, legitimate under the State’s Public Record Act (Gov. Code, § 6250 et\nseq.) and City’s Sunshine Ordinance.\nMerits Hearing and Cost Proceedings\n       Ultimately, the trial court (Judge Sullivan) denied the petition for writ of mandate\non the merits. In so doing, the court adopted a lengthy proposed statement of decision\nprepared by the City. The statement largely cited to the record prepared by petitioners,\nbut made a few citations to the supplemental record.\n       The City then filed a memorandum of costs, seeking $64,144 for “administrative\nrecord, professional messenger, and service.” This included $3,231.62 for production\n(copying, binding, and page numbering) of the supplemental record; $383.32 for\nproduction (copying and binding) of a four-volume “excerpts of record;” $804.34 the\npetitioners had charged the City for a copy of the record they prepared; $50,191.50 for\nparalegal time; $8,053.14 for City Planning Department time; and $1,480.36 for\nprofessional couriers.\n\n       2\n          The City therefore made a demand for $1,764.80 in copying costs. Whether this\nwas paid at the time, or whether it was included in the record preparation costs the City\nlater claimed in its memorandum of costs, is unclear.\n\n                                             4\n\f       Petitioners moved to tax costs. They maintained section 21167.6, subdivision\n(b)(2)—pursuant to which petitioners had prepared the record—precluded the recovery of\nany record preparation costs by the City. They also specifically objected to the City’s\nclaimed costs related to the excerpts of record, paralegal and staff costs, and courier fees,\nand additionally claimed that, even if allowable, all the costs were unnecessary and\nunreasonable. In the latter regard, petitioners maintained the supplemental record played\nno meaningful role in the resolution of the writ petition. The City opposed the motion on\nall grounds.\n       Following a hearing, the trial court (Judge Sullivan) issued an order granting the\nmotion to tax and denying all costs. The court concluded petitioners were “not liable” for\ncosts “under . . . section 21167.6(b)(2),” reasoning the City, not petitioners, sought to\nsupplement the record and therefore the City should bear the cost of supplementation.\nAncillary to this conclusion, the court concluded petitioners’ discovery requests were not\n“extraordinary” and not the “but for” cause of the City’s claimed costs. The court further\nconcluded a cost award as large as the City sought would “certainly chill any desire by\nmembers of the general public to seek court review of important civic undertakings,”\nobserving petitioners had made neither a frivolous nor bad faith challenge to an\n“important” project. The City timely appealed.\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review\n       The standard of review applicable to a cost order depends on the issue raised on\nappeal. When the question is whether a claimed cost comes within the general cost\nstatutes and is recoverable at all, the question is one of statutory interpretation, subject to\nde novo review.

CEQA’s Record Preparation Statute (§ 21167.6)\n       Public Resources Code section 21167.6 is one of several statutes spelling out the\nprocedures for challenging a CEQA determination. (See Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21167\net seq.) The statute applies to any CEQA challenge, whether brought as a traditional\nmandamus proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (Pub. Resources\nCode, § 21168.5) or as an administrative mandamus proceeding under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1094.5 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168). It addresses both the\npreparation of the “record of proceedings” upon the commencement of an action (Pub.\nResources Code, § 21167.6, subds. (a)–(f)) and the preparation of the “clerk’s transcript\non appeal” if an appeal is taken from the judgment in such an action (id., subd. (g)). (See\nMadera Oversight Coalition, Inc. v.

We are concerned here with the preparation of the record of proceedings.3\n\n       3\n         The “record of proceedings” is often referred to as the “administrative record,”\nregardless of whether the challenge is brought as a traditional or administrative\nmandamus action. (Madera Oversight Coalition, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 61, fn. 4.)\n\n                                              6\n\f       Section 21167.6 provides flexibility as to how the record of proceedings is\nprepared. The traditional procedure is set forth in subdivision (a), which provides in\npertinent part: “At the time the action or proceeding is filed, the plaintiff or petitioner\nshall file a request that the respondent public agency prepare the record of proceedings\n. . . . The request, together with the complaint or petition, shall be served personally upon\nthe public agency not later than 10 business days from the date that the action or\nproceeding was filed.” (§ 21167.6, subd. (a).) The statute also provides for other record\npreparation options to help reduce record preparation costs. Subdivision (b)(2), thus,\nprovides: “The plaintiff or petitioner may elect to prepare the record of proceedings or\nthe parties may agree to an alternative method of preparation of the record of\nproceedings, subject to certification of its accuracy by the public agency, within the time\nlimit specified in this subdivision.” (§ 21167.6, subd. (b)(2); see generally St. Vincent’s\nSchool for Boys, Catholic Charities CYO v. City of San Rafael (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2275323\"><a href=\"/opinion/2275323/st-vincents-school-for-boys-v-city-of-san-rafael/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">] (St. Vincent’s School).)\n       Additional specifics with respect to the handling of the record are set forth in\nsubdivision (b)(1). It provides: “The public agency shall prepare and certify the record\nof proceedings not later than 60 days from the date that the request specified in\nsubdivision (a) was served upon the public agency. Upon certification, the public agency\nshall lodge a copy of the record of proceedings with the court and shall serve on the\nparties notice that the record of proceedings has been certified and lodged with the court.\nThe parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the\nrecord of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court . . . .” (§ 21167.6,\nsubd. (b)(1).) Subdivision (c), in turn, provides the 60-day period for certification may be\nextended by stipulation of the parties or by court order. (Id., subd. (c).)\n       Thus, CEQA’s record preparation cost provision, in particular, appears at the end\nof the subdivision that begins by spelling out an agency’s 60-day certification obligation\nupon being served with a request to prepare the record (§ 21167.6, subd. (a)) or upon\nbeing provided with a record prepared by the petitioner or party or by some other, agreed-\nto means (id., subd. (b)(2)). The cost provision, by its plain terms, places the costs an\n\n\n                                              7\n\fagency incurs in preparing the record on the parties, not the public agency. (Ibid.; see\nBlack Historical Society v. City of San Diego (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251330\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251330/black-historical-society-v-san-diego/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The rationale for doing so is that\n“ ‘taxpayers . . . should not have to bear the cost of preparing the administrative record in\na lawsuit brought by a private individual or entity.’ ”4 (Black Historical Society, supra,\n134 Cal.App.4th at p. 677, quoting River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.)\n       Accordingly, a petitioner can be ordered to pay for a requested record during the\nearly stages of the litigation, before the merits of the case are ever heard. (See, e.g., San\nDiego Citizenry Group v. County of San Diego (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10\n[</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Indeed, a public agency can refuse to release\na record it has been asked to prepare until the petitioner making the request has paid the\nagency’s preparation costs. (Black Historical Society, at pp. 674, 677–678.)\n       This does not mean a public agency can charge a petitioner or party whatever it\nwants for preparing the record. Section 21167.6, subdivision (f), mandates the “party\npreparing the record shall strive to do so at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the\nrecord.” (§ 21167.6, subd. (f); see generally St. Vincent’s School, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1014–1019 [discussing the “cost-containment policy embodied in\n\n       4\n          In fact, in one of the earliest cases discussing an agency’s recoupment of record\npreparation costs under section 21167.6, the Court of Appeal affirmed the agency’s\nrecovery of such costs and the denial of the petitioner’s motion to tax, even though the\nappellate court reversed the decision on the merits that had been in favor of the agency.\nThe trial court had not, however, examined the reasonableness of the agency’s claimed\ncosts and was directed to do so on remand.

A petitioner can also, by interim motion, challenge an agency’s\nrecord preparation charge as excessive or unreasonable. (See, e.g., River Valley, supra,\n37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 164, 180–182 [during initial stages of the litigation, petitioner filed\n“motion to determine the costs of preparing the administrative record”].) Similarly, a\npetitioner can, by interim motion, challenge a record prepared by a public agency as\nbeing incomplete or as including documents not properly part of the record. (See, e.g.,\nCitizens for Ceres v. Superior Court (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 900–901 [during early\nstages of litigation, petitioner filed objection to certified record claiming city’s exclusion\nof documents on attorney-client and work product grounds was erroneous; appellate court\ngranted interlocutory writ review of trial court’s interim order and granted writ relief in\npart]; Madera Oversight Coalition, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at pp. 63–66 [case\nmanagement order specified record disputes were to be raised no later than merits\nbriefing; petitioners then filed multiple requests that certified record be augmented, which\ntrial court ruled on at same time it ruled on merits].)\n        With this overview of CEQA’s record preparation statute, we turn to the principal\nissue on appeal—whether petitioners’ election to prepare the record, themselves, under\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), precludes an award of record preparation costs to the\nCity.\nC. A Petitioner’s Election to Prepare the Record Does Not Preclude a Public Agency\nFrom Recovering Supplemental Record Preparation Costs When Incurred to Ensure a\nStatutorily Complete Record\n       Petitioners maintain the whole point of CEQA’s alternative record preparation\nprovisions is to avoid agency preparation costs, and, therefore, their election to prepare\nthe record under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), precludes any award of such costs to\nthe City. The trial court appears to have taken a more nuanced approach and concluded a\npetitioner’s election under subdivision (b)(2) precludes an agency from recovering record\npreparation costs except in “extraordinary” circumstances like those in St. Vincent’s\nSchool.\n        In St. Vincent’s School, the plaintiff also chose to prepare the record. (St.\nVincent’s School, supra, 161Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) To enable it to do so, the city was\n\n                                               9\n\frequired to locate 2,208 documents, totaling more than 58,000 pages, which ultimately\ntook up more than 20 boxes. (Id. at p. 1017.) Noting few e-mails were included, the\nplaintiff filed a Public Records Act (Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.) request asking the city for\n“all writings evidencing or reflecting communications, stored on [any city] computer hard\ndrive or server” relating to the property in question. (St. Vincent’s School, at p. 1017.)\nThis required the city to review nine more boxes of materials. (Ibid.) After the city\nprovided copies of all responsive, nonprivileged documents, the petitioner made yet\nanother demand to inspect documents. (Id. at pp. 1017–1018.) Before this last set of\ndemands was resolved, the plaintiff filed its merits brief in support of its writ petition.\n(Id. at p. 1018.) After the city prevailed on the merits, it sought and was awarded\n$26,362.50 in costs incurred in searching its computer files. (Id. at p. 1013.)\n       The Court of Appeal affirmed. It first addressed and rejected the same argument\nthe plaintiffs make here—that because the plaintiff chose to prepare the record under\nsubdivision (b)(2), the city was foreclosed from recovering any record preparation costs.\n(St. Vincent’s School, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1014–1019.) The court pointed out\nthe city was not seeking to recover “the entire cost for preparation.” (Id. at p. 1014.) It\nfurther concluded disallowing the city’s costs would undermine the cost-containment\npolicies embodied in section 21167.6, subdivision (f), and reward the petitioner for\nabusive document demands. (St. Vincent’s School, at pp. 1018–1019.) “St. Vincent’s\nactions, which caused the City to expend considerable time and resources in responding\nto its discovery demands, reflect a complete abandonment of its statutory responsibility to\n‘strive to [prepare the record] at reasonable cost.’ ” (Id. at p. 1019.) The appellate court\nthus concluded “section 21167.6 does not preclude an award of costs in favor of the\nCity.” (Ibid.) It also concluded the trial court had not abused its discretion as to the\namount awarded. (Ibid.)\n       We agree with St. Vincent’s School that the fact a petitioner elects to prepare the\nrecord under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), does not ipso facto bar the recovery of\nrecord preparation costs by a public agency. Subdivision (b)(2) contains no such\nprohibition. Moreover, that subdivision expressly refers to and incorporates the 60-day\n\n\n                                              10\n\fperiod for record certification set forth in the first sentence of subdivision (b)(1).\n(§ 21167.6, subd. (b)(2).) Thus, the two subdivisions are inter-related. The record\npreparation cost provision—specifying the parties, not the public agency, are to pay for\nthe record—is, as we have discussed, set forth in the third and final sentence of\nsubdivision (b)(1) and, significantly, does not refer to any particular means by which the\nrecord is prepared. (Id., subd. (b)(1).) Finally, as St. Vincent’s School recognized, the\nfact a petitioner makes an election to proceed under subdivision (b)(2), does not mean the\nagency will never, under any circumstances, incur record preparation costs.\n       The trial court appears to have read St. Vincent’s School as identifying the only\ncircumstance in which an agency can recoup record preparation costs where the petitioner\nhas chosen to prepare the record under subdivision (b)(2), i.e., where the petitioner has\nmade “extraordinary” production demands purportedly in connection with its preparation\nof the record. The appellate court did not suggest, however, it was doing anything other\nthan addressing the particular circumstances before it. We therefore do not read St.\nVincent’s School as drawing the bounds of an agency’s recovery of record preparation\ncosts where the petitioner has opted to prepare the record under subdivision (b)(2).\n       There is no question the alternative record preparation procedures authorized by\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), are intended to reduce record preparation costs. (See\ngenerally Hayward Area Planning, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 183–184 [discussing\ncost control provisions of § 21167.6].)\n       But just as a record prepared by an agency at the request of a petitioner under\nsubdivision (a) must be complete, so, too, must a record prepared by alternative means\nunder subdivision (b)(2). (See § 21167.6, subd. (e); see Madera Oversight Coalition,\nsupra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 62 [“[r]egardless of which [record preparation] method is\nchosen, the administrative record is ‘subject to certification of its accuracy by the public\nagency’ ” quoting § 21167.6, subd. (b)(2)].) When a record prepared under\nsubdivision (b)(2) is incomplete, and an agency is put to the task of supplementation to\nensure completeness, the language of the statute allows, and the purpose of the record\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fpreparation cost provision to protect public monies counsels, that the agency recoup the\ncosts of preparing the supplemental record.\n       CEQA is clear about what the record must contain—it “shall include,” at a\nminimum, the documents enumerated in section 21167.6, subdivision (e). (See San\nDiego Citizenry, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 26–27 [subdivision (e) specifies the\nmaterials “required” to be in the record].)

Rather, it\nfiled a motion for leave to do so, identifying the documents it intended to include.\nPetitioners filed opposition, making some of the same arguments they have made in\nopposition to the City’s claimed record preparation costs. The trial court granted the\nCity’s motion, but not entirely, excluding from the supplemental record documents that\nessentially duplicated documents already included in the record petitioners had prepared.\nAs to the documents the trial court allowed, it expressly found they were statutorily\nrequired to be in the record under section 21167.6, subdivision (e). The court also\nexpressly found the City’s preparation of a supplemental record to include these\ndocuments did not violate the City’s obligation under subdivision (f) to minimize record\npreparation costs. In our prior opinion we affirmed the court’s supplementation order,\nincluding on the ground petitioners failed to carry their burden on appeal to demonstrate\nerror. (Coalition for Adequate Review v. City and County of San Francisco, supra,\nA131487.)\n       Under these circumstances, we have no trouble concluding the City was\neffectively put to the task of preparing a statutorily complete record and, therefore, may\nrecover its reasonable costs of preparing the supplemental record.5\n\n\n       5\n         At oral argument, petitioners argued that, in light of their election to prepare the\nrecord under subdivision (b)(2), the City improperly moved to prepare a supplemental\nrecord and, instead, should have moved for an order directing petitioners to prepare the\ndesired supplement. Petitioners never made this assertion in the trial court.

Yet, Public Resources\nCode section 21168, by referencing Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, expressly\nprovides for the prevailing party in a CEQA administrative mandamus proceeding to\nrecover the costs of record preparation.

Thus, CEQA,\nitself, refutes a general “chill” rationale to deny record preparation costs to a public\nagency. (See also San Diego Citizenry, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at p. 11 [affirming\nagency’s request for record preparation costs and quoting trial court’s observation that\n“ ‘[g]roups like petitioner are free to exercise their petition rights, but as has been often\nsaid in other contexts, freedom is not free’ ”].) Furthermore, as we have discussed,\nsection 21167.6, subdivision (b)(1), expressly provides that the parties, not the public\nagency, are to pay record preparation costs. This statutory obligation implements a\n\nopposed the City’s motion to file a supplemental record on numerous grounds, they never\nargued the City was asking for inappropriate relief and never claimed, if the trial court\nwas inclined to allow a supplemental record, they should be the ones to prepare it.

As we have discussed, Madera\nOversight Coalition generally discusses the trial court’s power to resolve record disputes.\n(Madera Oversight Coalition, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at pp. 63–64.) Leavitt recognizes a\ntrial court can impose terminating sanctions when a petitioner undertakes but fails to\ncomplete the record preparation process, but only if “given an opportunity to comply.”\n(Leavitt, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at p. 1526.) Neither case even suggests a public agency\ncannot, itself, take action to ensure a statutorily complete record where, as here, the\npetitioner disputes the agency’s assessment that the record is incomplete.\n\n\n                                              14\n\fdifferent, but equally important policy—that public monies should not be used to fund\nCEQA challenges brought by private parties. (See Black Historical Society, supra,\n134 Cal.App.4th at p. 677; River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.) This policy is\nall the more compelling where, as here, a private party loses its CEQA challenge on the\nmerits.\n          We thus conclude the trial court erred in its interpretation of CEQA’s record\npreparation statute and reverse that portion of the order denying supplemental record\npreparation costs to the City, and remand for further proceedings.\nD. Specific Cost Items\n          In addition to insisting their election to prepare the record under section 21167.6,\nsubdivision (b)(2), constituted a bar to the City’s recovery of supplemental record\npreparation costs, petitioners also challenged the reasonableness of the City’s claimed\ncosts. Because the trial court denied costs entirely, it did not consider the reasonableness\nof the City’s claimed costs. On remand, it must exercise its discretion in this regard.\n(See Wagner Farms, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at pp. 772–773; Citizens for Quality\nGrowth, supra, 198 Cal.App.3d at p. 448.) To provide further guidance on remand, we\nturn to specific cost items sought by the City.6\n          Paralegal Costs Related to Supplemental Record\n          In addition to the costs of copying, binding, and page numbering the supplemental\nrecord, the City seeks approximately $50,000 for over 300 hours of paralegal time (at a\nrate of between $159 to $165 per hour) in connection with preparing the supplemental\nrecord. The City submitted billing records showing time spent reviewing the record\nprepared by petitioners for certification, reviewing other materials for inclusion in a\nsupplemental record, organizing those documents, preparing an index, working with\nvendors on the supplemental record, and meeting with attorneys.\n          6\n          Petitioners may not, on remand, challenge the reasonableness of the contents of\nthe supplemental record and contend any of the documents need not have been included.\nAs we have discussed, the trial court long ago determined the materials included in the\nsupplemental record were statutorily required under section 21167.6, subdivision (e), and\nthat determination has been affirmed on appeal.\n\n\n                                                15\n\f       The City may claim reimbursement for reasonable labor costs required to prepare\nthe supplemental record. (See California Oak Foundation, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 293–295 [affirming $46,563 in costs for “labor in compiling the record,” including\nparalegal time; university personnel “retrieved, reviewed, organized, and indexed over\n40,000 pages of documents”]; River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 181–182\n[affirming costs for time spent by assistant transportation engineer and paralegal\nreviewing and compiling documents].)\n       However, we have been cited no authority, nor are we aware of any, indicating\nlabor costs to review a petitioner-prepared record of proceedings “for completeness” in\nconnection with certification pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(1), are\nrecoverable record preparation costs. This sort of review is a chore public agencies face\nin every case in which the petitioner elects to prepare the record under subdivision (b)(2),\nand if an agency could always claim a sizeable amount for review “for completeness” or\n“certification,” that would defeat the Legislature’s aim of providing for lower-cost record\npreparation alternatives. (§ 21167.6, subds. (b)(2), (f); cf. Hayward Area Planning,\nsupra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 183–186 [denying city’s claimed record preparation costs\nbecause delegating preparation to real party in interest “undermined the statutory scheme\nfor controlling the costs of record preparation”].) Additionally, record review “for\ncompleteness” can easily blur into review for strategy, implicating the kind of attorney\nfee award neither authorized nor sought here. (See Wagner Farms, supra,\n145 Cal.App.4th at p. 779 [drawing distinction between time agency employees spent\nthat was “necessary for preparation” of record and time “that went beyond that merely\nrelated to prepar[ation],” such as preparing the agency’s own case].)\n       Because the trial court denied record preparation costs entirely, it did not review\nthe City’s claimed paralegal costs to determine which of these costs were for work\nreasonably required to prepare the supplemental record (e.g., locating, copying, indexing,\nand assembling documents) and are recoverable, and which were for review of the record\npetitioners prepared “for completeness” and are not recoverable. On remand, the trial\ncourt will need to make this determination. (See Wagner, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at\n\n\n                                             16\n\fp. 779 [where claimed labor costs could not be segregated between time attributable to\npreparing record and other tasks, matter was remanded for further proceedings].)\n       Costs to Retrieve Documents to Prepare Record\n       The City also seeks approximately $392 for messenger costs for transporting\nrecord materials between the City’s planning department and City Hall. To the extent\nthese retrieval costs were incurred, as the City asserts, in compiling the supplemental\nrecord, we discern no material difference between these costs and other labor costs of\nassembling the record, and they are recoverable. (See California Oak Foundation,\nsupra,188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 294–295 [affirming costs for retrieving documents “located\nin many departments throughout the campus”].) But because the trial court denied costs\nentirely, it also did not review the reasonableness of the City’s claimed retrieval costs.\nOn remand, the trial court will need to make this determination. (See Wagner, supra,\n145 Cal.App.4th at p. 779.)\n       Planning Department Labor Costs to Locate Documents Provided to Petitioners\n       The City additionally seeks $8,053.12 for staff time spent responding to\npetitioners’ request for “all files relating to all projects . . . within the Market-Octavia\nproject area.” The City maintains this document request was not reasonably related to\npetitioners’ efforts to prepare the record, themselves, under section 21167.6, subdivision\n(b)(2), petitioners therefore violated their statutory obligation under subdivision (f) to\nlimit record preparation costs, and the City should, accordingly, recover its production\ncosts under St. Vincent’s School.\n       The trial court found, however, petitioners’ document request did not approach the\negregious abuse that occurred in St. Vincent’s School, thus implicitly finding petitioners\ndid not “abandon[ their] statutory duty to contain costs.” (See St. Vincent’s School,\nsupra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 1018.) The court’s determination in this regard is\nadequately supported by the record. In St. Vincent’s School, after the city produced 20\nboxes of material, the petitioner subjected the city “to a costly and lengthy process of\ntrawling through its entire computer system”—“not because it had identified any ‘gaps’\nin the voluminous planning documents” the city had produced, but because it was “not\n\n\n                                               17\n\fsatisfied with the number of emails” in the 20 boxes. (Id. at p. 1018.) Even after the city\ncombed its computer systems, the petitioner remained dissatisfied because the few\nadditional e-mails the city produced were almost entirely nonsubstantive and duplicative.\n(Ibid.) So, the petitioner made yet a further demand. At the same time, it was able to file\nthe record and its merits brief, without ever receiving the supposed trove of e-mails it\nmaintained must exist. (Id. at pp. 1017–1018.) Here, in contrast, petitioners made their\ndocument request at the outset of the litigation, during the time they were gathering\ntogether materials to prepare the record. The trial court reasonably distinguished St.\nVincent’s School and did not abuse its discretion in denying the City’s document\nproduction costs claimed pursuant to the reasoning of that case.7\n       Production of “Excerpts of Record”\n       The City seeks $382.32 for copying and binding a four-volume “Excerpts of\nRecord.” The excerpts were copies of selected materials in the record of proceedings,\nand were proffered as an aide to the trial court. We conclude an “excerpt of record” in a\nmandamus action can qualify as a photocopy of an exhibit under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1033.5, subdivision (a)(13) (allowing costs of “[m]odels and blowups of exhibits”\nand “photocopies of exhibits” if “they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact”),\nsince it can serve the same purpose—to direct the trial court’s attention to material the\nparty maintains is especially relevant.

On remand, the trial court will need to make this\ndetermination.\n       City’s Copy of Record Prepared by Petitioners\n       The city also seeks $804.35 it paid petitioners for a copy of the record petitioners\nprepared and submitted to the City. Petitioners state that after they provided the City\nwith their record for certification and submission to the trial court, the City asked to keep\nit. Petitioners agreed, but charged the City the cost of making another copy for the court.\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4), allows cost items not\nlisted in subdivision (a) “in the court’s discretion”. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.\n(c)(4).) Since the trial court denied costs entirely, it did not review the City’s claimed\ncost of procuring a copy of the record prepared by petitioners. On remand, the court will\nneed to consider the City’s claim and exercise its discretion. (See Wagner Farmers,\nsupra, 145 Cal.App.4th at pp. 776–777 [affirming trial court’s exercise of its discretion in\nallowing as “reasonably necessary,” agency’s costs of preparing five copies of record,\nincluding copies for itself, its outside counsel and its environmental consultant].)\n       Overnight Service Costs\n       The City additionally seeks approximately $1,090 for express delivery, postage\ncosts, and messenger costs for court filings.
