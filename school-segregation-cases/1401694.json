See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g). Young filed the instant mandamus petition to\n\n\n  1\n    “Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly restrictive conditions,\ndesigned to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general prison population.”\nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 213 (2005).\n\fhave this Court declare the following laws unconstitutional: the “finality clause” of the\n\nJudicial Conduct Act and three provisions of the PLRA, including its three-strikes\n\nprovision.2 Young has also moved for appointment of counsel, an “emergency ruling” on\n\nhis mandamus petition, and “a stay of the dismissal of this case.”\n\n       Mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in the most extraordinary of\n\ncircumstances. See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., 418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.\n\n2005). Its “traditional use . . . has been ‘to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise\n\nof its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to\n\ndo so.’” In re School Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d 764, 773 (3d Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).\n\nAs such, there should be some underlying, within-circuit district court proceeding or\n\norder being challenged by the mandamus petitioner. See Madden v. Myers, 102 F.3d 74,\n\n76-77 (3d Cir. 1996) (“A writ of mandamus . . . constitutes a procedural mechanism\n\nthrough which a court of appeals reviews a carefully circumscribed and discrete category\n\nof district court orders.”); see also Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, 542\n\nU.S. 367, 380 (2004) (“The common-law writ of mandamus against a lower court is\n\ncodified at 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) . . ..”) (emphasis added); Rodgers v. U.S. Steel Corp., 508\n\nF.2d 152, 161 (3d Cir. 1975) (“The power to issue such writs in aid of our potential\n\nappellate jurisdiction comprehends our responsibility for the orderly and efficient\n\nadministration of justice within the circuit.”) (emphasis added).\n\n  2\n    Similar claims were improperly raised by Young in one of his recent habeas petitions.\nSee Young v. United States, 2010 WL 1506545, *2 (D. Mass. April 12, 2010).\n\n                                               2\n\f       Here, there is no underlying district court proceeding or order in this circuit about\n\nwhich Young complains. In fact, it does not appear that Young has ever been a party in a\n\nlegal action in this circuit prior to the mandamus petition at issue.3 We have no power to\n\nissue writs with respect to a matter not within our jurisdiction. See Russell v. United\n\nStates, 308 F.2d 78, 79 (9th Cir. 1962) (per curiam).\n\n       Accordingly, we will deny Young’s mandamus petition. Young’s pending motions\n\nare denied.\n\n\n\n\n  3\n    This should not be read as an invitation, and we note that Young has worn out his\nwelcome elsewhere. See Young v. United States, 88 Fed. Cl. 283, 291 (2009) (“The\nplaintiff continues to inundate the courts of the United States with his repetitive filings\nwithout waiting for a response from the courts. Mr. Young has made himself an example\nof the type of plaintiff Congress was trying to address when it enacted the [PLRA].”)\n\f",
