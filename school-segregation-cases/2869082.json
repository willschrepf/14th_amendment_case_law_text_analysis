S 1983 civil rights\nlawsuit that they brought against various YDC employees\nand supervisors. During their time at YDC, the plaintiffs\nwere sexually assaulted by Barry Whetzel, a YDC employee\nwho was working as a youth development aide at the time\nhe committed the assaults. Whetzel was eventually\nconvicted of criminal charges arising out of these incidents.\nBeers-Capitol and Tate then brought a civil rights action\nalleging violations of their Eighth Amendment rights and\nnaming as defendants: Whetzel; three of his supervisors,\nRobert Liggett, the Executive Director of YDC, Charles\nEarnhart, a YDC director, and Joseph Flecher, a YDC\nmanager; and two of his co-workers, Nora Burley, a YDC\ncounselor, and Shirley Robinson, a YDC youth development\naide. After the District Court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of all of the other defendants, the plaintif fs won a\n\fjudgment of $200,000 against Whetzel.\n\nAn Eighth Amendment claim against a prison official\nmust meet two requirements: (1) \"the deprivation alleged\nmust be, objectively, sufficiently serious;\" and (2) the\n\"prison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994)\n(quotation marks and citations omitted). In prison\nconditions cases, \"that state of mind is one of`deliberate\nindifference' to inmate health or safety.\" Id. \"Deliberate\nindifference\" is a subjective standar d under Farmer--the\nprison official-defendant must actually have known or been\naware of the excessive risk to inmate safety. The parties\nagree that the sexual assaults against Beers-Capitol and\nTate were sufficiently serious, so the determinative issue in\nthis case is whether the defendants' actions and inaction\nrose to the level of deliberate indiffer ence. Depending on the\nroles and responsibilities of the r espective defendants, the\nplaintiffs have set forth two bases for their claims of\ndeliberate indifference. With r espect to the defendants who\nare alleged to have had notice that Whetzel was having sex\nwith one or more of the female residents at YDC, the\nplaintiffs assert that these defendants took inadequate (or\nno) measures in response to this notice. W ith respect to the\ndefendants who are not alleged to have had knowledge of\nthe specific risk that Whetzel posed, the plaintif fs claim\nthat these defendants either implemented or failed to\n\n                                3\n\n\n\nimplement YDC policies that created a situation in which\nan employee like Whetzel would be able to sexually assault\nfemale residents at YDC without being discover ed for some\ntime, and that these defendants were awar e that such\npolicies created this risk but ignored it.\n\nWe will affirm the District Court's grant of summary\njudgment for defendants Liggett, Earnhart, Flecher, and\nRobinson, because the evidence that the plaintif fs proffer\nagainst these defendants fails to raise an infer ence that\nthese defendants actually knew or were awar e of the\nsignificant risk of harm to the plaintif fs. However, we will\nreverse the grant of summary judgment for defendant\nBurley, because the plaintiffs have pr esented evidence that\nBurley told one of the plaintiffs that she\"kind of knew\" that\nWhetzel was \"messing\" with the female r esidents at YDC.\nThis evidence, along with Burley's admission in her\ndeposition that she heard numerous rumors that Whetzel\nwas having sex with the female residents, is sufficient to\nraise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Burley was\naware of the significant risk that Whetzel posed to the\nplaintiffs but did not adequately respond to this risk.1\n\fI. Facts and Procedural History\n\nYDC is a Pennsylvania Department of Public W elfare\ninstitution that houses adjudicated delinquent juvenile\noffenders, both male and female; the female r esidents range\nin age between 13 and 21 years and come from all areas of\nthe state. YDC is divided into several \"Units,\" and each of\nthese Units is itself divided into several \"cottages.\" Beers-\nCapitol and Tate were housed in Unit 7, which contained\nthe female residents. Unit 7 is comprised of three cottages:\n7A, 7B, and 7C.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The defendants also raise a defense of qualified immunity. This issue\nwas not reached by the District Court (because it granted summary\njudgment on the merits). With regar d to the defendants for whom we will\naffirm summary judgment, we need not decide the issue of qualified\nimmunity. With regard to the defendant for whom we will reverse\nsummary judgment, her acts of deliberate indif ference to an excessive\nrisk to the plaintiffs foreclose her claim of qualified immunity. See\ninfra\nnote 15.\n\n                                  4\n\n\n\nDefendant Robert Liggett is the Executive Dir ector of\nYDC; as such he has ultimate responsibility for the overall\noperation of YDC. His duties include managing YDC's daily\noperation, supervising and training the staf f, and\nformulating and implementing all operational policies,\nregulations, and practices. Defendant Charles Lee Earnhart\nwas the unit director for Units 7 and 8 during the relevant\ntime period. Earnhart was responsible for the day-to-day\noperations of Unit 7, including the supervision of the staff\nof the unit, and the review and evaluation of staff reports\nand scheduled work. Liggett directly supervised Earnhart,\nwho in turn directly supervised the unit managers, meeting\nwith these managers daily. Defendant Joseph Flecher was\nthe unit manager for Unit 7 during the relevant time period.\nUnit managers are responsible for developing, coordinating,\nand administering program services for their unit; they also\ndirectly supervise the cottage supervisors within their unit.\nCottage supervisors directly supervise counselors, youth\ndevelopment aides, and other staff in their cottages (no\ncottage supervisor is a defendant in this case). Defendant\nNora Burley was a counselor who worked in Unit 7, and\ndefendant Shirley Robinson was a youth development aide\nin Unit 7. Counselors provide security in the units and\nmonitor resident interactions, and youth development aides\nperform a similar role. Whetzel was also a youth\ndevelopment aide in Unit 7.\n\fNew staff members at YDC receive two weeks of training\non YDC policies. Because the residents incar cerated at YDC\noften have previously suffered sexual abuse and have\nbecome sexually active at an early age, this training\nincludes instruction on how to identify and appr opriately\nhandle cases of sexual victimization and abuse, and how to\ndeal with female residents who express sexual interest in\nstaff members. The staff are taught that the YDC residents\nare likely to express attraction to them and to approach\nthem in a sexual manner, and that any sexual relations\nwith residents are unethical and absolutely forbidden. Alice\nPeoples, the Training Manager at YDC, testified that YDC\nemployees are taught that children who ar e sexually\nabused often afterwards deny that the abuse occurred.\nPeoples also stated that she informs YDC employees at\ntheir training that they are legally responsible to report any\n\n                                5\n\n\n\nallegations of abuse, and that failure to r eport such\nallegations could result in them being char ged with abuse\nthemselves.\n\nYDC is subject to 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6311, a\nPennsylvania state law on child abuse reporting which\nprovides that any staff member of a facility like YDC who\nreceives an allegation of abuse or otherwise becomes aware\nof such abuse must notify the person in char ge of the\nfacility (in this case, Executive Director Liggett).2 Earnhart\ntestified that there is no discretion for YDC employees\nunder this law; notification of any allegation of or\ninformation about abuse must go to Liggett. Liggett is then\nresponsible for initiating an investigation into the alleged\nabuse. Part of the process of such an investigation includes\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Title 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6311 pr ovides in pertinent part:\n\n       S 6311. Persons required to r eport suspected child abuse\n\n        (a) General rule.--Persons who, in the course of their employment,\n       occupation or practice of their profession, come into contact with\n       children shall report or cause a r eport to be made in accordance\n       with section 6313 (relating to reporting procedure) when they have\n       reasonable cause to suspect, on the basis of their medical,\n       professional or other training and experience, that a child coming\n       before them in their professional or official capacity is an abused\n       child. . . .\n\n        (b) Enumeration of persons required to report.--Persons required\n\f       to report under subsection (a) include, but ar e not limited to,\nany\n       . . . school administrator, school teacher , school nurse, social\n       services worker, day-care center worker or any other child-care or\n       foster-care worker, mental health professional, peace officer or\nlaw\n       enforcement official.\n\n        (c) Staff members of institutions, etc.--Whenever a person is\n       required to report under subsection (b) in the capacity as a member\n       of the staff of a medical or other public or private institution,\nschool,\n       facility or agency, that person shall immediately notify the person\nin\n       charge of the institution, school, facility or agency or the\ndesignated\n       agent of the person in charge. Upon notification, the person in\n       charge or the designated agent, if any, shall assume the\n       responsibility and have the legal obligation to report or cause a\n       report to be made in accordance with section 6313. This chapter\n       does not require more than one r eport from any such institution,\n       school, facility or agency.\n\n                               6\n\n\n\nsending notification of the alleged abuse within 24 hours to\nChild Line, a hotline for child abuse allegations. 3\n\nBecause this is an appeal of a grant of summary\njudgment, we must review the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the party against whom summary judgment\nwas entered. See Pi Lambda Phi Frater nity, Inc. v. University\nof Pittsburgh, 229 F.3d 435, 441 n.3 (3d Cir. 2000). We\ntherefore accept as true for the purposes of this appeal the\nplaintiffs' description of: (1) the abuse they suffered at YDC;\n(2) relevant abuse suffered by other residents; and (3) the\nactions and reactions of YDC staff when they were notified\nof such abuse.\n\nA. The Abuse Suffered by Beers-Capitol\n\nBeers-Capitol was 17 years old when she was\nincarcerated at YDC New Castle from February 3, 1994 to\nMarch 30, 1994. Whetzel started making sexual comments\nto Beers-Capitol a few weeks after she arrived. This\nescalated into Whetzel inappropriately touching Beers-\nCapitol in various public places at YDC. Whetzel then\nbegan waking Beers-Capitol up in the middle of the night to\nbring her into his office to molest her and ask her to have\nsex with him. When she refused, he took away her\nprivileges. Beers-Capitol eventually had sex with Whetzel\nabout a week or so before she was released, and she then\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Notwithstanding this training, there is evidence in the record that YDC\nemployees viewed claims made by residents with skepticism. Michael\nPogozelec, a counselor at YDC who is not a party in this case, testified\nin his deposition that\n\n       kids there [at YDC] are extr emely manipulative. When they come in,\n       they're used to getting their way any way they can out there on the\n       streets. . . . [A]ll of them came fr om homes that were highly\n       dysfunctional where they had to survive themselves either by\n       scheming, manipulating, intimidating, game-playing. So, staff\n       question things right off the bat. They don't believe everything\nthat\n       a student brings to their attention.\n\nThat this attitude was widespread at YDC is supported by a comment\ndefendant Flecher made to Robert McLean, an investigator hired by\nLiggett to look into allegations of abuse by Whetzel. Flecher told McLean\nthat \"these types of accusations [of sexual abuse] occur on a frequent\nbasis when female students become angry or upset with staff members.\"\n\n                               7\n\n\n\ncame to the conclusion that he had gotten her pr egnant.\nOn the day before she was released fr om YDC, Beers-\nCapitol was cleaning the unit's canteen with defendant\nShirley Robinson; at that time, she told Robinson that she\nhad had sex with Whetzel and that she believed Whetzel\nhad gotten her pregnant. Robinson did not believe that\nBeers-Capitol was serious in her allegation and r esponded\nby saying, \"Well, you know that you can get in trouble\nmaking accusations like that.\"\n\nIn her deposition, Robinson stated that, although\noriginally she did not believe Beers-Capitol's allegation, the\naccusation \"nagged\" her because she knew that any\nallegation had to be reported. She thus r eported the\naccusation to Earnhart the next day and wr ote up an\nincident report. According to Robinson's deposition, the\nfollowing day Earnhart called Beers-Capitol, who had been\nreleased by then, at her home in Erie, Pennsylvania, to\ncheck on the story, whereupon Beers-Capitol denied the\naccusation. However, according to Ear nhart's deposition,\nRobinson delayed for a longer period, possibly up to three\nweeks, before informing Earnhart of the allegation, and at\nthat point Earnhart asked defendant Flecher to call Beers-\nCapitol at home about the allegation, and Flecher did so at\nthat time.4 Beers-Capitol testified that someone from YDC\ncalled her at some point after her release and asked, \"Amie,\nwe have accusations we know Barry did not do. I need to\nask you, did you have sex with him?\" Beers-Capitol denied\n\fhaving sex with Whetzel.\n\nRobinson, Earnhart, and Flecher did not r eport Beers-\nCapitol's allegation to Liggett as requir ed by 23 Pa. Cons.\nStat. S 6311. Earnhart did check with the Medical\nDepartment and was informed that Beers-Capitol had had\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Earnhart's testimony on this issue is somewhat confused. His first\nresponse was that he did not think Robinson delayed three weeks in\nreporting the allegation to him, but when confr onted with the fact that\nFlecher's file notes show that the phone call to Beers-Capitol was made\nthree weeks after Beers-Capitol made her allegation, he seems to imply\nthat Robinson did in fact delay her report of the allegation for three\nweeks. Beers-Capitol's deposition is unclear as to who called her and\nwhen, except that the caller was a male YDC employee and that the call\nwas shortly after her release.\n\n                                 8\n\n\n\na pregnancy test on March 21, and that the results of the\ntest were negative. Of course, a negative pr egnancy test on\nMarch 21 is consistent with Whetzel impr egnating Beers-\nCapitol about a week or so before her r elease on March 30.\nAccording to her deposition, Beers-Capitol did not want her\nboyfriend at the time of her release (now her husband) to\nfind out that Whetzel had impregnated her , so she had sex\nwith her boyfriend soon following her release. Nine months\nlater, she gave birth to a son, whom she and her husband\nhave raised as their child. Although Beers-Capitol has\nnever had a paternity test done, she seems to be convinced\nthat Whetzel is her son's biological father.\n\nB. The Abuse Suffered by T ate\n\nAliya Tate was incarcerated at YDC fr om June 13, 1991\nthrough May 4, 1993 and from July 12, 1994 to March 28,\n1995. In November 1994, when she was 16, Tate was in a\ncounseling session with Whetzel in Whetzel's back office\ndiscussing Tate's past sexual abuse, wher eupon Whetzel\nbegan to rub Tate's leg and lower thigh. On several other\noccasions in November and December 1994 and January\n1995 Whetzel attempted to kiss Tate and touch her\ngenitals. On the night of December 12, Whetzel tried to\ntouch Tate inappropriately while they wer e alone in Unit 7's\nTV room, but Tate immediately left the r oom. At around\nthis time, two other students reported (falsely, according to\nTate) that Tate and Whetzel had had sex in the TV room on\nDecember 12. This allegation was reported to Liggett, who\nassigned Robert McLean to investigate. Tate testified that\nWhetzel threatened that he would lengthen her stay at YDC\nif she told anyone what he had done, so Tate gave McLean\n\fa sworn statement that nothing had occurr ed between her\nand Whetzel.\n\nFinally, on January 29, 1995 Whetzel corner ed Tate in\nthe back office at the unit, prevented her fr om leaving,\ngrabbed her, kissed her, put his hands down her pants and\nthen tried to pick her up and lick her chest. After this\nincident, Tate wrote up a Student Incident Report (SIR)\ncomplaining of Whetzel's behavior that evening along with\nthe previous incidents and gave it to the duty officer. The\nduty officer then notified Earnhart of the allegation. The\nnext day, Tate talked to Nora Burley about the previous\n\n                               9\n\n\n\nday's incident as well as all the past incidents with Whetzel,\nat which time, according to Tate's deposition, Burley said to\nher that \"she kind of knew he was messing with students\nbut she didn't know that he was messing with me.\"\n\nAs a result of Tate's filing of the SIR, Liggett instituted an\ninvestigation, and YDC notified Child Line. Child Line in\nturn notified the Pennsylvania State Police which initiated\nits own investigation into Whetzel's conduct, eventually\nresulting in Whetzel's criminal conviction. In the course of\ntheir investigation the police found two other for mer\nresidents of YDC who had been sexually assaulted by\nWhetzel: Melissa Guyaux and Tina McAfee.\n\nC. Relevant Abuse of Other Residents\n\nMelissa Guyaux was at YDC from August 1992 to July\n1993. Guyaux testified at Whetzel's criminal trial that she\nhad had sex with Whetzel on many occasions during her\ntime at YDC. Guyaux stated that Whetzel often came into\nher room in the middle of the night, took her to the\ncanteen, and even took her out of school in the middle of\nthe day to have sex with her. In March 1993 it came to\nNora Burley's attention that another YDC resident alleged\nthat Whetzel and Guyaux were having sex. Burley set up a\nmeeting to investigate these allegations. Whetzel br ought\nGuyaux to the meeting and threatened her en r oute, saying\nthat he would extend her stay at YDC if she said anything.\nGuyaux thus denied having sex with Whetzel at the\nmeeting; Liggett was not notified of the allegation.\n\nTina McAfee was at YDC from May 1994 to February\n1995. During this time, Whetzel counseled McAfee about\nher previous sexual abuse as a child. At one session, while\nMcAffee was talking about past instances of rape and\nabuse, Whetzel asked her if it felt good and pointed to her\nvagina. Subsequently, Whetzel would wake McAfee in the\n\fmiddle of the night to have sex with her. On a couple of\noccasions, Flecher became aware of rumors that Whetzel\nwas having sex with McAfee (one of the times it was\nWhetzel himself who approached Flecher, expressing\n\"concern\" over these \"rumors\"). Flecher twice talked to\nMcAfee about these allegations, but she denied them both\ntimes. Flecher never informed Liggett about the allegations.\n\n                               10\n\n\n\nFinally, during his investigation of the reports that Tate\nand Whetzel had sex on Decemeber 12, 1994, investigator\nRobert McLean learned from Flecher that another female\nresident of YDC, Jochabed Good, had told a judge in mid-\n1994 that \"YDC was unsafe and `some staf f members at the\nYDC are having sex with students.' \" It is not clear from the\nrecord when Flecher became aware of Good's allegation, or\nwhat Flecher did in response.\n\nD. Procedural History\n\nThe plaintiffs brought suit in the District Court for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania under 42 U.S.C. S 1983,\nalleging that they were subjected to cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution because they were sexually\nassaulted by Whetzel while incarcerated at YDC. 5 All of the\ndefendants except Whetzel moved for summary judgment.\nIn deciding this motion, the District Court applied the two-\npart test from Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), for\nfinding an Eighth Amendment violation by a prison official:\n(1) a sufficiently serious constitutional deprivation; and (2)\ndeliberate indifference by the prison official-defendants.\n\nAs noted above, it is not disputed that the sexual abuse\nsuffered by the plaintiffs was sufficiently serious to support\nan Eighth Amendment claim, so the key issue in the case\nis whether the defendants exhibited deliberate indif ference\nto the plaintiffs' health or safety. The District Court granted\nthe defendants' motion for summary judgment, concluding\nthat the plaintiffs had not \"demonstrated a triable issue of\nfact as to whether any of the moving defendants wer e\ndeliberately indifferent to a substantial risk to [the]\nplaintiffs' rights.\" D. Ct. Mem. Op. at 8. This timely appeal\nfollowed. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. SS 1331 & 1343, and we have jurisdiction pursuant\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The plaintiffs also originally br ought claims under the Fourth, Ninth,\nand Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court r ejected these claims\nbecause it concluded that an Eighth Amendment analysis was the\nproper one to use for claims arising fr om incarceration in a facility for\n\fjuvenile offenders. See Dist. Ct. Mem. Op. at 7. The plaintiffs do not\npress these other claims on appeal.\n\n                                11\n\n\n\nto 28 U.S.C. S 1291. We set forth the familiar standard of\nreview of grants of summary judgment in the mar gin.6\n\nII. Discussion\n\nBecause this case turns on the plaintif fs' claims of\ndeliberate indifference, we begin our analysis with an\nexamination of the Supreme Court and Thir d Circuit\njurisprudence on deliberate indifference in the context of an\nEighth Amendment prison conditions claim. We then apply\nthis analytical structure to the plaintif fs' claims against\neach of the defendants.\n\nA. The Law on Deliberate Indiffer ence in a Prison\n       Conditions Case\n\n1.\n\nThe leading Supreme Court case setting forth the Eighth\nAmendment deliberate indifference analysis for a prison\nconditions case is Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994).\nIn Farmer, the Supreme Court r eversed a grant of summary\njudgment for various defendant prison officials on the\nplaintiff 's Eighth Amendment claim, which was based on\nthe deliberate indifference that the officials allegedly\nshowed to his risk of being sexually assaulted in prison. In\nits analysis on what type of showing is needed to establish\ndeliberate indifference by a defendant, Farmer rejected an\nobjective test for deliberate indiffer ence; instead it looked to\nwhat the prison official actually knew rather than what a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We exercise plenary review over a District Court's grant of summary\njudgment and review the facts in the light most favorable to the party\nagainst whom summary judgment was entered. See Pi Lambda Phi\nFraternity, Inc. v. University of Pittsburgh, 229 F.3d 435, 441 n.3 (3d\nCir.\n2000). Summary judgment is proper if ther e is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact and if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. See F.R.C.P. 56(c);Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986).\nAt the summary judgment stage, the judge's function is not to weigh the\nevidence and determine the truth of the matter , but to determine\nwhether there is a genuine issue for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986).\n\n                                12\n\freasonable official in his position should have known. More\nspecifically, the Court held that \"a prison official cannot be\nfound liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an\ninmate humane conditions of confinement unless the\nofficial knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate\nhealth or safety.\" Id. at 837.\n\nThis requirement of actual knowledge means that \"the\nofficial must both be aware of facts fr om which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\nharm exists, and he must also draw the infer ence.\" Id.\nFarmer explained, however, that this subjective knowledge\nrequirement does not mean that a prison official can avoid\nliability by remaining deliberately indif ferent to an excessive\nor substantial risk of serious harm to prisoners:\n\n       We are no more persuaded by petitioner's argument\n       that, without an objective test for deliberate\n       indifference, prison officials will be free to ignore\n       obvious dangers to inmates. Under the test we adopt\n       today, an Eighth Amendment claimant need not show\n       that a prison official acted or failed to act believing that\n       harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that\n       the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge\n       of a substantial risk of serious harm.\n\nId. at 842.\n\nMoreover, a defendant's knowledge of a risk can be\nproved indirectly by circumstantial evidence. \"[A] factfinder\nmay conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial\nrisk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.\" Id. (citing\nWayne R. LaFave & Austin W. Scott, Jr ., Substantive\nCriminal Law S 3.7, p. 335 (1986) (\"[I]f the risk is obvious,\nso that a reasonable man would realize it, we might well\ninfer that [the defendant] did in fact r ealize it. . . .\")). In\nfact, Farmer anticipated that a plaintiff could make out a\ndeliberate indifference case by showing that prison officials\nsimply were aware of a general risk to inmates in the\nplaintiff 's situation:\n\n       [I]f an Eighth Amendment plaintiff pr esents evidence\n       showing that a substantial risk of inmate attacks was\n       longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expr essly\n       noted by prison officials in the past, and the\n\n                               13\n\n\n\n       circumstances suggest that the defendant-official being\n\f       sued had been exposed to information concer ning the\n       risk and thus must have known about it, then such\n       evidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to\n       find that the defendant-official had actual knowledge of\n       the risk.\n\nId. at 842-43 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\nSimilarly, Farmer made clear that a prison official\ndefendant cannot escape liability by showing that he did\nnot know that this particular inmate was in danger of\nattack: \"it does not matter . . . whether a prisoner faces an\nexcessive risk of attack for reasons personal to him or\nbecause all prisoners in his situation face such a risk.\" Id.\nat 843.\n\nFarmer emphasized further that, while a prison official's\nknowledge of an excessive risk of serious har m may be\ninferred from the fact that the risk is obvious, this inference\nis not compelled, as the official always must have an\nopportunity to show that he was unaware of the risk. See\nid. at 844. Finally, the official who is actually aware of the\nrisk to the prisoner can avert liability by showing that he\nresponded reasonably to the risk, even if the ultimate harm\nwas not avoided. See id.\n\nThe Court in Farmer also discussed the showing that a\nplaintiff needs to make to survive a summary judgment\nmotion on a deliberate indifference claim. Although this\ndiscussion was in the context of a claim for an injunction,\nit may be applied to a claim for damages. The Court stated\nthat \"to survive summary judgment, [the plaintiff] must\ncome forward with evidence from which it can be inferred\nthat the defendant-officials were at the time suit was filed,\nand are at the time of summary judgment, knowingly and\nunreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of\nharm.\" Id. at 846. We r ead this discussion in Farmer to\nmean that, to defeat the summary judgment motion, Beers-\nCapitol and Tate must present enough evidence to support\nthe inference that the defendants \"knowingly and\nunreasonably disregarded an objectively intolerable risk of\nharm.\"\n\nOur decision in Hamilton v. Leavy, 117 F .3d 742 (3d Cir.\n1997), is instructive because it applies Far mer's deliberate\n\n                               14\n\n\n\nindifference test to a situation somewhat similar to the case\nat bar. In Hamilton, a prisoner br ought an Eighth\nAmendment deliberate indifference claim against certain\nprison officials, alleging that the officials were deliberately\nindifferent to the risk to his safety posed by other inmates\n\fwhen they transferred him to a certain Delawar e state\nprison. Plaintiff Hamilton had been attacked and seriously\ninjured by other inmates at this prison. The court granted\nsummary judgment for Lewis, the prison official who was in\ncharge of prisoner transfers, on the basis of Lewis's affidavit\nthat she did not know of any risk posed to Hamilton by the\ntransfer. The district court granted summary judgment to\nthe other defendants, who were members of the prison\nsystem's \"Multi-Disciplinary Team\" (MDT), because the\ncourt concluded that the MDT had acted reasonably and\n\"did everything they could\" after they lear ned of the risk to\nHamilton (the MDT had recommended that Hamilton be\nplaced in protective custody at the prison before he was\nattacked). Id. at 748. We reversed.\n\nFirst, we noted that Hamilton had presented sufficient\ncircumstantial evidence that Lewis was awar e of the risk\nposed to Hamilton to survive summary judgment: Lewis\nhad probably received the MDT recommendation (she did\nnot deny this); Lewis knew that Hamilton was a prison\ninformant and thus was more likely to be harmed by other\ninmates; and Lewis herself had approved pr otective custody\nfor Hamilton on two prior occasions. See id. at 747. We held\nthat this proffered evidence was similar to the type of\ncircumstantial evidence anticipated as sufficient by Farmer,\ni.e., it was sufficient evidence \"upon which a factfinder\ncould conclude that Lewis `must have known' of the risk to\nHamilton's safety.\" Id. at 748 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n842). Second, we reversed the grant of summary judgment\nfor the MDT defendants because Hamilton demonstrated\nthat there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether these\ndefendants could have done something more than merely\noffer a recommendation; for example, they could have\nplaced Hamilton in administrative segregation. We thus\nheld that \"there remains a genuine issue of material fact\nregarding whether the MDT's response to the risk Hamilton\nfaced was reasonable.\" Id.\n\n                               15\n\n\n\nFrom Farmer and Hamilton we extract the following\nprecepts. To be liable on a deliberate indifference claim, a\ndefendant prison official must both \"know[ ] of and\ndisregard[ ] an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\"\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837. The knowledge element of\ndeliberate indifference is subjective, not objective\nknowledge, meaning that the official must actually be aware\nof the existence of the excessive risk; it is not sufficient that\nthe official should have been aware. See id. at 837-38.\nHowever, subjective knowledge on the part of the official\ncan be proved by circumstantial evidence to the effect that\nthe excessive risk was so obvious that the official must\n\fhave known of the risk. See id. at 842. Finally, a defendant\ncan rebut a prima facie demonstration of deliberate\nindifference either by establishing that he did not have the\nrequisite level of knowledge or awareness of the risk, or\nthat, although he did know of the risk, he took r easonable\nsteps to prevent the harm from occurring. See id. at 844.\n\n2.\n\nThe plaintiffs' theory as to how the defendants' actions\nand inactions constitute deliberate indiffer ence proceeds\nalong two basic lines. First, the plaintiffs contend that some\nof the defendants knew of the abuse committed by Whetzel\nor were aware of the high risk of abuse, but declined to act\nor to seek more information about it. Second, the plaintiffs\nalso claim that the supervisor defendants, while per haps\nnot aware of the particular risk that Whetzel posed to these\nspecific plaintiffs, implemented policies that were so\ndefective that they created an unreasonable and excessive\nrisk of abuse to the female residents generally at YDC, and\nthat the defendants were aware of this risk.\n\nBoth of these approaches depend upon the thesis that all\nof the defendants were trained experts in the area of\njuvenile detention, so that, given what they knew, they\nmust have been aware of the excessive risks of harm to the\nplaintiffs that existed at YDC. In particular , the plaintiffs\ncontend that those defendants who were r esponsible for\nimplementing the policies at YDC had to know that the\npolicies and procedures at YDC created substantial general\nrisks of sexual abuse for the female residents there, as\n\n                               16\n\n\n\nthese defendants were trained how to minimize those risks.\nThe plaintiffs assert further that those defendants who\nworked directly with the female residents had to know of\nthe particular risk that Whetzel posed because they were\ntrained to recognize cases of sexual abuse and they were\naware of persistent allegations of his sexual r elationships\nwith the residents.\n\nThe deliberate indifference claims implicating supervisors\nfor their deficient policies are more complicated than the\nother, more direct deliberate indif ference claims, because\nthe former add another level to the analysis. Both the\nplaintiffs and the defendants argue that we should analyze\nthe supervisor-centered claims under the four-part test for\nsupervisor liability developed in Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d\n1099 (3d Cir. 1989).7 Sample involved a claim that a\nsupervisor was liable for a subordinate's Eighth\nAmendment violation because the supervisor implemented\n\fdeficient policies and was deliberately indif ferent to the risk\nthese policies generated. Although the claim in Sample does\nnot seem to be precisely the same as the plaintiffs' claim in\nthe case at bar--Sample concerned whether a supervisor\ncould be liable for a subordinate's Eighth Amendment tort\nwhile the plaintiffs here seem to claim that the supervisors\ncommitted their own Eighth Amendment violations by\nimplementing defective policies--we do not think this\ndifference material.\n\nIn Sample, the plaintiff (Sample) had his life sentence for\nmurder vacated by the Pennsylvania Supr eme Court, and\nwas granted bail pending the new trial. Although his family\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Although Sample was decided before Farmer, nothing in the Sample\nopinion that we rely on here conflicts with Farmer. Indeed, we have used\nparts of Sample's analysis of supervisor liability on a deliberate\nindifference claim in at least one case after Farmer. See Carter v. City\nof\nPhiladelphia, 181 F.3d 339, 356-357 & n.61 (3d Cir. 1999). District\ncourts in this circuit have also applied the Sample four-part test for\ndetermining supervisor liability on deliberate indifference claims after\nFarmer. See, e.g., Andrews v. Camden County, 95 F. Supp. 2d 217, 228-\n29 (D.N.J. 2000); Burch v. Reeves, 1999 WL 1285815 at *2-*3 (E.D. Pa.\nDec. 20, 1999); Carrigan v. Delaware, 957 F. Supp. 1376, 1382-83 (D.\nDel. 1997); Wagner v. Pennsylvania, 937 F. Supp. 510, 516 (W.D. Pa.\n1995).\n\n                               17\n\n\n\nwas ready to post bail, the senior recor ds officer (Diecks)\ndetermined that Sample still had time to serve on another\nsentence. In fact, Diecks was mistaken, and by the time\nthis mistake was rectified, Sample had served an additional\nnine months. Sample sued Diecks and William Robinson,\nthe Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Bureau of\nCorrections. Diecks was found liable for an Eighth\nAmendment violation for his deliberate indif ference. The\napposite precedent concerns the question whether\nRobinson was liable on the Eighth Amendment claim, as\nDiecks' supervisor, for failing to pr operly supervise and\nimplement policies and practices that would have pr otected\nagainst the constitutional violation.\n\nPresented with these facts, we developed a four -part test,\nbased on the Supreme Court's reasoning in City of Canton\nv. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989), for supervisor liability on an\nEighth Amendment claim for failure to pr operly supervise.\nUnder this regime, to hold a supervisor liable because his\npolicies or practices led to an Eighth Amendment violation,\nthe plaintiff must identify a specific policy or practice that\n\fthe supervisor failed to employ and show that: (1) the\nexisting policy or practice created an unr easonable risk of\nthe Eighth Amendment injury; (2) the supervisor was aware\nthat the unreasonable risk was created; (3) the supervisor\nwas indifferent to that risk; and (4) the injury resulted from\nthe policy or practice. See Sample, 885 F .2d at 1118.\n\nAccording to Sample, one way--per haps the easiest way--\na plaintiff can make out a supervisor liability claim is by\nshowing that \"the supervisory official failed to respond\nappropriately in the face of an awareness of a pattern of\nsuch injuries.\" Id. But that is not the only way to make out\nsuch a claim, as \"there are situations in which the risk of\nconstitutionally cognizable harm is so gr eat and so obvious\nthat the risk and the failure of supervisory officials to\nrespond will alone support findings of the existence of an\nunreasonable risk, of knowledge of that unr easonable risk,\nand of indifference to it.\" Id.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Stoneking v. Bradford Area School District, 882 F.2d 720 (3d Cir.\n1989), used a test similar to Sample's in considering a claim made under\nthe second method of showing deliberate indif ference (existence of \"so\n\n                               18\n\n\n\nIn sum, to make out a claim of deliberate indif ference\nbased on direct liability (i.e., insofar as the defendants are\nalleged to have known of and ignored the particular risk\nthat Whetzel posed), the plaintiffs must meet the test from\nFarmer v. Brennan: They must show that the defendants\nknew or were aware of and disregar ded an excessive risk to\nthe plaintiffs' health or safety, and they can show this by\nestablishing that the risk was obvious. For the plaintiffs'\nclaims seeking to hold supervisors liable for their deficient\npolicies, Sample's four-part test pr ovides the analytical\nstructure for determining whether the policymakers\nexhibited deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' risk of\ninjury, it being simply the deliberate indif ference test\napplied to the specific situation of a policymaker .\n\nB. The Allegations Against the Defendants: Applying The\n       Test\n\n1. Robert Liggett, Executive Director of YDC\n\nAs the Executive Director of YDC, Liggett has ultimate\nresponsibility for the overall operation of YDC. His duties\ninclude managing YDC's daily operation, supervising and\ntraining the staff, and formulating and implementing all\noperational policies, regulations, and practices. The\nplaintiffs concede that Liggett did not have actual\n\fknowledge of Whetzel's abuse of the plaintif fs, nor of the\nspecific risk that Whetzel posed to the plaintif fs, until after\nthe fact. Instead, the plaintiffs level a claim of supervisor\nliability against Liggett, contending that the policies and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ngreat and so obvious\" a risk). In Stoneking, the plaintiff, a student in\nthe\nBradford school district, sought to hold the school district and its\nofficials liable for a teacher's sexual assault on her, on the theory that\nthe school district and officials maintained a practice, custom, or policy\nof deliberate indifference to instances of known or suspected sexual\nabuse by teachers. Stoneking, like Sample, followed the reasoning of City\nof Canton, and held that \"if the need for mor e or different training is\nso\nobvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of\nconstitutional rights, `the policymakers . . . can reasonably be said to\nhave been deliberately indifferent to the need.' \" Id. at 725 (quoting\nCity\nof Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390 (1989)).\n\n                                19\n\n\n\nprocedures that Liggett implemented and approved created\nan unreasonably unsafe environment at YDC that allowed\nWhetzel to commit his abuse over an extended period, and\nthat Liggett knew that his policies were deficient in this\nway.\n\nThe plaintiffs' allegations of Liggett's policymaking\ninadequacies fall into three categories: (1) the failure to\nfollow accepted standards for the basic structure and\nstaffing of juvenile residential facilities; (2) the failure to\nproperly train staff to recognize child abuse; and (3) the\npromulgation of de facto policies and the failure to\nimplement other policies, ultimately leading to the stifling of\ncomplaints of abuse and incompetent investigations of the\ncomplaints that were made. The plaintif fs' expert, John\nCocoros (a consultant with extensive experience in the field\nof residential facilities for delinquent youths), opined in a\nwritten report prepared for the plaintiffs that these\ndeficiencies created a situation in which YDC failed to have\n\"basic precepts of institutional management without which\nno administrator can claim to operate a facility which\nprovides safety and security for its staf f and residents,\"\nthus \"unnecessarily plac[ing] juveniles at high risk for\nabuse at the hands of staff \" and \"cr eating an environment\nin which eventual abuse was virtually predictable.\"\n\nRegarding the first area of allegedly deficient\npolicymaking by Liggett, the plaintiffs point to five\ninadequacies with the basic structure of YDC: (1) YDC did\n\fnot require that a female staff member be present at all\ntimes in the female units, in contravention of the American\nCorrectional Association's Standards for Juvenile Training\nSchools No. 3-JTS-3A-07; (2) there was poor or nonexistent\nsupervision of the staff at night (when Whetzel committed\nmany of his abuses); (3) YDC had no observation or\nsurveillance system (thus ensuring that Whetzel could take\nfemale residents to areas where they would be unobserved);\n(4) YDC permitted private, unsupervised interactions\nbetween male staff and female residents; and (5) YDC\npermitted unsupervised trips off-gr ounds by female\nresidents solely accompanied by male staf f.\n\nWith respect to the failure of staf f training, the plaintiffs\ncontend that, despite rules that requir ed and staff training\n\n                               20\n\n\n\nthat emphasized that all allegations of abuse be r eported,\nLiggett allowed staff members to decide on their own\nwhether to report an allegation. Because the allegations\nagainst Whetzel were reported to dif ferent staff members,\nmany of whom did not report those allegations to Liggett,\nno one person knew the extent of the allegations against\nWhetzel. In their brief, the plaintiffs list seven different\nemployees who were aware of differ ent allegations against\nWhetzel but who did not report these allegations to Liggett.\nSee Pls.' Br. at 24 n.8. The plaintif fs argue that Liggett's\nfailure to have any sort of review pr ocedure in place to\ndetermine whether the notification policy was being\nfollowed, along with his failure to discipline these\nemployees after this information came out or to train them\nproperly in the first place, were serious policy deficiencies\nthat, according to Cocoros, led to the cr eation of a staff\nsubculture in which a staff member's abuses could go\nunaddressed.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs assert that Liggett's policies failed to\nprovide the juveniles under his care with multiple and\neasily accessible opportunities for them to r eport abuse.\nThey contend that any reports of abuse that wer e made\nwere incompetently investigated under Liggett's overall\nsupervision. According to the plaintiffs, Liggett's policies\nallowed his staff to respond to initial allegations with\nthreats (Robinson, Whetzel) and confrontation (Earnhart).\nWhen a report did reach Liggett, he is alleged either to have\nfailed to initiate an investigation (as with Jocheded Good's\nallegation),9 or to have initiated inadequate investigations\n(as with the two Tate allegations, both of which were\ndetermined by YDC to be unfounded although the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f9. At one point in their brief, the plaintif fs claim that Liggett knew\nabout\nGood's allegation, but in another section they assert that Flecher failed\nto notify Liggett of Good's allegation. See Pls.' Br. at 24, 32. The\nimplication of the plaintiffs' claim that Flecher did not inform Liggett\nof\nthe allegation is that Flecher knew of the allegation but Liggett did not;\nthus, the plaintiffs' claims here may be inconsistent. Because we must\ndraw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party in a review of a\nsummary judgment motion, we conclude for the purposes of this appeal\nthat Flecher did not inform Liggett of Good's allegation but that Liggett\nlearned of it through some other means.\n\n                               21\n\n\n\nPennsylvania state police determined them to be true in its\ninvestigation).\n\nBecause we are reviewing the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment, we take the above allegations to be\ntrue and we must now consider whether they ar e legally\nsufficient to support a claim of deliberate indif ference past\nthe summary judgment stage. More specifically, the\nrelevant issue is whether the above-described policymaking\ninadequacies raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether the four-part test for deliberate indifference from\nSample is met. As we noted above, Sample provides two\nmethods of meeting this test: (i) showing that the\nsupervisor failed to adequately respond to a pattern of past\noccurrences of injuries like the plaintif fs', or (ii) showing\nthat the risk of constitutionally cognizable har m was \"so\ngreat and so obvious that the risk and the failure of\nsupervisory officials to respond will alone\" support finding\nthat the four-part test is met. Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d\n1099, 1118 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs have not met their burden\nof showing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether Liggett exhibited deliberate indif ference in his\npolicymaking. Considering the first method of meeting the\nSample test, the plaintiffs have not shown that Liggett was\naware of a \"pattern\" of sexual assaults being committed by\nYDC employees. See id. At most, they have alleged that\nLiggett was aware of Good's allegation and that he was\naware of two allegations regarding T ate. Such knowledge\ncannot benefit Beers-Capitol in her claim against Liggett\nbecause the behavior described in the allegations occurred\nafter her abuse, and a successful deliberate indif ference\nclaim requires showing that the defendant knew of the risk\nto the plaintiff before the plaintiff 's injury occurred. See\nLewis v. Richards, 107 F.3d 549, 553 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(holding that a plaintiff cannot make out a deliberate\n\findifference claim against prison officials for a prison attack\nwhen the plaintiff presented evidence that the defendants\nknew of the attack afterwards but presented no evidence\nthat defendants knew of the risk to the defendant before\nthe attack). Because Whetzel's abuse of Beers-Capitol\noccurred approximately eight months befor e Whetzel's\n\n                               22\n\n\n\nabuse of Tate, some evidence of the defendants' awareness\nof Whetzel's activities is available to Tate but not Beers-\nCapitol.\n\nTate could argue that Liggett knew of Good's allegation\nand her first allegation before her final abuse had occurred,\nbut we do not believe that two allegations constitute a\n\"pattern of past occurrences\" as contemplated by Sample.\nFurthermore, even if two instances is a pattern, this is not\na pattern of known injuries, but a pattern of known\nallegations, which is quite differ ent; they are known to be\ninjuries now, but it is what Liggett knew at the time, not\nwhat he knows now, that is material.\n\nThe plaintiffs concentrate their argument on the second\nmethod of meeting the Sample test--the existence of \"so\ngreat and so obvious\" a risk, which is alleged to have arisen\nas a result of deficient policies and practices that were in\nplace before the attacks on Beers-Capitol. T o make their\nargument, the plaintiffs point to Cocor os's conclusion that\nYDC's administration showed \"reckless disr egard for the\nsafety of residents.\" This conclusion is suf fused with legal\nconsiderations, and it is our province to deter mine whether\nthe factual conclusions in Cocoros's report support the\nlegal conclusion of deliberate indiffer ence. The report shows\nthat YDC did not implement a number of policies that were\nstandard or recommended in the juvenile detention field,\nand that YDC's policies and procedures could have been\nbetter. We note in passing that the r eport, if accurate, is an\nindictment of the administration of the YDC by Liggett and\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfar e. Most\nimportantly, the plaintiffs argue for cefully that Liggett's\npolicymaking created an \"institutional mindset\" that\nallowed Whetzel's abuse to go on for as long as it did.\n\nThe deliberate indifference standar d as set out in Farmer\nis a high one, however--requiring actual knowledge or\nawareness on the part of the defendant--and the plaintiffs'\nevidence here is not sufficient to cr eate a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether the above policies and practices\ncreated a risk of harm to the plaintif fs that was \"so great\nand so obvious\" that Liggett must have known of the\nexcessive risk but was indifferent to it. Although Cocoros's\n\freport does seem to raise a genuine issue as to Liggett's\n\n                               23\n\n\n\nnegligence, it is not \"evidence from which it can be inferred\"\nthat Liggett \"knowingly and unreasonably disregard[ed] an\nobjectively intolerable risk of harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n846; see also Steele v. Choi, 82 F.3d 175, 179 (7th Cir.\n1996) (holding that evidence that a minimally competent\ndoctor would have treated the plaintiff prisoner correctly\nwhile the defendant doctor did not is insufficient under\nFarmer to survive the defendant's motion for summary\njudgment in a deliberate indifference case).\n\nAs we have explained, using circumstantial evidence to\nprove deliberate indifference r equires more than evidence\nthat the defendants should have recognized the excessive\nrisk and responded to it; it requir es evidence that the\ndefendant must have recognized the excessive risk and\nignored it. The plaintiff 's evidence may raise an issue of\nmaterial fact as to the former but it does not for the latter.\nWe therefore will affirm the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment for Liggett.\n\n2. Charles Earnhart, Director of Unit 7\n\nEarnhart was the unit director of Unit 7 during the\nrelevant time period, responsible for the day-to-day\noperations of Unit 7, which included supervising the staff of\nthe unit and reviewing and evaluating r eports and\nscheduled work. Earnhart directly supervised the unit\nmanagers, meeting with these managers daily.\n\nThe plaintiffs' deliberate indiffer ence claims against\nEarnhart involve a combination of direct and supervisor\nliability. First, the plaintiffs assert that Earnhart\nparticipated in formulating and implementing the policy\nthat allowed the night shift in the female r esidents' unit to\nbe without a female staff member, as well as the policy\npermitting unsupervised male staff to take female residents\noff-grounds. The analysis of this claim of deliberate\nindifference proceeds along the same lines as outlined\nabove for Liggett (with the four-part test fr om Sample), but\nthis supervisory-based claim is weaker than the one against\nLiggett that we rejected above. As to whether Earnhart was\naware of a pattern of past injuries, the facts as alleged only\nsupport the conclusion that he knew of Beers-Capitol's\n\n                               24\n\fallegation, and one incident does not a patter n make. As to\nthe \"so great and so obvious a risk\" method of meeting\nSample's test, the analysis begins and ends just as it did\nfor Liggett. In fact, because Earnhart's supervisory\nresponsibility at YDC was not as great as Liggett's, there is\nless evidence that Earnhart's policies cr eated a risk that\nwas \"so great and so obvious\" that he must have known of\nthe excessive risk but was indifferent to it. For these\nreasons, the plaintiffs' claims of deliberate indifference\nagainst Earnhart based on supervisor liability cannot\nsurvive summary judgment.\n\nThe plaintiffs also submit that Earnhart directly\nexhibited deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' injuries\nthrough two other actions: (1) by failing to discipline\nRobinson for delaying her reporting of Beers-Capitol's\nallegation of abuse; and (2) by mishandling Beers-Capitol's\nallegation, in that (a) Earnhart did not r eport it to Liggett\n(as required by law); and (b) Earnhart \"undertook a wholly\ninadequate investigation,\" namely, merely calling Beers-\nCapitol at home and asking her over the phone if the abuse\noccurred.10\n\nWe note first that Beers-Capitol cannot use the above two\nactions to support her claim that Earnhart was aware of\nthe risk of abuse to her because these actions took place\nafter Beers-Capitol's abuse. In the absence of any other\nevidence that Earnhart was aware of an excessive risk to\nBeers-Capitol, Beers-Capitol cannot make out a dir ect\ndeliberate indifference claim against Ear nhart. See Lewis v.\nRichards, 107 F.3d 549, 553 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\nHowever, Tate can claim that Ear nhart's actions\nsurrounding Beers-Capitol's abuse (which occurr ed before\nthe abuse Tate suffered) ar e evidence that, by the time of\nTate's abuse, Earnhart was aware of but ignored the\nexcessive risk to the female residents posed by Whetzel. We\nnonetheless conclude that this evidence is insufficient to\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nEarnhart was deliberately indiffer ent. It is not apparent\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Although it is unclear from the r ecord whether Earnhart called\nBeers-Capitol himself or had Flecher call Beers-Capitol, see supra page\n8 & note 4, this does not affect our analysis.\n\n                               25\n\n\n\nhow Earnhart's failure to discipline Robinson for her brief\ndelay in reporting Beers-Capitol's allegation demonstrates\nthat Earnhart was deliberately indiffer ent to a risk to Tate.\nFurthermore, although Earnhart pr obably should have\n\fbetter handled the investigation into Beers-Capitol's\nallegation, this lapse is not nearly enough to clear the high\nbar set by Farmer: raising an infer ence that he \"knowingly\nand unreasonably disregard[ed] an objectively intolerable\nrisk of harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 846. We therefore will\naffirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment for\nEarnhart.\n\n3. Joseph Flecher, Manager of Unit 7\n\nFlecher was the unit manager for Unit 7 during the\nrelevant time period. Unit managers are r esponsible for\ndeveloping, coordinating, and administering pr ogram\nservices for their unit; they also directly supervise the\ncottage supervisors within their unit. As with Ear nhart, the\nplaintiffs' claims of Flecher's deliberate indifference\ncombine direct and supervisor liability. First, the plaintiffs\nclaim that Flecher failed to adequately train the staff under\nhim to recognize abuse. Second (and relatedly), plaintiffs\nassert that Flecher carried out a de facto policy of failing to\nnotify Liggett of allegations of abuse and of disbelieving\nsuch allegations when they were presented to him, because,\nas Flecher stated to Investigator McLean, \"these types of\naccusations occur on a frequent basis when female\nstudents become upset or angry with staff members.\" The\nplaintiffs also have presented evidence that supports a\nclaim of direct liability against Flecher , namely that, in the\ntime period before Tate's abuse but after Beers-Capitol's,\nFlecher had notice of, but did not adequately r espond to,\nWhetzel's abusive activities.11 The evidence is: (1) Flecher's\nfailure to notify Liggett of Beers-Capitol's allegations; (2)\nFlecher's failure to notify Liggett of Good's allegations; (3)\nFlecher's failure to notify Liggett of McAfee's allegations; (4)\nFlecher's failure to make any recor ding of McAfee's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. As above, this evidence only supports T ate's claim against Flecher,\nnot Beers-Capitol's, because all of these actions occurred after Beers-\nCapitol's abuse.\n\n                                26\n\n\n\nallegations; and (5) Flecher's failure to conduct adequate\ninvestigations of Beers-Capitol's, McAfee's, and Good's\nallegations.\n\nOf the three supervisor defendants (Liggett, Earnhart,\nand Flecher), Flecher appears to be the one who had the\nmost information about what was going on with Whetzel.\nFurthermore, because he was the manager of Unit 7,\nFlecher was in a position both to conduct investigations\ninto Whetzel's behavior and to inform Liggett of any\n\fproblems and allegations regarding Whetzel. The plaintiffs\nargue that the combination of Flecher's knowledge of the\nallegations against Whetzel, Flecher's failur e to follow YDC\nprocedures and Pennsylvania law in not notifying Liggett of\nthese allegations, and Flecher's own inadequate\ninvestigations of the allegations together cr eate a genuine\nissue of fact as to Flecher's deliberate indif ference.\nAlthough there is no direct evidence that Flecher was aware\nof Whetzel's activities, the plaintiffs contend that Flecher\nhad heard enough allegations against Whetzel and knew\nenough about the inadequate system for addressing those\nallegations that he must have known of the excessive risk\nof harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nWhile this issue is a close one, we conclude that the\nplaintiffs' evidence does not create a genuine issue of fact\nas to Flecher's deliberate indifference. The plaintiffs have\nprovided evidence that Flecher was awar e of three\nallegations of abuse by Whetzel, but there is no evidence\nthat Flecher believed that these allegations wer e likely to be\ntrue, or that the evidence surrounding the allegations was\nso strong that he must have believed them likely to be true.\nIn fact, the plaintiffs have presented evidence that Flecher\ndisbelieved the allegations: his statement to McLean that\n\"these types of accusations occur on a fr equent basis when\nfemale students become upset or angry with staf f\nmembers.\" See supra note 3. This statement is illuminating\nof Flecher's subjective mindset of basic skepticism\nregarding the allegations raised by the female YDC\nresidents; although this mindset does not comport well with\nYDC's official policies and Pennsylvania law, it is also\ninconsistent with the subjective knowledge of a risk\nrequired for deliberate indiffer ence under Farmer.\n\n                               27\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs here have failed to pr esent the kind of\nevidence that successful plaintiffs have pr esented in\ndeliberate indifference cases after Farmer: evidence that\ndirectly shows that Flecher either knew of the excessive risk\nto the plaintiffs or was aware of such overwhelming\nevidence that he had to know of such a risk. The case is\nthus different from Hamilton v. Leavy, 117 F.3d 742 (3d\nCir. 1997), where we reversed the grant of summary\njudgment in a deliberate indifference case for a prison\nofficial defendant who was in charge of prison transfers.\nThe plaintiff in Hamilton presented evidence that, before the\nattack, the defendant had received a recommendation that\nthe plaintiff be placed in protective custody because of his\nrisk of being attacked, the defendant knew that the plaintiff\nwas more likely to be attacked because he was a prison\ninformant, and the defendant had approved putting the\n\fplaintiff in protective custody on two pr evious occasions.12\nThe plaintiffs' evidence against Flecher falls well below this\nlevel.\n\nFlecher investigated McAfee's allegation, and either he or\nEarnhart investigated Beers-Capitol's allegation (the record\nis not clear what happened with Good's allegation).\nAlthough these investigations may have been inadequate,\nwe do not review the adequacy of a defendant's response to\nan excessive risk to inmate safety in a deliberate\nindifference case until the plaintif f has established that the\ndefendant knew or was aware of that risk. See Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 844. The performance of a less-than-thorough\ninvestigation of a risk does not show that the investigator\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. See also Spruce v. Sargent, 149F.3d 783 (8th Cir. 1998) (reversing\ndistrict court's judgment as a matter of law for one defendant in a\ndeliberate indifference case because the plaintiff-prisoner presented\ndocuments signed by that defendant which contained numerous\nreferences to sexual attacks the plaintif f was suffering, but affirming\njudgment for another defendant because the plaintif f did not present\nsimilar evidence as to that defendant); Pavlick v. Mifflin, 90 F.3d 205\n(7th\nCir. 1996) (affirming entry of judgment for the plaintiff-prisoner in\ndeliberate indifference case because the plaintiff presented evidence\nthat,\nmoments before he was attacked while sleeping in his cell by prison gang\nmembers who had a grudge against him, the defendant, a prison guard,\nwas outside plaintiff 's cell talking with these gang members, and then\nthe defendant unlocked the door to plaintiff 's cell and walked away).\n\n                               28\n\n\n\nbelieved that the excessive risk existed--indeed, it may\nshow the opposite. Finally, Flecher's failur e to notify Liggett\nof these allegations is evidence of negligence in the\nperformance of his job, but it does nothing to support the\nclaim that he knew or must have known of the excessive\nrisk to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe most that the plaintiffs show is that Flecher followed\na set of de facto rules and policies that involved his\ndeciding on his own whether and how to investigate certain\nallegations of abuse, in violation of YDC policy and\nPennsylvania law. While this course of action was\nimprudent, and in fact led to a very regr ettable outcome, it\ndoes not constitute deliberate indiffer ence as the Supreme\nCourt defined that concept in Farmer. Moreover, the\nplaintiffs have presented no other evidence that shows that\nFlecher was subjectively aware of the excessive risk to the\nplaintiffs. The plaintiffs have thus failed to raise a genuine\n\fissue of fact as to the existence of deliberate indifference on\nthe part of Flecher, and we will affir m the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment in his favor.\n\n4. Nora Burley, Counselor in Unit 7\n\nBurley worked in Unit 7 as a counselor; her job was to\nprovide security in the unit and monitor r esident\ninteractions. The plaintiffs' deliberate indif ference claims\nagainst Burley center solely on direct liability, as Burley\nwas not a supervisor. The plaintiffs pr esent fairly\nsubstantial evidence of Burley's knowledge or awar eness of\nthe excessive risk that Whetzel posed to the female\nresidents. Burley testified in a deposition that, while she\nwas at YDC, she had heard general rumors fr om the\nresidents that Whetzel was having sex with some of the\nfemale residents, but she did not investigate these rumors\nor report them to her supervisors. She did, however, make\nfile notes of these rumors \"[t]o cover my behind, in case it\nwere true.\"\n\nBurley was also told on a couple of occasions that\nGuyaux claimed to have a sexual relationship with Whetzel.\nBurley did not inform her supervisors of this allegation, but\ninstead set up a meeting with Whetzel, Guyaux, and\n\n                               29\n\n\n\nanother counselor to ask Guyaux about it.13 Burley also\ntestified that she knew McAfee had a sexual inter est in\nWhetzel, although she did not report or investigate this.\nFinally, and most tellingly, Tate testified in her deposition\nthat Burley admitted to her that \"she kind of knew that\n[Whetzel] was messing with students\" when T ate told\nBurley of Whetzel's assault on her.14 [1532a, Tate Dep.]\n\nWe are satisfied that the plaintif fs have presented\nsufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact\nas to Burley's deliberate indifference to the excessive risk\nWhetzel posed to the plaintiffs. Burley's statement to Tate\nthat she \"kind of knew\" that Whetzel was \"messing\" with\nstudents is significant evidence that Burley was\"aware of\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed]\" and that she\n\"also dr[ew] the inference.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. The\nother evidence about what Burley knew strengthens this\nconclusion. Moreover, the fact that Burley said to Tate that\nshe did not know that Whetzel was \"messing\" with Tate in\nparticular does not constitute a defense to a deliberate\nindifference claim; Farmer is clear that a defendant need\nnot know that the particular inmate attacked was at risk,\nas it is enough for deliberate indiffer ence if a defendant\n\fknows that inmates in the plaintiff 's situation face such a\nrisk. See id. at 843-44.\n\nFor the purposes of reviewing a grant of summary\njudgment for the defendants, Burley basically admitted that\nshe had knowledge of Whetzel's abusive activities by the\ntime of Tate's abuse in her statement to T ate. The difficulty\nfor Beers-Capitol is that this admission was made in\nJanuary 1995, approximately ten months after Beers-\nCapitol was abused, and Beers-Capitol must show that\nBurley knew of the risk Whetzel posed before he abused\nBeers-Capitol. See Lewis v. Richards, 107 F.3d 549, 553\n(7th Cir. 1997). However, even though the abuse of Beers-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. This was the meeting to which Whetzel br ought Guyaux, threatening\nher en route.\n\n14. Tate's recounting of Burley's comment is admissible evidence\nbecause, as an admission by a party-opponent, it is not hearsay under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).\n\n                               30\n\n\n\nCapitol occurred before Burley made her admission to Tate,\nwe think that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs raises\na genuine issue of fact as to what Burley was awar e of\nregarding Whetzel at the time Beers-Capitol was abused.\n\nBurley's awareness of Whetzel's activities had to have\nbeen based upon some information she r eceived before she\nmade her admission to Tate in January 1995. Burley\nadmitted in her deposition that, during her time at YDC,\nshe heard various rumors that Whetzel was having sex with\nfemale residents, and she made file notes of these rumors,\n\"[t]o cover my behind, in case it wer e true.\" Because we\ndraw all inferences in the non-movant's favor in our review\nof a summary judgment motion, we conclude that these\nrumors formed at least part of the basis for her awareness\nof Whetzel's activities. Burley had started to hear these\nrumors at least by March 1993 (a full year before Beers-\nCapitol was abused), when she set up a meeting with\nWhetzel and Melissa Guyaux to investigate rumors that\nWhetzel and Guyaux were having sex. Thus, Beers-Capitol\nhas shown that Burley received at least some of the\ninformation that formed the basis for her awareness before\nBeers-Capitol was abused.\n\nThe short of it is that, drawing all inferences in Beers-\nCapitol's favor, it is possible that Burley r eceived enough\ninformation about Whetzel's activities that she formed her\nawareness of these activities by March 1994, when Beers-\n\fCaitol was abused. This creates a genuine issue of fact as\nto what Burley knew when, and the evidence pr esented\ncould support a conclusion by the factfinder that Burley's\nawareness arose before March 1994. Under this\ncircumstance, the evidence presented r egarding Burley is\nsufficient to get both Tate and Beers-Capitol past summary\njudgment. We will thus reverse the grant of summary\njudgment for Burley on both plaintiffs' claims.15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. As we noted earlier, the defendants also assert qualified immunity;\nthe District Court did not reach this issue because it granted summary\njudgment to the defendants on the merits. While it is not necessary for\nus to decide this claim as to the other defendants because we will affirm\nthe summary judgment grants for them, it is a live issue as it relates to\nBurley. The qualified immunity argument fails, however, because, to the\n\n                               31\n\n\n\n5. Shirley Robinson, Youth Development Aide in Unit 7\n\nAs a youth development aide, Robinson perfor med a role\nthat was similar to a YDC counselor's: providing security in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nextent that the plaintiffs have made a showing sufficient to overcome\nsummary judgment on the merits, they have also made a showing\nsufficient to overcome any claim to qualified immunity.\n\nUnder the doctrine of qualified immunity, \"government officials\nperforming discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability\nfor civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\nperson would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818,\n(1982). It is the defendants' burden to establish that they are entitled\nto\nsuch immunity. See Stoneking v. Bradford Area Sch. Dist., 882 F.2d 720,\n726 (3d Cir. 1989). That is, the defendants must show that their conduct\ndid not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\"The contours of the right\nmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\nthat what he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. 635, 640 (1987). Unlike Farmer's subjective test of what the prison\nofficial knew, the test for qualified immunity is objective. \"Under the\ntest\nannounced in Harlow, reasonableness is measured by an objective\nstandard; arguments that the defendants desired to handle or\nsubjectively believed that they had handled the incidents properly are\nirrelevant.\" Stoneking, 882 F.2d at 726 (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. at 641). That is, Burley is entitled to qualified immunity only if\nshe\ncan show that a reasonable person in her position at the relevant time\n\fcould have believed, in light of clearly established law, that her conduct\ncomported with established legal standards. See id.\n\nThere is no question that the plaintiffs' constitutional right that was\nviolated--the right not to be sexually abused by a state employee while\nin confinement--was clearly established at the time of Burley's relevant\nactions. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833-34; Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97,\n102-03 (1976); Stoneking, 882 F.3d at 726. The doctrine of deliberate\nindifference was also clearly established at the relevant time. See\nEstelle,\n429 U.S. at 104-05. The key issue for our purposes is whether Burley's\nrelevant conduct was objectively reasonable, or, more specifically,\nwhether a reasonable YDC worker in her situation could have believed\nthat her conduct comported with established legal standards, i.e., she\nwas not being deliberately indifferent to the existence of an excessive\nrisk to the plaintiffs (either because she thought that there was no\nexcessive risk or because she thought that her r esponse was adequate).\nWe have determined, however, that the plaintiffs have raised a genuine\n\n                               32\n\n\n\nthe units and monitoring resident interactions. As with\nBurley, the plaintiffs' claims against Robinson involve only\ndirect liability. The plaintiffs pr offer the following two acts\nas evidence of Robinson's deliberate indiffer ence: (1) when\nBeers-Capitol told Robinson that Whetzel impr egnated her,\nRobinson's first response was to say, \"W ell, you know you\ncan get in trouble making accusations like that,\"; and (2)\nRobinson delayed reporting Beers-Capitol's allegation to her\nsupervisor (although it is unclear from the r ecord exactly\nhow long this delay was, as Robinson's and Ear nhart's\ntestimony differ on this point). Because these actions by\nRobinson occurred after Beers-Capitol's abuse, and the\nplaintiffs present no evidence regar ding Robinson's\nawareness of Whetzel's activities befor e that abuse, Beers-\nCapitol has presented no evidence to support her deliberate\nindifference claim against Robinson. See Lewis v. Richards,\n107 F.3d 549, 553 (7th Cir. 1997). T ate, however, has a\npotential direct deliberate indiffer ence claim against\nRobinson, as her abuse occurred after Robinson's actions,\nand Tate can argue that these actions ar e evidence that, by\nthe time of Tate's abuse, Robinson was awar e of the risk\nWhetzel posed to the female residents but was indifferent to\nthis risk.\n\nNevertheless, we conclude that the above-described\nevidence is an insufficient basis for inferring that Robinson\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Burley was deliberately indifferent.\nBecause deliberate indifference underFarmer requires actual knowledge\nor awareness on the part of the defendant, a defendant cannot have\n\fqualified immunity if she was deliberately indif ferent; a reasonable YDC\nworker could not believe that her actions comported with clearly\nestablished law while also believing that ther e is an excessive risk to\nthe\nplaintiffs and failing to adequately r espond to that risk. Conduct that\nis\ndeliberately indifferent to an excessive risk to YDC residents cannot be\nobjectively reasonable conduct. See Carter v. City of Philadelphia, 181\nF.3d 339, 356 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that, if the plaintiff succeeds in\nestablishing that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to\nconstitutional rights, then a fortiori the defendants' conduct was not\nobjectively reasonable, and hence the defense of qualified immunity\nwould not be available to defendants). Because ther e is a genuine issue\nof fact as to whether Burley was deliberately indif ferent, she has not\ncarried her burden to establish that she is entitled to such immunity.\nWe thus reject Burley's qualified immunity claim.\n\n                               33\n\n\n\n\"knowingly and unreasonably disregar d[ed] an objectively\nintolerable risk of harm.\" Farmer , 511 U.S. at 846. The\nplaintiffs' evidence contains only a single instance where\nRobinson was informed of an allegation against Whetzel.\nMoreover, she did report this allegation to her supervisor\n(albeit after a short delay). While Robinson's r esponse to the\nallegation--telling Beers-Capitol that \"you can get in trouble\nmaking allegations like that\"--was certainly inappropriate\ngiven her responsibilities as a youth development aide, this\nimpropriety is not enough to show deliberate indifference.\nFurthermore, Robinson did report the allegation to her\nsupervisor, which was a reasonable r esponse. Although\nRobinson delayed her report somewhat, this minor delay\nsurely had little or no effect on Whetzel's risk to Tate, who\nwas not yet at YDC at the time of Beers-Capitol's allegation.\n\nThe most that Tate can claim is that Robinson's original\nresponse to Beers-Capitol and her delay in r eporting the\nallegation made Beers-Capitol less likely to continue to\nmaintain her allegation when later questioned. As with\nFlecher, however, such evidence goes to the adequacy of\nRobinson's response to the risk, and we do not reach that\nquestion until we determine that there is a genuine issue of\nas to Robinson's awareness of the risk. One allegation,\nlater denied, is not sufficient evidence for us to infer that\nRobinson knew or must have known of the risk to T ate. We\ntherefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for\nRobinson.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affir m the District\nCourt's grant of summary judgment as to the defendants\n\fLiggett, Earnhart, Flecher, and Robinson, and reverse the\ngrant of summary judgment for Burley. The case will be\nremanded to the District Court for further pr oceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.

S 1983 civil rights\nlawsuit that they brought against various YDC employees\nand supervisors. During their time at YDC, the plaintiffs\nwere sexually assaulted by Barry Whetzel, a YDC employee\nwho was working as a youth development aide at the time\nhe committed the assaults. Whetzel was eventually\nconvicted of criminal charges arising out of these incidents.\nBeers-Capitol and Tate then brought a civil rights action\nalleging violations of their Eighth Amendment rights and\nnaming as defendants: Whetzel; three of his supervisors,\nRobert Liggett, the Executive Director of YDC, Charles\nEarnhart, a YDC director, and Joseph Flecher, a YDC\nmanager; and two of his co-workers, Nora Burley, a YDC\ncounselor, and Shirley Robinson, a YDC youth development\naide. After the District Court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of all of the other defendants, the plaintif fs won a\n\fjudgment of $200,000 against Whetzel.\n\nAn Eighth Amendment claim against a prison official\nmust meet two requirements: (1) \"the deprivation alleged\nmust be, objectively, sufficiently serious;\" and (2) the\n\"prison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind.\" Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (1994)\n(quotation marks and citations omitted). In prison\nconditions cases, \"that state of mind is one of`deliberate\nindifference' to inmate health or safety.\" Id. \"Deliberate\nindifference\" is a subjective standar d under Farmer--the\nprison official-defendant must actually have known or been\naware of the excessive risk to inmate safety. The parties\nagree that the sexual assaults against Beers-Capitol and\nTate were sufficiently serious, so the determinative issue in\nthis case is whether the defendants' actions and inaction\nrose to the level of deliberate indiffer ence. Depending on the\nroles and responsibilities of the r espective defendants, the\nplaintiffs have set forth two bases for their claims of\ndeliberate indifference. With r espect to the defendants who\nare alleged to have had notice that Whetzel was having sex\nwith one or more of the female residents at YDC, the\nplaintiffs assert that these defendants took inadequate (or\nno) measures in response to this notice. W ith respect to the\ndefendants who are not alleged to have had knowledge of\nthe specific risk that Whetzel posed, the plaintif fs claim\nthat these defendants either implemented or failed to\n\n                                3\n\n\n\nimplement YDC policies that created a situation in which\nan employee like Whetzel would be able to sexually assault\nfemale residents at YDC without being discover ed for some\ntime, and that these defendants were awar e that such\npolicies created this risk but ignored it.\n\nWe will affirm the District Court's grant of summary\njudgment for defendants Liggett, Earnhart, Flecher, and\nRobinson, because the evidence that the plaintif fs proffer\nagainst these defendants fails to raise an infer ence that\nthese defendants actually knew or were awar e of the\nsignificant risk of harm to the plaintif fs. However, we will\nreverse the grant of summary judgment for defendant\nBurley, because the plaintiffs have pr esented evidence that\nBurley told one of the plaintiffs that she\"kind of knew\" that\nWhetzel was \"messing\" with the female r esidents at YDC.\nThis evidence, along with Burley's admission in her\ndeposition that she heard numerous rumors that Whetzel\nwas having sex with the female residents, is sufficient to\nraise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Burley was\naware of the significant risk that Whetzel posed to the\nplaintiffs but did not adequately respond to this risk.1\n\fI. Facts and Procedural History\n\nYDC is a Pennsylvania Department of Public W elfare\ninstitution that houses adjudicated delinquent juvenile\noffenders, both male and female; the female r esidents range\nin age between 13 and 21 years and come from all areas of\nthe state. YDC is divided into several \"Units,\" and each of\nthese Units is itself divided into several \"cottages.\" Beers-\nCapitol and Tate were housed in Unit 7, which contained\nthe female residents. Unit 7 is comprised of three cottages:\n7A, 7B, and 7C.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The defendants also raise a defense of qualified immunity. This issue\nwas not reached by the District Court (because it granted summary\njudgment on the merits). With regar d to the defendants for whom we will\naffirm summary judgment, we need not decide the issue of qualified\nimmunity. With regard to the defendant for whom we will reverse\nsummary judgment, her acts of deliberate indif ference to an excessive\nrisk to the plaintiffs foreclose her claim of qualified immunity. See\ninfra\nnote 15.\n\n                                  4\n\n\n\nDefendant Robert Liggett is the Executive Dir ector of\nYDC; as such he has ultimate responsibility for the overall\noperation of YDC. His duties include managing YDC's daily\noperation, supervising and training the staf f, and\nformulating and implementing all operational policies,\nregulations, and practices. Defendant Charles Lee Earnhart\nwas the unit director for Units 7 and 8 during the relevant\ntime period. Earnhart was responsible for the day-to-day\noperations of Unit 7, including the supervision of the staff\nof the unit, and the review and evaluation of staff reports\nand scheduled work. Liggett directly supervised Earnhart,\nwho in turn directly supervised the unit managers, meeting\nwith these managers daily. Defendant Joseph Flecher was\nthe unit manager for Unit 7 during the relevant time period.\nUnit managers are responsible for developing, coordinating,\nand administering program services for their unit; they also\ndirectly supervise the cottage supervisors within their unit.\nCottage supervisors directly supervise counselors, youth\ndevelopment aides, and other staff in their cottages (no\ncottage supervisor is a defendant in this case). Defendant\nNora Burley was a counselor who worked in Unit 7, and\ndefendant Shirley Robinson was a youth development aide\nin Unit 7. Counselors provide security in the units and\nmonitor resident interactions, and youth development aides\nperform a similar role. Whetzel was also a youth\ndevelopment aide in Unit 7.\n\fNew staff members at YDC receive two weeks of training\non YDC policies. Because the residents incar cerated at YDC\noften have previously suffered sexual abuse and have\nbecome sexually active at an early age, this training\nincludes instruction on how to identify and appr opriately\nhandle cases of sexual victimization and abuse, and how to\ndeal with female residents who express sexual interest in\nstaff members. The staff are taught that the YDC residents\nare likely to express attraction to them and to approach\nthem in a sexual manner, and that any sexual relations\nwith residents are unethical and absolutely forbidden. Alice\nPeoples, the Training Manager at YDC, testified that YDC\nemployees are taught that children who ar e sexually\nabused often afterwards deny that the abuse occurred.\nPeoples also stated that she informs YDC employees at\ntheir training that they are legally responsible to report any\n\n                                5\n\n\n\nallegations of abuse, and that failure to r eport such\nallegations could result in them being char ged with abuse\nthemselves.\n\nYDC is subject to 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6311, a\nPennsylvania state law on child abuse reporting which\nprovides that any staff member of a facility like YDC who\nreceives an allegation of abuse or otherwise becomes aware\nof such abuse must notify the person in char ge of the\nfacility (in this case, Executive Director Liggett).2 Earnhart\ntestified that there is no discretion for YDC employees\nunder this law; notification of any allegation of or\ninformation about abuse must go to Liggett. Liggett is then\nresponsible for initiating an investigation into the alleged\nabuse. Part of the process of such an investigation includes\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Title 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 6311 pr ovides in pertinent part:\n\n       S 6311. Persons required to r eport suspected child abuse\n\n        (a) General rule.--Persons who, in the course of their employment,\n       occupation or practice of their profession, come into contact with\n       children shall report or cause a r eport to be made in accordance\n       with section 6313 (relating to reporting procedure) when they have\n       reasonable cause to suspect, on the basis of their medical,\n       professional or other training and experience, that a child coming\n       before them in their professional or official capacity is an abused\n       child. . . .\n\n        (b) Enumeration of persons required to report.--Persons required\n\f       to report under subsection (a) include, but ar e not limited to,\nany\n       . . . school administrator, school teacher , school nurse, social\n       services worker, day-care center worker or any other child-care or\n       foster-care worker, mental health professional, peace officer or\nlaw\n       enforcement official.\n\n        (c) Staff members of institutions, etc.--Whenever a person is\n       required to report under subsection (b) in the capacity as a member\n       of the staff of a medical or other public or private institution,\nschool,\n       facility or agency, that person shall immediately notify the person\nin\n       charge of the institution, school, facility or agency or the\ndesignated\n       agent of the person in charge. Upon notification, the person in\n       charge or the designated agent, if any, shall assume the\n       responsibility and have the legal obligation to report or cause a\n       report to be made in accordance with section 6313. This chapter\n       does not require more than one r eport from any such institution,\n       school, facility or agency.\n\n                               6\n\n\n\nsending notification of the alleged abuse within 24 hours to\nChild Line, a hotline for child abuse allegations. 3\n\nBecause this is an appeal of a grant of summary\njudgment, we must review the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the party against whom summary judgment\nwas entered. See Pi Lambda Phi Frater nity, Inc. v. University\nof Pittsburgh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770737\"><a href=\"/opinion/770737/pi-lambda-phi-fraternity-inc-a-corporation-with-its-principal-place-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 n.3 (3d Cir. 2000). We\ntherefore accept as true for the purposes of this appeal the\nplaintiffs' description of: (1) the abuse they suffered at YDC;\n(2) relevant abuse suffered by other residents; and (3) the\nactions and reactions of YDC staff when they were notified\nof such abuse.\n\nA. The Abuse Suffered by Beers-Capitol\n\nBeers-Capitol was 17 years old when she was\nincarcerated at YDC New Castle from February 3, 1994 to\nMarch 30, 1994. Whetzel started making sexual comments\nto Beers-Capitol a few weeks after she arrived. This\nescalated into Whetzel inappropriately touching Beers-\nCapitol in various public places at YDC. Whetzel then\nbegan waking Beers-Capitol up in the middle of the night to\nbring her into his office to molest her and ask her to have\nsex with him. When she refused, he took away her\nprivileges. Beers-Capitol eventually had sex with Whetzel\nabout a week or so before she was released, and she then\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Notwithstanding this training, there is evidence in the record that YDC\nemployees viewed claims made by residents with skepticism. Michael\nPogozelec, a counselor at YDC who is not a party in this case, testified\nin his deposition that\n\n       kids there [at YDC] are extr emely manipulative. When they come in,\n       they're used to getting their way any way they can out there on the\n       streets. . . . [A]ll of them came fr om homes that were highly\n       dysfunctional where they had to survive themselves either by\n       scheming, manipulating, intimidating, game-playing. So, staff\n       question things right off the bat. They don't believe everything\nthat\n       a student brings to their attention.\n\nThat this attitude was widespread at YDC is supported by a comment\ndefendant Flecher made to Robert McLean, an investigator hired by\nLiggett to look into allegations of abuse by Whetzel. Flecher told McLean\nthat \"these types of accusations [of sexual abuse] occur on a frequent\nbasis when female students become angry or upset with staff members.\"\n\n                               7\n\n\n\ncame to the conclusion that he had gotten her pr egnant.\nOn the day before she was released fr om YDC, Beers-\nCapitol was cleaning the unit's canteen with defendant\nShirley Robinson; at that time, she told Robinson that she\nhad had sex with Whetzel and that she believed Whetzel\nhad gotten her pregnant. Robinson did not believe that\nBeers-Capitol was serious in her allegation and r esponded\nby saying, \"Well, you know that you can get in trouble\nmaking accusations like that.\"\n\nIn her deposition, Robinson stated that, although\noriginally she did not believe Beers-Capitol's allegation, the\naccusation \"nagged\" her because she knew that any\nallegation had to be reported. She thus r eported the\naccusation to Earnhart the next day and wr ote up an\nincident report. According to Robinson's deposition, the\nfollowing day Earnhart called Beers-Capitol, who had been\nreleased by then, at her home in Erie, Pennsylvania, to\ncheck on the story, whereupon Beers-Capitol denied the\naccusation. However, according to Ear nhart's deposition,\nRobinson delayed for a longer period, possibly up to three\nweeks, before informing Earnhart of the allegation, and at\nthat point Earnhart asked defendant Flecher to call Beers-\nCapitol at home about the allegation, and Flecher did so at\nthat time.4 Beers-Capitol testified that someone from YDC\ncalled her at some point after her release and asked, \"Amie,\nwe have accusations we know Barry did not do. I need to\nask you, did you have sex with him?\" Beers-Capitol denied\n\fhaving sex with Whetzel.\n\nRobinson, Earnhart, and Flecher did not r eport Beers-\nCapitol's allegation to Liggett as requir ed by 23 Pa. Cons.\nStat. S 6311. Earnhart did check with the Medical\nDepartment and was informed that Beers-Capitol had had\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Earnhart's testimony on this issue is somewhat confused. His first\nresponse was that he did not think Robinson delayed three weeks in\nreporting the allegation to him, but when confr onted with the fact that\nFlecher's file notes show that the phone call to Beers-Capitol was made\nthree weeks after Beers-Capitol made her allegation, he seems to imply\nthat Robinson did in fact delay her report of the allegation for three\nweeks. Beers-Capitol's deposition is unclear as to who called her and\nwhen, except that the caller was a male YDC employee and that the call\nwas shortly after her release.\n\n                                 8\n\n\n\na pregnancy test on March 21, and that the results of the\ntest were negative. Of course, a negative pr egnancy test on\nMarch 21 is consistent with Whetzel impr egnating Beers-\nCapitol about a week or so before her r elease on March 30.\nAccording to her deposition, Beers-Capitol did not want her\nboyfriend at the time of her release (now her husband) to\nfind out that Whetzel had impregnated her , so she had sex\nwith her boyfriend soon following her release. Nine months\nlater, she gave birth to a son, whom she and her husband\nhave raised as their child. Although Beers-Capitol has\nnever had a paternity test done, she seems to be convinced\nthat Whetzel is her son's biological father.\n\nB. The Abuse Suffered by T ate\n\nAliya Tate was incarcerated at YDC fr om June 13, 1991\nthrough May 4, 1993 and from July 12, 1994 to March 28,\n1995. In November 1994, when she was 16, Tate was in a\ncounseling session with Whetzel in Whetzel's back office\ndiscussing Tate's past sexual abuse, wher eupon Whetzel\nbegan to rub Tate's leg and lower thigh. On several other\noccasions in November and December 1994 and January\n1995 Whetzel attempted to kiss Tate and touch her\ngenitals. On the night of December 12, Whetzel tried to\ntouch Tate inappropriately while they wer e alone in Unit 7's\nTV room, but Tate immediately left the r oom. At around\nthis time, two other students reported (falsely, according to\nTate) that Tate and Whetzel had had sex in the TV room on\nDecember 12. This allegation was reported to Liggett, who\nassigned Robert McLean to investigate. Tate testified that\nWhetzel threatened that he would lengthen her stay at YDC\nif she told anyone what he had done, so Tate gave McLean\n\fa sworn statement that nothing had occurr ed between her\nand Whetzel.\n\nFinally, on January 29, 1995 Whetzel corner ed Tate in\nthe back office at the unit, prevented her fr om leaving,\ngrabbed her, kissed her, put his hands down her pants and\nthen tried to pick her up and lick her chest. After this\nincident, Tate wrote up a Student Incident Report (SIR)\ncomplaining of Whetzel's behavior that evening along with\nthe previous incidents and gave it to the duty officer. The\nduty officer then notified Earnhart of the allegation. The\nnext day, Tate talked to Nora Burley about the previous\n\n                               9\n\n\n\nday's incident as well as all the past incidents with Whetzel,\nat which time, according to Tate's deposition, Burley said to\nher that \"she kind of knew he was messing with students\nbut she didn't know that he was messing with me.\"\n\nAs a result of Tate's filing of the SIR, Liggett instituted an\ninvestigation, and YDC notified Child Line. Child Line in\nturn notified the Pennsylvania State Police which initiated\nits own investigation into Whetzel's conduct, eventually\nresulting in Whetzel's criminal conviction. In the course of\ntheir investigation the police found two other for mer\nresidents of YDC who had been sexually assaulted by\nWhetzel: Melissa Guyaux and Tina McAfee.\n\nC. Relevant Abuse of Other Residents\n\nMelissa Guyaux was at YDC from August 1992 to July\n1993. Guyaux testified at Whetzel's criminal trial that she\nhad had sex with Whetzel on many occasions during her\ntime at YDC. Guyaux stated that Whetzel often came into\nher room in the middle of the night, took her to the\ncanteen, and even took her out of school in the middle of\nthe day to have sex with her. In March 1993 it came to\nNora Burley's attention that another YDC resident alleged\nthat Whetzel and Guyaux were having sex. Burley set up a\nmeeting to investigate these allegations. Whetzel br ought\nGuyaux to the meeting and threatened her en r oute, saying\nthat he would extend her stay at YDC if she said anything.\nGuyaux thus denied having sex with Whetzel at the\nmeeting; Liggett was not notified of the allegation.\n\nTina McAfee was at YDC from May 1994 to February\n1995. During this time, Whetzel counseled McAfee about\nher previous sexual abuse as a child. At one session, while\nMcAffee was talking about past instances of rape and\nabuse, Whetzel asked her if it felt good and pointed to her\nvagina. Subsequently, Whetzel would wake McAfee in the\n\fmiddle of the night to have sex with her. On a couple of\noccasions, Flecher became aware of rumors that Whetzel\nwas having sex with McAfee (one of the times it was\nWhetzel himself who approached Flecher, expressing\n\"concern\" over these \"rumors\"). Flecher twice talked to\nMcAfee about these allegations, but she denied them both\ntimes. Flecher never informed Liggett about the allegations.\n\n                               10\n\n\n\nFinally, during his investigation of the reports that Tate\nand Whetzel had sex on Decemeber 12, 1994, investigator\nRobert McLean learned from Flecher that another female\nresident of YDC, Jochabed Good, had told a judge in mid-\n1994 that \"YDC was unsafe and `some staf f members at the\nYDC are having sex with students.' \" It is not clear from the\nrecord when Flecher became aware of Good's allegation, or\nwhat Flecher did in response.\n\nD. Procedural History\n\nThe plaintiffs brought suit in the District Court for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania under 42 U.S.C. S 1983,\nalleging that they were subjected to cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution because they were sexually\nassaulted by Whetzel while incarcerated at YDC. 5 All of the\ndefendants except Whetzel moved for summary judgment.\nIn deciding this motion, the District Court applied the two-\npart test from Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), for\nfinding an Eighth Amendment violation by a prison official:\n(1) a sufficiently serious constitutional deprivation; and (2)\ndeliberate indifference by the prison official-defendants.\n\nAs noted above, it is not disputed that the sexual abuse\nsuffered by the plaintiffs was sufficiently serious to support\nan Eighth Amendment claim, so the key issue in the case\nis whether the defendants exhibited deliberate indif ference\nto the plaintiffs' health or safety. The District Court granted\nthe defendants' motion for summary judgment, concluding\nthat the plaintiffs had not \"demonstrated a triable issue of\nfact as to whether any of the moving defendants wer e\ndeliberately indifferent to a substantial risk to [the]\nplaintiffs' rights.\" D. Ct. Mem. Op. at 8. This timely appeal\nfollowed. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. SS 1331 & 1343, and we have jurisdiction pursuant\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The plaintiffs also originally br ought claims under the Fourth, Ninth,\nand Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court r ejected these claims\nbecause it concluded that an Eighth Amendment analysis was the\nproper one to use for claims arising fr om incarceration in a facility for\n\fjuvenile offenders. See Dist. Ct. Mem. Op. at 7. The plaintiffs do not\npress these other claims on appeal.\n\n                                11\n\n\n\nto 28 U.S.C. S 1291. We set forth the familiar standard of\nreview of grants of summary judgment in the mar gin.6\n\nII. Discussion\n\nBecause this case turns on the plaintif fs' claims of\ndeliberate indifference, we begin our analysis with an\nexamination of the Supreme Court and Thir d Circuit\njurisprudence on deliberate indifference in the context of an\nEighth Amendment prison conditions claim. We then apply\nthis analytical structure to the plaintif fs' claims against\neach of the defendants.\n\nA. The Law on Deliberate Indiffer ence in a Prison\n       Conditions Case\n\n1.\n\nThe leading Supreme Court case setting forth the Eighth\nAmendment deliberate indifference analysis for a prison\nconditions case is Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994).\nIn Farmer, the Supreme Court r eversed a grant of summary\njudgment for various defendant prison officials on the\nplaintiff 's Eighth Amendment claim, which was based on\nthe deliberate indifference that the officials allegedly\nshowed to his risk of being sexually assaulted in prison. In\nits analysis on what type of showing is needed to establish\ndeliberate indifference by a defendant, Farmer rejected an\nobjective test for deliberate indiffer ence; instead it looked to\nwhat the prison official actually knew rather than what a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We exercise plenary review over a District Court's grant of summary\njudgment and review the facts in the light most favorable to the party\nagainst whom summary judgment was entered. See Pi Lambda Phi\nFraternity, Inc. v. University of Pittsburgh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770737\"><a href=\"/opinion/770737/pi-lambda-phi-fraternity-inc-a-corporation-with-its-principal-place-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 n.3 (3d\nCir.\n2000). Summary judgment is proper if ther e is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact and if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.

More\nspecifically, the Court held that \"a prison official cannot be\nfound liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an\ninmate humane conditions of confinement unless the\nofficial knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate\nhealth or safety.\" Id. at 837.\n\nThis requirement of actual knowledge means that \"the\nofficial must both be aware of facts fr om which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\nharm exists, and he must also draw the infer ence.\" Id.\nFarmer explained, however, that this subjective knowledge\nrequirement does not mean that a prison official can avoid\nliability by remaining deliberately indif ferent to an excessive\nor substantial risk of serious harm to prisoners:\n\n       We are no more persuaded by petitioner's argument\n       that, without an objective test for deliberate\n       indifference, prison officials will be free to ignore\n       obvious dangers to inmates. Under the test we adopt\n       today, an Eighth Amendment claimant need not show\n       that a prison official acted or failed to act believing that\n       harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that\n       the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge\n       of a substantial risk of serious harm.\n\nId. at 842.\n\nMoreover, a defendant's knowledge of a risk can be\nproved indirectly by circumstantial evidence. \"[A] factfinder\nmay conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial\nrisk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.\" Id. (citing\nWayne R. LaFave & Austin W. Scott, Jr ., Substantive\nCriminal Law S 3.7, p. 335 (1986) (\"[I]f the risk is obvious,\nso that a reasonable man would realize it, we might well\ninfer that [the defendant] did in fact r ealize it. . . .\")). In\nfact, Farmer anticipated that a plaintiff could make out a\ndeliberate indifference case by showing that prison officials\nsimply were aware of a general risk to inmates in the\nplaintiff 's situation:\n\n       [I]f an Eighth Amendment plaintiff pr esents evidence\n       showing that a substantial risk of inmate attacks was\n       longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expr essly\n       noted by prison officials in the past, and the\n\n                               13\n\n\n\n       circumstances suggest that the defendant-official being\n\f       sued had been exposed to information concer ning the\n       risk and thus must have known about it, then such\n       evidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to\n       find that the defendant-official had actual knowledge of\n       the risk.\n\nId. at 842-43 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\nSimilarly, Farmer made clear that a prison official\ndefendant cannot escape liability by showing that he did\nnot know that this particular inmate was in danger of\nattack: \"it does not matter . . . whether a prisoner faces an\nexcessive risk of attack for reasons personal to him or\nbecause all prisoners in his situation face such a risk.\" Id.\nat 843.\n\nFarmer emphasized further that, while a prison official's\nknowledge of an excessive risk of serious har m may be\ninferred from the fact that the risk is obvious, this inference\nis not compelled, as the official always must have an\nopportunity to show that he was unaware of the risk. See\nid. at 844. Finally, the official who is actually aware of the\nrisk to the prisoner can avert liability by showing that he\nresponded reasonably to the risk, even if the ultimate harm\nwas not avoided. See id.\n\nThe Court in Farmer also discussed the showing that a\nplaintiff needs to make to survive a summary judgment\nmotion on a deliberate indifference claim. Although this\ndiscussion was in the context of a claim for an injunction,\nit may be applied to a claim for damages. The Court stated\nthat \"to survive summary judgment, [the plaintiff] must\ncome forward with evidence from which it can be inferred\nthat the defendant-officials were at the time suit was filed,\nand are at the time of summary judgment, knowingly and\nunreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of\nharm.\" Id. at 846. We r ead this discussion in Farmer to\nmean that, to defeat the summary judgment motion, Beers-\nCapitol and Tate must present enough evidence to support\nthe inference that the defendants \"knowingly and\nunreasonably disregarded an objectively intolerable risk of\nharm.\"\n\nOur decision in Hamilton v. Leavy, 117 F .3d 742 (3d Cir.\n1997), is instructive because it applies Far mer's deliberate\n\n                               14\n\n\n\nindifference test to a situation somewhat similar to the case\nat bar. In Hamilton, a prisoner br ought an Eighth\nAmendment deliberate indifference claim against certain\nprison officials, alleging that the officials were deliberately\nindifferent to the risk to his safety posed by other inmates\n\fwhen they transferred him to a certain Delawar e state\nprison. Plaintiff Hamilton had been attacked and seriously\ninjured by other inmates at this prison. The court granted\nsummary judgment for Lewis, the prison official who was in\ncharge of prisoner transfers, on the basis of Lewis's affidavit\nthat she did not know of any risk posed to Hamilton by the\ntransfer. The district court granted summary judgment to\nthe other defendants, who were members of the prison\nsystem's \"Multi-Disciplinary Team\" (MDT), because the\ncourt concluded that the MDT had acted reasonably and\n\"did everything they could\" after they lear ned of the risk to\nHamilton (the MDT had recommended that Hamilton be\nplaced in protective custody at the prison before he was\nattacked). Id. at 748. We reversed.\n\nFirst, we noted that Hamilton had presented sufficient\ncircumstantial evidence that Lewis was awar e of the risk\nposed to Hamilton to survive summary judgment: Lewis\nhad probably received the MDT recommendation (she did\nnot deny this); Lewis knew that Hamilton was a prison\ninformant and thus was more likely to be harmed by other\ninmates; and Lewis herself had approved pr otective custody\nfor Hamilton on two prior occasions. See id. at 747. We held\nthat this proffered evidence was similar to the type of\ncircumstantial evidence anticipated as sufficient by Farmer,\ni.e., it was sufficient evidence \"upon which a factfinder\ncould conclude that Lewis `must have known' of the risk to\nHamilton's safety.\" Id. at 748 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n842). Second, we reversed the grant of summary judgment\nfor the MDT defendants because Hamilton demonstrated\nthat there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether these\ndefendants could have done something more than merely\noffer a recommendation; for example, they could have\nplaced Hamilton in administrative segregation. We thus\nheld that \"there remains a genuine issue of material fact\nregarding whether the MDT's response to the risk Hamilton\nfaced was reasonable.\" Id.\n\n                               15\n\n\n\nFrom Farmer and Hamilton we extract the following\nprecepts. To be liable on a deliberate indifference claim, a\ndefendant prison official must both \"know[ ] of and\ndisregard[ ] an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\"\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837. The knowledge element of\ndeliberate indifference is subjective, not objective\nknowledge, meaning that the official must actually be aware\nof the existence of the excessive risk; it is not sufficient that\nthe official should have been aware. See id. at 837-38.\nHowever, subjective knowledge on the part of the official\ncan be proved by circumstantial evidence to the effect that\nthe excessive risk was so obvious that the official must\n\fhave known of the risk. See id. at 842. Finally, a defendant\ncan rebut a prima facie demonstration of deliberate\nindifference either by establishing that he did not have the\nrequisite level of knowledge or awareness of the risk, or\nthat, although he did know of the risk, he took r easonable\nsteps to prevent the harm from occurring. See id. at 844.\n\n2.\n\nThe plaintiffs' theory as to how the defendants' actions\nand inactions constitute deliberate indiffer ence proceeds\nalong two basic lines. First, the plaintiffs contend that some\nof the defendants knew of the abuse committed by Whetzel\nor were aware of the high risk of abuse, but declined to act\nor to seek more information about it. Second, the plaintiffs\nalso claim that the supervisor defendants, while per haps\nnot aware of the particular risk that Whetzel posed to these\nspecific plaintiffs, implemented policies that were so\ndefective that they created an unreasonable and excessive\nrisk of abuse to the female residents generally at YDC, and\nthat the defendants were aware of this risk.\n\nBoth of these approaches depend upon the thesis that all\nof the defendants were trained experts in the area of\njuvenile detention, so that, given what they knew, they\nmust have been aware of the excessive risks of harm to the\nplaintiffs that existed at YDC. In particular , the plaintiffs\ncontend that those defendants who were r esponsible for\nimplementing the policies at YDC had to know that the\npolicies and procedures at YDC created substantial general\nrisks of sexual abuse for the female residents there, as\n\n                               16\n\n\n\nthese defendants were trained how to minimize those risks.\nThe plaintiffs assert further that those defendants who\nworked directly with the female residents had to know of\nthe particular risk that Whetzel posed because they were\ntrained to recognize cases of sexual abuse and they were\naware of persistent allegations of his sexual r elationships\nwith the residents.\n\nThe deliberate indifference claims implicating supervisors\nfor their deficient policies are more complicated than the\nother, more direct deliberate indif ference claims, because\nthe former add another level to the analysis. Both the\nplaintiffs and the defendants argue that we should analyze\nthe supervisor-centered claims under the four-part test for\nsupervisor liability developed in Sample v. Diecks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529726\"><a href=\"/opinion/529726/joseph-b-sample-v-ernest-e-diecks-sro-sciph-james-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1989).7 Sample involved a claim that a\nsupervisor was liable for a subordinate's Eighth\nAmendment violation because the supervisor implemented\n\fdeficient policies and was deliberately indif ferent to the risk\nthese policies generated. Although the claim in Sample does\nnot seem to be precisely the same as the plaintiffs' claim in\nthe case at bar--Sample concerned whether a supervisor\ncould be liable for a subordinate's Eighth Amendment tort\nwhile the plaintiffs here seem to claim that the supervisors\ncommitted their own Eighth Amendment violations by\nimplementing defective policies--we do not think this\ndifference material.\n\nIn Sample, the plaintiff (Sample) had his life sentence for\nmurder vacated by the Pennsylvania Supr eme Court, and\nwas granted bail pending the new trial.

See Sample, 885 F .2d at 1118.\n\nAccording to Sample, one way--per haps the easiest way--\na plaintiff can make out a supervisor liability claim is by\nshowing that \"the supervisory official failed to respond\nappropriately in the face of an awareness of a pattern of\nsuch injuries.\" Id. But that is not the only way to make out\nsuch a claim, as \"there are situations in which the risk of\nconstitutionally cognizable harm is so gr eat and so obvious\nthat the risk and the failure of supervisory officials to\nrespond will alone support findings of the existence of an\nunreasonable risk, of knowledge of that unr easonable risk,\nand of indifference to it.\" Id.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8.

Brennan: They must show that the defendants\nknew or were aware of and disregar ded an excessive risk to\nthe plaintiffs' health or safety, and they can show this by\nestablishing that the risk was obvious. For the plaintiffs'\nclaims seeking to hold supervisors liable for their deficient\npolicies, Sample's four-part test pr ovides the analytical\nstructure for determining whether the policymakers\nexhibited deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' risk of\ninjury, it being simply the deliberate indif ference test\napplied to the specific situation of a policymaker .\n\nB. The Allegations Against the Defendants: Applying The\n       Test\n\n1. Robert Liggett, Executive Director of YDC\n\nAs the Executive Director of YDC, Liggett has ultimate\nresponsibility for the overall operation of YDC. His duties\ninclude managing YDC's daily operation, supervising and\ntraining the staff, and formulating and implementing all\noperational policies, regulations, and practices. The\nplaintiffs concede that Liggett did not have actual\n\fknowledge of Whetzel's abuse of the plaintif fs, nor of the\nspecific risk that Whetzel posed to the plaintif fs, until after\nthe fact. Instead, the plaintiffs level a claim of supervisor\nliability against Liggett, contending that the policies and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ngreat and so obvious\" a risk). In Stoneking, the plaintiff, a student in\nthe\nBradford school district, sought to hold the school district and its\nofficials liable for a teacher's sexual assault on her, on the theory that\nthe school district and officials maintained a practice, custom, or policy\nof deliberate indifference to instances of known or suspected sexual\nabuse by teachers. Stoneking, like Sample, followed the reasoning of City\nof Canton, and held that \"if the need for mor e or different training is\nso\nobvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of\nconstitutional rights, `the policymakers . . . can reasonably be said to\nhave been deliberately indifferent to the need.' \" Id. at 725 (quoting\nCity\nof Canton v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112209\"><a href=\"/opinion/112209/canton-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (1989)).\n\n                                19\n\n\n\nprocedures that Liggett implemented and approved created\nan unreasonably unsafe environment at YDC that allowed\nWhetzel to commit his abuse over an extended period, and\nthat Liggett knew that his policies were deficient in this\nway.\n\nThe plaintiffs' allegations of Liggett's policymaking\ninadequacies fall into three categories: (1) the failure to\nfollow accepted standards for the basic structure and\nstaffing of juvenile residential facilities; (2) the failure to\nproperly train staff to recognize child abuse; and (3) the\npromulgation of de facto policies and the failure to\nimplement other policies, ultimately leading to the stifling of\ncomplaints of abuse and incompetent investigations of the\ncomplaints that were made. The plaintif fs' expert, John\nCocoros (a consultant with extensive experience in the field\nof residential facilities for delinquent youths), opined in a\nwritten report prepared for the plaintiffs that these\ndeficiencies created a situation in which YDC failed to have\n\"basic precepts of institutional management without which\nno administrator can claim to operate a facility which\nprovides safety and security for its staf f and residents,\"\nthus \"unnecessarily plac[ing] juveniles at high risk for\nabuse at the hands of staff \" and \"cr eating an environment\nin which eventual abuse was virtually predictable.\"\n\nRegarding the first area of allegedly deficient\npolicymaking by Liggett, the plaintiffs point to five\ninadequacies with the basic structure of YDC: (1) YDC did\n\fnot require that a female staff member be present at all\ntimes in the female units, in contravention of the American\nCorrectional Association's Standards for Juvenile Training\nSchools No. 3-JTS-3A-07; (2) there was poor or nonexistent\nsupervision of the staff at night (when Whetzel committed\nmany of his abuses); (3) YDC had no observation or\nsurveillance system (thus ensuring that Whetzel could take\nfemale residents to areas where they would be unobserved);\n(4) YDC permitted private, unsupervised interactions\nbetween male staff and female residents; and (5) YDC\npermitted unsupervised trips off-gr ounds by female\nresidents solely accompanied by male staf f.\n\nWith respect to the failure of staf f training, the plaintiffs\ncontend that, despite rules that requir ed and staff training\n\n                               20\n\n\n\nthat emphasized that all allegations of abuse be r eported,\nLiggett allowed staff members to decide on their own\nwhether to report an allegation. Because the allegations\nagainst Whetzel were reported to dif ferent staff members,\nmany of whom did not report those allegations to Liggett,\nno one person knew the extent of the allegations against\nWhetzel. In their brief, the plaintiffs list seven different\nemployees who were aware of differ ent allegations against\nWhetzel but who did not report these allegations to Liggett.\nSee Pls.' Br. at 24 n.8. The plaintif fs argue that Liggett's\nfailure to have any sort of review pr ocedure in place to\ndetermine whether the notification policy was being\nfollowed, along with his failure to discipline these\nemployees after this information came out or to train them\nproperly in the first place, were serious policy deficiencies\nthat, according to Cocoros, led to the cr eation of a staff\nsubculture in which a staff member's abuses could go\nunaddressed.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs assert that Liggett's policies failed to\nprovide the juveniles under his care with multiple and\neasily accessible opportunities for them to r eport abuse.\nThey contend that any reports of abuse that wer e made\nwere incompetently investigated under Liggett's overall\nsupervision. According to the plaintiffs, Liggett's policies\nallowed his staff to respond to initial allegations with\nthreats (Robinson, Whetzel) and confrontation (Earnhart).\nWhen a report did reach Liggett, he is alleged either to have\nfailed to initiate an investigation (as with Jocheded Good's\nallegation),9 or to have initiated inadequate investigations\n(as with the two Tate allegations, both of which were\ndetermined by YDC to be unfounded although the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f9. At one point in their brief, the plaintif fs claim that Liggett knew\nabout\nGood's allegation, but in another section they assert that Flecher failed\nto notify Liggett of Good's allegation. See Pls.' Br. at 24, 32. The\nimplication of the plaintiffs' claim that Flecher did not inform Liggett\nof\nthe allegation is that Flecher knew of the allegation but Liggett did not;\nthus, the plaintiffs' claims here may be inconsistent. Because we must\ndraw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party in a review of a\nsummary judgment motion, we conclude for the purposes of this appeal\nthat Flecher did not inform Liggett of Good's allegation but that Liggett\nlearned of it through some other means.\n\n                               21\n\n\n\nPennsylvania state police determined them to be true in its\ninvestigation).\n\nBecause we are reviewing the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment, we take the above allegations to be\ntrue and we must now consider whether they ar e legally\nsufficient to support a claim of deliberate indif ference past\nthe summary judgment stage. More specifically, the\nrelevant issue is whether the above-described policymaking\ninadequacies raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether the four-part test for deliberate indifference from\nSample is met. As we noted above, Sample provides two\nmethods of meeting this test: (i) showing that the\nsupervisor failed to adequately respond to a pattern of past\noccurrences of injuries like the plaintif fs', or (ii) showing\nthat the risk of constitutionally cognizable har m was \"so\ngreat and so obvious that the risk and the failure of\nsupervisory officials to respond will alone\" support finding\nthat the four-part test is met. Sample v. Diecks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529726\"><a href=\"/opinion/529726/joseph-b-sample-v-ernest-e-diecks-sro-sciph-james-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs have not met their burden\nof showing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether Liggett exhibited deliberate indif ference in his\npolicymaking. Considering the first method of meeting the\nSample test, the plaintiffs have not shown that Liggett was\naware of a \"pattern\" of sexual assaults being committed by\nYDC employees. See id. At most, they have alleged that\nLiggett was aware of Good's allegation and that he was\naware of two allegations regarding T ate. Such knowledge\ncannot benefit Beers-Capitol in her claim against Liggett\nbecause the behavior described in the allegations occurred\nafter her abuse, and a successful deliberate indif ference\nclaim requires showing that the defendant knew of the risk\nto the plaintiff before the plaintiff 's injury occurred. See\nLewis v. Richards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736255\"><a href=\"/opinion/736255/tommy-ray-lewis-v-thomas-d-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(holding that a plaintiff cannot make out a deliberate\n\findifference claim against prison officials for a prison attack\nwhen the plaintiff presented evidence that the defendants\nknew of the attack afterwards but presented no evidence\nthat defendants knew of the risk to the defendant before\nthe attack). Because Whetzel's abuse of Beers-Capitol\noccurred approximately eight months befor e Whetzel's\n\n                               22\n\n\n\nabuse of Tate, some evidence of the defendants' awareness\nof Whetzel's activities is available to Tate but not Beers-\nCapitol.\n\nTate could argue that Liggett knew of Good's allegation\nand her first allegation before her final abuse had occurred,\nbut we do not believe that two allegations constitute a\n\"pattern of past occurrences\" as contemplated by Sample.\nFurthermore, even if two instances is a pattern, this is not\na pattern of known injuries, but a pattern of known\nallegations, which is quite differ ent; they are known to be\ninjuries now, but it is what Liggett knew at the time, not\nwhat he knows now, that is material.\n\nThe plaintiffs concentrate their argument on the second\nmethod of meeting the Sample test--the existence of \"so\ngreat and so obvious\" a risk, which is alleged to have arisen\nas a result of deficient policies and practices that were in\nplace before the attacks on Beers-Capitol. T o make their\nargument, the plaintiffs point to Cocor os's conclusion that\nYDC's administration showed \"reckless disr egard for the\nsafety of residents.\" This conclusion is suf fused with legal\nconsiderations, and it is our province to deter mine whether\nthe factual conclusions in Cocoros's report support the\nlegal conclusion of deliberate indiffer ence. The report shows\nthat YDC did not implement a number of policies that were\nstandard or recommended in the juvenile detention field,\nand that YDC's policies and procedures could have been\nbetter. We note in passing that the r eport, if accurate, is an\nindictment of the administration of the YDC by Liggett and\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfar e. Most\nimportantly, the plaintiffs argue for cefully that Liggett's\npolicymaking created an \"institutional mindset\" that\nallowed Whetzel's abuse to go on for as long as it did.\n\nThe deliberate indifference standar d as set out in Farmer\nis a high one, however--requiring actual knowledge or\nawareness on the part of the defendant--and the plaintiffs'\nevidence here is not sufficient to cr eate a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether the above policies and practices\ncreated a risk of harm to the plaintif fs that was \"so great\nand so obvious\" that Liggett must have known of the\nexcessive risk but was indifferent to it. Although Cocoros's\n\freport does seem to raise a genuine issue as to Liggett's\n\n                               23\n\n\n\nnegligence, it is not \"evidence from which it can be inferred\"\nthat Liggett \"knowingly and unreasonably disregard[ed] an\nobjectively intolerable risk of harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n846; see also Steele v.

The plaintiff 's evidence may raise an issue of\nmaterial fact as to the former but it does not for the latter.\nWe therefore will affirm the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment for Liggett.\n\n2. Charles Earnhart, Director of Unit 7\n\nEarnhart was the unit director of Unit 7 during the\nrelevant time period, responsible for the day-to-day\noperations of Unit 7, which included supervising the staff of\nthe unit and reviewing and evaluating r eports and\nscheduled work. Earnhart directly supervised the unit\nmanagers, meeting with these managers daily.\n\nThe plaintiffs' deliberate indiffer ence claims against\nEarnhart involve a combination of direct and supervisor\nliability. First, the plaintiffs assert that Earnhart\nparticipated in formulating and implementing the policy\nthat allowed the night shift in the female r esidents' unit to\nbe without a female staff member, as well as the policy\npermitting unsupervised male staff to take female residents\noff-grounds. The analysis of this claim of deliberate\nindifference proceeds along the same lines as outlined\nabove for Liggett (with the four-part test fr om Sample), but\nthis supervisory-based claim is weaker than the one against\nLiggett that we rejected above. As to whether Earnhart was\naware of a pattern of past injuries, the facts as alleged only\nsupport the conclusion that he knew of Beers-Capitol's\n\n                               24\n\fallegation, and one incident does not a patter n make. As to\nthe \"so great and so obvious a risk\" method of meeting\nSample's test, the analysis begins and ends just as it did\nfor Liggett. In fact, because Earnhart's supervisory\nresponsibility at YDC was not as great as Liggett's, there is\nless evidence that Earnhart's policies cr eated a risk that\nwas \"so great and so obvious\" that he must have known of\nthe excessive risk but was indifferent to it. For these\nreasons, the plaintiffs' claims of deliberate indifference\nagainst Earnhart based on supervisor liability cannot\nsurvive summary judgment.\n\nThe plaintiffs also submit that Earnhart directly\nexhibited deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' injuries\nthrough two other actions: (1) by failing to discipline\nRobinson for delaying her reporting of Beers-Capitol's\nallegation of abuse; and (2) by mishandling Beers-Capitol's\nallegation, in that (a) Earnhart did not r eport it to Liggett\n(as required by law); and (b) Earnhart \"undertook a wholly\ninadequate investigation,\" namely, merely calling Beers-\nCapitol at home and asking her over the phone if the abuse\noccurred.10\n\nWe note first that Beers-Capitol cannot use the above two\nactions to support her claim that Earnhart was aware of\nthe risk of abuse to her because these actions took place\nafter Beers-Capitol's abuse. In the absence of any other\nevidence that Earnhart was aware of an excessive risk to\nBeers-Capitol, Beers-Capitol cannot make out a dir ect\ndeliberate indifference claim against Ear nhart. See Lewis v.\nRichards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736255\"><a href=\"/opinion/736255/tommy-ray-lewis-v-thomas-d-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\nHowever, Tate can claim that Ear nhart's actions\nsurrounding Beers-Capitol's abuse (which occurr ed before\nthe abuse Tate suffered) ar e evidence that, by the time of\nTate's abuse, Earnhart was aware of but ignored the\nexcessive risk to the female residents posed by Whetzel. We\nnonetheless conclude that this evidence is insufficient to\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nEarnhart was deliberately indiffer ent. It is not apparent\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Although it is unclear from the r ecord whether Earnhart called\nBeers-Capitol himself or had Flecher call Beers-Capitol, see supra page\n8 & note 4, this does not affect our analysis.\n\n                               25\n\n\n\nhow Earnhart's failure to discipline Robinson for her brief\ndelay in reporting Beers-Capitol's allegation demonstrates\nthat Earnhart was deliberately indiffer ent to a risk to Tate.\nFurthermore, although Earnhart pr obably should have\n\fbetter handled the investigation into Beers-Capitol's\nallegation, this lapse is not nearly enough to clear the high\nbar set by Farmer: raising an infer ence that he \"knowingly\nand unreasonably disregard[ed] an objectively intolerable\nrisk of harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 846. We therefore will\naffirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment for\nEarnhart.\n\n3. Joseph Flecher, Manager of Unit 7\n\nFlecher was the unit manager for Unit 7 during the\nrelevant time period. Unit managers are r esponsible for\ndeveloping, coordinating, and administering pr ogram\nservices for their unit; they also directly supervise the\ncottage supervisors within their unit. As with Ear nhart, the\nplaintiffs' claims of Flecher's deliberate indifference\ncombine direct and supervisor liability. First, the plaintiffs\nclaim that Flecher failed to adequately train the staff under\nhim to recognize abuse. Second (and relatedly), plaintiffs\nassert that Flecher carried out a de facto policy of failing to\nnotify Liggett of allegations of abuse and of disbelieving\nsuch allegations when they were presented to him, because,\nas Flecher stated to Investigator McLean, \"these types of\naccusations occur on a frequent basis when female\nstudents become upset or angry with staff members.\" The\nplaintiffs also have presented evidence that supports a\nclaim of direct liability against Flecher , namely that, in the\ntime period before Tate's abuse but after Beers-Capitol's,\nFlecher had notice of, but did not adequately r espond to,\nWhetzel's abusive activities.11 The evidence is: (1) Flecher's\nfailure to notify Liggett of Beers-Capitol's allegations; (2)\nFlecher's failure to notify Liggett of Good's allegations; (3)\nFlecher's failure to notify Liggett of McAfee's allegations; (4)\nFlecher's failure to make any recor ding of McAfee's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. As above, this evidence only supports T ate's claim against Flecher,\nnot Beers-Capitol's, because all of these actions occurred after Beers-\nCapitol's abuse.\n\n                                26\n\n\n\nallegations; and (5) Flecher's failure to conduct adequate\ninvestigations of Beers-Capitol's, McAfee's, and Good's\nallegations.\n\nOf the three supervisor defendants (Liggett, Earnhart,\nand Flecher), Flecher appears to be the one who had the\nmost information about what was going on with Whetzel.\nFurthermore, because he was the manager of Unit 7,\nFlecher was in a position both to conduct investigations\ninto Whetzel's behavior and to inform Liggett of any\n\fproblems and allegations regarding Whetzel. The plaintiffs\nargue that the combination of Flecher's knowledge of the\nallegations against Whetzel, Flecher's failur e to follow YDC\nprocedures and Pennsylvania law in not notifying Liggett of\nthese allegations, and Flecher's own inadequate\ninvestigations of the allegations together cr eate a genuine\nissue of fact as to Flecher's deliberate indif ference.\nAlthough there is no direct evidence that Flecher was aware\nof Whetzel's activities, the plaintiffs contend that Flecher\nhad heard enough allegations against Whetzel and knew\nenough about the inadequate system for addressing those\nallegations that he must have known of the excessive risk\nof harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nWhile this issue is a close one, we conclude that the\nplaintiffs' evidence does not create a genuine issue of fact\nas to Flecher's deliberate indifference. The plaintiffs have\nprovided evidence that Flecher was awar e of three\nallegations of abuse by Whetzel, but there is no evidence\nthat Flecher believed that these allegations wer e likely to be\ntrue, or that the evidence surrounding the allegations was\nso strong that he must have believed them likely to be true.\nIn fact, the plaintiffs have presented evidence that Flecher\ndisbelieved the allegations: his statement to McLean that\n\"these types of accusations occur on a fr equent basis when\nfemale students become upset or angry with staf f\nmembers.\" See supra note 3. This statement is illuminating\nof Flecher's subjective mindset of basic skepticism\nregarding the allegations raised by the female YDC\nresidents; although this mindset does not comport well with\nYDC's official policies and Pennsylvania law, it is also\ninconsistent with the subjective knowledge of a risk\nrequired for deliberate indiffer ence under Farmer.\n\n                               27\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs here have failed to pr esent the kind of\nevidence that successful plaintiffs have pr esented in\ndeliberate indifference cases after Farmer: evidence that\ndirectly shows that Flecher either knew of the excessive risk\nto the plaintiffs or was aware of such overwhelming\nevidence that he had to know of such a risk. The case is\nthus different from Hamilton v.

While this course of action was\nimprudent, and in fact led to a very regr ettable outcome, it\ndoes not constitute deliberate indiffer ence as the Supreme\nCourt defined that concept in Farmer. Moreover, the\nplaintiffs have presented no other evidence that shows that\nFlecher was subjectively aware of the excessive risk to the\nplaintiffs.

Nora Burley, Counselor in Unit 7\n\nBurley worked in Unit 7 as a counselor; her job was to\nprovide security in the unit and monitor r esident\ninteractions. The plaintiffs' deliberate indif ference claims\nagainst Burley center solely on direct liability, as Burley\nwas not a supervisor. The plaintiffs pr esent fairly\nsubstantial evidence of Burley's knowledge or awar eness of\nthe excessive risk that Whetzel posed to the female\nresidents. Burley testified in a deposition that, while she\nwas at YDC, she had heard general rumors fr om the\nresidents that Whetzel was having sex with some of the\nfemale residents, but she did not investigate these rumors\nor report them to her supervisors. She did, however, make\nfile notes of these rumors \"[t]o cover my behind, in case it\nwere true.\"\n\nBurley was also told on a couple of occasions that\nGuyaux claimed to have a sexual relationship with Whetzel.\nBurley did not inform her supervisors of this allegation, but\ninstead set up a meeting with Whetzel, Guyaux, and\n\n                               29\n\n\n\nanother counselor to ask Guyaux about it.13 Burley also\ntestified that she knew McAfee had a sexual inter est in\nWhetzel, although she did not report or investigate this.\nFinally, and most tellingly, Tate testified in her deposition\nthat Burley admitted to her that \"she kind of knew that\n[Whetzel] was messing with students\" when T ate told\nBurley of Whetzel's assault on her.14 [1532a, Tate Dep.]\n\nWe are satisfied that the plaintif fs have presented\nsufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact\nas to Burley's deliberate indifference to the excessive risk\nWhetzel posed to the plaintiffs. Burley's statement to Tate\nthat she \"kind of knew\" that Whetzel was \"messing\" with\nstudents is significant evidence that Burley was\"aware of\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed]\" and that she\n\"also dr[ew] the inference.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. The\nother evidence about what Burley knew strengthens this\nconclusion. Moreover, the fact that Burley said to Tate that\nshe did not know that Whetzel was \"messing\" with Tate in\nparticular does not constitute a defense to a deliberate\nindifference claim; Farmer is clear that a defendant need\nnot know that the particular inmate attacked was at risk,\nas it is enough for deliberate indiffer ence if a defendant\n\fknows that inmates in the plaintiff 's situation face such a\nrisk. See id. at 843-44.\n\nFor the purposes of reviewing a grant of summary\njudgment for the defendants, Burley basically admitted that\nshe had knowledge of Whetzel's abusive activities by the\ntime of Tate's abuse in her statement to T ate. The difficulty\nfor Beers-Capitol is that this admission was made in\nJanuary 1995, approximately ten months after Beers-\nCapitol was abused, and Beers-Capitol must show that\nBurley knew of the risk Whetzel posed before he abused\nBeers-Capitol. See Lewis v. Richards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736255\"><a href=\"/opinion/736255/tommy-ray-lewis-v-thomas-d-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553\n(7th Cir. 1997). However, even though the abuse of Beers-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. This was the meeting to which Whetzel br ought Guyaux, threatening\nher en route.\n\n14. Tate's recounting of Burley's comment is admissible evidence\nbecause, as an admission by a party-opponent, it is not hearsay under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).\n\n                               30\n\n\n\nCapitol occurred before Burley made her admission to Tate,\nwe think that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs raises\na genuine issue of fact as to what Burley was awar e of\nregarding Whetzel at the time Beers-Capitol was abused.\n\nBurley's awareness of Whetzel's activities had to have\nbeen based upon some information she r eceived before she\nmade her admission to Tate in January 1995. Burley\nadmitted in her deposition that, during her time at YDC,\nshe heard various rumors that Whetzel was having sex with\nfemale residents, and she made file notes of these rumors,\n\"[t]o cover my behind, in case it wer e true.\" Because we\ndraw all inferences in the non-movant's favor in our review\nof a summary judgment motion, we conclude that these\nrumors formed at least part of the basis for her awareness\nof Whetzel's activities. Burley had started to hear these\nrumors at least by March 1993 (a full year before Beers-\nCapitol was abused), when she set up a meeting with\nWhetzel and Melissa Guyaux to investigate rumors that\nWhetzel and Guyaux were having sex. Thus, Beers-Capitol\nhas shown that Burley received at least some of the\ninformation that formed the basis for her awareness before\nBeers-Capitol was abused.\n\nThe short of it is that, drawing all inferences in Beers-\nCapitol's favor, it is possible that Burley r eceived enough\ninformation about Whetzel's activities that she formed her\nawareness of these activities by March 1994, when Beers-\n\fCaitol was abused. This creates a genuine issue of fact as\nto what Burley knew when, and the evidence pr esented\ncould support a conclusion by the factfinder that Burley's\nawareness arose before March 1994. Under this\ncircumstance, the evidence presented r egarding Burley is\nsufficient to get both Tate and Beers-Capitol past summary\njudgment. We will thus reverse the grant of summary\njudgment for Burley on both plaintiffs' claims.15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. As we noted earlier, the defendants also assert qualified immunity;\nthe District Court did not reach this issue because it granted summary\njudgment to the defendants on the merits. While it is not necessary for\nus to decide this claim as to the other defendants because we will affirm\nthe summary judgment grants for them, it is a live issue as it relates to\nBurley. The qualified immunity argument fails, however, because, to the\n\n                               31\n\n\n\n5.

That is, the defendants must show that their conduct\ndid not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\"The contours of the right\nmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\nthat what he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson v.

Unlike Farmer's subjective test of what the prison\nofficial knew, the test for qualified immunity is objective. \"Under the\ntest\nannounced in Harlow, reasonableness is measured by an objective\nstandard; arguments that the defendants desired to handle or\nsubjectively believed that they had handled the incidents properly are\nirrelevant.\" Stoneking, 882 F.2d at 726 (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. at 641). That is, Burley is entitled to qualified immunity only if\nshe\ncan show that a reasonable person in her position at the relevant time\n\fcould have believed, in light of clearly established law, that her conduct\ncomported with established legal standards. See id.\n\nThere is no question that the plaintiffs' constitutional right that was\nviolated--the right not to be sexually abused by a state employee while\nin confinement--was clearly established at the time of Burley's relevant\nactions. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833-34; Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n102-03 (1976); Stoneking, 882 F.3d at 726. The doctrine of deliberate\nindifference was also clearly established at the relevant time. See\nEstelle,\n429 U.S. at 104-05. The key issue for our purposes is whether Burley's\nrelevant conduct was objectively reasonable, or, more specifically,\nwhether a reasonable YDC worker in her situation could have believed\nthat her conduct comported with established legal standards, i.e., she\nwas not being deliberately indifferent to the existence of an excessive\nrisk to the plaintiffs (either because she thought that there was no\nexcessive risk or because she thought that her r esponse was adequate).\nWe have determined, however, that the plaintiffs have raised a genuine\n\n                               32\n\n\n\nthe units and monitoring resident interactions. As with\nBurley, the plaintiffs' claims against Robinson involve only\ndirect liability. The plaintiffs pr offer the following two acts\nas evidence of Robinson's deliberate indiffer ence: (1) when\nBeers-Capitol told Robinson that Whetzel impr egnated her,\nRobinson's first response was to say, \"W ell, you know you\ncan get in trouble making accusations like that,\"; and (2)\nRobinson delayed reporting Beers-Capitol's allegation to her\nsupervisor (although it is unclear from the r ecord exactly\nhow long this delay was, as Robinson's and Ear nhart's\ntestimony differ on this point). Because these actions by\nRobinson occurred after Beers-Capitol's abuse, and the\nplaintiffs present no evidence regar ding Robinson's\nawareness of Whetzel's activities befor e that abuse, Beers-\nCapitol has presented no evidence to support her deliberate\nindifference claim against Robinson. See Lewis v. Richards,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736255\"><a href=\"/opinion/736255/tommy-ray-lewis-v-thomas-d-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (7th Cir. 1997). T ate, however, has a\npotential direct deliberate indiffer ence claim against\nRobinson, as her abuse occurred after Robinson's actions,\nand Tate can argue that these actions ar e evidence that, by\nthe time of Tate's abuse, Robinson was awar e of the risk\nWhetzel posed to the female residents but was indifferent to\nthis risk.\n\nNevertheless, we conclude that the above-described\nevidence is an insufficient basis for inferring that Robinson\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Burley was deliberately indifferent.\nBecause deliberate indifference underFarmer requires actual knowledge\nor awareness on the part of the defendant, a defendant cannot have\n\fqualified immunity if she was deliberately indif ferent; a reasonable YDC\nworker could not believe that her actions comported with clearly\nestablished law while also believing that ther e is an excessive risk to\nthe\nplaintiffs and failing to adequately r espond to that risk. Conduct that\nis\ndeliberately indifferent to an excessive risk to YDC residents cannot be\nobjectively reasonable conduct. See Carter v. City of Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that, if the plaintiff succeeds in\nestablishing that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to\nconstitutional rights, then a fortiori the defendants' conduct was not\nobjectively reasonable, and hence the defense of qualified immunity\nwould not be available to defendants). Because ther e is a genuine issue\nof fact as to whether Burley was deliberately indif ferent, she has not\ncarried her burden to establish that she is entitled to such immunity.\nWe thus reject Burley's qualified immunity claim.\n\n                               33\n\n\n\n\"knowingly and unreasonably disregar d[ed] an objectively\nintolerable risk of harm.\" Farmer , 511 U.S. at 846. The\nplaintiffs' evidence contains only a single instance where\nRobinson was informed of an allegation against Whetzel.\nMoreover, she did report this allegation to her supervisor\n(albeit after a short delay). While Robinson's r esponse to the\nallegation--telling Beers-Capitol that \"you can get in trouble\nmaking allegations like that\"--was certainly inappropriate\ngiven her responsibilities as a youth development aide, this\nimpropriety is not enough to show deliberate indifference.\nFurthermore, Robinson did report the allegation to her\nsupervisor, which was a reasonable r esponse. Although\nRobinson delayed her report somewhat, this minor delay\nsurely had little or no effect on Whetzel's risk to Tate, who\nwas not yet at YDC at the time of Beers-Capitol's allegation.\n\nThe most that Tate can claim is that Robinson's original\nresponse to Beers-Capitol and her delay in r eporting the\nallegation made Beers-Capitol less likely to continue to\nmaintain her allegation when later questioned. As with\nFlecher, however, such evidence goes to the adequacy of\nRobinson's response to the risk, and we do not reach that\nquestion until we determine that there is a genuine issue of\nas to Robinson's awareness of the risk. One allegation,\nlater denied, is not sufficient evidence for us to infer that\nRobinson knew or must have known of the risk to T ate. We\ntherefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for\nRobinson.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affir m the District\nCourt's grant of summary judgment as to the defendants\n\fLiggett, Earnhart, Flecher, and Robinson, and reverse the\ngrant of summary judgment for Burley. The case will be\nremanded to the District Court for further pr oceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Parties to bear their own\ncosts.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               34\n\f</pre>",
