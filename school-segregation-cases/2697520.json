We reverse the judgment of the trial court, we\r\nrender judgment in part, and we remand the cause.<sup> (1)</sup></span><span></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>Background</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn March 2002, Blue Flash, a trucking company with a facility in Harris\r\nCounty, Texas, filed a rendition with the District listing its business personal property\r\nfor taxation. Blue Flash listed a total of 67 vehicles, which included both vehicles that\r\nit had owned and vehicles that it had leased.  The District listed the vehicles under\r\ntwo accounts: account number 0595563, which included the 33 vehicles that Blue\r\nFlash owned, and 0950209, which included the 34 vehicles that Blue Flash leased. \r\nOn January 1, 2003, Blue Flash paid the taxes on account number 0595563 (the\r\nowned vehicles), but not on account number 0950209 (the leased vehicles).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2003, Blue Flash filed with the Board a correction motion under section\r\n25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code to correct account number 0595563 (\"the\r\naccount number 0595563 correction motion\") for the 2001 and 2002 tax years.  The\r\naccount number 0595563 correction motion alleged that the property had been over-appraised by more than one third for both of these years.  The Board issued an order\r\ngranting Blue Flash's account number 0595563 correction motion, decreasing the\r\nappraised value of the property from $409,400 to $189,390 to reflect interstate\r\nallocations.</span><span></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn May of 2003, Blue Flash received a 2002 tax statement for account number\r\n0950209 (the leased vehicles).  On September 5, 2003, the City of La Porte and La\r\nPorte Independent School District filed a suit to collect delinquent taxes against Blue\r\nFlash, alleging that taxes were due to them for tax year 2002 on account number\r\n0950209.  Harris County, Harris County Education Department, Port of Houston\r\nAuthority of Harris County, Harris County Flood Control District, Harris County\r\nHospital District, and San Jacinto Community College District </span><span></span><span>intervened in the City\r\nof La Porte and La Porte Independent School District's delinquent tax suit against\r\nBlue Flash, each seeking to collect delinquent taxes for the tax year 2002.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn September 26, 2003, after the delinquency date for the 2002 taxes,<sup> (2)</sup> Blue\r\nFlash filed a correction motion under section 25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code\r\nwith the Board to correct account number 0950209 (\"the account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion\")</span><span>  for tax years 2002 and 2003.  The account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion alleged  that Blue Flash was seeking a correction because its\r\nproperty was over-appraised by more than one-third, explaining, \"These are leased\r\nvehicles that are used about 1/2  [of the] time out of state &amp; need to be prorated for\r\ntime/use in Texas.\"  That motion also requested that the Board schedule a hearing to\r\ndecide whether to correct the alleged error in the appraisal roll.  On November 7,\r\n2003, the Board issued a notice denying Blue Flash's account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion for the 2002 tax year because neither the Board nor the District had\r\nthe legal authority to change the appraisal roll upon a motion filed after the\r\ndelinquency date for the 2002 tax year.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span>  </span><span>However, in a separate notice dated\r\nNovember 20, 2003, the Board granted Blue Flash's account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion for the 2003 tax year.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span> </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn May 10, 2004, Blue Flash filed its third-party petition against the District\r\nand Board in the Taxing Entities' collection suit, alleging that it had been denied due\r\nprocess of rights because the District and Board had failed to provide it proper notice\r\nof account number 0950209 under section 25.19 of the Texas Property Tax Code, that\r\nthe District and Board had over-appraised its property and were attempting to assess\r\nvalue and to tax property improperly, and that the District and Board were aware of\r\nerrors, but refused to correct them.  Blue Flash alleged that it was entitled to a\r\nmandatory injunction compelling the District and Board to correct the 2002 appraisal\r\nroll to reflect the proper appraised value of its property and to refund to Blue Flash\r\nany excess taxes paid.  On October 28, 2005, Blue Flash amended its answer and\r\nthird-party petition, alleging that (1) account number 0950209 was a duplicate\r\naccount and that Blue Flash had been unlawfully double taxed on the same property;\r\n(2) Blue Flash had not received proper or valid notice of appraised value in\r\ncompliance with section 25.19 of the Texas Property Tax Code; (3) the values for\r\nBlue Flash's personal property were excessive because it was entitled to a partial\r\nexemption; (4) Blue Flash was wrongly denied an opportunity to comply with the\r\nadministrative review procedures of the Texas Property Tax Code</span><span></span><span>; and (5) Blue Flash\r\nwas wrongly denied the allocations ordered by the Board for the property on account\r\nnumber 0950209.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe District and Board filed their motion for partial summary judgment on the\r\ngrounds that Blue Flash had not exhausted its administrative remedies and, therefore,\r\nthe trial court lacked jurisdiction over Blue Flash's declaratory judgment cause of\r\naction against them.  The trial court denied the District and Board's motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment in an order dated April 10, 2006, reciting that the trial court had\r\njurisdiction and that material issues of fact existed.  Blue Flash filed its motion for\r\nsummary judgment on  the Taxing Entities' collection causes of action and its\r\ndeclaratory cause of action against the District and Board.<sup> (5)</sup>  In its motion for summary\r\njudgment, Blue Flash asserted that (1) it was excused from having to exhaust\r\nadministrative remedies before seeking judicial review because the District and Board\r\nacted outside of their statutory authority and took actions that amounted to a\r\ndeprivation of property and a violation of Blue Flash's due process rights and (2)</span><span> the\r\nappraisal roll was defective because Blue Flash was double taxed or entitled to a\r\npartial exemption</span><span>.  On May 30, 2006, the trial court granted Blue Flash's motion for\r\nsummary judgment, ordering that the District remove \"duplicate\" account number\r\n0950209 from the appraisal roll for the year 2002 and that the Taxing Entities refund\r\nall payments on account number 0950209 for the 2002 tax year.  The trial court's\r\nfinal judgment also included a recital that the Taxing Entities take nothing from Blue\r\nFlash as to their claim for taxes, penalty, interest, and attorney's fees on account\r\nnumber 0950209 for the tax year 2002. </span><span><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>The District and Board's Appeal</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their issues one and two, the District and Board argue that the trial court\r\nerred by denying their motion for partial summary judgment and by granting Blue\r\nFlash's motion for summary judgment because Blue Flash's failure to comply with\r\nthe administrative review procedures of the Texas Property Tax Code deprived the\r\ntrial court of jurisdiction.<sup> (6)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span><strong>A.\tStandard of Review and the Law</strong>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA motion for summary judgment may raise a challenge to a trial court's\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>City of Hedwig Vill. Planning &amp; Zoning Comm'n v.\r\nHoweth Invs., Inc.</em>, 73 S.W.3d 389, 391 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no\r\npet.).  A plaintiff bears the burden of alleging facts affirmatively showing that a trial\r\ncourt has subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>Tex. Dep't of Parks &amp; Wildlife v.

Ass'n of Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d at 446.  The question of\r\nwhether a trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim is one of law, and we\r\nthus review it de novo.  <em>See Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d at 226.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf an agency has exclusive jurisdiction to determine a matter, a litigant's failure\r\nto exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of the\r\nadministrative body's actions deprives the court of subject-matter jurisdiction over\r\nclaims within the body's exclusive jurisdiction, and the court must generally dismiss\r\nsuch claims without prejudice.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.171 (Vernon 2000);<em>\r\nSubaru of Am., Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc.</em>, 84 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2002);\r\n<em>see</em> Tex.

Taxing authorities have exclusive jurisdiction over\r\ntax disputes, and taxpayers must therefore exhaust their administrative remedies\r\nbefore seeking judicial review.  <em>See Gen. Elec.

Co.</em>,\r\n128 S.W.3d at 780;  <em>Mitchison v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 803 S.W.2d 769, 773\r\n(Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied).  In such a case, the purposes\r\nunderlying the exhaustion rule are not applicable, judicial and administrative\r\nefficiency are not served by waiting for remedies to be exhausted, and agency policies\r\nand expertise are irrelevant if the agency's final action will be a nullity.  <em>Lexington\r\nIns. Co.,</em> 128 S.W.3d at 780.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span></span><span>First, we consider Blue Flash's argument that the District and Board acted\r\noutside of their statutory authority by creating a duplicate account for property\r\nalready assessed and taxes paid in an existing account.  </span><span></span><span>The crux of Blue Flash's\r\nargument is that the District and Board made a mistake that should have been\r\ncorrected.  This is a complaint of \"getting it wrong,\" not of acting outside of statutory\r\nauthority.  <em>See Williams v. Houston Firemen's Relief &amp; Ret.Fund</em>, 121 S.W.3d 415,\r\n430 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.).  Blue Flash was entitled to\r\nprotest the District and Board's mistake, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the appraised value of its property in the\r\nallegedly duplicate account, under either chapter 41<sup> (8)</sup></span><span></span><span> or section 25.25<sup> (9)</sup> of the Texas\r\nProperty Tax Code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann.</span><span> §§ 25.25, 41.41 (Vernon 2001 &amp;\r\nSupp. 2006).  Blue Flash did not avail itself of either of these remedies.  Instead, Blue\r\nFlash filed the account number 0950209 correction motion for the 2002 tax year </span><span></span><span> to\r\ncorrect \"[p]roperty over-appraised by more than 1/3,\" not to correct multiple appraisal\r\naccounts.  <em>See id. </em>§ 25.25.  </span><span></span><span>Blue Flash was entitled to protest the allegedly duplicate\r\naccount within the administrative scheme, but it did not.  <em>See id. </em>§§ 25.25, 41.41. \r\nBlue Flash cannot now do so in court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tSecond, we consider Blue Flash's argument that the District and Board acted\r\noutside of their statutory authority by attempting to apply a newly created account\r\nretroactively</span><span></span><span> to prior tax years already closed.  </span><span></span><span>Blue Flash in essence contends that\r\nan increase in the appraised value after the tax roll had been certified was not\r\nauthorized by the Texas Property Tax Code; thus, the District and Board acted\r\nwithout statutory authority when they established account number 0950209 for the\r\nleased vehicles.   Section 25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code prohibits the District\r\nand Board from changing the appraisal roll after it is certified unless (1) Blue Flash\r\nfiles a chapter protest or a corresponding chapter 42 lawsuit or (2) a correction motion\r\nis filed under section 25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code.  <em>See id. </em>§ 25.25. \r\nHowever, section 25.21 of the Texas Property Tax Code permits the chief appraiser\r\nto include omitted property in the appraisal records at any time:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t(a) If the chief appraiser discovers that real property was\r\nomitted from an appraisal roll in any one of the five\r\npreceding years or that personal property was omitted from\r\nan appraisal roll in one of the two preceding years, he shall\r\nappraise the property as of January 1 of each year that it\r\nwas omitted and enter the property and its appraised value\r\nin the appraisal records.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(b) The entry shall show that the appraisal is for property\r\nthat was omitted from an appraisal roll in a prior year and\r\nshall indicate the year and the appraised value for each\r\nyear.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em> § 25.21 (Vernon 2001).  Section 25.23 specifically authorizes additions to the\r\nappraisal roll for \"supplemental appraisal records,\" such as previously omitted\r\nproperty.<sup> (10)</sup>  <em>See id.</em> § 25.23(a)(1) (Vernon 2001).  Therefore, the District and Board\r\nacted within their statutory authority when they assessed Blue Flash's additional tax\r\nreflecting allegedly omitted property.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThird, Blue Flash argues that the District and Board acted outside of their\r\nstatutory authority by failing to give notice of an assessment on the new account\r\n</span><span></span><span>number 0950209.  The crux of Blue Flash's argument is that the District and Board\r\ndid not deliver notice as required by section 25.19 of the Texas Property Tax Code.<sup> (11)</sup></span><span> \r\n</span><span>Section 25.23 of the Texas Property Tax Code provides that the chief appraiser shall\r\ndeliver notice as required under 25.19 as soon as practicable after determining the\r\nappraisal value of supplemental appraisal records.  <em>Id.</em> § 25.23(c).  The Texas\r\nProperty Tax Code allows a property owner to protest the failure of the appraisal\r\nreview board to give the proper notice to which a property owner is entitled.  <em>Id. </em>§\r\n41.411(a) (Vernon 2001).  Section 41.411 expressly grants the appraisal review board\r\njurisdiction to hear taxpayer complaints regarding lack of notice.<sup> (12)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  <em>Id.</em></span><span> § 41.411.  Blue\r\nFlash did not protest the failure of the appraisal review board to give it proper notice. \r\nThe crux of Blue Flash's argument is that the District and Board made a mistake by\r\nnot sending it notice of the new account.</span><span></span><span>  This is another complaint of \"getting it\r\nwrong,\" not of acting outside of statutory authority.  <em>See Williams</em>, 121 S.W.3d at\r\n430.  Blue Flash was entitled to protest administratively the failure of the Board to\r\ngive the proper notice, but it did not.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> § 41.411.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFourth, Blue Flash argues that the District and Board acted outside of their\r\nstatutory authority by not recognizing or complying with their own \"final orders.\" \r\nBlue Flash does not explain with which of their \"own final orders\" the District and\r\nBoard have failed to comply.  The record reflects that the District and Board issued\r\nthree determinations related to this appeal: (1) an order granting Blue Flash's account\r\nnumber 0595563 correction motion for the 2001 and 2002 tax years, which decreased\r\nthe appraised values to reflect interstate allocations; (2) a notice denying Blue Flash's\r\nnumber 0950209 correction motion for the 2002 tax year because neither the Board\r\nnor the District had the legal authority to change the appraisal roll upon a motion filed\r\nafter the delinquency date for the 2002 tax year;<sup> (13)</sup></span><span> and (3) </span><span>a \"notice of approval\"\r\ngranting Blue Flash's account number 0950209 correction motion for the 2003 tax\r\nyear, which decreased the appraised values to reflect interstate allocations</span><span></span><span>.  We\r\ninterpret Blue Flash's argument to be that because the District and Board issued a\r\nnotice decreasing the appraised values to reflect interstate allocations for the same\r\nproperty and on the same account in the 2003 tax year, the District and Board were\r\nacting outside of their authority when the same property was over-appraised and not\r\ncorrected for the 2002 tax year for account number 0950209.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBlue Flash was entitled to protest the District and Board's alleged mistake, <em>i.e.</em>,<em>\r\n</em>the over-appraised value of its property for the 2002 tax year for account number\r\n0950209, under either chapter 41 or section 25.25<sup> (14)</sup> of the Texas Property Tax Code. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann.</span><span> §§ 25.25, 41.41(a).  However, Blue Flash did not protest\r\nthe over-appraised value of its property under chapter 41 or timely file its account\r\nnumber 0950209 correction motion </span><span></span><span>before the 2002 taxes became delinquent. \r\nMoreover, the District and Board had the statutory authority to assess Blue Flash's\r\nadditional tax reflecting allegedly omitted property</span><span></span><span> and had no authority to correct the\r\n2002 appraisal rolls absent a section 25.25 or 41.41 challenge.  <em>See</em> <em>id. </em>§§ 25.25(d),\r\n41.41. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLastly, Blue Flash argues that the District and Board acted outside of their\r\nstatutory authority by failing to conduct a statutorily required hearing.  Blue Flash\r\ncontends that on September 26, 2003, it filed a written request for a hearing before\r\nthe Board on its account number 0950209 correction motion for tax year 2002.  Blue\r\nFlash's request for a hearing was made in its section 25.25 motion to correct, which \r\nwas a fill-in-the-blank form and which included the following,  form-typed text: \"I\r\nrequest the Appraisal Review Board (ARB) schedule a hearing to decide whether or\r\nnot to correct the error in the appraisal roll.  I request that the Appraisal Review\r\nBoard send notice of the time, date, and place fixed for the hearing, not later than 15\r\ndays before the scheduled hearing.\"  In its November 7 notice denying Blue Flash's\r\naccount number 0950209 correction motion for its 2002 taxes,  the Board advised\r\nBlue Flash that it was entitled to a hearing before the Board even though the only\r\naction that the Board could take would be to dismiss its \"appeal for lack of\r\njurisdiction.\"  The notice further explained that the Board was withdrawing Blue\r\nFlash's motion from consideration and that if Blue Flash wished to proceed to a\r\nformal hearing to present its appeal, it should contact the Board in writing within 15\r\ndays of the date of the letter.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe crux of Blue Flash's argument again is that the District and Board made\r\na mistake by failing to hold a hearing.  This is another complaint of \"getting it\r\nwrong,\" not of acting outside of statutory authority.  <em>See Williams</em>, 121 S.W.3d at\r\n430.  Blue Flash could have pursued its administrative remedy to correct the Board's\r\nfailure to hold that hearing, but it did not.  There is no evidence in the record that\r\nBlue Flash followed the instructions in the November 7 notice by contacting the\r\nBoard in writing within 15 days of the date of that notice, nor does Blue Flash\r\ncontend that it sent any such written request after it had received that notice.  Further,\r\nhad the Board denied Blue Flash a hearing properly requested after the date of the\r\nletter, Blue Flash would have been entitled to bring suit against the appraisal review\r\nboard by filing a petition or application in district court to compel the Board to\r\nprovide the hearing.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 25.25(m) (providing that hearing\r\non motion under section 25.25 be conducted in manner provided by chapter 41 of the\r\nTexas Property Tax Code); <em>see also id. </em>§ </span><span></span><span>41.45(f) (Vernon 2001) (stating that\r\nproperty owner who has been denied hearing to which he is entitled may bring suit\r\nagainst appraisal review board by filing petition or application in district court to\r\ncompel board to provide hearing).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we hold that the acting-outside-of-statutory exception did not \r\napply to excuse Blue Flash from exhausting its administrative remedies before\r\nseeking judicial review of the District and Boards actions.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.\tExceptions: Constitutional Issues Involved and Failure to Provide\r\nNotice </strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Blue Flash further contends that because the District and Board did not provide\r\nit with proper notice or a meaningful opportunity to dispute the Board's action, Blue\r\nFlash was deprived of notice and due process.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Collection of a tax constitutes a deprivation of property;  accordingly, a taxing\r\nunit must afford a property owner due process of law and must provide meaningful,\r\nbackward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation.  <em>McKesson Corp.\r\nv.

At a\r\nminimum, due process in this context requires notice and a fair opportunity to be\r\nheard before a taxpayer is deprived of a protected property interest.  <em>McKesson</em>, 496\r\nU.S. at 37, 110 S.

In tax cases,\r\nTexas courts have held that due process is satisfied if the taxpayer is given an\r\nopportunity to be heard before an assessment board at some stage of the proceedings.\r\n<em>Id.</em>; <em> Denton Cent.

CI.T Leasing Corp.</em>, 115 S.W.3d 261, 266 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Firmly rooted in Texas jurisprudence is a constitutional-claim exception to the\r\nexhaustion-of-administrative-remedies doctrine.  <em>E.g., Fisher</em>, 88 S.W.3d at 813\r\n(holding that taxpayer was denied due process and any taxes assessed from appraisal\r\nwere void because evidence that taxpayer neither received notice nor had opportunity\r\nto contest appraisal was undisputed); <em>Gibson</em>, 971 S.W.2d at 202-03 (holding that\r\nchallengers of school district's new policy did not have to exhaust administrative\r\nremedies before filing constitutional challenge because Texas Education Code did not\r\nprovide administrative appeal for state or federal constitutional challenges to\r\ndecisions of school board).  The constitutional-claim exception to the exhaustion-of-administrative-remedies doctrine was created to protect property owners from the loss\r\nof property without an opportunity to be heard at the administrative level and without\r\nrecourse to judicial review.  <em>See CIT Leasing</em>, 115 S.W.3d at 266.   Before the\r\nenactment of section 41.411, the property tax scheme did not provide taxpayers with\r\nadequate remedies at law to cure defective notice.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em>; <em>see, e.g.</em>, <em>Harris County\r\nAppraisal Dist. v. Dincans</em>, 882 S.W.2d 75, 79 (Tex.

Gen. Elec.\r\nCorp.</em>, 819 S.W.2d 915, 919 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied). \r\n</span><span></span><span>Assuming without deciding that the District and Board did not send Blue Flash the\r\nnotice to which it was entitled, the Texas Property Tax Code provided Blue Flash\r\nwith administrative procedures specifically created to allow it to protest defective\r\nnotice of such actions and to protest improper actions that the District and Board took\r\nadverse to Blue Flash's interests.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 41.41, 41.411.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs discussed in the section above, Blue Flash was provided with statutory\r\nadministrative remedies under which it could have protested objectionable District\r\nand Board actions, but chose not to avail itself of the administrative remedies.  <em>See\r\nid. </em>§§ 25.25, 41.41(a), 41.411(a).  Because Blue Flash was presented with an\r\nopportunity to be heard, deprivations of property that stem from account number\r\n0950209 for the 2002 tax year are not unconstitutional.  We hold that Blue Flash\r\nreceived the process that it was due when it was afforded an opportunity to protest\r\ndefective notice and to be heard on the merits of its tax dispute during the\r\nadministrative process.  The constitutional-claims exception thus did not excuse Blue\r\nFlash from exhausting its administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tConclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have already held that none of the exceptions that Blue Flash asserted on\r\nappeal to the exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine applies to except Blue Flash from\r\npursuing its administrative remedies.  Blue Flash failed to exhaust all administrative\r\nremedies before seeking judicial review of the District and Board's complained-of\r\nactions.  Consequently, the district court was deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nover Blue Flash's third-party claim against the District and Board because that claim\r\nfell within the administrative body's exclusive jurisdiction.  The district court erred\r\nby denying the District and Board's partial summary judgment motion to dismiss for\r\nwant of jurisdiction Blue Flash's cause of action against them and by granting Blue\r\nFlash's motion for summary judgment.  We sustain the District and Board's issues\r\none and two.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>The Taxing Entities' Appeal</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In two points of error, the Taxing Entities argue that the trial court erred by\r\ngranting Blue Flash's motion for summary judgment in their delinquent tax suit\r\nagainst it.  Specifically, in issue one, the Taxing Entities argue that the trial court\r\nerred because Blue Flash did not prove as a matter of law that it was double-taxed or\r\nentitled to a partial exemption.  In issue two, the Taxing Entities argue that  the trial\r\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Blue Flash because Blue Flash\r\ndid not exhaust its administrative remedies, nor was it </span><span>excused from having to do so;\r\nthus, </span><span>the trial court was deprived of jurisdiction to consider Blue Flash's affirmative\r\ndefenses protesting its property's inclusion on the appraisal records.<strong>A. \tStandard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>Our review of a summary judgment is de novo.  <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins.\r\nCo. v. Knott</em>, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003).  Under the traditional standard for\r\nsummary judgment, a movant has the burden to show that no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact exists and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n166a(c); <em>KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp., </em>988 S.W.2d\r\n746, 748 (Tex. 1999).  We view all evidence in a light favorable to the non-movant\r\nand indulge every reasonable inference in the non-movant's favor. <em> Knott</em>, 128\r\nS.W.3d at 215.  A defendant moving for summary judgment on an affirmative defense\r\nmust prove each element of its defense as a matter of law, leaving no issues of\r\nmaterial fact.  <em>Garza v. Exel Logistics, Inc.</em>, 161 S.W.3d 473, 475 n.10 (Tex. 2005)\r\n(citing <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson Med., Inc. v.

Specifically, Blue Flash argued that it was entitled to summary\r\njudgment on its affirmative defense because it was double-taxed or, alternatively, it\r\nwas partially exempted from the tax.  The Taxing Entities did not move for summary\r\njudgment on their delinquent tax suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe recognize that the trial court has jurisdiction over the Taxing Entities'\r\ncollection suit against Blue Flash.  <em>See </em>Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.41(a) (Vernon\r\n2001) (stating that at any time after tax on property becomes delinquent, taxing unit\r\nmay file suit to foreclose lien securing payment of tax, to enforce personal liability\r\nfor tax, or both.)  </span><span></span><span>However, the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nover Blue Flash's affirmative defense that the appraisals on which the Taxing\r\nEntities' delinquent tax suit was based were defective</span><span></span><span>.  <em>See Northwest Tex.\r\nConference of United Methodist Church v. Happy Indep. Sch.Dist</em>., 839 S.W.2d 140,\r\n143 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1992, no writ) (holding that failure of taxpayer to pursue\r\nremedies established in Texas Property Tax Code to protest property's inclusion on\r\nappraisal records deprived trial court of jurisdiction to consider taxpayer's defense\r\nthat property was exempt); <em>see also</em>  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 42.09 (a) (Vernon 2001)\r\n(</span><span></span><span>stating that  procedures prescribed by Texas Property Tax Code provide exclusive\r\nremedies for adjudicating the grounds of protest authorized by the Texas Property\r\nTax Code and that property owner may not raise any of these grounds as basis for\r\nrelief in defense to suit to enforce collection of delinquent taxes).  We have already\r\nheld that </span><span>Blue Flash did not exhaust its administrative remedies, nor was it </span><span>excused\r\nfrom having to do so; thus, the district court was deprived of subject-matter\r\njurisdiction to determine whether Blue Flash was double-taxed, or whether it was\r\npartially exempted from the tax.  Blue Flash thus did not carry its summary-judgment\r\nburden.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span></span><span>Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred by granting Blue Flash's motion\r\nfor summary judgment against the Taxing Entities because the trial court was\r\njurisdictionally prohibited, for the reasons stated above, from considering Blue\r\nFlash's defense, raised in its motion for summary judgment, that the appraisal roll was\r\ndefective.<strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>We reverse the judgment. We render judgment that Blue Flash's third-party\r\nclaim against the District and Board be dismissed without prejudice for lack of\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  We remand the cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tTim Taft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Panel consists of Justices Taft, Alcala, and Hanks</span><span>.\t\r\n<p>1. \tThe Taxing Entities did not file a motion for summary judgment seeking\r\naffirmative relief in the trial court.  Consequently, on appeal, the Taxing\r\nEntities request that this cause be remanded on their delinquent tax suit against\r\nBlue Flash.  \r\n</p><p>2. \tThe delinquency date for the 2002 taxes was February 1, 2003.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax\r\nCode Ann. § 31.02(a) (Vernon Supp. 2006) (stating that taxes are generally\r\ndue on receipt of tax bill and are delinquent if not paid before February 1 of\r\nfollowing tax year)</p></span><span>.\r\n<p>3. \tIn its November 7, 2003 notice, the Board advised Blue Flash that it was\r\nentitled to a hearing before the Board even though the only action that the\r\nBoard could take would be to dismiss its \"appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\"  The\r\ncorrespondence further explained that the Board was withdrawing Blue Flash's\r\nmotion from consideration and that if Blue Flash wished to proceed to a formal\r\nhearing to present its appeal, it should contact the Board in writing within 15\r\ndays of the date of the letter.  \t\r\n</p><p>4. \tThe record does not contain a copy of the November 20 notice.  However, none\r\nof the parties disputes that it was issued.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(f) (stating\r\nthat, in civil case, appellate court will accept as true facts by appellant stated\r\nunless another party contradicts them).\r\n</p><p>5. \tAlthough Blue Flash states in its brief that the City of La Porte and La Porte\r\nIndependent School District filed a motion for summary judgment, the record\r\non appeal does not reflect that any such motion was filed, nor do the City of La\r\nPorte and La Porte Independent School District contend that they filed a\r\nmotion for summary judgment on their collection cause of action against Blue\r\nFlash.</p></span><span>\r\n<p>6. \tThe Taxing Entities assert this argument on appeal, as well.  We discuss this\r\nargument's effect on their cause of action below.\r\n</p><p>7. \tBlue Flash also contends in its brief that the jurisdiction of the trial court has\r\nbeen invoked under section 42.01 of the Texas Property Tax Code, for which\r\nthere is not a deadline to seek appellate review. <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. §\r\n42.01 (Vernon 2001).  Section 42.01 applies to a taxpayer's right to appeal a\r\ndetermination of the appraisal review board.  <em>See id. </em> Blue Flash is not\r\nappealing any order or determination of the appraisal review board, but, rather,\r\nasserts that the appraisal roll is defective as an affirmative defense to the\r\nTaxing Entities' collection suit and as a declaratory judgment cause of action\r\nagainst the District and Board.  Although there is a determination on Blue\r\nFlash's account number 0950209 correction motion for the 2002 tax year based\r\non whether Blue Flash was entitled to an exemption, Blue Flash did not file a\r\nmotion to correct for the 2002 tax year based on whether account number\r\n0950209 was a duplicate account. </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, the Texas Property Tax Code has deadlines for appealing an order\r\nof the appraisal review board.  Section 42.06 provides that to exercise a right\r\nto appeal an order of an appraisal review board, a party must file written notice\r\nof appeal within 15 days after the date that the taxpayer received the notice.\r\n<em>See id</em>. § 42.06(a) (Vernon 2001).  Additionally, section 25.25 provides that\r\nwithin 45 days after receiving notice of the appraisal review board's\r\ndetermination the taxpayer may file suit to compel the board to order a change\r\nin the appraisal roll.  <em>See id</em>.</span><span></span><span> § 25.25(g) (Vernon Supp. 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\r\n<p>8. \tSection 41.41(a)(9) of the Texas Property Tax Code specifies that property\r\nowners are entitled to protest any action of the chief appraiser, appraisal\r\ndistrict, or appraisal review board that applies to and adversely affects the\r\nproperty owner.  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 41.41(a)(9) (Vernon 2001).   A\r\nprotest under section 41.41 must be filed no later than June 1 or the thirtieth\r\nday after the notice of appraised value is delivered to the property owner,\r\nwhichever is later.  <em>Id. </em>§ 41.44(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2006).\r\n</p><p>9. \tUnder section 25.25(c) of the Texas Property Tax Code, a property owner is\r\ngiven up to five years to request that the appraisal review board change the\r\nappraisal roll to correct (1) clerical errors, (2) multiple appraisals, or (3) the\r\ninclusion of property that does not exist in the form or at the location described\r\nin the appraisal roll.  Tex. Tax Code Ann.</p></span><span></span><span> § 25.25 (c).  The purpose of section\r\n25.25(c) is to allow late changes to otherwise finalized appraisal records only\r\nin situations in which \"the decision to make the change is based on an\r\nobjective, factual determination and the payment of taxes based on the\r\nuncorrected records would be fundamentally unfair.\"  <em>GE Capital Corp. v.\r\nDallas Cent. Appraisal Dist.</em>, 971 S.W.2d 591, 593 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1998,\r\nno pet.).</span><span>\t \t\r\n<p>10. \tSection 31.04(a-1) of the Texas Property Tax Code provides specific\r\nguidelines for when tax bills become delinquent if the bill includes property\r\nthat was erroneously omitted.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. </p></span><span></span><span>§ 31.04(a-1) (Vernon\r\nSupp. 2006).  If a tax bill is mailed and it includes taxes for one or more\r\npreceding tax years because the property was erroneously omitted from the tax\r\nroll in those tax years, the delinquency date that is provided by section 31.02\r\nis postponed to February 1 of the first year that will provide a period of at least\r\n180 days after the date that the tax bill is mailed in which to pay the taxes\r\nbefore they become delinquent.  <em>Id.</em></span><span>\t \r\n<p>11. \tThe Taxing Authorities are required to provide property owners notice in\r\nwriting.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 25.19(a), (b), (g), (h), (j) (Vernon Supp.\r\n2006).  The notice must cite appraised property value, segregate real and\r\npersonal property appraisals, and provide a detailed explanation of the time and\r\nprocedure for protesting the appraisal value.  <em>Id</em>. Supplemental appraisal\r\nrecords are the proper way to add omitted property to the appraisal roll, subject\r\nto review, protest, and appeal under chapters 41 and 42 of the Texas Property\r\nTax Code.  <em>Id.</em> § 25.23(a)(1), (d) (Vernon 2001).   \r\n</p><p>12. \tIn addition, the Texas Property Tax Code  expressly provides that a taxpayer's\r\nfailure to receive notice does not affect the validity of the appraisal or \"the\r\nimposition of any tax on the basis of the appraisal.\"  Tex. Tax Code Ann. §\r\n25.19(d); <em>Denton Cent. Appraisal Dist. v. CIT Leasing, Corp.</em>, 115 S.W.3d 261,\r\n265 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied); <em>Dallas County Appraisal Dist.\r\nv.

Tax Code Ann. § 25.25.  To the contrary, section 25.25(g) provides that\r\na property owner may file suit to compel the board to order a change to the\r\nappraisal roll within 45 days after receiving <em>notice</em> of the appraisal review\r\nboard's determination.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> § 25.25(g).\r\n</p><p>14. \tSection 25.25(d) of the Texas Property Tax Code provides, \"At any time prior\r\nto the date the taxes become delinquent, a property owner or the chief appraiser\r\nmay file a motion with the appraisal review board to change the appraisal roll\r\nto correct an error that resulted in an incorrect appraised value for the owner's\r\nproperty.  However, the error may not be corrected unless it resulted in an\r\nappraised value that exceeds by more than one-third the correct appraised\r\nvalue.\"  Tex.

Blue Flash listed a total of 67 vehicles, which included both vehicles that\r\nit had owned and vehicles that it had leased.  The District listed the vehicles under\r\ntwo accounts: account number 0595563, which included the 33 vehicles that Blue\r\nFlash owned, and 0950209, which included the 34 vehicles that Blue Flash leased. \r\nOn January 1, 2003, Blue Flash paid the taxes on account number 0595563 (the\r\nowned vehicles), but not on account number 0950209 (the leased vehicles).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2003, Blue Flash filed with the Board a correction motion under section\r\n25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code to correct account number 0595563 (\"the\r\naccount number 0595563 correction motion\") for the 2001 and 2002 tax years.  The\r\naccount number 0595563 correction motion alleged that the property had been over-appraised by more than one third for both of these years.  The Board issued an order\r\ngranting Blue Flash's account number 0595563 correction motion, decreasing the\r\nappraised value of the property from $409,400 to $189,390 to reflect interstate\r\nallocations.</span><span></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn May of 2003, Blue Flash received a 2002 tax statement for account number\r\n0950209 (the leased vehicles).  On September 5, 2003, the City of La Porte and La\r\nPorte Independent School District filed a suit to collect delinquent taxes against Blue\r\nFlash, alleging that taxes were due to them for tax year 2002 on account number\r\n0950209.  Harris County, Harris County Education Department, Port of Houston\r\nAuthority of Harris County, Harris County Flood Control District, Harris County\r\nHospital District, and San Jacinto Community College District </span><span></span><span>intervened in the City\r\nof La Porte and La Porte Independent School District's delinquent tax suit against\r\nBlue Flash, each seeking to collect delinquent taxes for the tax year 2002.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn September 26, 2003, after the delinquency date for the 2002 taxes,<sup> (2)</sup> Blue\r\nFlash filed a correction motion under section 25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code\r\nwith the Board to correct account number 0950209 (\"the account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion\")</span><span>  for tax years 2002 and 2003.  The account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion alleged  that Blue Flash was seeking a correction because its\r\nproperty was over-appraised by more than one-third, explaining, \"These are leased\r\nvehicles that are used about 1/2  [of the] time out of state &amp; need to be prorated for\r\ntime/use in Texas.\"  That motion also requested that the Board schedule a hearing to\r\ndecide whether to correct the alleged error in the appraisal roll.  On November 7,\r\n2003, the Board issued a notice denying Blue Flash's account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion for the 2002 tax year because neither the Board nor the District had\r\nthe legal authority to change the appraisal roll upon a motion filed after the\r\ndelinquency date for the 2002 tax year.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span>  </span><span>However, in a separate notice dated\r\nNovember 20, 2003, the Board granted Blue Flash's account number 0950209\r\ncorrection motion for the 2003 tax year.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span> </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn May 10, 2004, Blue Flash filed its third-party petition against the District\r\nand Board in the Taxing Entities' collection suit, alleging that it had been denied due\r\nprocess of rights because the District and Board had failed to provide it proper notice\r\nof account number 0950209 under section 25.19 of the Texas Property Tax Code, that\r\nthe District and Board had over-appraised its property and were attempting to assess\r\nvalue and to tax property improperly, and that the District and Board were aware of\r\nerrors, but refused to correct them.  Blue Flash alleged that it was entitled to a\r\nmandatory injunction compelling the District and Board to correct the 2002 appraisal\r\nroll to reflect the proper appraised value of its property and to refund to Blue Flash\r\nany excess taxes paid.  On October 28, 2005, Blue Flash amended its answer and\r\nthird-party petition, alleging that (1) account number 0950209 was a duplicate\r\naccount and that Blue Flash had been unlawfully double taxed on the same property;\r\n(2) Blue Flash had not received proper or valid notice of appraised value in\r\ncompliance with section 25.19 of the Texas Property Tax Code; (3) the values for\r\nBlue Flash's personal property were excessive because it was entitled to a partial\r\nexemption; (4) Blue Flash was wrongly denied an opportunity to comply with the\r\nadministrative review procedures of the Texas Property Tax Code</span><span></span><span>; and (5) Blue Flash\r\nwas wrongly denied the allocations ordered by the Board for the property on account\r\nnumber 0950209.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe District and Board filed their motion for partial summary judgment on the\r\ngrounds that Blue Flash had not exhausted its administrative remedies and, therefore,\r\nthe trial court lacked jurisdiction over Blue Flash's declaratory judgment cause of\r\naction against them.  The trial court denied the District and Board's motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment in an order dated April 10, 2006, reciting that the trial court had\r\njurisdiction and that material issues of fact existed.  Blue Flash filed its motion for\r\nsummary judgment on  the Taxing Entities' collection causes of action and its\r\ndeclaratory cause of action against the District and Board.<sup> (5)</sup>  In its motion for summary\r\njudgment, Blue Flash asserted that (1) it was excused from having to exhaust\r\nadministrative remedies before seeking judicial review because the District and Board\r\nacted outside of their statutory authority and took actions that amounted to a\r\ndeprivation of property and a violation of Blue Flash's due process rights and (2)</span><span> the\r\nappraisal roll was defective because Blue Flash was double taxed or entitled to a\r\npartial exemption</span><span>.  On May 30, 2006, the trial court granted Blue Flash's motion for\r\nsummary judgment, ordering that the District remove \"duplicate\" account number\r\n0950209 from the appraisal roll for the year 2002 and that the Taxing Entities refund\r\nall payments on account number 0950209 for the 2002 tax year.  The trial court's\r\nfinal judgment also included a recital that the Taxing Entities take nothing from Blue\r\nFlash as to their claim for taxes, penalty, interest, and attorney's fees on account\r\nnumber 0950209 for the tax year 2002. </span><span><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>The District and Board's Appeal</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their issues one and two, the District and Board argue that the trial court\r\nerred by denying their motion for partial summary judgment and by granting Blue\r\nFlash's motion for summary judgment because Blue Flash's failure to comply with\r\nthe administrative review procedures of the Texas Property Tax Code deprived the\r\ntrial court of jurisdiction.<sup> (6)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span><strong>A.\tStandard of Review and the Law</strong>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA motion for summary judgment may raise a challenge to a trial court's\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>City of Hedwig Vill.

Blue Flash was entitled to\r\nprotest the District and Board's mistake, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the appraised value of its property in the\r\nallegedly duplicate account, under either chapter 41<sup> (8)</sup></span><span></span><span> or section 25.25<sup> (9)</sup> of the Texas\r\nProperty Tax Code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann.</span><span> §§ 25.25, 41.41 (Vernon 2001 &amp;\r\nSupp. 2006).  Blue Flash did not avail itself of either of these remedies.

Section 25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code prohibits the District\r\nand Board from changing the appraisal roll after it is certified unless (1) Blue Flash\r\nfiles a chapter protest or a corresponding chapter 42 lawsuit or (2) a correction motion\r\nis filed under section 25.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code.  <em>See id. </em>§ 25.25. \r\nHowever, section 25.21 of the Texas Property Tax Code permits the chief appraiser\r\nto include omitted property in the appraisal records at any time:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t(a) If the chief appraiser discovers that real property was\r\nomitted from an appraisal roll in any one of the five\r\npreceding years or that personal property was omitted from\r\nan appraisal roll in one of the two preceding years, he shall\r\nappraise the property as of January 1 of each year that it\r\nwas omitted and enter the property and its appraised value\r\nin the appraisal records.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(b) The entry shall show that the appraisal is for property\r\nthat was omitted from an appraisal roll in a prior year and\r\nshall indicate the year and the appraised value for each\r\nyear.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em> § 25.21 (Vernon 2001).  Section 25.23 specifically authorizes additions to the\r\nappraisal roll for \"supplemental appraisal records,\" such as previously omitted\r\nproperty.<sup> (10)</sup>  <em>See id.</em> § 25.23(a)(1) (Vernon 2001).  Therefore, the District and Board\r\nacted within their statutory authority when they assessed Blue Flash's additional tax\r\nreflecting allegedly omitted property.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThird, Blue Flash argues that the District and Board acted outside of their\r\nstatutory authority by failing to give notice of an assessment on the new account\r\n</span><span></span><span>number 0950209.  The crux of Blue Flash's argument is that the District and Board\r\ndid not deliver notice as required by section 25.19 of the Texas Property Tax Code.<sup> (11)</sup></span><span> \r\n</span><span>Section 25.23 of the Texas Property Tax Code provides that the chief appraiser shall\r\ndeliver notice as required under 25.19 as soon as practicable after determining the\r\nappraisal value of supplemental appraisal records.  <em>Id.</em> § 25.23(c).  The Texas\r\nProperty Tax Code allows a property owner to protest the failure of the appraisal\r\nreview board to give the proper notice to which a property owner is entitled.  <em>Id. </em>§\r\n41.411(a) (Vernon 2001).  Section 41.411 expressly grants the appraisal review board\r\njurisdiction to hear taxpayer complaints regarding lack of notice.<sup> (12)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  <em>Id.</em></span><span> § 41.411.  Blue\r\nFlash did not protest the failure of the appraisal review board to give it proper notice. \r\nThe crux of Blue Flash's argument is that the District and Board made a mistake by\r\nnot sending it notice of the new account.</span><span></span><span>  This is another complaint of \"getting it\r\nwrong,\" not of acting outside of statutory authority.  <em>See Williams</em>, 121 S.W.3d at\r\n430.  Blue Flash was entitled to protest administratively the failure of the Board to\r\ngive the proper notice, but it did not.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> § 41.411.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFourth, Blue Flash argues that the District and Board acted outside of their\r\nstatutory authority by not recognizing or complying with their own \"final orders.\" \r\nBlue Flash does not explain with which of their \"own final orders\" the District and\r\nBoard have failed to comply.  The record reflects that the District and Board issued\r\nthree determinations related to this appeal: (1) an order granting Blue Flash's account\r\nnumber 0595563 correction motion for the 2001 and 2002 tax years, which decreased\r\nthe appraised values to reflect interstate allocations; (2) a notice denying Blue Flash's\r\nnumber 0950209 correction motion for the 2002 tax year because neither the Board\r\nnor the District had the legal authority to change the appraisal roll upon a motion filed\r\nafter the delinquency date for the 2002 tax year;<sup> (13)</sup></span><span> and (3) </span><span>a \"notice of approval\"\r\ngranting Blue Flash's account number 0950209 correction motion for the 2003 tax\r\nyear, which decreased the appraised values to reflect interstate allocations</span><span></span><span>.  We\r\ninterpret Blue Flash's argument to be that because the District and Board issued a\r\nnotice decreasing the appraised values to reflect interstate allocations for the same\r\nproperty and on the same account in the 2003 tax year, the District and Board were\r\nacting outside of their authority when the same property was over-appraised and not\r\ncorrected for the 2002 tax year for account number 0950209.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBlue Flash was entitled to protest the District and Board's alleged mistake, <em>i.e.</em>,<em>\r\n</em>the over-appraised value of its property for the 2002 tax year for account number\r\n0950209, under either chapter 41 or section 25.25<sup> (14)</sup> of the Texas Property Tax Code. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann.</span><span> §§ 25.25, 41.41(a).  However, Blue Flash did not protest\r\nthe over-appraised value of its property under chapter 41 or timely file its account\r\nnumber 0950209 correction motion </span><span></span><span>before the 2002 taxes became delinquent. \r\nMoreover, the District and Board had the statutory authority to assess Blue Flash's\r\nadditional tax reflecting allegedly omitted property</span><span></span><span> and had no authority to correct the\r\n2002 appraisal rolls absent a section 25.25 or 41.41 challenge.  <em>See</em> <em>id. </em>§§ 25.25(d),\r\n41.41. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLastly, Blue Flash argues that the District and Board acted outside of their\r\nstatutory authority by failing to conduct a statutorily required hearing.  Blue Flash\r\ncontends that on September 26, 2003, it filed a written request for a hearing before\r\nthe Board on its account number 0950209 correction motion for tax year 2002.  Blue\r\nFlash's request for a hearing was made in its section 25.25 motion to correct, which \r\nwas a fill-in-the-blank form and which included the following,  form-typed text: \"I\r\nrequest the Appraisal Review Board (ARB) schedule a hearing to decide whether or\r\nnot to correct the error in the appraisal roll.  I request that the Appraisal Review\r\nBoard send notice of the time, date, and place fixed for the hearing, not later than 15\r\ndays before the scheduled hearing.\"  In its November 7 notice denying Blue Flash's\r\naccount number 0950209 correction motion for its 2002 taxes,  the Board advised\r\nBlue Flash that it was entitled to a hearing before the Board even though the only\r\naction that the Board could take would be to dismiss its \"appeal for lack of\r\njurisdiction.\"  The notice further explained that the Board was withdrawing Blue\r\nFlash's motion from consideration and that if Blue Flash wished to proceed to a\r\nformal hearing to present its appeal, it should contact the Board in writing within 15\r\ndays of the date of the letter.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe crux of Blue Flash's argument again is that the District and Board made\r\na mistake by failing to hold a hearing.  This is another complaint of \"getting it\r\nwrong,\" not of acting outside of statutory authority.  <em>See Williams</em>, 121 S.W.3d at\r\n430.  Blue Flash could have pursued its administrative remedy to correct the Board's\r\nfailure to hold that hearing, but it did not.  There is no evidence in the record that\r\nBlue Flash followed the instructions in the November 7 notice by contacting the\r\nBoard in writing within 15 days of the date of that notice, nor does Blue Flash\r\ncontend that it sent any such written request after it had received that notice.  Further,\r\nhad the Board denied Blue Flash a hearing properly requested after the date of the\r\nletter, Blue Flash would have been entitled to bring suit against the appraisal review\r\nboard by filing a petition or application in district court to compel the Board to\r\nprovide the hearing.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 25.25(m) (providing that hearing\r\non motion under section 25.25 be conducted in manner provided by chapter 41 of the\r\nTexas Property Tax Code); <em>see also id. </em>§ </span><span></span><span>41.45(f) (Vernon 2001) (stating that\r\nproperty owner who has been denied hearing to which he is entitled may bring suit\r\nagainst appraisal review board by filing petition or application in district court to\r\ncompel board to provide hearing).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we hold that the acting-outside-of-statutory exception did not \r\napply to excuse Blue Flash from exhausting its administrative remedies before\r\nseeking judicial review of the District and Boards actions.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.\tExceptions: Constitutional Issues Involved and Failure to Provide\r\nNotice </strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Blue Flash further contends that because the District and Board did not provide\r\nit with proper notice or a meaningful opportunity to dispute the Board's action, Blue\r\nFlash was deprived of notice and due process.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Collection of a tax constitutes a deprivation of property;  accordingly, a taxing\r\nunit must afford a property owner due process of law and must provide meaningful,\r\nbackward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation.  <em>McKesson Corp.\r\nv.

Tax Code Ann. §§ 41.41, 41.411.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs discussed in the section above, Blue Flash was provided with statutory\r\nadministrative remedies under which it could have protested objectionable District\r\nand Board actions, but chose not to avail itself of the administrative remedies.  <em>See\r\nid. </em>§§ 25.25, 41.41(a), 41.411(a).  Because Blue Flash was presented with an\r\nopportunity to be heard, deprivations of property that stem from account number\r\n0950209 for the 2002 tax year are not unconstitutional.  We hold that Blue Flash\r\nreceived the process that it was due when it was afforded an opportunity to protest\r\ndefective notice and to be heard on the merits of its tax dispute during the\r\nadministrative process.  The constitutional-claims exception thus did not excuse Blue\r\nFlash from exhausting its administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tConclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have already held that none of the exceptions that Blue Flash asserted on\r\nappeal to the exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine applies to except Blue Flash from\r\npursuing its administrative remedies.  Blue Flash failed to exhaust all administrative\r\nremedies before seeking judicial review of the District and Board's complained-of\r\nactions.  Consequently, the district court was deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nover Blue Flash's third-party claim against the District and Board because that claim\r\nfell within the administrative body's exclusive jurisdiction.  The district court erred\r\nby denying the District and Board's partial summary judgment motion to dismiss for\r\nwant of jurisdiction Blue Flash's cause of action against them and by granting Blue\r\nFlash's motion for summary judgment.

App. P. 38.1(f) (stating\r\nthat, in civil case, appellate court will accept as true facts by appellant stated\r\nunless another party contradicts them).\r\n</p><p>5. \tAlthough Blue Flash states in its brief that the City of La Porte and La Porte\r\nIndependent School District filed a motion for summary judgment, the record\r\non appeal does not reflect that any such motion was filed, nor do the City of La\r\nPorte and La Porte Independent School District contend that they filed a\r\nmotion for summary judgment on their collection cause of action against Blue\r\nFlash.</p></span><span>\r\n<p>6. \tThe Taxing Entities assert this argument on appeal, as well.  We discuss this\r\nargument's effect on their cause of action below.\r\n</p><p>7. \tBlue Flash also contends in its brief that the jurisdiction of the trial court has\r\nbeen invoked under section 42.01 of the Texas Property Tax Code, for which\r\nthere is not a deadline to seek appellate review. <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. §\r\n42.01 (Vernon 2001).  Section 42.01 applies to a taxpayer's right to appeal a\r\ndetermination of the appraisal review board.  <em>See id. </em> Blue Flash is not\r\nappealing any order or determination of the appraisal review board, but, rather,\r\nasserts that the appraisal roll is defective as an affirmative defense to the\r\nTaxing Entities' collection suit and as a declaratory judgment cause of action\r\nagainst the District and Board.  Although there is a determination on Blue\r\nFlash's account number 0950209 correction motion for the 2002 tax year based\r\non whether Blue Flash was entitled to an exemption, Blue Flash did not file a\r\nmotion to correct for the 2002 tax year based on whether account number\r\n0950209 was a duplicate account. </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, the Texas Property Tax Code has deadlines for appealing an order\r\nof the appraisal review board.  Section 42.06 provides that to exercise a right\r\nto appeal an order of an appraisal review board, a party must file written notice\r\nof appeal within 15 days after the date that the taxpayer received the notice.\r\n<em>See id</em>. § 42.06(a) (Vernon 2001).  Additionally, section 25.25 provides that\r\nwithin 45 days after receiving notice of the appraisal review board's\r\ndetermination the taxpayer may file suit to compel the board to order a change\r\nin the appraisal roll.  <em>See id</em>.</span><span></span><span> § 25.25(g) (Vernon Supp. 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\r\n<p>8. \tSection 41.41(a)(9) of the Texas Property Tax Code specifies that property\r\nowners are entitled to protest any action of the chief appraiser, appraisal\r\ndistrict, or appraisal review board that applies to and adversely affects the\r\nproperty owner.  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 41.41(a)(9) (Vernon 2001).   A\r\nprotest under section 41.41 must be filed no later than June 1 or the thirtieth\r\nday after the notice of appraised value is delivered to the property owner,\r\nwhichever is later.  <em>Id. </em>§ 41.44(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2006).\r\n</p><p>9. \tUnder section 25.25(c) of the Texas Property Tax Code, a property owner is\r\ngiven up to five years to request that the appraisal review board change the\r\nappraisal roll to correct (1) clerical errors, (2) multiple appraisals, or (3) the\r\ninclusion of property that does not exist in the form or at the location described\r\nin the appraisal roll.  Tex. Tax Code Ann.</p></span><span></span><span> § 25.25 (c).  The purpose of section\r\n25.25(c) is to allow late changes to otherwise finalized appraisal records only\r\nin situations in which \"the decision to make the change is based on an\r\nobjective, factual determination and the payment of taxes based on the\r\nuncorrected records would be fundamentally unfair.\"  <em>GE Capital Corp. v.\r\nDallas Cent.

App.--Dallas 1998,\r\nno pet.).</span><span>\t \t\r\n<p>10. \tSection 31.04(a-1) of the Texas Property Tax Code provides specific\r\nguidelines for when tax bills become delinquent if the bill includes property\r\nthat was erroneously omitted.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. </p></span><span></span><span>§ 31.04(a-1) (Vernon\r\nSupp. 2006).  If a tax bill is mailed and it includes taxes for one or more\r\npreceding tax years because the property was erroneously omitted from the tax\r\nroll in those tax years, the delinquency date that is provided by section 31.02\r\nis postponed to February 1 of the first year that will provide a period of at least\r\n180 days after the date that the tax bill is mailed in which to pay the taxes\r\nbefore they become delinquent.  <em>Id.</em></span><span>\t \r\n<p>11. \tThe Taxing Authorities are required to provide property owners notice in\r\nwriting.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 25.19(a), (b), (g), (h), (j) (Vernon Supp.\r\n2006).  The notice must cite appraised property value, segregate real and\r\npersonal property appraisals, and provide a detailed explanation of the time and\r\nprocedure for protesting the appraisal value.  <em>Id</em>. Supplemental appraisal\r\nrecords are the proper way to add omitted property to the appraisal roll, subject\r\nto review, protest, and appeal under chapters 41 and 42 of the Texas Property\r\nTax Code.  <em>Id.</em> § 25.23(a)(1), (d) (Vernon 2001).   \r\n</p><p>12. \tIn addition, the Texas Property Tax Code  expressly provides that a taxpayer's\r\nfailure to receive notice does not affect the validity of the appraisal or \"the\r\nimposition of any tax on the basis of the appraisal.\"  Tex. Tax Code Ann. §\r\n25.19(d); <em>Denton Cent. Appraisal Dist. v.

Tax Code Ann. § 25.25.  To the contrary, section 25.25(g) provides that\r\na property owner may file suit to compel the board to order a change to the\r\nappraisal roll within 45 days after receiving <em>notice</em> of the appraisal review\r\nboard's determination.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> § 25.25(g).\r\n</p><p>14. \tSection 25.25(d) of the Texas Property Tax Code provides, \"At any time prior\r\nto the date the taxes become delinquent, a property owner or the chief appraiser\r\nmay file a motion with the appraisal review board to change the appraisal roll\r\nto correct an error that resulted in an incorrect appraised value for the owner's\r\nproperty.  However, the error may not be corrected unless it resulted in an\r\nappraised value that exceeds by more than one-third the correct appraised\r\nvalue.\"  Tex.
