Kirk Burbage and the Burbage Funeral Home (collectively, \"Kirk\").  Kirk\r\nsued his brother Chad for defamation on the basis of statements Chad made on a website and in\r\nletters to third parties.  A jury awarded Kirk nearly $10,000,000 in compensatory and exemplary\r\ndamages, and the trial court permanently enjoined Chad from publishing statements like those\r\nat issue in the suit.  On appeal, Chad argues that we should reverse the judgment and remand for a\r\nnew trial because (1) Kirk's attorney made improper jury arguments that resulted in incurable harm\r\nand (2) the letters Chad sent to third parties were protected by the common-interest privilege.  Chad\r\nalso argues that we should reverse the damages awards because they are unsupported by the\r\nevidence, excessive under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\r\nand excessive under Texas statute.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. art. 41.008(b)\r\n(West Supp. 2010).  Finally, Chad argues that we should vacate the permanent injunction because\r\nit is an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm\r\nthe compensatory damages award, modify the exemplary damages award to comport with Texas's\r\nstatutory cap, and vacate the permanent injunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad and Kirk Burbage are brothers with a long history of conflict.  Their family has\r\nowned the Burbage Funeral Home, reportedly the oldest family-owned funeral home in the state of\r\nMaryland, for over two centuries.  Chad and Kirk Burbage's grandmother, Anna Burbage, ran the\r\nfuneral home for decades starting in the 1940s.  When Anna Burbage died in 1985, she willed the\r\nfuneral home to Kirk Burbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad came to believe that Kirk Burbage had secured this inheritance through\r\nuntoward means.  Chad also questioned his brother's acquisition of a quitclaim deed from their\r\nmother, Virginia Markham, for a half-interest in the family cemetery.  The siblings clashed over\r\nthese and many other matters.  Their conflict came to a head after Kirk Burbage sold mausoleums\r\nin the family cemetery to Shirley and Brice Phillips, who were not members of the Burbage family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn early 2008, Chad created a website, annaburbage.org, where he published many\r\nof his complaints about his brother's actions, including the following allegations:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\"Anna Burbage ('Miss Anna') was a victim of Elder Abuse.  The Abuser was\r\nher grandson, Kirk Burbage and others.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Virginia Burbage Markham was the principal of Stephen Decatur High\r\nSchool serving Northern Worcester County Maryland.  At the present time,\r\nshe is being abused by her son, Kirk Burbage, of the Burbage Funeral Home.\r\nShe is currently a victim of ELDER as well as FAMILY ABUSE.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"The methods [of abuse of Virginia Markham by Kirk Burbage] include: \r\nlies, trespassing, grand larceny, will tampering/undue influence, gifts with\r\nthe intent to control his mother, discrediting fellow siblings, deceptively\r\nmisrepresenting the contents of legal documents requiring the signature of the\r\nABUSED for personal gain and to cover up land fraud and involving the\r\nABUSED ELDER in Cemetery Land Fraud implicating several families\r\nincluding Shirley and Brice Phillips of the Phillips Crab House.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage has also been known to abuse the dead, specifically his cousin,\r\nAnne Prettyman Jones.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Chad's website was operative for approximately four months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAround the time that the website was operative, Chad wrote two letters to the\r\nPhillipses, the couple that had purchased mausoleums from his brother.  Chad's letters included the\r\nfollowing statements:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\"Kirk Burbage has committed numerous abuses to family members.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"We are the victims of the selfish, greedy and unlawful actions of\r\nKirk Burbage.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage of the Burbage Funeral Home with the assistance of his\r\nattorney Robert McIntosh [has] fraudulently misrepresented rights which\r\nKirk Burbage does not have.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage fraudulently obtained a Quit Claim [deed] from our mother by\r\nwhat is believed to be elder abuse.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage and the Burbage Funeral Home violated Maryland law by not\r\nhaving a license to operate a cemetery.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage did commit fraud.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn April 2008, Kirk filed suit against Chad in Bastrop County, Texas (where\r\nChad lived), alleging that the above statements from the website and the letters to the Phillipses\r\nwere defamatory.  The parties proceeded to trial, and the jury ultimately found in favor of Kirk on\r\nall issues.  The jury awarded Kirk $3,802,000 in non-economic, compensatory damages:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>$300,000 for \"Injury to reputation sustained in the past.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>$3,500,000 for \"Injury to reputation that, in reasonable probability,\" Kirk\r\n\"will sustain in the future.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>$1,000 for \"Mental anguish sustained in the past.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>$1,000 for \"Mental anguish that, in reasonable probability,\" Kirk \"will\r\nsustain in the future.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury also awarded Kirk $5,800,000 in exemplary damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court entered judgment on the jury's verdict.  The court also permanently\r\nenjoined Chad from \"publishing, disseminating or causing to be published or disseminated, whether\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to third-parties by any means, whether verbal or in writing, any statement or\r\nrepresentation that states, implies or suggests in whole or in part\" anything \"of the same or similar\r\nnature as [the representations] at issue in this lawsuit.\"  The permanent injunction includes a roughly\r\nfour-page list of prohibited subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad now appeals the judgment and the injunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad makes four arguments on appeal:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Kirk's attorney made improper, incurable jury arguments during trial that\r\nlikely resulted in the rendition of an improper judgment;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>Chad's letters to the Phillipses were not defamatory because they were\r\nprotected by the common-interest privilege, and Kirk failed to overcome the\r\nprivilege with a showing of actual malice;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the damages awards are unsupported by the evidence and excessive; and </li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the permanent injunction is an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>We will address these arguments in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>1.  Improper Jury Arguments</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his first point, Chad argues that Kirk's attorney made improper, incurable jury\r\narguments that likely influenced the jury to render judgment on an improper basis.  Chad seems to\r\nconcede that he did not preserve error with regard to Kirk's attorney's jury arguments.  <em>See Living\r\nCtrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Penalver</em>, 256 S.W.3d 678, 680 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam) (\"Error as to improper\r\njury argument must ordinarily be preserved by a timely objection which is overruled.\").  As such,\r\nhis appellate argument relies on the allegedly \"incurable\" nature of Kirk's attorney's arguments.  <em>See\r\nid</em>. (noting that in rare instances where probable harm from jury argument was such that it could not\r\nbe cured, appellant may complain about argument even if he did not object to it during trial). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\"To prevail on a claim that improper argument was incurable, the complaining party\r\ngenerally must show that the argument by its nature, degree, and extent constituted such error that\r\nan instruction from the court or retraction of the argument could not . . . eliminate the probability that\r\nit resulted in an improper verdict.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 680-81.  \"The party claiming incurable harm must persuade\r\nthe court that, based on the record as a whole, the offensive argument was so extreme that a juror of\r\nordinary intelligence could have been persuaded by that argument to agree to a verdict contrary\r\nto that to which he would have agreed but for such argument.\"  <em>Phillips v. Bramlett</em>, 288 S.W.3d 876,\r\n883 (Tex. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  On this record, we are not persuaded that the\r\narguments of which Chad complains rise to the level of creating reversible error. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad focuses on three jury arguments that he claims each represented incurable harm:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Kirk's attorney repeatedly said that Chad had accused Kirk of \"abusing\r\ncorpses.\"  Chad claims this to be a misrepresentation of what his website\r\nactually said, which was that Kirk had \"been known to abuse the dead,\r\nspecifically his cousin, Anne Prettyman Jones.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>Kirk's attorney exhorted the jury to \"kick\" Chad, taking the term \"kick\"\r\nfrom a videotaped deposition of Chad and Kirk's mother, Virginia Markham,\r\nthat was played for the jury.  In the deposition, Markham was asked what\r\nAnna Burbage would have thought of the statements on her grandson Chad's\r\nwebsite.  Markham responded, \"I think she could kick [Chad] down the steps\r\njust as fast as she could kick him.\"  In his closing argument, Kirk's attorney\r\nasked the jury to \"kick\" Chad the way Anna Burbage purportedly would\r\nhave, to \"leave a definable footprint\" because that was \"what Anna Burbage\r\nwould have done.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>Kirk's attorney stated during closing argument that \"Negotiating with\r\nChad Burbage is like negotiating with a terrorist aiming a gun at your loved\r\none.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also cites several \"epithets, personal attacks, and expressions of personal anger\r\nand animosity\" that Kirk's attorney used.  Kirk's attorney:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>twice accused Chad of lying while cross-examining him;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>called Chad a \"bully,\" \"sinister,\" and \"cowardly,\" and accused him of\r\nextorting his family;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>likened Chad to a \"vicious pit bull\" who \"latches on to your throat and rips\r\nout your jugular vein and leaves you for dead\"; and</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>stated that he was personally angry at Chad.</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Chad contends that these statements collectively caused incurable harm.  <em>See Standard Fire Ins. Co.\r\nv. Reese</em>, 584 S.W.2d 835, 839-40 (Tex. 1979) (noting that when determining whether improper\r\narguments were incurable, we consider not only \"nature, degree and extent of error,\" but also\r\n\"whether there was cumulative error\").  We will address Chad's complaints in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad's initial complaint is that Kirk's attorney, during his opening statement, told\r\nthe jury:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>[Chad] accused Kirk Burbage of abusing the dead.  Those words were chosen\r\nvery carefully by the way.  Those words were chosen so that people who read it [sic]\r\nwould assume that Kirk Burbage was doing something to the physical corpses of the\r\nloved ones who were entrusted to him.  That's the death blow to a funeral home.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Kirk's attorney returned to this theme repeatedly throughout the trial.  During closing argument,\r\nKirk's attorney said:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>And most heinous of all, Chad Burbage has accused Kirk Burbage of abusing\r\ncorpses.  Make no mistake about that.  Chad Burbage may have said in his website\r\n. . . that Kirk Burbage abuses the dead, but what he is accusing him of is abusing the\r\ndeceased or the bodies of the deceased who were entrusted to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Kirk's attorney also said that (1) \"Chad Burbage . . . created the annaburbage.org Web site in\r\nwhich he publicly accused Kirk Burbage of committing . . . abuse of corpses\"; (2) \"Chad Burbage\r\nhas no personal knowledge and witnessed none of the incidents which he claims constitute . . .\r\nabuse of corpses\"; and (3) the \"false accusations of . . . abuse of corpses have spread throughout\r\nthe community.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad's argument relies on the distinction between what Chad said, i.e., that Kirk\r\n\"has been known to abuse the dead,\" and Kirk's lawyer's characterization of the allegations as\r\n\"abuse of corpses.\"  Chad argues that the former has less sinister implications and that he accused\r\nKirk of abusing only one dead person (his cousin, Anne Prettyman Jones), not \"corps<em>es</em>\" plural.\r\nDuring trial, Chad claimed that his statement that Kirk had been known to \"abuse the dead\" referred\r\nto an occasion when Kirk complained about his deceased cousin owing him money.  Chad also\r\nargued during closing that \"abuse of the dead\" could refer to his and Kirk's dispute over the family\r\ncemetery or to \"[b]urying people on land that is contested.\"  On appeal, Chad argues that Kirk's\r\nclaim that Chad accused him of \"abuse of corpses\" was both highly inflammatory and unsupported\r\nby the evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter reviewing the entire record, we do not believe that Kirk's characterization\r\nof Chad's accusation as \"abuse of corpses\" rises to the level of an incurable jury argument.  At the\r\noutset, we are not persuaded by Chad's argument accusing Kirk, a funeral director, of having\r\n\"been known to abuse the dead,\" is more benign than or insufficient to support an inference\r\nthat Chad was accusing Kirk of \"abusing corpses.\"  Even if we assume that the phrase \"abuse of\r\ncorpses\" is somehow more inflammatory than alleging that a funeral director \"abuse[d] the dead,\"\r\nKirk's attorney clarified several times that he was not attributing the phrase \"abuse of corpses\"\r\ndirectly to Chad but rather was saying that the phrase was implied by Chad's words.  The jury saw\r\nChad's exact words and heard Chad's explanation of what he meant by \"abuse the dead.\"  The jury\r\nwas free to draw its own conclusions about what Chad's words meant or implied.  Furthermore,\r\nthe reasonableness of this interpretation of Chad's words was supported by testimony, as Kirk called\r\na witness who had seen Chad's website while it was operative, and the witness testified that\r\nhe interpreted the phrase \"abuse the dead\" to mean \"abuse of corpses.\"  On these facts, we cannot\r\nconclude that, \"based on the record as a whole,\" Kirk's \"abuse of corpses\" references were\r\n\"so extreme that a juror of ordinary intelligence could have been persuaded by that argument to\r\nagree to a verdict contrary to that to which he would have agreed but for such argument.\"  <em>Bramlett</em>,\r\n288 S.W.3d at 883.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that Kirk's attorney improperly exhorted the jury to \"kick\" Chad\r\nthe way Anna Burbage purportedly would have, trying to \"induce the jury to abandon their position\r\nas fair and impartial jurors and to assume the position of a partisan or claimant in the case.\"  <em>World\r\nWide Tire Co. v. Brown</em>, 644 S.W.2d 144, 146 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.) (citation omitted).  Even if this were true, however, the harm caused by Kirk's attorney's\r\nexhortation would not have been incurable.  <em>See id</em>. (holding that when plaintiff told jurors they\r\nshould award him what they would want in his position, error \"was not of such a nature that its\r\nharmful effect could not have been removed\" by objection and instruction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that \"in today's post-9/11 political climate,\" Kirk's attorney caused\r\nincurable harm when he stated during closing argument that \"[n]egotiating with Chad Burbage is\r\nlike negotiating with a terrorist aiming a gun at your loved one.\"  Chad fails to mention that this\r\nargument was followed with the statement \"[negotiating with Chad] is a demand accompanied by\r\na threat.\"  The jury saw emails in which Chad threatened to publicize his accusations of abuse unless\r\nKirk agreed to renegotiate family-property disputes.  Kirk's attorney did not say Chad <em>was</em> a terrorist,\r\nor even that Chad behaved generally like a terrorist; he said only that negotiating with Chad\r\nwas \"like\" negotiating with a terrorist.  In context, the \"terrorist\" comparison does not strike us as\r\nfundamentally compromising Chad's ability to get a fair trial.  <em>See Penalver</em>, 256 S.W.3d at 680-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues, on the other hand, that \"terrorist\" comparisons necessarily result\r\nin incurable harm.  In support of this position he cites <em>Showbiz Multimedia LLC v. Mountain State\r\nMortg. Ctrs., Inc.</em>, 303 S.W.3d 769, 770 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.).  The\r\n<em>Showbiz Multimedia</em> court did indeed find incurable harm in defense counsel's statement that the\r\nplaintiff's lawsuit represented \"judicial terrorism,\" <em>id</em>., but it did so against a very different factual\r\nbackdrop.  The plaintiff in that case was a \"South Asian-American,\" <em>id</em>., and defense counsel coupled\r\nhis statement about judicial terrorism with a statement, \"wholly unsupported by the record, that\r\na business associate of [the plaintiff's] felt 'scared to death of this man' due to 'cultural issues.'\" \r\n<em>Id</em>. at 772.  The appellate court thus characterized defense counsel's argument as making \"improper\r\nappeals to race [and] nationalism,\" which the supreme court has specifically cited as forms of\r\nincurable argument.  <em>See id</em>.  Here, in contrast, the \"terrorism\" comment did not involve an appeal\r\nto race or nationalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also cites <em>Mills v. State</em>, No. 07-08-00348-CR, 2009 WL 3320249, at *3\r\n(Tex. App.--Amarillo Oct. 14, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication),\r\nin support of the argument that \"terrorist\" comparisons necessarily cause incurable harm.  <em>Mills</em>\r\nis distinguishable because it involved a prosecutor directly comparing a criminal defendant to\r\n9/11 hijacker Muhammed Atta.  <em>See id</em>. at *1.  In the same breath, the prosecutor also compared\r\nthe defendant to serial killers John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer.  <em>Id</em>.  We think it obvious that,\r\nespecially in the criminal context, such comparisons are far more egregious than a comment during a\r\ncivil trial that negotiating with an opponent is \"like\" negotiating with a terrorist.  In sum, we are not\r\npersuaded that the \"terrorist\" comment represented incurable harm.  The comment was analogical,\r\noccurred only once, and was quickly clarified with an explanation that was arguably supported by\r\nthe evidence.  <em>Cf</em>. <em>Reese</em>, 584 S.W.2d at 839-40 (noting whether improper argument caused incurable\r\nharm depends on nature, degree and extent of error).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFinally, Chad complains about the personal epithets Kirk's attorney directed at him.\r\nHe argues that these epithets collectively caused incurable harm, especially when coupled\r\nwith the statements described above.  Having reviewed the entirety of the record, we find that the\r\ncomplained-of epithets, while arguably inappropriate, do not rise to the level of creating incurable\r\nharm in light of the facts of this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn sum, we do not agree that Kirk's attorney's jury arguments were so extreme and\r\nunsupported as to represent incurable error.  We overrule Chad's first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>2.  Whether Chad's Letters to the Phillipses Were Protected by the Common-Interest Privilege</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad's second point on appeal asserts that the trial court erred by allowing Kirk to\r\nrecover damages for the statements Chad made in his letters to the Phillipses, who purchased a\r\nmausoleum site from Kirk.  Chad argues that the statements cannot be defamatory because he had\r\na \"common interest\" with the Phillipses, making his statements privileged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tA \"common-interest\" privilege is \"granted to statements that occur under\r\ncircumstances wherein any one of several persons having a common interest in a particular\r\nsubject matter may reasonably believe that facts exist that another, sharing that common\r\ninterest, is entitled to know.\"  <em>Hanssen v. Our Redeemer Lutheran Church</em>, 938 S.W.2d 85, 92\r\n(Tex. App.--Dallas 1996, writ denied).  A statement qualifies for the common-interest privilege only\r\nif it is made \"for the purpose of protecting the common interest.\"  <em>Grant v. Stop-N-Go Mkt. of Tex.,\r\nInc.</em>, 994 S.W.2d 867, 874 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.).  A statement that meets\r\nthese criteria is presumed to have been made in good faith and without malice, meaning that\r\nit cannot support recovery in defamation unless the presumption of good faith is overcome.  <em>See\r\nMarathon Oil Co. v. Salazar</em>, 682 S.W.2d 624, 630 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.).  A plaintiff may overcome the common-interest presumption of good faith with a showing\r\nof \"actual malice,\" i.e., a showing that the statement was published \"with knowledge of its falsity\r\nor with reckless disregard as to its truth.\"  <em>Grant</em>, 994 S.W.2d at 874.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that he shared a common interest with the Phillipses because Kirk\r\nhad sold the Phillipses mausoleums in the Burbage family cemetery.  Thus, argues Chad, he and the\r\nPhillipses shared an interest in ensuring that Kirk had not been selling rights to the family's cemetery\r\nland without legal authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAt the outset of a common-interest analysis, we note that Chad's interest in\r\nkeeping the Phillipses out of the family cemetery was antithetical to the Phillipses' interest in owning\r\ntheir cemetery spaces.  But even if we assume that Chad is right about having a common interest\r\nwith the Phillipses, at least some of his allegedly defamatory statements to the Phillipses were\r\nclearly not made \"for the purpose of protecting the common interest.\"  <em>See Grant</em>, 994 S.W.2d\r\nat 874.  Specifically, the following statements in Chad's letters have no arguable relation to Kirk's\r\nsale of mausoleums to the Phillipses:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\"Kirk Burbage has committed numerous abuses to family members.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage fraudulently obtained a Quit Claim [deed] from our mother<em> by\r\nwhat is believed to be elder abuse</em>.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Clearly, these statements (at a minimum) were not subject to the common-interest privilege.  <em>See id</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that if even <em>some</em> of his statements to the Phillipses were protected by the\r\ncommon-interest privilege then we must reverse the judgment.  He bases this argument on the fact\r\nthat the trial court submitted broad-form damages questions to the jury rather than segregating the\r\ndamages by statement.  However, Chad did not object in the trial court to the submission of broad-form damages questions, so we cannot reverse on the basis that the broad-form damages questions\r\nmay have included both valid and invalid grounds for recovery.  <em>See In re B.L.D.</em>, 113 S.W.3d 340,\r\n349 (Tex. 2003) (holding that complaints of error in broad-form submission must be preserved\r\nby objection at trial).  Thus, even if we were inclined to find that some of Chad's statements were\r\nprotected by the common-interest privilege, which we are not, the jury's broad-form findings would\r\nbe well supported by other statements.  We therefore overrule Chad's second appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>3.  Whether the Damages Awards are Unsupported by the Evidence and Excessive</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his third issue, Chad argues that Kirk's non-economic, compensatory\r\ndamages award was unsupported by the evidence and excessive under the First Amendment.  He\r\nalso argues that Kirk's exemplary damages award was excessive under Texas statute and\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  We will address the compensatory and exemplary damages awards\r\nseparately.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<strong><em>Compensatory Damages</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that the jury's award of roughly $3,800,000 in compensatory damages\r\nto Kirk was excessive and unreasonable because there was little evidence that Kirk's reputation was\r\nactually harmed or would continue to be harmed in the future.  Specifically, Chad argues that there\r\nwas no evidence as to how many people had viewed his website while it was operative, and the fact\r\nthat the website was taken down long before trial meant that future reputational harm was especially\r\nunlikely.  Chad argues that Kirk produced no evidence to substantiate that his reputation or business\r\nhad actually been harmed by Chad's statements.  While Kirk testified that a few customers canceled\r\ntheir prepaid funeral arrangements after Chad published his statements, Chad argues that Kirk\r\nproduced no evidence to substantiate these cancellations or tie them directly to Chad's statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad contrasts the damages awarded to Kirk with those awarded to the plaintiff in\r\n<em>Bentley v. Bunton</em>, 94 S.W.3d 561 (Tex. 2002).  In <em>Bentley</em>, a judge sued a television personality who\r\nhad broadcast several defamatory statements about the judge over a long period of time.  <em>Id</em>. at 567-74.  The judge presented significant evidence that the statements had been widely heard and had\r\nactually harmed his reputation.  <em>Id</em>. at 570-73.  A jury awarded him $175,000 in damages based on\r\npast and future reputational harm.  <em>Id</em>. at 576.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that in <em>Bentley</em> the harm was much better established than the harm\r\nhere, yet the damages award was much smaller, suggesting that Kirk's compensatory damages award\r\nwas excessive.  At issue in <em>Bentley</em>, though, was one public servant's reputation.  Here, in contrast,\r\nthe jury was presented with evidence that Chad's statements harmed the reputation not only of a\r\nprivate individual, but also of a well-established, long-running business with considerable goodwill\r\nbuilt up in its community.  As such, the damages awarded in <em>Bentley</em> do not necessarily guide the\r\nappropriate damages here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tRather, in reviewing Kirk's compensatory damages award, we follow the general\r\nrule that the jury is afforded significant latitude in determining the proper measure of damages.  <em>Id</em>.\r\nat 605.  We review a damages award for whether it is excessive, unsupported by the evidence,\r\nor unreasonable.  <em>Id</em>. at 605-06.  There must be some evidence to justify the amount awarded, and\r\nthat amount must \"fairly and reasonably\" compensate for the loss incurred.  <em>Id</em>. at 606.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHaving reviewed the entire record, we cannot say that Kirk's compensatory damages\r\naward is excessive or unreasonable.  First, Kirk testified that Chad's defamatory accusations were\r\n\"all over town.\"  Second, Chad conceded that his accusations would \"have significant repercussions\r\non Kirk's business.\"  Third, Kirk testified that the Burbage Funeral Home had a market value of\r\nat least $3 million and that this value would likely be lost because of Chad's statements.  Chad\r\ncomplains that this testimony was not substantiated with documentary evidence, but no such\r\nrequirement exists.  Rather, the jury had latitude to use Kirk's testimony as a basis for calculating\r\ncompensatory damages.  We therefore hold that the jury's compensatory damages award to Kirk did\r\nnot lack evidentiary support.  <em>See id</em>.  Chad also argues that the First Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution prohibits \"excessive noneconomic damages awards in defamation cases because they\r\nthreaten to inhibit constitutionally protected speech.\"  Having just determined that the compensatory\r\ndamages awarded here were not excessive, we find Chad's First Amendment argument unpersuasive.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<strong><em>Exemplary Damages</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t<strong><em>Texas Statute</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that the jury's nearly $6 million exemplary damages award to Kirk is\r\nexcessive under Texas law.  We agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code article 41.008(b) provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Exemplary damages awarded against a defendant may not exceed an amount equal\r\nto the greater of:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>(1) \t(A) two times the amount of economic damages; plus </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t(B) an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\r\nexceed $750,000; or </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>(2) \t$200,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. art. 41.008(b).  Bearing in mind that no economic damages were\r\nawarded here, this statute plainly limits Kirk to $750,000 in exemplary damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tKirk argues that article 41.008(b) does not apply here because Chad did not invoke\r\nit in the trial court.  But Chad's amended answer explicitly stated that \"[i]f the Defendant is found\r\nliable for exemplary damages, those damages must be capped under the Texas Damages Act.\"  We\r\ntherefore modify the exemplary damages award to $750,000 to accord with Texas's statutory\r\nexemplary-damage cap. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t<strong><em>The Fourteenth Amendment</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that the exemplary damages award violates the Due Process\r\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment by its sheer size.  It is true that an excessive exemplary\r\ndamages award may deprive a litigant of due process.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>,\r\n212 S.W.3d 299, 307-08 (Tex. 2006).  \"In reviewing the amount of an exemplary damage award\r\nfor constitutionality, we have been directed to consider three 'guideposts':  (1) the nature of the\r\ndefendant's conduct, (2) the ratio between exemplary and compensatory damages, and (3) the size\r\nof civil penalties in comparable cases.\"  <em>Id</em>. at 308.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThese guideposts do not suggest that an exemplary damages award modified\r\nto $750,000 is unconstitutional.  <em>Cf. id</em>.  Regarding the first guidepost, the jury found that Chad\r\nmaliciously and repeatedly published statements accusing his brother of heinous crimes knowing\r\nthat his brother worked in an industry where reputation is paramount.  <em>Cf. id</em>. (concluding that\r\nreprehensibility of defendant's conduct depends in part on whether defendant's conduct involved\r\nrepeated acts, threatened financial ruin, and resulted from malice).  Regarding the second guidepost,\r\na $750,000 exemplary damages award is far less than the roughly $3,800,000 compensatory damages\r\naward that we have already determined not to be excessive.  <em>Cf. id</em>. (suggesting that exemplary-to-compensatory-damages ratio of more than four to one probably unconstitutional).  Regarding the\r\nthird guidepost, Chad has not pointed us to a single case where, as here, defamatory statements\r\nthreatened to harm a multi-million-dollar business.  Thus, he has provided us no basis for concluding\r\nthat a $750,000 exemplary damages award is incommensurate with the damages awards in\r\n\"comparable\" cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that Kirk's exemplary damages award violates the\r\nFourteenth Amendment because it was based \"in part upon [the jury's] desire to punish the defendant\r\nfor harming persons who are not before the court.\"  <em>Philip Morris USA v. Williams</em>, 549 U.S. 346,\r\n349 (2007) (emphasis deleted).  Specifically, Chad argues that the exemplary damages award was\r\npartially based on the jury's desire to punish Chad for harming his grandmother, Anna Burbage, who\r\nwas not a party to the lawsuit.  Chad notes that Kirk emphasized Anna Burbage's status, legacy, and\r\nreputation throughout the trial.  This emphasis, however, also spoke directly to the harm done to the\r\nBurbage Funeral Home (which <em>was</em> a party to the lawsuit) because its community standing derived\r\nlargely from its connection with Anna Burbage.  We therefore see no basis for concluding that the\r\nemphasis on Anna Burbage's status, legacy, and reputation persuaded the jury to consider anything\r\nother than the harm to Kirk and the Burbage Funeral Home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn sum, we agree with Chad that Kirk's exemplary damages award must be reduced\r\nto $750,000 to accord with Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code article 41.008(b).  Beyond that,\r\nwe reject Chad's arguments that the jury's exemplary damages award was improper.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Whether the Permanent Injunction is Unconstitutional</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFinally, Chad argues that the permanent injunction imposed by the trial court\r\nrepresents an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.  The court simply signed without altering\r\na proposed injunction that Kirk submitted.  That injunction permanently enjoined Chad from\r\n\"publishing, disseminating or causing to be published or disseminated, whether directly or indirectly,\r\nto third-parties by any means, whether verbal or in writing, any statement or representation that\r\nstates, implies or suggests in whole or in part\" anything \"of the same or similar nature as [the\r\nrepresentations] at issue in this lawsuit.\"  The permanent injunction includes a roughly four-page list\r\nof prohibited subjects.  We agree with Chad that the injunction is unconstitutional. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tA prior restraint is a \"judicial order[] forbidding certain communications when\r\nissued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\"  <em>Alexander v. United States</em>,\r\n509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (emphasis deleted).  Such orders are highly disfavored under federal law\r\nand even more highly disfavored under Texas law.  <em>See Davenport v. Garcia</em>, 834 S.W.2d 4, 10\r\n(Tex. 1992).  Thus, defamatory speech is not sufficiently injurious to warrant prior restraint.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>,<em> Hajek v. Bill Mowbray Motors, Inc.</em>, 647 S.W.2d 253, 255 (Tex. 1983) (per curiam)\r\n(\"Defamation alone is not a sufficient justification for restraining an individual's right to speak\r\nfreely.\");<em> Brammer v. KB Home Lone Star, L.P.</em>, 114 S.W.3d 101, 107 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003,\r\nno pet.) (concluding that harm resulting from defamation does not rise to level necessary to\r\nmake prior restraint constitutional).  We therefore vacate the permanent injunction entered by the\r\ntrial court.<strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\tFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the compensatory damages award, modify\r\nthe exemplary damages award to $750,000, and vacate the permanent injunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Rose, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Justices Puryear, Pemberton and Rose</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affirmed in part; Modified and, as Modified, Affirmed in part; Vacated in part</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filed:   December 21, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Kirk Burbage and the Burbage Funeral Home (collectively, \"Kirk\").  Kirk\r\nsued his brother Chad for defamation on the basis of statements Chad made on a website and in\r\nletters to third parties.  A jury awarded Kirk nearly $10,000,000 in compensatory and exemplary\r\ndamages, and the trial court permanently enjoined Chad from publishing statements like those\r\nat issue in the suit.  On appeal, Chad argues that we should reverse the judgment and remand for a\r\nnew trial because (1) Kirk's attorney made improper jury arguments that resulted in incurable harm\r\nand (2) the letters Chad sent to third parties were protected by the common-interest privilege.  Chad\r\nalso argues that we should reverse the damages awards because they are unsupported by the\r\nevidence, excessive under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\r\nand excessive under Texas statute.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. art. 41.008(b)\r\n(West Supp. 2010).  Finally, Chad argues that we should vacate the permanent injunction because\r\nit is an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm\r\nthe compensatory damages award, modify the exemplary damages award to comport with Texas's\r\nstatutory cap, and vacate the permanent injunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad and Kirk Burbage are brothers with a long history of conflict.  Their family has\r\nowned the Burbage Funeral Home, reportedly the oldest family-owned funeral home in the state of\r\nMaryland, for over two centuries.  Chad and Kirk Burbage's grandmother, Anna Burbage, ran the\r\nfuneral home for decades starting in the 1940s.  When Anna Burbage died in 1985, she willed the\r\nfuneral home to Kirk Burbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad came to believe that Kirk Burbage had secured this inheritance through\r\nuntoward means.  Chad also questioned his brother's acquisition of a quitclaim deed from their\r\nmother, Virginia Markham, for a half-interest in the family cemetery.  The siblings clashed over\r\nthese and many other matters.  Their conflict came to a head after Kirk Burbage sold mausoleums\r\nin the family cemetery to Shirley and Brice Phillips, who were not members of the Burbage family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn early 2008, Chad created a website, annaburbage.org, where he published many\r\nof his complaints about his brother's actions, including the following allegations:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\"Anna Burbage ('Miss Anna') was a victim of Elder Abuse.  The Abuser was\r\nher grandson, Kirk Burbage and others.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Virginia Burbage Markham was the principal of Stephen Decatur High\r\nSchool serving Northern Worcester County Maryland.  At the present time,\r\nshe is being abused by her son, Kirk Burbage, of the Burbage Funeral Home.\r\nShe is currently a victim of ELDER as well as FAMILY ABUSE.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"The methods [of abuse of Virginia Markham by Kirk Burbage] include: \r\nlies, trespassing, grand larceny, will tampering/undue influence, gifts with\r\nthe intent to control his mother, discrediting fellow siblings, deceptively\r\nmisrepresenting the contents of legal documents requiring the signature of the\r\nABUSED for personal gain and to cover up land fraud and involving the\r\nABUSED ELDER in Cemetery Land Fraud implicating several families\r\nincluding Shirley and Brice Phillips of the Phillips Crab House.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage has also been known to abuse the dead, specifically his cousin,\r\nAnne Prettyman Jones.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Chad's website was operative for approximately four months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAround the time that the website was operative, Chad wrote two letters to the\r\nPhillipses, the couple that had purchased mausoleums from his brother.  Chad's letters included the\r\nfollowing statements:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\"Kirk Burbage has committed numerous abuses to family members.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"We are the victims of the selfish, greedy and unlawful actions of\r\nKirk Burbage.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage of the Burbage Funeral Home with the assistance of his\r\nattorney Robert McIntosh [has] fraudulently misrepresented rights which\r\nKirk Burbage does not have.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage fraudulently obtained a Quit Claim [deed] from our mother by\r\nwhat is believed to be elder abuse.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage and the Burbage Funeral Home violated Maryland law by not\r\nhaving a license to operate a cemetery.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage did commit fraud.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn April 2008, Kirk filed suit against Chad in Bastrop County, Texas (where\r\nChad lived), alleging that the above statements from the website and the letters to the Phillipses\r\nwere defamatory.  The parties proceeded to trial, and the jury ultimately found in favor of Kirk on\r\nall issues.  The jury awarded Kirk $3,802,000 in non-economic, compensatory damages:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>$300,000 for \"Injury to reputation sustained in the past.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>$3,500,000 for \"Injury to reputation that, in reasonable probability,\" Kirk\r\n\"will sustain in the future.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>$1,000 for \"Mental anguish sustained in the past.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>$1,000 for \"Mental anguish that, in reasonable probability,\" Kirk \"will\r\nsustain in the future.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury also awarded Kirk $5,800,000 in exemplary damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court entered judgment on the jury's verdict.  The court also permanently\r\nenjoined Chad from \"publishing, disseminating or causing to be published or disseminated, whether\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to third-parties by any means, whether verbal or in writing, any statement or\r\nrepresentation that states, implies or suggests in whole or in part\" anything \"of the same or similar\r\nnature as [the representations] at issue in this lawsuit.\"  The permanent injunction includes a roughly\r\nfour-page list of prohibited subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad now appeals the judgment and the injunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad makes four arguments on appeal:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Kirk's attorney made improper, incurable jury arguments during trial that\r\nlikely resulted in the rendition of an improper judgment;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>Chad's letters to the Phillipses were not defamatory because they were\r\nprotected by the common-interest privilege, and Kirk failed to overcome the\r\nprivilege with a showing of actual malice;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the damages awards are unsupported by the evidence and excessive; and </li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the permanent injunction is an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>We will address these arguments in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>1.  Improper Jury Arguments</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his first point, Chad argues that Kirk's attorney made improper, incurable jury\r\narguments that likely influenced the jury to render judgment on an improper basis.  Chad seems to\r\nconcede that he did not preserve error with regard to Kirk's attorney's jury arguments.  <em>See Living\r\nCtrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Penalver</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894942\"><a href=\"/opinion/894942/living-centers-of-texas-inc-v-penalver/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 680 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam) (\"Error as to improper\r\njury argument must ordinarily be preserved by a timely objection which is overruled.\").  As such,\r\nhis appellate argument relies on the allegedly \"incurable\" nature of Kirk's attorney's arguments.  <em>See\r\nid</em>. (noting that in rare instances where probable harm from jury argument was such that it could not\r\nbe cured, appellant may complain about argument even if he did not object to it during trial). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\"To prevail on a claim that improper argument was incurable, the complaining party\r\ngenerally must show that the argument by its nature, degree, and extent constituted such error that\r\nan instruction from the court or retraction of the argument could not . . . eliminate the probability that\r\nit resulted in an improper verdict.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 680-81.  \"The party claiming incurable harm must persuade\r\nthe court that, based on the record as a whole, the offensive argument was so extreme that a juror of\r\nordinary intelligence could have been persuaded by that argument to agree to a verdict contrary\r\nto that to which he would have agreed but for such argument.\"  <em>Phillips v. Bramlett</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895094\"><a href=\"/opinion/895094/phillips-v-bramlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>,\r\n883 (Tex. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  On this record, we are not persuaded that the\r\narguments of which Chad complains rise to the level of creating reversible error. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad focuses on three jury arguments that he claims each represented incurable harm:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Kirk's attorney repeatedly said that Chad had accused Kirk of \"abusing\r\ncorpses.\"  Chad claims this to be a misrepresentation of what his website\r\nactually said, which was that Kirk had \"been known to abuse the dead,\r\nspecifically his cousin, Anne Prettyman Jones.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>Kirk's attorney exhorted the jury to \"kick\" Chad, taking the term \"kick\"\r\nfrom a videotaped deposition of Chad and Kirk's mother, Virginia Markham,\r\nthat was played for the jury.  In the deposition, Markham was asked what\r\nAnna Burbage would have thought of the statements on her grandson Chad's\r\nwebsite.  Markham responded, \"I think she could kick [Chad] down the steps\r\njust as fast as she could kick him.\"  In his closing argument, Kirk's attorney\r\nasked the jury to \"kick\" Chad the way Anna Burbage purportedly would\r\nhave, to \"leave a definable footprint\" because that was \"what Anna Burbage\r\nwould have done.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>Kirk's attorney stated during closing argument that \"Negotiating with\r\nChad Burbage is like negotiating with a terrorist aiming a gun at your loved\r\none.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also cites several \"epithets, personal attacks, and expressions of personal anger\r\nand animosity\" that Kirk's attorney used.  Kirk's attorney:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>twice accused Chad of lying while cross-examining him;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>called Chad a \"bully,\" \"sinister,\" and \"cowardly,\" and accused him of\r\nextorting his family;</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>likened Chad to a \"vicious pit bull\" who \"latches on to your throat and rips\r\nout your jugular vein and leaves you for dead\"; and</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>stated that he was personally angry at Chad.</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Chad contends that these statements collectively caused incurable harm.  <em>See Standard Fire Ins.

We will address Chad's complaints in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad's initial complaint is that Kirk's attorney, during his opening statement, told\r\nthe jury:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>[Chad] accused Kirk Burbage of abusing the dead.  Those words were chosen\r\nvery carefully by the way.  Those words were chosen so that people who read it [sic]\r\nwould assume that Kirk Burbage was doing something to the physical corpses of the\r\nloved ones who were entrusted to him.  That's the death blow to a funeral home.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Kirk's attorney returned to this theme repeatedly throughout the trial.  During closing argument,\r\nKirk's attorney said:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>And most heinous of all, Chad Burbage has accused Kirk Burbage of abusing\r\ncorpses.  Make no mistake about that.  Chad Burbage may have said in his website\r\n. . . that Kirk Burbage abuses the dead, but what he is accusing him of is abusing the\r\ndeceased or the bodies of the deceased who were entrusted to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Kirk's attorney also said that (1) \"Chad Burbage . . . created the annaburbage.org Web site in\r\nwhich he publicly accused Kirk Burbage of committing . . . abuse of corpses\"; (2) \"Chad Burbage\r\nhas no personal knowledge and witnessed none of the incidents which he claims constitute . . .\r\nabuse of corpses\"; and (3) the \"false accusations of . . . abuse of corpses have spread throughout\r\nthe community.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad's argument relies on the distinction between what Chad said, i.e., that Kirk\r\n\"has been known to abuse the dead,\" and Kirk's lawyer's characterization of the allegations as\r\n\"abuse of corpses.\"  Chad argues that the former has less sinister implications and that he accused\r\nKirk of abusing only one dead person (his cousin, Anne Prettyman Jones), not \"corps<em>es</em>\" plural.\r\nDuring trial, Chad claimed that his statement that Kirk had been known to \"abuse the dead\" referred\r\nto an occasion when Kirk complained about his deceased cousin owing him money.  Chad also\r\nargued during closing that \"abuse of the dead\" could refer to his and Kirk's dispute over the family\r\ncemetery or to \"[b]urying people on land that is contested.\"  On appeal, Chad argues that Kirk's\r\nclaim that Chad accused him of \"abuse of corpses\" was both highly inflammatory and unsupported\r\nby the evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter reviewing the entire record, we do not believe that Kirk's characterization\r\nof Chad's accusation as \"abuse of corpses\" rises to the level of an incurable jury argument.  At the\r\noutset, we are not persuaded by Chad's argument accusing Kirk, a funeral director, of having\r\n\"been known to abuse the dead,\" is more benign than or insufficient to support an inference\r\nthat Chad was accusing Kirk of \"abusing corpses.\"  Even if we assume that the phrase \"abuse of\r\ncorpses\" is somehow more inflammatory than alleging that a funeral director \"abuse[d] the dead,\"\r\nKirk's attorney clarified several times that he was not attributing the phrase \"abuse of corpses\"\r\ndirectly to Chad but rather was saying that the phrase was implied by Chad's words.  The jury saw\r\nChad's exact words and heard Chad's explanation of what he meant by \"abuse the dead.\"  The jury\r\nwas free to draw its own conclusions about what Chad's words meant or implied.  Furthermore,\r\nthe reasonableness of this interpretation of Chad's words was supported by testimony, as Kirk called\r\na witness who had seen Chad's website while it was operative, and the witness testified that\r\nhe interpreted the phrase \"abuse the dead\" to mean \"abuse of corpses.\"  On these facts, we cannot\r\nconclude that, \"based on the record as a whole,\" Kirk's \"abuse of corpses\" references were\r\n\"so extreme that a juror of ordinary intelligence could have been persuaded by that argument to\r\nagree to a verdict contrary to that to which he would have agreed but for such argument.\"  <em>Bramlett</em>,\r\n288 S.W.3d at 883.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that Kirk's attorney improperly exhorted the jury to \"kick\" Chad\r\nthe way Anna Burbage purportedly would have, trying to \"induce the jury to abandon their position\r\nas fair and impartial jurors and to assume the position of a partisan or claimant in the case.\"  <em>World\r\nWide Tire Co. v.

App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.) (citation omitted).  Even if this were true, however, the harm caused by Kirk's attorney's\r\nexhortation would not have been incurable.  <em>See id</em>. (holding that when plaintiff told jurors they\r\nshould award him what they would want in his position, error \"was not of such a nature that its\r\nharmful effect could not have been removed\" by objection and instruction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that \"in today's post-9/11 political climate,\" Kirk's attorney caused\r\nincurable harm when he stated during closing argument that \"[n]egotiating with Chad Burbage is\r\nlike negotiating with a terrorist aiming a gun at your loved one.\"  Chad fails to mention that this\r\nargument was followed with the statement \"[negotiating with Chad] is a demand accompanied by\r\na threat.\"  The jury saw emails in which Chad threatened to publicize his accusations of abuse unless\r\nKirk agreed to renegotiate family-property disputes.  Kirk's attorney did not say Chad <em>was</em> a terrorist,\r\nor even that Chad behaved generally like a terrorist; he said only that negotiating with Chad\r\nwas \"like\" negotiating with a terrorist.  In context, the \"terrorist\" comparison does not strike us as\r\nfundamentally compromising Chad's ability to get a fair trial.  <em>See Penalver</em>, 256 S.W.3d at 680-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues, on the other hand, that \"terrorist\" comparisons necessarily result\r\nin incurable harm.  In support of this position he cites <em>Showbiz Multimedia LLC v. Mountain State\r\nMortg. Ctrs., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618779\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618779/showbiz-multimedia-v-mountain-states-mtge/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></a></span>, 770 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.).  The\r\n<em>Showbiz Multimedia</em> court did indeed find incurable harm in defense counsel's statement that the\r\nplaintiff's lawsuit represented \"judicial terrorism,\" <em>id</em>., but it did so against a very different factual\r\nbackdrop.  The plaintiff in that case was a \"South Asian-American,\" <em>id</em>., and defense counsel coupled\r\nhis statement about judicial terrorism with a statement, \"wholly unsupported by the record, that\r\na business associate of [the plaintiff's] felt 'scared to death of this man' due to 'cultural issues.'\" \r\n<em>Id</em>. at 772.  The appellate court thus characterized defense counsel's argument as making \"improper\r\nappeals to race [and] nationalism,\" which the supreme court has specifically cited as forms of\r\nincurable argument.  <em>See id</em>.  Here, in contrast, the \"terrorism\" comment did not involve an appeal\r\nto race or nationalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also cites <em>Mills v. State</em>, No. 07-08-00348-CR, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3320249</span></span>, at *3\r\n(Tex. App.--Amarillo Oct. 14, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication),\r\nin support of the argument that \"terrorist\" comparisons necessarily cause incurable harm.  <em>Mills</em>\r\nis distinguishable because it involved a prosecutor directly comparing a criminal defendant to\r\n9/11 hijacker Muhammed Atta.  <em>See id</em>. at *1.  In the same breath, the prosecutor also compared\r\nthe defendant to serial killers John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer.  <em>Id</em>.  We think it obvious that,\r\nespecially in the criminal context, such comparisons are far more egregious than a comment during a\r\ncivil trial that negotiating with an opponent is \"like\" negotiating with a terrorist.  In sum, we are not\r\npersuaded that the \"terrorist\" comment represented incurable harm.  The comment was analogical,\r\noccurred only once, and was quickly clarified with an explanation that was arguably supported by\r\nthe evidence.  <em>Cf</em>. <em>Reese</em>, 584 S.W.2d at 839-40 (noting whether improper argument caused incurable\r\nharm depends on nature, degree and extent of error).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFinally, Chad complains about the personal epithets Kirk's attorney directed at him.\r\nHe argues that these epithets collectively caused incurable harm, especially when coupled\r\nwith the statements described above.  Having reviewed the entirety of the record, we find that the\r\ncomplained-of epithets, while arguably inappropriate, do not rise to the level of creating incurable\r\nharm in light of the facts of this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn sum, we do not agree that Kirk's attorney's jury arguments were so extreme and\r\nunsupported as to represent incurable error.  We overrule Chad's first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>2.  Whether Chad's Letters to the Phillipses Were Protected by the Common-Interest Privilege</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad's second point on appeal asserts that the trial court erred by allowing Kirk to\r\nrecover damages for the statements Chad made in his letters to the Phillipses, who purchased a\r\nmausoleum site from Kirk.  Chad argues that the statements cannot be defamatory because he had\r\na \"common interest\" with the Phillipses, making his statements privileged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tA \"common-interest\" privilege is \"granted to statements that occur under\r\ncircumstances wherein any one of several persons having a common interest in a particular\r\nsubject matter may reasonably believe that facts exist that another, sharing that common\r\ninterest, is entitled to know.\"  <em>Hanssen v. Our Redeemer Lutheran Church</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369709\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369709/hanssen-v-our-redeemer-lutheran-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 92\r\n(Tex. App.--Dallas 1996, writ denied).  A statement qualifies for the common-interest privilege only\r\nif it is made \"for the purpose of protecting the common interest.\"  <em>Grant v. Stop-N-Go Mkt. of Tex.,\r\nInc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454689\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454689/grant-v-stop-n-go-market-of-texas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 874 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.).  A statement that meets\r\nthese criteria is presumed to have been made in good faith and without malice, meaning that\r\nit cannot support recovery in defamation unless the presumption of good faith is overcome.  <em>See\r\nMarathon Oil Co. v. Salazar</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460854\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460854/marathon-oil-co-v-salazar/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 630 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.).  A plaintiff may overcome the common-interest presumption of good faith with a showing\r\nof \"actual malice,\" i.e., a showing that the statement was published \"with knowledge of its falsity\r\nor with reckless disregard as to its truth.\"  <em>Grant</em>, 994 S.W.2d at 874.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that he shared a common interest with the Phillipses because Kirk\r\nhad sold the Phillipses mausoleums in the Burbage family cemetery.  Thus, argues Chad, he and the\r\nPhillipses shared an interest in ensuring that Kirk had not been selling rights to the family's cemetery\r\nland without legal authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAt the outset of a common-interest analysis, we note that Chad's interest in\r\nkeeping the Phillipses out of the family cemetery was antithetical to the Phillipses' interest in owning\r\ntheir cemetery spaces.  But even if we assume that Chad is right about having a common interest\r\nwith the Phillipses, at least some of his allegedly defamatory statements to the Phillipses were\r\nclearly not made \"for the purpose of protecting the common interest.\"  <em>See Grant</em>, 994 S.W.2d\r\nat 874.  Specifically, the following statements in Chad's letters have no arguable relation to Kirk's\r\nsale of mausoleums to the Phillipses:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\"Kirk Burbage has committed numerous abuses to family members.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>\"Kirk Burbage fraudulently obtained a Quit Claim [deed] from our mother<em> by\r\nwhat is believed to be elder abuse</em>.\"</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Clearly, these statements (at a minimum) were not subject to the common-interest privilege.  <em>See id</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that if even <em>some</em> of his statements to the Phillipses were protected by the\r\ncommon-interest privilege then we must reverse the judgment.  He bases this argument on the fact\r\nthat the trial court submitted broad-form damages questions to the jury rather than segregating the\r\ndamages by statement.  However, Chad did not object in the trial court to the submission of broad-form damages questions, so we cannot reverse on the basis that the broad-form damages questions\r\nmay have included both valid and invalid grounds for recovery.  <em>See In re B.L.D.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1868222\"><a href=\"/opinion/1868222/in-re-bld/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>,\r\n349 (Tex. 2003) (holding that complaints of error in broad-form submission must be preserved\r\nby objection at trial).  Thus, even if we were inclined to find that some of Chad's statements were\r\nprotected by the common-interest privilege, which we are not, the jury's broad-form findings would\r\nbe well supported by other statements.  We therefore overrule Chad's second appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>3.  Whether the Damages Awards are Unsupported by the Evidence and Excessive</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his third issue, Chad argues that Kirk's non-economic, compensatory\r\ndamages award was unsupported by the evidence and excessive under the First Amendment.  He\r\nalso argues that Kirk's exemplary damages award was excessive under Texas statute and\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  We will address the compensatory and exemplary damages awards\r\nseparately.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<strong><em>Compensatory Damages</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that the jury's award of roughly $3,800,000 in compensatory damages\r\nto Kirk was excessive and unreasonable because there was little evidence that Kirk's reputation was\r\nactually harmed or would continue to be harmed in the future.  Specifically, Chad argues that there\r\nwas no evidence as to how many people had viewed his website while it was operative, and the fact\r\nthat the website was taken down long before trial meant that future reputational harm was especially\r\nunlikely.  Chad argues that Kirk produced no evidence to substantiate that his reputation or business\r\nhad actually been harmed by Chad's statements.  While Kirk testified that a few customers canceled\r\ntheir prepaid funeral arrangements after Chad published his statements, Chad argues that Kirk\r\nproduced no evidence to substantiate these cancellations or tie them directly to Chad's statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad contrasts the damages awarded to Kirk with those awarded to the plaintiff in\r\n<em>Bentley v. Bunton</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773871\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773871/bentley-v-bunton/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span> (Tex. 2002).  In <em>Bentley</em>, a judge sued a television personality who\r\nhad broadcast several defamatory statements about the judge over a long period of time.  <em>Id</em>. at 567-74.  The judge presented significant evidence that the statements had been widely heard and had\r\nactually harmed his reputation.  <em>Id</em>. at 570-73.  A jury awarded him $175,000 in damages based on\r\npast and future reputational harm.  <em>Id</em>. at 576.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that in <em>Bentley</em> the harm was much better established than the harm\r\nhere, yet the damages award was much smaller, suggesting that Kirk's compensatory damages award\r\nwas excessive.  At issue in <em>Bentley</em>, though, was one public servant's reputation.  Here, in contrast,\r\nthe jury was presented with evidence that Chad's statements harmed the reputation not only of a\r\nprivate individual, but also of a well-established, long-running business with considerable goodwill\r\nbuilt up in its community.  As such, the damages awarded in <em>Bentley</em> do not necessarily guide the\r\nappropriate damages here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tRather, in reviewing Kirk's compensatory damages award, we follow the general\r\nrule that the jury is afforded significant latitude in determining the proper measure of damages.  <em>Id</em>.\r\nat 605.  We review a damages award for whether it is excessive, unsupported by the evidence,\r\nor unreasonable.  <em>Id</em>. at 605-06.  There must be some evidence to justify the amount awarded, and\r\nthat amount must \"fairly and reasonably\" compensate for the loss incurred.  <em>Id</em>. at 606.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHaving reviewed the entire record, we cannot say that Kirk's compensatory damages\r\naward is excessive or unreasonable.  First, Kirk testified that Chad's defamatory accusations were\r\n\"all over town.\"  Second, Chad conceded that his accusations would \"have significant repercussions\r\non Kirk's business.\"  Third, Kirk testified that the Burbage Funeral Home had a market value of\r\nat least $3 million and that this value would likely be lost because of Chad's statements.  Chad\r\ncomplains that this testimony was not substantiated with documentary evidence, but no such\r\nrequirement exists.  Rather, the jury had latitude to use Kirk's testimony as a basis for calculating\r\ncompensatory damages.  We therefore hold that the jury's compensatory damages award to Kirk did\r\nnot lack evidentiary support.  <em>See id</em>.  Chad also argues that the First Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution prohibits \"excessive noneconomic damages awards in defamation cases because they\r\nthreaten to inhibit constitutionally protected speech.\"  Having just determined that the compensatory\r\ndamages awarded here were not excessive, we find Chad's First Amendment argument unpersuasive.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<strong><em>Exemplary Damages</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t<strong><em>Texas Statute</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad argues that the jury's nearly $6 million exemplary damages award to Kirk is\r\nexcessive under Texas law.  We agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code article 41.008(b) provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Exemplary damages awarded against a defendant may not exceed an amount equal\r\nto the greater of:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>(1) \t(A) two times the amount of economic damages; plus </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t(B) an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\r\nexceed $750,000; or </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>(2) \t$200,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. art. 41.008(b).  Bearing in mind that no economic damages were\r\nawarded here, this statute plainly limits Kirk to $750,000 in exemplary damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tKirk argues that article 41.008(b) does not apply here because Chad did not invoke\r\nit in the trial court.  But Chad's amended answer explicitly stated that \"[i]f the Defendant is found\r\nliable for exemplary damages, those damages must be capped under the Texas Damages Act.\"  We\r\ntherefore modify the exemplary damages award to $750,000 to accord with Texas's statutory\r\nexemplary-damage cap. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t<strong><em>The Fourteenth Amendment</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that the exemplary damages award violates the Due Process\r\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment by its sheer size.  It is true that an excessive exemplary\r\ndamages award may deprive a litigant of due process.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>,\r\n212 S.W.3d 299, 307-08 (Tex. 2006).  \"In reviewing the amount of an exemplary damage award\r\nfor constitutionality, we have been directed to consider three 'guideposts':  (1) the nature of the\r\ndefendant's conduct, (2) the ratio between exemplary and compensatory damages, and (3) the size\r\nof civil penalties in comparable cases.\"  <em>Id</em>. at 308.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThese guideposts do not suggest that an exemplary damages award modified\r\nto $750,000 is unconstitutional.  <em>Cf. id</em>.  Regarding the first guidepost, the jury found that Chad\r\nmaliciously and repeatedly published statements accusing his brother of heinous crimes knowing\r\nthat his brother worked in an industry where reputation is paramount.  <em>Cf. id</em>. (concluding that\r\nreprehensibility of defendant's conduct depends in part on whether defendant's conduct involved\r\nrepeated acts, threatened financial ruin, and resulted from malice).  Regarding the second guidepost,\r\na $750,000 exemplary damages award is far less than the roughly $3,800,000 compensatory damages\r\naward that we have already determined not to be excessive.  <em>Cf. id</em>. (suggesting that exemplary-to-compensatory-damages ratio of more than four to one probably unconstitutional).  Regarding the\r\nthird guidepost, Chad has not pointed us to a single case where, as here, defamatory statements\r\nthreatened to harm a multi-million-dollar business.  Thus, he has provided us no basis for concluding\r\nthat a $750,000 exemplary damages award is incommensurate with the damages awards in\r\n\"comparable\" cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tChad also argues that Kirk's exemplary damages award violates the\r\nFourteenth Amendment because it was based \"in part upon [the jury's] desire to punish the defendant\r\nfor harming persons who are not before the court.\"  <em>Philip Morris USA v. Williams</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145758\"><a href=\"/opinion/145758/philip-morris-usa-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>,\r\n349 (2007) (emphasis deleted).  Specifically, Chad argues that the exemplary damages award was\r\npartially based on the jury's desire to punish Chad for harming his grandmother, Anna Burbage, who\r\nwas not a party to the lawsuit.  Chad notes that Kirk emphasized Anna Burbage's status, legacy, and\r\nreputation throughout the trial.  This emphasis, however, also spoke directly to the harm done to the\r\nBurbage Funeral Home (which <em>was</em> a party to the lawsuit) because its community standing derived\r\nlargely from its connection with Anna Burbage.  We therefore see no basis for concluding that the\r\nemphasis on Anna Burbage's status, legacy, and reputation persuaded the jury to consider anything\r\nother than the harm to Kirk and the Burbage Funeral Home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn sum, we agree with Chad that Kirk's exemplary damages award must be reduced\r\nto $750,000 to accord with Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code article 41.008(b).  Beyond that,\r\nwe reject Chad's arguments that the jury's exemplary damages award was improper.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Whether the Permanent Injunction is Unconstitutional</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFinally, Chad argues that the permanent injunction imposed by the trial court\r\nrepresents an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.  The court simply signed without altering\r\na proposed injunction that Kirk submitted.  That injunction permanently enjoined Chad from\r\n\"publishing, disseminating or causing to be published or disseminated, whether directly or indirectly,\r\nto third-parties by any means, whether verbal or in writing, any statement or representation that\r\nstates, implies or suggests in whole or in part\" anything \"of the same or similar nature as [the\r\nrepresentations] at issue in this lawsuit.\"  The permanent injunction includes a roughly four-page list\r\nof prohibited subjects.  We agree with Chad that the injunction is unconstitutional. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tA prior restraint is a \"judicial order[] forbidding certain communications when\r\nissued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\"  <em>Alexander v. United States</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112902\"><a href=\"/opinion/112902/alexander-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 550 (1993) (emphasis deleted).  Such orders are highly disfavored under federal law\r\nand even more highly disfavored under Texas law.  <em>See Davenport v. Garcia</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1495397\"><a href=\"/opinion/1495397/davenport-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 10\r\n(Tex. 1992).  Thus, defamatory speech is not sufficiently injurious to warrant prior restraint.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>,<em> Hajek v. Bill Mowbray Motors, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1782689\"><a href=\"/opinion/1782689/hajek-v-bill-mowbray-motors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 255 (Tex. 1983) (per curiam)\r\n(\"Defamation alone is not a sufficient justification for restraining an individual's right to speak\r\nfreely.\");<em> Brammer v. KB Home Lone Star, L.P.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2194247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2194247/brammer-v-kb-home-lone-star-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 107 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003,\r\nno pet.) (concluding that harm resulting from defamation does not rise to level necessary to\r\nmake prior restraint constitutional).  We therefore vacate the permanent injunction entered by the\r\ntrial court.<strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\tFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the compensatory damages award, modify\r\nthe exemplary damages award to $750,000, and vacate the permanent injunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Rose, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Justices Puryear, Pemberton and Rose</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affirmed in part; Modified and, as Modified, Affirmed in part; Vacated in part</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filed:   December 21, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
