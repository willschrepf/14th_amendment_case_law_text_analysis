Custodial Funds.\n\n(a) Custodial Funds [funds] must be deposited in a Custodial Account [custodial account].\n\n (b) Qualified Funds [funds] are Custodial Funds [custodial funds] that, in the Good Faith\n[good faith] judgment of the Judicial Official [judicial official], are nominal in amount or are\nreasonably expected to be held for such a short period of time that sufficient [interest] income\nwill not be generated to justify the expense of earning [interest] income to benefit the Beneficial\nOwner [beneficial owner] of the funds.

Special Provisions Applicable to Custodial Accounts of Magisterial District Judges.\n\n (a) Each Magisterial District Judge [magisterial district judge] must use the statewide\ncomputerized reporting system of the AOPC for reporting all transactions which occur through\nhis or her [custodial account] Custodial Account. As of the date of these [regulations]\nRegulations, the AOPC Magisterial District Judge Case Reporting System [case reporting\nsystem] is incapable of handling more than one Custodial Account [custodial account] per\nMagisterial District Judge [magisterial district judge], meaning that each Magisterial\nDistrict Judge [magisterial district judge] may maintain only one Custodial Account\n[custodial account].\n\n (b) Custodial Funds [funds] received by a Magisterial District Judge [magisterial district\njudge] will generally be Qualified Funds [qualified funds]. Magisterial District Judges,\nhowever, may determine that particular Custodial Funds [custodial funds] received are not, in\nfact, Qualified Funds [qualified funds], applying the criteria set forth in § 81.304.\n\n (c) Each Magisterial District Judge [magisterial district judge] is permitted to exercise his or\nher judgment as to whether Custodial Funds [custodial funds] received by that Magisterial\nDistrict Judge [magisterial district judge] are Qualified Funds [qualified funds]. If, in the\nGood Faith [good faith] judgment of the Magisterial District Judge [magisterial district\njudge], Custodial Funds [custodial funds] are not Qualified Funds [qualified funds], the\nMagisterial District Judge [magisterial district judge] may request a refund of [interest]\nincome with respect to those Custodial Funds [custodial funds]. See § 81.308—Refunds.\n\n (d) If, in the future, the AOPC Magisterial District Judge Case Reporting System\n[magisterial district judge case reporting system] permits handling of multiple Custodial\nAccounts [custodial accounts] for each Magisterial District Judge [magisterial district\njudge], the provisions of this section shall no longer apply, although Magisterial District\nJudges [magisterial district judges] shall remain subject to the remaining provisions of these\n[regulations] Regulations.\n\n§ 81.306. Requirements Applicable to MJ-IOTA Accounts.\n\n                                                6\n\f (a) Unless an exemption has been granted to the Judicial Official [judicial official], each\nJudicial Official [judicial official] shall establish [a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account] at the\nDepository Institution [depository institution] of his or her choice, provided that the\nDepository Institution complies with the MJ-IOTA Regulations. If local county policies and\nprocedures concerning accounts established by the Judicial Official [judicial official] exist,\nnothing herein shall be construed as relieving the Judicial Official [judicial official] of\ncomplying with such policies and procedures, except to the extent inconsistent herewith.\n\n (b) In order to qualify an account as [a] an MJ-IOTA Account, the Depository Institution\n[depository institution] must[:] satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 81.301(c) above.\n\n [(1) Remit monthly any interest earned on the account to the Board, or if that is not\npossible, remit the interest earned at least quarterly; and]\n\n  [(2) Transmit to the Board with each remittance a statement showing not less than the\nfollowing information: the name of the account, the account number, the service charges\nand/or fees deducted, if any, from the account, the amount of interest remitted from the\naccount, and if available, the average daily collected balance in the account for the period\nreported.]\n\n(c) The following additional requirements apply to MJ-IOTA Accounts [accounts]:\n\n  [(1) The rate of interest paid on MJ-IOTA Accounts shall be not less than the highest\nrate of interest generally available from the depository institution to depositors generally\nfor accounts with the same minimum balance and other account eligibility requirements.]\n\n  [(2) Under no circumstances may the rate of interest payable on a MJ-IOTA account be\nless than the rate paid by the depository institution on negotiable order of withdrawal\naccounts or super negotiable order of withdrawal accounts.]\n\n  [(3) The accounts must continue to be collateralized by the assets of the depository\ninstitution in accordance with current practice and Act 72 of 1971.]\n\n  (1) A Depository Institution shall submit to the IOLTA Board for review and approval a\nCompliance Certification Form, which identifies the rate of interest or dividend to be\nprovided for MJ-IOTA Accounts and certifies the Depository Institution’s compliance with\nthe MJ-IOTA Regulations and the IOLTA Board’s Comparability Guidance. Prior to\nchanging a rate that was previously approved by the IOLTA Board, or when the rates for\ncomparable products exceed the rate listed in the Depository Institution’s most recently\napproved Compliance Certification Form, the Depository Institution shall submit a new\nCompliance Certification Form to the IOLTA Board for review and approval.\n\n  (2) Depository Institutions shall grant requests by the IOLTA Board to recover income\nthat was not remitted to the IOLTA Board, in accordance with the Depository Institution’s\nmost recently approved Compliance Certification Form, during the twelve months\npreceding the IOLTA Board’s request.\n\n                                               7\n\f (d) Depository Institutions [institutions] may impose reasonable service charges for the\nadministration of MJ-IOTA Accounts [accounts].\n\n  (1) A Depository Institution [depository institution] may deduct service charges such as\nmaintenance fees and transaction charges against the amount of [interest] income to be paid on\nthe MJ-IOTA Account [account] to which service charges apply.\n\n  (2) All costs associated with check printing, overdraft charges, charges for a temporary\nextension of credit, stopped payments, certified checks, wire transfers and similar bank\ncharges shall not be assessed against [funds] Qualified Funds in or [interest] income earned on\n[a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account].\n\n  [(3) All costs for services such as overdrafts on deposited items, stopped payments,\ncertified checks, and wire transfers shall not be assessed against funds in or interest earned\non a MJ-IOTA account.]\n\n§ 81.307. Exemptions from MJ-IOTA Participation.\n\n (a) The IOLTA Board may grant exemptions from participation in the MJ-IOTA Program.\nExemptions are not automatic. The IOLTA Board may declare a Judicial Official [judicial\nofficial] exempt from the requirements of maintaining [a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account].\nAlternatively, a Judicial Official [judicial official] may submit a written request for exemption.\nAll requests by a Judicial Official [judicial official] must be made on the Judicial Official’s\n[judicial official’s] official letterhead, and all requests must set forth in reasonable detail the\nbasis for the requested exemption.\n\n (b) Exemptions may be granted only with respect to the maintenance of [a] an MJ-IOTA\nAccount [account] for Qualified Funds [qualified funds]. The IOLTA Board is not\nempowered to handle other types of exemptions. Judicial Officials [officials] exempt from\nmaintenance of [a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account] are reminded that the Judicial Official\n[judicial official] remains subject to other requirements pertaining to Custodial Funds\n[custodial funds].\n\n(c) Exemptions will be routinely granted in the following situations:\n\n  (1) Low balance account: Any Custodial Account [custodial account] which historically,\ngenerally based upon 12 consecutive months of activity, has an average daily balance of three\nthousand five hundred ($3,500) Dollars or less will be exempt from being [a] an MJ-IOTA\nAccount [account]. The IOLTA Board may exempt from the MJ-IOTA Program, without\napplication, a low balance account. A Judicial Official [judicial official] requesting an\nexemption based on a low balance account must, as a part of the written request for exemption,\ninclude an account analysis or written statement that demonstrates the amount of the average\ndaily balance.\n\n  (2) Account service charges routinely exceed [interest] income: Some Custodial Accounts\n[custodial accounts] may have an average daily balance of more than $3,500, but account\n\n                                                 8\n\fservice charges routinely exceed the [interest] income earned on the account. A Judicial\nOfficial [judicial official] requesting an exemption under this subsection, as part of the written\nrequest for exemption, must include an account analysis or written statement that clearly shows\nthe [interest] income earned, or the [interest] income that would have been earned, on the\naccount each month for the past 12 months, plus the account service charges imposed on the\naccount for each of the last 12 months. Only account-related service charges will be considered\nfor the purpose of whether an exemption will be granted.\n\n  (3) Extreme impracticality: Under limited circumstances it may be unduly burdensome for a\nJudicial Official [judicial official] to maintain [a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account]. When\nclaiming undue hardship, the Judicial Official [judicial official] should provide appropriate\ndetail demonstrating undue hardship. An example includes the lack of a Depository Institution\n[depository institution] that offers MJ-IOTA Accounts [accounts] in the Judicial Official’s\n[judicial official’s] geographical location.\n\n  (4) Other compelling and necessitous reasons: A Judicial Official [judicial official] who\ndemonstrates a compelling and necessitous reason for not complying with the MJ-IOTA\nProgram may request an exemption. A philosophical objection to the MJ-IOTA Program does\nnot constitute a compelling and necessitous reason for an exemption.\n\n (d) If the IOLTA Board denies a Judicial Official’s [judicial official’s] request for an\nexemption from maintenance of [a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account], the Judicial Official\n[judicial official] may, within 30 days of written notice of denial from the IOLTA Board,\nrequest in writing a reconsideration of the IOLTA Board’s decision. All requests for\nreconsideration shall set forth in detail additional facts, if any, not brought before the IOLTA\nBoard in the request for exemption, as well as the reasons, if any, why an exemption should be\ngranted.\n\n (e) If the IOLTA Board has determined that a Judicial Official’s [judicial official’s]\nCustodial Account [custodial account] is exempt from the MJ-IOTA [status] Program, the\nJudicial Official [judicial official] may, within 30 days of written notice from the IOLTA\nBoard that the Judicial Official [judicial official] is exempt, request in writing a reconsideration\nof the IOLTA Board’s decision. All requests for reconsideration shall set forth in detail facts, if\nany, why the Judicial Official [judicial official] should maintain [a] an MJ-IOTA Account\n[account], and the manner, if any, in which the IOLTA Board and the purposes of the MJ-IOTA\nProgram [program] will be [by] furthered by the Judicial Official’s [judicial official’s]\nmaintenance of [a] an MJ-IOTA Account [account].\n\n (f) Notice shall be deemed to have been given to a Judicial Official [judicial official] under\nthe provisions of this Section upon the deposit by the IOLTA Board, postage prepaid, with the\nUnited States Postal Service of its written determination regarding the exemption, if any, of the\nJudicial Official [judicial official] from the MJ-IOTA Program.\n\n (g) The IOLTA Board may delegate to its staff or to a committee of the IOLTA Board the\nauthority to determine exemptions from the MJ-IOTA Program or to reconsider exemption\ndenials or determinations.\n\n                                                 9\n\f§ 81.308. Refunds.\n\n (a) [Upon application of a judicial official, the] The IOLTA Board may return [interest]\nincome paid to [it] the IOLTA Board under certain circumstances. For example, if a Judicial\nOfficial [judicial official] mistakenly places Custodial Funds [custodial funds] which are not\nQualified Funds [qualified funds] in an MJ-IOTA [account,] Account, then the Judicial\nOfficial may apply to the IOLTA Board for a refund of the [interest earned on those funds\nmay be refunded] income paid to the IOLTA Board.\n\n (b) At the time of the issuance of these [regulations] Regulations, all Custodial Funds\n[custodial funds] handled by Magisterial District Judges are anticipated to be Qualified Funds\n[qualified funds]. Magisterial District Judges occasionally may determine that certain Custodial\nFunds [custodial funds] maintained in their Custodial Account [custodial account] do not\nmeet this presumption, and are not Qualified Funds [qualified funds]. Upon application of the\nMagisterial District Judge, the IOLTA Board may return [interest] income paid to it applicable\nto the funds which were not Qualified Funds [qualified funds].\n\n(c) The following guidelines apply to requests for a refund of [interest] income:\n\n  (1) [All requests] Requests by a Judicial Official [judicial official] must be made on the\nJudicial Official’s [judicial official’s] official letterhead, and all requests must set forth in\nreasonable detail the basis for the requested refund[;].\n\n  (2) [The request] Requests must be accompanied by verification of the [interest] income\npaid with respect to the funds mistakenly placed in the MJ-IOTA Account [account].\nVerification must be made by the Depository Institution [depository institution] in which the\nMJ-IOTA Account [account] is maintained. As needed for auditing purposes, the IOLTA Board\nmay request additional documentation[;].\n\n [(3) The request must be made within six months after the beneficial owner’s funds have\nbeen disbursed from the MJ- IOTA account;]\n\n  (3) The IOLTA Board will only consider requests where the income to be refunded was\nreceived by the IOLTA Board during the twelve-month period prior to the IOLTA Board\nreceiving the written request for a refund.\n\n  (4) Refunds will be remitted [to the beneficial owner] through the Depository Institution\nthat transmitted the income to the IOLTA Board unless an alternative method is requested\nand [the Board will issue an IRS (Internal Revenue Service) form 1099 to the beneficial\nowner;] agreed to by the IOLTA Board.\n\n  (5) If the Depository Institution [depository institution] has imposed a service charge with\nrespect to the MJ-IOTA Account [account], only the net amount of [interest] income paid to\nthe IOLTA Board (i.e., the [interest] income reduced by applicable service charges) will be\nrefunded[; and].\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f(6) The IOLTA Board may impose and deduct a processing charge from the refund.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f",
