See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nJohn Walsh, an inmate currently in the custody of Maryland's\nDivision of Correction (DOC), appeals the order of the district court\ndenying his petition for writ of habeas corpus. He claims that the\n1977 revisions to Maryland's Patuxent statute violated the Ex Post\nFacto Clause in two ways. First, he contends that the revisions\nincreased the measure of punishment for his crimes by transforming\nhis civil commitment at Maryland's Patuxent Institution (Patuxent),\na psychiatric treatment facility for Maryland inmates, into a punitive\nincarceration. Second, he claims that the revisions violated the Ex\nPost Facto Clause by eliminating his opportunity to gain early,\nunconditional release from state custody once he had recovered suffi-\nciently from his status as a \"defective delinquent\" for the staff at\nPatuxent to recommend that he be discharged. Finally, he asserts that\nhis transfer from Patuxent to the general prison population in the\nDOC deprived him of a state-created liberty interest in remaining at\nPatuxent and receiving its treatment programs that is protected by the\nDue Process Clause. Because we find that the revisions actually\ndecreased the potential length of his confinement, and that the revi-\nsions did not eliminate his opportunity to gain early release from state\ncustody during his years in confinement at Patuxent, we agree with\nthe district court that the 1977 revisions do not run afoul of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. Furthermore, because we find that Walsh's\n\n                    2\n\fremoval from Patuxent did not result in Walsh's experiencing a sig-\nnificant and atypical hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life, we agree with the district court that Walsh was not\ndeprived of a state-created liberty interest. Accordingly, we affirm the\ndistrict court's denial of Walsh's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nI.\n\nIn 1970, John Walsh was convicted, upon entering a guilty plea, of\nrape and kidnapping in Maryland state court and sentenced to a\nseventy-two-year term of imprisonment. In 1971, he was committed\nto Patuxent. Under Maryland law in effect before 1977, a prosecutor,\nthe DOC, or a previously sentenced defendant could file a request\nwith the sentencing court asking that the defendant be examined at\nPatuxent, a mental institution, to determine whether he qualified for\nadmission to Patuxent as a \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann.\nCode art. 31B § 6(b) (1971). Upon such a request, or upon its own\ninitiative, the sentencing court could order that a defendant be evalu-\nated by the Patuxent staff. See id.1 Under the former Patuxent statute,2\na \"defective delinquent\" was defined as:\n\n          an individual who, by the demonstration of persistent aggra-\n          vated antisocial or criminal behavior, evidences a propensity\n          toward criminal activity, and who is found to have either\n          such intellectual deficiency or emotional unbalance, or both,\n          as to clearly demonstrate an actual danger to society so as\n          to require such confinement and treatment, when appropri-\n          ate, as may make it reasonably safe for society to terminate\n          the confinement and treatment.\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Appellees do not dispute Walsh's assertion that his sentencing court\nrecommended, as part of a plea agreement, that he be evaluated by the\nPatuxent staff. In any event, the question of who recommended that\nWalsh be evaluated is irrelevant to the issues presented by this appeal.\n2 This opinion refers to those provisions of Maryland law governing the\nadministration of Patuxent as the Patuxent statute. These provisions,\nwhich have obviously changed in content over the years, were formerly\ncodified at Article 31B of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957), but\nare now located in the Correctional Services Article of the Annotated\nCode of Maryland.\n\n                    3\n\fMd. Ann. Code art. 31B § 5 (1971). If the staff concluded that the\ndefendant was a \"defective delinquent,\" the sentencing court con-\nducted a trial on the issue of whether the defendant was a \"defective\ndelinquent.\" If the court found that the defendant was a \"defective delin-\nquent,\"3 the defendant was committed to Patuxent \"for an indetermi-\nnate period without either maximum or minimum limits\" and his\noriginal sentence was suspended. Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 9(b)\n(1971).\n\nWhile at Patuxent, inmates received psychiatric treatment for the\nmental affliction that made them \"defective delinquents.\" Patuxent's\nInstitutional Board of Review (IBR)4 then reviewed the status of the\n\"delinquent\" at least once every calendar year. See Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13(b) (1971). Under the statute, the IBR could grant a leave\nof absence or parole, if it found that parole was for the inmate's bene-\nfit and the benefit of society, or recommend the inmate's uncondi-\ntional release from custody as a \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann.\nCode art. 31B §§ 13(d) and (f) (1971). Upon the IBR's recommenda-\ntion that an inmate be unconditionally released from custody as a \"de-\nfective delinquent,\" the sentencing court not only possessed the\nauthority to order an unconditional release, but it could also order that\nthe inmate be paroled, granted a leave of absence, returned to Patux-\nent, or transferred to the DOC to serve out his original sentence. See\nMd. Ann. Code art. 31B § 13(f) (1971). When the sentencing court\nchose to reimpose the original sentence and transfer a defendant to the\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 A defendant could request a jury trial on the issue of whether he was\na \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 8(c) (1971). In\nthat case, the jury, not the court, would decide the issue. See Md. Ann.\nCode art. 31B, § 9(a) (1971).\n4 The IBR's members included the director of Patuxent, the three asso-\nciate directors, a professor from the University of Maryland School of\nLaw who was a member of the advisory board of Patuxent, either of the\nmembers of the Maryland bar who were members of Patuxent's advisory\nboard, and a sociologist. See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 12 (1971).\nAlthough the positions from which the IBR draws its membership have\nchanged over the years -- for example, the IBR now includes the warden\nof Patuxent and members of the public, but does not include a law pro-\nfessor or a sociologist, see Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-\n205 (1999) -- Walsh does not allege that this change in composition\nresulted in any constitutional violation.\n\n                    4\n\fDOC, the defendant was entitled to credit against that sentence for\ntime spent at Patuxent. See id.\n\nPatuxent inmates were also allowed to petition a state court for\nreview of their status, beginning two years after their initial confine-\nment to the Institution but not before two-thirds of their sentence had\nexpired. See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, § 10(a) (1971). The inmate was\nbrought before a court and permitted to request a jury, which would\ndetermine whether he was still a \"defective delinquent.\" See id. If\nfound to be a \"defective delinquent,\" he was returned to Patuxent;\nhowever, if the jury found that he was no longer a\"defective delin-\nquent,\" the court could release him unconditionally or commit him to\nthe DOC under his original sentence, with credit for time served at\nPatuxent. See id.\n\nIn 1977, the Patuxent statute underwent major revisions in the\nwake of criticism that inmates at Patuxent, who served indeterminate\nsentences and were released only after they were no longer \"defective\ndelinquents,\" often remained in confinement at Patuxent long after\ntheir original sentences had expired. See Gluckstern v. Sutton, 574\nA.2d 898, 901 (Md. 1990). In re-writing the statute, the state legisla-\nture provided that a Patuxent inmate's original sentence was no longer\nsuspended when he entered Patuxent; thus, when he served the length\nof his original sentence, he was entitled to be released. See Md. Code\nAnn., Correctional Services § 4-304(a) (1999). 5 Indeterminate sen-\ntences for inmates at Patuxent were eliminated.\n\nThe legislature made other changes to the statute. Under the re-\nwritten provisions, a person committed to Patuxent was not commit-\nted as a \"defective delinquent,\" but as an\"eligible person.\" An \"eligi-\nble person\" is defined as\n\n           an individual who, (i) has been convicted of a crime and is\n           serving a sentence of imprisonment with at least 3 years\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 All citations to the post-1977 Patuxent statute are to the current\n(1999) Annotated Code of Maryland. Although they have been recently\ntransplanted from former Article 31B to the Correctional Services Arti-\ncle, the contents of the relevant sections have remained substantively\nunchanged since 1977.\n\n                    5\n\f         remaining on the sentence; (ii) has an intellectual impair-\n         ment or emotional imbalance; (iii) is likely to respond favor-\n         ably to the programs and services that the Institution\n         provides; (iv) can better respond to remediation through\n         those programs and services than by other incarceration; and\n         (v) meets the eligibility criteria that the Secretary establishes\n         under § 4-208 of this title.\n\nMd. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-101(e) (1999).6 No longer\ndid sentencing courts determine whether a defendant was a \"defective\ndelinquent\" upon receiving a recommendation from the staff of Patux-\nent. Instead, the Patuxent staff itself assumed complete control over\nwhom to admit as an \"eligible person.\" See Md. Code Ann., Correc-\ntional Services §§ 4-301, 302(b) (1999). The IBR continued to con-\nduct annual reviews of the inmates, see Md. Code Ann., Correctional\nServices § 4-302(d), and it retained the discretion to grant parole\nwhen parole would not impose an unreasonable risk to society and\nwould aid in the remediation of an \"eligible person.\" See Md. Code\nAnn., Correctional Services § 4-305 (1999). As noted above, under\nthe old statute, Maryland courts could choose to release a Patuxent\ninmate unconditionally upon the IBR's recommendation following its\nannual review of the inmate. Under the revised statute, Maryland\ncourts retained their discretion to order an unconditional release upon\nreceiving a recommendation from the IBR. The IBR, however, could\nnot make a recommendation for unconditional release until after the\ninmate had successfully served three years on parole without a viola-\ntion. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-305(f). The revi-\nsions also eliminated the ability of a prisoner at Patuxent to petition\na court to review his status following the expiration of two-thirds of\nhis original sentence. Finally, under the revised statute, the IBR could\ndetermine that an inmate was no longer an \"eligible person\" and then\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 The 1977 revisions did not include part (v) of the definition. Part (v)\nrefers to Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-208 (1999), which\nallows the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services to adopt\nregulations to carry out the provisions of Title 4 of the Correctional Ser-\nvices Article. Since 1977, there have also been some minor, non-\nsubstantive, changes to the wording of the definition. Walsh does not\nargue that these subsequent changes somehow enhanced the alleged con-\nstitutional violations caused by the 1977 revisions.\n\n                   6\n\ftransfer a prisoner to the DOC without first petitioning the inmate's\nsentencing court. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services §§ 4-\n306(b)(2) and (b)(3) (1999).\n\nThe revised statute also included a transitional provision to reim-\npose the original sentences of inmates committed before July 1977.\nUnder the revised statute, Walsh's seventy-two-year sentence was\n\"reimposed as of the time it was originally entered, with credit for\ntime spent at the Institution.\" Md. Ann. Code of 1957, art. 31B\n§ 16(b)(1) (1983). After reimposition of his sentence in 1977, Walsh\nremained at Patuxent until September 28, 1990, when the IBR deter-\nmined that he was no longer an \"eligible person.\" Walsh was then\ntransferred to the DOC to serve out the remainder of his seventy-two-\nyear sentence.\n\nIn 1998, Walsh filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland. Among\nother grounds for relief not pertinent here, Walsh asserted that the\n1977 legislative changes to the Patuxent statute violated the Ex Post\nFacto Clause and denied him due process by depriving him of an\nalleged liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent and receiving its\ntreatment programs.7 After the district court denied the petition and\ndenied Walsh's request for a certificate of appealability, we granted\na certificate of appealability on his ex post facto and due process\nclaims.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 In 1995, Walsh filed a habeas petition in which he raised the same\narguments contained in his 1998 petition. The district court dismissed the\npetition without prejudice because Walsh had not raised a challenge to\nthe 1977 revisions in state post-conviction proceedings. When Walsh\nrefiled his petition in 1998, the state conceded that Walsh had exhausted\nhis available state remedies in state post-conviction proceedings, and the\ndistrict court proceeded to the merits of his claims.\n\nIn 1998, Walsh supplemented his petition with a claim against several\nstate officials, including the governor, for monetary damages under 42\nU.S.C.A. § 1983 (West Supp. 1999) for wrongful imprisonment. Walsh\ndoes not challenge the district court's dismissal of this claim.\n\n                    7\n\fII.\n\nWalsh argues that the 1977 revisions harmed him for purposes\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause in two ways. 8 First, he claims that the\nrevisions increased the measure of punishment for his crimes by\ntransforming his civil commitment at Patuxent9 into a punitive incar-\nceration. Second, he argues that the revisions cost him his opportu-\nnity, provided by the pre-1977 statute, for an unconditional release\nfrom state custody once he had recovered sufficiently from his status\nas a \"defective delinquent\" for the IBR to recommend his discharge.\n\nThe Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when a statute punishes an\nact that was previously non-criminal, makes the punishment for a\ncrime more severe than when the crime was committed, or deprives\na person charged with a crime of a defense that was previously avail-\nable. See Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 42 (1990). In other\nwords, \"[t]o fall within the ex post facto prohibition, a law must be\nretrospective . . . and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it\nby altering the definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punish-\nment for the crime.\" Lynce v. Mathis, 117 S. Ct. 891, 896 (1997)\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted); accord United States\nv. Lominac, 144 F.3d 308, 311 (4th Cir. 1998). In looking at a change\nto a statute to see if it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, \"we must\ndetermine whether it produces a sufficient risk of increasing the mea-\nsure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\" California Dep't\nof Corrections v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 509 (1995). As the Supreme\nCourt noted in Morales,\n\n           the focus of the ex post facto inquiry is not on whether a leg-\n           islative change produces some ambiguous sort of\"disadvan-\n           tage,\" nor . . . on whether an amendment affects a prisoner's\n           \"opportunity to take advantage of early release,\" but on\n           whether any such change alters the definition of criminal\n_________________________________________________________________\n8 Article I, § 10, of the United States Constitution prohibits the states\nfrom passing any \"ex post facto Law.\"\n9 As Walsh correctly notes, this Court determined, during the first year\nof his commitment to Patuxent, that the Patuxent statute is civil, rather\nthan criminal, in nature. See Tippett v. Maryland, 436 F.2d 1153, 1156-\n57 (4th Cir. 1971).\n\n                    8\n\f          conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punish-\n          able.\n\nId. at 506 n.3 (internal citation omitted). It is clear that a change to\na statute that \"creates only the most speculative and attenuated possi-\nbility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of\npunishment for covered crimes\" will fall short of violating the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. Id. at 509. We review whether a change in law consti-\ntutes a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause under a de novo stan-\ndard. See Plyler v. Moore, 129 F.3d 728, 734 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\nWalsh's first assertion, that the 1977 revisions increased his pun-\nishment by transforming his civil commitment at Patuxent into a puni-\ntive incarceration, is without merit. According to Walsh, the revisions\nharmed him by \"transform[ing] Walsh's civil confinement for the pur-\nposes of rehabilitation and treatment into an immediate, mandatory,\ncriminal punishment of 72 years duration.\" (Appellant's Br. at 19.)\nIn enacting the revisions, the Maryland legislature reimposed his orig-\ninal sentence, \"subject[ing] Walsh to thirteen years of criminal\nimprisonment at Patuxent (1977-1990) [and][ten] more years of\nincarceration at DOC prisons (1990-[2000]).\" (Appellant's Br. at 19.)\nAs Appellees concede, it is clear that the 1977 changes operated retro-\nspectively. The key inquiry, then, is whether the legislature increased\nWalsh's punishment simply by reimposing his criminal sentence. The\nshort answer is no. Before 1977, commitment to Patuxent was inde-\nterminate, and it was certainly feasible for a defendant to serve a lon-\nger term of confinement there than if he served out his sentence in the\nDOC. See Gluckstern v. Sutton, 574 A.2d 898, 901 (Md. 1990). The\n1977 revisions ensured that no inmate, including Walsh, would serve\nan indeterminate, life-long sentence at Patuxent. It is important to reit-\nerate that, before the 1977 revisions reimposed his suspended sen-\ntence, Walsh faced the prospect of remaining an inmate in Patuxent\nfor the rest of his life.10 After the revisions reimposed his suspended\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 We note that, under the pre-1977 statute, a Patuxent inmate's original\nsentence was merely suspended, not erased, and it could be reimposed\nunder several sets of circumstances. For example, an inmate would be\nreturned to the DOC if the IBR petitioned the inmate's sentencing court\nfor a return to the DOC after the inmate had been paroled from Patuxent\n\n                    9\n\fsentence, he no longer faced this prospect. Walsh concedes, as he\nmust, that the time he spent in Patuxent has been credited against his\noriginal seventy-two-year sentence. Once he finishes serving that sen-\ntence, he must be released. We agree with the district court that the\nlegislature's reimposition of the suspended sentence was therefore an\nameliorative change that, if anything, actually decreased the amount\nof time that Walsh will be confined. See Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S.\n282, 294 (1977) (\"It is axiomatic that for a law to be ex post facto it\nmust be more onerous than the prior law.\").11 Not even wildly imagi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nand the sentencing court granted the petition, see Md. Ann. Code art.\n31B § 13(d) (1971); if the IBR recommended his release and the sentenc-\ning court disagreed with that recommendation, see Md. Ann. Code art.\n31B § 13(f) (1971); or if the inmate filed a petition for unconditional\nrelease after serving the equivalent of two-thirds of his original sentence\nand the sentencing court found that he was no longer a \"defective delin-\nquent\" but that he needed to serve out his original sentence in the DOC,\nsee Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 10(a) (1971).\n\n11 Walsh cites a number of cases in which state and federal courts\nstated, either before or during his initial years at Patuxent, that a prison-\ner's detention at Patuxent is civil in nature and not a form of punishment,\nbut of prevention, treatment, and therapy. See , e.g. Tippett v. Maryland,\n436 F.2d 1153, 1156-57 (4th Cir. 1971) (noting that considerations of\npunishment do not dictate an inmate's admittance to Patuxent); Director\nof Patuxent Inst. v. Daniels, 221 A.2d 397, 411 (Md. 1966) (\"The law\non its face clearly shows that it was not enacted to promote the aims of\npunishment, retribution and deterrence, but its only purpose is for the\nprotection of society, and the treatment of the individual to effectuate a\ncure if at all possible.\"). Therefore, he argues, he went from having no\npunishment (serving an indeterminate sentence at Patuxent that was not\nimposed for punitive purposes instead of his original 72-year sentence)\nto having a 72-year sentence. This argument ignores that his original sen-\ntence was never revoked and, as noted in footnote 10, could have been\nreimposed even under the 1977 statute.\n\nWalsh relies primarily upon Kansas v. Hendricks , 117 S. Ct. 2072\n(1997), for the proposition that his civil commitment to Patuxent was not\na form of punishment; therefore, he argues, the reimposition of his crimi-\nnal sentence necessarily increased his punishment. His reliance upon\nHendricks is misplaced because, in that case, the Supreme Court held\nthat the civil commitment proceedings at issue, which followed the end\n\n                     10\n\fnative speculation of the sort rejected by Morales could posit that the\nreplacement of a prisoner's indeterminate, indefinite sentence at\nPatuxent with a determinate sentence somehow increases his punish-\nment.12\n_________________________________________________________________\nof a defendant's criminal sentence, did not violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause because the proceedings were not punitive in nature. See id. at\n2085. The Court was not addressing the situation in which a criminal\nsentence was suspended in favor of an indeterminate civil commitment\nand then reimposed. Indeed, because Walsh's criminal sentence was\nnever erased by his commitment to Patuxent, restoring it and giving\nWalsh credit against it for time served at Patuxent was not an increase\nin punishment irrespective of the nature of Walsh's confinement at\nPatuxent.\n12 As part of his first argument regarding his ex post facto claim, Walsh\ncontends that the reimposition of his sentence immediately following the\n1977 revisions robbed him of his chance to avoid reimposition of that\nsentence and a subsequent transfer to the DOC by having a sentencing\ncourt consider the possibility of unconditional release before reimposing\nhis sentence. To be sure, as Walsh notes, the reimposition of his original\nsentence in July of 1977 did not, as it would have under § 13(f) of the\npre-1977 statute, follow a determination by both the IBR and Walsh's\nsentencing court that he should have gained \"unconditional release from\ncustody as a defective delinquent.\" Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 13(f)\n(1971). However, the 1977 reimposition was still ameliorative because\nit guaranteed that Walsh would only serve his original 72-year sentence,\nagainst which his previous years at Patuxent were credited, instead of\npotentially remaining in Patuxent for the rest of his life. If the old regime\nhad stayed in place and Walsh had never left Patuxent, the only way that\nWalsh, from 1977 until the present, could have had his sentencing court\nconsider the possibility of unconditional release before reimposing his\nsentence was if the IBR recommended that he be granted unconditional\nrelease. No provision of the old statute required that the IBR ever make\nthat recommendation. Thus, instead of robbing Walsh of a chance for his\nsentencing court to consider a recommendation that never had to be\nmade under the old regime, the 1977 revisions ensured that Walsh would\nsee an end to his period of confinement in state custody even if such a\nrecommendation was never made. Moreover, as discussed below, even\nafter the reimposition of his sentence following the 1977 revisions,\nWalsh was still afforded the opportunity to gain early, unconditional\nrelease from that sentence during his time at Patuxent. Unlike the pre-\n\n                  11\n\fWalsh's next argument is that, by reimposing his original sentence,\nthe revisions cost him his opportunity, provided by the pre-1977 stat-\nute, for a sentencing court to consider the option of unconditionally\nreleasing him from state custody once he had recovered sufficiently\nfrom his status as a \"defective delinquent.\" This assertion is without\nmerit, as the post-1977 statute did provide Walsh and other inmates\nwith the opportunity to have their sentences vacated and to gain\nunconditional release from Patuxent once the IBR and the inmate's\nsentencing court agreed that it was safe to release the inmate. As\nnoted above, the IBR made an annual review of every inmate at\nPatuxent under the pre-1977 statute. It then could decide that an\ninmate should remain classified as a \"defective delinquent\" and\nremain at Patuxent; that the inmate be granted parole or a leave of\nabsence; or that the inmate should be granted his unconditional\nrelease from custody as a \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13 (1971). If the IBR chose the last option, it was to inform\nthe inmate's sentencing court of its recommendation. Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13(f). The sentencing court, however, was not bound by\nthis recommendation. On its own, it was to determine\n\n          whether the [inmate] shall be released unconditionally from\n          custody as a defective delinquent, released conditionally on\n          a leave of absence or parole, returned to the custody of the\n          Institution as a defective delinquent, or returned to the\n          Department of Correction, to serve the original sentence\n          upon which he was committed prior to being classified as a\n          defective delinquent.\n\nId.\n\nIt is important to note that, after the 1977 revisions, the IBR contin-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1977 statute, in which transfer to the DOC was an automatic conse-\nquence of the reimposition of the original sentence, see Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13(f), the post-1977 statute allows Patuxent inmates to remain\nin Patuxent once their original sentences have been reimposed and to\ncontinue to have the opportunity for early, unconditional release from\nstate custody. We think that this change is an ameliorative one that actu-\nally improves the position of inmates confined to Patuxent.\n\n                    12\n\fued to make its yearly review of the Patuxent inmates. See Md. Code\nAnn., Correctional Services § 4-302(d) (1999). The IBR retained the\ndiscretion, based upon yearly reviews, to grant a leave of absence or\nparole to a Patuxent inmate. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Ser-\nvices §§ 4-303, 4-305 (1999). To be sure, the revisions eliminated\n§ 13(f) of the pre-1977 statute. However, the post-1977 statute does\nprovide inmates at Patuxent with a similar chance for early, uncondi-\ntional release: The IBR can petition the inmate's sentencing court to\nsuspend or vacate the inmate's remaining sentence after he success-\nfully serves three years on parole without violating the terms of that\nparole. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-305(f). Of\ncourse, this recommendation does not follow a conclusion from the\nBoard that an inmate has recovered from his status as a \"defective\ndelinquent.\" After all, under the 1977 revisions, the inmates at Patux-\nent are termed \"eligible persons\" instead of\"defective delinquents.\"\nThe recommendation does, however, follow the IBR's conclusion\n\"that the individual is safe to be permanently released.\" Id. Because\nWalsh was confined as a \"defective delinquent\" specifically because\nhe was \"an actual danger to society\" who should be treated until it\nwas \"reasonably safe for society to terminate the confinement and\ntreatment,\" Md. Ann. Code art. 31 § 5 (1971), we are unconvinced\nthat Walsh was deprived of the opportunity, during his years at Patux-\nent, to have a sentencing court decide that he should be uncondition-\nally released once he was termed \"cured\" of his mental affliction --\nregardless of the fact that the state stopped calling that affliction \"de-\nfective delinquency.\"13 Of course, once Walsh was transferred from\n_________________________________________________________________\n13 To be sure, a recommendation from the IBR that a Patuxent inmate\nshould be unconditionally released from custody could not occur as fre-\nquently under the post-1977 statute as it could under the pre-1977 statute.\nThe 1977 revisions required an inmate to serve three years on parole\nbefore the IBR could exercise its discretion to make such a recommenda-\ntion. However, because Walsh maintains that he was deprived of all\nopportunities for early, unconditional release during his confinement at\nPatuxent, he obviously does not argue that the decrease in the frequency\nof the opportunities that he did have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nIn any event, such an argument would seem to be foreclosed by existing\nprecedent. See California Dep't of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499,\n509 (1995) (holding that a decrease in the frequency of parole hearings\ndid not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it did not increase the\nmeasure of punishment for the crimes of inmates); Roller v. Gunn, 107\nF.3d 227, 235-36 (4th Cir. 1997) (same).\n\n                  13\n\fPatuxent to the DOC in 1990, the IBR no longer gave him the annual\nreviews from which a recommendation for early, unconditional\nrelease might have come. This fact does not constitute an ex post\nfacto violation because Walsh would not have received those annual\nreviews under the pre-1977 statute once he had been transferred to the\nDOC.\n\nIn sum, we hold that the 1977 revisions to the Patuxent statute\nabout which Walsh complains did not run afoul of the Ex Post Facto\nClause.\n\nIII.\n\nWalsh also contends that, in removing him from Patuxent, the state\nof Maryland deprived him of a state-created liberty interest in remain-\ning at Patuxent and receiving its treatment programs instead of return-\ning to the DOC that is protected by the Due Process Clause.\nAccording to Walsh, the pre-1977 statute entitled him to incarceration\n_________________________________________________________________\nAs noted earlier, under § 10 of the pre-1977 statute, an inmate who\nhad served a period of confinement equal to two-thirds of his original\nsentence could petition his sentencing court for a review of his status as\na \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 10(a) (1971).\nAfter a hearing, the inmate could either be recommitted to Patuxent,\nunconditionally released from custody, or returned to the DOC under his\noriginal sentence with credit for the time that he had spent in Patuxent.\nSee id. To the extent that Walsh argues that the elimination of § 10 by\nthe 1977 revisions constitutes a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nwe disagree. Under the old § 10, Walsh could not have been eligible to\nfile a petition until 2017, a date which will mark the forty-eighth year of\nhis confinement. (Although Walsh's original sentence was imposed in\n1970, his sentence starting running in November of 1969.) This review\nwould have only occurred assuming that Walsh had not been transferred\nout of Patuxent or released before that date. Only pure conjecture of the\nsort rejected by Morales can support the contention that the elimination\nof the old § 10 increased the measure of Walsh's punishment because,\nhad the pre-1977 statute never been revised, Walsh would have still been\nin Patuxent in 2017, and the sentencing court would have determined that\nhe was no longer a \"defective delinquent\" and should be unconditionally\nreleased.\n\n                    14\n\fand treatment at Patuxent until he was pronounced to no longer be a\n\"defective delinquent.\" In 1990, he was declared no longer to be an\n\"eligible person,\" a term that, as noted above, has a slightly different\nmeaning than the term \"defective delinquent.\" Because he has not\nbeen declared to be \"cured\" of his status as a\"defective delinquent,\"\nWalsh argues that removing him from Patuxent deprived him of his\nliberty interest. Because Walsh did not have a state-created liberty\ninterest in remaining at Patuxent and receiving treatment there instead\nof returning to the DOC, this argument fails.\n\nTo the extent that Walsh looks to the language of the 1977 statute\nin an attempt to find a liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent and\nreceiving its treatment programs, he is looking in the wrong place. To\nbe sure, the Supreme Court has \"recognize[d] that States may under\ncertain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by\nthe Due Process Clause.\" Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 483-84\n(1995). In the same opinion, however, the Court rejected the idea that\ncourts should look to the language of prison guidelines in order \"to\ndetermine whether mandatory language and substantive predicates\ncreated an enforceable expectation that the State would produce a par-\nticular outcome with respect to the prisoner's conditions of confine-\nment.\" Id. at 481. Instead, courts are to look to the nature of the\ndeprivation suffered by an inmate and to remember that the liberty\ninterests a state creates\n\n          will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which,\n          while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected\n          manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\n          Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and\n          significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n          incidents of prison life.\n\nId. at 484 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the relevant question in\nregard to whether a state's change of a prisoner's conditions of con-\nfinement deprives that prisoner of a state-created liberty interest is\nwhether the change \"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"14 Id.;\n_________________________________________________________________\n14 In Sandin, the Court specifically rejected the approach of combing\nthrough prison guidelines in search of mandatory language that it had\n\n                    15\n\faccord Beverati v. Smith, 120 F.3d 500, 503 (4th Cir. 1997). In\naddressing this question, our standard of review is de novo. See id. at\n503 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\nIn both Sandin and Beverati, inmates complained that their removal\nfrom the general prison population and placement in disciplinary or\nadministrative segregation deprived them of a state-created liberty\ninterest. See Sandin, 509 U.S. at 476; Beverati, 120 F.3d at 502. In\nrejecting these claims, the Sandin and Beverati Courts compared the\nconditions that the inmates faced in administrative or disciplinary seg-\nregation with those faced by inmates in the general prison population\nand found that the difference in conditions did not present an atypical\nor significant hardship for the inmates. See Sandin, 519 U.S. at 486;\nBeverati, 120 F.3d at 503-04. In Sandin, the Supreme Court noted\nthat, although the disciplinary segregation of Conner, the inmate, was\npunitive, it did \"not present a dramatic departure from the basic con-\nditions of Conner's . . . sentence.\" Sandin , 519 U.S. at 485. Similarly,\nin Beverati, our determination that administrative segregation did not\npresent an atypical or significant hardship involved using the inci-\ndents of prison life that flowed from the inmates' original sentences\nas a baseline for comparison with conditions in administrative segre-\ngation. See Beverati, 120 F.3d at 503.\n\nIn this case, Walsh's original sentence was for a seventy-two-year\nperiod of incarceration in the DOC. Despite his arguments to the con-\n_________________________________________________________________\nearlier adopted in Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983). The Hewitt\napproach, the Court found, had two negative consequences. First, it dis-\ncouraged states from codifying prison guidelines in order to avoid inad-\nvertently creating a liberty interest. See Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482. Second,\nthe Hewitt approach led to the federal courts' involvement in the day-to-\nday management of prisons. See id. Significantly, Walsh all but ignores\nthe Sandin decision, instead relying upon Hewitt in his attempt to comb\nthrough the language of the Patuxent statute in order to advance the\nclaim that he had a state-created liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent\nand receiving its treatment programs. We note that the Maryland case to\nwhich Walsh turns in support of his argument that inmates have a state-\ncreated liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent that is protected by the\nDue Process Clause, Angell v. Henneberry, 607 A.2d 590 (Md. Ct. Spec.\nApp. 1992), was decided before Sandin and thus relied upon the Hewitt\napproach in order to hold that inmates have such an interest. See id. at\n597-98.\n\n                     16\n\ftrary, commitment to Patuxent did not form part of the basic condition\nof his original sentence because the pre-1977 statute certainly did not\nguarantee all convicted defendants admission to Patuxent. Walsh\nmakes the assertion, uncontested by Appellees, that his sentencing\ncourt recommended, as part of his plea agreement, that he be referred\nto the staff of Patuxent for examination. Assuming the truth of this\nassertion, we note that the sentencing court could not promise actual\nadmission to Patuxent. If the Patuxent staff determined that an inmate\nwas not a \"defective delinquent,\" that inmate would be denied admis-\nsion to Patuxent. See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B§ 7(a) (1971). Thus, we\nthink it correct to say that, at the time of Walsh's conviction, the basic\ncondition of his sentence most relevant to our analysis is that he\nwould serve a seventy-two-year sentence in the DOC.\n\nWalsh complains that, in removing him from Patuxent and placing\nhim in the DOC, the state of Maryland deprived him of a state-created\nliberty interest. We find, however, that Maryland simply returned\nWalsh to the basic conditions of his original sentence. Obviously, the\nincidents of prison life that Walsh faced upon his return to the DOC\nin 1990 are the same incidents of prison life that he would have faced\nhad he never been sent to Patuxent, and comparing these identical\nincidents cannot possibly result in our finding that Walsh suffered an\natypical or significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life. See Asquith v. Department of Corrections, 186 F.3d 407,\n412 (3d Cir. 1999) (\"Since an inmate is normally incarcerated in\nprison, Asquith's return to prison [from institutional confinement in\na halfway house] did not impose atypical and significant hardship on\nhim in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life and, therefore,\ndid not deprive him of a protected liberty interest.\"); Griffin v.\nVaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he baseline for deter-\nmining what is `atypical and significant' -- the `ordinary incidents of\nprison life' -- is ascertained by what a sentenced inmate may reason-\nably expect to encounter as a result of his or her conviction in accor-\ndance with due process of law.\"); Callender v. Sioux City Residential\nTreatment Facility, 88 F.3d 666, 669 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding that\nremoving an inmate from a work-release program and returning him\nto prison did not, under Sandin, deprive the inmate of a liberty interest\nbecause prison was \"not atypical of what inmates have to endure in\ndaily prison life.\"). Because we agree with the district court that\n\n                     17\n\fWalsh was deprived of no state-created liberty interest, his due pro-\ncess claim must fail.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court to deny\nWalsh a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                    18\n\f",

See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nJohn Walsh, an inmate currently in the custody of Maryland's\nDivision of Correction (DOC), appeals the order of the district court\ndenying his petition for writ of habeas corpus. He claims that the\n1977 revisions to Maryland's Patuxent statute violated the Ex Post\nFacto Clause in two ways. First, he contends that the revisions\nincreased the measure of punishment for his crimes by transforming\nhis civil commitment at Maryland's Patuxent Institution (Patuxent),\na psychiatric treatment facility for Maryland inmates, into a punitive\nincarceration. Second, he claims that the revisions violated the Ex\nPost Facto Clause by eliminating his opportunity to gain early,\nunconditional release from state custody once he had recovered suffi-\nciently from his status as a \"defective delinquent\" for the staff at\nPatuxent to recommend that he be discharged. Finally, he asserts that\nhis transfer from Patuxent to the general prison population in the\nDOC deprived him of a state-created liberty interest in remaining at\nPatuxent and receiving its treatment programs that is protected by the\nDue Process Clause. Because we find that the revisions actually\ndecreased the potential length of his confinement, and that the revi-\nsions did not eliminate his opportunity to gain early release from state\ncustody during his years in confinement at Patuxent, we agree with\nthe district court that the 1977 revisions do not run afoul of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. Furthermore, because we find that Walsh's\n\n                    2\n\fremoval from Patuxent did not result in Walsh's experiencing a sig-\nnificant and atypical hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life, we agree with the district court that Walsh was not\ndeprived of a state-created liberty interest. Accordingly, we affirm the\ndistrict court's denial of Walsh's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nI.\n\nIn 1970, John Walsh was convicted, upon entering a guilty plea, of\nrape and kidnapping in Maryland state court and sentenced to a\nseventy-two-year term of imprisonment. In 1971, he was committed\nto Patuxent. Under Maryland law in effect before 1977, a prosecutor,\nthe DOC, or a previously sentenced defendant could file a request\nwith the sentencing court asking that the defendant be examined at\nPatuxent, a mental institution, to determine whether he qualified for\nadmission to Patuxent as a \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann.\nCode art. 31B § 6(b) (1971). Upon such a request, or upon its own\ninitiative, the sentencing court could order that a defendant be evalu-\nated by the Patuxent staff. See id.1 Under the former Patuxent statute,2\na \"defective delinquent\" was defined as:\n\n          an individual who, by the demonstration of persistent aggra-\n          vated antisocial or criminal behavior, evidences a propensity\n          toward criminal activity, and who is found to have either\n          such intellectual deficiency or emotional unbalance, or both,\n          as to clearly demonstrate an actual danger to society so as\n          to require such confinement and treatment, when appropri-\n          ate, as may make it reasonably safe for society to terminate\n          the confinement and treatment.\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Appellees do not dispute Walsh's assertion that his sentencing court\nrecommended, as part of a plea agreement, that he be evaluated by the\nPatuxent staff. In any event, the question of who recommended that\nWalsh be evaluated is irrelevant to the issues presented by this appeal.\n2 This opinion refers to those provisions of Maryland law governing the\nadministration of Patuxent as the Patuxent statute. These provisions,\nwhich have obviously changed in content over the years, were formerly\ncodified at Article 31B of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957), but\nare now located in the Correctional Services Article of the Annotated\nCode of Maryland.\n\n                    3\n\fMd. Ann. Code art. 31B § 5 (1971). If the staff concluded that the\ndefendant was a \"defective delinquent,\" the sentencing court con-\nducted a trial on the issue of whether the defendant was a \"defective\ndelinquent.\" If the court found that the defendant was a \"defective delin-\nquent,\"3 the defendant was committed to Patuxent \"for an indetermi-\nnate period without either maximum or minimum limits\" and his\noriginal sentence was suspended. Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 9(b)\n(1971).\n\nWhile at Patuxent, inmates received psychiatric treatment for the\nmental affliction that made them \"defective delinquents.\" Patuxent's\nInstitutional Board of Review (IBR)4 then reviewed the status of the\n\"delinquent\" at least once every calendar year. See Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13(b) (1971). Under the statute, the IBR could grant a leave\nof absence or parole, if it found that parole was for the inmate's bene-\nfit and the benefit of society, or recommend the inmate's uncondi-\ntional release from custody as a \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann.\nCode art. 31B §§ 13(d) and (f) (1971). Upon the IBR's recommenda-\ntion that an inmate be unconditionally released from custody as a \"de-\nfective delinquent,\" the sentencing court not only possessed the\nauthority to order an unconditional release, but it could also order that\nthe inmate be paroled, granted a leave of absence, returned to Patux-\nent, or transferred to the DOC to serve out his original sentence. See\nMd. Ann. Code art. 31B § 13(f) (1971). When the sentencing court\nchose to reimpose the original sentence and transfer a defendant to the\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 A defendant could request a jury trial on the issue of whether he was\na \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 8(c) (1971). In\nthat case, the jury, not the court, would decide the issue. See Md. Ann.\nCode art. 31B, § 9(a) (1971).\n4 The IBR's members included the director of Patuxent, the three asso-\nciate directors, a professor from the University of Maryland School of\nLaw who was a member of the advisory board of Patuxent, either of the\nmembers of the Maryland bar who were members of Patuxent's advisory\nboard, and a sociologist. See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 12 (1971).\nAlthough the positions from which the IBR draws its membership have\nchanged over the years -- for example, the IBR now includes the warden\nof Patuxent and members of the public, but does not include a law pro-\nfessor or a sociologist, see Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-\n205 (1999) -- Walsh does not allege that this change in composition\nresulted in any constitutional violation.\n\n                    4\n\fDOC, the defendant was entitled to credit against that sentence for\ntime spent at Patuxent. See id.\n\nPatuxent inmates were also allowed to petition a state court for\nreview of their status, beginning two years after their initial confine-\nment to the Institution but not before two-thirds of their sentence had\nexpired. See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, § 10(a) (1971). The inmate was\nbrought before a court and permitted to request a jury, which would\ndetermine whether he was still a \"defective delinquent.\" See id. If\nfound to be a \"defective delinquent,\" he was returned to Patuxent;\nhowever, if the jury found that he was no longer a\"defective delin-\nquent,\" the court could release him unconditionally or commit him to\nthe DOC under his original sentence, with credit for time served at\nPatuxent. See id.\n\nIn 1977, the Patuxent statute underwent major revisions in the\nwake of criticism that inmates at Patuxent, who served indeterminate\nsentences and were released only after they were no longer \"defective\ndelinquents,\" often remained in confinement at Patuxent long after\ntheir original sentences had expired. See Gluckstern v. Sutton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2287014\"><a href=\"/opinion/2287014/gluckstern-v-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 901 (Md. 1990). In re-writing the statute, the state legisla-\nture provided that a Patuxent inmate's original sentence was no longer\nsuspended when he entered Patuxent; thus, when he served the length\nof his original sentence, he was entitled to be released. See Md. Code\nAnn., Correctional Services § 4-304(a) (1999). 5 Indeterminate sen-\ntences for inmates at Patuxent were eliminated.\n\nThe legislature made other changes to the statute. Under the re-\nwritten provisions, a person committed to Patuxent was not commit-\nted as a \"defective delinquent,\" but as an\"eligible person.\" An \"eligi-\nble person\" is defined as\n\n           an individual who, (i) has been convicted of a crime and is\n           serving a sentence of imprisonment with at least 3 years\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 All citations to the post-1977 Patuxent statute are to the current\n(1999) Annotated Code of Maryland. Although they have been recently\ntransplanted from former Article 31B to the Correctional Services Arti-\ncle, the contents of the relevant sections have remained substantively\nunchanged since 1977.\n\n                    5\n\f         remaining on the sentence; (ii) has an intellectual impair-\n         ment or emotional imbalance; (iii) is likely to respond favor-\n         ably to the programs and services that the Institution\n         provides; (iv) can better respond to remediation through\n         those programs and services than by other incarceration; and\n         (v) meets the eligibility criteria that the Secretary establishes\n         under § 4-208 of this title.\n\nMd. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-101(e) (1999).6 No longer\ndid sentencing courts determine whether a defendant was a \"defective\ndelinquent\" upon receiving a recommendation from the staff of Patux-\nent. Instead, the Patuxent staff itself assumed complete control over\nwhom to admit as an \"eligible person.\" See Md. Code Ann., Correc-\ntional Services §§ 4-301, 302(b) (1999). The IBR continued to con-\nduct annual reviews of the inmates, see Md. Code Ann., Correctional\nServices § 4-302(d), and it retained the discretion to grant parole\nwhen parole would not impose an unreasonable risk to society and\nwould aid in the remediation of an \"eligible person.\" See Md. Code\nAnn., Correctional Services § 4-305 (1999). As noted above, under\nthe old statute, Maryland courts could choose to release a Patuxent\ninmate unconditionally upon the IBR's recommendation following its\nannual review of the inmate. Under the revised statute, Maryland\ncourts retained their discretion to order an unconditional release upon\nreceiving a recommendation from the IBR. The IBR, however, could\nnot make a recommendation for unconditional release until after the\ninmate had successfully served three years on parole without a viola-\ntion. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-305(f). The revi-\nsions also eliminated the ability of a prisoner at Patuxent to petition\na court to review his status following the expiration of two-thirds of\nhis original sentence. Finally, under the revised statute, the IBR could\ndetermine that an inmate was no longer an \"eligible person\" and then\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 The 1977 revisions did not include part (v) of the definition.

Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-208 (1999), which\nallows the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services to adopt\nregulations to carry out the provisions of Title 4 of the Correctional Ser-\nvices Article. Since 1977, there have also been some minor, non-\nsubstantive, changes to the wording of the definition. Walsh does not\nargue that these subsequent changes somehow enhanced the alleged con-\nstitutional violations caused by the 1977 revisions.\n\n                   6\n\ftransfer a prisoner to the DOC without first petitioning the inmate's\nsentencing court. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services §§ 4-\n306(b)(2) and (b)(3) (1999).\n\nThe revised statute also included a transitional provision to reim-\npose the original sentences of inmates committed before July 1977.\nUnder the revised statute, Walsh's seventy-two-year sentence was\n\"reimposed as of the time it was originally entered, with credit for\ntime spent at the Institution.\" Md. Ann. Code of 1957, art. 31B\n§ 16(b)(1) (1983). After reimposition of his sentence in 1977, Walsh\nremained at Patuxent until September 28, 1990, when the IBR deter-\nmined that he was no longer an \"eligible person.\" Walsh was then\ntransferred to the DOC to serve out the remainder of his seventy-two-\nyear sentence.\n\nIn 1998, Walsh filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland. Among\nother grounds for relief not pertinent here, Walsh asserted that the\n1977 legislative changes to the Patuxent statute violated the Ex Post\nFacto Clause and denied him due process by depriving him of an\nalleged liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent and receiving its\ntreatment programs.7 After the district court denied the petition and\ndenied Walsh's request for a certificate of appealability, we granted\na certificate of appealability on his ex post facto and due process\nclaims.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 In 1995, Walsh filed a habeas petition in which he raised the same\narguments contained in his 1998 petition. The district court dismissed the\npetition without prejudice because Walsh had not raised a challenge to\nthe 1977 revisions in state post-conviction proceedings. When Walsh\nrefiled his petition in 1998, the state conceded that Walsh had exhausted\nhis available state remedies in state post-conviction proceedings, and the\ndistrict court proceeded to the merits of his claims.\n\nIn 1998, Walsh supplemented his petition with a claim against several\nstate officials, including the governor, for monetary damages under 42\nU.S.C.A. § 1983 (West Supp. 1999) for wrongful imprisonment. Walsh\ndoes not challenge the district court's dismissal of this claim.\n\n                    7\n\fII.\n\nWalsh argues that the 1977 revisions harmed him for purposes\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause in two ways. 8 First, he claims that the\nrevisions increased the measure of punishment for his crimes by\ntransforming his civil commitment at Patuxent9 into a punitive incar-\nceration. Second, he argues that the revisions cost him his opportu-\nnity, provided by the pre-1977 statute, for an unconditional release\nfrom state custody once he had recovered sufficiently from his status\nas a \"defective delinquent\" for the IBR to recommend his discharge.\n\nThe Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when a statute punishes an\nact that was previously non-criminal, makes the punishment for a\ncrime more severe than when the crime was committed, or deprives\na person charged with a crime of a defense that was previously avail-\nable.

According to Walsh, the revisions\nharmed him by \"transform[ing] Walsh's civil confinement for the pur-\nposes of rehabilitation and treatment into an immediate, mandatory,\ncriminal punishment of 72 years duration.\" (Appellant's Br. at 19.)\nIn enacting the revisions, the Maryland legislature reimposed his orig-\ninal sentence, \"subject[ing] Walsh to thirteen years of criminal\nimprisonment at Patuxent (1977-1990) [and][ten] more years of\nincarceration at DOC prisons (1990-[2000]).\" (Appellant's Br. at 19.)\nAs Appellees concede, it is clear that the 1977 changes operated retro-\nspectively. The key inquiry, then, is whether the legislature increased\nWalsh's punishment simply by reimposing his criminal sentence. The\nshort answer is no. Before 1977, commitment to Patuxent was inde-\nterminate, and it was certainly feasible for a defendant to serve a lon-\nger term of confinement there than if he served out his sentence in the\nDOC. See Gluckstern v. Sutton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2287014\"><a href=\"/opinion/2287014/gluckstern-v-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 901 (Md. 1990). The\n1977 revisions ensured that no inmate, including Walsh, would serve\nan indeterminate, life-long sentence at Patuxent. It is important to reit-\nerate that, before the 1977 revisions reimposed his suspended sen-\ntence, Walsh faced the prospect of remaining an inmate in Patuxent\nfor the rest of his life.10 After the revisions reimposed his suspended\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 We note that, under the pre-1977 statute, a Patuxent inmate's original\nsentence was merely suspended, not erased, and it could be reimposed\nunder several sets of circumstances. For example, an inmate would be\nreturned to the DOC if the IBR petitioned the inmate's sentencing court\nfor a return to the DOC after the inmate had been paroled from Patuxent\n\n                    9\n\fsentence, he no longer faced this prospect. Walsh concedes, as he\nmust, that the time he spent in Patuxent has been credited against his\noriginal seventy-two-year sentence. Once he finishes serving that sen-\ntence, he must be released. We agree with the district court that the\nlegislature's reimposition of the suspended sentence was therefore an\nameliorative change that, if anything, actually decreased the amount\nof time that Walsh will be confined.

This argument ignores that his original sen-\ntence was never revoked and, as noted in footnote 10, could have been\nreimposed even under the 1977 statute.\n\nWalsh relies primarily upon Kansas v.

His reliance upon\nHendricks is misplaced because, in that case, the Supreme Court held\nthat the civil commitment proceedings at issue, which followed the end\n\n                     10\n\fnative speculation of the sort rejected by Morales could posit that the\nreplacement of a prisoner's indeterminate, indefinite sentence at\nPatuxent with a determinate sentence somehow increases his punish-\nment.12\n_________________________________________________________________\nof a defendant's criminal sentence, did not violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause because the proceedings were not punitive in nature. See id. at\n2085. The Court was not addressing the situation in which a criminal\nsentence was suspended in favor of an indeterminate civil commitment\nand then reimposed. Indeed, because Walsh's criminal sentence was\nnever erased by his commitment to Patuxent, restoring it and giving\nWalsh credit against it for time served at Patuxent was not an increase\nin punishment irrespective of the nature of Walsh's confinement at\nPatuxent.\n12 As part of his first argument regarding his ex post facto claim, Walsh\ncontends that the reimposition of his sentence immediately following the\n1977 revisions robbed him of his chance to avoid reimposition of that\nsentence and a subsequent transfer to the DOC by having a sentencing\ncourt consider the possibility of unconditional release before reimposing\nhis sentence. To be sure, as Walsh notes, the reimposition of his original\nsentence in July of 1977 did not, as it would have under § 13(f) of the\npre-1977 statute, follow a determination by both the IBR and Walsh's\nsentencing court that he should have gained \"unconditional release from\ncustody as a defective delinquent.\" Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 13(f)\n(1971). However, the 1977 reimposition was still ameliorative because\nit guaranteed that Walsh would only serve his original 72-year sentence,\nagainst which his previous years at Patuxent were credited, instead of\npotentially remaining in Patuxent for the rest of his life. If the old regime\nhad stayed in place and Walsh had never left Patuxent, the only way that\nWalsh, from 1977 until the present, could have had his sentencing court\nconsider the possibility of unconditional release before reimposing his\nsentence was if the IBR recommended that he be granted unconditional\nrelease. No provision of the old statute required that the IBR ever make\nthat recommendation. Thus, instead of robbing Walsh of a chance for his\nsentencing court to consider a recommendation that never had to be\nmade under the old regime, the 1977 revisions ensured that Walsh would\nsee an end to his period of confinement in state custody even if such a\nrecommendation was never made. Moreover, as discussed below, even\nafter the reimposition of his sentence following the 1977 revisions,\nWalsh was still afforded the opportunity to gain early, unconditional\nrelease from that sentence during his time at Patuxent. Unlike the pre-\n\n                  11\n\fWalsh's next argument is that, by reimposing his original sentence,\nthe revisions cost him his opportunity, provided by the pre-1977 stat-\nute, for a sentencing court to consider the option of unconditionally\nreleasing him from state custody once he had recovered sufficiently\nfrom his status as a \"defective delinquent.\" This assertion is without\nmerit, as the post-1977 statute did provide Walsh and other inmates\nwith the opportunity to have their sentences vacated and to gain\nunconditional release from Patuxent once the IBR and the inmate's\nsentencing court agreed that it was safe to release the inmate. As\nnoted above, the IBR made an annual review of every inmate at\nPatuxent under the pre-1977 statute. It then could decide that an\ninmate should remain classified as a \"defective delinquent\" and\nremain at Patuxent; that the inmate be granted parole or a leave of\nabsence; or that the inmate should be granted his unconditional\nrelease from custody as a \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13 (1971). If the IBR chose the last option, it was to inform\nthe inmate's sentencing court of its recommendation. Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13(f). The sentencing court, however, was not bound by\nthis recommendation. On its own, it was to determine\n\n          whether the [inmate] shall be released unconditionally from\n          custody as a defective delinquent, released conditionally on\n          a leave of absence or parole, returned to the custody of the\n          Institution as a defective delinquent, or returned to the\n          Department of Correction, to serve the original sentence\n          upon which he was committed prior to being classified as a\n          defective delinquent.\n\nId.\n\nIt is important to note that, after the 1977 revisions, the IBR contin-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1977 statute, in which transfer to the DOC was an automatic conse-\nquence of the reimposition of the original sentence, see Md. Ann. Code\nart. 31B § 13(f), the post-1977 statute allows Patuxent inmates to remain\nin Patuxent once their original sentences have been reimposed and to\ncontinue to have the opportunity for early, unconditional release from\nstate custody. We think that this change is an ameliorative one that actu-\nally improves the position of inmates confined to Patuxent.\n\n                    12\n\fued to make its yearly review of the Patuxent inmates. See Md. Code\nAnn., Correctional Services § 4-302(d) (1999). The IBR retained the\ndiscretion, based upon yearly reviews, to grant a leave of absence or\nparole to a Patuxent inmate. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Ser-\nvices §§ 4-303, 4-305 (1999). To be sure, the revisions eliminated\n§ 13(f) of the pre-1977 statute. However, the post-1977 statute does\nprovide inmates at Patuxent with a similar chance for early, uncondi-\ntional release: The IBR can petition the inmate's sentencing court to\nsuspend or vacate the inmate's remaining sentence after he success-\nfully serves three years on parole without violating the terms of that\nparole. See Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services § 4-305(f). Of\ncourse, this recommendation does not follow a conclusion from the\nBoard that an inmate has recovered from his status as a \"defective\ndelinquent.\" After all, under the 1977 revisions, the inmates at Patux-\nent are termed \"eligible persons\" instead of\"defective delinquents.\"\nThe recommendation does, however, follow the IBR's conclusion\n\"that the individual is safe to be permanently released.\" Id. Because\nWalsh was confined as a \"defective delinquent\" specifically because\nhe was \"an actual danger to society\" who should be treated until it\nwas \"reasonably safe for society to terminate the confinement and\ntreatment,\" Md. Ann. Code art. 31 § 5 (1971), we are unconvinced\nthat Walsh was deprived of the opportunity, during his years at Patux-\nent, to have a sentencing court decide that he should be uncondition-\nally released once he was termed \"cured\" of his mental affliction --\nregardless of the fact that the state stopped calling that affliction \"de-\nfective delinquency.\"13 Of course, once Walsh was transferred from\n_________________________________________________________________\n13 To be sure, a recommendation from the IBR that a Patuxent inmate\nshould be unconditionally released from custody could not occur as fre-\nquently under the post-1977 statute as it could under the pre-1977 statute.\nThe 1977 revisions required an inmate to serve three years on parole\nbefore the IBR could exercise its discretion to make such a recommenda-\ntion. However, because Walsh maintains that he was deprived of all\nopportunities for early, unconditional release during his confinement at\nPatuxent, he obviously does not argue that the decrease in the frequency\nof the opportunities that he did have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nIn any event, such an argument would seem to be foreclosed by existing\nprecedent.

This fact does not constitute an ex post\nfacto violation because Walsh would not have received those annual\nreviews under the pre-1977 statute once he had been transferred to the\nDOC.\n\nIn sum, we hold that the 1977 revisions to the Patuxent statute\nabout which Walsh complains did not run afoul of the Ex Post Facto\nClause.\n\nIII.\n\nWalsh also contends that, in removing him from Patuxent, the state\nof Maryland deprived him of a state-created liberty interest in remain-\ning at Patuxent and receiving its treatment programs instead of return-\ning to the DOC that is protected by the Due Process Clause.\nAccording to Walsh, the pre-1977 statute entitled him to incarceration\n_________________________________________________________________\nAs noted earlier, under § 10 of the pre-1977 statute, an inmate who\nhad served a period of confinement equal to two-thirds of his original\nsentence could petition his sentencing court for a review of his status as\na \"defective delinquent.\" See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B § 10(a) (1971).\nAfter a hearing, the inmate could either be recommitted to Patuxent,\nunconditionally released from custody, or returned to the DOC under his\noriginal sentence with credit for the time that he had spent in Patuxent.\nSee id. To the extent that Walsh argues that the elimination of § 10 by\nthe 1977 revisions constitutes a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nwe disagree. Under the old § 10, Walsh could not have been eligible to\nfile a petition until 2017, a date which will mark the forty-eighth year of\nhis confinement. (Although Walsh's original sentence was imposed in\n1970, his sentence starting running in November of 1969.) This review\nwould have only occurred assuming that Walsh had not been transferred\nout of Patuxent or released before that date. Only pure conjecture of the\nsort rejected by Morales can support the contention that the elimination\nof the old § 10 increased the measure of Walsh's punishment because,\nhad the pre-1977 statute never been revised, Walsh would have still been\nin Patuxent in 2017, and the sentencing court would have determined that\nhe was no longer a \"defective delinquent\" and should be unconditionally\nreleased.\n\n                    14\n\fand treatment at Patuxent until he was pronounced to no longer be a\n\"defective delinquent.\" In 1990, he was declared no longer to be an\n\"eligible person,\" a term that, as noted above, has a slightly different\nmeaning than the term \"defective delinquent.\" Because he has not\nbeen declared to be \"cured\" of his status as a\"defective delinquent,\"\nWalsh argues that removing him from Patuxent deprived him of his\nliberty interest. Because Walsh did not have a state-created liberty\ninterest in remaining at Patuxent and receiving treatment there instead\nof returning to the DOC, this argument fails.\n\nTo the extent that Walsh looks to the language of the 1977 statute\nin an attempt to find a liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent and\nreceiving its treatment programs, he is looking in the wrong place.

In the same opinion, however, the Court rejected the idea that\ncourts should look to the language of prison guidelines in order \"to\ndetermine whether mandatory language and substantive predicates\ncreated an enforceable expectation that the State would produce a par-\nticular outcome with respect to the prisoner's conditions of confine-\nment.\" Id. at 481. Instead, courts are to look to the nature of the\ndeprivation suffered by an inmate and to remember that the liberty\ninterests a state creates\n\n          will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which,\n          while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected\n          manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\n          Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and\n          significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n          incidents of prison life.\n\nId. at 484 (internal citations omitted).

In\nrejecting these claims, the Sandin and Beverati Courts compared the\nconditions that the inmates faced in administrative or disciplinary seg-\nregation with those faced by inmates in the general prison population\nand found that the difference in conditions did not present an atypical\nor significant hardship for the inmates. See Sandin, 519 U.S. at 486;\nBeverati, 120 F.3d at 503-04. In Sandin, the Supreme Court noted\nthat, although the disciplinary segregation of Conner, the inmate, was\npunitive, it did \"not present a dramatic departure from the basic con-\nditions of Conner's . . . sentence.\" Sandin , 519 U.S. at 485. Similarly,\nin Beverati, our determination that administrative segregation did not\npresent an atypical or significant hardship involved using the inci-\ndents of prison life that flowed from the inmates' original sentences\nas a baseline for comparison with conditions in administrative segre-\ngation. See Beverati, 120 F.3d at 503.\n\nIn this case, Walsh's original sentence was for a seventy-two-year\nperiod of incarceration in the DOC. Despite his arguments to the con-\n_________________________________________________________________\nearlier adopted in Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983). The Hewitt\napproach, the Court found, had two negative consequences. First, it dis-\ncouraged states from codifying prison guidelines in order to avoid inad-\nvertently creating a liberty interest. See Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482. Second,\nthe Hewitt approach led to the federal courts' involvement in the day-to-\nday management of prisons. See id. Significantly, Walsh all but ignores\nthe Sandin decision, instead relying upon Hewitt in his attempt to comb\nthrough the language of the Patuxent statute in order to advance the\nclaim that he had a state-created liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent\nand receiving its treatment programs. We note that the Maryland case to\nwhich Walsh turns in support of his argument that inmates have a state-\ncreated liberty interest in remaining at Patuxent that is protected by the\nDue Process Clause, Angell v. Henneberry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985410\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985410/angell-v-henneberry/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Md. Ct. Spec.\nApp. 1992), was decided before Sandin and thus relied upon the Hewitt\napproach in order to hold that inmates have such an interest. See id. at\n597-98.\n\n                     16\n\ftrary, commitment to Patuxent did not form part of the basic condition\nof his original sentence because the pre-1977 statute certainly did not\nguarantee all convicted defendants admission to Patuxent. Walsh\nmakes the assertion, uncontested by Appellees, that his sentencing\ncourt recommended, as part of his plea agreement, that he be referred\nto the staff of Patuxent for examination. Assuming the truth of this\nassertion, we note that the sentencing court could not promise actual\nadmission to Patuxent. If the Patuxent staff determined that an inmate\nwas not a \"defective delinquent,\" that inmate would be denied admis-\nsion to Patuxent. See Md. Ann. Code art. 31B§ 7(a) (1971). Thus, we\nthink it correct to say that, at the time of Walsh's conviction, the basic\ncondition of his sentence most relevant to our analysis is that he\nwould serve a seventy-two-year sentence in the DOC.\n\nWalsh complains that, in removing him from Patuxent and placing\nhim in the DOC, the state of Maryland deprived him of a state-created\nliberty interest. We find, however, that Maryland simply returned\nWalsh to the basic conditions of his original sentence. Obviously, the\nincidents of prison life that Walsh faced upon his return to the DOC\nin 1990 are the same incidents of prison life that he would have faced\nhad he never been sent to Patuxent, and comparing these identical\nincidents cannot possibly result in our finding that Walsh suffered an\natypical or significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life. See Asquith v. Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765509\"><a href=\"/opinion/765509/william-eugene-asquith-v-department-of-corrections-volunteers-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n412 (3d Cir. 1999) (\"Since an inmate is normally incarcerated in\nprison, Asquith's return to prison [from institutional confinement in\na halfway house] did not impose atypical and significant hardship on\nhim in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life and, therefore,\ndid not deprive him of a protected liberty interest.\"); Griffin v.\nVaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740238\"><a href=\"/opinion/740238/jerome-griffin-v-don-vaughn-hugh-owens-bk-smith-r-johnson-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he baseline for deter-\nmining what is `atypical and significant' -- the `ordinary incidents of\nprison life' -- is ascertained by what a sentenced inmate may reason-\nably expect to encounter as a result of his or her conviction in accor-\ndance with due process of law.\"); Callender v.
