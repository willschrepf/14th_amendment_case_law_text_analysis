She also alleges several state-law claims. Latham & Watkins moves to\n\ndismiss on various grounds, including lack of subject matter jurisdiction, untimeliness, and\n\nfailure to state a claim. The motion will be granted in part for the reasons explained below.\n\n                                             I. FACTS\n\n                  According to the Amended Complaint, Latham & Watkins LLP (Latham) hired\n\nDemetria Peart, an African American woman, as a legal secretary in April 2007. Six months\n\nlater, Ms. Peart learned that she was pregnant and notified her secretarial supervisor. She\n\ncontinued to work until serious medical complications relating to her pregnancy forced her in\n\nNovember 2007 to go on doctor-mandated bed rest. Ms. Peart subsequently sought, and\n\nreceived, short-term disability payments. Am. Compl. [Dkt. 11] ¶¶ 1, 3, 4, 9; Mot. to Dismiss\n\n[Dkt. 14] at 3.\n\n                  Ms. Peart asserts that Latham terminated her on January 24, 2008. She claims\n\nthat Christopher Carr, Latham’s human resources manager, informed her on January 24 via a\n\n\n                                                  1\n\ftelephone call that she was fired from the firm because “she was no longer needed,” adding that\n\n“her pregnancy complications were not his problem.” Am. Compl. ¶ 10. Ms. Peart later learned\n\nthat Mr. Carr had told other Latham personnel that she had been terminated because of “damn\n\nthirteen weeks [of] morning sickness” and that her pregnancy was “not [their] concern.” Id.\n\n¶ 11.\n\n               In early 2008, Ms. Peart filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (EEOC) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e–\n\n2000e-17, alleging discrimination based on gender and pregnancy. Pursuant to a “work-sharing\n\nagreement” between EEOC and the D.C. Office of Human Rights (OHR), Ms. Peart’s case was\n\n“transferred” to OHR on July 14, 2008. Def.’s Mot. Judicial Notice [Dkt. 15], Ex. 1 (Mar. 18,\n\n2011 OHR Letter) [Dkt. 15-2] at 1 n.1. OHR then issued a finding on March 18, 2011, that there\n\nwas “NO PROBABLE CAUSE [sic] to believe that [Latham] subjected [Ms. Peart] to disparate\n\ntreatment based on sex (female/pregnant) when she was allegedly terminated from her position\n\nas Legal Secretary while out of work on doctor-mandated bed rest.” Id. at 9. Ms. Peart\n\nsubsequently asked OHR to reconsider its decision. After Latham failed to oppose Ms. Peart’s\n\nreconsideration request, OHR issued a decision on September 6, 2011, reversing its initial “no\n\nprobable cause” determination and ordering a hearing before the D.C. Human Rights\n\nCommission. Id., Ex. 2 (Sept. 6, 2011 OHR Letter) [Dkt. 15-3] at 3. This decision, however,\n\nwas deemed void following the revelation that Latham had not received notice of the\n\nreconsideration due to “clerical errors.” Id., Ex. 3 (Mar. 29, 2012 OHR Letter) [Dkt. 15-4] at 2.\n\nOHR reviewed Latham’s opposition to Ms. Peart’s reconsideration request and issued a new\n\ndecision on March 29, 2012. It found that because Ms. Peart was delinquent in responding to\n\nLatham’s requests for information regarding her ability to return to work, there was “no evidence\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fdemonstrating that [Latham’s] actions were pretext for discrimination.” Id. at 6. OHR affirmed\n\nits “no probable cause” finding, and informed Ms. Peart that the March 29 letter was a final\n\ndecision from which she had three years to seek judicial review in D.C. Superior Court. Id. at 6-\n\n7.\n\n               For reasons unexplained in the record, more than five years after her termination,\n\nEEOC finally issued a “Right to Sue” letter to Ms. Peart on April 18, 2013. See id., Ex. 4 (Apr.\n\n18, 2013 EEOC Right to Sue Letter) [Dkt. 15-5]. Ms. Peart filed her original Complaint in this\n\nmatter four days later. See Compl. [Dkt. 1]. Latham moved to dismiss the Complaint, see Mot.\n\nto Dismiss [Dkt. 8], and Ms. Peart filed an Amended Complaint on June 1, 2013. See Am.\n\nCompl.\n\n               The Amended Complaint contains five counts: violation of Title VII, as amended\n\nby the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k), (Count I); violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981 (Count II); breach of an implied contract and wrongful discharge (Count III); intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress (Count IV); and violation of the D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n(DCHRA), D.C. Code §§ 2-1401.01 et seq. (Count V). On June 20, 2013, Latham again moved\n\nto dismiss and requested judicial notice of certain documentation. See Mot to Dismiss; Def.’s\n\nMot. Judicial Notice. Ms. Peart opposes the motion to dismiss, is silent as to Latham’s request\n\nfor judicial notice, and asks the Court to take judicial notice of an affidavit from a former Latham\n\nemployee. See Opp’n [Dkt. 16].\n\n                                   II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n               Latham’s Motion to Dismiss requires the Court to resolve three issues. One is\n\njurisdictional. Counts I and II are federal law claims and Counts III, IV, and V are state law\n\nclaims. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether it should exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the state causes of action. The other two issues concern the propriety of\n                                                 3\n\fdismissing a complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\nSpecifically, Latham has moved to dismiss the claims alleged in the Amended Complaint for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and untimeliness.\n\n       A. Jurisdiction\n\n               Federal district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under\n\nfederal statutes. 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In certain circumstances, § 1331 may also provide a federal\n\ncourt with an independent basis for exercising jurisdiction over related state-law claims. Women\n\nPrisoners of the D.C. Dep’t of Corr. v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910, 920 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nTo determine when the assertion of supplemental jurisdiction is appropriate, the district court\n\napplies a two-part test. Id. (citing United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966)).\n\n               First, the district court must determine whether the state and the\n               federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact; if\n               they do, the court has the power, under Article III of the\n               Constitution, to hear the state claim. Second, even if it concludes\n               that it has that power, the district court must then decide whether to\n               exercise its discretion to assert jurisdiction over the state issue.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotations omitted). In deciding whether to assert supplemental\n\njurisdiction over a state-law claim, the court should consider whether judicial economy,\n\nconvenience and fairness to litigants weigh in favor of doing so. A court may decline to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction, however, if the state claim raises a novel or complex issue of state\n\nlaw, substantially predominates over the federal claims, or remains after the court has dismissed\n\nthe federal claims. Id. at 921 (citing the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1367). If\n\na federal court invokes its supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, then it “is bound to\n\napply the law of the forum state to the same extent as if it were exercising its diversity\n\njurisdiction.” Super Sulky, Inc. v. U.S. Trotting Ass’n, 174 F.3d 733, 741 (6th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f       B. Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n               Latham moves to dismiss Count V under FRCP 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction. When considering such a motion, a court reviews the complaint liberally,\n\ngranting the plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged. Barr\n\nv. Clinton, 370 F.3d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Nonetheless, “the Court need not accept\n\nfactual inferences drawn by plaintiffs if those inferences are not supported by facts alleged in the\n\ncomplaint, nor must the Court accept plaintiffs’ legal conclusions.” Speelman v. United States,\n\n461 F. Supp. 2d 71, 73 (D.D.C. 2006). No action of the parties can confer subject matter\n\njurisdiction on a federal court because subject matter jurisdiction is an Article III and a statutory\n\nrequirement. Akinseye v. District of Columbia, 339 F.3d 970, 971 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The party\n\nclaiming subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating that such jurisdiction\n\nexists. Khadr v. United States, 529 F.3d 1112, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see Kokkonen v. Guardian\n\nLife Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (noting that federal courts are courts of limited\n\njurisdiction and “[i]t is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and the\n\nburden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.” (internal citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n       C. Failure to State a Claim\n\n               Latham’s motion to dismiss Counts I, II, III, and IV under FRCP 12(b)(6)\n\nchallenges the adequacy of the Amended Complaint allegations on their face. Such a motion\n\ntests whether a plaintiff has properly stated a claim. FRCP 8(a), on which Latham relies,\n\nrequires that a complaint contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A complaint must be sufficient “to give\n\nthe defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atl.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n\nAlthough a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to\n\nprovide the grounds of his entitlement to relief “requires more than labels and conclusions, and a\n\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. The facts alleged\n\n“must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . .” Id. Rule 8(a) thus\n\nrequires an actual showing and not just a blanket assertion of a right to relief. Id. at 555 n.3.\n\n               To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,\n\naccepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is “plausible on its face.” Id. at 570. When the\n\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows a court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged, then the claim has facial plausibility. Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability\n\nrequirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”\n\nId. A court must treat the complaint’s factual allegations as true, “even if doubtful in fact.”\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555. But a court need not accept as true legal conclusions set forth in a\n\ncomplaint. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,\n\nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”).\n\n               FRCP 12(b)(6) also is the vehicle for asserting the affirmative defense of statutory\n\ntime limitation. As this Circuit has held, “an affirmative defense may be raised by pre-answer\n\nmotion under Rule 12(b) when the facts that give rise to the defense are clear from the face of the\n\ncomplaint.” Smith-Haynie v. District of Columbia, 155 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Before\n\ngranting such a motion, however, the district court must ensure that the face of the complaint\n\nconclusively shows the claim is time-barred. Performance Contracting, Inc. v. Rapid Response\n\nConstr., Inc., 267 F.R.D. 422, 425 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Smith-Haynie, 155 F.3d at 578). This is\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f“because statute of limitations issues often depend on contested questions of fact.” Firestone v.\n\nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C. Cir. 1996). As a result, dismissal of a claim on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds should be reserved for cases in which “‘no reasonable person could disagree\n\non the date’ on which the cause of action accrued.” Lewis v. Bayh, 577 F. Supp. 2d 47, 51\n\n(D.D.C. 2008) (quoting Smith v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 3 F. Supp. 2d 1473, 1475\n\n(D.D.C. 1998)); see also Turner v. Afro-Am. Newspaper Co., 572 F. Supp. 2d 71, 72 (D.D.C.\n\n2008) (“A court should grant a pre-discovery motion to dismiss on limitations grounds ‘only if\n\nthe complaint on its face is conclusively time-barred,’ and the parties do not dispute when the\n\nlimitations period began.” (quoting DePippo v. Chertoff, 456 F. Supp. 2d 30, 33 (D.D.C. 2006)).\n\n                                         III. ANALYSIS\n\n               Before delving into Latham’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court will address two\n\npreliminary issues. First, the Court will analyze the bases for its exercise of original and\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the federal-law and state-law claims. Second, the Court will\n\naddress the parties’ respective requests for judicial notice. Finding jurisdiction exists over the\n\nfederal and state claims, the Court then will consider whether any of the counts alleged in the\n\nAmended Complaint survive Latham’s dismissal motion.\n\n       A. Original and Supplemental Jurisdiction\n\n               The basis for this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over Ms. Peart’s federal-law\n\nclaims is clear. Counts I and II allege violations of two federal statutes: Title VII and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981. These claims thus present questions of federal law. The Court accordingly has original\n\njurisdiction with respect to Counts I and II. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n               Counts III, IV, and V, on the other hand, are state-law claims. They nonetheless\n\nstem from the same events as the federal-law claims: Ms. Peart’s pregnancy, leave from work,\n\nand subsequent termination. The Court therefore concludes that Ms. Peart’s federal and state\n                                                  7\n\fcounts arise from one “common nucleus of operative fact.” As such, her state-law claims are\n\npart of the same “case or controversy” under Article III. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). Because the facts\n\nunderlying Ms. Peart’s federal-law and state-law claims substantially overlap, the Court\n\nconcludes that judicial economy, comity, convenience, and fairness weigh in favor of hearing\n\nboth sets of claims in the same proceeding. Finally, the Court holds that Ms. Peart’s claims of\n\nbreach of an implied contract, wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress,\n\nand violation of DCHRA are not novel or complex issues of state law that lie beyond the ken of\n\nthis Court. Id. § 1367(c). The Court thus elects to retain its supplemental jurisdiction over Ms.\n\nPeart’s state-law claims. It will apply the law of the District of Columbia to these counts.\n\n       B. Requests for Judicial Notice\n\n                Turning to the Latham’s and Ms. Peart’s requests for judicial notice, the Court\n\nwill grant the former and deny the latter. Latham asks the Court to take judicial notice of four\n\ndocuments: OHR’s letters dated March 18, 2011, September 6, 2011, and March 29, 2012,\n\nregarding Ms. Peart’s discrimination claims; and EEOC’s Right to Sue letter dated April 18,\n\n2013. See Def.’s Mot. Judicial Notice, Exs. 1-4. Mrs. Peart does not oppose this request. She\n\ninstead asks the Court to take judicial notice of the affidavit of Marquita Chambers, a legal\n\nsecretary at Latham from June to October 2007, which provides Ms. Chambers’s impression of\n\nMs. Peart’s work ethic, pregnancy complications, and termination. See Opp’n, Ex. 6 (Chambers\n\nAff.) [16-1].\n\n                In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), a court\n\nmay take judicial notice of public records from other proceedings, Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v.\n\nChao, 508 F.3d 1052, 1059 (D.C. Cir. 2007); Settles v. U.S. Parole Commission, 429 F.3d 1098,\n\n1107 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Covad Communications Co. v. Bell Atlantic Corp., 407 F.3d 1220, 1222\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f(D.C. Cir. 2005); see also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007),\n\nso long as the matters to be noticed are relevant, Whiting v. AARP, 637 F.3d 355, 364 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011). Here, the Court finds it appropriate to take judicial notice of the facts contained in the\n\nOHR and EEOC letters as they “can be accurately and readily determined” from a public agency\n\nproceeding, the accuracy of which “cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2).\n\nThe Court conversely deems it inappropriate to take judicial notice of Ms. Chamber’s affidavit.\n\nThe accuracy of Ms. Chambers’s affidavit, which is riddled with hearsay, cannot be readily\n\ndetermined and is subject to questioning since it reflects an individual’s personal opinions.\n\nMoreover, the topics on which Ms. Chambers opines are superfluous to the issues pertinent to\n\nthe instant motion to dismiss. Latham contends that Ms. Peart’s Amended Complaint must be\n\ndismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction and a lapse of the applicable statutes of\n\nlimitations. Whether Ms. Chambers perceived Ms. Peart to be dedicated to her job, understood\n\nMs. Peart’s pregnancy to have been difficult, or thought Ms. Peart’s termination was\n\n“shock[ing],” Chambers Aff. ¶¶ 4-6, is irrelevant to the proceeding at this juncture.\n\n       C. Federal-Law Claims\n\n               The federal-law claims asserted in the Amended Complaint are limited to two\n\ncounts. Count I asserts a violation of Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination\n\nAct, and Count II asserts a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. For the reasons below, the Court will\n\ndismiss in part Count I without prejudice and dismiss Count II with prejudice.\n\n               1. Count I: Title VII Claim\n\n               As for Count I, Ms. Peart’s Title VII allegations, the Court will partially grant\n\nLatham’s Motion to Dismiss. Count I reads in relevant part:\n\n               Defendant, by and through its employees, conspired to deny\n               Plaintiff Peart of her employment rights, as guaranteed by the\n\n                                                 9\n\f               [Pregnancy Discrimination Act] and Title VII, by creating a hostile\n               work environment, treating her disparately and discriminating\n               against her in her employment on the basis of her pregnancy and\n               gender.    Plaintiff Peart was subjected to said employment\n               conditions based solely on her pregnancy discrimination [sic] and\n               gender––and was subjected to said conditions when those in non-\n               protected categories were treated differently and favorably in their\n               employment.\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 16. Latham’s dismissal motion addresses Count I inasmuch as Ms. Peart asserts a\n\nviolation of Title VII based on a hostile work environment. Latham contends that the hostile\n\nwork environment allegation must be dismissed for failure to establish a sufficient basis for\n\nrelief. The Court agrees.\n\n               Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978. That Act amended\n\nTitle VII to prohibit an employer from discriminating “on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or\n\nrelated medical conditions,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k), in hiring or firing; compensation; terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment; or otherwise limiting, segregating, or classifying\n\nemployees in a way that would adversely affect their status as employees, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(a). The Supreme Court has determined that the “terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment” language “evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of\n\ndisparate treatment of men and women in employment, which includes requiring people to work\n\nin a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17,\n\n21 (1993) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Therefore, Title VII is violated when a\n\nplaintiff demonstrates that the “workplace is permeated with ‘discriminatory intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult,’” id. at 21 (quoting Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65\n\n(1986)), and the behavior is “‘sufficiently severe or pervasive [as] to alter the conditions of the\n\nvictim’s employment and create an abusive working environment,’” id. (quoting Meritor, 477\n\nU.S. at 67). To establish a prima facie hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must\n\n                                                 10\n\fdemonstrate that (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) she was subject to unwelcome\n\nharassment, (3) the harassment occurred because of her membership in the protected class,\n\n(4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment, and (5) the employer\n\nknew or should have known of the harassment, and failed to act to prevent it. Lester v. Natsios,\n\n290 F. Supp. 2d 11, 22 (D.D.C. 2003) (citing Jones v. Billington, 12 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C.\n\n1997)).\n\n               In determining whether a claim of a hostile work environment claim is\n\nsubstantiated, a court looks at all the circumstances of the plaintiff’s employment, focusing on\n\nsuch factors as the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was\n\nphysically threatening or humiliating or was merely offensive; and whether it unreasonably\n\ninterfered with the employee’s work performance. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23. The conduct must be\n\nsufficiently extreme to constitute a change in the conditions of employment, so that Title VII\n\ndoes not devolve into a “‘general civility code.’” Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775,\n\n788 (1998) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998)).\n\nConsequently, “‘mere utterance of an epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an\n\nemployee’ does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII.”\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 21 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67). Further, “‘simple teasing,’ offhand\n\ncomments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory\n\nchanges in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 778 (quoting\n\nOncale, 523 U.S. at 82).\n\n               For example, in George v. Leavitt, 407 F.3d 405 (D.C. Cir. 2005), the D.C.\n\nCircuit affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that telling the plaintiff to\n\n“go back [to] where she came from” on three occasions over a two-month period, separate acts\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fof yelling and hostility, and allegations that the plaintiff was not given the type of work she\n\ndeserved, were isolated incidents that did not rise to the level of severity necessary to find a\n\nhostile work environment, id. at 408, 416-17. Similarly, in Singh v. U.S. House of\n\nRepresentatives, 300 F. Supp. 2d 48 (D.D.C. 2004), this Court entered summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendant because the plaintiff’s allegations that her employer humiliated her at\n\nimportant meetings, screamed at her in one instance, told her to “shut up and sit down” in\n\nanother instance, and was “constantly hostile and hypercritical” did not amount to a hostile work\n\nenvironment, even though these actions may have been disrespectful and unfair, id. at 54-57.\n\n               A hostile work environment claim need not rest solely on incidents that occurred\n\nwhile the plaintiff was physically at the workplace. Greer v. Paulson, 505 F.3d 1306, 1314\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (joining five other circuits in “rejecting a per se rule against considering\n\nincidents alleged to have occurred while an employee was physically absent from the\n\nworkplace”). Nonetheless, a plaintiff must demonstrate that her employer’s alleged acts were\n\nwork-related and collectively gave rise to a hostile environment. “Discrete acts constituting\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation claims, therefore, are different in kind from a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim that must be based on severe or pervasive discriminatory intimidation or\n\ninsult.” Lester, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 33 (citing Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S.\n\n101, 115-16 (2002)). Simply stated, “[w]orkplace conduct is not measured in isolation . . . .”\n\nClark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270 (2001) (per curiam).\n\n               Although a plaintiff is “not required to plead a prima facie case of hostile work\n\nenvironment in the complaint, the alleged facts must be able to support such a claim.” Moore v.\n\nAshcroft, 401 F. Supp. 2d 1, 42 (D.D.C. 2005) (citing Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216\n\nF.3d 1111, 1114 (D.C. Cir. 2000)). Ms. Peart’s harassment claim fails this metric. Her hostile\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fworkplace claim is comprised of two incidents. She alleges that Christopher Carr, Latham’s\n\nmanager of human resources, informed her by phone that she was fired from the firm because\n\n“she was no longer needed,” and added that “her pregnancy complications were not his\n\nproblem.” Am. Compl. ¶ 10. Ms. Peart also claims that Mr. Carr told other Latham personnel\n\nthat she was terminated because of her “damn thirteen weeks [of] morning sickness” and that her\n\npregnancy was “not [the firm’s] concern.” Id. ¶ 11. Presuming these allegations to be true, as\n\nthe Court must at this stage in the proceedings, they are insufficiently pervasive or severe to\n\nconstitute a hostile work environment, as pled in the Amended Complaint. They were isolated,\n\noccurring only twice. Moreover, they were not sufficiently extreme so as to support a finding\n\nthat the comments would have interfered with Ms. Peart’s ability to return to work or\n\nunreasonably affected her work performance once she returned. Accordingly, the Court will\n\ndismiss without prejudice Ms. Peart’s hostile work environment claim under Title VII.\n\n               The Court will not dismiss Count I outright, however. Although obscured by\n\nmaladroit pleading, Count I appears to be broader than just a hostile work environment claim\n\nunder Title VII. A fair reading of Count I demonstrates that Ms. Peart also has pled gender and\n\npregnancy discrimination and disparate treatment. Neither party, however, acknowledges this\n\npoint. Latham construes Count I as “limited to a single claim” of hostile work environment,\n\nMot. to Dismiss at 16, and Ms. Peart’s counsel does not correct this reading. Nonetheless, the\n\nCourt finds that, under the precepts of Twombly and Iqbal, Ms. Peart has stated sufficient facts to\n\nmake out at least a discrimination claim. The Complaint provides Latham with fair notice.\n\nFurther, the facts alleged raise Ms. Peart’s right to relief above a speculative level, Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 555, such that Count I has facial plausibility, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Count I therefore\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fsurvives Latham’s Motion to Dismiss inasmuch as it asserts discrimination and disparate\n\ntreatment in violation of Title VII.\n\n               2. Count II: 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\n               With respect to Count II, Ms. Peart accuses Latham of violating 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\n“by creating a hostile work environment and discriminating against [her] both on the basis of her\n\npregnancy and gender.” Am. Compl. ¶ 18. Latham contends that Count II must be dismissed for\n\nfailure to state a claim because § 1981 is inapplicable to the discrimination claims that Ms.\n\nPeart’s alleges. The Court agrees.\n\n               Section 1981 does not provide a cause of action for pregnancy or gender\n\ndiscrimination. The statute reads, in relevant part:\n\n               All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have\n               the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce\n               contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and\n               equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\n               persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n               subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and\n               exactions of every kind, and to no other.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) (emphasis added). As is clear from the statute’s language, § 1981 is limited\n\nto racial discrimination. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 167 (1976) (stating that 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981 only prohibits racial discrimination and not sex or religious discrimination); Bello\n\nv. Howard Univ., 898 F. Supp. 2d 213, 219 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that “42 U.S.C. § 1981 is\n\nnarrowly addressed to racial discrimination and is ‘in no way’ directed to sex or gender\n\ndiscrimination.” (quoting Runyon, 427 U.S. at 167)).\n\n               Ms. Peart tries to save Count II by arguing that her Amended Complaint “states,\n\nexplicitly, that . . . [42 U.S.C. § 1981] was violated because of ‘civil rights’ violations” and\n\n“retaliation.” Opp’n at 4. Her argument is unavailing. First, other than a reference to the Civil\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fRights Act of 1964, Count II of her Amended Complaint does not contain the words “civil\n\nrights” or “retaliation,” much less the factual allegations necessary to support a claim of racial\n\ndiscrimination that would “give a defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Second,\n\nMs. Peart cannot correct such a fundamental defect through her Opposition. See Klein v. Am.\n\nLand Title Ass’n, 926 F. Supp. 2d 193, 200-01 (D.D.C. 2013) (rejecting plaintiff’s attempt to\n\n“rais[e] new theories of liability in his opposition briefs, none of which [was] fairly stated in\n\n[his] amended complaint,” because “‘it is axiomatic that a complaint may not be amended by the\n\nbriefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.’” (quoting McManus v. District of Columbia, 530 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 46, 74 n.25 (D.D.C. 2007)).\n\n               Ordinarily, the Court would dismiss an improperly pleaded complaint without\n\nprejudice to permit a plaintiff an opportunity to re-file. The Court will not do so as to Count II,\n\nhowever, because the statute of limitations has expired for Ms. Peart’s § 1981 claim, even if\n\nproperly pled. Section 1981 suits are subject to a three- or four-year limitations period\n\ndepending on the nature of the claim. See Graves v. District of Columbia, 777 F. Supp. 2d 109,\n\n115-16 (D.D.C. 2011) (providing a brief overview of the two limitations periods associated with\n\n§ 1981 claims). This Court need not determine which period applies because Ms. Peart’s § 1981\n\nclaim is time-barred under both. She was terminated on January 24, 2008, but waited more than\n\nfive years to file suit against Latham on April 22, 2013.\n\n               Ms. Peart does not contest that the statute of limitations for her § 1981 claim\n\nbegan to run January 24, 2008. She instead advances equitable tolling and equitable estoppel\n\narguments. Without citation to any case law, she claims that:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f                when pursuing one of several legal remedies, the statute of\n                limitations on the remedies not being pursued will be equitably\n                tolled if the plaintiff can show:\n\n                    •   Timely notice to the adverse party is given within\n                        applicable statute of limitations of filing first claim––and\n                        the Defendant resists those efforts to the detriment of\n                        Plaintiff filing a lawsuit;\n                    •   Lack of prejudice to the defendant;\n                    •   Reasonable good faith conduct on part of the plaintiff.\n\nOpp’n at 4 (emphasis in original). Ms. Peart claims that her “attempts to be re-employed\n\nequitably tolled all statutes of limitations,” and the clock on these limitations periods “arguably”\n\ndid not begin to run until she received EEOC’s Right to Sue letter. Id. Ms. Peart adds that\n\nLatham is equitably estopped from asserting untimeliness because it “resisted” the discrimination\n\nclaim she filed with EEOC and “intentionally dragged the administrative procedures out to let\n\nthe clock keep ticking . . . .” Id. at 5.\n\n                Ms. Peart misapprehends the law of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel.\n\nFirst, her pursuit of administrative action did not toll her § 1981 claim. “[B]ecause a Section\n\n1981 claim is ‘separate from and independent of’ Title VII, the statute of limitations on a Section\n\n1981 . . . claim is not tolled by the pendency of administrative action on a Title VII claim.”\n\nCarter v. District of Columbia, 14 F. Supp. 2d 97, 102 (D.D.C. 1998); see also Johnson v. Ry.\n\nExpress Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 465-66 (1975) (civil rights complainants with pending\n\nEEOC charges should file their § 1981 claims in court and request a stay until the charges are\n\nresolved); Adams v. District of Columbia, 740 F. Supp. 2d 173, 182 (D.D.C. 2010) (“A\n\nlimitations period does not toll when a plaintiff is not required but chooses to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies before pursuing a claim in court.”).\n\n                Second, there is no basis for finding that Ms. Peart’s § 1981 claim should have\n\nbeen tolled as a general matter of equity. “Federal courts have typically extended equitable relief\n\n                                                 16\n\fonly sparingly” in litigation between private parties. Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S.\n\n89, 96 (1990). A party seeking equitable relief from a statute of limitations has a “high” hurdle\n\nto clear. Smith–Haynie, 155 F.3d at 579. Equitable tolling generally requires a showing that the\n\nplaintiff, “despite all due diligence[,] . . . [was] unable to obtain vital information bearing on the\n\nexistence of [her] claim.” Currier v. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc., 159 F.3d 1363,\n\n1367 (D.C. Cir. 1998); accord Norman v. United States, 467 F.3d 773, 776-77 (D.C. Cir. 2006)\n\n(placing onus on plaintiffs to make “reasonable efforts” to learn availability of causes of action).\n\nConversely, equitable estoppel affords relief from a limitations period where the defendant “has\n\ntaken active steps to prevent the plaintiff from litigating in time.” Currier, 159 F.3d at 1367.\n\n                Ms. Peart pins her inaction on her prior pro se status and unemployment,\n\nLatham’s decision to challenge rather than settle her administrative claims, and delays in OHR\n\nproceedings supposedly attributable to Latham by virtue of its status as a large law firm. Opp’n\n\nat 5. Ms. Peart’s lack of legal representation or a job is not grounds for tolling. See Ferguson v.\n\nLocal 689, Amalgamated Transit Union, 626 F. Supp. 2d 55, 61 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Although it\n\nis true that courts liberally construe pro se filings, a case in which a plaintiff fails to meet a\n\nstatutory deadline but attributes it to her pro se status is not one in which a court should toll the\n\nstatute of limitations.” (internal citation omitted)). Likewise, there is no basis in law or reason\n\nfor applying either equity doctrine to this matter merely because Latham mounted a defense\n\nbefore OHR or because the agency proceedings were slow. See Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96\n\n(recognizing appropriateness of tolling “where the complainant has been induced or tricked by\n\nhis adversary’s misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass”); Hunt v. Georgia Dep’t of\n\nCmty. Affairs, 490 F. App’x 196, 198 (11th Cir. 2012) (rejecting “slow administrative\n\nproceedings” as a basis for equitably tolling a statute of limitations).\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f               In short, Ms. Peart has not articulated any action on her part that demonstrates a\n\ndiligent pursuit of the § 1981 claim, nor has she identified any act by Latham that prevented, or\n\nsomehow induced, her into not filing the § 1981 claim before the limitations period expired. Ms.\n\nPeart could have filed the § 1981 claim at any time, but chose to await the completion of OHR’s\n\nmulti-year investigation of her Title VII claim. Applying the “sparingly” invoked equitable\n\ntolling and equitable estoppel doctrines to these facts is unwarranted. Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96.\n\nCount II thus is time-barred and will be dismissed with prejudice.\n\n       B. State-Law Claims\n\n               The Amended Complaint also asserts three-state law claims. Counts III and IV\n\nassert common law causes of action. Ms. Peart claims that Latham breached an implied contract\n\nand wrongfully discharged her (Count III), and intentionally inflicted emotional distress (Count\n\nIV). Count V asserts a violation of DCHRA. The Court will dismiss the common law claims\n\nwith prejudice. The DCHRA claim will remain.\n\n               1. Counts III and IV: Common Law Claims\n\n               It is clear from the face of the Amended Complaint that Ms. Peart’s claims for\n\nbreach of an implied contract, wrongful termination, and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress are time-barred. The D.C. Code states that statutes of limitations for local causes of\n\naction begin to run “from the time the right to maintain the action accrues.” D.C. Code § 12–\n\n301. Although the D.C. Code does not define “accrues,” the D.C. Court of Appeals has\n\ninstructed that “[w]here the fact of an injury can be readily determined, a claim accrues for\n\npurposes of the statute of limitations at the time the injury actually occurs.” Colbert v.\n\nGeorgetown Univ., 641 A.2d 469, 472 (D.C. 1994) (en banc). “If the existence of an injury is\n\nnot readily apparent, however, the claim does not accrue until the plaintiff, exercising due\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fdiligence, has ‘discovered or reasonably should have discovered all of the essential elements of\n\nher possible cause of action, i.e., duty, breach, causation and damages.’” Farris v. Compton, 652\n\nA.2d 49, 54 (D.C. 1994) (quoting Colbert, 641 A.2d at 473).\n\n                Despite Ms. Peart’s protestations to the contrary, her claimed injuries were readily\n\napparent no later than the day she was fired, January 24, 2008. From that date, she had three\n\nyears to complain of breach of an implied contract or wrongful discharge, see Walker v. Pharm.\n\nResearch & Mfrs. of Am., 439 F. Supp. 2d 103, 108 (D.D.C. 2006) (citing D.C. Code § 12-\n\n301(8), the catch-all provision providing three-years for “a limitation . . . not otherwise specially\n\nprescribed”); D.C. Code § 12-301(7) (three-year limitations period for implied contracts), and, at\n\nbest four years to file a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. 1 In waiting until\n\nApril 22, 2013 to file suit, more than five years after her termination, Ms. Peart brought her\n\nimplied contract, wrongful discharge, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims too\n\nlate.\n\n                Ms. Peart’s attempt to evade the statutes of limitations through equitable tolling\n\nand equitable estoppel are as unavailing here as in the context of her untimely 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nclaim. “‘Except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by acts of Congress, the law\n\nto be applied in any case is the law of the state.’” Novak v. Capital Mgmt. & Dev. Corp., 452\n\n\n\n1\n  The three-year limitations period of D.C. Code § 12-301(8) also applies to intentional infliction\nof emotional distress claims, Rendall-Speranza v. Nassim, 107 F.3d 913, 920 (D.C. Cir. 1997),\nunless the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim is “intertwined with any of the causes\nof action for which a period of limitation is specifically provided,” id. (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). In such instances, the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim\nadopts the specifically prescribed limitations period. Id. Although the case law is silent as to\nhow this principle operates where, as here, there are multiple intertwined causes of action with\nstatutes of limitation of varying lengths, the Court can assume without deciding that the\napplicable limitations period for Ms. Peart’s intentional infliction of emotional distress is the\nfour-year period sometimes associated with 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims––the longest statute of\nlimitations among her claims.\n                                                  19\n\fF.3d 902, 907 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938)).\n\nThis principle extends to the District of Columbia. Id. Because D.C. law controls, accord\n\nJankovic v. Int’l Crisis Group, 494 F.3d 1080, 1086-87 (D.C. Cir. 2007), there is no equity end-\n\nrun around D.C.’s statutes of limitations. “District of Columbia law does not recognize an\n\nequitable tolling exception to the statute of limitations,” Johnson v. Marcheta Investors Ltd.\n\nP’ship, 711 A.2d 109, 112 (D.C. 1998) (citing Sayyad v. Fawzi, 674 A.2d 905, 906 (D.C. 1996)),\n\nand equitable estoppel is limited to those circumstances in which the defendant takes an\n\naffirmative step “that would tend to lull the plaintiff into inaction, . . . thereby permit[ting] the\n\nlimitation [period] . . . to run,” East v. Graphic Arts Indus. Joint Pension Trust, 718 A.2d 153,\n\n157 (D.C. 1998) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n\n                Ms. Peart asserts the same argument for equitable estoppel here as she does for\n\nher 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claim, and the outcome is no different. The only act of Latham’s that Ms.\n\nPeart cites as a basis for equitable estoppel is Latham’s defense of itself in the OHR proceedings.\n\nThis action, however, does not amount to any inducement to Ms. Peart to delay bringing her\n\ncommon law claims. Jones v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co., 621 A.2d 845, 847 (D.C. 1993) (“[I]n order\n\nto show a ‘lulling,’ concrete evidence must be presented that clearly establishes that such activity\n\noccurred.”). Latham was entitled to defend itself. Ms. Peart’s bald assertion that “one can\n\nreasonably conclude” from Latham’s status as a large law firm that the purpose of its defense\n\nwas to run out the limitations periods is neither reasonable nor a conclusion. Opp’n at 5. It is an\n\nunsupported insinuation of misconduct. Counts III and IV are time-barred and dismissed with\n\nprejudice. 2\n\n\n\n2\n  Consequently, the Court does not reach Latham’s arguments that Ms. Peart’s intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress claim is without an adequate prima facie showing and is\npreempted by the D.C. Workers’ Compensation Act, D.C. Code §§ 32-1501 et seq., or that Ms.\n                                                   20\n\f               2. Count V: D.C. Human Rights Act Claim\n\n               The Court at this time cannot determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover Ms. Peart’s DCHRA claim. DCHRA contains an election of remedies provision, which\n\nstates in relevant part that “[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction . . . unless such person\n\nhas filed a complaint” with OHR. D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a). The D.C. Court of Appeals has\n\nexplained that this provision makes the jurisdiction of the courts and OHR “mutually exclusive\n\nin the first instance. . . . [W]here one opts to file with [the] OHR, he or she generally may not\n\nalso file a complaint in court.” Brown v. Capitol Hill Club, 425 A.2d 1309, 1311 (D.C. 1981).\n\nUnder the statute, plaintiffs who pursue an administrative adjudication of their DCHRA claim\n\nmay regain the ability to pursue such a suit in court only “if (1) OHR dismisses the complaint for\n\n‘administrative convenience’ or (2) the complainant withdraws her OHR complaint before OHR\n\nhas decided it.” Carter v. District of Columbia, 980 A.2d 1217, 1223 (D.C. 2009) (citing D.C.\n\nCode § 2-1403.16(a)).\n\n               Latham argues that this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction to consider\n\nMs. Peart’s DCHRA claim because it has been litigated to conclusion before OHR. Latham\n\nnotes that OHR issued a finding of “no probable cause” on March 18, 2011, and affirmed this\n\ndecision in a letter dated March 29, 2012, which explicitly deemed its determination as “final.”\n\nAccording to Latham, there is no indication in the record that Ms. Peart ever withdrew her OHR\n\ncharge or that OHR dismissed her charge for administrative convenience.\n\n               Ms. Peart agrees with Latham that D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a) requires plaintiffs\n\nchoose a forum for litigating their discrimination claims. She instead argues that one of two\n\n\nPeart failed to establish that her employment at Latham was anything other than at-will for\npurposes of her breach of an implied contract and wrongful discharge claims.\n                                                 21\n\fexceptions applies. Ms. Peart maintains that she “was not required to withdraw her DCHRA\n\nclaims after OHR reversed its decision of no probable cause; she had a choice: mediate or file a\n\nlawsuit. She has chosen the latter. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction; clearly, as there\n\nwas no final determination of her DCHRA claims . . . .” Opp’n at 6. Seemingly oblivious to\n\nOHR’s March 29, 2012 letter, Ms. Peart accuses Latham of “mis-represent[ing] the decisions of\n\nthe DCOHR to this Court,” and stresses that “there was no final decision reached as to [her]\n\nclaims because there was a reversal of the ‘no probable cause’ finding.” Id. at 3. Ms. Peart does\n\nnot address why OHR’s March 29, 2012 affirmation of its probable cause determination would\n\nnot render her administrative charge fully litigated.\n\n                In making these arguments, however, both parties overlook an important\n\nantecedent question. Ms. Peart did not file a charge with OHR. Instead, she filed her charge\n\nwith EEOC, which administratively transferred it to OHR under the agencies’ work-sharing\n\nagreement. Mar. 18, 2011 Letter at 1 n.1. The unnoticed issue is whether Ms. Peart’s EEOC\n\nfiling constituted a filing with OHR within the meaning of D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a). An\n\nanswer in the affirmative would mean that this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nCount V.\n\n                The D.C. Court of Appeals has avoided addressing this issue on at least two\n\noccasions. In Griffin v. Acacia Life Insurance Co., 925 A.2d 564 (D.C. 2007), an employee filed\n\na charge with EEOC which cross-filed it with OHR pursuant to a work-sharing agreement, id. at\n\n567-69. EEOC dismissed the charge because “it would ‘not be able to prove’” the allegations of\n\ndiscrimination, id. at 567, and sent the plaintiff a right-to-sue letter, id. After a series of\n\nproceedings in federal court, the Title VII claims were dismissed and the court declined to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the DCHRA claims. The plaintiff then brought a\n\n\n\n                                                   22\n\fDCHRA lawsuit in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia. Id. at 571. The Superior\n\nCourt dismissed the plaintiff’s DCHRA retaliation claim, ruling that because EEOC had cross-\n\nfiled her claim with OHR, the plaintiff had elected an administrative remedy, and was barred by\n\nthe doctrine of election of remedies from pursuing her DCHRA claim in court. Id. at 572. On\n\nappeal, the plaintiff argued that even if she had pursued an administrative remedy, OHR\n\ndismissed her charge “for administrative convenience.” Id. at 573. The D.C. Court of Appeals\n\nagreed, deciding it did not have to reach the issue of whether EEOC’s automatic cross-filing with\n\nOHR constituted the filing of a charge with OHR for purposes of election of remedies because\n\nOHR had dismissed the charge on administrative convenience grounds.\n\n               Similarly, in Estenos v. PAHO/WHO Federal Credit Union, 952 A.2d 878 (D.C.\n\n2008), an employee filed a charge with EEOC, which then cross-filed it with OHR, id. at 884.\n\nEEOC issued a Right to Sue Letter more than a year later and the plaintiff filed suit in D.C.\n\nSuperior Court under DCHRA. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint as time-barred,\n\narguing that DCHRA’s one-year statute of limitations is tolled only where a charge is filed\n\ndirectly with OHR. The trial court denied the motion. Id. at 884-85. The D.C. Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the trial court’s ruling, explaining that the procedural requirements of OHR and EEOC\n\n“are to be read broadly and flexibly in the employee’s favor in light of their remedial purposes\n\nand because they are designed for lay persons.” Id. at 885-86. The Estenos Court determined\n\nthat whether DCHRA is read broadly or literally, “a plaintiff does not need to file personally\n\nwith OHR to satisfy the statute’s tolling requirement.” Id. at 885. The D.C. Court of Appeals,\n\nhowever, did not address the statute’s election of remedies language.\n\n               The parties have not presented the Court with any arguments as to how these, or\n\nother cases, should apply to the instant matter. Moreover, neither party has provided the Court\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fwith a copy of the work-sharing agreement that was in effect at the time Ms. Peart filed her\n\ncharge with EEOC. The Court cannot begin to apply the applicable case law without knowing\n\nthe full extent of the agreement between EEOC and OHR. Because Ms. Peart has not made clear\n\nthe Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over her DCHRA count, Akinseye, 339 F.3d at 971, Count\n\nV remains pending. 3\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Latham’s\n\nMotion to Dismiss, Dkt. 14, grant Latham’s Motion to Take Judicial Notice, Dkt. 15, and deny\n\nMs. Peart’s request for judicial notice, Dkt. 16. A memorializing Order accompanies this\n\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                                           /s/\n                                                            ROSEMARY M.

The Court does not reach this argument\nat this time. Determining whether Ms. Peart’s DCHRA claim is untimely would constitute an\nexercise of the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction, accord Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500,\n510 (2006) (“[T]ime prescription, however emphatic, ‘are not properly typed jurisdictional.’”\n(quoting Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 414 (2004))), and the Court cannot determine at\nthis time whether it has such jurisdiction over her DCHRA claim.\n                                               24\n\f",

She also alleges several state-law claims. Latham & Watkins moves to\n\ndismiss on various grounds, including lack of subject matter jurisdiction, untimeliness, and\n\nfailure to state a claim. The motion will be granted in part for the reasons explained below.\n\n                                             I. FACTS\n\n                  According to the Amended Complaint, Latham & Watkins LLP (Latham) hired\n\nDemetria Peart, an African American woman, as a legal secretary in April 2007. Six months\n\nlater, Ms. Peart learned that she was pregnant and notified her secretarial supervisor. She\n\ncontinued to work until serious medical complications relating to her pregnancy forced her in\n\nNovember 2007 to go on doctor-mandated bed rest. Ms. Peart subsequently sought, and\n\nreceived, short-term disability payments. Am. Compl. [Dkt. 11] ¶¶ 1, 3, 4, 9; Mot. to Dismiss\n\n[Dkt. 14] at 3.\n\n                  Ms. Peart asserts that Latham terminated her on January 24, 2008. She claims\n\nthat Christopher Carr, Latham’s human resources manager, informed her on January 24 via a\n\n\n                                                  1\n\ftelephone call that she was fired from the firm because “she was no longer needed,” adding that\n\n“her pregnancy complications were not his problem.” Am. Compl. ¶ 10. Ms. Peart later learned\n\nthat Mr. Carr had told other Latham personnel that she had been terminated because of “damn\n\nthirteen weeks [of] morning sickness” and that her pregnancy was “not [their] concern.” Id.\n\n¶ 11.\n\n               In early 2008, Ms. Peart filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (EEOC) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e–\n\n2000e-17, alleging discrimination based on gender and pregnancy. Pursuant to a “work-sharing\n\nagreement” between EEOC and the D.C. Office of Human Rights (OHR), Ms. Peart’s case was\n\n“transferred” to OHR on July 14, 2008. Def.’s Mot. Judicial Notice [Dkt. 15], Ex. 1 (Mar. 18,\n\n2011 OHR Letter) [Dkt. 15-2] at 1 n.1. OHR then issued a finding on March 18, 2011, that there\n\nwas “NO PROBABLE CAUSE [sic] to believe that [Latham] subjected [Ms. Peart] to disparate\n\ntreatment based on sex (female/pregnant) when she was allegedly terminated from her position\n\nas Legal Secretary while out of work on doctor-mandated bed rest.” Id. at 9. Ms. Peart\n\nsubsequently asked OHR to reconsider its decision. After Latham failed to oppose Ms. Peart’s\n\nreconsideration request, OHR issued a decision on September 6, 2011, reversing its initial “no\n\nprobable cause” determination and ordering a hearing before the D.C. Human Rights\n\nCommission. Id., Ex. 2 (Sept. 6, 2011 OHR Letter) [Dkt. 15-3] at 3. This decision, however,\n\nwas deemed void following the revelation that Latham had not received notice of the\n\nreconsideration due to “clerical errors.” Id., Ex. 3 (Mar. 29, 2012 OHR Letter) [Dkt. 15-4] at 2.\n\nOHR reviewed Latham’s opposition to Ms. Peart’s reconsideration request and issued a new\n\ndecision on March 29, 2012. It found that because Ms. Peart was delinquent in responding to\n\nLatham’s requests for information regarding her ability to return to work, there was “no evidence\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fdemonstrating that [Latham’s] actions were pretext for discrimination.” Id. at 6. OHR affirmed\n\nits “no probable cause” finding, and informed Ms. Peart that the March 29 letter was a final\n\ndecision from which she had three years to seek judicial review in D.C. Superior Court. Id. at 6-\n\n7.\n\n               For reasons unexplained in the record, more than five years after her termination,\n\nEEOC finally issued a “Right to Sue” letter to Ms. Peart on April 18, 2013. See id., Ex. 4 (Apr.\n\n18, 2013 EEOC Right to Sue Letter) [Dkt. 15-5]. Ms. Peart filed her original Complaint in this\n\nmatter four days later. See Compl. [Dkt. 1]. Latham moved to dismiss the Complaint, see Mot.\n\nto Dismiss [Dkt. 8], and Ms. Peart filed an Amended Complaint on June 1, 2013. See Am.\n\nCompl.\n\n               The Amended Complaint contains five counts: violation of Title VII, as amended\n\nby the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k), (Count I); violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981 (Count II); breach of an implied contract and wrongful discharge (Count III); intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress (Count IV); and violation of the D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n(DCHRA), D.C. Code §§ 2-1401.01 et seq. (Count V). On June 20, 2013, Latham again moved\n\nto dismiss and requested judicial notice of certain documentation. See Mot to Dismiss; Def.’s\n\nMot. Judicial Notice. Ms. Peart opposes the motion to dismiss, is silent as to Latham’s request\n\nfor judicial notice, and asks the Court to take judicial notice of an affidavit from a former Latham\n\nemployee. See Opp’n [Dkt. 16].\n\n                                   II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n               Latham’s Motion to Dismiss requires the Court to resolve three issues. One is\n\njurisdictional. Counts I and II are federal law claims and Counts III, IV, and V are state law\n\nclaims. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether it should exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the state causes of action. The other two issues concern the propriety of\n                                                 3\n\fdismissing a complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\nSpecifically, Latham has moved to dismiss the claims alleged in the Amended Complaint for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and untimeliness.\n\n       A. Jurisdiction\n\n               Federal district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under\n\nfederal statutes. 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In certain circumstances, § 1331 may also provide a federal\n\ncourt with an independent basis for exercising jurisdiction over related state-law claims. Women\n\nPrisoners of the D.C. Dep’t of Corr. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724981\"><a href=\"/opinion/724981/women-prisoners-of-the-district-of-columbia-department-of-corrections-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 920 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nTo determine when the assertion of supplemental jurisdiction is appropriate, the district court\n\napplies a two-part test. Id. (citing United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (1966)).\n\n               First, the district court must determine whether the state and the\n               federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact; if\n               they do, the court has the power, under Article III of the\n               Constitution, to hear the state claim. Second, even if it concludes\n               that it has that power, the district court must then decide whether to\n               exercise its discretion to assert jurisdiction over the state issue.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotations omitted). In deciding whether to assert supplemental\n\njurisdiction over a state-law claim, the court should consider whether judicial economy,\n\nconvenience and fairness to litigants weigh in favor of doing so. A court may decline to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction, however, if the state claim raises a novel or complex issue of state\n\nlaw, substantially predominates over the federal claims, or remains after the court has dismissed\n\nthe federal claims. Id. at 921 (citing the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1367). If\n\na federal court invokes its supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claim, then it “is bound to\n\napply the law of the forum state to the same extent as if it were exercising its diversity\n\njurisdiction.” Super Sulky, Inc. v.

Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n               Latham moves to dismiss Count V under FRCP 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction. When considering such a motion, a court reviews the complaint liberally,\n\ngranting the plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged. Barr\n\nv.

Failure to State a Claim\n\n               Latham’s motion to dismiss Counts I, II, III, and IV under FRCP 12(b)(6)\n\nchallenges the adequacy of the Amended Complaint allegations on their face. Such a motion\n\ntests whether a plaintiff has properly stated a claim. FRCP 8(a), on which Latham relies,\n\nrequires that a complaint contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).

ANALYSIS\n\n               Before delving into Latham’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court will address two\n\npreliminary issues. First, the Court will analyze the bases for its exercise of original and\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the federal-law and state-law claims. Second, the Court will\n\naddress the parties’ respective requests for judicial notice. Finding jurisdiction exists over the\n\nfederal and state claims, the Court then will consider whether any of the counts alleged in the\n\nAmended Complaint survive Latham’s dismissal motion.\n\n       A. Original and Supplemental Jurisdiction\n\n               The basis for this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over Ms. Peart’s federal-law\n\nclaims is clear. Counts I and II allege violations of two federal statutes: Title VII and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981. These claims thus present questions of federal law. The Court accordingly has original\n\njurisdiction with respect to Counts I and II. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n               Counts III, IV, and V, on the other hand, are state-law claims. They nonetheless\n\nstem from the same events as the federal-law claims: Ms. Peart’s pregnancy, leave from work,\n\nand subsequent termination. The Court therefore concludes that Ms. Peart’s federal and state\n                                                  7\n\fcounts arise from one “common nucleus of operative fact.” As such, her state-law claims are\n\npart of the same “case or controversy” under Article III. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). Because the facts\n\nunderlying Ms. Peart’s federal-law and state-law claims substantially overlap, the Court\n\nconcludes that judicial economy, comity, convenience, and fairness weigh in favor of hearing\n\nboth sets of claims in the same proceeding. Finally, the Court holds that Ms. Peart’s claims of\n\nbreach of an implied contract, wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress,\n\nand violation of DCHRA are not novel or complex issues of state law that lie beyond the ken of\n\nthis Court. Id. § 1367(c). The Court thus elects to retain its supplemental jurisdiction over Ms.\n\nPeart’s state-law claims. It will apply the law of the District of Columbia to these counts.\n\n       B. Requests for Judicial Notice\n\n                Turning to the Latham’s and Ms. Peart’s requests for judicial notice, the Court\n\nwill grant the former and deny the latter. Latham asks the Court to take judicial notice of four\n\ndocuments: OHR’s letters dated March 18, 2011, September 6, 2011, and March 29, 2012,\n\nregarding Ms. Peart’s discrimination claims; and EEOC’s Right to Sue letter dated April 18,\n\n2013. See Def.’s Mot. Judicial Notice, Exs. 1-4. Mrs. Peart does not oppose this request. She\n\ninstead asks the Court to take judicial notice of the affidavit of Marquita Chambers, a legal\n\nsecretary at Latham from June to October 2007, which provides Ms. Chambers’s impression of\n\nMs. Peart’s work ethic, pregnancy complications, and termination. See Opp’n, Ex. 6 (Chambers\n\nAff.) [16-1].\n\n                In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), a court\n\nmay take judicial notice of public records from other proceedings, Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v.\n\nChao, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187030\"><a href=\"/opinion/187030/abhe-svoboda-inc-v-chao/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1059 (D.C.

Cir.\n\n2011). Here, the Court finds it appropriate to take judicial notice of the facts contained in the\n\nOHR and EEOC letters as they “can be accurately and readily determined” from a public agency\n\nproceeding, the accuracy of which “cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2).\n\nThe Court conversely deems it inappropriate to take judicial notice of Ms. Chamber’s affidavit.\n\nThe accuracy of Ms. Chambers’s affidavit, which is riddled with hearsay, cannot be readily\n\ndetermined and is subject to questioning since it reflects an individual’s personal opinions.\n\nMoreover, the topics on which Ms. Chambers opines are superfluous to the issues pertinent to\n\nthe instant motion to dismiss. Latham contends that Ms. Peart’s Amended Complaint must be\n\ndismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction and a lapse of the applicable statutes of\n\nlimitations. Whether Ms. Chambers perceived Ms. Peart to be dedicated to her job, understood\n\nMs. Peart’s pregnancy to have been difficult, or thought Ms. Peart’s termination was\n\n“shock[ing],” Chambers Aff. ¶¶ 4-6, is irrelevant to the proceeding at this juncture.\n\n       C. Federal-Law Claims\n\n               The federal-law claims asserted in the Amended Complaint are limited to two\n\ncounts. Count I asserts a violation of Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination\n\nAct, and Count II asserts a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. For the reasons below, the Court will\n\ndismiss in part Count I without prejudice and dismiss Count II with prejudice.\n\n               1. Count I: Title VII Claim\n\n               As for Count I, Ms. Peart’s Title VII allegations, the Court will partially grant\n\nLatham’s Motion to Dismiss. Count I reads in relevant part:\n\n               Defendant, by and through its employees, conspired to deny\n               Plaintiff Peart of her employment rights, as guaranteed by the\n\n                                                 9\n\f               [Pregnancy Discrimination Act] and Title VII, by creating a hostile\n               work environment, treating her disparately and discriminating\n               against her in her employment on the basis of her pregnancy and\n               gender.    Plaintiff Peart was subjected to said employment\n               conditions based solely on her pregnancy discrimination [sic] and\n               gender––and was subjected to said conditions when those in non-\n               protected categories were treated differently and favorably in their\n               employment.\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 16. Latham’s dismissal motion addresses Count I inasmuch as Ms. Peart asserts a\n\nviolation of Title VII based on a hostile work environment. Latham contends that the hostile\n\nwork environment allegation must be dismissed for failure to establish a sufficient basis for\n\nrelief. The Court agrees.\n\n               Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978. That Act amended\n\nTitle VII to prohibit an employer from discriminating “on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or\n\nrelated medical conditions,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k), in hiring or firing; compensation; terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment; or otherwise limiting, segregating, or classifying\n\nemployees in a way that would adversely affect their status as employees, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(a). The Supreme Court has determined that the “terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment” language “evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of\n\ndisparate treatment of men and women in employment, which includes requiring people to work\n\nin a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.” Harris v.

Therefore, Title VII is violated when a\n\nplaintiff demonstrates that the “workplace is permeated with ‘discriminatory intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult,’” id. at 21 (quoting Meritor Sav.

(quoting Meritor, 477\n\nU.S. at 67). To establish a prima facie hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must\n\n                                                 10\n\fdemonstrate that (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) she was subject to unwelcome\n\nharassment, (3) the harassment occurred because of her membership in the protected class,\n\n(4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment, and (5) the employer\n\nknew or should have known of the harassment, and failed to act to prevent it.

She alleges that Christopher Carr, Latham’s\n\nmanager of human resources, informed her by phone that she was fired from the firm because\n\n“she was no longer needed,” and added that “her pregnancy complications were not his\n\nproblem.” Am. Compl. ¶ 10. Ms. Peart also claims that Mr. Carr told other Latham personnel\n\nthat she was terminated because of her “damn thirteen weeks [of] morning sickness” and that her\n\npregnancy was “not [the firm’s] concern.” Id. ¶ 11. Presuming these allegations to be true, as\n\nthe Court must at this stage in the proceedings, they are insufficiently pervasive or severe to\n\nconstitute a hostile work environment, as pled in the Amended Complaint. They were isolated,\n\noccurring only twice. Moreover, they were not sufficiently extreme so as to support a finding\n\nthat the comments would have interfered with Ms. Peart’s ability to return to work or\n\nunreasonably affected her work performance once she returned. Accordingly, the Court will\n\ndismiss without prejudice Ms. Peart’s hostile work environment claim under Title VII.\n\n               The Court will not dismiss Count I outright, however. Although obscured by\n\nmaladroit pleading, Count I appears to be broader than just a hostile work environment claim\n\nunder Title VII. A fair reading of Count I demonstrates that Ms. Peart also has pled gender and\n\npregnancy discrimination and disparate treatment. Neither party, however, acknowledges this\n\npoint. Latham construes Count I as “limited to a single claim” of hostile work environment,\n\nMot. to Dismiss at 16, and Ms. Peart’s counsel does not correct this reading. Nonetheless, the\n\nCourt finds that, under the precepts of Twombly and Iqbal, Ms. Peart has stated sufficient facts to\n\nmake out at least a discrimination claim. The Complaint provides Latham with fair notice.\n\nFurther, the facts alleged raise Ms. Peart’s right to relief above a speculative level, Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 555, such that Count I has facial plausibility, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Count I therefore\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fsurvives Latham’s Motion to Dismiss inasmuch as it asserts discrimination and disparate\n\ntreatment in violation of Title VII.\n\n               2. Count II: 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\n               With respect to Count II, Ms. Peart accuses Latham of violating 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\n“by creating a hostile work environment and discriminating against [her] both on the basis of her\n\npregnancy and gender.” Am. Compl. ¶ 18. Latham contends that Count II must be dismissed for\n\nfailure to state a claim because § 1981 is inapplicable to the discrimination claims that Ms.\n\nPeart’s alleges. The Court agrees.\n\n               Section 1981 does not provide a cause of action for pregnancy or gender\n\ndiscrimination. The statute reads, in relevant part:\n\n               All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have\n               the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce\n               contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and\n               equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\n               persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n               subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and\n               exactions of every kind, and to no other.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) (emphasis added). As is clear from the statute’s language, § 1981 is limited\n\nto racial discrimination. See Runyon v. McCrary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109509\"><a href=\"/opinion/109509/runyon-v-mccrary/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (1976) (stating that 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981 only prohibits racial discrimination and not sex or religious discrimination); Bello\n\nv.

Second,\n\nMs. Peart cannot correct such a fundamental defect through her Opposition. See Klein v.

She instead advances equitable tolling and equitable estoppel\n\narguments. Without citation to any case law, she claims that:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f                when pursuing one of several legal remedies, the statute of\n                limitations on the remedies not being pursued will be equitably\n                tolled if the plaintiff can show:\n\n                    •   Timely notice to the adverse party is given within\n                        applicable statute of limitations of filing first claim––and\n                        the Defendant resists those efforts to the detriment of\n                        Plaintiff filing a lawsuit;\n                    •   Lack of prejudice to the defendant;\n                    •   Reasonable good faith conduct on part of the plaintiff.\n\nOpp’n at 4 (emphasis in original).

Likewise, there is no basis in law or reason\n\nfor applying either equity doctrine to this matter merely because Latham mounted a defense\n\nbefore OHR or because the agency proceedings were slow. See Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96\n\n(recognizing appropriateness of tolling “where the complainant has been induced or tricked by\n\nhis adversary’s misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass”); Hunt v. Georgia Dep’t of\n\nCmty. Affairs, 490 F.

Ms.\n\nPeart could have filed the § 1981 claim at any time, but chose to await the completion of OHR’s\n\nmulti-year investigation of her Title VII claim. Applying the “sparingly” invoked equitable\n\ntolling and equitable estoppel doctrines to these facts is unwarranted. Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96.\n\nCount II thus is time-barred and will be dismissed with prejudice.\n\n       B. State-Law Claims\n\n               The Amended Complaint also asserts three-state law claims. Counts III and IV\n\nassert common law causes of action. Ms. Peart claims that Latham breached an implied contract\n\nand wrongfully discharged her (Count III), and intentionally inflicted emotional distress (Count\n\nIV). Count V asserts a violation of DCHRA. The Court will dismiss the common law claims\n\nwith prejudice. The DCHRA claim will remain.\n\n               1. Counts III and IV: Common Law Claims\n\n               It is clear from the face of the Amended Complaint that Ms. Peart’s claims for\n\nbreach of an implied contract, wrongful termination, and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress are time-barred. The D.C. Code states that statutes of limitations for local causes of\n\naction begin to run “from the time the right to maintain the action accrues.” D.C. Code § 12–\n\n301. Although the D.C. Code does not define “accrues,” the D.C. Court of Appeals has\n\ninstructed that “[w]here the fact of an injury can be readily determined, a claim accrues for\n\npurposes of the statute of limitations at the time the injury actually occurs.” Colbert v.\n\nGeorgetown Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (D.C. 1994) (en banc). “If the existence of an injury is\n\nnot readily apparent, however, the claim does not accrue until the plaintiff, exercising due\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fdiligence, has ‘discovered or reasonably should have discovered all of the essential elements of\n\nher possible cause of action, i.e., duty, breach, causation and damages.’” Farris v.

Seemingly oblivious to\n\nOHR’s March 29, 2012 letter, Ms. Peart accuses Latham of “mis-represent[ing] the decisions of\n\nthe DCOHR to this Court,” and stresses that “there was no final decision reached as to [her]\n\nclaims because there was a reversal of the ‘no probable cause’ finding.” Id. at 3. Ms. Peart does\n\nnot address why OHR’s March 29, 2012 affirmation of its probable cause determination would\n\nnot render her administrative charge fully litigated.\n\n                In making these arguments, however, both parties overlook an important\n\nantecedent question. Ms. Peart did not file a charge with OHR. Instead, she filed her charge\n\nwith EEOC, which administratively transferred it to OHR under the agencies’ work-sharing\n\nagreement. Mar. 18, 2011 Letter at 1 n.1. The unnoticed issue is whether Ms. Peart’s EEOC\n\nfiling constituted a filing with OHR within the meaning of D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a). An\n\nanswer in the affirmative would mean that this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nCount V.\n\n                The D.C. Court of Appeals has avoided addressing this issue on at least two\n\noccasions. In Griffin v. Acacia Life Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. 2007), an employee filed\n\na charge with EEOC which cross-filed it with OHR pursuant to a work-sharing agreement, id. at\n\n567-69. EEOC dismissed the charge because “it would ‘not be able to prove’” the allegations of\n\ndiscrimination, id. at 567, and sent the plaintiff a right-to-sue letter, id. After a series of\n\nproceedings in federal court, the Title VII claims were dismissed and the court declined to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the DCHRA claims. The plaintiff then brought a\n\n\n\n                                                   22\n\fDCHRA lawsuit in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia. Id. at 571. The Superior\n\nCourt dismissed the plaintiff’s DCHRA retaliation claim, ruling that because EEOC had cross-\n\nfiled her claim with OHR, the plaintiff had elected an administrative remedy, and was barred by\n\nthe doctrine of election of remedies from pursuing her DCHRA claim in court. Id. at 572. On\n\nappeal, the plaintiff argued that even if she had pursued an administrative remedy, OHR\n\ndismissed her charge “for administrative convenience.” Id. at 573. The D.C. Court of Appeals\n\nagreed, deciding it did not have to reach the issue of whether EEOC’s automatic cross-filing with\n\nOHR constituted the filing of a charge with OHR for purposes of election of remedies because\n\nOHR had dismissed the charge on administrative convenience grounds.\n\n               Similarly, in Estenos v. PAHO/WHO Federal Credit Union, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\n\n2008), an employee filed a charge with EEOC, which then cross-filed it with OHR, id. at 884.\n\nEEOC issued a Right to Sue Letter more than a year later and the plaintiff filed suit in D.C.\n\nSuperior Court under DCHRA. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint as time-barred,\n\narguing that DCHRA’s one-year statute of limitations is tolled only where a charge is filed\n\ndirectly with OHR. The trial court denied the motion. Id. at 884-85. The D.C. Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the trial court’s ruling, explaining that the procedural requirements of OHR and EEOC\n\n“are to be read broadly and flexibly in the employee’s favor in light of their remedial purposes\n\nand because they are designed for lay persons.” Id. at 885-86. The Estenos Court determined\n\nthat whether DCHRA is read broadly or literally, “a plaintiff does not need to file personally\n\nwith OHR to satisfy the statute’s tolling requirement.” Id. at 885. The D.C. Court of Appeals,\n\nhowever, did not address the statute’s election of remedies language.\n\n               The parties have not presented the Court with any arguments as to how these, or\n\nother cases, should apply to the instant matter. Moreover, neither party has provided the Court\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fwith a copy of the work-sharing agreement that was in effect at the time Ms. Peart filed her\n\ncharge with EEOC. The Court cannot begin to apply the applicable case law without knowing\n\nthe full extent of the agreement between EEOC and OHR. Because Ms. Peart has not made clear\n\nthe Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over her DCHRA count, Akinseye, 339 F.3d at 971, Count\n\nV remains pending. 3\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Latham’s\n\nMotion to Dismiss, Dkt. 14, grant Latham’s Motion to Take Judicial Notice, Dkt. 15, and deny\n\nMs. Peart’s request for judicial notice, Dkt. 16. A memorializing Order accompanies this\n\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                                           /s/\n                                                            ROSEMARY M. COLLYER\nDate: October 23, 2013                                      United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Latham also moves to dismiss Count V as time-barred. The Court does not reach this argument\nat this time. Determining whether Ms. Peart’s DCHRA claim is untimely would constitute an\nexercise of the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction, accord Arbaugh v.
