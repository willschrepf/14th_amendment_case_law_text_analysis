After filing a voluntary chapter 11 petition, Debtor\n 7   claimed the full amount in that bank account as exempt.         The\n 8   bankruptcy court overruled Appellants’ objection to the\n 9   exemption based on its interpretation of California law.         We\n10   disagree with the bankruptcy court’s rationale, but we agree\n11   that the objection lacks merit.       As a result, we AFFIRM.\n12                                   FACTS\n13        Debtor filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition.       On\n14   Schedule A/B, she listed $30,000 in a Chase Bank deposit account\n15   (the “SSI Account”).    On Schedule C, she claimed the full amount\n16   in the SSI Account as exempt under California Code of Civil\n17   Procedure (“CCP”) § 703.140(b)(10)(A).\n18        Debtor’s § 341(a) creditors’ meeting was continued until\n19   June 24, 2016, and a review of the entire docket indicates that\n20   it concluded on that date.2    Debtor later, on July 7, 2016,\n21\n22        **\n             The Hon. Fredrick E. Clement, United States Bankruptcy\n23   Judge for the Eastern District of California, sitting by\n     designation.\n24\n          1\n             Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n25   references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532.\n     All “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n26\n     Procedure.\n27        2\n               We exercise our discretion to take judicial notice of\n28                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                       2\n\f 1   amended her Schedule C, but she did not amend her claim of\n 2   exemption in the SSI Account in any respect.\n 3        On July 26, 2016, Appellants objected to four of Debtor’s\n 4   claimed exemptions, including, as relevant here, her exemption\n 5   of the SSI Account.   They argued that CCP § 703.140(b)(10)(A)\n 6   did not apply because it exempted only the future right to\n 7   receive payments and did not exempt payments already received.\n 8        Debtor, naturally, opposed.      First, she argued that nothing\n 9   in CCP § 703.140(b)(10)(A) “limits its protection to the right\n10   to receive future social security payments.     A debtor can exempt\n11   money already received as a social security benefit.”     Second,\n12   she contended that she established the SSI Account specifically\n13   for use with her social security income, explained that she\n14   deposited her social security income into the SSI Account, and\n15   argued that on the petition date the money in the SSI Account,\n16   therefore, was exempt.\n17        In reply, Appellants augmented their original argument with\n18   the observation that, if the California legislature had intended\n19   to exempt more than future social security income, it would have\n20   included language similar to that found in CCP § 703.140(b)(11).\n21   That statute provides an exemption not only for the “debtor’s\n22   right to receive [certain payments]” but also for “property that\n23   is traceable to [the payment]”.\n24        At the hearing on the exemption objections, Debtor’s\n25\n26        2\n           (...continued)\n27   documents electronically filed in the underlying bankruptcy\n     case. See Atwood v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Co. (In re Atwood),\n28   293 B.R. 227, 233 n.9 (9th Cir. BAP 2003).\n\n                                       3\n\f 1   counsel added a “couple of things” to his client’s opposition.\n 2   Hr’g Tr. (Sept. 20, 2016) 5:12-14.      He started: “First off,\n 3   counsel is correct with the – with respect to the Social\n 4   Security and there is a different statute that protects\n 5   prepetition paid Social Security.      It’s 42 U.S.C.\n 6   Section 407(a).   And so there’s a simple solution to dealing\n 7   with that.   I can simply amend Schedule C to apply that . . . .”\n 8   Hr’g Tr. 5:14-19.   The bankruptcy court clarified: “Are you now\n 9   abandoning the argument that 703.140(b)(10)([A]) does not\n10   include Social Security benefits that have been paid?”      Hr’g Tr.\n11   7:5-7.   “No,” started Debtor’s counsel, but the bankruptcy court\n12   interjected: “You’re just saying there’s also a federal\n13   exemption, though?”    Hr’g Tr. 7:8-10.    Debtor’s counsel agreed:\n14   “Exactly.”   Hr’g Tr. 7:11.\n15        After further argument, the bankruptcy court ruled on other\n16   exemptions not relevant to this appeal and then turned to the\n17   SSI Account objection:\n18        As to the objection as to the Social Security\n          benefits, again, there’s nothing in the statute that\n19        limits it to benefits -- Social Security benefits that\n          are to be provided or to be received, as opposed to\n20        Social Security benefits that have been received, as\n          well as those coming in the future. I have evidence\n21        from the debtor in response to the motion that she has\n          segregated her Social Security benefits and that\n22        everything in that account is only Social Security\n          benefits.\n23\n24   Hr’g Tr. 10:19–11:2.    The bankruptcy court continued: “So based\n25   upon the exemption claim, there is no basis to disallow that\n26   claim of exemption and the moving party cannot cite me to any\n27   legal authority that supports its interpretation of the limits\n28   as asserted.”   Hr’g Tr. 11:3–6.\n\n                                        4\n\f 1        The bankruptcy court then entered an order overruling the\n 2   objection.   Appellants timely appealed.\n 3                               JURISDICTION\n 4        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n 5   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(B).    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n 6   § 158.\n 7                                  ISSUE\n 8        Whether the bankruptcy court erred in overruling\n 9   Appellants’ objection and upholding Debtor’s claimed exemption\n10   in the SSI Account.\n11                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n12        We review de novo a debtor’s right to claim an exemption.\n13   Elliot v. Weil (In re Elliot), 544 B.R. 421, 430 (9th Cir. BAP\n14   2016).   We review the bankruptcy court’s factual findings for\n15   clear error.   Id.   A factual finding is clearly erroneous if\n16   illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that\n17   may be drawn from the facts in the record.    See\n18   TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820, 832\n19   (9th Cir. 2011) (citing United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247,\n20   1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)).     And we may affirm on any basis\n21   in the record.   Bill v. Brewer, 799 F.3d 1295, 1299 (9th Cir.\n22   2015).\n23                                DISCUSSION\n24        On appeal, the parties repeat the arguments they raised\n25   below, and there is no factual dispute on the key point: they\n26   agree that the SSI Account contains exclusively social security\n27   proceeds received before Debtor filed bankruptcy.    We adopt the\n28   undisputed facts as agreed to by the parties, and we affirm but\n\n                                      5\n\f 1   not for the reasons stated by the bankruptcy court.\n 2        A.   The Social Security proceeds never entered the\n               bankruptcy estate.\n 3\n 4        A debtor is required to list all of her property in her\n 5   schedules.   Hamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 270 F.3d\n 6   778, 785 (9th Cir. 2001) (“The Bankruptcy Code and Rules impose\n 7   upon the bankruptcy debtors an express, affirmative duty to\n 8   disclose all assets . . . .” (internal quotation marks\n 9   omitted)).   And generally, “[w]hen a debtor files a Chapter 7\n10   bankruptcy petition, all of the debtor’s assets become property\n11   of the bankruptcy estate, see 11 U.S.C. § 541, subject to the\n12   debtor’s right to reclaim certain property as ‘exempt,’\n13   § 522(l).”   Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U.S. 770, 774 (2010).\n14        In some cases, however, an asset — while listed on a\n15   debtor’s schedules — never becomes an estate asset.       And here,\n16   while the Debtor does little to advance or develop the point,\n17   she argues that 42 U.S.C. § 407 protects the SSI Account from\n18   inclusion in her bankruptcy estate.       In her appellate brief,\n19   Debtor quotes the relevant language in 42 U.S.C. § 407(a).           And\n20   at the hearing before the bankruptcy court, her counsel\n21   generally argued that the statute “takes Social Security off the\n22   table, period.”   Hr’g Tr. 7:13-14.      Appellants respond but fail\n23   to squarely confront the issue.       Neither party cites the\n24   extensive and compelling case law discussing the topic.         In\n25   resolving this issue, we follow the Eighth Circuit, its BAP, and\n26   numerous other persuasive authorities.\n27        We hold that 42 U.S.C. § 407 “operates as a complete bar to\n28   the forced inclusion of past and future social security proceeds\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   in the bankruptcy estate.”   Carpenter v. Ries (In re Carpenter)\n 2   (“Carpenter III”), 614 F.3d 930, 936 (8th Cir. 2010).    We, thus,\n 3   agree that this federal statute creates an exception to\n 4   the general rule of § 541 and operates as a bar to the forced\n 5   inclusion of social security proceeds, and thus the SSI Account,\n 6   in the bankruptcy estate.\n 7        We start with the relevant statutory texts.    Section 541\n 8   provides that the bankruptcy estate is comprised of “all legal\n 9   or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the\n10   commencement of the case.”   11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1).   But\n11   42 U.S.C. § 407 provides, as relevant here:\n12        (a) The right of any person to any future payment\n          under this subchapter shall not be transferable or\n13        assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the\n          moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this\n14        subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy,\n          attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to\n15        the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\n16        (b) No other provision of law, enacted before, on, or\n          after April 20, 1983, may be construed to limit,\n17        supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this\n          section except to the extent that it does so by\n18        express reference to this section.\n19   42 U.S.C. § 407 (emphasis added).\n20        These statutes conflict; and “courts have struggled to\n21   determine when social security proceeds should be included in a\n22   debtor’s bankruptcy estate.”   Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 934\n23   (citing cases).\n24        The Sixth Circuit determined that the Bankruptcy Reform Act\n25   of 1978 did not impliedly repeal 42 U.S.C. § 407.     Hildebrand v.\n26   Soc. Sec. Admin. (In re Buren), 725 F.2d 1080, 1081 (6th Cir.\n27   1984).   Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the\n28   bankruptcy court could not order the government to send social\n\n                                     7\n\f 1   security benefits directly to a chapter 13 trustee.       Id.\n 2   at 1087.   The Eighth Circuit, in accord with the Eighth Circuit\n 3   BAP, came to a similar conclusion in the chapter 7 context; it\n 4   affirmed the BAP’s determination that a chapter 7 debtor’s\n 5   social security proceeds “must be excluded from the bankruptcy\n 6   estate pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 407 and may be retained by the\n 7   debtor.”   Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 933.3\n 8        We agree.    Section 407 of Title 42 is unqualified: “It\n 9   explicitly demands that no past or future social security\n10   payments may be subject to the operation of any bankruptcy law.”\n11   Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 936.       Further, 42 U.S.C. § 407(b)\n12   provides that only laws expressly referring to it may limit its\n13   application.     And, as the Eighth Circuit BAP explained, “no\n14   provision in the Bankruptcy Code makes express reference to\n15\n16\n          3\n             We do not find the Eleventh Circuit’s Walker v.\n17   Treadwell (In re Treadwell), 699 F.2d 1050 (11th Cir. 1983),\n18   decision compelling. Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 935; Carpenter\n     v. Ries (In re Carpenter) (“Carpenter II”), 408 B.R. 244, 248-49\n19   (8th Cir. BAP 2009) (distinguishing Treadwell on the facts);\n     In re Radford, 265 B.R. 827, 830 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 2000). Even\n20   if we did find Treadwell persuasive, it would not apply to this\n21   case. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that 42 U.S.C. § 407 was\n     essentially an exemption:\n22\n          This analysis of section 522 illustrates that the\n23        exemption from the operation of the bankruptcy law\n24        provided by 42 U.S.C.A. § 407 is not absolute. If a\n          debtor chooses the Bankruptcy Code exemptions, he\n25        gives up the protection of section 407, freeing\n          accumulated social security benefits for the\n26        satisfaction of creditors.\n27\n     In re Treadwell, 699 F.2d at 1052.       California debtors may not\n28   claim the federal exemptions.\n\n                                       8\n\f 1   [42 U.S.C.] § 407 . . . .”     Carpenter II, 408 B.R. at 248.   See\n 2   also 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 522.09[10][a] n.76 (Alan N.\n 3   Resnick & Henry J. Sommer, eds., 16th ed. 2010) (“Congress\n 4   amended 42 U.S.C. § 407 to clarify that the inalienability of\n 5   Social Security benefits was not repealed by the Bankruptcy\n 6   Code, so that such benefits should not even become part of the\n 7   bankruptcy estate.    Social Security benefits are protected by\n 8   42 U.S.C. § 407 even after they have been received and placed in\n 9   a bank account.” (citation omitted)).\n10        Appellants contend that Debtor waived her ability to claim\n11   a 42 U.S.C. § 407 exemption because she did not assert it in her\n12   schedules.   We disagree.    If 42 U.S.C. § 407 applies, as we hold\n13   it does, then the social security benefits are excluded from and\n14   never enter the estate.     A debtor claims exemptions in estate\n15   property.    Debtor, thus, did not need to assert a “42 U.S.C.\n16   § 407 exemption” in the SSI Account.     See In re Franklin,\n17   506 B.R. 765, 776 (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 2014) (“It follows that\n18   since a debtor's right to receive future social security\n19   benefits and proceeds traceable to benefits already paid do not\n20   become property of the bankruptcy estate, there is no need to\n21   claim them as exempt, as the exemption process applies only to\n22   property of the estate.”).     42 U.S.C. § 407 creates an exclusion\n23   — not an exemption.\n24        Appellants’ reliance on In re Varney, 449 B.R. 411 (Bankr.\n25   D. Idaho 2011) (Pappas, J), is not persuasive; the case is\n26   legally and factually distinguishable.\n27        First, although Varney discusses social security disability\n28   benefits, it does not consider the effect of 42 U.S.C. § 407.\n\n                                       9\n\f 1   Cf. In re Welsh, 465 B.R. 843, 859–60 (9th Cir. BAP 2012)\n 2   (Pappas, J., dissenting) (“That 42 U.S.C. § 407(a) may place\n 3   Social Security benefits out of the reach of, for example, a\n 4   hungry chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee trying to assemble funds to\n 5   distribute to creditors is no justification to disregard the\n 6   existence of such income in judging a debtor’s good faith in\n 7   proposing a particular plan under chapter 13.”).    Its emphasis\n 8   on the need for disclosure and claim of exemption in even\n 9   “unquestionably exempt” estate assets does not aid Appellants\n10   where the SSI Account was not an estate asset.\n11        Second, factually, it involved a debtor who failed to\n12   schedule or exempt an interest in the social security benefits\n13   until after the chapter 7 trustee brought a turnover motion.\n14   449 B.R. at 415.   Here, Debtor disclosed the SSI Account at case\n15   initiation.   Debtor was required to schedule the SSI Account; it\n16   was her asset even if not an asset of the estate.\n17   In re Franklin, 506 B.R. at 776 (“[N]otwithstanding the\n18   exclusionary effect of § 407, debtors are still required to\n19   disclose social security proceeds and their right to receive\n20   future benefits in their schedule of personal property.    The\n21   disclosure requirement, by itself, does not subject such\n22   benefits to the operation of the bankruptcy laws.” (citation\n23   omitted)).\n24        Appellants also argue that the funds lost their status as\n25   social security payments when Debtor deposited them into an\n26   account jointly in the name of her son.   Debtor counters that\n27   they waived this argument on appeal by failing to raise it\n28   before the bankruptcy court.   Appellants do not say that they\n\n                                     10\n\f 1   raised it below (they did not), but they contend that we may\n 2   consider a pure question of law and that Debtor does not dispute\n 3   that the account is a joint account.4    They further suggest that\n 4   we may consider it in connection with Debtor’s 42 U.S.C. § 407\n 5   argument.    We disagree.   Central to the bankruptcy court’s\n 6   decision was a finding that the funds in the account were social\n 7   security benefits: “I have evidence from the debtor in response\n 8   to the motion that she has segregated her Social Security\n 9   benefits and that everything in that account is only Social\n10   Security benefits.”    Hr’g Tr. 10:24-11:2.   Appellants’ “purely\n11   legal” point could thus undercut the bankruptcy court’s factual\n12   findings.5   We thus decline to consider the argument because it\n13   was raised for the first time on appeal.      See Kaass Law v. Wells\n14   Fargo Bank, N.A., 799 F.3d 1290, 1293 (9th Cir. 2015).\n15        Given the above, the social security proceeds never became\n16   estate property; Debtor did not need to exempt them; and,\n17\n          4\n18           By a separate motion submitted simultaneously with their\n     reply, Appellants ask us to take judicial notice of Debtor’s\n19   son’s bankruptcy petition. We grant the motion and take\n     judicial notice of the filing of the petition, but not the truth\n20\n     of any facts asserted in it. Cf. Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d\n21   668, 690 (9th Cir. 2001).\n          5\n22           In Carpenter II, the Eighth Circuit BAP discussed when\n     social security benefits lose the protection of 42 U.S.C.\n23   § 407(a). 408 B.R. at 247–49 (considering Philpott v. Essex\n24   County Welfare Board, 409 U.S. 413 (1973), and In re Treadwell).\n     Here, the proceeds are in cash form and still available to\n25   Debtor. If Appellants believe Debtor’s son has rights to the\n     SSI Account, they may raise the matter in his bankruptcy case.\n26   See id. at 249 (“It only makes sense that when the recipient of\n27   social security benefits chooses to give away or spend those\n     funds, such funds lose the protection of § 407 in the hands of\n28   the person to whom they are paid.”).\n\n                                       11\n\f 1   correspondingly, Appellants’ objection to Debtor’s exemption had\n 2   no legal import.    The bankruptcy court thus reached the proper\n 3   result in overruling Appellants’ exemption objection.\n 4        B.   Any error in the bankruptcy court’s decision was\n               harmless.\n 5\n 6        Although we do not reach them, we acknowledge two\n 7   intertwined issues that go to the propriety of the bankruptcy\n 8   court’s decision on the merits.    First, Appellants’ contention\n 9   that CCP § 703.140(b)(10)(A) does not exempt proceeds traceable\n10   to social security payments is apt.    We find persuasive their\n11   argument regarding the contrast of its language (exempting the\n12   “right to receive”) with the language of CCP § 703.140(b)(11)\n13   (exempting the debtor’s “right to receive, or property that is\n14   traceable to”).    The difference in the statutory language\n15   suggests that one exemption applies only to present or future\n16   income while another includes an asset traceable to the proceeds\n17   of prior distributions.    We acknowledge that California law is\n18   silent on this point, but we are aided by cases analyzing the\n19   identical language in the federal exemptions.    See Carpenter II,\n20   408 B.R. at 249; In re Panza, 219 B.R. 95, 98 (Bankr. W.D. Pa.\n21   1998); In re Williams, 181 B.R. 298, 301 (Bankr. W.D. Mich.\n22   1995) (“It appears that Congress intended not to exempt\n23   traceable assets under § 522(d)(10) because it did not\n24   explicitly do so.    The fact that such language is contained in\n25   § 522(d)(11) underscores that Congress knew how to include\n26   traceable assets in § 522(d)(10) had it desired to do so.”);\n27   In re Treadwell, 699 F.2d at 1052.     The California legislature\n28   also knew how to make clear that traceable assets are included\n\n                                       12\n\f 1   as exempt; it did so in CCP § 703.140(b)(11), but it did not do\n 2   so in CCP § 703.140(b)(10).   That said, we need not and do not\n 3   definitively decide this matter.\n 4         Second and on the other hand, if we are incorrect in our\n 5   determination that exemption of the SSI Account was unnecessary\n 6   because it was not an asset of the estate but are correct that\n 7   the bankruptcy court misapplied CCP § 703.140(b)(10), the\n 8   bankruptcy court’s overruling Appellants’ exemption objection\n 9   could be harmless error because the objection in the SSI Account\n10   appears to be untimely.\n11        Rule 4003 both directs debtors to list their § 522\n12   exemptions on their schedules and outlines claim objection\n13   procedures.   In order for an objection to an exemption to be\n14   timely, it must be filed within 30 days after the creditors’\n15   meeting held under § 341(a) is concluded or within 30 days after\n16   any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules is filed,\n17   whichever is later.   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b)(1).   Here, the\n18   § 341(a) meeting likely concluded on June 24, and Appellants\n19   filed their objection on July 27, 2016, 32 days later.    Debtor’s\n20   July 7, 2016 amendment did not restart the objection period as\n21   to the SSI Account because that claim of exemption was not\n22   modified.   Bernard v. Coyne (In re Bernard), 40 F.3d 1028, 1032\n23   (9th Cir. 1994) (new 30-day objection period runs “only with\n24   respect to the exemptions added via the amendment”).\n25        Unless a party in interest objects, a debtor’s claimed\n26   exemption “is exempt.”    11 U.S.C. § 522(l).   This has been\n27   referred to as an “exemption by default.”   Heintz v. Carey\n28   (In re Heintz), 198 B.R. 581, 583 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).    Thus,\n\n                                      13\n\f 1   through exemption, assets leave the estate and are no longer\n 2   subject to creditors’ claims.    Owen v. Owen, 500 U.S. 305, 308\n 3   (1991); 11 U.S.C. § 522(c).    Here, the timing of the objection\n 4   to exemption may have the same impact as our determination under\n 5   42 U.S.C. § 407; at the time of objection, the SSI Account was\n 6   not an estate asset.\n 7        At oral argument, Debtor’s counsel stated that they saw the\n 8   timeliness issue but decided not to raise it; nor did they raise\n 9   it in their appellate briefs.    Given our decision above, we need\n10   not decide whether § 522(l) and Rule 4003(b) limit our ability\n11   to review the merits of an untimely exemption objection even\n12   when the debtor fails to raise timeliness.\n13                                 CONCLUSION\n14        Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM.\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                       14\n\f",

After filing a voluntary chapter 11 petition, Debtor\n 7   claimed the full amount in that bank account as exempt.         The\n 8   bankruptcy court overruled Appellants’ objection to the\n 9   exemption based on its interpretation of California law.         We\n10   disagree with the bankruptcy court’s rationale, but we agree\n11   that the objection lacks merit.       As a result, we AFFIRM.\n12                                   FACTS\n13        Debtor filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition.       On\n14   Schedule A/B, she listed $30,000 in a Chase Bank deposit account\n15   (the “SSI Account”).    On Schedule C, she claimed the full amount\n16   in the SSI Account as exempt under California Code of Civil\n17   Procedure (“CCP”) § 703.140(b)(10)(A).\n18        Debtor’s § 341(a) creditors’ meeting was continued until\n19   June 24, 2016, and a review of the entire docket indicates that\n20   it concluded on that date.2    Debtor later, on July 7, 2016,\n21\n22        **\n             The Hon. Fredrick E. Clement, United States Bankruptcy\n23   Judge for the Eastern District of California, sitting by\n     designation.\n24\n          1\n             Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n25   references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532.\n     All “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n26\n     Procedure.\n27        2\n               We exercise our discretion to take judicial notice of\n28                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                       2\n\f 1   amended her Schedule C, but she did not amend her claim of\n 2   exemption in the SSI Account in any respect.\n 3        On July 26, 2016, Appellants objected to four of Debtor’s\n 4   claimed exemptions, including, as relevant here, her exemption\n 5   of the SSI Account.   They argued that CCP § 703.140(b)(10)(A)\n 6   did not apply because it exempted only the future right to\n 7   receive payments and did not exempt payments already received.\n 8        Debtor, naturally, opposed.      First, she argued that nothing\n 9   in CCP § 703.140(b)(10)(A) “limits its protection to the right\n10   to receive future social security payments.     A debtor can exempt\n11   money already received as a social security benefit.”     Second,\n12   she contended that she established the SSI Account specifically\n13   for use with her social security income, explained that she\n14   deposited her social security income into the SSI Account, and\n15   argued that on the petition date the money in the SSI Account,\n16   therefore, was exempt.\n17        In reply, Appellants augmented their original argument with\n18   the observation that, if the California legislature had intended\n19   to exempt more than future social security income, it would have\n20   included language similar to that found in CCP § 703.140(b)(11).\n21   That statute provides an exemption not only for the “debtor’s\n22   right to receive [certain payments]” but also for “property that\n23   is traceable to [the payment]”.\n24        At the hearing on the exemption objections, Debtor’s\n25\n26        2\n           (...continued)\n27   documents electronically filed in the underlying bankruptcy\n     case.

He started: “First off,\n 3   counsel is correct with the – with respect to the Social\n 4   Security and there is a different statute that protects\n 5   prepetition paid Social Security.      It’s 42 U.S.C.\n 6   Section 407(a).   And so there’s a simple solution to dealing\n 7   with that.   I can simply amend Schedule C to apply that . . . .”\n 8   Hr’g Tr. 5:14-19.   The bankruptcy court clarified: “Are you now\n 9   abandoning the argument that 703.140(b)(10)([A]) does not\n10   include Social Security benefits that have been paid?”      Hr’g Tr.\n11   7:5-7.   “No,” started Debtor’s counsel, but the bankruptcy court\n12   interjected: “You’re just saying there’s also a federal\n13   exemption, though?”    Hr’g Tr. 7:8-10.    Debtor’s counsel agreed:\n14   “Exactly.”   Hr’g Tr. 7:11.\n15        After further argument, the bankruptcy court ruled on other\n16   exemptions not relevant to this appeal and then turned to the\n17   SSI Account objection:\n18        As to the objection as to the Social Security\n          benefits, again, there’s nothing in the statute that\n19        limits it to benefits -- Social Security benefits that\n          are to be provided or to be received, as opposed to\n20        Social Security benefits that have been received, as\n          well as those coming in the future. I have evidence\n21        from the debtor in response to the motion that she has\n          segregated her Social Security benefits and that\n22        everything in that account is only Social Security\n          benefits.\n23\n24   Hr’g Tr. 10:19–11:2.    The bankruptcy court continued: “So based\n25   upon the exemption claim, there is no basis to disallow that\n26   claim of exemption and the moving party cannot cite me to any\n27   legal authority that supports its interpretation of the limits\n28   as asserted.”   Hr’g Tr. 11:3–6.\n\n                                        4\n\f 1        The bankruptcy court then entered an order overruling the\n 2   objection.

And here,\n16   while the Debtor does little to advance or develop the point,\n17   she argues that 42 U.S.C. § 407 protects the SSI Account from\n18   inclusion in her bankruptcy estate.       In her appellate brief,\n19   Debtor quotes the relevant language in 42 U.S.C. § 407(a).           And\n20   at the hearing before the bankruptcy court, her counsel\n21   generally argued that the statute “takes Social Security off the\n22   table, period.”   Hr’g Tr. 7:13-14.      Appellants respond but fail\n23   to squarely confront the issue.       Neither party cites the\n24   extensive and compelling case law discussing the topic.         In\n25   resolving this issue, we follow the Eighth Circuit, its BAP, and\n26   numerous other persuasive authorities.\n27        We hold that 42 U.S.C. § 407 “operates as a complete bar to\n28   the forced inclusion of past and future social security proceeds\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   in the bankruptcy estate.”   Carpenter v.

We, thus,\n 3   agree that this federal statute creates an exception to\n 4   the general rule of § 541 and operates as a bar to the forced\n 5   inclusion of social security proceeds, and thus the SSI Account,\n 6   in the bankruptcy estate.\n 7        We start with the relevant statutory texts.    Section 541\n 8   provides that the bankruptcy estate is comprised of “all legal\n 9   or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the\n10   commencement of the case.”   11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1).   But\n11   42 U.S.C. § 407 provides, as relevant here:\n12        (a) The right of any person to any future payment\n          under this subchapter shall not be transferable or\n13        assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the\n          moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this\n14        subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy,\n          attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to\n15        the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\n16        (b) No other provision of law, enacted before, on, or\n          after April 20, 1983, may be construed to limit,\n17        supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this\n          section except to the extent that it does so by\n18        express reference to this section.\n19   42 U.S.C. § 407 (emphasis added).\n20        These statutes conflict; and “courts have struggled to\n21   determine when social security proceeds should be included in a\n22   debtor’s bankruptcy estate.”   Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 934\n23   (citing cases).\n24        The Sixth Circuit determined that the Bankruptcy Reform Act\n25   of 1978 did not impliedly repeal 42 U.S.C. § 407.

Id.\n 2   at 1087.   The Eighth Circuit, in accord with the Eighth Circuit\n 3   BAP, came to a similar conclusion in the chapter 7 context; it\n 4   affirmed the BAP’s determination that a chapter 7 debtor’s\n 5   social security proceeds “must be excluded from the bankruptcy\n 6   estate pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 407 and may be retained by the\n 7   debtor.”   Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 933.3\n 8        We agree.    Section 407 of Title 42 is unqualified: “It\n 9   explicitly demands that no past or future social security\n10   payments may be subject to the operation of any bankruptcy law.”\n11   Carpenter III, 614 F.3d at 936.       Further, 42 U.S.C. § 407(b)\n12   provides that only laws expressly referring to it may limit its\n13   application.     And, as the Eighth Circuit BAP explained, “no\n14   provision in the Bankruptcy Code makes express reference to\n15\n16\n          3\n             We do not find the Eleventh Circuit’s Walker v.\n17   Treadwell (In re Treadwell), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414216\"><a href=\"/opinion/414216/in-the-matter-of-roger-burnett-treadwell-debtor-james-d-walker-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1983),\n18   decision compelling.

If a\n          debtor chooses the Bankruptcy Code exemptions, he\n25        gives up the protection of section 407, freeing\n          accumulated social security benefits for the\n26        satisfaction of creditors.\n27\n     In re Treadwell, 699 F.2d at 1052.

We disagree.    If 42 U.S.C. § 407 applies, as we hold\n13   it does, then the social security benefits are excluded from and\n14   never enter the estate.     A debtor claims exemptions in estate\n15   property.    Debtor, thus, did not need to assert a “42 U.S.C.\n16   § 407 exemption” in the SSI Account.

Its emphasis\n 8   on the need for disclosure and claim of exemption in even\n 9   “unquestionably exempt” estate assets does not aid Appellants\n10   where the SSI Account was not an estate asset.\n11        Second, factually, it involved a debtor who failed to\n12   schedule or exempt an interest in the social security benefits\n13   until after the chapter 7 trustee brought a turnover motion.\n14   449 B.R. at 415.   Here, Debtor disclosed the SSI Account at case\n15   initiation.   Debtor was required to schedule the SSI Account; it\n16   was her asset even if not an asset of the estate.\n17   In re Franklin, 506 B.R. at 776 (“[N]otwithstanding the\n18   exclusionary effect of § 407, debtors are still required to\n19   disclose social security proceeds and their right to receive\n20   future benefits in their schedule of personal property.

Debtor counters that\n27   they waived this argument on appeal by failing to raise it\n28   before the bankruptcy court.   Appellants do not say that they\n\n                                     10\n\f 1   raised it below (they did not), but they contend that we may\n 2   consider a pure question of law and that Debtor does not dispute\n 3   that the account is a joint account.4    They further suggest that\n 4   we may consider it in connection with Debtor’s 42 U.S.C. § 407\n 5   argument.    We disagree.   Central to the bankruptcy court’s\n 6   decision was a finding that the funds in the account were social\n 7   security benefits: “I have evidence from the debtor in response\n 8   to the motion that she has segregated her Social Security\n 9   benefits and that everything in that account is only Social\n10   Security benefits.”    Hr’g Tr. 10:24-11:2.   Appellants’ “purely\n11   legal” point could thus undercut the bankruptcy court’s factual\n12   findings.5   We thus decline to consider the argument because it\n13   was raised for the first time on appeal.

The bankruptcy court thus reached the proper\n 3   result in overruling Appellants’ exemption objection.\n 4        B.   Any error in the bankruptcy court’s decision was\n               harmless.\n 5\n 6        Although we do not reach them, we acknowledge two\n 7   intertwined issues that go to the propriety of the bankruptcy\n 8   court’s decision on the merits.    First, Appellants’ contention\n 9   that CCP § 703.140(b)(10)(A) does not exempt proceeds traceable\n10   to social security payments is apt.    We find persuasive their\n11   argument regarding the contrast of its language (exempting the\n12   “right to receive”) with the language of CCP § 703.140(b)(11)\n13   (exempting the debtor’s “right to receive, or property that is\n14   traceable to”).    The difference in the statutory language\n15   suggests that one exemption applies only to present or future\n16   income while another includes an asset traceable to the proceeds\n17   of prior distributions.    We acknowledge that California law is\n18   silent on this point, but we are aided by cases analyzing the\n19   identical language in the federal exemptions.

Given our decision above, we need\n10   not decide whether § 522(l) and Rule 4003(b) limit our ability\n11   to review the merits of an untimely exemption objection even\n12   when the debtor fails to raise timeliness.\n13                                 CONCLUSION\n14        Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM.\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                       14\n\f</pre>",
