(CR 1:7-22,35-37).\n\nCourse of Proceedings: On or about March 28, 2013, Teresa registered the parties’\n                       1987 New Mexico divorce decree in Texas. (CR 1:7-22).\n                       On April 4, 2013, Teresa provided notice to Paul of the\n                       registration of a foreign decree. (CR 1:23-24). On or\n                       about April 22, 2013, Paul filed a response in which he\n                       contested such registration, asserted various affirmative\n                       defenses, and requested a hearing. (CR 1:25-26). On or\n                       about April 3, 2014, Teresa filed a Motion for Enforcement\n                       of Order seeking to enforce a specific provision of the\n                       parties’ divorce decree pertaining to the division of Paul’s\n                       retirement pension. (CR 1:35-37).\n\n                         A bench trial was held on July 22, 2014. (RR 1: 1). At the\n                         conclusion of the bench trial, the trial court took the matter\n                         under consideration. (RR 2:30). On or about August 20,\n                         2014, the trial court issued a letter ruling, and on\n                         September 15, 2014, the trial court entered a written\n                         judgment denying all of Paul’s affirmative defenses,\n                         granting Teresa’s request to enforce the specific property\n                         provision pertaining to Paul’s retirement benefits, and\n                         awarding Teresa a total money judgment of $51,635.60.\n                         (CR 1:41,44-45) (Appendix 1).\n\n                         On or about October 3, 2014, Paul timely requested that the\n                         trial court enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n                         (CR 1:51-52). On or about October 22, 2014, the trial\n                         court entered its written findings and conclusions. (CR\n                         1:52-53) (Appendix 2). On or about December 12, 2014,\n                         Paul timely filed his Notice of Appeal. (CR 1:57-58).\n\n\n\n\n                                         xi\n\fTrial Court:             The Honorable Ben Woodward, 119th Judicial District\n                         Court, Tom Green County, Texas.\n\nTrial Court Disposition: Judgment dated September 15, 2014. (CR 1:44-45)\n                         (Appendix 1). The trial court’s judgment awarded Teresa\n                         $48,757.60 in actual damages, $278.00 in court costs, and\n                         $2,600.00 in attorney’s fees. (Id.).\n\nParties:                 Petitioner/Appellee:  Teresa A. Simmons\n                         Respondent/Appellant: Paul D. Simmons\n\n\n\n\n                                       xii\n\f                     Issue Presented\n\nIssue No. 1:   Teresa’s enforcement action was subject to the applicable\n               statute of limitations. Paul properly raised this defense in\n               his pleadings and during the bench trial. Did the trial court\n               abuse its discretion by enforcing the parties’ 1987 divorce\n               decree and awarding Teresa $51,635.60 when her\n               enforcement action was barred by this affirmative defense?\n\n\n\n\n                              xiii\n\f                              Statement of Facts\n\nM     The Parties’ Marital History.\n\n      Paul and Teresa were married on August 22, 1969. (RR 2:16). They were both\n\nnineteen years old when they got married. (RR 3:PX#5). During the course of their\n\nmarriage, they had two children–a son and a daughter. (RR 2:18; 3:PX#5). After\n\nbeing married for approximately eighteen years, the couple decided to get divorced.\n\n(RR 2:16).\n\n      Paul and Teresa’s divorce was final on June 1, 1987, and a written Decree of\n\nDissolution of Marriage, (the “Divorce Decree”), was entered on that same day in\n\nEddy County, New Mexico. (CR 1:8-10; RR 2:16; 3:PX#4; FF#1) (Appendices 2-3).\n\nAt the time of the parties’ divorce, their son was approximately fourteen or fifteen\n\nyears old and their daughter was approximately nine or ten years old. (RR 2:18).\n\nM     The Parties’ Settlement Agreement.\n\n      Paul and Teresa resolved all issues pertaining to their divorce through the\n\nexecution of a Child Custody, Support and Property Settlement Agreement, (the\n\n“Settlement Agreement”). (CR 1:11-21; RR 2:16-17; 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). The\n\nSettlement Agreement was approved by the New Mexico trial court and properly\n\nincorporated into the Divorce Decree. (CR 1:8-10; RR 3:PX#4) (Appendix 3). Under\n\nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paul retained primary custody of the two\n\n                                         1\n\fchildren during the school year, and Teresa had custody of the children during their\n\nsummer vacation. (CR 1:12; RR 2:18; 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3).\n\n      As to child support, Paul agreed to pay Teresa $100.00 per month for every\n\nthirty days she had physical custody of the children. (CR 1:13; RR 3:PX#5)\n\n(Appendix 3). The parties also agreed that Teresa would not be required to pay any\n\nchild support while she attended law school. (Id.). Additionally, the parties agreed\n\nthat the New Mexico trial court would retain jurisdiction to modify the custody or\n\nchild support provisions included in the Settlement Agreement once Teresa graduated\n\nfrom law school. (Id.).\n\n      It appears the parties never petitioned the trial court to modify these custody\n\nor child support provisions. Paul testified Teresa never paid him any child support\n\nand that he had provided the total support for the two children. (RR 2:11). In\n\ncontrast, Teresa testified that their daughter came to live with her at around the age\n\nof fifteen years. (RR 2:20). She further testified that during the time the child was\n\nliving with her, Paul maintained insurance on their daughter but provided no other\n\nfinancial support for the child during this time period. (Id.). It was undisputed that\n\nby the day of trial, both of the children were over twenty-one years of age. (RR 2:11).\n\n      Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paul was also required to pay\n\n$100.00 each month towards Teresa’s credit card purchases for gas and automobile\n\n\n                                          2\n\fmaintenance for a period of eighteen months, that is, until December 31, 1988. (Id.).\n\n      Regarding the division of the parties’ property, Teresa testified that the only\n\nproperty she actually got out of the divorce was a car, her clothing, jewelry, and some\n\npatio furniture. (RR 2:19). Teresa testified that she basically “left” Paul all the\n\nproperty, including her “grandmother’s dishes.” (Id.). Her trial testimony in this\n\nregard was misleading, if not entirely false.\n\n      A careful review of the terms of the Settlement Agreement reveals Teresa was\n\nawarded a substantial amount of the parties’ community property, including but not\n\nlimited to, the following: two cars, jewelry, a computer, two beds, two desks, a\n\nstereo, two guns, lamps, a dining table and four chairs, a TV, a microwave, and patio\n\nfurniture. (CR 1:14; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). Additionally, under the terms of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Teresa was specifically awarded her grandmother’s dishes.\n\n(Id.). Teresa was also awarded $9,000.00 which constituted cash monies advanced\n\nfor her school expenses and proceeds from her teacher retirement benefits. (Id.).\n\n      Undisputedly, the parties owned a home at the time of their divorce. (RR\n\n1:19). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Teresa was awarded no equity\n\nin this home. (CR 1:14,16; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). However, it was also\n\nundisputed that under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paul became solely\n\nresponsible for payment of the $82,200.00 mortgage that was attached to the parties’\n\n\n                                          3\n\fhome, along with approximately $35,000.00 in miscellaneous debt that the parties had\n\nincurred as of the date of their divorce. (CR 1:16-17; RR 3:PX#5). In contrast,\n\npursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Teresa did not assume\n\nresponsibility for payment of any of the $117,000.00 community property debt that\n\nthe parties had accumulated during their eighteen year long marriage. (Id.).\n\n      Teresa testified that she left the majority of the furniture in the house because\n\nshe did not want “the kids to just feel turned upside-down by everything.” (RR 2:19).\n\nTeresa’s choice not to take possession of the property she was awarded under the\n\nDivorce Decree for the sake of her children is a far cry from her representation that\n\nshe “left” Paul basically all the property in the divorce. Rather, the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial reveals the final property division in the parties’ 1987 divorce was\n\nmore than fair to Teresa.\n\nM     The Division of Paul’s Retirement Benefits.\n\n      It was also undisputed at trial that under the terms of the Settlement\n\nAgreement, Teresa was awarded a portion of Paul’s retirement benefits. (CR 1:14;\n\nRR 2:17; 3:PX#5; FF#1) (Appendices 2-3). Specifically, this provision of the\n\nSettlement Agreement reads as follows:\n\n      (6) Division of Community Property. The parties community\n      property shall be divided as follows:\n\n      A.     Wife shall have set over to her as her sole and separate property:\n\n                                              4\n\f                          ...\n\n             23. A portion of Husband’s retirement, pension, thrift, profit\n      sharing and other employee benefits acquired through Husband’s\n      employment with Conoco, to be paid if, as, and when received by\n      Husband. Wife’s portion shall be one-half times a fraction (the\n      numerator of which shall be the number of years the parties were\n      married during Husband’s employment with Conoco and the\n      denominator of which shall be the number of years Husband or his\n      employer, or both, contributed to the plan or benefit) times the amount\n      of the benefit received by Husband.\n\n(CR 1:14; RR 3:PX#5; FF#1) (Appendices 2-3). There was no evidence introduced\n\nat trial that a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, (“QDRO”), to this effect was ever\n\nentered by any trial court or that Conoco was ever placed on notice of this particular\n\nprovision of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nM     Conoco’s Payment of Paul’s Retirement Benefits.\n\n      Paul testified he began working for Conoco on February 12, 1979. (RR 1:6;\n\nFF#2) (Appendix 2). Over the next twenty-six years, Paul continued his employment\n\nwith Conoco. (RR 1:8). Paul testified that on March 26, 2004, his employment with\n\nConoco ended. (RR 1:8; FF#2) (Appendix 2).\n\n      Paul also testified that on November 1, 2004, he cashed out his retirement\n\nbenefits from Conoco. (RR 1:7). A copy of a check dated November 1, 2004, from\n\nArvest Trust Company, NA, the paying agent for ConocoPhillips Retirement\n\nBenefits, was introduced into evidence at trial and reflected that Paul received\n\n\n                                          5\n\f$295,500.61 in retirement benefits from Conoco. (RR 2:8; 3:PX#2; FF#3) (Appendix\n\n2).\n\n       Paul testified he used the money to pay off a “bunch of bills and debt and\n\neverything else.”1 (RR 2:8). He further testified that as of the day of trial, these cash\n\nmonies were “gone” and he did not have them any more. (Id.). It was undisputed at\n\ntrial that Paul did not forward Teresa her share of the money he received when he\n\ncashed out his retirement benefits with Conoco. (Id.).\n\nM      Teresa’s Enforcement Action.\n\n       Approximately twenty-six years after the parties finalized their divorce, and\n\napproximately eight and a half years after Paul cashed in his retirement benefits with\n\nConoco, Teresa filed a Petition for Enforcement of Order, (“Petition for\n\nEnforcement”), seeking to enforce the Divorce Decree. (CR 1:35-37; FF#10)\n\n(Appendix 2). Paul asserted various affirmative defenses to Teresa’s enforcement\n\naction, including but not limited to, the statute of limitations and laches. (CR 1:25-\n\n26; FF#9) (Appendix 2).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The trial court found that Paul had utilized some of the retirement benefits he received\non November 1, 2004, to pay off a mortgage on his home in August of 2012. (FF#5). (Appendix\n2). However, there was no evidence that Paul actually used these particular retirement benefits\nfor that purpose. Rather, Paul simply testified that he had paid off his home mortgage in 2012\nand did not identify the funds he utilized in paying this debt. (RR 2:13). Accordingly, the trial\ncourt’s finding of fact in this regard was incorrect.\n\n                                                6\n\f      A bench trial was held on July 22, 2014. (RR 1:14). Paul and Teresa were the\n\nonly two witnesses at the bench trial. (RR 2:5,15). At the conclusion of the bench\n\ntrial, the trial court took the matter under advisement. (RR 2:30).\n\n      On August 20, 2014—approximately twenty-seven years after the parties’\n\ndivorce was final—the trial court issued a letter ruling denying all of Paul’s\n\naffirmative defenses and awarding Teresa $48,757.60 in actual damages, $2,600.00\n\nin attorney’s fees, and costs of court. (CR 1:41; CL#6) (Appendix 2). On September\n\n15, 2014, the trial court entered a written judgment awarding Teresa a total sum of\n\n$51,635.60, with postjudgment interest accruing at the rate of six percent. (CR 1:44-\n\n45; CL#6) (Appendices 1-2). It is from this judgment that Paul now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                           Summary of the Argument\n\n      Teresa waited approximately twenty-six years to seek enforcement of the\n\nDivorce Decree’s provisions awarding her a portion of Paul’s retirement benefits.\n\nPaul properly asserted that the statue of limitations barred Teresa’s enforcement\n\naction. Teresa’s cause of action accrued on November 1, 2004 and was barred after\n\nNovember 1, 2006.\n\n      Teresa failed to specifically plead the applicability of the discovery rule prior\n\nto trial. She also failed to prove her injury in this case was inherently undiscoverable,\n\nnotwithstanding reasonable diligence. The trial court thus erred in concluding the\n\ndiscovery rule tolled the applicable two-year statute of limitations found in TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE § 9.003(b). Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in enforcing the\n\nprovision of the Divorce Decree in regards to the division of Paul’s retirement\n\nbenefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                               Standards of Review\n\nM     Findings of Fact.\n\n      A trial court’s findings of fact have the same force and dignity as a jury’s\n\nverdict. Anderson v. City of Seven Points, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794 (Tex. 1991). An\n\nappellate court reviews a trial court’s findings of fact under the same legal and factual\n\nsufficiency standard used to support a jury’s verdict. Id.    In an appeal from a bench\n\ntrial, an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence must be directed at specific findings\n\nof fact, rather than at the judgment as a whole. In the Interest of M.W., 959 S.W.2d\n\n661, 664 (Tex. App.–Tyler 1997, writ denied). “Generally, a finding of fact not\n\nchallenged in a point of error on appeal is binding on the appellate court.” Id.\n\n      !      Legal Sufficiency.\n\n      If a party challenges the legal sufficiency on an issue which he did not have the\n\nburden of proof, he must demonstrate on appeal that no evidence supports the adverse\n\nruling. Westech Eng’g, Inc. v. Clearwater Constructors, Inc., 835 S.W.2d 190, 196\n\n(Tex. App.–Austin 1992, no writ).          When findings are challenged for legal\n\nsufficiency, an appellate court should “view the evidence in a light that tends to\n\nsupport the finding of the disputed fact and disregard all evidence and inferences to\n\nthe contrary.” Sixth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Sibley, 111 S.W.3d 46, 52 (Tex. 2003).\n\nIn other words, an appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable\n\n                                           9\n\fto the challenged finding under a legal sufficiency review. Point Lookout West, Inc.\n\nv. Whorton, 742 S.W.2d 277, 279 (Tex. 1987).\n\n      A legal sufficiency challenge will be sustained when:\n\n      (1)    the record discloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital\n             fact;\n      (2)    the court is barred by rules of law or rules of evidence from\n             giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact;\n      (3)    the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere\n             scintilla; or\n      (4)    the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of a vital fact.\n\nUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328, 334 (Tex. 1998), cert.\n\ndenied, 526 U.S. 1040, 119 S.Ct. 1336, 143 L.Ed.2d 500 (1999). “If more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence exists to support the questioned finding, the ‘no evidence’ point\n\nfails.” Leibman v. Grand, 981 S.W.2d 426, 429 (Tex. App.-El Paso 1998, no pet.).\n\n      !      Factual Sufficiency.\n\n      When a party without the burden of proof challenges the factual sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence to support an adverse finding, the party must demonstrate that there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the adverse finding. Westech, 835 S.W.2d at 196.\n\nUnder a factual sufficiency review, an appellate considers both the evidence that\n\nsupports the finding and the evidence that is contrary to the finding. Plas-Tex., Inc.\n\nv. U.S. Steel Corp., 772 S.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex. 1989). “In reviewing a factual\n\nsufficiency point, the court of appeals must weigh all of the evidence in the record.”\n\n\n                                          10\n\fOrtiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996). Such evidence includes “both the\n\nevidence which tends to prove the existence of a vital fact as well as evidence which\n\ntends to disprove its existence.” Leibman, 981 S.W.2d at 429.\n\n         The finding should be sustained if there is some probative evidence to support\n\nit and provided it is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\nId.; Ortiz, 917 S.W.2d at 772. An appellate court should reverse the judgment and\n\norder a new trial if the trial court’s fact finding was so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d\n\n175, 176 (Tex. 1986). A finding which “shocks the conscience” or that is “manifestly\n\nunjust” will be overturned on appeal. Leibman, 981 S.W.2d at 429.\n\nM        Conclusions of Law.\n\n         Conclusions are reviewed de novo, and an appellate court is free to draw its\n\nown legal conclusions. City of Austin v. Whittington, 384 S.W.3d 766, 778 (Tex.\n\n2012). The legal conclusions of the trial court are therefore not binding upon an\n\nappellate court. Bates v. Tesar, 81 S.W.3d 441, 422 (Tex. App.–El Paso 2002, no\n\npet.).\n\n         The standard of review for legal conclusions is whether they are correct.\n\nHeritage Resources, Inc. v. Hill, 104 S.W.3d 612, 621 (Tex. App.–El Paso 2003, no\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fpet.). In other words, an appellate court independently evaluates conclusions of law\n\nto determine their correctness when they are attacked as a matter of law. Id.\n\n      An appellate court should follow a trial court’s conclusion of law unless it is\n\nerroneous as a matter of law. Hitzelberger v. Samedon Oil Corp., 948 S.W.2d 497,\n\n503 (Tex. App.-Waco 1997, writ denied).            If, however, the reviewing court\n\ndetermines that a conclusion of law is erroneous, but the trial court rendered the\n\nproper judgment, the erroneous conclusion of law does not require reversal. BMC\n\nSoftware Belgium, N.V. v. Marchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex. 2002).\n\nM     (Disputed) Trial Court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n      In the case at bar, Paul timely requested the trial court to enter findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law. (CR 1:50-51). In response to this request, the trial court\n\nentered written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on October 22, 2014. (CR\n\n1:52-53) (Appendix 2).      On appeal, the following factual findings and legal\n\nconclusions are specifically disputed:\n\n      !

Mayorga v. Mayorga, No. 03-13-00787-CV; 2015 TEX.\n\nAPP. LEXIS 4713, *11 (Tex. App.–Austin, May 8, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.); Murray\n\nv. Murray, 276 S.W.3d 128, 143 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 2008, pet. dism’d). The trial\n\ncourt abuses its discretion if it:\n\n       (1)    it acts in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner without reference\n              to any guiding rules or principles; or\n       (2)    erroneously exercises its power by making a choice outside the\n              range of choices permitted by law.\n\nCire v.

APP.\n\nLEXIS 4713 at *11; Murray, 276 S.W.3d at 143.\n\n       The mere fact that a trial judge may decide a matter within his discretionary\n\nauthority in a different manner than an appellate judge in a similar circumstance does\n                                           13\n\fnot demonstrate an abuse of discretion has occurred. Downer v. Aquamarine\n\nOperators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 242 (Tex. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106\n\nS. Ct. 2279, 90 L.Ed.2d 721 (1986). Thus, when reviewing matters committed to a\n\ntrial court’s discretion, an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that\n\nof the trial court. In re Am. Nat’l Cnty Mut. Ins. Co., 384 S.W.3d 429, 432 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Austin 2012, original proceeding).\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f                             Argument and Authorities\n\nIssue No. 1 Re-Stated: Teresa’s enforcement action was subject to the applicable\n                       statute of limitations. Paul properly raised this defense in\n                       his pleadings and during the bench trial. Did the trial court\n                       abuse its discretion by enforcing the parties’ 1987 divorce\n                       decree and awarding Teresa $51,635.60 when her\n                       enforcement action was barred by this affirmative defense?\n\nM      Two-Year Statute of Limitations: TEX. FAM. CODE § 9.003(b).\n\n       The trial court held that the two year statute of limitations found in Section\n\n9.003(b) of the TEXAS FAMILY CODE was applicable to the Petition for Enforcement.2\n\n(CR 1:41; CL#1) (Appendix 2). TEX. FAM. CODE § 9.003(b) reads as follows:\n\n       § 9.003. Filing Deadlines\n\n                      ...\n\n       (b)    A suit to enforce the division of future property not in existence\n              at the time of the original decree must be filed before the second\n              anniversary of the date the right to the property matures or\n              accrues or the decree becomes final, whichever date is later, or the\n              suit is barred.\n\nTEX. FAM.

(CR\n1:10; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). However, neither Paul nor Teresa argued to the trial court that\nthis enforcement action should governed by New Mexico law; therefore, the trial court applied\nTexas law in this case based on the consent of both parties. See Coca-Cola Co. v. Harmar\nBottling Co., 218 S.W.3d 671, 695 (Tex. 2006) (explaining that choice of law issues can be\nwaived unless the complaining party objects to the law being applied, requests application of\nanother state’s law, and requests judicial notice of the law of the other state).\n\n                                           15\n\f      Generally, when a cause of action accrues is a question of law. Provident Life\n\n& Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 221 (Tex. 2003). A cause of action\n\naccrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, when facts come into existence\n\nthat authorize a party to seek a judicial remedy. Id. In most cases, a cause of action\n\naccrues when a wrongful act causes a legal injury regardless of when the plaintiff\n\nlearns of that injury or if all the resulting damages have yet to occur. Id. However,\n\nan exception may defer accrual of a claim—the discovery rule. Id.\n\nM     Discovery Rule.\n\n      Statutes of limitations are intended to compel plaintiffs to assert their claims\n\n“within a reasonable period while the evidence is fresh in the minds of the parties and\n\nwitnesses.” Wagner & Brown, Ltd v. Horwood, 58 S.W.3d 732, 734 (Tex. 2001).\n\nThe public policy behind statutes of limitations is that it “is in society’s best interest\n\nto grant repose by requiring that disputes be settled or barred within a reasonable\n\ntime.” Id.\n\n      The discovery rule exception operates to defer accrual of a cause of action until\n\nthe plaintiff knows or, by exercising reasonable diligence, should know of the facts\n\ngiving rise to the claim. Id.; Austin Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Lofters, No. 03-14-00071-\n\nCV; 2015 TEX. APP. LEXIS 3115, *10 (Tex. App.–Austin, Apr. 1, 2015, pet. filed)\n\n(mem. op.).\n\n\n                                           16\n\f      The discovery rule is a “very limited exception to statutes of limitations.”\n\nHorwood, 58 S.W.3d at 734 (quoting Computer Assocs. Int’l v. Altai, Inc., 918\n\nS.W.3d 453, 455 (Tex. 1996)). The rule should be restricted to exceptional cases to\n\navoid defeating the purposes behind the limitation statutes. Treuil v. Treuil, 311\n\nS.W.3d 114, 118 (Tex. App.–Beaumont 2010, no pet.)(citing S.V. v. R.V., 933\n\nS.W.2d 1, 25 (Tex. 1996)). Thus, the discovery rule is only used when the plaintiff’s\n\ninjury is both “inherently undiscoverable” and “objectively verifiable.” Id. at 119;\n\nLofters, 2015 TEX. APP. LEXIS 3115, *10; Horwood, 58 S.W.3d at 734.\n\n      !      Inherently Undiscoverable.\n\n      “An injury is inherently undiscoverable if it is, by its nature, unlikely to be\n\ndiscovered within the prescribed limitations period, despite due diligence.”\n\nHorwood, 58 S.W.3d at 734-35. “Inherently undiscoverable” does not mean that a\n\nparticular plaintiff did not discover his or her particular injury within the applicable\n\nlimitations period. Id. Rather, the determination of whether an injury is “inherently\n\nundiscoverable” is made on a categorical basis. Id.\n\n      Accordingly, a court’s focus is on the type of injury, not the particular injury\n\nitself. Id. “Discovery rule cases focus on categorical ‘types of injury, not causes of\n\naction.’” Texas Health Presbyterian Hosp. Dallas v. Burch, No. 05-14-00665-CV,\n\n2015 TEX. APP. LEXIS 625, *7 (Tex., Jan. 22, 2015).\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      !      Pleading Requirement.\n\n      The discovery rule is also a plea in confession and avoidance. Woods v.\n\nWilliam M. Mercer, Inc., 769 S.W.2d 515, 517 (Tex. 1988). Consequently, a party\n\nseeking to avail himself of the discovery rule must plead the rule, either in his original\n\npetition or in an amended or supplemental petition in response to a defendant’s\n\nassertion of a statute of limitations defense as a matter of law. Id.\n\n      “A matter in avoidance of the statute of limitations that is not raised\n\naffirmatively by the pleadings will, therefore, be deemed waived.” Id. at 518;\n\nProctor v. White, 172 S.W.3d 649, 652 (Tex. App.–Eastland 2005, no pet.) (same);\n\nalso see Treuil, 311 S.W.3d at 114 (ex-wife amended original petition and asserted\n\ndiscovery rule after ex-husband asserted statute of limitations barred her claim to\n\nportion of his retirement benefits); In the Estate of Melchior, 365 S.W.3d 794, 799\n\n(Tex. App.–San Antonio 2012, pet. denied) (discovery rule held not applicable\n\nbecause Estate did not specifically plead it).\n\n      !      Burden of Proof.\n\n      Additionally, the party seeking to benefit from the discovery rule also bears the\n\nburden of proving that his injury was both “inherently undiscoverable” and\n\n“objectively verifiable.” Woods, 769 S.W.2d at 518. A party asserting the discovery\n\nrule at trial to avoid a statute of limitations bar must prove all elements of the rule.\n\n\n                                           18\n\fTipton v. Brock, 431 S.W.3d 673, 677 (Tex.

Reasonable Diligence.\n\n      Finally, the discovery rule does not excuse a party from exercising reasonable\n\ndiligence in protecting his own interests. Pitman v. Lightfoot, 937 S.W.2d 496, 510\n\n(Tex. App.–San Antonio 1992, writ denied); Conoco, Inc. v. Amarillo Nat’l Bank,\n\n14 S.W.3d 325, 328 (Tex. App.–Amarillo 2000, no pet.) (finding secured parties must\n\ntake some responsibility to ascertain status of their collateral and holding discovery\n\nrule inapplicable to toll statute of limitations).\n\n      Indeed, parties have an obligation to protect their interests by exercising due\n\ndiligence. HECI Exploration Co. v. Neel, 982 S.W.2d 881, 982 (Tex. 1998) (court\n\nheld that because mineral owners have some obligation to protect their interests by\n\nexercising reasonable diligence, their injury was not inherently undiscoverable, and\n\ndiscovery rule did not apply to their claims). Horwood, 58 S.W.3d at 737 (court held\n\ninjury was not inherently undiscoverable because royalty owner could discover such\n\ninjuries in timely manner by exercising due diligence).\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f      Whether reasonable diligence was used is generally a question of fact unless\n\nthe evidence is such that reasonable minds could not differ as to its effect. Pitman,\n\n937 S.W.2d at 510. Under these circumstances, the issue of reasonable diligence\n\nbecome a question of law. Id.\n\nM     Accrual of Teresa’s Injury.\n\n      In the case at bar, the Settlement Agreement required Paul to remit to Teresa\n\na portion of his retirement benefits “if, as, and when” they were received by Paul.\n\n(CR 1:4; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). Teresa’s injury therefore occurred on November\n\n1, 2004, when Paul received his retirement funds from Conoco and when upon his\n\nreceipt of same, he failed to immediately remit Teresa’s portion to her. See Treuil,\n\n311 S.W.3d at 118 (ex-wife’s injury occurred on date ex-husband withdrew all funds\n\nfrom retirement account and upon doing so, then failed to immediately remit ex-\n\nwife’s portion to her). Under the two-year statute of limitations found in TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE § 9.003(b), Teresa’s enforcement action was barred after November 4, 2006,\n\nunless the discovery rule applies in this case.\n\nM     Inapplicability of Discovery Rule.\n\n      !      Waiver of Discovery Rule.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in denying Paul’s statute of limitations\n\ndefense in the case at bar. (CR 1:45-46) (Appendix 1). Paul properly plead this\n\n\n                                          20\n\faffirmative defense upon being placed on notice that Teresa had registered the\n\nDivorce Decree in Texas. (CR 1:25). Additionally, Paul reasserted this affirmative\n\ndefense during the bench trial.3 (RR 2:29).\n\n       Because Paul plead properly plead this affirmative defense, Teresa was\n\nrequired to plead the discovery rule. See Woods, 769 S.W.2d at 517. If Teresa failed\n\nto plead that the discovery rule applied to the case at bar, she waived this exception,\n\nand the trial court could not on its own motion toll the running of the two-year statute\n\nof limitations. See Id. at 518.\n\n       A review of the Petition for Enforcement establishes that Teresa did not\n\nspecifically plead the application of the discovery rule. (CR 1:35-37). Teresa did\n\nnot amend the Petition for Enforcement prior to trial. The only language in the\n\nPetition for Enforcement which might be construed as alluding to the discovery rule\n\nis a single statement found on the second page of the Petition for Enforcement which\n\nreads as follows: “Petitioner became aware of this [Paul’s receipt of Conoco\n\nretirement benefits] in late 2012 or early 2013.” (CR 1:36). Such general statement\n\ndoes not satisfy the specific pleading requirement in regards to the discovery rule as\n\nset forth by the Texas Supreme Court. See Woods, 769 S.W.2d at 517-18.\n\n       3\n         Paul’s trial attorney actually argued that Teresa’s enforcement action was subject to a\nfour year statute of limitations; therefore her suit was barred as of November 4, 2008. (RR 2:29).\nAs Teresa filed the Petition for Enforcement on April 3, 2014, her action would still have been\nbarred if a four-year statute of limitations is applicable to the case at bar. (CR 1:35-37).\n\n                                               21\n\f      If Teresa was going to raise the application of the discovery rule at trial, she\n\nhad a duty to specifically plead this exception in her pleadings. As she failed to\n\nspecifically plead the applicability of the discovery rule in the Petition for\n\nEnforcement, Teresa waived this exception at trial. As such, the trial court erred in\n\nconcluding that the two-year statute of limitations began to run after August 2012 and\n\nalso erred in granting Teresa’s request to enforce the Divorce Decree. (CL#3; CL#4)\n\n(Appendix 2). Because the discovery rule did not toll the two-year statute of\n\nlimitations in this case as a matter of law, this Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment and hold Teresa take nothing by her enforcement action against Paul.\n\n         If this Court determines Teresa properly pled the applicability\n               of the discovery rule in the Petition for Enforcement,\n       Paul presents the following argument for the Court’s consideration.\n\n      !      No Inherently Undiscoverable Injury.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in granting the Petition For Enforcement\n\nbecause Teresa failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing the applicability of\n\nthe discovery rule in the case at bar. Specifically, Teresa failed to prove that her\n\ninjury in this case was inherently undiscoverable and therefore justified the tolling of\n\nthe two-year statute of limitations until she discovered her injury in August of 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f       To the contrary, if Teresa had simply used reasonable diligence in protecting\n\nher interest in Paul’s retirement benefits, she would have easily discovered his early\n\nretirement from Conoco and his subsequent withdrawal of all his retirement benefits.4\n\n              •       No Reasonable Diligence.\n\n       For example, at the time of the parties’ divorce, or any time over the next\n\nnineteen years, Teresa could have requested that a QDRO be entered by a trial court.\n\nOnce the QDRO was in place, Teresa could easily have sent a copy of same to\n\nConoco. Upon receipt of the QDRO, Conoco would have had a duty to notify Teresa\n\nof Paul’s withdrawal of his retirement benefits. Conoco would also have had a duty\n\nto segregate out her portion of Paul’s retirement benefits prior to making any\n\ndisbursements to Paul. However, Teresa introduced no evidence that from June 1,\n\n1987 through November 4, 2006, she made any effort to have a QDRO entered of\n\nrecord and a copy of same sent to Conoco.\n\n       Likewise, Teresa could have simply sent Conoco a certified copy of the\n\nDivorce Decree and Settlement Agreement immediately after the parties’ divorce or\n\n\n\n       4\n         There appears to be no Texas case specifically holding that an ex-spouse’s actions\nregarding his or her retirement accounts, as a category, are inherently undiscoverable. See\nTrueil, 311 S.W.3d at 119-20 (appellate court side-stepped issue of whether ex-husband’s failure\nto give ex-wife her portion of his retirement benefits as required under parties’ divorce decree\nconstituted an inherently undiscoverable injury). Such lack of authority is not surprising,\nhowever, as retirement accounts are easily discoverable and thus do not constitute the\nexceptional type of categorical injury to which the discovery rule should apply.\n\n                                              23\n\fanytime over the next nineteen years. If Teresa had placed Conoco on notice that she\n\nhad been awarded a portion of Paul’s retirement account in their divorce, Conoco\n\nwould have notified her that at Paul’s request, it had disbursed all of his retirement\n\nbenefits to him on November 1, 2004. However, Teresa introduced no evidence that\n\nfrom June 1, 1987 through November 4, 2006, she ever sent Conoco a copy of the\n\nDivorce Decree or the Settlement Agreement.\n\n      Teresa could also have simply picked up the telephone, called Conoco directly,\n\nand asked about the status of Paul’s retirement benefits at some point during the\n\nnineteen years after the parties’ divorce was finalized. If a telephone call was\n\nunsuccessful, Teresa could have sent Conoco a written letter inquiring about the\n\nstatus of Paul’s retirement benefits. However, Teresa introduced no evidence that\n\nfrom June 1, 1987 through November 4, 2006, she ever attempted to contact Conoco\n\ndirectly about Paul’s retirement benefits.\n\n      A simple inquiry to Conoco itself anytime between November 4, 2004 through\n\nNovember 4, 2006, would have brought Paul’s withdrawal of his retirement benefits\n\nto light. See Urbanczyk v. Urbanczyk, No. 07-07-0077-CV; 2009 TEX. APP. LEXIS\n\n587, *7 (Tex. App.–Amarillo, Jan. 29, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.) (court held discovery\n\nrule not applicable because plaintiff’s injury was not inherently undiscoverable; a\n\nsimple request to brokerage firm itself should have brought unauthorized transfer to\n\n\n                                         24\n\flight). All Teresa had to do was contact Conoco and she would have discovered her\n\ninjury. She simply chose not to make such contact.\n\n       Additionally, Teresa could have asked her children about the status of Paul’s\n\nwhereabouts and his current employment. If she had ever asked the children about\n\ntheir father, she would have learned---at a bare minimum---that Paul had retired from\n\nConoco and was living in San Angelo, Texas. Yet, Teresa intentionally chose to\n\nnever talk to her two children about their father.\n\n       Teresa testified that she never discussed Paul with her children because she did\n\nnot want her “children to be drug into any kind of stuff like that.” (RR 2:21).\n\nTeresa’s reticence in this regard might be considered laudable while the children were\n\nminors. However, Teresa’s reluctance to speak to her children about Paul became\n\nunreasonable when one considers that by 2004, both children were full-fledged\n\nadults----with their daughter being twenty-six or twenty-seven years old and their son\n\nbeing thirty-one or thirty-two years old. (RR 2:18). Simply checking with her two\n\nadult children regarding the status of Paul’s employment and his current whereabouts\n\nwould not have caused her children any undue consternation.5\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Paul testified that Teresa should have known where he was living and working through\ncontact with their children. (RR 2:10).\n\n                                             25\n\f      To the contrary, if Teresa had simply asked one of her children during 2004\n\nwhere Paul was working and living, her children would have informed her that he had\n\nretired early from Conoco and was living in San Angelo, Texas. Such information\n\nwould have spurred Teresa to make further inquiries about the status of Paul’s\n\nretirement benefits. As a result of these inquiries, Teresa would have learned of\n\nPaul’s early withdrawal of all his retirement benefits.\n\n      Finally, Teresa could have always contacted Paul directly during the nineteen\n\nyears after the parties’ divorce to determine where he was living and working. Teresa\n\ntestified that she had only seen Paul “to talk to him one time” since they were\n\ndivorced. (RR 2:24). She further testified that this in-person meeting happened prior\n\nto his retirement from Conoco. (Id.).\n\n      It was unnecessary, however, for Teresa to actually meet with Paul in person\n\nto make her diligent inquiries. She could have simply called him on the telephone,\n\nsent him a letter, or sent him an email. Instead, she failed to make any effort\n\nwhatsoever to contact Paul about her portion of his retirement benefits from Conoco\n\nfor over twenty-five years.\n\n      The Record reflects Teresa had several sources from which she could have\n\ntimely discovered her injury, including Conoco, her two children, and Paul himself.\n\nAs such, Teresa’s injury in this case was not inherently undiscoverable. See\n\n\n                                         26\n\fHorwood, 58 S.W.3d at 737 (holding that when a party can seek information from\n\nseveral sources to evaluate the propriety of another’s action, discovery rule does not\n\napply).\n\n             •      Teresa’s Specialized Knowledge.\n\n      The Record in this case establishes that Teresa failed to use reasonable\n\ndiligence to discover Paul’s early withdrawal of his retirement benefits and his failure\n\nto send her a portion of the cash funds he received from Conoco to which she was\n\nentitled under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Teresa’s lack of reasonable\n\ndiligence becomes even more apparent when one considers her educational\n\nbackground and professional expertise.\n\n      Teresa testified that she was licensed as an attorney in the State of Oklahoma\n\nin February of 1990. (RR 2:23). She testified that she was also licensed to practice\n\nlaw in Texas in November of 1990. (Id.). Over the next twenty years, Teresa\n\ntestified she practiced law in both Houston, Texas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\n(Id.). At the trial, Teresa testified she was currently retired and living in Florida--\n\nhaving surrendered her law license in 2010. (RR 2:20,23). She further testified that\n\nshe became disabled after a motor scooter accident in October of 2006 and was\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fcurrently receiving monthly federal disability payments in the amount of $1,400.00.6\n\n(RR 2:20,23-24).\n\n         Teresa graduated from law school, passed two bar exams, and practiced law in\n\nboth Texas and Oklahoma for approximately twenty years. (RR 2:23). As such, she\n\nnot only had the opportunity to use reasonable diligence to timely discover her injury\n\nin this case, she also had the legal knowledge, expertise, and skill to discover Paul’s\n\nactions concerning his Conoco retirement benefits. However, she failed to utilize her\n\nspecialized knowledge to protect the property interest in Paul’s retirement benefits\n\nwhich she was awarded under the Divorce Decree.\n\n         Furthermore, Teresa specifically testified she knew that she had been awarded\n\na portion of Paul’s retirement benefits under the Divorce Decree and that this property\n\nright was to accrue at some point in the future. (RR 2:24-25). Yet, when questioned\n\nat trial as to why she waited approximately twenty-five years to take any action to\n\nenforce this property right, Teresa responded “–what would you have me do?” (RR\n\n2:25).\n\n         Texas case law would have Teresa use reasonable diligence to discover her\n\ninjury in this case. The discovery rule does not excuse Teresa’s failure to use\n\n         6\n        As to the nature of Teresa’s disability, she testified that she had torn up both her knee\nand back during the motor scooter accident. (RR 2:23-24). She also testified that she could no\nlonger practice law because she was on “morphine and a lot of drugs” and she believed it would\nbe committing malpractice for her to represent a client. (RR 2:24).\n\n                                                28\n\freasonable diligence to protect her property interests in Paul’s retirement benefits.\n\nTeresa had several different means and sources available to her which she could have\n\nutilized and timely discovered Paul’s actions in regards to his Conoco retirement\n\nbenefits. As a practicing attorney, Teresa also had the specialized knowledge and\n\nlegal skills she could have used to timely discover her injury. However, from 1987\n\nuntil 2012, Teresa intentionally chose not to take any actions at all until she first\n\nlearned of Paul’s actions and then contacted an attorney regarding the issue of the\n\nretirement benefits. (RR 2:21).\n\n      Teresa’s lack of reasonable diligence prevented her from discovering her injury\n\nin this case. Accordingly, Teresa’s injury was not inherently undiscoverable as\n\nrequired for the application of the discovery rule. Because the discovery rule is\n\ninapplicable to the case at bar, Teresa’s enforcement action is barred by the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations under TEX. FAM. CODE § 9.003(b) as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      Because Teresa failed to meet her burden of proof to receive the benefit of the\n\ndiscovery rule, the trial court erred in concluding the two-year statute of limitations\n\nwas tolled and only began running as of August, 2012. The trial court also erred in\n\nconcluding the Motion for Enforcement was timely filed as of April, 2014. Based on\n\nthese erroneous conclusions of law, the trial court abused its discretion in granting\n\nthe Petition for Enforcement and in awarding Teresa a money judgment for the total\n\nsum of $51,635.60.\n\n      This Court should therefore 1) find the discovery rule is inapplicable to this\n\ncase and 2) conclude that Teresa’ enforcement action was barred by the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations found in TEX. FAM. CODE § 9.003(b). Based on this finding and\n\nconclusion, the Court should reverse the trial court’s judgment in all respects and\n\nrender judgment that Teresa take nothing by her enforcement action against Paul.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f                                       Prayer\n\n      Appellant Paul D.

Plaintiff (former wife) and Defendant (former husband) were divorced\n            on June 1, 1987 in New Mexico. Plaintiff was awarded a portion of\n            Defendant's retirement acquired through Defendant's employment\n            with Conoco. Plaintiffs portion was to be paid if, as and when\n            received by husband. Wife's portion was defined in the Divorce.\n     2.     Defendant worked for Conoco for a total of 25 years, from February 12,\n            1979 to 2004.     In 2004, Targa purchased Conoco-Phillips and\n            Defendant continued to work for Targa. While working for Conoco, he\n            was married to Plaintiff for 8 years, 3 months (2179 to 6/1/87).\n     3.     Defendant received $295,500.61 retirement benefits from Conoco\n            employment on 11/1/2004.\n     4.     Defendant used the retirement distribution to pay bills, including a\n            debt payable to Wells Fargo that was secured by a lien on Defendant's\n            homestead.\n     5.     Defendant paid Wells Fargo in August, 2012.\n     6.     Wells Fargo signed a Release of lien on August 29, 2012.\n     7.     Plaintiff learned of this retirement distribution sometime after August\n            2012 when her daughter told her that Defendant was mad at a loan\n            company and paid them with proceeds from a retirement distribution.\n     8.     Plaintiff filed a Notice of Registration of Foreign Decree in Tom Green\n            County Texas District Court on April4, 2013 and then gave notice to\n            Defendant of the Registration and in a note stated \"We've registered\n            this decree in anticipation of having to enforce a portion of that decree\n            regarding your Conoco retirement.\"\n     9.     On April 22, 2013, Defendant filed a response, including affirmative\n            defenses of laches and statute of limitations. Defendant requested a\n            hearing to contest enforcement of the registered order.\n     10.    On April3, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Petition to Enforce the Order.\n\n\n\n\n     Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                           52\n\f  11.   Plaintiff has incurred reasonable and necessary attorney fees of\n        $2,600 to collect her share of the retirement and court costs.\n  12.   Plaintiffs share of the retirement account is $48,757.60 based on the\n        formula in the Decree [112 times (Feb 1979 to June 1, 1987 i.e. 8 years\n        3 months) divided by 25 years with the Company (300 months).\n\n\n               Conclusions of Law:\n  1.    Family Code Section 9.003(b) provides:\n        A suit to enforce the division of future property not in existence at the\n        time of the original decree must be filed before the second anniversary\n        of the date the right to the property matures or accrues or the decree\n        becomes final, whichever date is later, or the suit is barred.\n  2.    The earliest Plaintiff learned about the retirement distribution to\n        Defendant was after August 2012.\n  3.    The Statute of Limitations began to run after August 2012.\n  4.    Suit to enforce the future right was filed April2014, within 2 years of\n        Plaintiffs discovery of the distribution.                              '\n  5.    Laches is an equitable remedy to prevent an inequitable result.\n        Defense of laches is denied.\n  6.    The Court awards Plaintiff a Judgment for $48,757.60, plus $2,600\n        attorney fees, all costs of Court and interest as allowed by law.\n\n\n\n\nDate Signed\n                                         /~\n                                         Ben Woodward, Judge Presiding\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of Fact and Conclusions ofLaw\n                                        53\n\fAPPENDIX3\n\f                                               (f\n\n                                                                                                                                                                    ..D\n                                                                                                                                               '87 JUU -t P4 :Qj\n\n\n                            IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF EDDY COUNTY\n                                                              STATE OF NEW MEXICO\n\n  PAUL D.

(CR 1:7-22,35-37).\n\nCourse of Proceedings: On or about March 28, 2013, Teresa registered the parties’\n                       1987 New Mexico divorce decree in Texas. (CR 1:7-22).\n                       On April 4, 2013, Teresa provided notice to Paul of the\n                       registration of a foreign decree. (CR 1:23-24). On or\n                       about April 22, 2013, Paul filed a response in which he\n                       contested such registration, asserted various affirmative\n                       defenses, and requested a hearing. (CR 1:25-26). On or\n                       about April 3, 2014, Teresa filed a Motion for Enforcement\n                       of Order seeking to enforce a specific provision of the\n                       parties’ divorce decree pertaining to the division of Paul’s\n                       retirement pension. (CR 1:35-37).\n\n                         A bench trial was held on July 22, 2014. (RR 1: 1). At the\n                         conclusion of the bench trial, the trial court took the matter\n                         under consideration. (RR 2:30). On or about August 20,\n                         2014, the trial court issued a letter ruling, and on\n                         September 15, 2014, the trial court entered a written\n                         judgment denying all of Paul’s affirmative defenses,\n                         granting Teresa’s request to enforce the specific property\n                         provision pertaining to Paul’s retirement benefits, and\n                         awarding Teresa a total money judgment of $51,635.60.\n                         (CR 1:41,44-45) (Appendix 1).\n\n                         On or about October 3, 2014, Paul timely requested that the\n                         trial court enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n                         (CR 1:51-52). On or about October 22, 2014, the trial\n                         court entered its written findings and conclusions. (CR\n                         1:52-53) (Appendix 2). On or about December 12, 2014,\n                         Paul timely filed his Notice of Appeal. (CR 1:57-58).\n\n\n\n\n                                         xi\n\fTrial Court:             The Honorable Ben Woodward, 119th Judicial District\n                         Court, Tom Green County, Texas.\n\nTrial Court Disposition: Judgment dated September 15, 2014. (CR 1:44-45)\n                         (Appendix 1). The trial court’s judgment awarded Teresa\n                         $48,757.60 in actual damages, $278.00 in court costs, and\n                         $2,600.00 in attorney’s fees. (Id.).\n\nParties:                 Petitioner/Appellee:  Teresa A. Simmons\n                         Respondent/Appellant: Paul D. Simmons\n\n\n\n\n                                       xii\n\f                     Issue Presented\n\nIssue No. 1:   Teresa’s enforcement action was subject to the applicable\n               statute of limitations. Paul properly raised this defense in\n               his pleadings and during the bench trial. Did the trial court\n               abuse its discretion by enforcing the parties’ 1987 divorce\n               decree and awarding Teresa $51,635.60 when her\n               enforcement action was barred by this affirmative defense?\n\n\n\n\n                              xiii\n\f                              Statement of Facts\n\nM     The Parties’ Marital History.\n\n      Paul and Teresa were married on August 22, 1969. (RR 2:16). They were both\n\nnineteen years old when they got married. (RR 3:PX#5). During the course of their\n\nmarriage, they had two children–a son and a daughter. (RR 2:18; 3:PX#5). After\n\nbeing married for approximately eighteen years, the couple decided to get divorced.\n\n(RR 2:16).\n\n      Paul and Teresa’s divorce was final on June 1, 1987, and a written Decree of\n\nDissolution of Marriage, (the “Divorce Decree”), was entered on that same day in\n\nEddy County, New Mexico. (CR 1:8-10; RR 2:16; 3:PX#4; FF#1) (Appendices 2-3).\n\nAt the time of the parties’ divorce, their son was approximately fourteen or fifteen\n\nyears old and their daughter was approximately nine or ten years old. (RR 2:18).\n\nM     The Parties’ Settlement Agreement.\n\n      Paul and Teresa resolved all issues pertaining to their divorce through the\n\nexecution of a Child Custody, Support and Property Settlement Agreement, (the\n\n“Settlement Agreement”). (CR 1:11-21; RR 2:16-17; 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). The\n\nSettlement Agreement was approved by the New Mexico trial court and properly\n\nincorporated into the Divorce Decree. (CR 1:8-10; RR 3:PX#4) (Appendix 3). Under\n\nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paul retained primary custody of the two\n\n                                         1\n\fchildren during the school year, and Teresa had custody of the children during their\n\nsummer vacation. (CR 1:12; RR 2:18; 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3).\n\n      As to child support, Paul agreed to pay Teresa $100.00 per month for every\n\nthirty days she had physical custody of the children. (CR 1:13; RR 3:PX#5)\n\n(Appendix 3). The parties also agreed that Teresa would not be required to pay any\n\nchild support while she attended law school. (Id.). Additionally, the parties agreed\n\nthat the New Mexico trial court would retain jurisdiction to modify the custody or\n\nchild support provisions included in the Settlement Agreement once Teresa graduated\n\nfrom law school. (Id.).\n\n      It appears the parties never petitioned the trial court to modify these custody\n\nor child support provisions. Paul testified Teresa never paid him any child support\n\nand that he had provided the total support for the two children. (RR 2:11). In\n\ncontrast, Teresa testified that their daughter came to live with her at around the age\n\nof fifteen years. (RR 2:20). She further testified that during the time the child was\n\nliving with her, Paul maintained insurance on their daughter but provided no other\n\nfinancial support for the child during this time period. (Id.). It was undisputed that\n\nby the day of trial, both of the children were over twenty-one years of age. (RR 2:11).\n\n      Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paul was also required to pay\n\n$100.00 each month towards Teresa’s credit card purchases for gas and automobile\n\n\n                                          2\n\fmaintenance for a period of eighteen months, that is, until December 31, 1988. (Id.).\n\n      Regarding the division of the parties’ property, Teresa testified that the only\n\nproperty she actually got out of the divorce was a car, her clothing, jewelry, and some\n\npatio furniture. (RR 2:19). Teresa testified that she basically “left” Paul all the\n\nproperty, including her “grandmother’s dishes.” (Id.). Her trial testimony in this\n\nregard was misleading, if not entirely false.\n\n      A careful review of the terms of the Settlement Agreement reveals Teresa was\n\nawarded a substantial amount of the parties’ community property, including but not\n\nlimited to, the following: two cars, jewelry, a computer, two beds, two desks, a\n\nstereo, two guns, lamps, a dining table and four chairs, a TV, a microwave, and patio\n\nfurniture. (CR 1:14; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). Additionally, under the terms of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Teresa was specifically awarded her grandmother’s dishes.\n\n(Id.). Teresa was also awarded $9,000.00 which constituted cash monies advanced\n\nfor her school expenses and proceeds from her teacher retirement benefits. (Id.).\n\n      Undisputedly, the parties owned a home at the time of their divorce. (RR\n\n1:19). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Teresa was awarded no equity\n\nin this home. (CR 1:14,16; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). However, it was also\n\nundisputed that under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Paul became solely\n\nresponsible for payment of the $82,200.00 mortgage that was attached to the parties’\n\n\n                                          3\n\fhome, along with approximately $35,000.00 in miscellaneous debt that the parties had\n\nincurred as of the date of their divorce. (CR 1:16-17; RR 3:PX#5). In contrast,\n\npursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Teresa did not assume\n\nresponsibility for payment of any of the $117,000.00 community property debt that\n\nthe parties had accumulated during their eighteen year long marriage. (Id.).\n\n      Teresa testified that she left the majority of the furniture in the house because\n\nshe did not want “the kids to just feel turned upside-down by everything.” (RR 2:19).\n\nTeresa’s choice not to take possession of the property she was awarded under the\n\nDivorce Decree for the sake of her children is a far cry from her representation that\n\nshe “left” Paul basically all the property in the divorce. Rather, the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial reveals the final property division in the parties’ 1987 divorce was\n\nmore than fair to Teresa.\n\nM     The Division of Paul’s Retirement Benefits.\n\n      It was also undisputed at trial that under the terms of the Settlement\n\nAgreement, Teresa was awarded a portion of Paul’s retirement benefits. (CR 1:14;\n\nRR 2:17; 3:PX#5; FF#1) (Appendices 2-3). Specifically, this provision of the\n\nSettlement Agreement reads as follows:\n\n      (6) Division of Community Property. The parties community\n      property shall be divided as follows:\n\n      A.     Wife shall have set over to her as her sole and separate property:\n\n                                              4\n\f                          ...\n\n             23. A portion of Husband’s retirement, pension, thrift, profit\n      sharing and other employee benefits acquired through Husband’s\n      employment with Conoco, to be paid if, as, and when received by\n      Husband. Wife’s portion shall be one-half times a fraction (the\n      numerator of which shall be the number of years the parties were\n      married during Husband’s employment with Conoco and the\n      denominator of which shall be the number of years Husband or his\n      employer, or both, contributed to the plan or benefit) times the amount\n      of the benefit received by Husband.\n\n(CR 1:14; RR 3:PX#5; FF#1) (Appendices 2-3). There was no evidence introduced\n\nat trial that a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, (“QDRO”), to this effect was ever\n\nentered by any trial court or that Conoco was ever placed on notice of this particular\n\nprovision of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nM     Conoco’s Payment of Paul’s Retirement Benefits.\n\n      Paul testified he began working for Conoco on February 12, 1979. (RR 1:6;\n\nFF#2) (Appendix 2). Over the next twenty-six years, Paul continued his employment\n\nwith Conoco. (RR 1:8). Paul testified that on March 26, 2004, his employment with\n\nConoco ended. (RR 1:8; FF#2) (Appendix 2).\n\n      Paul also testified that on November 1, 2004, he cashed out his retirement\n\nbenefits from Conoco. (RR 1:7). A copy of a check dated November 1, 2004, from\n\nArvest Trust Company, NA, the paying agent for ConocoPhillips Retirement\n\nBenefits, was introduced into evidence at trial and reflected that Paul received\n\n\n                                          5\n\f$295,500.61 in retirement benefits from Conoco. (RR 2:8; 3:PX#2; FF#3) (Appendix\n\n2).\n\n       Paul testified he used the money to pay off a “bunch of bills and debt and\n\neverything else.”1 (RR 2:8). He further testified that as of the day of trial, these cash\n\nmonies were “gone” and he did not have them any more. (Id.). It was undisputed at\n\ntrial that Paul did not forward Teresa her share of the money he received when he\n\ncashed out his retirement benefits with Conoco. (Id.).\n\nM      Teresa’s Enforcement Action.\n\n       Approximately twenty-six years after the parties finalized their divorce, and\n\napproximately eight and a half years after Paul cashed in his retirement benefits with\n\nConoco, Teresa filed a Petition for Enforcement of Order, (“Petition for\n\nEnforcement”), seeking to enforce the Divorce Decree. (CR 1:35-37; FF#10)\n\n(Appendix 2). Paul asserted various affirmative defenses to Teresa’s enforcement\n\naction, including but not limited to, the statute of limitations and laches. (CR 1:25-\n\n26; FF#9) (Appendix 2).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The trial court found that Paul had utilized some of the retirement benefits he received\non November 1, 2004, to pay off a mortgage on his home in August of 2012. (FF#5). (Appendix\n2). However, there was no evidence that Paul actually used these particular retirement benefits\nfor that purpose. Rather, Paul simply testified that he had paid off his home mortgage in 2012\nand did not identify the funds he utilized in paying this debt. (RR 2:13). Accordingly, the trial\ncourt’s finding of fact in this regard was incorrect.\n\n                                                6\n\f      A bench trial was held on July 22, 2014. (RR 1:14). Paul and Teresa were the\n\nonly two witnesses at the bench trial. (RR 2:5,15). At the conclusion of the bench\n\ntrial, the trial court took the matter under advisement. (RR 2:30).\n\n      On August 20, 2014—approximately twenty-seven years after the parties’\n\ndivorce was final—the trial court issued a letter ruling denying all of Paul’s\n\naffirmative defenses and awarding Teresa $48,757.60 in actual damages, $2,600.00\n\nin attorney’s fees, and costs of court. (CR 1:41; CL#6) (Appendix 2). On September\n\n15, 2014, the trial court entered a written judgment awarding Teresa a total sum of\n\n$51,635.60, with postjudgment interest accruing at the rate of six percent. (CR 1:44-\n\n45; CL#6) (Appendices 1-2). It is from this judgment that Paul now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                           Summary of the Argument\n\n      Teresa waited approximately twenty-six years to seek enforcement of the\n\nDivorce Decree’s provisions awarding her a portion of Paul’s retirement benefits.\n\nPaul properly asserted that the statue of limitations barred Teresa’s enforcement\n\naction. Teresa’s cause of action accrued on November 1, 2004 and was barred after\n\nNovember 1, 2006.\n\n      Teresa failed to specifically plead the applicability of the discovery rule prior\n\nto trial. She also failed to prove her injury in this case was inherently undiscoverable,\n\nnotwithstanding reasonable diligence. The trial court thus erred in concluding the\n\ndiscovery rule tolled the applicable two-year statute of limitations found in TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE § 9.003(b). Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in enforcing the\n\nprovision of the Divorce Decree in regards to the division of Paul’s retirement\n\nbenefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                               Standards of Review\n\nM     Findings of Fact.\n\n      A trial court’s findings of fact have the same force and dignity as a jury’s\n\nverdict.

Id.\n\nM     Accrual of Teresa’s Injury.\n\n      In the case at bar, the Settlement Agreement required Paul to remit to Teresa\n\na portion of his retirement benefits “if, as, and when” they were received by Paul.\n\n(CR 1:4; RR 3:PX#5) (Appendix 3). Teresa’s injury therefore occurred on November\n\n1, 2004, when Paul received his retirement funds from Conoco and when upon his\n\nreceipt of same, he failed to immediately remit Teresa’s portion to her. See Treuil,\n\n311 S.W.3d at 118 (ex-wife’s injury occurred on date ex-husband withdrew all funds\n\nfrom retirement account and upon doing so, then failed to immediately remit ex-\n\nwife’s portion to her). Under the two-year statute of limitations found in TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE § 9.003(b), Teresa’s enforcement action was barred after November 4, 2006,\n\nunless the discovery rule applies in this case.\n\nM     Inapplicability of Discovery Rule.\n\n      !      Waiver of Discovery Rule.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in denying Paul’s statute of limitations\n\ndefense in the case at bar. (CR 1:45-46) (Appendix 1). Paul properly plead this\n\n\n                                          20\n\faffirmative defense upon being placed on notice that Teresa had registered the\n\nDivorce Decree in Texas. (CR 1:25). Additionally, Paul reasserted this affirmative\n\ndefense during the bench trial.3 (RR 2:29).\n\n       Because Paul plead properly plead this affirmative defense, Teresa was\n\nrequired to plead the discovery rule. See Woods, 769 S.W.2d at 517. If Teresa failed\n\nto plead that the discovery rule applied to the case at bar, she waived this exception,\n\nand the trial court could not on its own motion toll the running of the two-year statute\n\nof limitations. See Id. at 518.\n\n       A review of the Petition for Enforcement establishes that Teresa did not\n\nspecifically plead the application of the discovery rule. (CR 1:35-37). Teresa did\n\nnot amend the Petition for Enforcement prior to trial. The only language in the\n\nPetition for Enforcement which might be construed as alluding to the discovery rule\n\nis a single statement found on the second page of the Petition for Enforcement which\n\nreads as follows: “Petitioner became aware of this [Paul’s receipt of Conoco\n\nretirement benefits] in late 2012 or early 2013.” (CR 1:36). Such general statement\n\ndoes not satisfy the specific pleading requirement in regards to the discovery rule as\n\nset forth by the Texas Supreme Court. See Woods, 769 S.W.2d at 517-18.\n\n       3\n         Paul’s trial attorney actually argued that Teresa’s enforcement action was subject to a\nfour year statute of limitations; therefore her suit was barred as of November 4, 2008. (RR 2:29).\nAs Teresa filed the Petition for Enforcement on April 3, 2014, her action would still have been\nbarred if a four-year statute of limitations is applicable to the case at bar. (CR 1:35-37).\n\n                                               21\n\f      If Teresa was going to raise the application of the discovery rule at trial, she\n\nhad a duty to specifically plead this exception in her pleadings. As she failed to\n\nspecifically plead the applicability of the discovery rule in the Petition for\n\nEnforcement, Teresa waived this exception at trial. As such, the trial court erred in\n\nconcluding that the two-year statute of limitations began to run after August 2012 and\n\nalso erred in granting Teresa’s request to enforce the Divorce Decree. (CL#3; CL#4)\n\n(Appendix 2). Because the discovery rule did not toll the two-year statute of\n\nlimitations in this case as a matter of law, this Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment and hold Teresa take nothing by her enforcement action against Paul.\n\n         If this Court determines Teresa properly pled the applicability\n               of the discovery rule in the Petition for Enforcement,\n       Paul presents the following argument for the Court’s consideration.\n\n      !      No Inherently Undiscoverable Injury.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in granting the Petition For Enforcement\n\nbecause Teresa failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing the applicability of\n\nthe discovery rule in the case at bar. Specifically, Teresa failed to prove that her\n\ninjury in this case was inherently undiscoverable and therefore justified the tolling of\n\nthe two-year statute of limitations until she discovered her injury in August of 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f       To the contrary, if Teresa had simply used reasonable diligence in protecting\n\nher interest in Paul’s retirement benefits, she would have easily discovered his early\n\nretirement from Conoco and his subsequent withdrawal of all his retirement benefits.4\n\n              •       No Reasonable Diligence.\n\n       For example, at the time of the parties’ divorce, or any time over the next\n\nnineteen years, Teresa could have requested that a QDRO be entered by a trial court.\n\nOnce the QDRO was in place, Teresa could easily have sent a copy of same to\n\nConoco. Upon receipt of the QDRO, Conoco would have had a duty to notify Teresa\n\nof Paul’s withdrawal of his retirement benefits. Conoco would also have had a duty\n\nto segregate out her portion of Paul’s retirement benefits prior to making any\n\ndisbursements to Paul. However, Teresa introduced no evidence that from June 1,\n\n1987 through November 4, 2006, she made any effort to have a QDRO entered of\n\nrecord and a copy of same sent to Conoco.\n\n       Likewise, Teresa could have simply sent Conoco a certified copy of the\n\nDivorce Decree and Settlement Agreement immediately after the parties’ divorce or\n\n\n\n       4\n         There appears to be no Texas case specifically holding that an ex-spouse’s actions\nregarding his or her retirement accounts, as a category, are inherently undiscoverable. See\nTrueil, 311 S.W.3d at 119-20 (appellate court side-stepped issue of whether ex-husband’s failure\nto give ex-wife her portion of his retirement benefits as required under parties’ divorce decree\nconstituted an inherently undiscoverable injury). Such lack of authority is not surprising,\nhowever, as retirement accounts are easily discoverable and thus do not constitute the\nexceptional type of categorical injury to which the discovery rule should apply.\n\n                                              23\n\fanytime over the next nineteen years. If Teresa had placed Conoco on notice that she\n\nhad been awarded a portion of Paul’s retirement account in their divorce, Conoco\n\nwould have notified her that at Paul’s request, it had disbursed all of his retirement\n\nbenefits to him on November 1, 2004. However, Teresa introduced no evidence that\n\nfrom June 1, 1987 through November 4, 2006, she ever sent Conoco a copy of the\n\nDivorce Decree or the Settlement Agreement.\n\n      Teresa could also have simply picked up the telephone, called Conoco directly,\n\nand asked about the status of Paul’s retirement benefits at some point during the\n\nnineteen years after the parties’ divorce was finalized. If a telephone call was\n\nunsuccessful, Teresa could have sent Conoco a written letter inquiring about the\n\nstatus of Paul’s retirement benefits. However, Teresa introduced no evidence that\n\nfrom June 1, 1987 through November 4, 2006, she ever attempted to contact Conoco\n\ndirectly about Paul’s retirement benefits.\n\n      A simple inquiry to Conoco itself anytime between November 4, 2004 through\n\nNovember 4, 2006, would have brought Paul’s withdrawal of his retirement benefits\n\nto light. See Urbanczyk v. Urbanczyk, No. 07-07-0077-CV; 2009 TEX. APP. LEXIS\n\n587, *7 (Tex. App.–Amarillo, Jan. 29, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.) (court held discovery\n\nrule not applicable because plaintiff’s injury was not inherently undiscoverable; a\n\nsimple request to brokerage firm itself should have brought unauthorized transfer to\n\n\n                                         24\n\flight). All Teresa had to do was contact Conoco and she would have discovered her\n\ninjury. She simply chose not to make such contact.\n\n       Additionally, Teresa could have asked her children about the status of Paul’s\n\nwhereabouts and his current employment. If she had ever asked the children about\n\ntheir father, she would have learned---at a bare minimum---that Paul had retired from\n\nConoco and was living in San Angelo, Texas. Yet, Teresa intentionally chose to\n\nnever talk to her two children about their father.\n\n       Teresa testified that she never discussed Paul with her children because she did\n\nnot want her “children to be drug into any kind of stuff like that.” (RR 2:21).\n\nTeresa’s reticence in this regard might be considered laudable while the children were\n\nminors. However, Teresa’s reluctance to speak to her children about Paul became\n\nunreasonable when one considers that by 2004, both children were full-fledged\n\nadults----with their daughter being twenty-six or twenty-seven years old and their son\n\nbeing thirty-one or thirty-two years old. (RR 2:18). Simply checking with her two\n\nadult children regarding the status of Paul’s employment and his current whereabouts\n\nwould not have caused her children any undue consternation.5\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Paul testified that Teresa should have known where he was living and working through\ncontact with their children. (RR 2:10).\n\n                                             25\n\f      To the contrary, if Teresa had simply asked one of her children during 2004\n\nwhere Paul was working and living, her children would have informed her that he had\n\nretired early from Conoco and was living in San Angelo, Texas. Such information\n\nwould have spurred Teresa to make further inquiries about the status of Paul’s\n\nretirement benefits. As a result of these inquiries, Teresa would have learned of\n\nPaul’s early withdrawal of all his retirement benefits.\n\n      Finally, Teresa could have always contacted Paul directly during the nineteen\n\nyears after the parties’ divorce to determine where he was living and working. Teresa\n\ntestified that she had only seen Paul “to talk to him one time” since they were\n\ndivorced. (RR 2:24). She further testified that this in-person meeting happened prior\n\nto his retirement from Conoco. (Id.).\n\n      It was unnecessary, however, for Teresa to actually meet with Paul in person\n\nto make her diligent inquiries. She could have simply called him on the telephone,\n\nsent him a letter, or sent him an email. Instead, she failed to make any effort\n\nwhatsoever to contact Paul about her portion of his retirement benefits from Conoco\n\nfor over twenty-five years.\n\n      The Record reflects Teresa had several sources from which she could have\n\ntimely discovered her injury, including Conoco, her two children, and Paul himself.\n\nAs such, Teresa’s injury in this case was not inherently undiscoverable. See\n\n\n                                         26\n\fHorwood, 58 S.W.3d at 737 (holding that when a party can seek information from\n\nseveral sources to evaluate the propriety of another’s action, discovery rule does not\n\napply).\n\n             •      Teresa’s Specialized Knowledge.\n\n      The Record in this case establishes that Teresa failed to use reasonable\n\ndiligence to discover Paul’s early withdrawal of his retirement benefits and his failure\n\nto send her a portion of the cash funds he received from Conoco to which she was\n\nentitled under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Teresa’s lack of reasonable\n\ndiligence becomes even more apparent when one considers her educational\n\nbackground and professional expertise.\n\n      Teresa testified that she was licensed as an attorney in the State of Oklahoma\n\nin February of 1990. (RR 2:23). She testified that she was also licensed to practice\n\nlaw in Texas in November of 1990. (Id.). Over the next twenty years, Teresa\n\ntestified she practiced law in both Houston, Texas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\n(Id.). At the trial, Teresa testified she was currently retired and living in Florida--\n\nhaving surrendered her law license in 2010. (RR 2:20,23). She further testified that\n\nshe became disabled after a motor scooter accident in October of 2006 and was\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fcurrently receiving monthly federal disability payments in the amount of $1,400.00.6\n\n(RR 2:20,23-24).\n\n         Teresa graduated from law school, passed two bar exams, and practiced law in\n\nboth Texas and Oklahoma for approximately twenty years. (RR 2:23). As such, she\n\nnot only had the opportunity to use reasonable diligence to timely discover her injury\n\nin this case, she also had the legal knowledge, expertise, and skill to discover Paul’s\n\nactions concerning his Conoco retirement benefits. However, she failed to utilize her\n\nspecialized knowledge to protect the property interest in Paul’s retirement benefits\n\nwhich she was awarded under the Divorce Decree.\n\n         Furthermore, Teresa specifically testified she knew that she had been awarded\n\na portion of Paul’s retirement benefits under the Divorce Decree and that this property\n\nright was to accrue at some point in the future. (RR 2:24-25). Yet, when questioned\n\nat trial as to why she waited approximately twenty-five years to take any action to\n\nenforce this property right, Teresa responded “–what would you have me do?” (RR\n\n2:25).\n\n         Texas case law would have Teresa use reasonable diligence to discover her\n\ninjury in this case. The discovery rule does not excuse Teresa’s failure to use\n\n         6\n        As to the nature of Teresa’s disability, she testified that she had torn up both her knee\nand back during the motor scooter accident. (RR 2:23-24). She also testified that she could no\nlonger practice law because she was on “morphine and a lot of drugs” and she believed it would\nbe committing malpractice for her to represent a client. (RR 2:24).\n\n                                                28\n\freasonable diligence to protect her property interests in Paul’s retirement benefits.\n\nTeresa had several different means and sources available to her which she could have\n\nutilized and timely discovered Paul’s actions in regards to his Conoco retirement\n\nbenefits. As a practicing attorney, Teresa also had the specialized knowledge and\n\nlegal skills she could have used to timely discover her injury. However, from 1987\n\nuntil 2012, Teresa intentionally chose not to take any actions at all until she first\n\nlearned of Paul’s actions and then contacted an attorney regarding the issue of the\n\nretirement benefits. (RR 2:21).\n\n      Teresa’s lack of reasonable diligence prevented her from discovering her injury\n\nin this case. Accordingly, Teresa’s injury was not inherently undiscoverable as\n\nrequired for the application of the discovery rule. Because the discovery rule is\n\ninapplicable to the case at bar, Teresa’s enforcement action is barred by the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations under TEX. FAM. CODE § 9.003(b) as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      Because Teresa failed to meet her burden of proof to receive the benefit of the\n\ndiscovery rule, the trial court erred in concluding the two-year statute of limitations\n\nwas tolled and only began running as of August, 2012. The trial court also erred in\n\nconcluding the Motion for Enforcement was timely filed as of April, 2014. Based on\n\nthese erroneous conclusions of law, the trial court abused its discretion in granting\n\nthe Petition for Enforcement and in awarding Teresa a money judgment for the total\n\nsum of $51,635.60.\n\n      This Court should therefore 1) find the discovery rule is inapplicable to this\n\ncase and 2) conclude that Teresa’ enforcement action was barred by the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations found in TEX. FAM. CODE § 9.003(b). Based on this finding and\n\nconclusion, the Court should reverse the trial court’s judgment in all respects and\n\nrender judgment that Teresa take nothing by her enforcement action against Paul.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f                                       Prayer\n\n      Appellant Paul D.

SIMMONS appeared in person and through attorney ofrecord Melvin\n\nGray.\n\n        The making of a record of testimony was made by Lori Dobbins, Official Court Reporter.\n\n        The Court has considered the pleadings and official records on file in this cause and the\n\nevidence and is ofthe opinion that judgment should be rendered for Petitioner.\n\n        The Court specifically finds that a suit to enforce future interest must be brought within two\n\n(2) years of the anniversary of the date the right to the property matures or accrues or the suit is\n\nbarred. The Court finds that the earliest Petitioner TERESA A.

Plaintiff (former wife) and Defendant (former husband) were divorced\n            on June 1, 1987 in New Mexico. Plaintiff was awarded a portion of\n            Defendant's retirement acquired through Defendant's employment\n            with Conoco. Plaintiffs portion was to be paid if, as and when\n            received by husband. Wife's portion was defined in the Divorce.\n     2.     Defendant worked for Conoco for a total of 25 years, from February 12,\n            1979 to 2004.     In 2004, Targa purchased Conoco-Phillips and\n            Defendant continued to work for Targa. While working for Conoco, he\n            was married to Plaintiff for 8 years, 3 months (2179 to 6/1/87).\n     3.     Defendant received $295,500.61 retirement benefits from Conoco\n            employment on 11/1/2004.\n     4.     Defendant used the retirement distribution to pay bills, including a\n            debt payable to Wells Fargo that was secured by a lien on Defendant's\n            homestead.\n     5.     Defendant paid Wells Fargo in August, 2012.\n     6.     Wells Fargo signed a Release of lien on August 29, 2012.\n     7.     Plaintiff learned of this retirement distribution sometime after August\n            2012 when her daughter told her that Defendant was mad at a loan\n            company and paid them with proceeds from a retirement distribution.\n     8.     Plaintiff filed a Notice of Registration of Foreign Decree in Tom Green\n            County Texas District Court on April4, 2013 and then gave notice to\n            Defendant of the Registration and in a note stated \"We've registered\n            this decree in anticipation of having to enforce a portion of that decree\n            regarding your Conoco retirement.\"\n     9.     On April 22, 2013, Defendant filed a response, including affirmative\n            defenses of laches and statute of limitations. Defendant requested a\n            hearing to contest enforcement of the registered order.\n     10.    On April3, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Petition to Enforce the Order.\n\n\n\n\n     Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n                                           52\n\f  11.   Plaintiff has incurred reasonable and necessary attorney fees of\n        $2,600 to collect her share of the retirement and court costs.\n  12.   Plaintiffs share of the retirement account is $48,757.60 based on the\n        formula in the Decree [112 times (Feb 1979 to June 1, 1987 i.e. 8 years\n        3 months) divided by 25 years with the Company (300 months).\n\n\n               Conclusions of Law:\n  1.    Family Code Section 9.003(b) provides:\n        A suit to enforce the division of future property not in existence at the\n        time of the original decree must be filed before the second anniversary\n        of the date the right to the property matures or accrues or the decree\n        becomes final, whichever date is later, or the suit is barred.\n  2.    The earliest Plaintiff learned about the retirement distribution to\n        Defendant was after August 2012.\n  3.    The Statute of Limitations began to run after August 2012.\n  4.    Suit to enforce the future right was filed April2014, within 2 years of\n        Plaintiffs discovery of the distribution.                              '\n  5.    Laches is an equitable remedy to prevent an inequitable result.\n        Defense of laches is denied.\n  6.    The Court awards Plaintiff a Judgment for $48,757.60, plus $2,600\n        attorney fees, all costs of Court and interest as allowed by law.\n\n\n\n\nDate Signed\n                                         /~\n                                         Ben Woodward, Judge Presiding\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of Fact and Conclusions ofLaw\n                                        53\n\fAPPENDIX3\n\f                                               (f\n\n                                                                                                                                                                    ..D\n                                                                                                                                               '87 JUU -t P4 :Qj\n\n\n                            IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF EDDY COUNTY\n                                                              STATE OF NEW MEXICO\n\n  PAUL D.
