(No. 94-8360-CV-\nKLR), Kenneth L. Ryskamp, Judge.\n\nBefore DUBINA and BARKETT, Circuit Judges, and HILL, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n       DUBINA, Circuit Judge:\n\n       Appellant, Mark Bledsoe (\"Bledsoe\") appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nto the Palm Beach County Soil and Water Conservation District (\"District\"), on Bledsoe's claims\n\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. Section 12131 (\"Title II\") and the\n\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 701, et seq. This case involves an issue of first impression\n\nin our circuit: whether Title II of the ADA encompasses employment discrimination. We answer\n\nthe question in the affirmative and, accordingly, we reverse the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Bledsoe was employed as a Resource Technician for the District from January 1988 until his\n\ntermination in October of 1992. In his employment, Bledsoe had to spend a large portion of his time\n\nwalking, surveying, and performing manual labor in the fields. While performing his duties, on\n\fFebruary 26, 1990, Bledsoe sustained an injury to his knee for which he made a claim for workers'\n\ncompensation benefits. Based on the advice of his doctors that he should refrain from excessive\n\nwalking and walking on uneven terrain, Bledsoe requested some form of accommodation from his\n\nsupervisor. In response, the District offered Bledsoe the position of Resource Conservationist, but\n\nhe rejected the offer. In October 1992, the District terminated Bledsoe.\n\n       Subsequent to his termination, Bledsoe settled his workers' compensation case with Palm\n\nBeach County.1 The joint settlement agreement entered into by the parties contained the following\n\npartial release provision:\n\n               As further consideration for the aforementioned payment, the Employee/Claimant\n       agrees and does hereby release, discharge, and surrender any and all claims, whether or not\n       asserted, against the Employer/Carrier or Servicing Agent, or any of its officers, agents,\n       servants, employees, directors, successors, assigns, and any other person or entity so\n       connected to the Employer/Carrier or Servicing Agent, of any nature whatsoever, excepting\n       only (1) future medical pursuant to other provisions of this agreement, or (2) penalties,\n       interest or attorneys' fees which might be due because of failure to pay order approving this\n       Joint Petition within 30 days.\n\nR1-34-Exh. A.\n\n       Bledsoe filed suit on June 24, 1994, against the District and Palm Beach County alleging that\n\nboth of those entities were his \"employer\" within the meaning of Title I of the ADA and the\n\nRehabilitation Act and had violated his rights protected by those acts. Specifically, Bledsoe alleged\n\nthat he had a disability within the meaning of the law, that the defendants had failed to accommodate\n\nhis disability, and that the defendants discharged him as a result of his disability. Palm Beach\n\nCounty filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it was not Bledsoe's \"employer\" for purposes of the\n\n\n\n   1\n    At all relevant times, the District was Bledsoe's employer; however, because the District had\nno more than five employees at a time, it participated in Palm Beach County's insurance plans,\nincluding its workers' compensation plan. For a fee, the County adjusted workers' compensation\nclaims made against the District. Therefore, Palm Beach County was the District's workers'\ncompensation carrier and the party with whom Bledsoe settled his workers' compensation claim.\n\fclaims and that it had been released from the claims by virtue of Bledsoe's partial release of his\n\nworkers' compensation benefits. After consideration, the district court determined that Palm Beach\n\nCounty was not Bledsoe's employer and, therefore, summary judgment should be entered for it on\n\nall claims. Bledsoe has not appealed the district court's disposition that the County was not his\n\nemployer.\n\n       The litigation continued against the District. Because the District alone did not have the\n\nrequisite number of employees to effect coverage under Title I of the ADA,2 Bledsoe sought leave\n\nto amend the complaint to bring his claim under Title II, and the district court granted leave. The\n\nDistrict filed a motion for summary judgment arguing first that Title II of the ADA does not apply\n\nto discrimination in employment and, second, that the partial release in Bledsoe's joint settlement\n\nagreement with the County released his claims against the District. Bledsoe opposed the motion.\n\nThe district court entered summary judgment for the District on both Bledsoe's ADA and\n\nRehabilitation Act claims. Bledsoe then perfected this appeal.\n\n                                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n       Bledsoe raises two issues for our review: (1) whether the district court properly concluded\n\nthat the workers' compensation release bars Bledsoe's federal claims of employment discrimination;\n\nand (2) whether the district court properly determined that Title II of the ADA does not apply to\n\ndiscrimination in employment. We review the district court's order granting summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Parks v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., 43 F.3d 609, 612 (11th Cir.1995). After conducting our\n\nreview, we conclude that the district court improperly found that the workers' compensation release\n\nbarred Bledsoe's federal claims of employment discrimination and that Title II does not encompass\n\n\n   2\n   The term \"employer\" in Title I is defined as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting\ncommerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar\nweeks in the current or preceding calendar year....\" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5).\n\femployment discrimination.\n\nA. Workers' Compensation Release\n\n       In its determination that the workers' compensation release barred Bledsoe's ADA and\n\nRehabilitation Act claims, the district court relied on F.M. v. Palm Beach County, 912 F.Supp. 514\n\n(S.D.Fla.1995), aff'd F.M. v. County Comm'rs, 84 F.3d 438 (11th Cir.1996)(Table). On appeal,\n\nBledsoe contends that the district court erred in relying on F.M. v. Palm Beach County. He argues\n\nthat the issue should have been analyzed under this circuit's decision in Puentes v. United Parcel\n\nService, Inc., 86 F.3d 196 (11th Cir.1996). Bledsoe is correct.\n\n        The Supreme Court has stated that an employee can waive his \"cause of action under Title\n\nVII as part of a voluntary settlement agreement\" if \"the employee's consent to the settlement was\n\nvoluntary and knowing.\" Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 52 n. 15, 94 S.Ct. 1011,\n\n1022 n. 15, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). The same principles should be equally applicable to waiver of\n\nrights under Title II of the ADA. See Rivera-Flores v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Caribbean, 112 F.3d\n\n9 (1st Cir.1997). The waiver of such remedial rights, however, \"must be closely scrutinized,\" and\n\na court must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the release is knowing\n\nand voluntary. Puentes v. United Parcel Service, 86 F.3d at 198.\n\n       In Puentes, the plaintiffs, at the time of their terminations, were offered substantial severance\n\npackages and the ability to resign \"for personal reasons\" on the condition that they execute\n\nunambiguous release agreements waiving all employment discrimination claims arising out of their\n\nterminations. Both plaintiffs executed the agreements, but later filed suit against UPS alleging racial\n\nand national origin discrimination. UPS moved for summary judgment, which the district court\n\ngranted. On appeal, this court reversed, concluding that a jury should decide whether the releases\n\nwere knowingly and voluntarily executed.\n\f       The Puentes court explained that the following factors bear on whether a release is knowing\n\nand voluntary:\n\n       the plaintiff's education and business experience; the amount of time the plaintiff considered\n       the agreement before signing it; the clarity of the agreement; the plaintiff's opportunity to\n       consult with an attorney; the employer's encouragement or discouragement of consultation\n       with an attorney; and the consideration given in exchange for the waiver when compared\n       with the benefits to which the employee was already entitled.\n\n86 F.3d at 198 (quoting Beadle v. City of Tampa, 42 F.3d 633, 635 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 515 U.S.\n\n1152, 115 S.Ct. 2600, 132 L.Ed.2d 846 (1995)). When reviewing these factors in Puentes, the court\n\ndetermined that the plaintiffs did not have sufficient time to consider their release agreements and\n\nneither plaintiff had consulted with an attorney. The court also noted that neither plaintiff had any\n\nrole in deciding the terms of the agreement; the plaintiffs were simply handed printed forms. 86\n\nF.3d at 199. These factors raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiffs voluntarily\n\nand knowingly executed the release agreements. Accordingly, the issue could not be resolved by\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n        The factors set forth in Puentes should have been considered by the district court in this\n\ncase. The district court should not have summarily adopted a decision from another case, even\n\nthough it dealt with the exact same release form. Each factor should be independently analyzed.\n\nIn applying the Puentes factors, we conclude that a jury question exists about whether Bledsoe\n\nvoluntarily and knowingly released ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. The language of the release\n\nindicates that Bledsoe was only settling his claim for wage loss benefits under the workers'\n\ncompensation law. There is nothing in the release that suggests or mentions a waiver of federal\n\ndiscrimination claims. Additionally, there was no evidence in the record of any consideration given\n\nto Bledsoe in exchange for his allegedly waiving his rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation\n\nAct. Moreover, Bledsoe and his counsel provided affidavits to the district court stating that the only\n\fmatters released were benefits for wage loss available under the workers' compensation law, thus\n\ncreating an issue of fact as to what was released. The district court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on this claim.\n\nB. Title II of the ADA\n\n         The district court held that Title II of the ADA does not encompass employment\n\ndiscrimination. Bledsoe3 urges this court to reverse and join several other courts which have held\n\nthat Title II does encompass employment discrimination.4 Our circuit has not squarely addressed\n\nthe issue, but two of our recent decisions have assumed or implied that Title II creates a cause of\n\naction for employment discrimination. See Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522,\n\n1528-29 (11th Cir.1997); McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1073 (11th Cir.1996),\n\ncert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1819, 137 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1997). Our review of the statutory\n\nlanguage of Title II, the Department of Justice's (\"DOJ\") regulations, our circuit's reference to the\n\nissue, and other courts' resolution of the issue, persuade us that Title II of the ADA does encompass\n\npublic employment discrimination.\n\n\n\n   3\n   Joining Bledsoe's position are the United States Department of Justice, the National\nEmployment Lawyers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union, which all filed\namicus briefs with the court.\n   4\n    See e.g., Doe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1264-65 (4th\nCir.1995); Dominguez v. City of Council Bluffs, Iowa, 974 F.Supp. 732, 736-37 (S.D.Iowa\n1997); Hernandez v. City of Hartford, 959 F.Supp. 125, 133 (D.Conn.1997); Davoll v. Webb,\n943 F.Supp. 1289, 1297 (D.Colo.1996); Wagner v. Texas A & M Univ., 939 F.Supp. 1297, 1309\n(S.D.Tex.1996); Graboski v. Guiliani, 937 F.Supp. 258, 267-69 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Silk v. City of\nChicago, No. 95C0143, (N.D.Ill. June 7, 1996); Lundstedt v. City of Miami, 5 A.D. Cases 568\n(S.D.Fla. Oct.11, 1995); Bruton v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Authority, Civ.A.No. 94-CV-3111,\n1994 WL 470277 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 19, 1994); Ethridge v. State of Alabama, 847 F.Supp. 903, 905-\n06 (M.D.Ala.1993); Eisfelder v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 847 F.Supp. 78, 83\n(W.D.Mich.1993); Finley v. Giacobbe, 827 F.Supp. 215, 219-20 (S.D.N.Y.1993); Petersen v.\nUniversity of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 818 F.Supp. 1276, 1278 (W.D.Wis.1993); Bell v. Retirement\nBd. of Firemen's Annuity & Benefit Fund, No. 92C5197, (N.D.Ill. Oct. 6, 1993).\n\f1. The statutory language\n\n       The ADA was implemented \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the\n\nelimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). In\n\npassing the ADA, Congress recognized that \"society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals\n\nwith disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals\n\nwith disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).\n\nCongress further recognized that disabled individuals face extraordinary barriers and discrimination\n\nby outright intentional segregation and often have \"no legal recourse to redress such discrimination.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(4) and (5). Moreover, in enacting the ADA, Congress hoped to increase\n\nemployment opportunities for disabled people through prevention of employment discrimination.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3), (8), and (9).\n\n       The provision of Title II allegedly violated by the District in this action provides:\n\n               Subject to the provisions of this [title], no qualified individual with a disability shall,\n       by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of\n       the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by\n       any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \"Public entity\" is defined to include \"(A) any State or local government; [and]\n\n(B) any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or\n\nlocal government;....\" 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A) & (B).\n\n       The statutory language used by Congress in the creation of Title II is brief. Extensive\n\nlegislative commentary regarding the applicability of Title II to employment discrimination,\n\nhowever, is so pervasive as to belie any contention that Title II does not apply to employment\n\nactions. The Report of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee stated, \"[i]n\n\nthe area of employment, title II incorporates the duty set forth in the regulations for Sections 501,\n\n503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to provide a \"reasonable accommodation' that does not\n\fconstitute an \"undue hardship.' \" See H.R.Rep. No. 101-485(III), at 50 (1990), reprinted in 1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 473. In explaining the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title II, the Report\n\nnoted that:\n\n       The Committee intends, however, that the forms of discrimination prohibited by section 202\n       [codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12132] be identical to those set out in the applicable provisions of\n       titles I and III of this legislation.... In addition, activities which do not fit into the\n       employment or public accommodations context are governed by the analogous section 504\n       regulations.\n\nH.R.Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 367. The Report\n\nfurther notes: \"The purpose of title II is to continue to break down barriers to the integrated\n\nparticipation of people with disabilities in all aspects of community life. The Committee intends that\n\ntitle II work in the same manner as Section 504.\" 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 472-73.\n\n       It is significant that Congress intended Title II to work in the same manner as Section 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act, because Section 504 was so focused on employment discrimination that\n\nCongress enacted subsequent legislation to clarify that Section 504 applied to other forms of\n\ndiscrimination in addition to employment discrimination. The first Supreme Court case to consider\n\nSection 504, Consolidated Rail v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 104 S.Ct. 1248, 79 L.Ed.2d 568 (1984),\n\nwas an employment discrimination case. The Court stated:\n\n       Among [the] purposes [of the Rehabilitation Act] as originally stated, were to \"promote and\n       expand employment opportunities in the public and private sectors for handicapped\n       individuals and to place such individuals in employment.\" 29 U.S.C. § 701(8)....¶ Section\n       504 neither refers explicitly to § 604 nor contains analogous limiting language; rather, that\n       section prohibits discrimination against the handicapped under \"any program or activity\n       receiving Federal financial assistance.\" And it is unquestionable that the section was\n       intended to reach employment discrimination.\n\nId. at 626-632, 104 S.Ct. at 1250-53 (emphasis in original).\n\n       Part of the language of Title II prohibits public entities from excluding disabled individuals\n\nfrom \"services, programs, or activities\" or denying them the benefits of those services, programs,\n\for activities. The district court in this case focused on the meaning of the words \"services, programs,\n\nor activities.\" Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Soil and Water Conservation Dist., 942 F.Supp. 1439, 1443\n\n(S.D.Fla.1996). The district court found that these words, \"understood as a whole, focus [ ] on a\n\npublic [ ] entity's outputs rather than its imputs [sic].\" Id. The court characterized public\n\nemployment as \"an imput [sic]\" that enables a public entity \"to produce desired outputs, such as\n\nparks and schools.\" Id. at 1444. The court's analysis ignored the prohibition in the final clause of\n\nthe section, which protects qualified individuals with a disability from being \"subjected to\n\ndiscrimination by any such entity,\" and is not tied directly to the \"services, programs, or activities\"\n\nof the public entity. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. As the Second Circuit found in Innovative Health Systems,\n\nInc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 44-45 (2d Cir.1997), \"the language of Title II's\n\nantidiscrimination provision does not limit the ADA's coverage to conduct that occurs in the\n\n\"programs, services, or activities' of [a public entity]. Rather, it is a catch-all phrase that prohibits\n\nall discrimination by a public entity, regardless of the context,....\" Accordingly, employment\n\ncoverage is clear from the language and structure of Title II.\n\n2. DOJ regulations\n\n        The DOJ regulations also support the position that Title II encompasses public employment\n\ndiscrimination.5\n\n\n\n   5\n    The district court noted its familiarity with the principle that \"considerable weight should be\naccorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to\nadminister.\" Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). However, the district court found that the\nplain language of the ADA, when read as a whole, does not support a cause of action for\nemployment discrimination under Title II, and, therefore, Chevron deference was not applicable\nin this case. \"[T]he Court does not believe that the conflicting legislative history sufficiently\nobfuscates the statute to create a vacuum of meaning for the Justice Department to fill.\" Bledsoe,\n942 F.Supp. at 1449. The court concluded that when the language of the statute is plain,\nadministrative interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference. Id.\n\f       Congress specifically provided in the ADA statute that the DOJ should write regulations\n\nimplementing Title II's prohibition against discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12134. The House Judiciary\n\nCommittee Report provided:\n\n               Unlike the other titles in this Act, title II does not list all of the forms of\n       discrimination that the title is intended to prohibit. Thus, the purpose of this section is to\n       direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the forms of discrimination\n       prohibited.\n\nH.R.Rep. 101-485(III), at 52 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 475.\n\n       In promulgating regulations pertinent to Title II, the Attorney General created a specific\n\nsubpart in the Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\") addressing employment discrimination by\n\npublic entities. These regulations state:\n\n              (a) No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be\n       subjected to discrimination in employment under any service, program, or activity conducted\n       by a public entity.\n\n               (b)(1) For purposes of this part, the requirements of title I of the Act ... apply to\n       employment in any service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity if that public\n       entity is also subject to the jurisdiction of title I [i.e. employs fifteen or more employees].\n\n               (b)(2) For the purposes of this part, the requirements of section 504 of the\n       Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as established by the regulations of the Department of Justice\n       in 28 CFR part 41, as those requirements pertain to employment, apply to employment in\n       any service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity if that public entity is not also\n       subject to the jurisdiction of title I.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 35.140.\n\n        There has been no modification to the regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\n\nRather, in 1997, the United States Senate unanimously gave its consent to the printing in the\n\nCongressional Record of the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance regulation adopting the\n\nAttorney General's interpretation of Title II. See 143 Cong. Rec. S30-31 (January 7, 1997).6 Also,\n\n\n   6\n   We note, however, that these regulations do not become effective until they are approved by\nCongress and published in the Congressional Record. See 2 U.S.C.A. § 1384(d)(3).\n\fas this court has stated, \"[C]ongress is deemed to know the executive and judicial gloss given to\n\ncertain language and thus adopts the existing interpretation unless it affirmatively acts to change the\n\nmeaning.\" Florida National Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 699 F.2d 1082, 1087\n\n(11th Cir.1983).\n\n       Under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844,\n\n104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), \"considerable weight should be accorded to an\n\nexecutive department's construction of a statutory scheme,\" unless the regulations are \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" The DOJ regulations provide clearly that Title II\n\nencompasses employment actions against public entities. The regulations are neither \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" Id. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. Thus, we cannot\n\nignore the DOJ's reasonable construction of statutory language.\n\n3. Our court's reference to the issue\n\n       In McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068 (11th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S.\n\n----, 117 S.Ct. 1819, 137 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1997), our court addressed the question whether a plaintiff\n\nsuing under the ADA can recover for discrimination without showing that his disability was the sole\n\ncause for the adverse employment action taken against him. We answered the question in the\n\naffirmative. In discussing the issue, we noted that \"[t]he stated purpose of the ADA is \"to provide\n\na clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals\n\nwith disabilities.' \" 99 F.3d at 1073, quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). We acknowledged that Title\n\nI of the ADA applies to the private sector and provides for the elimination of disability-based\n\ndiscrimination.    We then stated that \"Title II of the ADA, which applies to public sector\n\nemployment, contains a parallel provision.\" Id. (emphasis added). Later, we again assumed that\n\nTitle II covered employment: \"Title II (the public sector title).\" Id. at 1074. Thus, without directly\n\fdiscussing the issue with which this court is presently faced, our court has assumed that Title II\n\ncovers public employment discrimination.\n\n       Additionally, in Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522 (11th Cir.1997), we\n\naddressed the question whether claims brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA involving events that\n\noccurred prior to the effective date of Title I are actionable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act\n\nof 1973. In discussing this issue, we noted the language of Title II, the federal regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant to the ADA, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\")\n\nguide. 112 F.3d at 1528-29. The court then determined that \"Title II thus incorporates by reference\n\nthe substantive, detailed regulations prohibiting discrimination against disabled individuals\n\ncontained in Title I.\" Id. at 1529. We further noted:\n\n       The above regulations suggest that the provisions of Title II extending the protections\n       afforded to employees in the private sector under Title I to state and local government\n       workers became effective only when Title I went into effect. As explicitly described in the\n       EEOC manual, the Rehabilitation Act provided a remedy for discrimination in public\n       employment prior to the effective date of Title I. We conclude that Title II of the ADA did\n       not become effective until the date on which Title I became effective, July 26, 1992, and,\n       prior to that date, a plaintiff's remedy for discrimination under Title II of the ADA was the\n       Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nId. Thus, the court implicitly determined that Title II was the \"new replacement\" for the\n\nRehabilitation Act, which is what the legislative history indicates.\n\n       Although not decisions of our court, Lundstedt v. City of Miami, Cases 568 (S.D.Fla. Oct.11,\n\n1995), and Ethridge v. State of Alabama, 847 F.Supp. 903 (M.D.Ala.1993), two district court\n\ndecisions from within our circuit, held that Title II clearly encompasses employment discrimination\n\nby public entities. 5 A.D. Cases at 572-74, 847 F.Supp. at 906. The district court in Ethridge found\n\nthat although a plain reading of Title II does not reveal whether it covers employment\n\ndiscrimination, the legislative history of and regulations promulgated under Title II make clear that\n\nthe section prohibits employment discrimination by public entities on the basis of disability. The\n\fcourt noted that the primary purpose of Title II was to extend the reach of Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act and that Section 504 \"clearly applies to employment discrimination.\" 847\n\nF.Supp. at 906, citing Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 104 S.Ct. 1248, 79\n\nL.Ed.2d 568 (1984). The Ethridge court also discussed the House Report addressing Title II and\n\nthe regulations implementing Title II to find that Title II covers employment discrimination.\n\n        Additionally, the Ethridge court noted the difference in the application of the exhaustion\n\nrequirement which is mandatory in Title I but not in Title II of the ADA.7 The court found that\n\nalthough Title I requires exhaustion, Title II does not because it \"incorporates the enforcement\n\nprocedures of the Rehabilitation Act, ... which do not require exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nfor non-federal employees.\" 847 F.Supp. at 907. \"An analysis of Title II regulations further makes\n\nclear that, while resort to administrative remedies is optional, it is not required.\" Id. The court\n\nreferenced the regulations, which plainly state that exhaustion is not required. See 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.172, Appendix A. We agree with this analysis and note that it is generally presumed that\n\n\n   7\n    The district court in this case expressed great concern in the inconsistency in the exhaustion\nrequirement if the court found that Title II covered employment discrimination. \"Acceptance of\nthe \"no exhaustion rule,' when coupled with the slighting of Title II's plain meaning and the\nredundancy of Titles I and II, renders the entire statutory framework a monstrous distortion.\"\n942 F.Supp. at 1445. The court further stated that:\n\n               The statute the majority of the district courts (and the Justice Department) give us\n               is completely bewildering: Both Title I and Titles II apply to employment,\n               although Title II says nothing at all on the subject and Title I lays out a\n               comprehensive scheme to deal with employment issues; Title I says an employer\n               must hire 15 employees to be sued for employment discrimination, but you can\n               get around this under Title II if your employer is an arm of the State; Title I says\n               you must exhaust administrative remedies, but you can ignore this requirement\n               too if you are employed by the State. If this is really what Congress meant, then\n               the ADA surely must rank as one of the great drafting debacles of recent times.\n               Unwilling to impute such sheer ineptitude to Congress, the Court must part\n               company with the current consensus.\n\n       Id. at 1445-46.\n\fCongress acts intentionally and purposely where \" \"it includes particular language in one section of\n\na statute but omits it in another.' \" See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296,\n\n300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th\n\nCir.1972)).\n\n4. Other courts' resolution of the issue\n\n       The only other circuit to consider this issue did not really discuss it. The court allowed a\n\nplaintiff to proceed against the employer/hospital under both the Rehabilitation Act and Title II. See\n\nDoe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261 (4th Cir.1995). The court found\n\nthat both Title II and the Rehabilitation Act \"prohibit discrimination against an otherwise qualified\n\nindividual with a disability.\" Id. at 1264. The court noted that the parties did not dispute that the\n\nMedical System was \"a \"public entity' subject to the provisions of Title II of the ADA.\" Id. n. 8.\n\nAccordingly, Doe does not provide much guidance on the issue before us for consideration.\n\n       In Wagner v. Texas A & M University, 939 F.Supp. 1297 (S.D.Tex.1996), the court\n\ndetermined that a tenured professor could bring a Title II claim against the University when he was\n\nnot rehired to his same position following a medical disability leave. In so finding, the court found\n\nthat Title II obtains its remedies from the Rehabilitation Act, which does not require exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies before filing suit. The court relied upon Ethridge in making its conclusion.\n\nIn its discussion, the court noted that Title II encompasses employment actions. 939 F.Supp. at\n\n1310. The court also discussed the policy anomaly created when Title II does not require exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies. The court stated that Title I and Title II create \"separate and distinct\n\nenforceable rights.\" Id. \"Title I addresses primarily the rights of disabled individuals in workplaces,\n\nwhile Title II addresses the rights of disabled citizens vis-a-vis the government.\" Id. The court stated\n\nthat this inconsistency \"is undesirable from a policy standpoint;\" however, given the DOJ's\n\fregulatory posture, the court would \"not fill the gaps in the ADA in an attempt to effectuate a\n\npurported Congressional intent that is not entirely evident.\" Id. See also Hernandez v. City of\n\nHartford, 959 F.Supp. 125 (D.Conn.1997); Graboski v. Guiliani, 937 F.Supp. 258 (S.D.N.Y.1996);\n\nSilk v. City of Chicago, No. 95C0143, (N.D.Ill. June 7, 1996).\n\n       In Dertz v. City of Chicago, 912 F.Supp. 319 (N.D.Ill.1995), the court discussed whether\n\nplaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a claim under Title II of the ADA.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Dertz were former police officers for the City of Chicago who had been placed on\n\nmedical leave and were not allowed to return to their former positions. The plaintiffs filed suit under\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act and Titles I and II of the ADA. The court relied on the district court's decision\n\nin Petersen v. Univ. of Wisconsin Bd. of Regents, 818 F.Supp. 1276 (W.D.Wis.1993), to find that\n\nthe procedural requirements of Title I do not apply to Title II plaintiffs. Dertz, 912 F.Supp. at 324-\n\n25. Because the court found that the plaintiffs were not required to exhaust their administrative\n\nremedies under Title II, their actions were allowed to proceed. Id. at 325. See also Finley v.\n\nGiacobbe, 827 F.Supp. 215, 219 (S.D.N.Y.1993).\n\n       The District cites other district court cases which have decided this issue as did the district\n\ncourt in this case. See e.g., Decker v. University of Houston, 970 F.Supp. 575 (S.D.Tex.1997);\n\nIskander v. Rodeo Sanitary District, No. C-94-0479-SC, (N.D.Cal. Feb.7, 1995), aff'd, 121 F.3d 715\n\n(9th Cir.1997)(Table). However, in light of the foregoing discussion, these cases are not persuasive.\n\nEven the district judge in this case noted that he was \"swimming against the current,\" 942 F.Supp.\n\nat 1442, in deciding that Title II does not encompass employment discrimination claims.\n\n       In conclusion, we hold that Title II does state a cause of action for employment\n\ndiscrimination and reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n       REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f                         HILL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring specially:\n\n       I concur with reluctance.\n\n       In Part IIA, we conclude that the meaning and consequence of an unambiguous written\n\nrelease are subject to dispute, variance and avoidance because we, acting in loco parentis, find the\n\nadult parties to the contract in need of our patronage. Although troublesome, we apparently have\n\nsuch a role. See Puentes v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 86 F.3d 196 (11th Cir.1996).\n\n       In Part IIB, we find that Title II of the ADA (the Act) is carefully drafted to obfuscate.1\n\nCongress could have said \"discrimination in employment\" if it had wanted to do so. Here, however,\n\nit merely forbids the exclusion of qualified individuals \"from ... participat[ing] in or be[ing] denied\n\nthe benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity\" by reason of a disability.\n\n       The district judge concluded that the Act forbids discrimination vis-à-vis the \"output of these\n\npublic entities.\" See Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Soil and Water Conservation District, 942 F.Supp. 1439\n\n(S.D.Fla.1996). If a constituent is angered by the district judge's interpretation or our holding today,\n\nhis or her Congressperson can say \"That's not what we passed. I would never have voted for that!\n\nThat's just the work of those activist judges.\"\n\n       So be it. The legislative power is vested in Congress. By concluding what Congress has\n\ndone, are we legislating? I hope not.\n\n       With a tip of the hat to the district judge, I reluctantly conclude that the flow of precedent\n\nis too strong for him or for us to swim upstream, and I\n\n       CONCUR.\n\n\n\n   1\n    The Act resembles the campaign address of a candidate appearing before an audience that\nwas split on a key issue. The candidate observed, \"Some of my friends are in favor of this\nproposition; some of my friends are against it! As for me, I stand four square behind my\nfriends!\"\n\f\f",

Section 12131 (\"Title II\") and the\n\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 701, et seq. This case involves an issue of first impression\n\nin our circuit: whether Title II of the ADA encompasses employment discrimination. We answer\n\nthe question in the affirmative and, accordingly, we reverse the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Bledsoe was employed as a Resource Technician for the District from January 1988 until his\n\ntermination in October of 1992. In his employment, Bledsoe had to spend a large portion of his time\n\nwalking, surveying, and performing manual labor in the fields. While performing his duties, on\n\fFebruary 26, 1990, Bledsoe sustained an injury to his knee for which he made a claim for workers'\n\ncompensation benefits. Based on the advice of his doctors that he should refrain from excessive\n\nwalking and walking on uneven terrain, Bledsoe requested some form of accommodation from his\n\nsupervisor. In response, the District offered Bledsoe the position of Resource Conservationist, but\n\nhe rejected the offer. In October 1992, the District terminated Bledsoe.\n\n       Subsequent to his termination, Bledsoe settled his workers' compensation case with Palm\n\nBeach County.1 The joint settlement agreement entered into by the parties contained the following\n\npartial release provision:\n\n               As further consideration for the aforementioned payment, the Employee/Claimant\n       agrees and does hereby release, discharge, and surrender any and all claims, whether or not\n       asserted, against the Employer/Carrier or Servicing Agent, or any of its officers, agents,\n       servants, employees, directors, successors, assigns, and any other person or entity so\n       connected to the Employer/Carrier or Servicing Agent, of any nature whatsoever, excepting\n       only (1) future medical pursuant to other provisions of this agreement, or (2) penalties,\n       interest or attorneys' fees which might be due because of failure to pay order approving this\n       Joint Petition within 30 days.\n\nR1-34-Exh. A.\n\n       Bledsoe filed suit on June 24, 1994, against the District and Palm Beach County alleging that\n\nboth of those entities were his \"employer\" within the meaning of Title I of the ADA and the\n\nRehabilitation Act and had violated his rights protected by those acts. Specifically, Bledsoe alleged\n\nthat he had a disability within the meaning of the law, that the defendants had failed to accommodate\n\nhis disability, and that the defendants discharged him as a result of his disability. Palm Beach\n\nCounty filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it was not Bledsoe's \"employer\" for purposes of the\n\n\n\n   1\n    At all relevant times, the District was Bledsoe's employer; however, because the District had\nno more than five employees at a time, it participated in Palm Beach County's insurance plans,\nincluding its workers' compensation plan. For a fee, the County adjusted workers' compensation\nclaims made against the District. Therefore, Palm Beach County was the District's workers'\ncompensation carrier and the party with whom Bledsoe settled his workers' compensation claim.\n\fclaims and that it had been released from the claims by virtue of Bledsoe's partial release of his\n\nworkers' compensation benefits. After consideration, the district court determined that Palm Beach\n\nCounty was not Bledsoe's employer and, therefore, summary judgment should be entered for it on\n\nall claims. Bledsoe has not appealed the district court's disposition that the County was not his\n\nemployer.\n\n       The litigation continued against the District. Because the District alone did not have the\n\nrequisite number of employees to effect coverage under Title I of the ADA,2 Bledsoe sought leave\n\nto amend the complaint to bring his claim under Title II, and the district court granted leave. The\n\nDistrict filed a motion for summary judgment arguing first that Title II of the ADA does not apply\n\nto discrimination in employment and, second, that the partial release in Bledsoe's joint settlement\n\nagreement with the County released his claims against the District. Bledsoe opposed the motion.\n\nThe district court entered summary judgment for the District on both Bledsoe's ADA and\n\nRehabilitation Act claims. Bledsoe then perfected this appeal.\n\n                                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n       Bledsoe raises two issues for our review: (1) whether the district court properly concluded\n\nthat the workers' compensation release bars Bledsoe's federal claims of employment discrimination;\n\nand (2) whether the district court properly determined that Title II of the ADA does not apply to\n\ndiscrimination in employment. We review the district court's order granting summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Parks v.

After conducting our\n\nreview, we conclude that the district court improperly found that the workers' compensation release\n\nbarred Bledsoe's federal claims of employment discrimination and that Title II does not encompass\n\n\n   2\n   The term \"employer\" in Title I is defined as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting\ncommerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar\nweeks in the current or preceding calendar year....\" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5).\n\femployment discrimination.\n\nA. Workers' Compensation Release\n\n       In its determination that the workers' compensation release barred Bledsoe's ADA and\n\nRehabilitation Act claims, the district court relied on F.M. v. Palm Beach County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

On appeal,\n\nBledsoe contends that the district court erred in relying on F.M. v. Palm Beach County. He argues\n\nthat the issue should have been analyzed under this circuit's decision in Puentes v. United Parcel\n\nService, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70950\"><a href=\"/opinion/70950/puentes-v-united-parcel-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1996). Bledsoe is correct.\n\n        The Supreme Court has stated that an employee can waive his \"cause of action under Title\n\nVII as part of a voluntary settlement agreement\" if \"the employee's consent to the settlement was\n\nvoluntary and knowing.\" Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108961\"><a href=\"/opinion/108961/alexander-v-gardner-denver-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 n. 15, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108961\"><a href=\"/opinion/108961/alexander-v-gardner-denver-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The waiver of such remedial rights, however, \"must be closely scrutinized,\" and\n\na court must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the release is knowing\n\nand voluntary. Puentes v. United Parcel Service, 86 F.3d at 198.\n\n       In Puentes, the plaintiffs, at the time of their terminations, were offered substantial severance\n\npackages and the ability to resign \"for personal reasons\" on the condition that they execute\n\nunambiguous release agreements waiving all employment discrimination claims arising out of their\n\nterminations. Both plaintiffs executed the agreements, but later filed suit against UPS alleging racial\n\nand national origin discrimination. UPS moved for summary judgment, which the district court\n\ngranted. On appeal, this court reversed, concluding that a jury should decide whether the releases\n\nwere knowingly and voluntarily executed.\n\f       The Puentes court explained that the following factors bear on whether a release is knowing\n\nand voluntary:\n\n       the plaintiff's education and business experience; the amount of time the plaintiff considered\n       the agreement before signing it; the clarity of the agreement; the plaintiff's opportunity to\n       consult with an attorney; the employer's encouragement or discouragement of consultation\n       with an attorney; and the consideration given in exchange for the waiver when compared\n       with the benefits to which the employee was already entitled.\n\n86 F.3d at 198 (quoting Beadle v.

When reviewing these factors in Puentes, the court\n\ndetermined that the plaintiffs did not have sufficient time to consider their release agreements and\n\nneither plaintiff had consulted with an attorney. The court also noted that neither plaintiff had any\n\nrole in deciding the terms of the agreement; the plaintiffs were simply handed printed forms. 86\n\nF.3d at 199. These factors raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiffs voluntarily\n\nand knowingly executed the release agreements. Accordingly, the issue could not be resolved by\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n        The factors set forth in Puentes should have been considered by the district court in this\n\ncase. The district court should not have summarily adopted a decision from another case, even\n\nthough it dealt with the exact same release form. Each factor should be independently analyzed.\n\nIn applying the Puentes factors, we conclude that a jury question exists about whether Bledsoe\n\nvoluntarily and knowingly released ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. The language of the release\n\nindicates that Bledsoe was only settling his claim for wage loss benefits under the workers'\n\ncompensation law. There is nothing in the release that suggests or mentions a waiver of federal\n\ndiscrimination claims. Additionally, there was no evidence in the record of any consideration given\n\nto Bledsoe in exchange for his allegedly waiving his rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation\n\nAct. Moreover, Bledsoe and his counsel provided affidavits to the district court stating that the only\n\fmatters released were benefits for wage loss available under the workers' compensation law, thus\n\ncreating an issue of fact as to what was released. The district court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on this claim.\n\nB. Title II of the ADA\n\n         The district court held that Title II of the ADA does not encompass employment\n\ndiscrimination. Bledsoe3 urges this court to reverse and join several other courts which have held\n\nthat Title II does encompass employment discrimination.4 Our circuit has not squarely addressed\n\nthe issue, but two of our recent decisions have assumed or implied that Title II creates a cause of\n\naction for employment discrimination.

The statutory language\n\n       The ADA was implemented \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the\n\nelimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). In\n\npassing the ADA, Congress recognized that \"society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals\n\nwith disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals\n\nwith disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).\n\nCongress further recognized that disabled individuals face extraordinary barriers and discrimination\n\nby outright intentional segregation and often have \"no legal recourse to redress such discrimination.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(4) and (5). Moreover, in enacting the ADA, Congress hoped to increase\n\nemployment opportunities for disabled people through prevention of employment discrimination.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3), (8), and (9).\n\n       The provision of Title II allegedly violated by the District in this action provides:\n\n               Subject to the provisions of this [title], no qualified individual with a disability shall,\n       by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of\n       the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by\n       any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \"Public entity\" is defined to include \"(A) any State or local government; [and]\n\n(B) any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or\n\nlocal government;....\" 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A) & (B).\n\n       The statutory language used by Congress in the creation of Title II is brief. Extensive\n\nlegislative commentary regarding the applicability of Title II to employment discrimination,\n\nhowever, is so pervasive as to belie any contention that Title II does not apply to employment\n\nactions. The Report of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee stated, \"[i]n\n\nthe area of employment, title II incorporates the duty set forth in the regulations for Sections 501,\n\n503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to provide a \"reasonable accommodation' that does not\n\fconstitute an \"undue hardship.' \" See H.R.Rep. No. 101-485(III), at 50 (1990), reprinted in 1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 473. In explaining the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title II, the Report\n\nnoted that:\n\n       The Committee intends, however, that the forms of discrimination prohibited by section 202\n       [codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12132] be identical to those set out in the applicable provisions of\n       titles I and III of this legislation.... In addition, activities which do not fit into the\n       employment or public accommodations context are governed by the analogous section 504\n       regulations.\n\nH.R.Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 367. The Report\n\nfurther notes: \"The purpose of title II is to continue to break down barriers to the integrated\n\nparticipation of people with disabilities in all aspects of community life. The Committee intends that\n\ntitle II work in the same manner as Section 504.\" 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 472-73.\n\n       It is significant that Congress intended Title II to work in the same manner as Section 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act, because Section 504 was so focused on employment discrimination that\n\nCongress enacted subsequent legislation to clarify that Section 504 applied to other forms of\n\ndiscrimination in addition to employment discrimination.

The district court in this case focused on the meaning of the words \"services, programs,\n\nor activities.\" Bledsoe v.

The court characterized public\n\nemployment as \"an imput [sic]\" that enables a public entity \"to produce desired outputs, such as\n\nparks and schools.\" Id. at 1444. The court's analysis ignored the prohibition in the final clause of\n\nthe section, which protects qualified individuals with a disability from being \"subjected to\n\ndiscrimination by any such entity,\" and is not tied directly to the \"services, programs, or activities\"\n\nof the public entity. 42 U.S.C. § 12132.

However, the district court found that the\nplain language of the ADA, when read as a whole, does not support a cause of action for\nemployment discrimination under Title II, and, therefore, Chevron deference was not applicable\nin this case. \"[T]he Court does not believe that the conflicting legislative history sufficiently\nobfuscates the statute to create a vacuum of meaning for the Justice Department to fill.\" Bledsoe,\n942 F.Supp. at 1449. The court concluded that when the language of the statute is plain,\nadministrative interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference. Id.\n\f       Congress specifically provided in the ADA statute that the DOJ should write regulations\n\nimplementing Title II's prohibition against discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12134. The House Judiciary\n\nCommittee Report provided:\n\n               Unlike the other titles in this Act, title II does not list all of the forms of\n       discrimination that the title is intended to prohibit. Thus, the purpose of this section is to\n       direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the forms of discrimination\n       prohibited.\n\nH.R.Rep. 101-485(III), at 52 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 475.\n\n       In promulgating regulations pertinent to Title II, the Attorney General created a specific\n\nsubpart in the Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\") addressing employment discrimination by\n\npublic entities. These regulations state:\n\n              (a) No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be\n       subjected to discrimination in employment under any service, program, or activity conducted\n       by a public entity.\n\n               (b)(1) For purposes of this part, the requirements of title I of the Act ... apply to\n       employment in any service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity if that public\n       entity is also subject to the jurisdiction of title I [i.e. employs fifteen or more employees].\n\n               (b)(2) For the purposes of this part, the requirements of section 504 of the\n       Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as established by the regulations of the Department of Justice\n       in 28 CFR part 41, as those requirements pertain to employment, apply to employment in\n       any service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity if that public entity is not also\n       subject to the jurisdiction of title I.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 35.140.\n\n        There has been no modification to the regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\n\nRather, in 1997, the United States Senate unanimously gave its consent to the printing in the\n\nCongressional Record of the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance regulation adopting the\n\nAttorney General's interpretation of Title II.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), our court addressed the question whether a plaintiff\n\nsuing under the ADA can recover for discrimination without showing that his disability was the sole\n\ncause for the adverse employment action taken against him. We answered the question in the\n\naffirmative. In discussing the issue, we noted that \"[t]he stated purpose of the ADA is \"to provide\n\na clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals\n\nwith disabilities.' \" 99 F.3d at 1073, quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). We acknowledged that Title\n\nI of the ADA applies to the private sector and provides for the elimination of disability-based\n\ndiscrimination.    We then stated that \"Title II of the ADA, which applies to public sector\n\nemployment, contains a parallel provision.\" Id. (emphasis added). Later, we again assumed that\n\nTitle II covered employment: \"Title II (the public sector title).\" Id. at 1074. Thus, without directly\n\fdiscussing the issue with which this court is presently faced, our court has assumed that Title II\n\ncovers public employment discrimination.\n\n       Additionally, in Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740413\"><a href=\"/opinion/740413/william-a-holbrook-v-city-of-alpharetta-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1997), we\n\naddressed the question whether claims brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA involving events that\n\noccurred prior to the effective date of Title I are actionable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act\n\nof 1973. In discussing this issue, we noted the language of Title II, the federal regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant to the ADA, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\")\n\nguide. 112 F.3d at 1528-29. The court then determined that \"Title II thus incorporates by reference\n\nthe substantive, detailed regulations prohibiting discrimination against disabled individuals\n\ncontained in Title I.\" Id. at 1529. We further noted:\n\n       The above regulations suggest that the provisions of Title II extending the protections\n       afforded to employees in the private sector under Title I to state and local government\n       workers became effective only when Title I went into effect. As explicitly described in the\n       EEOC manual, the Rehabilitation Act provided a remedy for discrimination in public\n       employment prior to the effective date of Title I. We conclude that Title II of the ADA did\n       not become effective until the date on which Title I became effective, July 26, 1992, and,\n       prior to that date, a plaintiff's remedy for discrimination under Title II of the ADA was the\n       Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nId. Thus, the court implicitly determined that Title II was the \"new replacement\" for the\n\nRehabilitation Act, which is what the legislative history indicates.\n\n       Although not decisions of our court, Lundstedt v. City of Miami, Cases 568 (S.D.Fla. Oct.11,\n\n1995), and Ethridge v. State of Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court in Ethridge found\n\nthat although a plain reading of Title II does not reveal whether it covers employment\n\ndiscrimination, the legislative history of and regulations promulgated under Title II make clear that\n\nthe section prohibits employment discrimination by public entities on the basis of disability. The\n\fcourt noted that the primary purpose of Title II was to extend the reach of Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act and that Section 504 \"clearly applies to employment discrimination.\" 847\n\nF.Supp. at 906, citing Consolidated Rail Corp. v.

The Ethridge court also discussed the House Report addressing Title II and\n\nthe regulations implementing Title II to find that Title II covers employment discrimination.\n\n        Additionally, the Ethridge court noted the difference in the application of the exhaustion\n\nrequirement which is mandatory in Title I but not in Title II of the ADA.7 The court found that\n\nalthough Title I requires exhaustion, Title II does not because it \"incorporates the enforcement\n\nprocedures of the Rehabilitation Act, ... which do not require exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nfor non-federal employees.\" 847 F.Supp. at 907. \"An analysis of Title II regulations further makes\n\nclear that, while resort to administrative remedies is optional, it is not required.\" Id. The court\n\nreferenced the regulations, which plainly state that exhaustion is not required. See 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.172, Appendix A. We agree with this analysis and note that it is generally presumed that\n\n\n   7\n    The district court in this case expressed great concern in the inconsistency in the exhaustion\nrequirement if the court found that Title II covered employment discrimination. \"Acceptance of\nthe \"no exhaustion rule,' when coupled with the slighting of Title II's plain meaning and the\nredundancy of Titles I and II, renders the entire statutory framework a monstrous distortion.\"\n942 F.Supp. at 1445. The court further stated that:\n\n               The statute the majority of the district courts (and the Justice Department) give us\n               is completely bewildering: Both Title I and Titles II apply to employment,\n               although Title II says nothing at all on the subject and Title I lays out a\n               comprehensive scheme to deal with employment issues; Title I says an employer\n               must hire 15 employees to be sued for employment discrimination, but you can\n               get around this under Title II if your employer is an arm of the State; Title I says\n               you must exhaust administrative remedies, but you can ignore this requirement\n               too if you are employed by the State. If this is really what Congress meant, then\n               the ADA surely must rank as one of the great drafting debacles of recent times.\n               Unwilling to impute such sheer ineptitude to Congress, the Court must part\n               company with the current consensus.\n\n       Id. at 1445-46.\n\fCongress acts intentionally and purposely where \" \"it includes particular language in one section of\n\na statute but omits it in another.' \" See Russello v.

Other courts' resolution of the issue\n\n       The only other circuit to consider this issue did not really discuss it. The court allowed a\n\nplaintiff to proceed against the employer/hospital under both the Rehabilitation Act and Title II. See\n\nDoe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692288\"><a href=\"/opinion/692288/john-doe-v-university-of-maryland-medical-system-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir.1995). The court found\n\nthat both Title II and the Rehabilitation Act \"prohibit discrimination against an otherwise qualified\n\nindividual with a disability.\" Id. at 1264. The court noted that the parties did not dispute that the\n\nMedical System was \"a \"public entity' subject to the provisions of Title II of the ADA.\" Id. n. 8.\n\nAccordingly, Doe does not provide much guidance on the issue before us for consideration.\n\n       In Wagner v. Texas A & M University, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1297</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.Tex.1996), the court\n\ndetermined that a tenured professor could bring a Title II claim against the University when he was\n\nnot rehired to his same position following a medical disability leave. In so finding, the court found\n\nthat Title II obtains its remedies from the Rehabilitation Act, which does not require exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies before filing suit. The court relied upon Ethridge in making its conclusion.\n\nIn its discussion, the court noted that Title II encompasses employment actions. 939 F.Supp. at\n\n1310. The court also discussed the policy anomaly created when Title II does not require exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies. The court stated that Title I and Title II create \"separate and distinct\n\nenforceable rights.\" Id. \"Title I addresses primarily the rights of disabled individuals in workplaces,\n\nwhile Title II addresses the rights of disabled citizens vis-a-vis the government.\" Id. The court stated\n\nthat this inconsistency \"is undesirable from a policy standpoint;\" however, given the DOJ's\n\fregulatory posture, the court would \"not fill the gaps in the ADA in an attempt to effectuate a\n\npurported Congressional intent that is not entirely evident.\" Id.

The plaintiffs filed suit under\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act and Titles I and II of the ADA. The court relied on the district court's decision\n\nin Petersen v.

However, in light of the foregoing discussion, these cases are not persuasive.\n\nEven the district judge in this case noted that he was \"swimming against the current,\" 942 F.Supp.\n\nat 1442, in deciding that Title II does not encompass employment discrimination claims.\n\n       In conclusion, we hold that Title II does state a cause of action for employment\n\ndiscrimination and reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n       REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f                         HILL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring specially:\n\n       I concur with reluctance.\n\n       In Part IIA, we conclude that the meaning and consequence of an unambiguous written\n\nrelease are subject to dispute, variance and avoidance because we, acting in loco parentis, find the\n\nadult parties to the contract in need of our patronage. Although troublesome, we apparently have\n\nsuch a role. See Puentes v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70950\"><a href=\"/opinion/70950/puentes-v-united-parcel-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1996).\n\n       In Part IIB, we find that Title II of the ADA (the Act) is carefully drafted to obfuscate.1\n\nCongress could have said \"discrimination in employment\" if it had wanted to do so. Here, however,\n\nit merely forbids the exclusion of qualified individuals \"from ... participat[ing] in or be[ing] denied\n\nthe benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity\" by reason of a disability.\n\n       The district judge concluded that the Act forbids discrimination vis-à-vis the \"output of these\n\npublic entities.\" See Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Soil and Water Conservation District, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(S.D.Fla.1996). If a constituent is angered by the district judge's interpretation or our holding today,\n\nhis or her Congressperson can say \"That's not what we passed. I would never have voted for that!\n\nThat's just the work of those activist judges.\"\n\n       So be it. The legislative power is vested in Congress. By concluding what Congress has\n\ndone, are we legislating? I hope not.\n\n       With a tip of the hat to the district judge, I reluctantly conclude that the flow of precedent\n\nis too strong for him or for us to swim upstream, and I\n\n       CONCUR.\n\n\n\n   1\n    The Act resembles the campaign address of a candidate appearing before an audience that\nwas split on a key issue.
