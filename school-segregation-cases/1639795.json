See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nIn the fall of 1996, a federal grand jury in the district of Maryland\nbegan investigating Anthony Jones and his associates for narcotics\nand murder offenses. In January 1997, after the grand jury returned\nthe first of four indictments against Jones charging him with both\nmurder and drug offenses, his foster brother John Jones testified\nbefore the grand jury about certain vehicles used by Anthony Jones\nin his drug business.\n\nWhen Anthony Jones learned that John Jones had testified against\nhim, he decided to have him killed. On February 24, 1997, during a\ntelephone call recorded by the correctional institution in which he was\nincarcerated, Anthony Jones directed his lieutenant to have John\nJones \"whacked.\" And, on the night of February 26-27, 1997, John\nJones was fatally shot four times in the specific manner ordered by\nAnthony Jones. Based on information provided by informants, law\nenforcement officers ultimately concluded that John Jones was killed\nby two juveniles, Hilton Thomas and appellant T.E.S.\n\nOn November 19, 1997, appellee, the United States, petitioned the\nCircuit Court of Baltimore City for release of court records concern-\ning T.E.S. and Thomas, averring that the juveniles were to be feder-\nally charged by information with certain offenses, including murder.\nThe United States' petition was granted on that day, and appellant's\nrecords were transferred to the Clerk of the United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland, where they remained under seal.\nOn January 8, 1998, a juvenile information was in fact filed charging\nT.E.S. with murder in aid of racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n1959; conspiracy to distribute narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n§ 846; and conspiracy to retaliate against witnesses, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. §§ 371 and 1513. Two weeks later, counsel was appointed to\nrepresent T.E.S. in federal court, and in early April 1998, the magis-\n\n                    2\n\ftrate held a hearing on the government's motion to transfer T.E.S. to\nthe district court's adult criminal jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 5032. The magistrate promptly issued a report and recommenda-\ntions, which included a recommendation of transfer. The district court\nthereafter adopted the magistrate's recommendations, and appellant\nsubsequently filed this expedited interlocutory appeal challenging\nboth the district court's transfer order and the constitutionality of the\nstate court's release of his juvenile record.\n\nI.\n\nAppellant first contends that his federal constitutional rights, spe-\ncifically his privacy rights, were violated when the Maryland state\ncourt delivered his juvenile court records under seal to the federal dis-\ntrict court, which court was considering, pursuant to a federal statute,\nwhether to try T.E.S. as an adult on charges including the murder of\na witness in a federal grand jury proceeding. We disagree with T.E.S.\nthat the state court's transfer of his records violated his constitutional\nrights.\n\nMaryland Annotated Code Section 3-828 provides, in relevant part,\nthat \"[a] court record pertaining to a child is confidential and its con-\ntents may not be divulged, by subpoena or otherwise, except by order\nof the court upon good cause shown.\" Md. Ann. Code, Cts. & Jud.\nProc. § 3-828. Appellant contends that this statute creates a confiden-\ntiality interest, protected by the federal Constitution, in the contents\nof his juvenile record. Even if appellant is correct that a state may\ncreate a constitutionally protected \"reasonable expectation of privacy\"\nin the nondisclosure of a juvenile's criminal record-- itself a doubt-\nful proposition, see Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693 (1976) (declining to\nfind a constitutional right to the nondisclosure of an individual's\narrest record); J.P. v. DeSanti, 653 F.2d 1080 (6th Cir. 1981) (dissem-\nination of juvenile social histories prepared by state probation officer\ndid not violate any federal constitutional privacy right of juveniles) --\nwe conclude that Maryland has not done so here. A state law provid-\ning for the release of juvenile records upon \"good cause shown\" sim-\nply cannot be said to create a reasonable expectation that the state\ncourt will withhold those records from a federal district court required\nby statute to obtain and review such records as a condition precedent\nto the decision whether to transfer a juvenile to adult criminal juris-\n\n                     3\n\fdiction. 18 U.S.C. § 5032. Particularly given that the state statute\nexplicitly contemplates release of the juvenile records in the context\nof further judicial proceedings, see § 3-828(b)(5), (d), (e), and (g), any\nexpectation appellant might have maintained that the material would\nnot be made available to a federal court considering his transfer to\nadult criminal jurisdiction for the alleged murder of a witness in a fed-\neral grand jury proceeding simply could not be characterized as \"rea-\nsonable.\" The two district court cases appellant advances in support\nof his novel claim are easily distinguished. See Sean R. v. Board of\nEduc., 794 F. Supp. 467 (D. Conn. 1992) (holding that a private right\nof action under § 1983 could lie for the unauthorized, public dissemi-\nnation of confidential information by a county school board about a\nstudent's learning disabilities); Soucie v. County of Monroe, 736 F.\nSupp. 33, 35-37 (W.D.N.Y. 1990) (dismissing a § 1983 claim but rec-\nognizing in dicta a constitutional right of privacy where an employee\nof the county probation department \"deceptively\" obtained and \"mali-\nciously\" disclosed the contents of a juvenile's pre-sentence report in\ndirect contravention of state law).\n\nDoubtless aware that neither caselaw nor the statute itself supports\nhis \"privacy\" claim, appellant argues alternatively that the state has\nalso created a \"liberty\" interest that cannot be abrogated without the\nfull panoply of procedural protections that the Due Process Clause\ndemands. In this regard, appellant relies upon a line of Supreme Court\ncases recognizing that a state statute or regulation may, under certain\ncircumstances, create a liberty interest protected by the Due Process\nClause. In the principal case upon which appellant relies, Hewitt v.\nHelm, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), the Supreme Court held that \"the\nrepeated use of explicitly mandatory language in connection with\nrequiring specific substantive predicates demands a conclusion that\nthe State has created a protected liberty interest.\" Id. at 472 (emphases\nadded). As a preliminary matter, appellant is apparently unaware that\nthe Supreme Court several years ago explicitly repudiated this very\napproach to the \"liberty interest\" analysis. See Sandin v. Conner, 515\nU.S. 472, 483-84 & n.5 (1995) (\"abandoning\" Hewitt's focus on the\n\"search for negative implication from mandatory language\" and\nreturning to earlier focus on the \"nature of the deprivation\"). In any\nevent, appellant's claim of a state-created protected liberty interest\ncannot satisfy even the more expansive, and now disavowed, standard\nhe advances. The Maryland statute in question lacks both the \"explicit\n\n                     4\n\fmandatory language\" and \"specific substantive predicates\" required\nby Hewitt. A requirement of a showing of\"good cause\" before a court\norder may issue cannot be read to \"explicitly\" require particular pro-\ncedural protections or provide any specific substantive predicates\nupon which a decision to release records must be based. Cf. Hewitt,\n459 U.S. at 472 (Court considered prison regulations governing the\nimposition of administrative segregation that included an explicit\nrequirement of notice, investigation, and a hearing, and established\nsubstantive predicates that segregation be based on\"the need for con-\ntrol\" or \"the threat of a serious disturbance\"); Olim v. Wakinekona,\n461 U.S. 238 (1983) (Court looked to see whether\"particularized\nstandards or criteria guide the State's decisionmakers\" before declin-\ning to find that Hawaii had created a protected liberty interest in a\nprisoner's right not to be transferred).\n\nFinally, even if appellant were able to establish the existence of\neither of his asserted constitutionally protected rights, it is undisputed\nthat he received notice, a hearing, and the able assistance of counsel\n-- all of the protections to which he now claims he was constitution-\nally entitled -- in federal court before his records were ever unsealed.\nWe decline to hold that appellant's federal constitutional rights have\nbeen violated by his receipt in federal rather than state court of\nexactly the process he claims he was due.\n\nAccordingly, because Maryland has created neither a\"reasonable\nexpectation of privacy\" nor a \"liberty\" interest that would implicate\nconstitutional due process protections and because, in any event,\nappellant received notice, hearing, and assistance of counsel in federal\ncourt, we affirm the district court's denial of appellant's motion to\nreturn his juvenile records to the state court.\n\nII.\n\nTurning now to appellant's second contention, that the District\nCourt lacked jurisdiction over his prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 5032\nand erred in transferring him to its adult criminal jurisdiction under\nthat section, we affirm the district court's transfer order.\n\nAs a threshold matter, we summarily dispose of appellant's claim\nthat the federal court lacked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 5032 to\n\n                     5\n\fproceed against him in federal court. Section 5032 provides for fed-\neral jurisdiction over a juvenile upon the Attorney General's certifica-\ntion that the \"offense charged is a crime of violence that is a felony\n. . ., and that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the\noffense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 5032. Appellant is accused of murder of a fed-\neral witness in aid of racketeering. It is difficult to imagine a case that\nimplicates a more substantial interest than the prevention of retalia-\ntion against and intimidation of federal witnesses. We will certainly\nrequire no more in affirming the district court's exercise of jurisdic-\ntion in this matter.\n\nThe remainder of appellant's § 5032 claims challenge the district\ncourt's finding that his transfer to adult criminal jurisdiction was \"in\nthe interest of justice.\" We review the district court's transfer decision\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Juvenile Male #1, 86 F.3d\n1314, 1324 (4th Cir. 1996). After reviewing the magistrate's careful\nfindings in light of our recent decision in Juvenile Male #1, we find\neach of appellant's claims to be without merit, and we affirm without\nhesitation the district court's transfer of appellant to the court's adult\ncriminal jurisdiction for trial. Because each of appellant's other spe-\ncific claims is squarely foreclosed by our decision in Juvenile Male\n#1, we address only one of appellant's particular assertions in any\ndetail.\n\nSection 5032 requires the court to consider and make findings as\nto six enumerated factors in determining whether transfer to adult\ncriminal jurisdiction is in the interests of justice.* Appellant contends\nthat in considering the second statutory factor, the\"nature of the\nalleged offense,\" the district court improperly considered evidence\n_________________________________________________________________\n*18 U.S.C. § 5032 provides, in relevant part:\n\n           Evidence of the following factors shall be considered, and\n          findings with regard to each factor shall be made in the record,\n          in assessing whether a transfer would be in the interest of justice:\n          the age and social background of the juvenile; the nature of the\n          alleged offense; the extent and nature of the juvenile's prior\n          delinquency record; the juvenile's present intellectual develop-\n          ment and psychological maturity; the nature of past treatment\n          efforts and the juvenile's response to such efforts; the availabil-\n          ity of programs designed to treat the juvenile's behavioral prob-\n          lems.\n\n                     6\n\f\"extrinsic\" to the charged offense and undertook an \"unwarranted\nexamination of the strength of the government's evidence.\" In addi-\ntion, appellant argues that the court placed \"undue\" emphasis on this\nsingle statutory factor. As to appellant's first objection, we find that\nthe magistrate properly refrained from weighing the merits of the gov-\nernment's case, and that the magistrate's deliberate consideration of\nthe particular circumstances of the offense charged is contemplated,\nif not required, by the statute. See In re Sealed Case (Juvenile\nTransfer), 893 F.2d 363, 370 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that \"nature\nof the alleged offense\" factor does not allow court to consider evi-\ndence of offenses distinct from the offense charged, but noting that\nit is proper for court to consider the specifics of the offense charged\nin order to evaluate offense's \"gravity\" and the juvenile's \"prospects\nfor . . . rehabilitation\"); United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d 1248, 1254\n(5th Cir. 1989) (permitting hearsay evidence about the \"nature\" of the\ncrime to be admitted in a transfer proceeding).\n\nWe further conclude that appellant's second objection to the dis-\ntrict court's consideration of the nature of the offense, that the court\nunduly emphasized this factor, is foreclosed by our holding in\nJuvenile Male #1. In that case, we stated that\"[i]n the weighing of\nthe various factors, the nature of the crime clearly predominates.\"\nJuvenile Male #1, 86 F.3d at 1323. Given the indisputable federal\ninterest in prosecuting the \"premeditated assassination of a witness in\na federal investigation,\" J.A. at 230, the magistrate was on firm\nground in concluding that this factor would warrant transfer to adult\nstatus \"even if all other factors were favorable to T.E.S.\" Id. Never-\ntheless, the magistrate proceeded, as the statute requires, to consider\neach factor in turn, and we find that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in concluding, after balancing all of the factors, that the\ntransfer of this \"juvenile,\" one month shy of his eighteenth birthday\nat the time of the alleged offenses, to the district court's adult criminal\njurisdiction was in the interests of justice.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is\naffirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                     7\n\f",

Wakinekona,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110921\"><a href=\"/opinion/110921/olim-v-wakinekona/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983) (Court looked to see whether\"particularized\nstandards or criteria guide the State's decisionmakers\" before declin-\ning to find that Hawaii had created a protected liberty interest in a\nprisoner's right not to be transferred).\n\nFinally, even if appellant were able to establish the existence of\neither of his asserted constitutionally protected rights, it is undisputed\nthat he received notice, a hearing, and the able assistance of counsel\n-- all of the protections to which he now claims he was constitution-\nally entitled -- in federal court before his records were ever unsealed.\nWe decline to hold that appellant's federal constitutional rights have\nbeen violated by his receipt in federal rather than state court of\nexactly the process he claims he was due.\n\nAccordingly, because Maryland has created neither a\"reasonable\nexpectation of privacy\" nor a \"liberty\" interest that would implicate\nconstitutional due process protections and because, in any event,\nappellant received notice, hearing, and assistance of counsel in federal\ncourt, we affirm the district court's denial of appellant's motion to\nreturn his juvenile records to the state court.\n\nII.\n\nTurning now to appellant's second contention, that the District\nCourt lacked jurisdiction over his prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 5032\nand erred in transferring him to its adult criminal jurisdiction under\nthat section, we affirm the district court's transfer order.\n\nAs a threshold matter, we summarily dispose of appellant's claim\nthat the federal court lacked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 5032 to\n\n                     5\n\fproceed against him in federal court. Section 5032 provides for fed-\neral jurisdiction over a juvenile upon the Attorney General's certifica-\ntion that the \"offense charged is a crime of violence that is a felony\n. . ., and that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the\noffense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 5032. Appellant is accused of murder of a fed-\neral witness in aid of racketeering. It is difficult to imagine a case that\nimplicates a more substantial interest than the prevention of retalia-\ntion against and intimidation of federal witnesses. We will certainly\nrequire no more in affirming the district court's exercise of jurisdic-\ntion in this matter.\n\nThe remainder of appellant's § 5032 claims challenge the district\ncourt's finding that his transfer to adult criminal jurisdiction was \"in\nthe interest of justice.\" We review the district court's transfer decision\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Juvenile Male #1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720531\"><a href=\"/opinion/720531/united-states-v-juvenile-male-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1324 (4th Cir. 1996). After reviewing the magistrate's careful\nfindings in light of our recent decision in Juvenile Male #1, we find\neach of appellant's claims to be without merit, and we affirm without\nhesitation the district court's transfer of appellant to the court's adult\ncriminal jurisdiction for trial. Because each of appellant's other spe-\ncific claims is squarely foreclosed by our decision in Juvenile Male\n#1, we address only one of appellant's particular assertions in any\ndetail.\n\nSection 5032 requires the court to consider and make findings as\nto six enumerated factors in determining whether transfer to adult\ncriminal jurisdiction is in the interests of justice.* Appellant contends\nthat in considering the second statutory factor, the\"nature of the\nalleged offense,\" the district court improperly considered evidence\n_________________________________________________________________\n*18 U.S.C. § 5032 provides, in relevant part:\n\n           Evidence of the following factors shall be considered, and\n          findings with regard to each factor shall be made in the record,\n          in assessing whether a transfer would be in the interest of justice:\n          the age and social background of the juvenile; the nature of the\n          alleged offense; the extent and nature of the juvenile's prior\n          delinquency record; the juvenile's present intellectual develop-\n          ment and psychological maturity; the nature of past treatment\n          efforts and the juvenile's response to such efforts; the availabil-\n          ity of programs designed to treat the juvenile's behavioral prob-\n          lems.\n\n                     6\n\f\"extrinsic\" to the charged offense and undertook an \"unwarranted\nexamination of the strength of the government's evidence.\" In addi-\ntion, appellant argues that the court placed \"undue\" emphasis on this\nsingle statutory factor. As to appellant's first objection, we find that\nthe magistrate properly refrained from weighing the merits of the gov-\nernment's case, and that the magistrate's deliberate consideration of\nthe particular circumstances of the offense charged is contemplated,\nif not required, by the statute. See In re Sealed Case (Juvenile\nTransfer), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534761\"><a href=\"/opinion/534761/in-re-sealed-case-juvenile-transfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that \"nature\nof the alleged offense\" factor does not allow court to consider evi-\ndence of offenses distinct from the offense charged, but noting that\nit is proper for court to consider the specifics of the offense charged\nin order to evaluate offense's \"gravity\" and the juvenile's \"prospects\nfor . . . rehabilitation\"); United States v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521002\"><a href=\"/opinion/521002/united-states-v-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1254\n(5th Cir. 1989) (permitting hearsay evidence about the \"nature\" of the\ncrime to be admitted in a transfer proceeding).\n\nWe further conclude that appellant's second objection to the dis-\ntrict court's consideration of the nature of the offense, that the court\nunduly emphasized this factor, is foreclosed by our holding in\nJuvenile Male #1. In that case, we stated that\"[i]n the weighing of\nthe various factors, the nature of the crime clearly predominates.\"\nJuvenile Male #1, 86 F.3d at 1323. Given the indisputable federal\ninterest in prosecuting the \"premeditated assassination of a witness in\na federal investigation,\" J.A. at 230, the magistrate was on firm\nground in concluding that this factor would warrant transfer to adult\nstatus \"even if all other factors were favorable to T.E.S.\" Id. Never-\ntheless, the magistrate proceeded, as the statute requires, to consider\neach factor in turn, and we find that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in concluding, after balancing all of the factors, that the\ntransfer of this \"juvenile,\" one month shy of his eighteenth birthday\nat the time of the alleged offenses, to the district court's adult criminal\njurisdiction was in the interests of justice.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is\naffirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                     7\n\f</pre>",
