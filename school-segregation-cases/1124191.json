Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit\nJudge DYK.\n\nSCHALL, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n      The United States appeals the November 16, 2007 amended final judgment of\n\nthe United States Court of Federal Claims, which granted Weeks Marine, Inc. (“Weeks”)\n\na permanent injunction after sustaining its pre-award protest. In sustaining Weeks’s\n\nprotest, the court determined that the Army Corps of Engineers’s (“Corps’s”) solicitation\n\nfor indefinite duration indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) multiple-award task order contracts\n\n(“MATOCs”) for dredging was contrary to 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a), and lacked a rational\n\fbasis. The court also determined that the solicitation was contrary to a requirement of\n\nthe Corps’s Engineering Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“EFARS”). Weeks\n\nMarine, Inc. v. United States, No. 07-700C (Fed. Cl. Nov. 16, 2007) (“Amended Final\n\nJudgment”). For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the solicitation does not\n\nviolate § 2304(a) and does not lack a rational basis. 1       We therefore reverse the\n\nAmended Final Judgment insofar as it enjoins the Corps from proceeding with the\n\nsolicitation. In all other respects the Amended Final Judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n                                            I.\n\n      Weeks lodged its protest in response to the Corps’s solicitation relating to\n\nmaintenance dredging and shore protection work in the Corps’s South Atlantic Division.\n\nThe South Atlantic Division encompasses all or part of six states: North Carolina, South\n\nCarolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. Currently, the Division has district\n\noffices in Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia;\n\nJacksonville, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama.\n\n      Maintenance dredging removes material (for example, silt and sand) from the\n\nbottom of a navigable waterway, in order to facilitate movement of commercial,\n\npleasure, and military vessels. Shore protection restores land along the shoreline that\n\nhas been damaged by erosion or weather events by redepositing material (for example,\n\nsand) along the water’s edge.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n              As explained below, we need not decide whether the solicitation is\ncontrary to EFARS.\n\n\n2008-5034                                   2\n\f       Up until now, the Corps has awarded dredging contracts in the South Atlantic\n\nDivision on a district basis through the use of competitive sealed bidding. 2 For each\n\nproject, the district in which the work is to take place prepares an invitation for bids\n\n(“IFB”) and receives bids from multiple dredging contractors. After bid opening, the\n\ncontract is awarded solely on the basis of price and price-related factors. Each district\n\noffice within the South Atlantic Division assesses its own dredging needs and issues its\n\nown IFBs; there is little coordination between the districts.\n\n       The MATOC solicitation represents a significant departure from current Corps\n\npractice. First, the solicitation employs a negotiated, rather than sealed bidding, format.\n\nSecond, pursuant to the solicitation, multiple contractors will be awarded indefinite\n\nduration indefinite quantity multiple-award task order contracts (IDIQ MATOCs). It is\n\nenvisioned that, thereafter, an unknown number (“indefinite quantity”) of task orders will\n\nbe issued under each of the contracts. MATOC contractors will submit bids and will\n\ncompete with each other for task orders as they arise. Through the solicitation, the\n\nCorps is seeking to cover all dredging projects within the South Atlantic Division over\n\nthe next five years. 3\n\n       The Corps created an Acquisition Plan to explain its decision to switch\n\nprocurement methods, and to provide details about the procurement plan.               The\n\nAcquisition Plan lists 108 potential projects divided into four MATOC groups: Group I,\n\n\n       2\n              Currently, dredging contracts are awarded through the Savannah District\n(serving parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia), the Jacksonville District\n(serving parts of Georgia and Florida), and the Mobile District (serving parts of Georgia,\nFlorida, Alabama, and Mississippi). See U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers, South Atlantic\nDivision, available at http://www.sad.usace.army.mil/contracting.htm.\n       3\n             Upon award, each MATOC contract will have a mandatory one-year base\nterm and four one-year options. Hence, the “indefinite duration” label.\n\n\n2008-5034                                     3\n\fcertified hopper dredging projects (2–5 total MATOC contracts); 4 Group II, small\n\nbusiness set-aside projects (2–7 total MATOC contracts); Group III, shore-protection\n\nprojects (2–7 total MATOC contracts); and Group IV, other projects not listed in any of\n\nthe other three categories (2–7 total MATOC contracts). Each group has an estimated\n\ncost of between $440 million and $500 million for the full five-year period. That means\n\nthat, assuming all four option years are exercised, the total cost of the procurement will\n\nbe approximately $2 billion. The minimum task order amount is $100,000, while the\n\nmaximum is $500 million.       Although each MATOC awardee will be guaranteed a\n\ncontractual minimum of $2500, there is no guarantee that any awardee will receive\n\nmore than that amount.\n\n       The Corps will evaluate proposals it receives in response to the solicitation on a\n\n“best value” basis. The evaluation will take into account four factors: (1) technical merit,\n\n(2) past performance, (3) price, and (4) utilization of small businesses. The technical\n\nmerit factor will assess whether a party submitting a proposal possesses dredging\n\nequipment. A party’s past performance rating may vary from “very low risk,” to “very\n\nhigh risk,” with four intermediate levels.    The risk factor will assess a prospective\n\ncontractor’s competency in performing prior work (rated on a six-level scale), and the\n\nrelevancy of that work (rated on a three-level scale). As far as price is concerned, the\n\nsolicitation includes four representative tasks.    Each party submitting a proposal in\n\nresponse to the solicitation will submit a bid on one of the tasks, thereby allowing the\n\nCorps to evaluate the price factor for that party. Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States,\n\n79 Fed. Cl. 22, 27 (2007) (“Initial Opinion”). The Corps will pick several contractors for\n\n       4\n              Hopper dredging involves the use of specialized equipment. The Corps\nasserts only a small number of dredgers have this equipment.\n\n\n2008-5034                                    4\n\feach MATOC based on the four listed factors.           Individual task orders under the\n\nMATOCs will be awarded primarily using Low Price Technical Acceptable procedures,\n\nalthough the Corps states in the Acquisition Plan that it will use Best Value Trade Off\n\nprocedures for some tasks.\n\n       Before issuing the solicitation, the Corps “conducted market research,” in order to\n\nevaluate potential interest in the solicitation and the availability of contractors for the\n\ntask order work. Ten contractors, including Weeks, indicated interest in the solicitation.\n\nWeeks is a large marine construction and dredging company. It performed eighteen\n\ndredging contracts for the South Atlantic Division in the five years prior to the\n\nsolicitation. Weeks was one of only three contractors that expressed interest in the\n\nsolicitation that had (1) unlimited bonding capability, (2) hopper dredging equipment,\n\nand (3) significant dredging experience.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The MATOC solicitation issued on June 4, 2007.          On September 28, 2007,\n\nWeeks filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nto prevent the South Atlantic Division from moving forward with the procurement. After\n\nthe Corps filed a 2000 page administrative record, the parties filed cross motions for\n\njudgment on the administrative record. After hearing oral argument, the court issued a\n\nsealed version of its opinion on November 1, 2007. The opinion was made public on\n\nNovember 6, 2007, after the parties had a chance to review the sealed version and\n\nsubmit proposed redactions of confidential information. Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at\n\n22.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   5\n\f       In the Initial Opinion, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that the MATOC\n\nsolicitation violated 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(2), which provides that sealed bidding must be\n\nused when an agency plans to award a contract based solely on price and price-related\n\nfactors. Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 29–30. Although the Corps indicated it would be\n\nevaluating non-price-related factors, the court found that the “evaluation factors will not\n\npermit the determination of any meaningful distinctions among the offerors, nor will they\n\nallow for any different ways to make task orders awards.” Id. at 30. Thus, the court\n\nreasoned the Corps would actually be making its determination based on price. Id.\n\n       The Court of Federal Claims also ruled that the MATOC solicitation had no\n\nrational basis. Having ruled in its disposition of the § 2304(a) issue that the Corps\n\nwould not be considering non-price related factors, such as contractor qualifications, the\n\ncourt rejected the additional justifications proffered for the Corps’s procurement action.\n\nInitial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 31–34.     The government asserted the use of IDIQ\n\nMATOCs would reduce the procurement cycle, but the court found “the record\n\ncontain[ed] no evidence showing that a shortened procurement cycle would enhance\n\n[the] ability to complete projects in a timely manner.”        Id. at 32.    Although the\n\ngovernment asserted that the new procurement scheme would reduce administrative\n\ncosts by $1.5 million over two years, the court found “no evidence of how this savings is\n\ncalculated, or how it will occur.” Id. at 33. Further, the court found that the hours\n\nestimated for evaluating the proposals received in response to the solicitation were too\n\nlow for a negotiated procurement, and that administrative costs thus would likely be\n\nmuch higher than estimated. Id. The government also argued that IDIQ MATOCs\n\nwould reduce the need for emergency procurements. However, the court rejected this\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   6\n\fcontention as well, indicating that emergency procurements had constituted only 2.4\n\npercent of South Atlantic Division expenditures in the prior two years, and did not justify\n\na “procurement overhaul.” Id. Additionally, the government asserted that the IDIQ\n\nMATOCs would increase coordination between the districts in the Corps’s South\n\nAtlantic Division.   The Court of Federal Claims found, though, that the need for\n\nincreased coordination did not warrant a change from sealed bidding, but rather\n\nnecessitated the vesting of oversight in one office.      Id. at 33–34.     The court then\n\ndismissed in summary fashion all other arguments proffered by the government, stating\n\nthat the record was “devoid of credible evidence” that competition would increase, that\n\nsmall businesses would benefit, or that national security would be improved through the\n\nuse of IDIQ MATOCs. Id. The court thus concluded that the proposed solicitation\n\nlacked a rational basis. Addressing the regulatory framework, the court concluded that\n\nthe solicitation did not comply with the EFARS requirement that indefinite delivery\n\ncontracts could only be used in certain limited circumstances. Id. at 31.\n\n       Having determined that the solicitation did not comply with § 2304(a) and the\n\nEFARS, and lacked a rational basis, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that Weeks had\n\nsucceeded on the merits of its protest. The court then turned to the remaining three\n\nfactors to be considered in determining whether an injunction should issue: irreparable\n\nharm, the balance of hardships, and the public interest. See, e.g., Centech Group, Inc.\n\nv. United States, 554 F.3d 1029, 1036–37 (Fed. Cir. 2009); PGBA, LLC v. United\n\nStates, 389 F.3d 1219, 1228–29 (Fed. Cir. 2004).         Doing so, the court concluded\n\ninjunctive relief was appropriate. Initial Decision, 79 Fed. Cl. at 34–37. The court\n\ntherefore granted Weeks’s motion for judgment on the administrative record, and denied\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   7\n\fthe government’s motion. As a result, the court entered an order enjoining the Corps\n\n“from using Solicitation No. W 912EP-07-R-0007 to receive proposals or to award\n\nnegotiated IDIQ contracts or task orders for maintenance dredging or shore protection\n\nservices.” Id. at 37.\n\n       On November 7 and 8, 2007, the Corps issued presolicitation notices announcing\n\nindividual negotiated procurements for the same four task orders that were to be used\n\nas the basis for proposal evaluation under the enjoined solicitation.       The proposed\n\ncontracts were styled as separate negotiated procurements (as opposed to IDIQs), and\n\nthus were viewed by the Corps as eliminating the ability to issue any “follow-on task\n\norders.” Asserting that these notices violated the injunction, Weeks filed a motion to\n\nenforce or amend the November 1, 2007 judgment. It also requested an order to show\n\ncause as to why the Corps should not be found in contempt of court. The Court of\n\nFederal Claims conducted a hearing on these issues on November 15, 2007.                On\n\nNovember 16, 2007, the court vacated the November 1 injunction, and issued a new\n\norder to amend and enforce judgment. Amended Final Judgment, slip op. at 4. The\n\nnew order enjoined the Corps with respect to three of the solicitations. Id. at 3. The\n\ncourt allowed the fourth solicitation, relating to a dredging project for Kings Bay, Georgia\n\nand Fernandina Harbor, Florida, to proceed because of unique obstacles to sealed\n\nbidding at those sites. Specifically, the court noted particular “urgency surrounding this\n\nproject,” and heightened military and national security needs. Id. at 3. The government\n\nhas timely appealed the Amended Final Judgment. 5\n\n\n\n       5\n          The parties have advised us that the Corps has suspended action on the\nMATOC procurement pending this appeal.\n\n\n2008-5034                                    8\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n                                             I.\n\n       Under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1), the Court of Federal Claims is authorized “to\n\nrender judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a\n\nFederal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract . . . or [to] any alleged\n\nviolation of statute or regulation in connection with a Federal procurement or proposed\n\nprocurement.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1). We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) and (c)(1).\n\n       We review the Court of Federal Claims’s “determination on the legal issue of the\n\ngovernment’s conduct, in a grant of judgment upon the administrative record, without\n\ndeference.” Bannum v. United States, 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2005). We thus\n\napply the “arbitrary and capricious” standard of the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), conducting the same analysis as the Court of Federal\n\nClaims. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4); Bannum, 404 F.3d at 1351. In applying the APA to\n\nprotests such as the one before us, we determine whether “(1) the procurement official’s\n\ndecision lacked a rational basis; or (2) the procurement procedure involved a violation of\n\nregulation or procedure.” PGBA, LLC, 389 F.3d at 1225. On appeal, the government\n\nargues that Weeks has not alleged competitive injury, and therefore does not have\n\nstanding to challenge the MATOC solicitation. On the merits, the government contends\n\nthat the solicitation facially considers factors other than price, and thus does not violate\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2304(a). It also argues that the decision of the Corps to switch from sealed\n\nbidding to negotiated procurement IDIQ MATOCs has a rational basis and does not\n\nviolate the EFARS. We first address the issue of standing.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    9\n\f                                               II.\n\n        “Federal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction; they have only the power\n\nthat is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress\n\npursuant thereto. For that reason, every federal appellate court has a special obligation\n\nto ‘satisfy itself . . . of its own jurisdiction . . . .’” Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist.,\n\n475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986). “The Court of Federal Claims, though an Article I court, . . .\n\napplies the same standing requirements enforced by other federal courts created under\n\nArticle III.” Anderson v. United States, 344 F.3d 1343, 1350 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\n“Whether a party has standing to sue is a question that this court reviews de novo,\n\nalthough we disturb [the Court of Federal Claims’s] factual findings only if they are\n\nclearly erroneous.” Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States, 275 F.3d\n\n1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in\n\noriginal).\n\n       The standing issue in this case is framed by 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1), which we\n\nhave found imposes more stringent standing requirements than Article III.                Cf. Am.\n\nFed’n of Gov. Employees v. United States, 258 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2001)\n\n(“We . . . are not convinced that Congress, when using the term ‘interested party’ to\n\ndefine those who can bring suit under § 1491(b)(1), intended to confer standing on\n\nanyone who might have standing under the [Administrative Procedure Act].”). Section\n\n1491(b)(1) provides that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction\n\n               to render judgment on an action by an interested party\n               objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or\n               proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or\n               the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or\n               regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed\n               procurement. Both the United States Court of Federal\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                      10\n\f              Claims and the district courts of the United States shall have\n              jurisdiction to entertain such an action without regard to\n              whether suit is instituted before or after the contract is\n              awarded.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1). For purposes of this case, the pertinent part of § 1491(b)(1) is\n\nthat which states that an “interested party” may object “to a solicitation . . . for bids or\n\nproposals for a proposed contract” or to “any alleged violation of statute or regulation in\n\nconnection with a procurement or proposed procurement.” We have held that standing\n\nunder § 1491(b)(1) “is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct\n\neconomic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by the failure to\n\naward the contract.” Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Employees, 258 F.3d at 1302. Thus, to come\n\nwithin the Court of Federal Claims’s § 1491(b)(1) bid protest jurisdiction, Weeks is\n\nrequired to establish that it “(1) is an actual or prospective bidder and (2) possess[es]\n\nthe requisite direct economic interest.” Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States, 448 F.3d\n\n1305, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2006). We have stated that “[t]o prove a direct economic interest\n\nas a putative prospective bidder, [the bidder] is required to establish that it had a\n\n‘substantial chance’ of receiving the contract.” Id.; see also Info. Tech. & Applications v.\n\nUnited States, 316 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“To establish prejudice, [the\n\nprotestor] must show that there was a ‘substantial chance’ it would have received the\n\ncontract award but for the alleged error in the procurement process.”); Statistica, Inc. v.\n\nChristopher, 102 F.3d 1577, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (same).\n\n       The government concedes that the “prospective bidder” prong of the interested\n\nparty test is met in this case. It acknowledges that Weeks intends to bid on the MATOC\n\ncontracts, is able to do so, and is capable of doing the dredging work contemplated by\n\nthe contracts. At oral argument, government counsel stated, “[P]art of the standard\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   11\n\frequires that you actually be a contractor, that you have the financial wherewithal to\n\nactually bid on these projects, [and] the technical capability as well.” Oral arg. 8:20–\n\n8:40 (Jan. 7, 2009), available at http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-\n\n5034.mp3. Continuing, counsel stated that this aspect of the interested party test was\n\nnot disputed. Id. at 8:45-47. As noted, Weeks performed eighteen dredging contracts\n\nfor the South Atlantic Division in the five years prior to the solicitation. And, as also\n\nnoted, Weeks was one of only three contractors that expressed interest in the\n\nsolicitation that had (1) unlimited bonding capability, (2) hopper dredging equipment,\n\nand (3) significant dredging experience. Indeed, the government has conceded that\n\nWeeks will almost certainly be in the MATOC pool. See Appellant’s Br. 48 (“[E]ven the\n\ntrial court recognized that Weeks would likely have received one of the awards under\n\nthe MATOC.”).\n\n      Turning to the “direct economic interest” prong of the interested party test,\n\nhowever, the government argues that Weeks has failed to demonstrate prejudice or\n\nharm arising from the MATOC solicitation. According to the government, any potential\n\ninjury to Weeks is speculative, and is not the competitive injury required for standing\n\nbecause it is borne equally by all bidders. The government contends that Weeks’s\n\nallegations simply amount to a critique of IDIQ contracts in general rather than a\n\nparticularized injury due to the use of such contracts.       Appellant’s Br. 46.     The\n\ngovernment argues that Weeks has not established a “harm that ties the company’s\n\nbusiness situation to the solicitation at issue.” Oral arg. 8:20–8:25. In other words, the\n\ngovernment argues that Weeks cannot establish that there was “not only some\n\nsignificant error in the procurement process, but also that there was a substantial\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  12\n\fchance it would have received the contract but for that error.” Statistica, 102 F.3d at\n\n1582. The government urges that the “substantial chance” test is the test for proving\n\neconomic interest and prejudice, even in the pre-award context.              In making this\n\nargument, the government draws upon our standing discussions in post-award bid\n\nprotests. See, e.g., Info. Tech., 316 F.3d at 1319 (“[B]ecause the question of prejudice\n\ngoes directly to the question of standing, the prejudice issue must be reached before\n\naddressing the merits. . . . To establish prejudice, [the protestor] must show that there\n\nwas a ‘substantial chance’ it would have received the contract award but for the alleged\n\nerror in the procurement process.”); Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., 275 F.3d at\n\n1370 (“[P]rejudice (or injury) is a necessary element of standing. . . . [T]he substantial\n\nchance rule continues to apply.”).\n\n       Weeks responds that it will suffer prejudice from having to compete in a\n\n“discretionary, subjective, and essentially unreviewable process,” which, it contends,\n\nviolates applicable laws and regulations. Appellee’s Br. 41. Weeks also argues that “an\n\nunauthorized or irrational form of solicitation” will impact its ability to compete and thrive\n\nbecause it has “built [its] compan[y] and marketing plan” around the long-used system\n\nof sealed bidding. Oral arg. at 18:25–18:30. Weeks maintains further that its injury is\n\nnot merely a critique of the IDIQ procurement method, but rather stems from the\n\n“agency’s choice to use an unauthorized contract vehicle that violated procurement\n\nstatutes and regulations and lacked a rational basis.” Appellee’s Br. 50. Finally, Weeks\n\ncounters that the “substantial chance” test is inappropriate in the pre-award context\n\nbecause “[a]t the pre-award juncture, a plaintiff usually will not know who the other\n\nofferors are and may not know [its] bona fides.” Red River Serv. Corp. v. United States,\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    13\n\f60 Fed. Cl. 532, 539 (2004). Thus, Weeks advocates for the pre-award test articulated\n\nby the Court of Federal Claims in WinStar Communications, Inc. v. United States, 41\n\nFed. Cl. 748 (1998), and adopted by the Court of Federal Claims in this case. In\n\nWinStar, the Court of Federal Claims stated that a prospective offeror could establish\n\nthe prejudice necessary for standing by showing “a non-trivial competitive injury which\n\ncan be redressed by judicial relief.” Id. at 763.\n\n       Section 1491(b)(1) provides in pertinent part that an “interested party” may object\n\nto a solicitation . . . for bids or proposals for a proposed contract” or to “any alleged\n\nviolation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or proposed\n\nprocurement.” As just discussed, the government does not dispute that Weeks meets\n\nthe “prospective bidder” prong of the interested party test.\n\n       We have not had occasion to discuss what is required to prove an economic\n\ninterest, and thus prejudice, in a case such as this, where a prospective bidder/offeror is\n\nchallenging a solicitation in the pre-award context. In such a case, it is difficult for a\n\nprospective bidder/offeror to make the showing of prejudice that we have required in\n\npost-award bid protest cases. See, e.g., Statistica, 102 F.3d at 1582 (holding that a\n\ncontractor lacked standing because it failed to show a “substantial chance it would have\n\nreceived the contract award but for” agency error). The reason of course is that, in a\n\ncase such as this, there have been neither bids/offers, nor a contract award. Hence,\n\nthere is no factual foundation for a “but for” prejudice analysis. However, Article III\n\nconsiderations require a party such as Weeks to make a showing of some prejudice.\n\nSee, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 553, 560 (1992) (“First, the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    14\n\fmust have suffered an ‘injury in fact’ . . . .”); Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., 275 F.3d\n\nat 1370 (“[P]rejudice (or injury) is a necessary element of standing.”).\n\n       The Court of Federal Claims has advocated several different standards for\n\nevaluating standing in pre-award bid protests. In Red River Service Corp., the court\n\nindicated it would follow the plain statutory language and our holding in American\n\nFederation that § 1491(b)(1) “is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors\n\nwhose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by the\n\nfailure to award the contract.” 60 Fed. Cl. at 539. The court declined to add any\n\nadditional judicial gloss “until the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n\ndirects otherwise.”   Id.   At the same time, in some pre-award cases, the Court of\n\nFederal Claims has continued to recite the substantial chance test.           See, e.g., L-3\n\nCommc’ns EOTech, Inc. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 643, 651 (2008); CNA Corp. v.\n\nUnited States, 81 Fed. Cl. 722, 725–26 (2008). In this case, the court chose to use the\n\nWinStar standard, where standing is established by alleging “a non-trivial competitive\n\ninjury which can be redressed by judicial relief.” See also Allied Materials & Equip. Co.\n\nv. United States, 81 Fed. Cl. 448, 456 (2008) (advocating the WinStar standard).\n\n       Upon consideration of the matter, we conclude that the standard applied by the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims in this case strikes the appropriate balance between the\n\nlanguage of § 1491(b)(1), which contemplates an “an action by an interested party\n\nobjecting to a solicitation for bids or proposals . . . or any alleged violation of statute or\n\nregulation in connection with . . . a proposed procurement,” and Article III standing\n\nrequirements. We therefore consider whether Weeks has demonstrated a “non-trivial\n\ncompetitive injury which can be addressed by judicial relief.” We conclude that it has.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    15\n\f       We agree with the Court of Federal Claims’s assessment of the “non-trivial\n\ncompetitive” injury faced by Weeks based upon its contention as to the illegality of the\n\nMATOC solicitation. The court stated\n\n       Weeks was one of only three contractors that had “unlimited”\n       bonding capability, “significant” dredging experience, and\n       possessed Coast Guard certified equipment for Group One\n       projects. AR 21. Under sealed bidding procedures, there is a\n       substantial chance that Weeks would be the lowest responsive and\n       responsible bidder on a significant portion of the $1,392,000,000 in\n       projects in Groups I, III, and IV. Under the IDIQ task order\n       solicitation, however, Weeks would only be guaranteed a minimum\n       of $2,500 and [the South Atlantic Division] could deny Weeks all\n       task orders for the next five years without any explanation or\n       discussions, or any ability for Weeks to seek bid protest review.\n       This non-trivial competitive injury is capable of being redressed by\n       this Court.\n\n       ....\n\n       In this case, the solicitation prevents Weeks from competing for\n       $1,392,000,000 in task order awards over the next five years\n       through sealed bidding.\n\nInitial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 35.\n\n       Weeks established an interest in bidding, sent in complaints and concerns, noted\n\nits contracting ability, and suggested it would likely receive a substantial percentage of\n\nthe contracts in sealed bidding.      Whether Weeks is the winning or losing bidder,\n\naccording to Weeks’s theory of the case the solicitation may eventually be overturned\n\ndue to illegality. This is not a pre-award case where the alleged violation is “immaterial”\n\nand will not have an impact on Weeks’s economic situation. See CACI Field Servs.,\n\nInc. v. United States, 854 F.2d 464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (discussing prejudice in the\n\npre-award context). Rather, Weeks has a definite economic stake in the solicitation\n\nbeing carried out in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If the MATOC\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   16\n\fsolicitation is allowed to go forward, it will dictate Weeks’s bidding and government work\n\nin the South Atlantic Division for the next five years. In sum, Weeks is an interested\n\nparty who has demonstrated the requisite degree of prejudice for standing.             We\n\ntherefore hold that it has established standing.\n\n       Our conclusion that Weeks has standing to challenge the MATOC solicitation is\n\nconsistent, we think, with our decision in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, 492\n\nF.3d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2007).     We believe that Blue & Gold Fleet helps compel our\n\nconclusion that Weeks has statutory standing. Section 1491(b)(1) specifically confers\n\njurisdiction on the Court of Federal Claims to hear pre-award bid protests, stating an\n\n“interested party” may object to “any alleged violation of statute or regulation in\n\nconnection with a procurement or proposed procurement.” In Blue & Gold Fleet we held\n\n“that a party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation\n\ncontaining a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process\n\nwaives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims.” 492 F.3d at 1313. In Blue & Gold Fleet, the government\n\nissued a solicitation for, inter alia, “ferry transportation” and “concessions” services at\n\nAlcatraz Island. Id. at 1311. After Blue & Gold lost the contract, it filed a protest\n\nindicating that the awardee had not properly included in its bid “the wages and benefits\n\nfor its employees required by the Services Contract Act.” Id. at 1312. The Court of\n\nFederal Claims concluded that Blue & Gold was actually challenging the terms of the\n\nsolicitation, and thus had waived its opportunity to protest. We agreed, noting that the\n\nsolicitation itself “did not include any requirement that the bidders consider the Service\n\nContract Act.” Id. at 1313. Thus, Blue & Gold was actually challenging the terms and\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   17\n\frequirements of the solicitation. In holding that Blue & Gold had waived its opportunity\n\nto protest, we noted the GAO regulation, 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1), indicating that GAO\n\nprotests “based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to\n\n. . . the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to . . . the time set for\n\nreceipt of initial proposals.” Blue & Gold Fleet, 492 F.3d at 1314. We stated that\n\n“‘[v]endors cannot sit on their rights to challenge what they believe is an unfair\n\nsolicitation, roll the dice and see if they receive the award . . . .’” Id. (quoting Argencord\n\nMach. & Equip. v. United States, 68 Fed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005)).\n\n       In light of Blue & Gold Fleet, were we to hold that Weeks cannot now challenge\n\nthe MATOC solicitation in the Court of Federal Claims, we effectively would be saying\n\nthat this court has set up a judicial scheme whereby a party runs afoul of the waiver rule\n\nif it waits to challenge a solicitation (as Blue & Gold did), but is properly dismissed on\n\nstanding grounds if it raises the challenge pre-award (as Weeks has done). Such a\n\nresult would be anomalous.\n\n       Finally, by its terms, § 1491(b)(1) indicates that interested parties are able to\n\nchallenge facial defects in solicitations. Cf. Ramcor Servs. Group, Inc. v. United States,\n\n185 F.3d 1286, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (“If § 1491(b) required a challenge to the merits of\n\nthe contract award, the contractor would never need to use the ‘violation’ prong but\n\ncould always rely on other jurisdictional grants in § 1491(b)(1).”). Thus, in some cases\n\nthe injury stemming from a facially illegal solicitation may in and of itself be enough to\n\nestablish standing; in such a case a bidder should not have to wait until the solicitation\n\nis applied unfavorably to establish injury.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                      18\n\f        For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that in a pre-award protest such as the\n\none before us, prospective bidder or offeror must establish “a non-trivial competitive\n\ninjury which can be redressed by judicial relief” to meet the standing requirement of\n\n§ 1491(b)(1). Under that standard, we hold that Weeks has standing to challenge the\n\nMATOC solicitation in the Court of Federal Claims. We turn now to the merits.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        We first address Weeks’s contention that the MATOC solicitation violates\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2304(a). Section 2304(a) provides that, in conducting a procurement for\n\nproperty or services, an agency “shall obtain full and open competition through the use\n\nof competitive procedures.” 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(1)(A). The statute directs agencies to\n\n“use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best\n\nsuited under the circumstances of the procurement.” Id. § 2304(a)(1)(B). In that regard,\n\nit states:\n\n              (2) In determining the competitive procedure appropriate\n              under the circumstances, the head of an agency—\n                     (A) shall solicit sealed bids if—\n                            (i) time permits the solicitation, submission,\n                            and evaluation of sealed bids;\n                            (ii) the award will be made on the basis of price\n                            and other price-related factors;\n                            (iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions\n                            with the responding sources about their bids;\n                            and\n                            (iv) there is a reasonable expectation of\n                            receiving more than one sealed bid; and\n                     (B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids\n                     are not appropriate under clause (A).\n\nId. § 2304(a)(2).\n\n        On appeal, the government argues that, on its face, the MATOC solicitation\n\nconsiders non-price-related factors, and that therefore the Corps is using a negotiated\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   19\n\fprocurement under § 2304(a)(2)(B). Specifically, the government contends the Corps is\n\naddressing (1) technical merit, (2) past performance, and (3) small business concerns.\n\nThe solicitation, the government notes, states that “past performance is considered\n\nsignificantly more important than price” and that “all evaluation factors, when combined,\n\nare significantly more important than price.”      Weeks responds that while the Corps\n\nstates that it will be evaluating non-price factors, and that the solicitation thus falls under\n\n§ 2304(a)(2)(B), a closer look at the solicitation and the dredging industry reveals that\n\nthe Corps will continue to limit its inquiry to price and price-related factors only. Thus,\n\nWeeks contends the solicitation is covered by § 2304(a)(2)(A) and that sealed bidding is\n\nrequired.\n\n       We conclude that Weeks has not established a violation of § 2304(a).               The\n\nsolicitation expressly states that the Corps will consider non-price factors, and that past\n\nperformance is “significantly more important than price.” In addition, in the solicitation\n\nthe Corps explained how it will evaluate technical merit, past performance, and small\n\nbusiness factors. Moreover, Weeks acknowledged at oral argument that, its arguments\n\nrelating to the Corps’s intentions notwithstanding, the Corps has complied with the\n\nrequirements of § 2304(a):\n\n              The Court: “It does on its face say ‘we’re going to consider\n              non-price-related factors’—isn’t that the end of it?”\n              Weeks: “Facially yes . . . they have satisfied what the statute\n              requires . . . .”\n              The Court: “Doesn’t the case then come down to whether\n              the government established a rational basis for the\n              structuring of the procurement?\n              Weeks: “Yes, I believe it does . . . I think that is more what\n              the case is about.”\n\nOral arg. at 30:51-31:21. It is to the issue of rational basis that we now turn.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     20\n\f                                             IV.\n\n       The government argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred in ruling the\n\nCorps’s procurement action lacked a rational basis.          In making this argument, it\n\ncontends that the court should not have dismissed the Corps’s reasons for switching to\n\na negotiated procurement scheme. The government argues, as it did in the Court of\n\nFederal Claims, that the IDIQ MATOCs will allow the Corps to (1) pick more qualified\n\ncontractors because it will be able to rely on factors other than price; (2) reduce\n\nprocurement time; (3) lower administrative costs by an estimated $1.45 million in the\n\nnext two years; (4) reduce or eliminate the need for emergency procurements; (5) have\n\ngreater coordination between individual districts of the South Atlantic Division;\n\n(6) facilitate the use of small businesses; and (7) promote national security through\n\nmore timely execution of dredging near military bases.\n\n       Addressing its first rationale, the government argues that the responsibility\n\ndeterminations the Corps currently is required to make pursuant to Federal Acquisition\n\nRegulation (“FAR”) § 9.401-1, 48 C.F.R. § 9.104-1, when there is sealed bidding, are\n\nnot adequate surrogates for the evaluations of past performance it requires. 6 According\n\nto the government, a FAR responsibility determination only addresses whether a\n\ncontractor has a “satisfactory performance record.” By contrast, the MATOC negotiated\n\nprocurement scheme, it is urged, will allow for more nuanced evaluations.                  A\n\nprospective contractor may receive different ratings for various criteria, and the Corps\n\nwill have the flexibility to weigh different factors as it sees fit. The government indicates\n\nthat the more detailed rating system for competency and relevancy in the MATOC\n\n       6\n              FAR § 9.104-1 provides that a contractor must satisfy seven criteria in\norder to be deemed “responsible.”\n\n\n2008-5034                                    21\n\fsolicitation will allow the Corps to avoid hiring contractors who may do “satisfactory”\n\nwork, but may not have the particular expertise needed to perform certain dredging\n\njobs. Through the consideration of past performance, the government contends the\n\nCorps will be able to have dredging work done by contractors with the highest skills and\n\nwho offer the best value. See Acquisition Plan at 2 (“It has become increasingly difficult\n\nin today’s operating environment to obtain bids from responsible contractors capable of\n\nmeeting performance requirements and time constraints.”).\n\n       As to reduction in procurement time, the government states that “time is of the\n\nessence” because (1) “environmental windows compress the schedule for dredging in\n\nmuch of the South Atlantic region,” and (2) unplanned events often arise that call for\n\nincreased flexibility. The Corps estimates the IDIQ solicitation method could save as\n\nmuch as forty-five days per project in terms of the bidding period alone. 7             See\n\nAcquisition Plan (“It is estimated that this contracting mechanism will save as much as\n\n45 days in the procurement cycle of each project.”). Further, the government argues\n\nthat the new procurement scheme will “spare [the South Atlantic Division] from the need\n\nto construct time-intensive Invitation[s] for Bids, since a task order can be created more\n\nquickly,” thus saving additional time and resources. Appellant’s Br. 30; see Acquisition\n\nPlan (“[T]here is limited time to prepare the invitation for bid . . . or the request for\n\nproposal . . . . This will be mitigated by the development of IDIQs which allow for a\n\nsignificant reduction in acquisition time. In addition, issuance of task orders is a faster\n\n\n\n\n       7\n              The Corps indicates that the new procurement scheme eliminates the\nfifteen-day notice period required before invitations for sealed bids, as well as the thirty-\nday response time for receipt of bids.\n\n\n2008-5034                                    22\n\fprocurement method and allows more time for actual project performance thereby\n\nminimizing schedule risks.”).\n\n      As far as administrative costs are concerned, the government notes that the\n\nSouth Atlantic Division spent $2,183,949 on procurement labor in 2006 and 2007,\n\nwhereas under the new IDIQ MATOC approach, the Corps predicts it will spend\n\n$738,026 in the next two years on procurement labor. The Corps explained in the\n\nAcquisition Plan that these savings will be particularly important because “workload has\n\nsignificantly increased over the years while personnel staffing has either remained the\n\nsame or decreased. . . . [The Corps] must implement more cost effective acquisition\n\nmethods that reduce labor intensive procedures in contracting, operations, &\n\nengineering.” Appellant’s Br. 38.\n\n      Regarding emergency procurements, the government points out that the Corps\n\nhas emphasized that the IDIQ MATOCs will allow for greater competition in emergency\n\nsituations, because a pool of contractors will be ready to bid on a given project, and\n\npreparation of task orders will require less time than the preparation of IFBs. See\n\nAcquisition Plan (“[W]ith MATOCs in place, any emergency dredging requirements\n\ncould be competed among the MATOC holders; thereby, eliminating the need for\n\nissuing costly sole source contracts.”); Appellant’s Br. 32, 38–39.    The government\n\nconcludes this will lead to greater competition, faster results, and lower costs than the\n\ncurrent emergency protocols.\n\n      With respect to improved coordination among the districts of the South Atlantic\n\nDivision, the government emphasizes that the Division currently does not coordinate\n\nsolicitations among the districts. In that regard, the Acquisition Plan notes the need to\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  23\n\f“[d]evelop a consistent methodology and process for soliciting, monitoring and\n\nadministering dredging and shore protection projects.”        It also notes the need to\n\n“[r]emove the continual struggle between the [South Atlantic Division] Districts over\n\nresources when contracting for work that falls within the same environmental windows.”\n\nBecause the IDIQ MATOCs will encompass all projects for the Division for the next five\n\nyears, no such conflicts will arise. According to the government, the Corps anticipates\n\nthat this new procurement scheme will allow it “to award a task order to a quality\n\ndredger that may be busy with work and therefore would not have submitted a sealed\n\nbid.” Appellant’s Br. 40; see also Acquisition Plan (“By having a ready pool of dredging\n\ncompanies who can do the work, [the South Atlantic Division] can more easily allow\n\nquality performance to influence the decision making process.”).\n\n      The government next argues the IDIQ MATOCs will enhance opportunities for\n\nsmall businesses because Group II is a small-business set-aside group, and the Corps\n\nwill be able to readily evaluate the small business factor because it no longer will be\n\nbound by the sealed bidding protocol of only considering price. Appellant’s Br. 42 n.9;\n\nsee also Acquisition Plan (“[The South Atlantic Division] intends to group the projects\n\nwhich have historically been set aside for small businesses and to solicit these projects\n\nunder one grouping providing for the maximum practicable number of awards to small\n\nbusinesses in every known category, thereby providing the small business community\n\nwith the same level of opportunity to compete for dredging projects as in the past.”).\n\n      Finally, the government contends that IDIQ MATOCs will promote national\n\nsecurity because task orders around military bases will be assigned quickly, and\n\ncompleted efficiently and skillfully.   The government argues that the Corps must\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   24\n\fpossess the leeway to ensure military preparedness, stating that shoaling in the\n\nSoutheast Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico was so severe in recent years that\n\nemergency contracts were issued to ensure continued navigability for military needs.\n\nSee Acquisition Plan (“Some shoaling became so severe that emergency contracts\n\nwere required in order to maintain channel depths and allow access by both commercial\n\nand military vessels.”); Appellant’s Br. 43.\n\n       Weeks counters that the Court of Federal Claims carefully analyzed and rejected\n\nthe Corps’s asserted rationales, and properly found that the MATOC solicitation lacked\n\na rational basis. As far as the selection of more competent contractors is concerned,\n\nWeeks argues that the Corps’s “technical merit” concern only addresses whether the\n\ncontractor has the appropriate equipment.           Weeks states that, even under sealed\n\nbidding, FAR § 9.104-1 provides that “a prospective contractor must—(f) have the\n\nnecessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability\n\nto obtain them.” Weeks additionally contends that the Corps’s new past performance\n\nevaluation is commensurate with the “responsibility determination” the Corps currently\n\nundertakes when evaluating contractors in sealed bidding. Weeks notes that, under the\n\nFAR, the Corps must ascertain whether each contractor has a “satisfactory performance\n\nrecord.” FAR § 9.104-3(b), 48 C.F.R. § 9-104-3(b). In that regard, it observes that FAR\n\n§ 9.104-3(b) specifically provides that when evaluating a contractor’s past performance,\n\nthe “contracting officer” should “consider the number of contracts involved and the\n\nextent of deficient performance in each contract . . . .” Id. Weeks further notes that a\n\ncontracting officer must look to the “tenacity” and “perseverance” of each contractor, id.,\n\nand that an agency can develop and utilize special, more probing responsibility\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                      25\n\fstandards, as long as those standards are published in the solicitation. FAR § 9.104-2,\n\n48 C.F.R. § 9.104-2.     Finally, Week recites that, under FAR § 9.105-1, 48 C.F.R.\n\n§ 9.105-1, an agency can obtain significant information about a contractor who is “the\n\nlow bidder” or “in range for [the] award.” Weeks urges that, under these various FAR\n\nprovisions, a procuring officer can obtain all the information he or she needs in order to\n\nevaluate a prospective contractor. Appellee’s Br. 16.\n\n      Turning to the rationale that the IDIQ MATOCs will reduce the time required for\n\nthe procurement cycle, Weeks argues that the administrative record provides no\n\nevidence that normal sealed bidding procedures have caused, or will cause,\n\nunacceptable delay. Further, Weeks disputes the government’s contention that the new\n\nprocurement scheme will save forty-five days per task order, as the South Atlantic\n\nDivision informed concerned contractors it intends to keep the present thirty-day\n\nresponse period “whenever possible.” Therefore, Weeks argues, the Corps will save a\n\nmaximum of fifteen days.\n\n      Addressing the Corps’s asserted ability to prepare task orders more quickly than\n\nsealed bids, and thus reduce procurement time, Weeks notes that the four “seed” task\n\norders, which the solicitation states will be used to evaluate the price factor, are over\n\n1500 pages in total length. According to Weeks, these task orders are similar in length\n\nto the proposals used in sealed bidding, and therefore the Corps cannot seriously\n\ncontend the new system will result in significant savings of procurement time.\n\n      Turning to administrative costs, Weeks notes that the Court of Federal Claims\n\nfound the record “lack[ed] any evidence of how the agency determined the IDIQ and\n\ntask order hours” used to evaluate those costs.      Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 33.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  26\n\fWeeks notes that § 207.170-3(ii) of the Department of Defense FAR Supplement\n\nprovides that “[s]avings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a\n\nsufficient justification for the consolidation of contract requirements unless the total\n\namount of the cost savings is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of\n\nprocurement.” In this case, Weeks states the total cost of dredging procurements is\n\napproximately $800 million for two years. Thus, Weeks posits that the savings which\n\nthe Corps projects will arise from the solicitation ($1,445,923 in savings for an $800\n\nmillion contract) will only amount to 0.18% of the two-year cost of the procurement—far\n\nbelow “substantial” savings. Id.\n\n       Continuing, Weeks states that, in a true emergency, even an IDIQ MATOC will\n\nnot suffice. According to Weeks, the Corps still will have to resort to the provisions of\n\nthe FAR because only that procurement scheme allows the Corps to move rapidly\n\nenough to meet dredging and shore protection needs in an emergency. 8 Appellee’s Br.\n\n31–32. Addressing the matter of coordination of procurement activity, Weeks indicates\n\nthat the Corps has provided no empirical evidence indicating conflicts between the\n\ndistricts of the South Atlantic Division. Id. at 34.\n\n       Next, Weeks disputes the government’s assertion that the IDIQ MATOC scheme\n\nwill benefit small businesses. First noting that small businesses received $189 million of\n\nthe $750 million spent on dredging projects over the past two years, Weeks argues that\n\nthe new plan will actually reduce the ability of small businesses to compete. Group II\n\n       8\n              For provisions addressing emergency situations, see, e.g., FAR § 6.302-2,\n48 C.F.R. § 6.302-2 (full and open competition is not required “[w]hen the agency’s\nneed for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the\nGovernment would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the\nnumber of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals”); see also FAR part 18, 48\nC.F.R. §§ 18.000–18.204 (“Emergency Acquisitions”).\n\n\n2008-5034                                     27\n\funder the MATOC scheme, the small-business set-aside group, has a bonding\n\nrequirement that ranges between $10 and $25 million.           According to Weeks, this\n\nrequirement exceeds the minimum bonding requirement the Corps normally requires for\n\nsmall businesses ($10 million). Weeks contends that any small company that can only\n\npost a $10 million bond will be precluded from competing for contracts for which it could\n\npreviously bid under sealed bidding procedures. In essence, Weeks argues that the\n\nCorps has raised bonding requirements and has added barriers to entry for small\n\nbusinesses that want to compete for dredging contracts. Appellee’s Br. 36–37. As to\n\nthe Corps’s final rationale, Weeks argues that the Corps has not “provided any evidence\n\nthat military waterways in the Southeast ever have been imperiled or jeopardized.” Id.\n\nat 37 (quoting Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 34).\n\n                                              V.\n\n       We have stated that procurement decisions “invoke[ ] ‘highly deferential’ rational\n\nbasis review.” CHE Consulting, Inc. v. United States, 552 F.3d 1351, 1354 (2008)\n\n(quoting Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, 216 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed. Cir.\n\n2000)). Under that standard, we sustain an agency action “evincing rational reasoning\n\nand consideration of relevant factors.” Advanced Data Concepts, 216 F.3d at 1058.\n\n       The Corps has presented seven reasons for its new procurement scheme. As\n\nseen, through the use of IDIQ MATOCs, the Corps expects to (1) obtain qualified\n\ncontractors; (2) reduce procurement time; (3) realize savings in administrative costs;\n\n(4) reduce or eliminate the need for emergency procurements; (5) allow for greater\n\ncoordination between the districts in the South Atlantic Division; (6) facilitate the use of\n\nsmall businesses; and (7) be able to address national security needs through more\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    28\n\ftimely execution of dredging near military bases. We think it can hardly be argued that\n\nany one of these is not a legitimate procurement objective.\n\n      Recognizing our deferential review of an agency’s procurement decision, Weeks\n\ndoes not argue that the Corps’s objectives are not legitimate.      Rather, it takes the\n\nposition that the Corps has not demonstrated that IDIQ MATOCs are necessary to\n\nachieve those objectives.    In so doing, Weeks makes much of the fact that the\n\nsolicitation and the Acquisition Plan provide little empirical evidence connecting the\n\nCorps’s needs to the new procurement scheme. For the following reasons, we are not\n\npersuaded by Weeks’s argument.\n\n      After the Court of Federal Claims decided this case, we rendered our decision in\n\nCHE Consulting. In CHE Consulting, the United States Naval Oceanic Office (“NAVO”)\n\nsought to solicit a single provider for the hardware and software maintenance of a\n\ncomplex supercomputer system. 552 F.3d at 1352. Eventually, after a request by CHE\n\nConsulting (“CHE”), the General Services Administration separated the procurement\n\ninto two contracts—one for hardware and one for software. Id. at 1353. In response to\n\nthe revised solicitation, CHE submitted a hardware maintenance proposal, but NAVO\n\nindicated it would not accept “de-bundled” proposals.     Id.   Following direction from\n\nNAVO, the General Services Administration, which had issued the solicitation, cancelled\n\nit, and issued a new solicitation requiring a single provider for both hardware and\n\nsoftware maintenance. Id. Thus, the two maintenance requirements were “bundled.”\n\n      CHE brought a protest in the Court of Federal Claims, arguing that the bundling\n\nrequirement lacked a rational basis and requesting an injunction with respect to the\n\nbundled solicitation. CHE, 552 F.3d at 1353. After examining the administrative record,\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  29\n\fthe Court of Federal Claims found the evidence supporting the new solicitation “sparse,”\n\nand requested supplementation of the record. Specifically, the court asked for a cost\n\nanalysis and empirical survey evidence on the practices of other agencies. Id. After the\n\nrecord was supplemented, the court ruled the bundling requirement had a rational basis.\n\nId. at 1353–54. Accordingly, the court rejected CHE’s challenge to the solicitation. Id.\n\n      CHE appealed. On appeal, we determined not only that NAVO established a\n\nrational basis based on the supplemented record, but also that no supplementation was\n\nrequired in the first place. Id. at 1354 (“NAVO established a rational basis to combine\n\nhardware and software services into one contract before the trial court requested\n\nsupplementation. The additions to the administrative record were thus not necessary.”).\n\nIn our decision, we pointed to several concerns about “segregating the maintenance\n\ncontracts,” which were stated in a memorandum and affidavit of NAVO’s contracting\n\nofficer representative, both of which were present in the original administrative record.\n\nId. at 1354–55. We indicated that those concerns provided a rational basis for NAVO’s\n\nprocurement, even though the documents provided no supporting evidence for the\n\nconcerns expressed. Id. at 1355. Affirming the decision of the Court of Federal Claims\n\nbased upon the original administrative record, we stated:\n\n             NAVO has no obligation to point to past experiences\n             substantiating its concerns in order to survive rational basis\n             review. . . . Indeed NAVO has a responsibility to assess risks\n             and avoid them before they become a historical fact. . . . In\n             terms of this procurement, NAVO need not suffer some\n             maintenance failures in order to substantiate its assessment\n             of risks . . . . Thus, to satisfy its obligation to supply a rational\n             basis for its decisions, NAVO may supply a reasoned\n             chronicle of its risk assessment, as it did in this case.\n\nCHE Consulting, 552 F.3d at 1355.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     30\n\f      CHE Consulting controls this case.        The Corps has put forth seven specific\n\nreasons for its procurement action, each of which represents a legitimate procurement\n\nobjective. And as seen, in the case of each reason, the Acquisition Plan states the\n\nunderlying rationale. Perhaps the Plan’s fullest statement of an underlying rationale\n\nrelates to emergency procurements. In that regard, the Acquisition Plan states that\n\n“[t]he southeastern portion of the United States, simply from its geographic proximity to\n\nwarm, tropical climatic conditions, is annually subjected to hurricanes and other\n\npotentially catastrophic natural disasters.” Continuing, the Plan explains how “during\n\nthe past several years,” hurricanes and other severe storm events have increased\n\nshoaling in many channels, and it states that some shoaling became so severe that\n\nemergency contracts were required in order to maintain channel depths and allow\n\naccess by both commercial and military vessels. The Acquisition Plan recites that many\n\nof these emergency contracts were solicited using less than full and open competition in\n\naccordance with FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.             See 48 C.F.R.\n\n§ 6.302-2. The Acquisition Plan adds that, “[b]ased upon expert technical analysis, it is\n\nanticipated that this increase in shoaling will continue into the foreseeable future.” It\n\nstates in addition that storms during the 2004 hurricane season “devastated many miles\n\nof shoreline” in North and South Carolina and Florida. This damage, the Acquisition\n\nPlan notes, resulted in the award of twenty shore protection contracts with a total value\n\nof over $98 million. The Plan concludes the discussion by stating that implementation\n\nof the MATOC procurement scheme “would virtually eliminate the need to limit\n\ncompetition in the case of natural disaster or other national emergencies.”\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  31\n\f       The Corps was required to “supply a reasoned chronicle of the risk assessment.”\n\nCHE Consulting, 552 F.3d at 1455. We think it did that by stating the reasons for its\n\nprocurement decision and the thinking behind those reasons. Put most simply, given\n\nthe Corps’s mission, and what the Acquisition Plan tells us, we conclude that the Corps\n\nhas sufficiently demonstrated that it is working to “avoid [risks] before they become\n\nhistorical fact” and that it has supplied a “reasoned chronicle of its risk assessment.”\n\n       In sum, we hold that the Corps’s decision to issue the MATOC solicitation\n\n“evince[es] rational reasoning and consideration of relevant factors.”         Were we to\n\nconclude otherwise, we would be second-guessing the Corps’s action.                 That is\n\nsomething we are not permitted to do. “‘If the court finds a reasonable basis for the\n\nagency’s action, the court should stay its hand even though it might, as an original\n\nproposition, have reached a different conclusion as to the proper administration and\n\napplication of the procurement regulations.’” Honeywell, Inc. v. United States, 870 F.2d\n\n644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (quoting M. Steinthal & Co. v. Seamans, 455 F.2d 1289, 1301\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1971)) (holding that the General Accounting Office’s determination that a bid\n\nfor a procurement contract was responsive and properly disclosed the bidder’s identity\n\nhad a rational basis). In this case, the Corps has demonstrated a rational basis for the\n\nMATOC solicitation.\n\n                                            VI.\n\n       As noted, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that the MATOC solicitation did not\n\ncomply with the Corps’s own procurement regulation, the EFARS. At the time the case\n\nwas before the court, EFARS § 16.501, S-103(a), limited the circumstances in which\n\nindefinite delivery contracts could be used. The Court of Federal Claims held that the\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   32\n\fgovernment had failed to establish that any of the specified circumstances were met\n\ninsofar as the MATOC solicitation was concerned.\n\n      On appeal, the government argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred in\n\nruling that the MATOC solicitation violated the EFARS. Weeks rejoins that the court’s\n\nruling on the EFARS issue was correct. For two reasons, however, we conclude that it\n\nis not necessary for us to address the issue. First, as noted above, Weeks stated at\n\noral argument that the case turns on the question of whether the Corps demonstrated a\n\nrational basis for its procurement action. We have held that it did. Second, on January\n\n25, 2008, after entry of the Amended Final Judgment, the Corps rescinded EFARS\n\n§ 16.501, S-103(a). Under these circumstances, even if we had not already ruled the\n\nCorps had a rational basis for its action, and we agreed with Weeks that the Corps\n\nfailed to comply with the rescinded EFARS provision, our ruling would have no practical\n\nimport, since the Corps is no longer bound by the provision.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Amended Final Judgment insofar as it\n\npermanently enjoins the Corps “from using Solicitation No. W 912EP-07-R-0007 to\n\nreceive proposals or to award negotiated IDIQ contracts or task orders for maintenance\n\ndredging or shore protection services.” Accordingly, the Corps is authorized to proceed\n\nwith the solicitation. Neither the government nor Weeks has appealed the rulings of the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims in the Amended Final Judgment with respect to the\n\npresolicitation notices issued by the Corps on November 7 and November 8, 2007. We\n\ntherefore leave those rulings undisturbed.      Thus, the Amended Final Judgment is\n\naffirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  33\n\f                  AFFIRMED-IN-PART and REVERSED-IN-PART\n\n                                      COSTS\n\n     Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   34\n\f United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n                                       2008-5034\n\n\n                                  WEEKS MARINE, INC.,\n\n                                                            Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\n                                            v.\n\n                                    UNITED STATES,\n\n                                                            Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\nAppeal from the United States Court of Federal Claims in 07-CV-700, Judge Thomas C.\nWheeler.\n\n\nDYK, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       I dissent from the majority’s holding that Weeks Marine has Article III and\n\nstatutory standing to challenge the solicitation of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n\n(“Corps”).\n\n       As described in the majority opinion, Weeks Marine filed a pre-award challenge\n\nto a solicitation by the Corps. The solicitation changed the Corps’ method of awarding\n\ndredging work in the Southeast from a competitive sealed bidding process to a process\n\ninvolving negotiated indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) multiple-award task\n\norder contracts (“MATOCs”). Weeks Marine alleged, inter alia, that the solicitation was\n\ncontrary to 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(2), which requires the use of sealed bidding procedures\n\nunder certain circumstances.      Weeks Marine made no allegations of injury in its\n\ncomplaint and appears to have filed no affidavits or declarations providing a basis for a\n\nfinding that the solicitation was likely to cause injury. In its memorandum supporting its\n\fmotions for injunctive and declaratory relief, Weeks Marine asserted it would be harmed\n\nby the “potential loss of valuable business . . . that it could otherwise obtain under the\n\nrequired sealed bidding procedures.” Mem.

Weeks Marine did not allege\n\nthat it was actually likely to be awarded less dredging work by the Corps under the\n\nsolicitation. Indeed, the majority goes to great pains to point out that Weeks Marine will\n\ncontinue to be included in the pool of prospective contractors. See Maj. Op. 12. At oral\n\nargument, Weeks Marine asserted that it had “thrived under the business model of\n\nsealed bidding and the low bidder” and “built [its] compan[y] . . . and marketing plan that\n\nway,” argued that it would be less able “to control [its] own destiny” under the Corps’\n\nnew procedure, but admitted that “we don’t know” whether the new procedure would\n\ninjure Weeks Marine. 1 Weeks Marine was unable to identify any reason that it was\n\n\n\n\n1\n       Q.

Well, we don’t know, your Honor, but here’s what we do know, you’re\n              absolutely correct that Weeks and other companies have thrived under the\n              business model of sealed bidding and the low bidder, and—and they’ve\n              built their companies and—and marketed, ah—their marketing plan that\n              way. . . .\n       ....\n       Q.     Why is it less likely that Weeks is going to be successful under this new\n              system?\n       A.     Because they can control their own destiny in having low bids with which\n              they can make money.

Cir. 2007).\n\n       Article III standing requires “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)\n\nconcrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (footnote, citations, and\n\nquotation marks omitted). Put differently, “[t]he injury alleged must be . . . ‘distinct and\n\npalpable,’ and not ‘abstract’ or ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S.\n\n737, 751 (1984) (citations omitted). Injury can be established by affidavits and other\n\nsubmissions that “present dispositively more than . . . mere ‘general averments’ and\n\n‘conclusory allegations.’” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l Servs. (TOC), Inc.,\n\n528 U.S. 167, 184 (2000).\n\n       The Supreme Court has established the requirements for pre-contract award\n\nstanding in Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America\n\nv. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993), and Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515\n\nU.S. 200, 210-12 (1995). The Supreme Court held in Associated General Contractors\n\nthat a non-minority contractor had standing to challenge a city’s practice of setting aside\n\na percentage of its contracts for bidding only by minority contractors, because “the\n\n‘injury in fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     3\n\fthe loss of a contract.” 508 U.S. at 666. Following Associated General Contractors in\n\nAdarand, the Supreme Court held that a subcontractor had standing to raise an equal\n\nprotection challenge to government financial incentives provided to general contractors\n\nhiring disadvantaged subcontractors. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 210-12. The plaintiff\n\nsubcontractor alleged that because it was not a disadvantaged subcontractor, it would\n\nsuffer future competitive harm from this practice. The Court held that the subcontractor\n\nhad satisfied the requirement that “the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III\n\npurposes—that the injury is ‘certainly impending’” because the record indicated that the\n\nsubcontractor would “very likely” bid on future contracts subject to the government’s\n\npractice and “often must compete for such contracts against small disadvantaged\n\nbusinesses.” Id. at 211-12 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 565 n.2).\n\n       The record does not show that Weeks Marine is likely to be disadvantaged by the\n\nCorps’ IDIQ MATOC solicitation. The Court of Federal Claims noted that Weeks Marine\n\n“admits that it is a ‘major player in the dredging industry’ and would likely be awarded an\n\nIDIQ contract and subsequent task orders.” Weeks Marine v. United States, 79 Fed. Cl.\n\n22, 34 (2007). Because Weeks Marine has not shown that it is likely to be awarded less\n\ndredging work under the MATOC system, its injury is “conjectural” rather than\n\n“impending.”\n\n       The majority does not suggest that Weeks Marine is less likely to receive awards\n\nunder the new procedure, or that it is likely to be injured by any reductions in the\n\namount of business it receives. The majority’s theory appears to be that the claimed\n\nillegality of the solicitation is itself sufficient to establish injury. However, the Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear that the existence of illegal conduct is not sufficient to confer\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    4\n\fstanding. “[A]n asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not\n\nsufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.” Allen, 468 U.S. at\n\n754. There must be a showing of injury in addition to a showing of illegality to satisfy\n\nthe requirements for standing, in order to “assure[] that ‘there is a real need to exercise\n\nthe power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the complaining party.’”\n\nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1149 (2009) (quoting Schlesinger v.\n\nReservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 221 (1974)).\n\n       The majority also suggests that Weeks Marine has established standing either\n\nwith its past reliance on the previous sealed bidding procedure in establishing its\n\nbusiness, or with its future reliance on the new IDIQ procedure that might later be\n\noverturned as illegal. See Maj. Op. 13, 16. According to the majority, regardless of\n\nWeeks Marine’s level of success under the new solicitation procedure, such reliance\n\nmay injure Weeks Marine’s ability to compete for dredging contracts. But reliance, like\n\nalleged illegality, cannot establish standing without a showing of injury, and the majority\n\ncites no authority establishing that mere reliance without injury is sufficient.\n\n       The majority appears to bolster its decision on the theory that Weeks Marine\n\nwould later be barred from challenging the new solicitation procedure. See Maj. Op. 18.\n\nThere are two responses. First, if Weeks Marine were later injured by the solicitation, it\n\nwould not in fact be barred from challenging the solicitation at that time. The theory that\n\nWeeks Marine’s challenge to the Corps’ MATOC solicitation would not be possible after\n\nthe IDIQ contracts and task orders had been awarded is based on a misreading of the\n\nstatutes and regulations.     Section 1491(b)(1) of Title 28 of the United States Code\n\nspecifically provides that challenges to solicitations may be brought “without regard to\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     5\n\fwhether suit is instituted before or after the contract is awarded.” To be sure, 10 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2304c(e)(1) provides that “[a] protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance\n\nof a task order or delivery order except for -- (A) a protest on the ground that the order\n\nincreases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is\n\nissued; or (B) a protest of an order valued in excess of $10,000,000.”            (emphasis\n\nadded); see also FAR ¶ 16.505(a)(9). But the statute does not limit protests of an\n\noverall solicitation or IDIQ contract; it only limits challenges to the task order or delivery\n\norder. Weeks Marine or another contractor thus could challenge the Corps’ overall\n\nsolicitation after, rather than only before, the IDIQ or task order awards. 2\n\n       Second, standing is not created by the absence of parties with proper standing.\n\n“The assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have\n\nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the\n\nWar, 418 U.S. at 227. “This view would convert standing into a requirement that must\n\nbe observed only when satisfied.”       Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 489 (1982); see also United States v.\n\nRichardson, 418 U.S. 166, 179 (1974). The fact that no party could satisfy the usual\n\n\n\n\n2\n       Our holding in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, 492 F.3d 1308 (Fed. Cir.\n2007), is not to the contrary. In Blue & Gold Fleet the bidder waited until after the\ncontract award to challenge a solicitation. We held that “a party who has the\nopportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error\nand fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the\nsame objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.” Id.\nat 1313. Our opinion in Blue & Gold Fleet does not suggest that a contractor can\nchallenge a procurement system before actually suffering or being likely to suffer an\ninjury. Blue & Gold Fleet holds only that if the contractor is injured and has the\n“opportunity to object” to the solicitation, it cannot defer its challenge to a period after\nwhich the contract is awarded.\n\n\n2008-5034                                     6\n\frequirements for standing does not create standing in a party who has not suffered\n\ninjury.\n\n                                II Lack of Statutory Standing\n\n          As the majority recognizes, the applicable statute imposes even more stringent\n\nstanding requirements. See Maj. Op. 10-11. Under the statute, the Court of Federal\n\nClaims has jurisdiction\n\n          to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a\n          solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed\n          contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged\n          violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a\n          proposed procurement . . . without regard to whether suit is instituted\n          before or after the contract is awarded.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (emphases added). In American Federation of Government\n\nEmployees v. United States, we reviewed at length the history of § 1491(b)(1) and\n\nconcluded that Congress did not intend to confer standing under the more liberal\n\nstanding rules of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702, but instead limited\n\nstanding under § 1491(b)(1) to “disappointed bidders” and to prospective bidders whose\n\nchances of securing the award would be adversely affected. 258 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2001). We stated that we “construe the term ‘interested party’ in § 1491(b)(1) in\n\naccordance with the [Competition in Contracting Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3551-56], and hold\n\nthat standing under § 1491(b)(1) is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors\n\nwhose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by\n\nfailure to award the contract.” Id. at 1302 (emphasis added).\n\n          In the case of pre-award protests, we have repeatedly limited standing under\n\n§ 1491 to those bidders who have a “substantial chance” of securing the award and who\n\nhave been disadvantaged by the government procurement decision they challenge. In\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    7\n\fRex Service Corp. v. United States, we held that a contractor did not have standing\n\nbecause it did not “establish that it had a ‘substantial chance’ of receiving the contract”\n\nand thus “prove a direct economic interest as a putative prospective bidder.” 448 F.3d\n\n1305, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Statistica, Inc. v. Christopher, 102 F.3d 1577,\n\n1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that a contractor failed to show a “substantial chance it\n\nwould have received the contract award but for” agency error). In CACI Field Services,\n\nInc. v. United States, we held that a contractor could not prevail in a pre-award bid\n\nprotest without showing prejudice from an alleged violation of a procurement statute or\n\nregulation, because “prejudice is a separate element which must be proven.” 854 F.2d\n\n464, 466 (Fed. Cir. 1988); see also Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 275 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (“[P]rejudice (or injury) is a necessary\n\nelement of standing.”).\n\n       Weeks Marine here is not a “disappointed bidder,” nor has it shown that its direct\n\neconomic interests have been adversely affected. Indeed, for all the record reveals,\n\nWeeks Marine will continue to receive exactly the same contracts that it would have\n\nreceived under the earlier sealed bidding procedure.         Allowing Weeks Marine to\n\nestablish standing without a showing of concrete injury vastly and improperly expands\n\nthe number of parties potentially qualifying for standing.\n\n       Under these circumstances, it seems to me clear that Weeks Marine does not\n\nhave Article III or statutory standing, and I respectfully dissent from the majority’s\n\ncontrary conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    8\n\f",

Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit\nJudge DYK.\n\nSCHALL, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n      The United States appeals the November 16, 2007 amended final judgment of\n\nthe United States Court of Federal Claims, which granted Weeks Marine, Inc. (“Weeks”)\n\na permanent injunction after sustaining its pre-award protest. In sustaining Weeks’s\n\nprotest, the court determined that the Army Corps of Engineers’s (“Corps’s”) solicitation\n\nfor indefinite duration indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) multiple-award task order contracts\n\n(“MATOCs”) for dredging was contrary to 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a), and lacked a rational\n\fbasis. The court also determined that the solicitation was contrary to a requirement of\n\nthe Corps’s Engineering Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“EFARS”). Weeks\n\nMarine, Inc. v. United States, No. 07-700C (Fed. Cl. Nov. 16, 2007) (“Amended Final\n\nJudgment”). For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the solicitation does not\n\nviolate § 2304(a) and does not lack a rational basis. 1       We therefore reverse the\n\nAmended Final Judgment insofar as it enjoins the Corps from proceeding with the\n\nsolicitation. In all other respects the Amended Final Judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n                                            I.\n\n      Weeks lodged its protest in response to the Corps’s solicitation relating to\n\nmaintenance dredging and shore protection work in the Corps’s South Atlantic Division.\n\nThe South Atlantic Division encompasses all or part of six states: North Carolina, South\n\nCarolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. Currently, the Division has district\n\noffices in Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia;\n\nJacksonville, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama.\n\n      Maintenance dredging removes material (for example, silt and sand) from the\n\nbottom of a navigable waterway, in order to facilitate movement of commercial,\n\npleasure, and military vessels. Shore protection restores land along the shoreline that\n\nhas been damaged by erosion or weather events by redepositing material (for example,\n\nsand) along the water’s edge.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n              As explained below, we need not decide whether the solicitation is\ncontrary to EFARS.\n\n\n2008-5034                                   2\n\f       Up until now, the Corps has awarded dredging contracts in the South Atlantic\n\nDivision on a district basis through the use of competitive sealed bidding. 2 For each\n\nproject, the district in which the work is to take place prepares an invitation for bids\n\n(“IFB”) and receives bids from multiple dredging contractors. After bid opening, the\n\ncontract is awarded solely on the basis of price and price-related factors. Each district\n\noffice within the South Atlantic Division assesses its own dredging needs and issues its\n\nown IFBs; there is little coordination between the districts.\n\n       The MATOC solicitation represents a significant departure from current Corps\n\npractice. First, the solicitation employs a negotiated, rather than sealed bidding, format.\n\nSecond, pursuant to the solicitation, multiple contractors will be awarded indefinite\n\nduration indefinite quantity multiple-award task order contracts (IDIQ MATOCs). It is\n\nenvisioned that, thereafter, an unknown number (“indefinite quantity”) of task orders will\n\nbe issued under each of the contracts. MATOC contractors will submit bids and will\n\ncompete with each other for task orders as they arise. Through the solicitation, the\n\nCorps is seeking to cover all dredging projects within the South Atlantic Division over\n\nthe next five years. 3\n\n       The Corps created an Acquisition Plan to explain its decision to switch\n\nprocurement methods, and to provide details about the procurement plan.               The\n\nAcquisition Plan lists 108 potential projects divided into four MATOC groups: Group I,\n\n\n       2\n              Currently, dredging contracts are awarded through the Savannah District\n(serving parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia), the Jacksonville District\n(serving parts of Georgia and Florida), and the Mobile District (serving parts of Georgia,\nFlorida, Alabama, and Mississippi). See U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers, South Atlantic\nDivision, available at http://www.sad.usace.army.mil/contracting.htm.\n       3\n             Upon award, each MATOC contract will have a mandatory one-year base\nterm and four one-year options. Hence, the “indefinite duration” label.\n\n\n2008-5034                                     3\n\fcertified hopper dredging projects (2–5 total MATOC contracts); 4 Group II, small\n\nbusiness set-aside projects (2–7 total MATOC contracts); Group III, shore-protection\n\nprojects (2–7 total MATOC contracts); and Group IV, other projects not listed in any of\n\nthe other three categories (2–7 total MATOC contracts). Each group has an estimated\n\ncost of between $440 million and $500 million for the full five-year period. That means\n\nthat, assuming all four option years are exercised, the total cost of the procurement will\n\nbe approximately $2 billion. The minimum task order amount is $100,000, while the\n\nmaximum is $500 million.       Although each MATOC awardee will be guaranteed a\n\ncontractual minimum of $2500, there is no guarantee that any awardee will receive\n\nmore than that amount.\n\n       The Corps will evaluate proposals it receives in response to the solicitation on a\n\n“best value” basis. The evaluation will take into account four factors: (1) technical merit,\n\n(2) past performance, (3) price, and (4) utilization of small businesses. The technical\n\nmerit factor will assess whether a party submitting a proposal possesses dredging\n\nequipment. A party’s past performance rating may vary from “very low risk,” to “very\n\nhigh risk,” with four intermediate levels.    The risk factor will assess a prospective\n\ncontractor’s competency in performing prior work (rated on a six-level scale), and the\n\nrelevancy of that work (rated on a three-level scale). As far as price is concerned, the\n\nsolicitation includes four representative tasks.    Each party submitting a proposal in\n\nresponse to the solicitation will submit a bid on one of the tasks, thereby allowing the\n\nCorps to evaluate the price factor for that party. Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (2007) (“Initial Opinion”). The Corps will pick several contractors for\n\n       4\n              Hopper dredging involves the use of specialized equipment. The Corps\nasserts only a small number of dredgers have this equipment.\n\n\n2008-5034                                    4\n\feach MATOC based on the four listed factors.           Individual task orders under the\n\nMATOCs will be awarded primarily using Low Price Technical Acceptable procedures,\n\nalthough the Corps states in the Acquisition Plan that it will use Best Value Trade Off\n\nprocedures for some tasks.\n\n       Before issuing the solicitation, the Corps “conducted market research,” in order to\n\nevaluate potential interest in the solicitation and the availability of contractors for the\n\ntask order work. Ten contractors, including Weeks, indicated interest in the solicitation.\n\nWeeks is a large marine construction and dredging company. It performed eighteen\n\ndredging contracts for the South Atlantic Division in the five years prior to the\n\nsolicitation. Weeks was one of only three contractors that expressed interest in the\n\nsolicitation that had (1) unlimited bonding capability, (2) hopper dredging equipment,\n\nand (3) significant dredging experience.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The MATOC solicitation issued on June 4, 2007.          On September 28, 2007,\n\nWeeks filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nto prevent the South Atlantic Division from moving forward with the procurement. After\n\nthe Corps filed a 2000 page administrative record, the parties filed cross motions for\n\njudgment on the administrative record. After hearing oral argument, the court issued a\n\nsealed version of its opinion on November 1, 2007. The opinion was made public on\n\nNovember 6, 2007, after the parties had a chance to review the sealed version and\n\nsubmit proposed redactions of confidential information. Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at\n\n22.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   5\n\f       In the Initial Opinion, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that the MATOC\n\nsolicitation violated 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(2), which provides that sealed bidding must be\n\nused when an agency plans to award a contract based solely on price and price-related\n\nfactors. Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 29–30. Although the Corps indicated it would be\n\nevaluating non-price-related factors, the court found that the “evaluation factors will not\n\npermit the determination of any meaningful distinctions among the offerors, nor will they\n\nallow for any different ways to make task orders awards.” Id. at 30. Thus, the court\n\nreasoned the Corps would actually be making its determination based on price. Id.\n\n       The Court of Federal Claims also ruled that the MATOC solicitation had no\n\nrational basis. Having ruled in its disposition of the § 2304(a) issue that the Corps\n\nwould not be considering non-price related factors, such as contractor qualifications, the\n\ncourt rejected the additional justifications proffered for the Corps’s procurement action.\n\nInitial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 31–34.     The government asserted the use of IDIQ\n\nMATOCs would reduce the procurement cycle, but the court found “the record\n\ncontain[ed] no evidence showing that a shortened procurement cycle would enhance\n\n[the] ability to complete projects in a timely manner.”        Id. at 32.    Although the\n\ngovernment asserted that the new procurement scheme would reduce administrative\n\ncosts by $1.5 million over two years, the court found “no evidence of how this savings is\n\ncalculated, or how it will occur.” Id. at 33. Further, the court found that the hours\n\nestimated for evaluating the proposals received in response to the solicitation were too\n\nlow for a negotiated procurement, and that administrative costs thus would likely be\n\nmuch higher than estimated. Id. The government also argued that IDIQ MATOCs\n\nwould reduce the need for emergency procurements. However, the court rejected this\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   6\n\fcontention as well, indicating that emergency procurements had constituted only 2.4\n\npercent of South Atlantic Division expenditures in the prior two years, and did not justify\n\na “procurement overhaul.” Id. Additionally, the government asserted that the IDIQ\n\nMATOCs would increase coordination between the districts in the Corps’s South\n\nAtlantic Division.   The Court of Federal Claims found, though, that the need for\n\nincreased coordination did not warrant a change from sealed bidding, but rather\n\nnecessitated the vesting of oversight in one office.      Id. at 33–34.     The court then\n\ndismissed in summary fashion all other arguments proffered by the government, stating\n\nthat the record was “devoid of credible evidence” that competition would increase, that\n\nsmall businesses would benefit, or that national security would be improved through the\n\nuse of IDIQ MATOCs. Id. The court thus concluded that the proposed solicitation\n\nlacked a rational basis. Addressing the regulatory framework, the court concluded that\n\nthe solicitation did not comply with the EFARS requirement that indefinite delivery\n\ncontracts could only be used in certain limited circumstances. Id. at 31.\n\n       Having determined that the solicitation did not comply with § 2304(a) and the\n\nEFARS, and lacked a rational basis, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that Weeks had\n\nsucceeded on the merits of its protest. The court then turned to the remaining three\n\nfactors to be considered in determining whether an injunction should issue: irreparable\n\nharm, the balance of hardships, and the public interest.

The court\n\ntherefore granted Weeks’s motion for judgment on the administrative record, and denied\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   7\n\fthe government’s motion. As a result, the court entered an order enjoining the Corps\n\n“from using Solicitation No. W 912EP-07-R-0007 to receive proposals or to award\n\nnegotiated IDIQ contracts or task orders for maintenance dredging or shore protection\n\nservices.” Id. at 37.\n\n       On November 7 and 8, 2007, the Corps issued presolicitation notices announcing\n\nindividual negotiated procurements for the same four task orders that were to be used\n\nas the basis for proposal evaluation under the enjoined solicitation.       The proposed\n\ncontracts were styled as separate negotiated procurements (as opposed to IDIQs), and\n\nthus were viewed by the Corps as eliminating the ability to issue any “follow-on task\n\norders.” Asserting that these notices violated the injunction, Weeks filed a motion to\n\nenforce or amend the November 1, 2007 judgment. It also requested an order to show\n\ncause as to why the Corps should not be found in contempt of court. The Court of\n\nFederal Claims conducted a hearing on these issues on November 15, 2007.                On\n\nNovember 16, 2007, the court vacated the November 1 injunction, and issued a new\n\norder to amend and enforce judgment. Amended Final Judgment, slip op. at 4. The\n\nnew order enjoined the Corps with respect to three of the solicitations. Id. at 3. The\n\ncourt allowed the fourth solicitation, relating to a dredging project for Kings Bay, Georgia\n\nand Fernandina Harbor, Florida, to proceed because of unique obstacles to sealed\n\nbidding at those sites. Specifically, the court noted particular “urgency surrounding this\n\nproject,” and heightened military and national security needs. Id. at 3.

Section\n\n1491(b)(1) provides that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction\n\n               to render judgment on an action by an interested party\n               objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or\n               proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or\n               the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or\n               regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed\n               procurement.

For purposes of this case, the pertinent part of § 1491(b)(1) is\n\nthat which states that an “interested party” may object “to a solicitation . . . for bids or\n\nproposals for a proposed contract” or to “any alleged violation of statute or regulation in\n\nconnection with a procurement or proposed procurement.” We have held that standing\n\nunder § 1491(b)(1) “is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct\n\neconomic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by the failure to\n\naward the contract.” Am.

It acknowledges that Weeks intends to bid on the MATOC\n\ncontracts, is able to do so, and is capable of doing the dredging work contemplated by\n\nthe contracts. At oral argument, government counsel stated, “[P]art of the standard\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   11\n\frequires that you actually be a contractor, that you have the financial wherewithal to\n\nactually bid on these projects, [and] the technical capability as well.” Oral arg. 8:20–\n\n8:40 (Jan. 7, 2009), available at http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-\n\n5034.mp3. Continuing, counsel stated that this aspect of the interested party test was\n\nnot disputed. Id. at 8:45-47. As noted, Weeks performed eighteen dredging contracts\n\nfor the South Atlantic Division in the five years prior to the solicitation. And, as also\n\nnoted, Weeks was one of only three contractors that expressed interest in the\n\nsolicitation that had (1) unlimited bonding capability, (2) hopper dredging equipment,\n\nand (3) significant dredging experience. Indeed, the government has conceded that\n\nWeeks will almost certainly be in the MATOC pool. See Appellant’s Br. 48 (“[E]ven the\n\ntrial court recognized that Weeks would likely have received one of the awards under\n\nthe MATOC.”).\n\n      Turning to the “direct economic interest” prong of the interested party test,\n\nhowever, the government argues that Weeks has failed to demonstrate prejudice or\n\nharm arising from the MATOC solicitation. According to the government, any potential\n\ninjury to Weeks is speculative, and is not the competitive injury required for standing\n\nbecause it is borne equally by all bidders. The government contends that Weeks’s\n\nallegations simply amount to a critique of IDIQ contracts in general rather than a\n\nparticularized injury due to the use of such contracts.       Appellant’s Br. 46.     The\n\ngovernment argues that Weeks has not established a “harm that ties the company’s\n\nbusiness situation to the solicitation at issue.” Oral arg. 8:20–8:25. In other words, the\n\ngovernment argues that Weeks cannot establish that there was “not only some\n\nsignificant error in the procurement process, but also that there was a substantial\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  12\n\fchance it would have received the contract but for that error.” Statistica, 102 F.3d at\n\n1582. The government urges that the “substantial chance” test is the test for proving\n\neconomic interest and prejudice, even in the pre-award context.              In making this\n\nargument, the government draws upon our standing discussions in post-award bid\n\nprotests. See, e.g., Info. Tech., 316 F.3d at 1319 (“[B]ecause the question of prejudice\n\ngoes directly to the question of standing, the prejudice issue must be reached before\n\naddressing the merits. . . . To establish prejudice, [the protestor] must show that there\n\nwas a ‘substantial chance’ it would have received the contract award but for the alleged\n\nerror in the procurement process.”); Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., 275 F.3d at\n\n1370 (“[P]rejudice (or injury) is a necessary element of standing. . . . [T]he substantial\n\nchance rule continues to apply.”).\n\n       Weeks responds that it will suffer prejudice from having to compete in a\n\n“discretionary, subjective, and essentially unreviewable process,” which, it contends,\n\nviolates applicable laws and regulations. Appellee’s Br. 41. Weeks also argues that “an\n\nunauthorized or irrational form of solicitation” will impact its ability to compete and thrive\n\nbecause it has “built [its] compan[y] and marketing plan” around the long-used system\n\nof sealed bidding. Oral arg. at 18:25–18:30. Weeks maintains further that its injury is\n\nnot merely a critique of the IDIQ procurement method, but rather stems from the\n\n“agency’s choice to use an unauthorized contract vehicle that violated procurement\n\nstatutes and regulations and lacked a rational basis.” Appellee’s Br. 50. Finally, Weeks\n\ncounters that the “substantial chance” test is inappropriate in the pre-award context\n\nbecause “[a]t the pre-award juncture, a plaintiff usually will not know who the other\n\nofferors are and may not know [its] bona fides.” Red River Serv. Corp. v. United States,\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    13\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Thus, Weeks advocates for the pre-award test articulated\n\nby the Court of Federal Claims in WinStar Communications, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), and adopted by the Court of Federal Claims in this case. In\n\nWinStar, the Court of Federal Claims stated that a prospective offeror could establish\n\nthe prejudice necessary for standing by showing “a non-trivial competitive injury which\n\ncan be redressed by judicial relief.” Id. at 763.\n\n       Section 1491(b)(1) provides in pertinent part that an “interested party” may object\n\nto a solicitation . . . for bids or proposals for a proposed contract” or to “any alleged\n\nviolation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or proposed\n\nprocurement.” As just discussed, the government does not dispute that Weeks meets\n\nthe “prospective bidder” prong of the interested party test.\n\n       We have not had occasion to discuss what is required to prove an economic\n\ninterest, and thus prejudice, in a case such as this, where a prospective bidder/offeror is\n\nchallenging a solicitation in the pre-award context. In such a case, it is difficult for a\n\nprospective bidder/offeror to make the showing of prejudice that we have required in\n\npost-award bid protest cases. See, e.g., Statistica, 102 F.3d at 1582 (holding that a\n\ncontractor lacked standing because it failed to show a “substantial chance it would have\n\nreceived the contract award but for” agency error). The reason of course is that, in a\n\ncase such as this, there have been neither bids/offers, nor a contract award. Hence,\n\nthere is no factual foundation for a “but for” prejudice analysis. However, Article III\n\nconsiderations require a party such as Weeks to make a showing of some prejudice.\n\nSee, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (1992) (“First, the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    14\n\fmust have suffered an ‘injury in fact’ . . . .”); Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., 275 F.3d\n\nat 1370 (“[P]rejudice (or injury) is a necessary element of standing.”).\n\n       The Court of Federal Claims has advocated several different standards for\n\nevaluating standing in pre-award bid protests. In Red River Service Corp., the court\n\nindicated it would follow the plain statutory language and our holding in American\n\nFederation that § 1491(b)(1) “is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors\n\nwhose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by the\n\nfailure to award the contract.” 60 Fed.

At the same time, in some pre-award cases, the Court of\n\nFederal Claims has continued to recite the substantial chance test.           See, e.g., L-3\n\nCommc’ns EOTech, Inc. v.

We therefore consider whether Weeks has demonstrated a “non-trivial\n\ncompetitive injury which can be addressed by judicial relief.” We conclude that it has.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    15\n\f       We agree with the Court of Federal Claims’s assessment of the “non-trivial\n\ncompetitive” injury faced by Weeks based upon its contention as to the illegality of the\n\nMATOC solicitation. The court stated\n\n       Weeks was one of only three contractors that had “unlimited”\n       bonding capability, “significant” dredging experience, and\n       possessed Coast Guard certified equipment for Group One\n       projects. AR 21. Under sealed bidding procedures, there is a\n       substantial chance that Weeks would be the lowest responsive and\n       responsible bidder on a significant portion of the $1,392,000,000 in\n       projects in Groups I, III, and IV. Under the IDIQ task order\n       solicitation, however, Weeks would only be guaranteed a minimum\n       of $2,500 and [the South Atlantic Division] could deny Weeks all\n       task orders for the next five years without any explanation or\n       discussions, or any ability for Weeks to seek bid protest review.\n       This non-trivial competitive injury is capable of being redressed by\n       this Court.\n\n       ....\n\n       In this case, the solicitation prevents Weeks from competing for\n       $1,392,000,000 in task order awards over the next five years\n       through sealed bidding.\n\nInitial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 35.\n\n       Weeks established an interest in bidding, sent in complaints and concerns, noted\n\nits contracting ability, and suggested it would likely receive a substantial percentage of\n\nthe contracts in sealed bidding.      Whether Weeks is the winning or losing bidder,\n\naccording to Weeks’s theory of the case the solicitation may eventually be overturned\n\ndue to illegality. This is not a pre-award case where the alleged violation is “immaterial”\n\nand will not have an impact on Weeks’s economic situation. See CACI Field Servs.,\n\nInc. v.

If the MATOC\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   16\n\fsolicitation is allowed to go forward, it will dictate Weeks’s bidding and government work\n\nin the South Atlantic Division for the next five years. In sum, Weeks is an interested\n\nparty who has demonstrated the requisite degree of prejudice for standing.             We\n\ntherefore hold that it has established standing.\n\n       Our conclusion that Weeks has standing to challenge the MATOC solicitation is\n\nconsistent, we think, with our decision in Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"210550\"><a href=\"/opinion/210550/blue-gold-fleet-lp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir. 2007).     We believe that Blue & Gold Fleet helps compel our\n\nconclusion that Weeks has statutory standing. Section 1491(b)(1) specifically confers\n\njurisdiction on the Court of Federal Claims to hear pre-award bid protests, stating an\n\n“interested party” may object to “any alleged violation of statute or regulation in\n\nconnection with a procurement or proposed procurement.” In Blue & Gold Fleet we held\n\n“that a party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation\n\ncontaining a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process\n\nwaives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims.” 492 F.3d at 1313. In Blue & Gold Fleet, the government\n\nissued a solicitation for, inter alia, “ferry transportation” and “concessions” services at\n\nAlcatraz Island. Id. at 1311. After Blue & Gold lost the contract, it filed a protest\n\nindicating that the awardee had not properly included in its bid “the wages and benefits\n\nfor its employees required by the Services Contract Act.” Id. at 1312. The Court of\n\nFederal Claims concluded that Blue & Gold was actually challenging the terms of the\n\nsolicitation, and thus had waived its opportunity to protest. We agreed, noting that the\n\nsolicitation itself “did not include any requirement that the bidders consider the Service\n\nContract Act.” Id. at 1313. Thus, Blue & Gold was actually challenging the terms and\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   17\n\frequirements of the solicitation. In holding that Blue & Gold had waived its opportunity\n\nto protest, we noted the GAO regulation, 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1), indicating that GAO\n\nprotests “based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to\n\n. . . the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to . . . the time set for\n\nreceipt of initial proposals.” Blue & Gold Fleet, 492 F.3d at 1314. We stated that\n\n“‘[v]endors cannot sit on their rights to challenge what they believe is an unfair\n\nsolicitation, roll the dice and see if they receive the award . . . .’” Id. (quoting Argencord\n\nMach. & Equip. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Such a\n\nresult would be anomalous.\n\n       Finally, by its terms, § 1491(b)(1) indicates that interested parties are able to\n\nchallenge facial defects in solicitations. Cf.

Cir. 1999) (“If § 1491(b) required a challenge to the merits of\n\nthe contract award, the contractor would never need to use the ‘violation’ prong but\n\ncould always rely on other jurisdictional grants in § 1491(b)(1).”). Thus, in some cases\n\nthe injury stemming from a facially illegal solicitation may in and of itself be enough to\n\nestablish standing; in such a case a bidder should not have to wait until the solicitation\n\nis applied unfavorably to establish injury.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                      18\n\f        For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that in a pre-award protest such as the\n\none before us, prospective bidder or offeror must establish “a non-trivial competitive\n\ninjury which can be redressed by judicial relief” to meet the standing requirement of\n\n§ 1491(b)(1). Under that standard, we hold that Weeks has standing to challenge the\n\nMATOC solicitation in the Court of Federal Claims. We turn now to the merits.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        We first address Weeks’s contention that the MATOC solicitation violates\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2304(a). Section 2304(a) provides that, in conducting a procurement for\n\nproperty or services, an agency “shall obtain full and open competition through the use\n\nof competitive procedures.” 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(1)(A). The statute directs agencies to\n\n“use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best\n\nsuited under the circumstances of the procurement.” Id. § 2304(a)(1)(B). In that regard,\n\nit states:\n\n              (2) In determining the competitive procedure appropriate\n              under the circumstances, the head of an agency—\n                     (A) shall solicit sealed bids if—\n                            (i) time permits the solicitation, submission,\n                            and evaluation of sealed bids;\n                            (ii) the award will be made on the basis of price\n                            and other price-related factors;\n                            (iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions\n                            with the responding sources about their bids;\n                            and\n                            (iv) there is a reasonable expectation of\n                            receiving more than one sealed bid; and\n                     (B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids\n                     are not appropriate under clause (A).\n\nId. § 2304(a)(2).\n\n        On appeal, the government argues that, on its face, the MATOC solicitation\n\nconsiders non-price-related factors, and that therefore the Corps is using a negotiated\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   19\n\fprocurement under § 2304(a)(2)(B). Specifically, the government contends the Corps is\n\naddressing (1) technical merit, (2) past performance, and (3) small business concerns.\n\nThe solicitation, the government notes, states that “past performance is considered\n\nsignificantly more important than price” and that “all evaluation factors, when combined,\n\nare significantly more important than price.”      Weeks responds that while the Corps\n\nstates that it will be evaluating non-price factors, and that the solicitation thus falls under\n\n§ 2304(a)(2)(B), a closer look at the solicitation and the dredging industry reveals that\n\nthe Corps will continue to limit its inquiry to price and price-related factors only. Thus,\n\nWeeks contends the solicitation is covered by § 2304(a)(2)(A) and that sealed bidding is\n\nrequired.\n\n       We conclude that Weeks has not established a violation of § 2304(a).               The\n\nsolicitation expressly states that the Corps will consider non-price factors, and that past\n\nperformance is “significantly more important than price.” In addition, in the solicitation\n\nthe Corps explained how it will evaluate technical merit, past performance, and small\n\nbusiness factors. Moreover, Weeks acknowledged at oral argument that, its arguments\n\nrelating to the Corps’s intentions notwithstanding, the Corps has complied with the\n\nrequirements of § 2304(a):\n\n              The Court: “It does on its face say ‘we’re going to consider\n              non-price-related factors’—isn’t that the end of it?”\n              Weeks: “Facially yes . . . they have satisfied what the statute\n              requires . . . .”\n              The Court: “Doesn’t the case then come down to whether\n              the government established a rational basis for the\n              structuring of the procurement?\n              Weeks: “Yes, I believe it does . . . I think that is more what\n              the case is about.”\n\nOral arg. at 30:51-31:21. It is to the issue of rational basis that we now turn.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     20\n\f                                             IV.\n\n       The government argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred in ruling the\n\nCorps’s procurement action lacked a rational basis.          In making this argument, it\n\ncontends that the court should not have dismissed the Corps’s reasons for switching to\n\na negotiated procurement scheme. The government argues, as it did in the Court of\n\nFederal Claims, that the IDIQ MATOCs will allow the Corps to (1) pick more qualified\n\ncontractors because it will be able to rely on factors other than price; (2) reduce\n\nprocurement time; (3) lower administrative costs by an estimated $1.45 million in the\n\nnext two years; (4) reduce or eliminate the need for emergency procurements; (5) have\n\ngreater coordination between individual districts of the South Atlantic Division;\n\n(6) facilitate the use of small businesses; and (7) promote national security through\n\nmore timely execution of dredging near military bases.\n\n       Addressing its first rationale, the government argues that the responsibility\n\ndeterminations the Corps currently is required to make pursuant to Federal Acquisition\n\nRegulation (“FAR”) § 9.401-1, 48 C.F.R. § 9.104-1, when there is sealed bidding, are\n\nnot adequate surrogates for the evaluations of past performance it requires. 6 According\n\nto the government, a FAR responsibility determination only addresses whether a\n\ncontractor has a “satisfactory performance record.” By contrast, the MATOC negotiated\n\nprocurement scheme, it is urged, will allow for more nuanced evaluations.                  A\n\nprospective contractor may receive different ratings for various criteria, and the Corps\n\nwill have the flexibility to weigh different factors as it sees fit. The government indicates\n\nthat the more detailed rating system for competency and relevancy in the MATOC\n\n       6\n              FAR § 9.104-1 provides that a contractor must satisfy seven criteria in\norder to be deemed “responsible.”\n\n\n2008-5034                                    21\n\fsolicitation will allow the Corps to avoid hiring contractors who may do “satisfactory”\n\nwork, but may not have the particular expertise needed to perform certain dredging\n\njobs. Through the consideration of past performance, the government contends the\n\nCorps will be able to have dredging work done by contractors with the highest skills and\n\nwho offer the best value. See Acquisition Plan at 2 (“It has become increasingly difficult\n\nin today’s operating environment to obtain bids from responsible contractors capable of\n\nmeeting performance requirements and time constraints.”).\n\n       As to reduction in procurement time, the government states that “time is of the\n\nessence” because (1) “environmental windows compress the schedule for dredging in\n\nmuch of the South Atlantic region,” and (2) unplanned events often arise that call for\n\nincreased flexibility. The Corps estimates the IDIQ solicitation method could save as\n\nmuch as forty-five days per project in terms of the bidding period alone. 7             See\n\nAcquisition Plan (“It is estimated that this contracting mechanism will save as much as\n\n45 days in the procurement cycle of each project.”). Further, the government argues\n\nthat the new procurement scheme will “spare [the South Atlantic Division] from the need\n\nto construct time-intensive Invitation[s] for Bids, since a task order can be created more\n\nquickly,” thus saving additional time and resources. Appellant’s Br. 30; see Acquisition\n\nPlan (“[T]here is limited time to prepare the invitation for bid . . . or the request for\n\nproposal . . . . This will be mitigated by the development of IDIQs which allow for a\n\nsignificant reduction in acquisition time. In addition, issuance of task orders is a faster\n\n\n\n\n       7\n              The Corps indicates that the new procurement scheme eliminates the\nfifteen-day notice period required before invitations for sealed bids, as well as the thirty-\nday response time for receipt of bids.\n\n\n2008-5034                                    22\n\fprocurement method and allows more time for actual project performance thereby\n\nminimizing schedule risks.”).\n\n      As far as administrative costs are concerned, the government notes that the\n\nSouth Atlantic Division spent $2,183,949 on procurement labor in 2006 and 2007,\n\nwhereas under the new IDIQ MATOC approach, the Corps predicts it will spend\n\n$738,026 in the next two years on procurement labor. The Corps explained in the\n\nAcquisition Plan that these savings will be particularly important because “workload has\n\nsignificantly increased over the years while personnel staffing has either remained the\n\nsame or decreased. . . . [The Corps] must implement more cost effective acquisition\n\nmethods that reduce labor intensive procedures in contracting, operations, &\n\nengineering.” Appellant’s Br. 38.\n\n      Regarding emergency procurements, the government points out that the Corps\n\nhas emphasized that the IDIQ MATOCs will allow for greater competition in emergency\n\nsituations, because a pool of contractors will be ready to bid on a given project, and\n\npreparation of task orders will require less time than the preparation of IFBs. See\n\nAcquisition Plan (“[W]ith MATOCs in place, any emergency dredging requirements\n\ncould be competed among the MATOC holders; thereby, eliminating the need for\n\nissuing costly sole source contracts.”); Appellant’s Br. 32, 38–39.    The government\n\nconcludes this will lead to greater competition, faster results, and lower costs than the\n\ncurrent emergency protocols.\n\n      With respect to improved coordination among the districts of the South Atlantic\n\nDivision, the government emphasizes that the Division currently does not coordinate\n\nsolicitations among the districts. In that regard, the Acquisition Plan notes the need to\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  23\n\f“[d]evelop a consistent methodology and process for soliciting, monitoring and\n\nadministering dredging and shore protection projects.”        It also notes the need to\n\n“[r]emove the continual struggle between the [South Atlantic Division] Districts over\n\nresources when contracting for work that falls within the same environmental windows.”\n\nBecause the IDIQ MATOCs will encompass all projects for the Division for the next five\n\nyears, no such conflicts will arise. According to the government, the Corps anticipates\n\nthat this new procurement scheme will allow it “to award a task order to a quality\n\ndredger that may be busy with work and therefore would not have submitted a sealed\n\nbid.” Appellant’s Br. 40; see also Acquisition Plan (“By having a ready pool of dredging\n\ncompanies who can do the work, [the South Atlantic Division] can more easily allow\n\nquality performance to influence the decision making process.”).\n\n      The government next argues the IDIQ MATOCs will enhance opportunities for\n\nsmall businesses because Group II is a small-business set-aside group, and the Corps\n\nwill be able to readily evaluate the small business factor because it no longer will be\n\nbound by the sealed bidding protocol of only considering price. Appellant’s Br. 42 n.9;\n\nsee also Acquisition Plan (“[The South Atlantic Division] intends to group the projects\n\nwhich have historically been set aside for small businesses and to solicit these projects\n\nunder one grouping providing for the maximum practicable number of awards to small\n\nbusinesses in every known category, thereby providing the small business community\n\nwith the same level of opportunity to compete for dredging projects as in the past.”).\n\n      Finally, the government contends that IDIQ MATOCs will promote national\n\nsecurity because task orders around military bases will be assigned quickly, and\n\ncompleted efficiently and skillfully.   The government argues that the Corps must\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   24\n\fpossess the leeway to ensure military preparedness, stating that shoaling in the\n\nSoutheast Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico was so severe in recent years that\n\nemergency contracts were issued to ensure continued navigability for military needs.\n\nSee Acquisition Plan (“Some shoaling became so severe that emergency contracts\n\nwere required in order to maintain channel depths and allow access by both commercial\n\nand military vessels.”); Appellant’s Br. 43.\n\n       Weeks counters that the Court of Federal Claims carefully analyzed and rejected\n\nthe Corps’s asserted rationales, and properly found that the MATOC solicitation lacked\n\na rational basis. As far as the selection of more competent contractors is concerned,\n\nWeeks argues that the Corps’s “technical merit” concern only addresses whether the\n\ncontractor has the appropriate equipment.           Weeks states that, even under sealed\n\nbidding, FAR § 9.104-1 provides that “a prospective contractor must—(f) have the\n\nnecessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability\n\nto obtain them.” Weeks additionally contends that the Corps’s new past performance\n\nevaluation is commensurate with the “responsibility determination” the Corps currently\n\nundertakes when evaluating contractors in sealed bidding. Weeks notes that, under the\n\nFAR, the Corps must ascertain whether each contractor has a “satisfactory performance\n\nrecord.” FAR § 9.104-3(b), 48 C.F.R. § 9-104-3(b). In that regard, it observes that FAR\n\n§ 9.104-3(b) specifically provides that when evaluating a contractor’s past performance,\n\nthe “contracting officer” should “consider the number of contracts involved and the\n\nextent of deficient performance in each contract . . . .” Id. Weeks further notes that a\n\ncontracting officer must look to the “tenacity” and “perseverance” of each contractor, id.,\n\nand that an agency can develop and utilize special, more probing responsibility\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                      25\n\fstandards, as long as those standards are published in the solicitation. FAR § 9.104-2,\n\n48 C.F.R. § 9.104-2.     Finally, Week recites that, under FAR § 9.105-1, 48 C.F.R.\n\n§ 9.105-1, an agency can obtain significant information about a contractor who is “the\n\nlow bidder” or “in range for [the] award.” Weeks urges that, under these various FAR\n\nprovisions, a procuring officer can obtain all the information he or she needs in order to\n\nevaluate a prospective contractor. Appellee’s Br. 16.\n\n      Turning to the rationale that the IDIQ MATOCs will reduce the time required for\n\nthe procurement cycle, Weeks argues that the administrative record provides no\n\nevidence that normal sealed bidding procedures have caused, or will cause,\n\nunacceptable delay. Further, Weeks disputes the government’s contention that the new\n\nprocurement scheme will save forty-five days per task order, as the South Atlantic\n\nDivision informed concerned contractors it intends to keep the present thirty-day\n\nresponse period “whenever possible.” Therefore, Weeks argues, the Corps will save a\n\nmaximum of fifteen days.\n\n      Addressing the Corps’s asserted ability to prepare task orders more quickly than\n\nsealed bids, and thus reduce procurement time, Weeks notes that the four “seed” task\n\norders, which the solicitation states will be used to evaluate the price factor, are over\n\n1500 pages in total length. According to Weeks, these task orders are similar in length\n\nto the proposals used in sealed bidding, and therefore the Corps cannot seriously\n\ncontend the new system will result in significant savings of procurement time.\n\n      Turning to administrative costs, Weeks notes that the Court of Federal Claims\n\nfound the record “lack[ed] any evidence of how the agency determined the IDIQ and\n\ntask order hours” used to evaluate those costs.      Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 33.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  26\n\fWeeks notes that § 207.170-3(ii) of the Department of Defense FAR Supplement\n\nprovides that “[s]avings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a\n\nsufficient justification for the consolidation of contract requirements unless the total\n\namount of the cost savings is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of\n\nprocurement.” In this case, Weeks states the total cost of dredging procurements is\n\napproximately $800 million for two years. Thus, Weeks posits that the savings which\n\nthe Corps projects will arise from the solicitation ($1,445,923 in savings for an $800\n\nmillion contract) will only amount to 0.18% of the two-year cost of the procurement—far\n\nbelow “substantial” savings. Id.\n\n       Continuing, Weeks states that, in a true emergency, even an IDIQ MATOC will\n\nnot suffice. According to Weeks, the Corps still will have to resort to the provisions of\n\nthe FAR because only that procurement scheme allows the Corps to move rapidly\n\nenough to meet dredging and shore protection needs in an emergency. 8 Appellee’s Br.\n\n31–32. Addressing the matter of coordination of procurement activity, Weeks indicates\n\nthat the Corps has provided no empirical evidence indicating conflicts between the\n\ndistricts of the South Atlantic Division. Id. at 34.\n\n       Next, Weeks disputes the government’s assertion that the IDIQ MATOC scheme\n\nwill benefit small businesses. First noting that small businesses received $189 million of\n\nthe $750 million spent on dredging projects over the past two years, Weeks argues that\n\nthe new plan will actually reduce the ability of small businesses to compete. Group II\n\n       8\n              For provisions addressing emergency situations, see, e.g., FAR § 6.302-2,\n48 C.F.R. § 6.302-2 (full and open competition is not required “[w]hen the agency’s\nneed for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the\nGovernment would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the\nnumber of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals”); see also FAR part 18, 48\nC.F.R. §§ 18.000–18.204 (“Emergency Acquisitions”).\n\n\n2008-5034                                     27\n\funder the MATOC scheme, the small-business set-aside group, has a bonding\n\nrequirement that ranges between $10 and $25 million.           According to Weeks, this\n\nrequirement exceeds the minimum bonding requirement the Corps normally requires for\n\nsmall businesses ($10 million). Weeks contends that any small company that can only\n\npost a $10 million bond will be precluded from competing for contracts for which it could\n\npreviously bid under sealed bidding procedures. In essence, Weeks argues that the\n\nCorps has raised bonding requirements and has added barriers to entry for small\n\nbusinesses that want to compete for dredging contracts. Appellee’s Br. 36–37. As to\n\nthe Corps’s final rationale, Weeks argues that the Corps has not “provided any evidence\n\nthat military waterways in the Southeast ever have been imperiled or jeopardized.” Id.\n\nat 37 (quoting Initial Opinion, 79 Fed. Cl. at 34).\n\n                                              V.\n\n       We have stated that procurement decisions “invoke[ ] ‘highly deferential’ rational\n\nbasis review.” CHE Consulting, Inc. v.

Under that standard, we sustain an agency action “evincing rational reasoning\n\nand consideration of relevant factors.” Advanced Data Concepts, 216 F.3d at 1058.\n\n       The Corps has presented seven reasons for its new procurement scheme. As\n\nseen, through the use of IDIQ MATOCs, the Corps expects to (1) obtain qualified\n\ncontractors; (2) reduce procurement time; (3) realize savings in administrative costs;\n\n(4) reduce or eliminate the need for emergency procurements; (5) allow for greater\n\ncoordination between the districts in the South Atlantic Division; (6) facilitate the use of\n\nsmall businesses; and (7) be able to address national security needs through more\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    28\n\ftimely execution of dredging near military bases. We think it can hardly be argued that\n\nany one of these is not a legitimate procurement objective.\n\n      Recognizing our deferential review of an agency’s procurement decision, Weeks\n\ndoes not argue that the Corps’s objectives are not legitimate.      Rather, it takes the\n\nposition that the Corps has not demonstrated that IDIQ MATOCs are necessary to\n\nachieve those objectives.    In so doing, Weeks makes much of the fact that the\n\nsolicitation and the Acquisition Plan provide little empirical evidence connecting the\n\nCorps’s needs to the new procurement scheme. For the following reasons, we are not\n\npersuaded by Weeks’s argument.\n\n      After the Court of Federal Claims decided this case, we rendered our decision in\n\nCHE Consulting. In CHE Consulting, the United States Naval Oceanic Office (“NAVO”)\n\nsought to solicit a single provider for the hardware and software maintenance of a\n\ncomplex supercomputer system. 552 F.3d at 1352. Eventually, after a request by CHE\n\nConsulting (“CHE”), the General Services Administration separated the procurement\n\ninto two contracts—one for hardware and one for software. Id. at 1353. In response to\n\nthe revised solicitation, CHE submitted a hardware maintenance proposal, but NAVO\n\nindicated it would not accept “de-bundled” proposals.     Id.   Following direction from\n\nNAVO, the General Services Administration, which had issued the solicitation, cancelled\n\nit, and issued a new solicitation requiring a single provider for both hardware and\n\nsoftware maintenance. Id. Thus, the two maintenance requirements were “bundled.”\n\n      CHE brought a protest in the Court of Federal Claims, arguing that the bundling\n\nrequirement lacked a rational basis and requesting an injunction with respect to the\n\nbundled solicitation. CHE, 552 F.3d at 1353. After examining the administrative record,\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  29\n\fthe Court of Federal Claims found the evidence supporting the new solicitation “sparse,”\n\nand requested supplementation of the record. Specifically, the court asked for a cost\n\nanalysis and empirical survey evidence on the practices of other agencies. Id. After the\n\nrecord was supplemented, the court ruled the bundling requirement had a rational basis.\n\nId. at 1353–54. Accordingly, the court rejected CHE’s challenge to the solicitation. Id.\n\n      CHE appealed. On appeal, we determined not only that NAVO established a\n\nrational basis based on the supplemented record, but also that no supplementation was\n\nrequired in the first place. Id. at 1354 (“NAVO established a rational basis to combine\n\nhardware and software services into one contract before the trial court requested\n\nsupplementation. The additions to the administrative record were thus not necessary.”).\n\nIn our decision, we pointed to several concerns about “segregating the maintenance\n\ncontracts,” which were stated in a memorandum and affidavit of NAVO’s contracting\n\nofficer representative, both of which were present in the original administrative record.\n\nId. at 1354–55. We indicated that those concerns provided a rational basis for NAVO’s\n\nprocurement, even though the documents provided no supporting evidence for the\n\nconcerns expressed. Id. at 1355. Affirming the decision of the Court of Federal Claims\n\nbased upon the original administrative record, we stated:\n\n             NAVO has no obligation to point to past experiences\n             substantiating its concerns in order to survive rational basis\n             review. . . . Indeed NAVO has a responsibility to assess risks\n             and avoid them before they become a historical fact. . . . In\n             terms of this procurement, NAVO need not suffer some\n             maintenance failures in order to substantiate its assessment\n             of risks . . . . Thus, to satisfy its obligation to supply a rational\n             basis for its decisions, NAVO may supply a reasoned\n             chronicle of its risk assessment, as it did in this case.\n\nCHE Consulting, 552 F.3d at 1355.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     30\n\f      CHE Consulting controls this case.        The Corps has put forth seven specific\n\nreasons for its procurement action, each of which represents a legitimate procurement\n\nobjective. And as seen, in the case of each reason, the Acquisition Plan states the\n\nunderlying rationale. Perhaps the Plan’s fullest statement of an underlying rationale\n\nrelates to emergency procurements. In that regard, the Acquisition Plan states that\n\n“[t]he southeastern portion of the United States, simply from its geographic proximity to\n\nwarm, tropical climatic conditions, is annually subjected to hurricanes and other\n\npotentially catastrophic natural disasters.” Continuing, the Plan explains how “during\n\nthe past several years,” hurricanes and other severe storm events have increased\n\nshoaling in many channels, and it states that some shoaling became so severe that\n\nemergency contracts were required in order to maintain channel depths and allow\n\naccess by both commercial and military vessels. The Acquisition Plan recites that many\n\nof these emergency contracts were solicited using less than full and open competition in\n\naccordance with FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.             See 48 C.F.R.\n\n§ 6.302-2. The Acquisition Plan adds that, “[b]ased upon expert technical analysis, it is\n\nanticipated that this increase in shoaling will continue into the foreseeable future.” It\n\nstates in addition that storms during the 2004 hurricane season “devastated many miles\n\nof shoreline” in North and South Carolina and Florida. This damage, the Acquisition\n\nPlan notes, resulted in the award of twenty shore protection contracts with a total value\n\nof over $98 million. The Plan concludes the discussion by stating that implementation\n\nof the MATOC procurement scheme “would virtually eliminate the need to limit\n\ncompetition in the case of natural disaster or other national emergencies.”\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  31\n\f       The Corps was required to “supply a reasoned chronicle of the risk assessment.”\n\nCHE Consulting, 552 F.3d at 1455. We think it did that by stating the reasons for its\n\nprocurement decision and the thinking behind those reasons. Put most simply, given\n\nthe Corps’s mission, and what the Acquisition Plan tells us, we conclude that the Corps\n\nhas sufficiently demonstrated that it is working to “avoid [risks] before they become\n\nhistorical fact” and that it has supplied a “reasoned chronicle of its risk assessment.”\n\n       In sum, we hold that the Corps’s decision to issue the MATOC solicitation\n\n“evince[es] rational reasoning and consideration of relevant factors.”         Were we to\n\nconclude otherwise, we would be second-guessing the Corps’s action.                 That is\n\nsomething we are not permitted to do. “‘If the court finds a reasonable basis for the\n\nagency’s action, the court should stay its hand even though it might, as an original\n\nproposition, have reached a different conclusion as to the proper administration and\n\napplication of the procurement regulations.’” Honeywell, Inc. v.

In this case, the Corps has demonstrated a rational basis for the\n\nMATOC solicitation.\n\n                                            VI.\n\n       As noted, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that the MATOC solicitation did not\n\ncomply with the Corps’s own procurement regulation, the EFARS. At the time the case\n\nwas before the court, EFARS § 16.501, S-103(a), limited the circumstances in which\n\nindefinite delivery contracts could be used. The Court of Federal Claims held that the\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   32\n\fgovernment had failed to establish that any of the specified circumstances were met\n\ninsofar as the MATOC solicitation was concerned.\n\n      On appeal, the government argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred in\n\nruling that the MATOC solicitation violated the EFARS. Weeks rejoins that the court’s\n\nruling on the EFARS issue was correct. For two reasons, however, we conclude that it\n\nis not necessary for us to address the issue. First, as noted above, Weeks stated at\n\noral argument that the case turns on the question of whether the Corps demonstrated a\n\nrational basis for its procurement action. We have held that it did. Second, on January\n\n25, 2008, after entry of the Amended Final Judgment, the Corps rescinded EFARS\n\n§ 16.501, S-103(a). Under these circumstances, even if we had not already ruled the\n\nCorps had a rational basis for its action, and we agreed with Weeks that the Corps\n\nfailed to comply with the rescinded EFARS provision, our ruling would have no practical\n\nimport, since the Corps is no longer bound by the provision.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Amended Final Judgment insofar as it\n\npermanently enjoins the Corps “from using Solicitation No. W 912EP-07-R-0007 to\n\nreceive proposals or to award negotiated IDIQ contracts or task orders for maintenance\n\ndredging or shore protection services.” Accordingly, the Corps is authorized to proceed\n\nwith the solicitation. Neither the government nor Weeks has appealed the rulings of the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims in the Amended Final Judgment with respect to the\n\npresolicitation notices issued by the Corps on November 7 and November 8, 2007. We\n\ntherefore leave those rulings undisturbed.      Thus, the Amended Final Judgment is\n\naffirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                  33\n\f                  AFFIRMED-IN-PART and REVERSED-IN-PART\n\n                                      COSTS\n\n     Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   34\n\f United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n                                       2008-5034\n\n\n                                  WEEKS MARINE, INC.,\n\n                                                            Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\n                                            v.\n\n                                    UNITED STATES,\n\n                                                            Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\nAppeal from the United States Court of Federal Claims in 07-CV-700, Judge Thomas C.\nWheeler.\n\n\nDYK, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       I dissent from the majority’s holding that Weeks Marine has Article III and\n\nstatutory standing to challenge the solicitation of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n\n(“Corps”).\n\n       As described in the majority opinion, Weeks Marine filed a pre-award challenge\n\nto a solicitation by the Corps. The solicitation changed the Corps’ method of awarding\n\ndredging work in the Southeast from a competitive sealed bidding process to a process\n\ninvolving negotiated indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) multiple-award task\n\norder contracts (“MATOCs”). Weeks Marine alleged, inter alia, that the solicitation was\n\ncontrary to 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(2), which requires the use of sealed bidding procedures\n\nunder certain circumstances.      Weeks Marine made no allegations of injury in its\n\ncomplaint and appears to have filed no affidavits or declarations providing a basis for a\n\nfinding that the solicitation was likely to cause injury. In its memorandum supporting its\n\fmotions for injunctive and declaratory relief, Weeks Marine asserted it would be harmed\n\nby the “potential loss of valuable business . . . that it could otherwise obtain under the\n\nrequired sealed bidding procedures.” Mem. P. & A. Supp. Pl.’s Mot. for TRO, Prelim.\n\nInj., Permanent Inj. & Declaratory J. at 28, Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States, 79 Fed.\n\nCl. 22 (Fed. Cl. 2007) (No. 07-700C) (emphasis added). Weeks Marine did not allege\n\nthat it was actually likely to be awarded less dredging work by the Corps under the\n\nsolicitation. Indeed, the majority goes to great pains to point out that Weeks Marine will\n\ncontinue to be included in the pool of prospective contractors. See Maj. Op. 12. At oral\n\nargument, Weeks Marine asserted that it had “thrived under the business model of\n\nsealed bidding and the low bidder” and “built [its] compan[y] . . . and marketing plan that\n\nway,” argued that it would be less able “to control [its] own destiny” under the Corps’\n\nnew procedure, but admitted that “we don’t know” whether the new procedure would\n\ninjure Weeks Marine. 1 Weeks Marine was unable to identify any reason that it was\n\n\n\n\n1\n       Q.

Well, we don’t know, your Honor, but here’s what we do know, you’re\n              absolutely correct that Weeks and other companies have thrived under the\n              business model of sealed bidding and the low bidder, and—and they’ve\n              built their companies and—and marketed, ah—their marketing plan that\n              way. . . .\n       ....\n       Q.     Why is it less likely that Weeks is going to be successful under this new\n              system?\n       A.     Because they can control their own destiny in having low bids with which\n              they can make money. They can’t control their destiny when the Corps of\n              Engineers is going to introduce subjective evaluations on things other than\n              price.\n\nOral Arg. 18:00-18:31, 19:30-19:54.\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                   2\n\flikely to lose business as a result of the change in procedures, or how it was\n\ndisadvantaged compared to other bidders.\n\n                               I Lack of Article III Standing\n\n       The government asserts that Weeks Marine lacks standing.

The Supreme Court held in Associated General Contractors\n\nthat a non-minority contractor had standing to challenge a city’s practice of setting aside\n\na percentage of its contracts for bidding only by minority contractors, because “the\n\n‘injury in fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     3\n\fthe loss of a contract.” 508 U.S. at 666. Following Associated General Contractors in\n\nAdarand, the Supreme Court held that a subcontractor had standing to raise an equal\n\nprotection challenge to government financial incentives provided to general contractors\n\nhiring disadvantaged subcontractors. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 210-12. The plaintiff\n\nsubcontractor alleged that because it was not a disadvantaged subcontractor, it would\n\nsuffer future competitive harm from this practice. The Court held that the subcontractor\n\nhad satisfied the requirement that “the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III\n\npurposes—that the injury is ‘certainly impending’” because the record indicated that the\n\nsubcontractor would “very likely” bid on future contracts subject to the government’s\n\npractice and “often must compete for such contracts against small disadvantaged\n\nbusinesses.” Id. at 211-12 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 565 n.2).\n\n       The record does not show that Weeks Marine is likely to be disadvantaged by the\n\nCorps’ IDIQ MATOC solicitation. The Court of Federal Claims noted that Weeks Marine\n\n“admits that it is a ‘major player in the dredging industry’ and would likely be awarded an\n\nIDIQ contract and subsequent task orders.” Weeks Marine v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (2007). Because Weeks Marine has not shown that it is likely to be awarded less\n\ndredging work under the MATOC system, its injury is “conjectural” rather than\n\n“impending.”\n\n       The majority does not suggest that Weeks Marine is less likely to receive awards\n\nunder the new procedure, or that it is likely to be injured by any reductions in the\n\namount of business it receives. The majority’s theory appears to be that the claimed\n\nillegality of the solicitation is itself sufficient to establish injury. However, the Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear that the existence of illegal conduct is not sufficient to confer\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    4\n\fstanding. “[A]n asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not\n\nsufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.” Allen, 468 U.S. at\n\n754. There must be a showing of injury in addition to a showing of illegality to satisfy\n\nthe requirements for standing, in order to “assure[] that ‘there is a real need to exercise\n\nthe power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the complaining party.’”\n\nSummers v.

See Maj. Op. 13, 16. According to the majority, regardless of\n\nWeeks Marine’s level of success under the new solicitation procedure, such reliance\n\nmay injure Weeks Marine’s ability to compete for dredging contracts. But reliance, like\n\nalleged illegality, cannot establish standing without a showing of injury, and the majority\n\ncites no authority establishing that mere reliance without injury is sufficient.\n\n       The majority appears to bolster its decision on the theory that Weeks Marine\n\nwould later be barred from challenging the new solicitation procedure. See Maj. Op. 18.\n\nThere are two responses. First, if Weeks Marine were later injured by the solicitation, it\n\nwould not in fact be barred from challenging the solicitation at that time. The theory that\n\nWeeks Marine’s challenge to the Corps’ MATOC solicitation would not be possible after\n\nthe IDIQ contracts and task orders had been awarded is based on a misreading of the\n\nstatutes and regulations.     Section 1491(b)(1) of Title 28 of the United States Code\n\nspecifically provides that challenges to solicitations may be brought “without regard to\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                     5\n\fwhether suit is instituted before or after the contract is awarded.” To be sure, 10 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2304c(e)(1) provides that “[a] protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance\n\nof a task order or delivery order except for -- (A) a protest on the ground that the order\n\nincreases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is\n\nissued; or (B) a protest of an order valued in excess of $10,000,000.”            (emphasis\n\nadded); see also FAR ¶ 16.505(a)(9). But the statute does not limit protests of an\n\noverall solicitation or IDIQ contract; it only limits challenges to the task order or delivery\n\norder. Weeks Marine or another contractor thus could challenge the Corps’ overall\n\nsolicitation after, rather than only before, the IDIQ or task order awards. 2\n\n       Second, standing is not created by the absence of parties with proper standing.\n\n“The assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have\n\nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the\n\nWar, 418 U.S. at 227. “This view would convert standing into a requirement that must\n\nbe observed only when satisfied.”       Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"210550\"><a href=\"/opinion/210550/blue-gold-fleet-lp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir.\n2007), is not to the contrary. In Blue & Gold Fleet the bidder waited until after the\ncontract award to challenge a solicitation. We held that “a party who has the\nopportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error\nand fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the\nsame objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.” Id.\nat 1313. Our opinion in Blue & Gold Fleet does not suggest that a contractor can\nchallenge a procurement system before actually suffering or being likely to suffer an\ninjury. Blue & Gold Fleet holds only that if the contractor is injured and has the\n“opportunity to object” to the solicitation, it cannot defer its challenge to a period after\nwhich the contract is awarded.\n\n\n2008-5034                                     6\n\frequirements for standing does not create standing in a party who has not suffered\n\ninjury.\n\n                                II Lack of Statutory Standing\n\n          As the majority recognizes, the applicable statute imposes even more stringent\n\nstanding requirements. See Maj. Op. 10-11. Under the statute, the Court of Federal\n\nClaims has jurisdiction\n\n          to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a\n          solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed\n          contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged\n          violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a\n          proposed procurement . . . without regard to whether suit is instituted\n          before or after the contract is awarded.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (emphases added). In American Federation of Government\n\nEmployees v. United States, we reviewed at length the history of § 1491(b)(1) and\n\nconcluded that Congress did not intend to confer standing under the more liberal\n\nstanding rules of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702, but instead limited\n\nstanding under § 1491(b)(1) to “disappointed bidders” and to prospective bidders whose\n\nchances of securing the award would be adversely affected. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774254\"><a href=\"/opinion/774254/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-american-federation/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1302 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2001). We stated that we “construe the term ‘interested party’ in § 1491(b)(1) in\n\naccordance with the [Competition in Contracting Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3551-56], and hold\n\nthat standing under § 1491(b)(1) is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors\n\nwhose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by\n\nfailure to award the contract.” Id. at 1302 (emphasis added).\n\n          In the case of pre-award protests, we have repeatedly limited standing under\n\n§ 1491 to those bidders who have a “substantial chance” of securing the award and who\n\nhave been disadvantaged by the government procurement decision they challenge. In\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    7\n\fRex Service Corp. v. United States, we held that a contractor did not have standing\n\nbecause it did not “establish that it had a ‘substantial chance’ of receiving the contract”\n\nand thus “prove a direct economic interest as a putative prospective bidder.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"211274\"><a href=\"/opinion/211274/rex-service-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1308 (Fed.

Cir. 1996) (holding that a contractor failed to show a “substantial chance it\n\nwould have received the contract award but for” agency error). In CACI Field Services,\n\nInc. v. United States, we held that a contractor could not prevail in a pre-award bid\n\nprotest without showing prejudice from an alleged violation of a procurement statute or\n\nregulation, because “prejudice is a separate element which must be proven.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510204\"><a href=\"/opinion/510204/caci-field-services-inc-v-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466 (Fed.

Cir. 2002) (“[P]rejudice (or injury) is a necessary\n\nelement of standing.”).\n\n       Weeks Marine here is not a “disappointed bidder,” nor has it shown that its direct\n\neconomic interests have been adversely affected. Indeed, for all the record reveals,\n\nWeeks Marine will continue to receive exactly the same contracts that it would have\n\nreceived under the earlier sealed bidding procedure.         Allowing Weeks Marine to\n\nestablish standing without a showing of concrete injury vastly and improperly expands\n\nthe number of parties potentially qualifying for standing.\n\n       Under these circumstances, it seems to me clear that Weeks Marine does not\n\nhave Article III or statutory standing, and I respectfully dissent from the majority’s\n\ncontrary conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n2008-5034                                    8\n\f</pre>",
