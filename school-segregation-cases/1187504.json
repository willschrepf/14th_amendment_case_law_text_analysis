Bromberg, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan,\nLLP, Redwood Shores, California, for the plaintiff-appellant.\n\f                      WATISON v. CARTER                    1729\nClark G. Leslie, Department of the Attorney General, Carson\nCity, Nevada, for the defendants-appellees.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nFARRIS, Senior Circuit Judge:\n\n   Petitioner Raymond Watison, who is serving a sentence in\nNevada State Prison, sued defendant prison officials under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 pro se, alleging that they violated several of his\nrights under the U.S. Constitution. He also alleged that the\nofficials violated various Nevada laws. The district court dis-\nmissed Watison’s complaint with prejudice. Watison appealed\nthe dismissal of some of his claims and had counsel appointed\nfor him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n   Watison failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim against\nCorrectional Officer Sean LaGier and failed to state a First\nAmendment retaliation claim against Correctional Officer\nJoseph Rodriguez, but Watison’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaims against Associate Warden Mary Carter and Correc-\ntional Officers Rosa Rodriguez, Sean LaGier, and Danilo San-\ntos require further consideration. The district court should not\nhave dismissed Watison’s state-law claims with prejudice. We\ntherefore affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I.\n\n   [1] We review the dismissal of a complaint for failure to\nstate a claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo.\nBarren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998).\nThe standard for determining whether a plaintiff has failed to\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted under\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is the same as the Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6) standard for failure to state a claim. See,\ne.g., Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122 (2000). Dismissal is\n\f1730                    WATISON v. CARTER\nproper only if it is clear that the plaintiff cannot prove any set\nof facts in support of the claim that would entitle him to relief.\nMorley v. Walker, 175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir. 1999). In mak-\ning this determination, we take as true all allegations of mate-\nrial fact stated in the complaint and construe them in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiff. Warshaw v. Xoma Corp., 74\nF.3d 955, 957 (9th Cir. 1996). We “construe [a pro se plain-\ntiff’s] pleadings liberally and . . . afford the petitioner the ben-\nefit of any doubt.” Hebbe v. Pliler, 627 F.3d 338, 342 (9th\nCir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                II.\n\n   Watison alleged that Correctional Officer Sean LaGier sex-\nually harassed him in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He\nalleged that LaGier entered his (Watison’s) cell while Wati-\nson was on the toilet and began to search it, that Watison\nasked LaGier to leave the room, and that LaGier approached\nWatison while Watison was still on the toilet, rubbed his thigh\nagainst Watison’s thigh, “began smiling in a sexual contact\n[sic],” and left the cell laughing.\n\n   [2] “After incarceration, only the unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\nforbidden by the Eighth Amendment.” Jordan v. Gardner,\n986 F.2d 1521, 1525 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (quoting Whit-\nley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319, 106 S. Ct. 1078, 1084, 89\nL. Ed. 2d 251 (1986)) (internal quotation marks and indica-\ntions of alteration omitted). The alleged pain may be physical\nor psychological. See, e.g., Jordan, 986 F.2d 1521. Neverthe-\nless, the “inmate must objectively show that he was deprived\nof something ‘sufficiently serious.’ ” Foster v. Runnels, 554\nF.3d 807, 812 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan,\n511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1977, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811\n(1994)). For example, in Jordan, we held that the Eighth\nAmendment prohibited clothed body searches of female pris-\noners by male guards directed by a prison policy to “push\ninward and upward when searching the crotch and upper\n\f                      WATISON v. CARTER                    1731\nthighs of the inmate,” to “squeeze and knead” “the leg and the\ncrotch area,” and to “search the breast area in a sweeping\nmotion, so that the breasts will be ‘flattened.’ ” 986 F.2d at\n1523 (indications of alteration omitted). The Jordan court’s\nfinding of serious deprivation relied on the “high probability\nof . . . severe psychological injury and emotional pain and suf-\nfering . . . from these searches” based on the inmates’ “shock-\ning histories of verbal, physical, and, in particular, sexual\nabuse . . . .” Id. at 1525. By contrast, “the exchange of verbal\ninsults between inmates and guards is a constant, daily ritual\nobserved in this nation’s prisons” of which “we do not\napprove,” but which do not violate the Eighth Amendment.\nSomers v. Thurman, 109 F.3d 614, 622 (9th Cir. 1997) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, not “every malevo-\nlent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of\naction.” Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S. Ct. 995,\n1000, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992).\n\n   [3] The “humiliation” Watison allegedly suffered from the\nincident with Officer LaGier does not rise to the level of\nsevere psychological pain required to state an Eighth Amend-\nment claim. We have found no Eighth Amendment violation\nin situations involving more serious deprivations than the\ndeprivation Watison allegedly suffered. For example, in\nSomers, we held that the Eighth Amendment did not prohibit\nfemale guards from performing visual body cavity searches\non male inmates or watching male inmates shower, despite\none inmate’s allegation that the guards pointed, joked, and\n“gawked” at him. Somers, 109 F.3d at 616; see also, e.g.,\nGrummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 494 n.1 (9th Cir. 1985)\n(prison’s policy allowing female guards to observe male\ninmates disrobing, showering, using the toilet, and being\nstrip-searched, and allowing them to conduct pat-down\nsearches including the groin area, did not amount to “the type\nof shocking and barbarous treatment protected against by the\n[E]ighth [A]mendment”).\n\n  [4] We emphasize, as we did in Somers, that this case does\nnot present the Eighth Amendment concerns found in Jordan.\n\f1732                      WATISON v. CARTER\nSee Somers, 109 F.3d at 623. Jordan’s holding relied on (1)\nthe preexisting mental conditions of the female inmates,\nwhich caused them “to react differently to [the] searches . . .\nthan would male inmates subjected to similar searches by\nwomen,” Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1525, and (2) the intrusive\nnature of the searches. Somers, 109 F.3d at 624. As in Somers,\nneither of these factors is present here. Watison is a male\ninmate, and the only physical contact he alleged was a brief\nbrush of LaGier’s leg against his own.\n\n   The Eighth Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Berry-\nhill v. Schriro, 137 F.3d 1073 (8th Cir. 1998). In Berryhill, the\nplaintiff alleged that prison maintenance employees “embar-\nrass[ed] him” in violation of the Eighth Amendment when\none of them “grabbed him by the shoulders while [another]\ngrabbed his buttocks with one hand briefly” and a third\n“grabbed Berryhill’s buttocks for a moment.” Id. at 1074-75\n(indications of alteration omitted). The Eighth Circuit found\nno Eighth Amendment violation because “there is no evidence\nthat Berryhill suffered anything more than a brief unwanted\ntouch on his buttocks” and “[i]t would be a distortion . . . to\ncharacterize the conduct in this case as a sexual assault.” Id.\nat 1076. Like Watison’s, Berryhill’s “humiliat[ion]” did not\nconstitute “objectively serious injury (either physical or psy-\nchological).” Id.1\n  1\n    This Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is consistent with Supreme\nCourt precedent on sexual harassment. The Supreme Court has held that\n“simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless\nextremely serious) will not amount to [a] discriminatory [hostile environ-\nment] . . . .” Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.\nCt. 2275, 2283, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted) (emphasis added); see also Clark County Sch. Dist. v.\nBreeden, 532 U.S. 268, 271, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 1510, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509\n(2001) (holding that comments and chuckling by co-workers were “at\nworst an ‘isolated inciden[t]’ that cannot remotely be considered\n‘extremely serious,’ as our cases require”) (citing Faragher, 524 U.S. at\n788, 118 S. Ct. at 2283) (alteration in original).\n\f                       WATISON v. CARTER                     1733\n   Watison argues that the alleged incident “plainly violates\ncontemporary standards of decency” because “unwanted sex-\nual contact by prison officials is now forbidden by every\nstate.” LaGier’s alleged conduct, however, is not the type of\nconduct these laws forbid. See, e.g., Ala. Code §§ 14-11-31,\n14-11-30(3) (forbidden “sexual conduct” defined to include\nsexual intercourse and “touching[,] for the purpose of sexual\narousal, gratification, or abuse[,] of . . . sexual or other inti-\nmate parts”); Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 163.454, 163.305(6) (forbid-\nden “sexual contact” defined as “touching of the sexual or\nother intimate parts of a person . . . for the purpose of arous-\ning or gratifying the sexual desire of either party”); Vt. Stat.\nAnn. tit. 13, §§ 3257, 3251(1) (definition of forbidden con-\nduct does not include touching thigh to thigh); Wis. Stat.\n§§ 940.225(2)(h), (5)(b), 5(c) (same). Therefore, Watison’s\ncitations do not aid his argument.\n\n   [5] Because Officer LaGier’s “alleged wrongdoing was\n[not] objectively ‘harmful enough’ to establish a constitu-\ntional violation,” the district court properly dismissed Wati-\nson’s Eighth Amendment claim against LaGier. Hudson, 503\nU.S. at 8, 112 S. Ct. at 999 (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S.\n294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 2324, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991)).\n\n                               III.\n\n   [6] Prisoners have a First Amendment right to file griev-\nances against prison officials and to be free from retaliation\nfor doing so. Brodheim v. Cry, 584 F.3d 1262, 1269 (9th Cir.\n2009). A retaliation claim has five elements. Id. First, the\nplaintiff must allege that the retaliated-against conduct is pro-\ntected. The filing of an inmate grievance is protected conduct.\nRhodes v. Robinson, 408 F.3d 559, 568 (9th Cir. 2005). Sec-\nond, the plaintiff must claim the defendant took adverse\naction against the plaintiff. Id. at 567. The adverse action need\nnot be an independent constitutional violation. Pratt v. Row-\nland, 65 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir. 1995). “[T]he mere threat of\n\f1734                      WATISON v. CARTER\nharm can be an adverse action . . . .” Brodheim, 584 F.3d at\n1270.\n\n   Third, the plaintiff must allege a causal connection between\nthe adverse action and the protected conduct. Because direct\nevidence of retaliatory intent rarely can be pleaded in a com-\nplaint, allegation of a chronology of events from which retali-\nation can be inferred is sufficient to survive dismissal. See\nPratt, 65 F.3d at 808 (“timing can properly be considered as\ncircumstantial evidence of retaliatory intent”); Murphy v.\nLane, 833 F.2d 106, 108-09 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n   Fourth, the plaintiff must allege that the “official’s acts\nwould chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from\nfuture First Amendment activities.” Robinson, 408 F.3d at\n568 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). “[A]\nplaintiff who fails to allege a chilling effect may still state a\nclaim if he alleges he suffered some other harm,” Brodheim,\n584 F.3d at 1269, that is “more than minimal,” Robinson, 408\nF.3d at 568 n.11. That the retaliatory conduct did not chill the\nplaintiff from suing the alleged retaliator does not defeat the\nretaliation claim at the motion to dismiss stage. Id. at 569.\n\n   Fifth, the plaintiff must allege “that the prison authorities’\nretaliatory action did not advance legitimate goals of the cor-\nrectional institution . . . .” Rizzo v. Dawson, 778 F.2d 527, 532\n(9th Cir. 1985). A plaintiff successfully pleads this element by\nalleging, in addition to a retaliatory motive, that the defen-\ndant’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, id., or that they\nwere “unnecessary to the maintenance of order in the institu-\ntion,” Franklin v. Murphy, 745 F.2d 1221, 1230 (9th Cir.\n1984).\n\nA.     Claims Against Associate Warden Carter and Officer\n       Rosa Rodriguez2\n  2\n    We treat the allegations as true solely for the purpose of reviewing the\nsufficiency of the allegations. Dougherty v. City of Covina, 654 F.3d 892,\n896 n.2 (9th Cir. 2011). Their recitation should not be taken to express our\nbelief in their accuracy.\n\f                       WATISON v. CARTER                     1735\n   Watison claimed that Associate Warden Mary Carter and\nCorrectional Officer Rosa Rodriguez retaliated against him\nfor filing grievances against Rodriguez. Watison claimed that\non May 20, 2009, Rodriguez, “[i]n retaliation” for a grievance\nWatison had previously filed against her for racial discrimina-\ntion, falsely “wrote [Watison] up” for calling her an expletive.\nOn May 27, Watison filed another grievance against Rodri-\nguez. “[D]ue to [these] allegations [Watison] had against\ndefendant Mrs. Rodriguez,” Rodriguez and Carter had Wati-\nson placed in administrative segregation that same day. At\nWatison’s May 29 parole hearing, Carter, in “retaliati[on]\n[for] numerous amounts of complaints/grievances [Watison\nfiled] against her . . . and another prison official [Rodriguez],”\nfalsely stated that Watison had been placed in administrative\nsegregation because he had used abusive language toward\nstaff. “[D]ue to [Carter’s] lies,” the parole board found that\nWatison had engaged in “disruptive institutional behavior”\nand denied Watison parole.\n\n   [7] Watison alleged facts sufficient to state a First Amend-\nment retaliation claim. Watison alleged (1) that he engaged in\nprotected actions: he filed grievances against Rodriguez. He\nalleged (2) that Rodriguez and Carter took adverse actions\nagainst him: Rodriguez filed a false disciplinary charge\nagainst him; he was placed in administrative segregation; and\nCarter’s lies to the parole board resulted in denial of parole.\nWatison also alleged (3) a connection between (1) and (2):\nRodriguez and Carter took these adverse actions shortly after,\nand “[i]n retaliation” for, Watison’s filing of grievances\nagainst Rodriguez. He alleged (4) that the retaliatory actions\nwould have chilled or silenced a person of ordinary firmness\nby alleging “more than minimal” harms—the filing of a false\ndisciplinary charge against Watison, his placement in admin-\nistrative segregation, and interference with his parole hearing.\nFinally, Watison alleged (5) the absence of a legitimate peno-\nlogical reason for the alleged adverse actions: Watison\npleaded arbitrary, capricious, and retaliatory conduct in plead-\ning that (a) Rodriguez filed a false disciplinary complaint\n\f1736                  WATISON v. CARTER\nagainst him and (b) Carter made false statements to the parole\nboard, both in retaliation for grievances Watison had filed\nagainst Rodriguez. Watison sufficiently pleaded First Amend-\nment retaliation claims against Carter and Rodriguez. The dis-\ntrict court improperly dismissed these claims.\n\nB.     Claim Against Officer Santos\n\n   Watison claimed that Correctional Officer Danilo Santos\nretaliated against him for filing grievances against Santos. He\nclaimed that on July 7, 2009, Santos “became very angry\nwith” Watison, “walked directly in [Watison’s] face and\nstated ‘your emergency grievance isn’t going to stand,’ ” and\nthreatened to hit Watison in the mouth for a complaint Wati-\nson was in the process of filing against Santos.\n\n   [8] The district court also improperly dismissed this claim.\nWatison alleged (1) that he engaged in a protected action: he\nfiled a grievance against Santos. He alleged (2) that Santos\ntook adverse action against him: Santos threatened to hit him\nin the mouth. Watison also alleged (3) a connection between\n(1) and (2): Santos threatened to hit Watison “for” a grievance\nWatison filed against Santos. Watison alleged (4) chilling\nconduct—the threat of physical violence. Finally, the facts\nWatison alleged implicitly pleaded the fifth element: threaten-\ning to punch a prisoner serves no penological interest. Wati-\nson’s First Amendment claim against Santos should not have\nbeen dismissed.\n\nC.     Claim Against Officer LaGier\n\n   Watison claimed that Officer LaGier retaliated against him\nfor filing grievances against LaGier. Watison claimed that on\nAug 11, 2009, LaGier refused to give Watison his breakfast,\nstared in Watison’s room smiling at him, and said, “ ‘They’re\nnot going to do nothing with those grievances you filed\nagainst me.’ ” Watison then asked LaGier for an “informal\ngrievance.” LaGier responded with an expletive and refer-\n\f                         WATISON v. CARTER                        1737\nenced a grievance Watison had previously filed against\nLaGier. Watison alleged that “the meal refusals were [in]\nretaliation” for Watison’s “filing a grievance against\n[LaGier].”\n\n   [9] The district court should not have dismissed Watison’s\nFirst Amendment claim against LaGier. Watison alleged\n(1) that he engaged in protected actions: he filed grievances\nagainst LaGier. He alleged (2) that LaGier took adverse\nactions against him: LaGier refused to give him breakfast.\nWatison also alleged (3) a connection between (1) and (2):\nduring the same interaction in which LaGier refused to give\nWatison breakfast, LaGier mentioned the grievances. He\nalleged (4) chilling conduct by alleging “more than minimal”\nharm—deprival of food. Finally, Watison alleged the fifth ele-\nment: Watison alleged that LaGier’s conduct was retaliatory;\nand Watison’s allegation that he asked to file a grievance\nabout LaGier’s denying him breakfast sufficiently raised a\nquestion regarding the basis for the meal refusal.\n\nD.     Claim Against Officer Joseph Rodriguez\n\n     In his complaint, Watison alleged the following:\n\n       On July 5, 2009 . . . Rodriguez became very angry\n       in his voice of tone . . . [and] aimed [a] gun at me\n       and cocked it back. . . . Defendant had no reason,\n       justification to aim a gun at me . . . . I’ve filed com-\n       plaints against defendant and defendant is retaliating\n       against me.\n\n       .....\n\n       Count IV Eighth Amendment[:] . . . On date of 07/\n       05/09 . . . Mr. Rodriguez begain [sic] yelling and\n       screaming[.] I (inmate) acknowledged him aim a 12\n       gauge directly at me. Cock it back and repeat[ed]ly\n       yelling and screaming. I (inmate) then stated “What\n\f1738                  WATISON v. CARTER\n    you want?” C/O Mr. Rodriguez then with draw the\n    gun back. I filed an emergency grievance and\n    exhausted the grievance process and been denied.\n    And I’m now being harassed by the same officer.\n\n   [10] Because Watison labeled this claim as an Eighth\nAmendment claim, the district court addressed it as such and\ndismissed it. Watison argues that the district court should\nhave treated the claim as a First Amendment retaliation claim,\ncharacterizing Rodriguez’s gun-pointing as retaliation for\ngrievances Watison filed against him. In fact, the complaint\nalleged that Watison filed a grievance in response to the gun-\npointing incident, and that he is “now being harassed” in retal-\niation for that grievance. If there is any retaliation claim\nagainst Rodriguez to be found in Watison’s complaint, then,\nit is that Rodriguez is now “harass[ing]” Watison in retalia-\ntion for the emergency grievance Watison filed against Rodri-\nguez. This harassment-retaliation claim fails. Watison alleged\nno facts about Rodriguez’s alleged harassing behavior, and he\nfailed to allege that the harassment constitutes chilling con-\nduct, is connected to Watison’s filing of the emergency griev-\nance, and lacks a penological justification. The district court\nproperly dismissed this claim.\n\n   [11] However, on remand, the district court should grant\nWatison leave to amend this claim to correct its deficiencies.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a trial\ncourt shall grant leave to amend freely “when justice so\nrequires.” “[A] district court should grant leave to amend even\nif no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it deter-\nmines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the\nallegation of other facts.” Doe v. United States, 58 F.3d 494,\n497 (9th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n“rule favoring liberality in amendments to pleadings is partic-\nularly important for the pro se litigant.” Lopez, 203 F.3d at\n1131 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Watison might\ncure his pleadings by alleging more facts—namely, the what,\nwhen, and where of Rodriguez’s alleged harassing behavior;\n\f                      WATISON v. CARTER                    1739\nthe harassment’s chilling effect; its connection to the griev-\nance Watison filed against Rodriguez; and the absence of a\npenological justification for Rodriguez’s behavior.\n\n                              IV.\n\n   In addition to federal constitutional claims, Watison alleged\neleven claims under Nevada Revised Statutes §§ 197.200\n(oppression under color of office), 197.210 (fraudulent appro-\npriation of property), 197.220 (other violations by officers),\nand 212.020 (inhumanity to prisoners)—all criminal statutes.\nThe district court dismissed these claims with prejudice, with-\nout explanation. We suspect the district court declined to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims\nonce it had dismissed the federal claims. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(c)(3). If so, the court should have dismissed the state-\nlaw claims without prejudice. See Les Shockley Racing, Inc.\nv. Nat’l Hot Rod Ass’n, 884 F.2d 504, 509 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\n   [12] On remand, the district court will have original juris-\ndiction over Watison’s First Amendment claims and shall\ndecide anew whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\nover the state-law claims. See, e.g., Fang v. United States, 140\nF.3d 1238, 1244 (9th Cir. 1998). The district court may, in its\ndiscretion, decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the\nbasis that a state court should decide in the first instance the\n“novel or complex issue of State law” of whether the criminal\nstatutes on which Watison’s state-law claims are based give\nrise to civil liability—and if not, whether Watison’s allega-\ntions nevertheless sufficiently plead state common-law\nclaims, such as tort claims, against the defendants. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(c)(1); see, e.g., Robinson v. Baca, No. 3:08-cv-00389-\nHDM-VPC, slip op. at 5, 2010 WL 3724189 (D. Nev. Aug.\n25, 2010) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\nover plaintiff’s state-law claims in part because “the question\nof whether the cited criminal statutes convey a private right\nof action should be determined by a state court”); see gener-\nally Collins v. Palczewski, 841 F. Supp. 333, 340 (D. Nev.\n\f1740                      WATISON v. CARTER\n1993) (“[C]riminal statutes cannot be enforced by civil\nactions [unless] . . . the plaintiffs [are] members of the public\nthat the statutes were specifically designed to protect.”) (inter-\nnal quotation marks and citations omitted) (citing Cort v. Ash,\n422 U.S. 66, 78-82, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 2088-90, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26\n(1975); United States v. Claflin, 97 U.S. 546, 24 L. Ed. 1082\n(1878); United States v. Jourden, 193 F. 986 (9th Cir. 1912)).3\nThe inquiry into whether the complaint states common-law\nclaims is necessary because a “complaint should not be dis-\nmissed merely because plaintiff’s allegations do not support\nthe legal theory he intends to proceed on, since the court is\nunder a duty to examine the complaint to determine if the\nallegations provide for relief on any possible theory.” Pruitt\nv. Cheney, 963 F.2d 1160, 1164 (9th Cir. 1991). Alternatively,\nthe district court may decide that it should retain supplemental\njurisdiction over the state-law claims. Even claims with slight\nmonetary value survive a motion to dismiss, unless we can\nsay with certainty that no factual basis has been alleged.\n\n                                    V.\n\n   [13] We affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Watison’s\nEighth Amendment claim against Officer LaGier.

Aug. 11, 2011).\n\f                       WATISON v. CARTER                    1741\nreverse the dismissal with prejudice of Watison’s state-law\nclaims and remand with instructions to decide whether to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.\n\n  Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n  AFFIRMED        in   part,   REVERSED        in   part,   and\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\nNOONAN, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:\n\n   I concur except as to the holding that dismisses Watison’s\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment. The incident central to\nthis claim is, for good reason, one that has not been the sub-\nject of appellate litigation: the grossness of the conduct\nalleged is not likely to have often occurred. In a word, a pris-\noner sitting in his own cell on his toilet was allegedly rubbed\non his thigh by a prison guard who had entered the cell. The\nsexual implications of this stroking plus the interference with\nthe prisoner’s discharge of his bladder amounted to the inflic-\ntion of psychological pain. Given the privacy allegedly\ninvaded, this kind of pain was sufficiently serious to consti-\ntute constitutionally prohibited cruelty.\n\n   We do not have, and need not have, a precedent exactly\ngoverning the case. A century ago the Supreme Court set out\nthe governing principle:\n\n    Time works changes, brings into existence new con-\n    ditions and purposes. Therefore a principle to be\n    vital must be capable of wider application than the\n    mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true\n    of constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments,\n    designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use\n    the words of Chief Justice Marshall, ‘designed to\n    approach immortality as nearly as human institutions\n\f1742                  WATISON v. CARTER\n    can approach it.’ The future is their care and provi-\n    sion for events of good and bad tendencies of which\n    no prophecy can be made. In the application of a\n    constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be\n    only of what has been but of what may be. Under\n    any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy\n    of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and\n    power. Its general principles would have little value\n    and be converted by precedent into impotent and\n    lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be\n    lost in reality. And this has been recognized. The\n    meaning and vitality of the Constitution have devel-\n    oped against narrow and restrictive construction.\n\nWeems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373 (1910).\n\n  The prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment covers the\ncase presented by Watison.\n\f",

He also alleged that the\nofficials violated various Nevada laws. The district court dis-\nmissed Watison’s complaint with prejudice. Watison appealed\nthe dismissal of some of his claims and had counsel appointed\nfor him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n   Watison failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim against\nCorrectional Officer Sean LaGier and failed to state a First\nAmendment retaliation claim against Correctional Officer\nJoseph Rodriguez, but Watison’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaims against Associate Warden Mary Carter and Correc-\ntional Officers Rosa Rodriguez, Sean LaGier, and Danilo San-\ntos require further consideration. The district court should not\nhave dismissed Watison’s state-law claims with prejudice. We\ntherefore affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I.\n\n   [1] We review the dismissal of a complaint for failure to\nstate a claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo.\nBarren v.

The Jordan court’s\nfinding of serious deprivation relied on the “high probability\nof . . . severe psychological injury and emotional pain and suf-\nfering . . . from these searches” based on the inmates’ “shock-\ning histories of verbal, physical, and, in particular, sexual\nabuse . . . .” Id. at 1525. By contrast, “the exchange of verbal\ninsults between inmates and guards is a constant, daily ritual\nobserved in this nation’s prisons” of which “we do not\napprove,” but which do not violate the Eighth Amendment.\nSomers v.

We have found no Eighth Amendment violation\nin situations involving more serious deprivations than the\ndeprivation Watison allegedly suffered. For example, in\nSomers, we held that the Eighth Amendment did not prohibit\nfemale guards from performing visual body cavity searches\non male inmates or watching male inmates shower, despite\none inmate’s allegation that the guards pointed, joked, and\n“gawked” at him.

CARTER\nSee Somers, 109 F.3d at 623. Jordan’s holding relied on (1)\nthe preexisting mental conditions of the female inmates,\nwhich caused them “to react differently to [the] searches . . .\nthan would male inmates subjected to similar searches by\nwomen,” Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1525, and (2) the intrusive\nnature of the searches. Somers, 109 F.3d at 624. As in Somers,\nneither of these factors is present here. Watison is a male\ninmate, and the only physical contact he alleged was a brief\nbrush of LaGier’s leg against his own.\n\n   The Eighth Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Berry-\nhill v. Schriro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751888\"><a href=\"/opinion/751888/cortez-berryhill-v-dora-schriro-george-lombardi-kelly-lock-larry/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1998). In Berryhill, the\nplaintiff alleged that prison maintenance employees “embar-\nrass[ed] him” in violation of the Eighth Amendment when\none of them “grabbed him by the shoulders while [another]\ngrabbed his buttocks with one hand briefly” and a third\n“grabbed Berryhill’s buttocks for a moment.” Id. at 1074-75\n(indications of alteration omitted). The Eighth Circuit found\nno Eighth Amendment violation because “there is no evidence\nthat Berryhill suffered anything more than a brief unwanted\ntouch on his buttocks” and “[i]t would be a distortion . . . to\ncharacterize the conduct in this case as a sexual assault.” Id.\nat 1076. Like Watison’s, Berryhill’s “humiliat[ion]” did not\nconstitute “objectively serious injury (either physical or psy-\nchological).” Id.1\n  1\n    This Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is consistent with Supreme\nCourt precedent on sexual harassment.

CARTER                     1733\n   Watison argues that the alleged incident “plainly violates\ncontemporary standards of decency” because “unwanted sex-\nual contact by prison officials is now forbidden by every\nstate.” LaGier’s alleged conduct, however, is not the type of\nconduct these laws forbid. See, e.g., Ala. Code §§ 14-11-31,\n14-11-30(3) (forbidden “sexual conduct” defined to include\nsexual intercourse and “touching[,] for the purpose of sexual\narousal, gratification, or abuse[,] of . . . sexual or other inti-\nmate parts”); Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 163.454, 163.305(6) (forbid-\nden “sexual contact” defined as “touching of the sexual or\nother intimate parts of a person . . . for the purpose of arous-\ning or gratifying the sexual desire of either party”); Vt. Stat.\nAnn. tit. 13, §§ 3257, 3251(1) (definition of forbidden con-\nduct does not include touching thigh to thigh); Wis. Stat.\n§§ 940.225(2)(h), (5)(b), 5(c) (same). Therefore, Watison’s\ncitations do not aid his argument.\n\n   [5] Because Officer LaGier’s “alleged wrongdoing was\n[not] objectively ‘harmful enough’ to establish a constitu-\ntional violation,” the district court properly dismissed Wati-\nson’s Eighth Amendment claim against LaGier.

A retaliation claim has five elements. Id. First, the\nplaintiff must allege that the retaliated-against conduct is pro-\ntected. The filing of an inmate grievance is protected conduct.\nRhodes v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790304\"><a href=\"/opinion/790304/kavin-maurice-rhodes-v-m-robinson-r-r-officer-ron-blevins-r-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (9th Cir. 2005).

Because direct\nevidence of retaliatory intent rarely can be pleaded in a com-\nplaint, allegation of a chronology of events from which retali-\nation can be inferred is sufficient to survive dismissal. See\nPratt, 65 F.3d at 808 (“timing can properly be considered as\ncircumstantial evidence of retaliatory intent”); Murphy v.\nLane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497035\"><a href=\"/opinion/497035/paul-murphy-v-michael-p-lane-director-of-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108-09 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n   Fourth, the plaintiff must allege that the “official’s acts\nwould chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from\nfuture First Amendment activities.” Robinson, 408 F.3d at\n568 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). “[A]\nplaintiff who fails to allege a chilling effect may still state a\nclaim if he alleges he suffered some other harm,” Brodheim,\n584 F.3d at 1269, that is “more than minimal,” Robinson, 408\nF.3d at 568 n.11. That the retaliatory conduct did not chill the\nplaintiff from suing the alleged retaliator does not defeat the\nretaliation claim at the motion to dismiss stage. Id. at 569.\n\n   Fifth, the plaintiff must allege “that the prison authorities’\nretaliatory action did not advance legitimate goals of the cor-\nrectional institution . . . .” Rizzo v.

Their recitation should not be taken to express our\nbelief in their accuracy.\n\f                       WATISON v. CARTER                     1735\n   Watison claimed that Associate Warden Mary Carter and\nCorrectional Officer Rosa Rodriguez retaliated against him\nfor filing grievances against Rodriguez. Watison claimed that\non May 20, 2009, Rodriguez, “[i]n retaliation” for a grievance\nWatison had previously filed against her for racial discrimina-\ntion, falsely “wrote [Watison] up” for calling her an expletive.\nOn May 27, Watison filed another grievance against Rodri-\nguez. “[D]ue to [these] allegations [Watison] had against\ndefendant Mrs. Rodriguez,” Rodriguez and Carter had Wati-\nson placed in administrative segregation that same day. At\nWatison’s May 29 parole hearing, Carter, in “retaliati[on]\n[for] numerous amounts of complaints/grievances [Watison\nfiled] against her . . . and another prison official [Rodriguez],”\nfalsely stated that Watison had been placed in administrative\nsegregation because he had used abusive language toward\nstaff. “[D]ue to [Carter’s] lies,” the parole board found that\nWatison had engaged in “disruptive institutional behavior”\nand denied Watison parole.\n\n   [7] Watison alleged facts sufficient to state a First Amend-\nment retaliation claim. Watison alleged (1) that he engaged in\nprotected actions: he filed grievances against Rodriguez. He\nalleged (2) that Rodriguez and Carter took adverse actions\nagainst him: Rodriguez filed a false disciplinary charge\nagainst him; he was placed in administrative segregation; and\nCarter’s lies to the parole board resulted in denial of parole.\nWatison also alleged (3) a connection between (1) and (2):\nRodriguez and Carter took these adverse actions shortly after,\nand “[i]n retaliation” for, Watison’s filing of grievances\nagainst Rodriguez. He alleged (4) that the retaliatory actions\nwould have chilled or silenced a person of ordinary firmness\nby alleging “more than minimal” harms—the filing of a false\ndisciplinary charge against Watison, his placement in admin-\nistrative segregation, and interference with his parole hearing.\nFinally, Watison alleged (5) the absence of a legitimate peno-\nlogical reason for the alleged adverse actions: Watison\npleaded arbitrary, capricious, and retaliatory conduct in plead-\ning that (a) Rodriguez filed a false disciplinary complaint\n\f1736                  WATISON v. CARTER\nagainst him and (b) Carter made false statements to the parole\nboard, both in retaliation for grievances Watison had filed\nagainst Rodriguez. Watison sufficiently pleaded First Amend-\nment retaliation claims against Carter and Rodriguez. The dis-\ntrict court improperly dismissed these claims.\n\nB.     Claim Against Officer Santos\n\n   Watison claimed that Correctional Officer Danilo Santos\nretaliated against him for filing grievances against Santos. He\nclaimed that on July 7, 2009, Santos “became very angry\nwith” Watison, “walked directly in [Watison’s] face and\nstated ‘your emergency grievance isn’t going to stand,’ ” and\nthreatened to hit Watison in the mouth for a complaint Wati-\nson was in the process of filing against Santos.\n\n   [8] The district court also improperly dismissed this claim.\nWatison alleged (1) that he engaged in a protected action: he\nfiled a grievance against Santos. He alleged (2) that Santos\ntook adverse action against him: Santos threatened to hit him\nin the mouth. Watison also alleged (3) a connection between\n(1) and (2): Santos threatened to hit Watison “for” a grievance\nWatison filed against Santos. Watison alleged (4) chilling\nconduct—the threat of physical violence. Finally, the facts\nWatison alleged implicitly pleaded the fifth element: threaten-\ning to punch a prisoner serves no penological interest. Wati-\nson’s First Amendment claim against Santos should not have\nbeen dismissed.\n\nC.     Claim Against Officer LaGier\n\n   Watison claimed that Officer LaGier retaliated against him\nfor filing grievances against LaGier. Watison claimed that on\nAug 11, 2009, LaGier refused to give Watison his breakfast,\nstared in Watison’s room smiling at him, and said, “ ‘They’re\nnot going to do nothing with those grievances you filed\nagainst me.’ ” Watison then asked LaGier for an “informal\ngrievance.” LaGier responded with an expletive and refer-\n\f                         WATISON v. CARTER                        1737\nenced a grievance Watison had previously filed against\nLaGier. Watison alleged that “the meal refusals were [in]\nretaliation” for Watison’s “filing a grievance against\n[LaGier].”\n\n   [9] The district court should not have dismissed Watison’s\nFirst Amendment claim against LaGier. Watison alleged\n(1) that he engaged in protected actions: he filed grievances\nagainst LaGier. He alleged (2) that LaGier took adverse\nactions against him: LaGier refused to give him breakfast.\nWatison also alleged (3) a connection between (1) and (2):\nduring the same interaction in which LaGier refused to give\nWatison breakfast, LaGier mentioned the grievances. He\nalleged (4) chilling conduct by alleging “more than minimal”\nharm—deprival of food. Finally, Watison alleged the fifth ele-\nment: Watison alleged that LaGier’s conduct was retaliatory;\nand Watison’s allegation that he asked to file a grievance\nabout LaGier’s denying him breakfast sufficiently raised a\nquestion regarding the basis for the meal refusal.\n\nD.     Claim Against Officer Joseph Rodriguez\n\n     In his complaint, Watison alleged the following:\n\n       On July 5, 2009 . . . Rodriguez became very angry\n       in his voice of tone . . . [and] aimed [a] gun at me\n       and cocked it back. . . . Defendant had no reason,\n       justification to aim a gun at me . . . . I’ve filed com-\n       plaints against defendant and defendant is retaliating\n       against me.\n\n       .....\n\n       Count IV Eighth Amendment[:] . . . On date of 07/\n       05/09 . . . Mr. Rodriguez begain [sic] yelling and\n       screaming[.] I (inmate) acknowledged him aim a 12\n       gauge directly at me. Cock it back and repeat[ed]ly\n       yelling and screaming. I (inmate) then stated “What\n\f1738                  WATISON v. CARTER\n    you want?” C/O Mr. Rodriguez then with draw the\n    gun back. I filed an emergency grievance and\n    exhausted the grievance process and been denied.\n    And I’m now being harassed by the same officer.\n\n   [10] Because Watison labeled this claim as an Eighth\nAmendment claim, the district court addressed it as such and\ndismissed it. Watison argues that the district court should\nhave treated the claim as a First Amendment retaliation claim,\ncharacterizing Rodriguez’s gun-pointing as retaliation for\ngrievances Watison filed against him. In fact, the complaint\nalleged that Watison filed a grievance in response to the gun-\npointing incident, and that he is “now being harassed” in retal-\niation for that grievance. If there is any retaliation claim\nagainst Rodriguez to be found in Watison’s complaint, then,\nit is that Rodriguez is now “harass[ing]” Watison in retalia-\ntion for the emergency grievance Watison filed against Rodri-\nguez. This harassment-retaliation claim fails. Watison alleged\nno facts about Rodriguez’s alleged harassing behavior, and he\nfailed to allege that the harassment constitutes chilling con-\nduct, is connected to Watison’s filing of the emergency griev-\nance, and lacks a penological justification. The district court\nproperly dismissed this claim.\n\n   [11] However, on remand, the district court should grant\nWatison leave to amend this claim to correct its deficiencies.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a trial\ncourt shall grant leave to amend freely “when justice so\nrequires.” “[A] district court should grant leave to amend even\nif no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it deter-\nmines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the\nallegation of other facts.” Doe v.

The\n“rule favoring liberality in amendments to pleadings is partic-\nularly important for the pro se litigant.” Lopez, 203 F.3d at\n1131 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Watison might\ncure his pleadings by alleging more facts—namely, the what,\nwhen, and where of Rodriguez’s alleged harassing behavior;\n\f                      WATISON v. CARTER                    1739\nthe harassment’s chilling effect; its connection to the griev-\nance Watison filed against Rodriguez; and the absence of a\npenological justification for Rodriguez’s behavior.\n\n                              IV.\n\n   In addition to federal constitutional claims, Watison alleged\neleven claims under Nevada Revised Statutes §§ 197.200\n(oppression under color of office), 197.210 (fraudulent appro-\npriation of property), 197.220 (other violations by officers),\nand 212.020 (inhumanity to prisoners)—all criminal statutes.\nThe district court dismissed these claims with prejudice, with-\nout explanation. We suspect the district court declined to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims\nonce it had dismissed the federal claims. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(c)(3).

CARTER                    1741\nreverse the dismissal with prejudice of Watison’s state-law\nclaims and remand with instructions to decide whether to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.\n\n  Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n  AFFIRMED        in   part,   REVERSED        in   part,   and\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\nNOONAN, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:\n\n   I concur except as to the holding that dismisses Watison’s\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment. The incident central to\nthis claim is, for good reason, one that has not been the sub-\nject of appellate litigation: the grossness of the conduct\nalleged is not likely to have often occurred. In a word, a pris-\noner sitting in his own cell on his toilet was allegedly rubbed\non his thigh by a prison guard who had entered the cell. The\nsexual implications of this stroking plus the interference with\nthe prisoner’s discharge of his bladder amounted to the inflic-\ntion of psychological pain. Given the privacy allegedly\ninvaded, this kind of pain was sufficiently serious to consti-\ntute constitutionally prohibited cruelty.\n\n   We do not have, and need not have, a precedent exactly\ngoverning the case. A century ago the Supreme Court set out\nthe governing principle:\n\n    Time works changes, brings into existence new con-\n    ditions and purposes. Therefore a principle to be\n    vital must be capable of wider application than the\n    mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true\n    of constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments,\n    designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use\n    the words of Chief Justice Marshall, ‘designed to\n    approach immortality as nearly as human institutions\n\f1742                  WATISON v. CARTER\n    can approach it.’ The future is their care and provi-\n    sion for events of good and bad tendencies of which\n    no prophecy can be made. In the application of a\n    constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be\n    only of what has been but of what may be. Under\n    any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy\n    of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and\n    power. Its general principles would have little value\n    and be converted by precedent into impotent and\n    lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be\n    lost in reality. And this has been recognized. The\n    meaning and vitality of the Constitution have devel-\n    oped against narrow and restrictive construction.\n\nWeems v.
