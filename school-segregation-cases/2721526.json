DIETZ, JUDGE PRESIDING</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong><hr>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span></span>\tIn June 2001, a Travis County jury awarded a verdict for over thirty-two million\r\ndollars against Fire Insurance Exchange, a member of the Farmers Insurance Group (\"FIE\"), for its\r\nhandling of Mary Melinda Ballard's<sup> (1)</sup> homeowner's insurance claims, which began as a single claim\r\nfor water damage to a hardwood floor and evolved to include mold contamination of the entire house\r\nand outbuildings.  FIE contends in eleven issues on appeal that the evidence was legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's liability findings; the district court erred in denying transfer of\r\nvenue to Hays County; the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's\r\nfindings that FIE failed to appoint a competent, independent appraiser and that the appraisal decision\r\nwas rendered as a result of fraud, accident, or mistake; the district court abused its discretion in\r\nnumerous evidentiary rulings; there was no evidence of a knowing violation; the punitive damages\r\naward is excessive; there was no evidence to support the mental anguish award; there was\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the attorneys' fees award; and there was no basis for the statutory\r\npenalty under article 21.55 of the insurance code.  <span><em>See </em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.55, § 6 (West\r\nSupp. 2003).</span>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe recognize the constraints on this Court in its review of this hotly disputed case \r\nand the importance of according the proper degree of deference to the fact finder.  We have carefully\r\nreviewed the entire record.  We hew to the record below despite the metamorphosis of the parties'\r\ntheories on appeal.  We hold that probative evidence supports the district court's denial of FIE's\r\nmotion to transfer venue to Hays County.  We further conclude that the district court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in the evidentiary rulings of which FIE complains.  We also find sufficient evidence\r\nto uphold the jury's findings that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard\r\nand that FIE committed a Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) violation.  We find insufficient\r\nevidence, however, to support the jury's findings of unconscionability or fraud.  We additionally find\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser or that the appraisal decision was a result of fraud, accident, or mistake. \r\n</span><span>Because the court's charge specified that findings of either a breach of the duty of good faith and fair\r\ndealing or a DTPA violation are sufficient to uphold the jury's award of actual damages, we affirm\r\nthe actual damages award in part, in the amount of </span><span>$4,006,320.72, in addition to prejudgment and\r\npostjudgment interest as stated in the final judgment.  We reverse<span></span> the award of $176,000 for\r\nBallard's reasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe further conclude that there is no evidence to support the jury's finding that FIE\r\n\"knowingly\" breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard.  Because a finding of\r\na knowing violation is required to uphold punitive and mental anguish damages, we reverse the\r\njury's awards for these damages and render judgment that Ballard take nothing for punitive and\r\nmental anguish damages.  We uphold the district court's award of the article 21.55 statutory penalty\r\nin part and remand the penalty for recalculation in accordance with this opinion.  We find sufficient\r\nevidence to support the award of attorneys' fees but cannot say that the amount of the award is\r\nreasonable, given our significant reduction of the jury's damages awards.  Therefore, we remand the\r\nissue of attorneys' fees to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRonald Allison, Ballard's husband, filed a separate appeal, contending that the district\r\ncourt erred in granting FIE's motion to exclude Allison's causation experts and in turn granting FIE's\r\nno-evidence motion for partial summary judgment pertaining to Allison's personal injury claims. \r\nBecause we find no error in the district court's rulings, we affirm the district court's rulings in\r\ngranting FIE's motion to exclude his causation experts and no-evidence motion for partial summary\r\njudgment pertaining to Allison's personal injury claims.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\r\njudgment dismissing Allison's personal injury claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1990, Ballard bought a large house in Dripping Springs, Texas, for $275,000 in\r\na foreclosure sale.  The main house was approximately 7,400 square feet, with several outbuildings,\r\nincluding a nanny's apartment (also referred to as the groundskeeper's house), a garage, and a barn. \r\nIn late 1992, Ballard began insuring the house with FIE.  The amount of coverage remained steady\r\nover the next few years, except for cost-of-living adjustments.  The coverage in late 1998 was\r\n$313,000 for the house and $187,800 for the contents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWithin a couple of years before the claims at issue, which began in December 1998,\r\nthe Ballard house had a few plumbing leaks.  In 1996 and 1997, Ballard filed two claims for\r\nplumbing leaks caused by frozen pipes; FIE paid $60,000 to $70,000 for the 1997 claim.  She did\r\nnot make another claim until December 1998 but continued to have plumbing leaks.  In late 1997,\r\nBallard had a toilet leak repaired in the downstairs half bathroom, which required another repair in\r\nJanuary 1998.  The leak caused damage to the bathroom carpet pad and wood subflooring, both of\r\nwhich were replaced in February 1998.  The same month, Ballard notified Richard Roberts of\r\nDouble R Floors that some of the boards in the downstairs hardwood floor were warping.  Roberts\r\ntook a moisture reading in the area of warping, which read nineteen to twenty percent.  The normal\r\nmoisture content of hardwood floors is around twelve percent.  He then replaced some of the boards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe plumber returned a third time to repair the half bath toilet leak in July 1998.  In\r\nAugust 1998, Ballard notified Roberts of more hardwood floor warping and buckling.  He took\r\nanother moisture measurement, which was seventeen to eighteen percent, then replaced more boards. \r\nIn October 1998, Ballard called Roberts again to report more hardwood floor damage.  The moisture\r\nmeasurement was fifteen to sixteen percent, and Roberts replaced more boards.  Roberts examined\r\nthe floor again in December 1998 and took a moisture reading of fourteen to fifteen percent.  At that\r\ntime, Roberts said that the damage was too extensive to do any more spot repairs.  He recommended\r\nthat Ballard file a claim under her homeowner's insurance policy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 17, 1998, Ballard filed a claim with FIE for the water damage to the\r\nhardwood floor.  An outside adjuster inspected the floor on December 22 and at first opined that the\r\ndamage was caused by foundation settling, which is not covered under the homeowner's policy. \r\nAfter seeing two areas of water damage, he reconsidered and requested plumbing tests.  The claim\r\nwas assigned to Theresa McConnell, an adjuster in FIE's Austin foundation claims office, who\r\nreceived the file on December 30, 1998.  McConnell's original estimate of the claim was around\r\n$100,000, and her level of authority was $20,000.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn the same day, the Gerloff Company, a plumbing contractor, performed tests at\r\nFIE's request and found no leaks.  McConnell contacted Jeff Jackson, a civil engineer, to determine\r\nthe amount and cause of damage to the hardwood floor.  In the meantime, Ballard obtained bids to\r\nreplace the hardwood floor, ranging from approximately $89,000 to $171,000.  The $89,000 bid,\r\nfrom Boatright Floors, increased to $127,950 after Ballard requested that the floor be custom made,\r\nnot manufactured, as was the original floor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcConnell and Jackson went to the Ballard home on January 7, 1999, so that Jackson\r\ncould inspect the damage.  Jackson found two sources of moisture, one in the half bathroom and one\r\naround the refrigerator.  On January 11, McConnell sent a letter to Ballard stating that \"complete\r\nplumbing tests of your residence were conducted by Gerloff Co., Inc.  No leaks were located in the\r\nplumbing system of your residence.\"  On January 12, Jackson requested additional testing of the\r\nmoisture sources.  The additional test showed that the moisture level of the floor was twelve percent.\r\nBallard sent a letter to McConnell expressing concern that the buckled floors presented a tripping\r\nhazard; McConnell suggested temporary repairs while the claim was being investigated, including\r\ncovering the areas with carpet or replacing the buckled pieces with plywood.  Ballard agreed to\r\ncarpeting the entire floor or replacing the boards in \"trouble\" areas, but the temporary repairs were\r\nnever made.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcConnell requested an appraisal of the house by an independent appraiser because\r\nshe was concerned that the house was underinsured.  The appraiser valued the house at\r\napproximately $749,000.  McConnell notified Ballard of the appraisal, and Ballard requested\r\nincreased coverage if her current coverage was not adequate.  In early March, FIE increased the\r\ncoverage to $750,000 for the house and $450,000 for the contents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the meantime, on February 8, McConnell sent a letter to Ballard stating that FIE\r\nneeded a forty-five-day extension to complete the claim investigation.  At approximately this same\r\ntime, Ballard hired an attorney to represent her.  On February 24, FIE paid Ballard $108,316.50 for\r\naccidental water discharge damage to the floor, based on the $127,950 Boatright estimate, less\r\ndepreciation and the deductible.  FIE imposed an underinsurance penalty, paying the depreciated\r\nvalue instead of replacement cost, because the house, recently reappraised, was insured for only\r\n$313,000 at the time of the December 1998 claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn March 4, McConnell and contractors went to the Ballard home to inspect newly\r\ndiscovered damage, which was assigned a new claim number.  Ballard's lawyer was present for this\r\nmeeting and notified FIE in writing on March 11 that he was representing Ballard and that all contact\r\nconcerning the claims should be with him instead of Ballard.  At Ballard's request, FIE sent a\r\ntechnician to determine if her refrigerator was still leaking; the report showed additional damage\r\nbehind the refrigerator.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn early April, Ballard met Bill Holder, an indoor air quality consultant, on a plane\r\nflight.  Upon hearing about the damage to Ballard's house and physical symptoms that her family\r\nwas having, Holder suggested that she might have a mold problem.  Holder came to the Ballard\r\nhouse on April 5 at Ballard's insistence to take some air samples.  The samples contained mold\r\nspores, including a type of mold called <em>stachybotrys</em>, which produces toxins that may cause health\r\nproblems.  On April 7, Ballard's lawyer sent a letter notifying FIE of the mold findings.  Ballard,\r\nconcerned about possible health effects of the mold, moved with her husband, Ron, and three-year-old son to the nanny's apartment.  FIE's attorney suggested on April 8 that the parties mediate their\r\ndispute.  Meanwhile, Holder met with Ballard, McConnell, and Steve Shelburne, McConnell's\r\nsupervisor, on April 13 to discuss the mold findings.  At the meeting, Holder explained the possible\r\nhealth effects of mold and that mold grows \"exponentially.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE sent engineers from Rimkus Consulting to take air samples on April 14.  Holder\r\nand others returned to the house to conduct tests on April 21.  On April 23, Holder told Ballard that,\r\nbased on the new test results, she and her family immediately needed to move out of the house. \r\nBallard's family took Holder's advice and left the house that day, leaving behind their belongings. \r\nThey and their nanny moved into the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, which FIE agreed to pay for until\r\na more permanent location was found.  Ballard and her family moved out of the Four Seasons and\r\ninto a rental home around June 1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAround the same time, FIE paid about $8,000 for a shower leak claim in late April,\r\nabout $25,000 for damage related to an ice-maker leak claim in late April, and about $45,900 for\r\nsupplemental damage to walls and sheet rock in early May.  On May 5, Ballard filed suit in Travis\r\nCounty against FIE for breach of contract, deceptive trade practices, breach of the duty of good faith\r\nand fair dealing in the claims handling process, and negligence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn preparation for mediation, also in May, Rimkus prepared an estimate to remediate\r\nand repair the house and the contents, which totaled $382,000.  Ballard's expert estimated that\r\nremediation would cost approximately $1,015,500.  The parties proceeded to mediation for three\r\ndays in late May, which ended unsuccessfully on May 27.  That same day, FIE invoked the appraisal\r\nprovision of the insurance policy, available if the parties do not agree on valuation of a claim.  Under\r\nthe appraisal provision, both parties were to choose independent appraisers to evaluate the claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE notified Ballard in its May 27 letter that it had designated Peter de la Mora, a\r\nstructural engineer with extensive experience in the construction industry, as its appraiser.  Ballard\r\nchose as her appraiser an attorney, who had to resign a few months later because of trial obligations. \r\nBoth parties agreed that Michael Schless, a former county-court-at-law judge, would be the\r\n\"umpire,\" as termed in the policy, to whom the appraisers would submit their differences if they\r\nfailed to agree on the amount of loss.  Ballard then chose another attorney, Mike Duffy, as her\r\nsuccessor appraiser in November 1999.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFrom May through July 1999, Ballard submitted additional claims for leaks in the\r\nroof, two leaks in the water tank room, water damage in the garage and barn, water damage under\r\nthe kitchen sink, leaks in the nanny's apartment, loose tiles on the porch, and a fountain leak.  In\r\nJune, Sandra Clanton replaced Theresa McConnell as the adjuster.  On August 30, FIE paid\r\napproximately $382,000 for mold remediation and repair of the house and contents.  Ballard's\r\nattorney returned the checks on the ground that the payments were based on \"invalid\" bids.  In\r\nFebruary 2000, FIE again tendered checks for approximately $382,000, which Ballard's attorney\r\ndeposited into the registry of the court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe appraisal process continued for several months, then the appraisers met for four \r\ndays in November 2000 to determine the amount of loss.  The appraisal decision, issued on\r\nNovember 16, 2000, awarded $1,287,092.72, deducting amounts that FIE had previously paid, for\r\nthe house, its contents, and additional living expenses.  Although both appraisers and the umpire\r\nsigned the decision, only FIE's appraiser and the umpire agreed to the amount of the award.  On\r\nNovember 18, FIE sent checks for the amount of the appraisal decision to Ballard's attorney, who\r\nagain deposited the checks into the registry of the court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMeanwhile, the lawsuit proceeded, with the parties conducting discovery and various\r\nhearings.  FIE filed a motion to transfer venue to Hays County, where the house was located, on the\r\nground that venue was mandatory in Hays County because this was a property damage claim.  The\r\ndistrict court denied the motion to transfer venue in November 1999.  FIE later sought to exclude\r\nRonald Allison's personal injury claims on the ground that the toxic effects of mold were not\r\nsufficiently established in the scientific community.  Just before trial, the district court excluded\r\nAllison's claims on the basis that his expert witnesses did not have reliable epidemiological studies\r\nabout the health effects of exposure to mold.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe case proceeded to trial on May 7, 2001.  The jury began deliberations on May 30,\r\n2001 and returned a verdict in favor of Ballard the next day.  The jury awarded $2,547,350 to replace\r\nthe home; $1,154,175 to remediate the home; $2,000,000 to replace the contents of the home;\r\n$350,000 for past and future additional living expenses; $176,000 for Ballard's costs of the appraisal\r\nprocess; $5,000,000 for Ballard's mental anguish; $12,000,000 in punitive damages; and $8,891,000\r\nfor attorneys' fees.  The district court rendered a final judgment on October 30, 2001, for over $33\r\nmillion, reducing actual damages by $2,045,204.28 (the total amount that FIE had already paid to\r\nBallard on her claims) and including prejudgment interest and a statutory penalty under article 21.55\r\nof the insurance code on portions of the award.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE filed motions for new trial, for remittitur, and  to modify the judgment.  The\r\ndistrict court denied the motion for remittitur.  The motions for new trial and  to modify the judgment\r\nwere overruled by operation of law.  Allison appeals the district court's rulings concerning the\r\nexclusion of his causation expert witnesses.  FIE appeals all of the jury's findings and several district\r\ncourt rulings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>ALLISON'S APPEAL</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn two issues, Allison urges that the district court erred in granting FIE's\r\n<em>Daubert</em>/<em>Robinson</em> motion to exclude causation opinions of expert witnesses and as a result granting\r\nFIE's no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment as to Allison's personal injury claims.<strong>  </strong><em>See\r\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.</em>, 509 U.S. 579 (1993); <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.\r\nRobinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. 1995).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong><em>FIE's Motion to Exclude Causation Opinions</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his first issue, Allison contends that the district court erred in granting FIE's\r\nmotion to exclude causation opinions of expert witnesses.  In <em>Robinson</em>, the Texas Supreme Court\r\nheld that rule of evidence 702 requires proponents of scientific expert testimony to satisfy the test\r\nfor admissibility formulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert</em>. <em> </em>Tex. R. Evid. 702;\r\n<em>Robinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d at 556.  A two-part test governs whether expert testimony is admissible: (1)\r\nthe expert must be qualified, and (2) the testimony must be relevant and based on a reliable\r\nfoundation.  <em>Robinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d at 556.<em>  </em>According to this test, the trial judge must act as a\r\n\"gatekeeper\" and decide whether a qualified expert's testimony is relevant and reliable.  <em>Daubert</em>,\r\n509 U.S. at 589; <em>Robinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d at 556-57.

The test is not\r\nwhether the facts present an appropriate case for the trial court's action in the opinion of the\r\nreviewing court. </span><span><strong></strong><em></em></span><span><em>Id.</em></span><span><em></em><strong></strong></span><span>  Rather, we will gauge an abuse of discretion by whether the trial court acted\r\nwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles. </span><span> <strong></strong><em></em></span><span><em>Id.</em></span><span><em></em><strong></strong></span><span>  Thus, a trial court enjoys wide latitude in\r\ndetermining whether expert testimony is admissible. <em> See Olin</em>, 990 S.W.2d at 795.</span><span><strong></strong><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tStachybotrys</em> was discovered in the Ballard home in early April 1999.  The family\r\nmoved from the main house to the nanny's apartment, then moved into a hotel on April 23, 1999,\r\nafter mold was also discovered in the apartment.  Allison began having increasing problems with\r\nconcentration and memory in April through July 1999.<em>  </em>After seeing several doctors in Austin,\r\nAllison was diagnosed with a type of brain damage called toxic encephalopathy.  Several medical\r\nprofessionals, including two leading experts in the study of the health effects of molds and\r\nmycotoxins,<sup> (2)</sup> Wayne A. Gordon, Ph.D. and Eckardt Johanning, M.D., agreed that exposure to mold\r\ncaused Allison's toxic encephalopathy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tToxic tort cases require proof of both general and specific causation about the effects\r\nof the toxic substance.  <em>Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d at 714.  \"General causation is whether a substance is\r\ncapable of causing a particular injury or condition in the general population, while specific causation\r\nis whether a substance caused a particular individual's injury.\"  <em>Id.</em>  One can prove general causation\r\neither through experiments to show that a substance is capable of causing a particular injury or by\r\nattempting to show that exposure to a substance increases the risk of a particular injury.  <em>Id. </em>at 714-15.  Specific causation cannot be based on inferred general causation; general causation must be\r\naffirmatively proved.  Among the underlying data to support Allison's proof of general causation\r\nwas a study by Dr. Gordon and Dr. Johanning of twenty people who were exposed to mold in a\r\nbuilding.  The district court found that although the experts' foundational data to prove general\r\ncausation met the requirements of <em>Daubert</em> and <em>Robinson</em>, the data was unreliable according to the\r\nfactors discussed in <em>Havner</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe question in <em>Havner</em> was whether the experts' foundational data was sufficiently\r\nreliable to show that the drug Bendectin caused birth defects.  In <em>Havner</em>, as here, the underlying data\r\nincluded epidemiological studies, which \"examine existing populations to determine if there is an\r\nassociation between a disease or condition and a factor suspected of causing that disease or\r\ncondition.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 715.  The <em>Havner </em>court determined that for an epidemiological study to be a\r\nreliable foundation, it must be unbiased in its design, otherwise properly designed, properly\r\nexecuted, and show that exposure to the substance more than doubles the risk of injury.  <em>Id.</em> at 717-19.  Another factor for determining if an epidemiological study is reliable is that it must be capable\r\nof repetition with the same results ninety-five percent of the time, known as a confidence interval\r\nof ninety-five percent.  <em>Id.</em> at 723.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAllison argues that the district court incorrectly applied <em>Havner</em> because \"[t]he\r\ndecision clearly states that epidemiology is a permissive, not mandatory, type of evidence that a\r\nplaintiff may choose in a toxic tort case.\"  But the <em>Havner</em> court concluded that <em>if</em> an expert relies on\r\nepidemiological studies, those studies must meet certain criteria.  <em>Id.</em>  Considering the totality of the\r\nevidence presented by Allison, a crucial underpinning for the opinions of Allison's causation experts\r\nwas an epidemiological study; therefore, the district court appropriately determined that the factors\r\ndiscussed in <em>Havner</em> applied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Gordon testified in his deposition that calculation of a confidence interval for the\r\nresults of the study was \"premature.\"  A calculation of the risk factor was also premature. \r\nAdditionally, Dr. Gordon could not say whether the techniques used were generally accepted.  The\r\nepidemiological study on which Allison's experts relied therefore does not meet the <em>Havner</em>\r\nrequirement of a ninety-five percent confidence interval, nor does it show that exposure to the\r\nsubstance more than doubles the risk of injury.  <em>Id.</em> at 717-18, 722-23.  </span><span>Further, the causation experts'\r\ntestimony was not based on a reliable foundation as required by <em>Havner</em>.  If an expert relies on\r\nunreliable foundational data, any opinion drawn from that data is likewise unreliable.  </span><span><em></em></span><span><em>Id.</em> at 714</span><span><em></em></span><span>. \r\nBecause Allison did not establish a reliable foundation for the admission of general causation\r\nevidence, we need not address the evidence relating to specific causation.  </span><span>Therefore, we cannot</span><span> say\r\nthat the district court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of Allison's causation experts. \r\nAccordingly, we overrule Allison's first issue and uphold the district court's order excluding the\r\ntestimony of Allison's causation experts.</span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>FIE's No-Evidence Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his second issue, Allison contends that the district court erred in granting FIE's no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment as to Allison's personal injury claims.  A party\r\nseeking a no-evidence summary judgment must assert that no evidence exists as to one or more of\r\nthe essential elements of the nonmovant's claims on which it would have the burden of proof at trial. \r\n<em>Holmstrom v. Lee</em>, 26 S.W.3d 526, 530 (Tex. App.--Austin 2000, no pet.).  A no-evidence summary\r\njudgment is properly granted if the nonmovant fails to bring forth more than a scintilla of probative\r\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of the nonmovant's claim\r\non which the nonmovant would have the burden of proof at trial.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i);\r\n<em>Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d at 711.  If the evidence supporting an element rises to a level that would enable\r\nreasonable, fair-minded persons to differ in their conclusions, then more than a scintilla of evidence\r\nexists.  <em>Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d at 711.  Less than a scintilla of evidence exists when the evidence is \"so\r\nweak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion\" of fact, and the legal effect is that\r\nthere is no evidence. <em> Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc.</em>, 650 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Tex. 1983).  A no-evidence\r\nsummary judgment is essentially a directed verdict granted before trial, to which we apply a legal\r\nsufficiency standard of review.  <em>Jackson v. Fiesta Mart</em>, 979 S.W.2d 68, 70 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\n1998, no pet.).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen, as here, the summary judgment states the ground or grounds on which the\r\ndistrict court based its decision to render summary judgment, we will affirm the summary judgment\r\nif one of those grounds is meritorious.  <em></em></span><span><em>See State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

The district court granted the motion based on the exclusion of Allison's\r\ncausation experts.</span><span>  Because Allison could no longer prove the essential element of proximate cause\r\nin his personal injury claims, the district court properly granted FIE's no-evidence motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment as to Allison's personal injury claims.  Therefore, we overrule Allison's second\r\nissue and affirm the district court's judgment dismissing Allison's personal injury claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong><center>FIE'S APPEAL</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in eleven issues, with several sub-issues, that the evidence was legally\r\nand factually insufficient to support the jury's liability findings; the district court erred in denying\r\ntransfer of venue to Hays County; the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the\r\njury's findings that FIE failed to appoint a competent, independent appraiser and that the appraisal\r\ndecision was rendered as a result of fraud, accident, or mistake; the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in numerous evidentiary rulings; there was no evidence of a knowing violation; the\r\npunitive damages award is excessive; there was no evidence to support the mental anguish award;\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to support the attorneys' fees award; and there was no basis for the\r\nstatutory penalty under article 21.55 of the insurance code.  We will address the venue issue first,\r\ngiven the emphasis that both parties gave to this issue in their briefs and at oral argument.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Venue</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe must first decide whether venue was appropriate in Travis County, even though\r\nthe property at issue is located in Hays County.  In its fourth issue, FIE contends that the district\r\ncourt erred in denying its motion to transfer venue to Hays County.  Because the civil practice and\r\nremedies code allows the interlocutory review of an order denying a motion based on mandatory\r\nvenue and FIE elected not to seek such review, Ballard urges that FIE waived its right to transfer by\r\nforegoing interlocutory review.  We reject this position because it is inconsistent with the permissive\r\nnature of sections 15.064 and 15.0642.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§ 15.064(b), 15.0642\r\n(West 2002) (allowing either an appeal of a venue determination after a trial on the merits or an\r\napplication for writ of mandamus to enforce a mandatory venue provision).</span><span>  </span><span>Ballard brought suit in\r\nTravis County on the permissive venue grounds that all or a substantial part of the actions giving rise\r\nto the claim occurred there and that FIE's principal place of business is there.  <em>See id.</em> § 15.002(a)(1),\r\n(3) (general rule for venue).  Section 15.002 lists several choices for permissive venue and applies\r\nto all lawsuits unless a mandatory venue provision or another permissive venue provision applies. \r\n<em>See id. </em>§ 15.002(a).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argues that venue lies in Hays County because the lawsuit is for damage to the\r\nBallard house, which is in Hays County.  Asserting that the nature of Ballard's causes of action is\r\nirrelevant, FIE further contends that \"[i]f any of Ballard's causes of actions sought recovery of\r\ndamage to her home, the trial court had no discretion to deny the motion.\"  We disagree.  The venue\r\nprovision that FIE asserts is applicable and mandatory provides that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[a]ctions for recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property, for\r\npartition of real property, to remove encumbrances from the title to real property, for\r\nrecovery of damages to real property<em>,</em> or to quiet title to real property shall be brought\r\nin the county in which all or a part of the property is located.</span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id. </em>§ 15.011.  When considering venue, we note that the legislature's use of the word \"shall\" in a\r\nstatute generally indicates the mandatory character of the provision.  <em>Id.</em> § 15.004;<em> Wichita County\r\nv. Hart</em>, 917 S.W.2d 779, 781 (Tex. 1996)<em>. </em> Because of the mandatory nature of section 15.011, we\r\nwill strictly construe it and will not hold that it applies unless Ballard's suit falls clearly within one\r\nof the categories in the section.  <em>See Bennett v.

R. Civ. P. 86;<em> Wichita County</em>, 917 S.W.2d at\r\n781.  That mandatory venue lies in another county provides one ground for a motion to transfer\r\nvenue.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 86(3)(b).  If a plaintiff's chosen venue rests on a permissive venue statute\r\nand the defendant files a meritorious motion to transfer based on a mandatory venue provision, the\r\ntrial court must grant the motion.  <em>See Wichita County</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 781.  A trial court's erroneous\r\ndenial of a motion to transfer venue requires reversal of the judgment and remand for a new trial. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.064(b); </span><span><em>Ruiz v. Conoco, Inc.</em>, 868 S.W.2d 752, 757\r\n(Tex. 1993).</span><span>  In determining whether venue was proper, we review the entire record, including the\r\ntrial on the merits.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.064(b); <em>Ruiz</em>, 868 S.W.2d at 758.<em>  </em></span><span>If we\r\nfind probative evidence to support the district court's determination, even if there is a preponderance\r\nof the evidence to the contrary, we will defer to the district court's determination.  <em>Ruiz</em>, 868 S.W.2d\r\nat 758.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argued at the hearing on its motion to transfer venue that although Ballard's case\r\ninvolved multiple causes of action, including breach of contract, deceptive trade practices, breach\r\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing insurance claim, and Allison's personal injury claims</span><span>, the\r\ndominant purpose of Ballard's lawsuit was to recover damages to real property.  </span><span>Under this test, a\r\ncourt looks to the dominant purpose of the lawsuit, </span><span>solely from the facts alleged in the plaintiff's\r\npetition, the rights asserted, and the relief sought, to determine whether it falls under a mandatory\r\nvenue provision.  <em>See Maranatha Temple</em>, 833 S.W.2d at 738.  FIE now argues on appeal that the\r\nlegislature abrogated the dominant-purpose test with the enactment of section 15.004 of the civil\r\npractice and remedies code in 1995.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.004 (if lawsuit\r\nhas two or more claims arising from same transaction or occurrence, with one claim governed by a\r\nmandatory venue provision and another governed by a permissive venue provision, the mandatory\r\nvenue provision controls); <em>see also Marshall v. Mahaffey</em>, 974 S.W.2d 942, 947 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Beaumont 1998, pet. denied).<em>  </em>We agree with FIE's current position to this extent:  If we find\r\nthe mandatory provision applies but it is in conflict with a permissive rule, the mandatory provision\r\ncontrols.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.004</span><span>; <em>Wichita County</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 781.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>  Upon\r\nour review of the record, we conclude that although section 15.011 is a mandatory venue provision,\r\nit does not apply here.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argues that the phrase \"recovery of damages to real property\" is not ambiguous,\r\nbut is instead \"crystal clear.\"  Because in 1995 the legislature reinstated the clause in section 15.011,<sup> (5)</sup>\r\nFIE urges that the mandatory venue provision was thereby broadened to include any injury to\r\nBallard's home.  By any reasonable construction, we may not read the provision by the expansive\r\ninterpretation that FIE would have us adopt.  Even though FIE urges this Court to read \"plain and\r\ncommon meaning\" into its reading of the statute, accepted principles of construction require that the\r\nprovision in question be construed in its present context and given a rational meaning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf we were to look at the words \"recovery of damages to real property\" in isolation,\r\nwe would concede that the phrase may be sufficiently broad to encompass the expansive reading\r\nurged by FIE.  But we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole. \r\nContrary to FIE's assertion that the nature of the causes of action is irrelevant and that only the\r\nremedy sought is relevant, section 15.011 specifically addresses five types of \"actions\" relating to\r\n\"Land\"--the title of the section<sup> (6)</sup>--that mandate venue in a particular county.  The <em>actions </em>are:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tfor recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tfor partition of real property,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tto remove encumbrances from the title to real property,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tfor recovery of damages to real property, or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tto quiet title to real property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.011.  That the word \"action\" must be read to modify each\r\nof these is clear beyond cavil.  Thus, we must look to the \"true\" nature of the action to determine\r\nwhether the mandatory venue provision applies.  <em>Renwar Oil Corp. v. Lancaster</em>, 276 S.W.2d 774,\r\n775 (Tex. 1955); <em>see also Yzaguirre v. KCS Res., Inc.</em>, 53 S.W.3d 368, 371 (Tex. 2001).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore the addition of the phrase \"recovery of damages to real property,\" the venue\r\nprovision applied only when the suit directly involved a question of title to land.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em>\r\nYzaguirre</em>, 53 S.W.3d at 371 (mandatory venue provision does not apply because suit does not\r\ninvolve recovering real property or quieting title); <em>Maranatha Temple</em>, 833 S.W.2d at 738; <em>Scarth\r\nv. First Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em>, 711 S.W.2d 140, 141-42 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1986, no writ).  We have\r\nbeen cited to no authority that supports expanding the scope of the provision beyond questions\r\nrelating to the recovery of real property or affecting title to \"land.\"  Except to make it explicit that\r\nthe provision in question allows for the recovery of damages in such a suit relating to land, there is\r\nno indication that the legislature sought to broaden the provision with the addition of the phrase. \r\nThat the phrase \"for recovery of damages to real property\" was sandwiched between \"to remove\r\nencumbrances from the title\" and \"to quiet title\" further bolsters our reading.  Reading the relevant\r\nphrase in its entire context, then, gives support for the more narrow interpretation.  <em>See </em>1 Scott\r\nBrister, et al., <em>Texas Pretrial Practice</em> § 9.34 (2000).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWere we to interpret the provision to allow for mandatory venue in all instances in\r\nwhich any damages are sought relating to a dwelling, no matter the nature of the action, we believe\r\nwe would be extending beyond permissible bounds the statute's language.  The doctrine of\r\nconstruction, <em>noscitur a sociis--</em>a word is known by the company it keeps--seems particularly apt\r\nhere to avoid ascribing to one clause a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying\r\nclauses, thus giving unintended breadth to the provision as a whole.  <em>See County of Harris v. Eaton</em>,\r\n573 S.W.2d 177, 181 (Tex. 1978) (Steakley, J., dissenting) (discussing the maxim of <em>noscitur a\r\nsociis</em>: \"the meaning of particular terms in a statute may be ascertained by reference to words\r\nassociated with them in the statute; and that where two or more words of analogous meaning are\r\nemployed together in a statute, they are understood to be used in their cognate sense, to express the\r\nsame relations and give color and expression to each other.\").  The phrase must be understood\r\nagainst the background of what the legislature was attempting to accomplish in restoring a damage\r\nprovision to the section, thereby completing the availability of an array of remedies to actions\r\ninvolving \"land.\"</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Ballard brought actions for negligence, negligence per se, breach of contract,\r\ndeceptive trade practices, and breach of good faith and fair dealing in insurance claims handling, all\r\nof which allegedly caused damages to the Ballard house.  Because the suit does not involve\r\nrecovering real property or quieting title or seeking damages for such loss, the district court correctly\r\nconcluded that the mandatory venue provisions of section 15.011 do not apply.  We therefore\r\noverrule FIE's fourth issue.<em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Legal and Factual Sufficiency</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE next contends in several issues that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's findings.  We will first address the standards of review for \r\nchallenges to legal and factual sufficiency.  Challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence must\r\nbe sustained when the record discloses one of the following: (1) a complete absence of evidence of\r\na vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only\r\nevidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than\r\na mere scintilla of evidence; or (4) the evidence established conclusively the opposite of a vital fact.\r\n</span><span><em></em></span><span><em>See Havner</em>, </span><span></span><span>953 S.W.2d at 711.  In reviewing legal sufficiency, we are required to determine\r\nwhether the proffered evidence as a whole rises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.  </span><span><em></em></span><span><em>See Transportation Ins.

Croucher</em>,<em> </em></span><span></span><span>660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983).\r\nIn reviewing a no-evidence issue, we are to consider only the evidence favoring the finding,\r\ndisregarding all direct and circumstantial evidence to the contrary.  <em>Lenz v.

We may\r\nnot reverse merely because we conclude that the evidence preponderates toward an affirmative\r\nanswer.  <em>See Herbert v. Herbert</em>, 754 S.W.2d 141, 144 (Tex. 1988).  To assist with the analysis of\r\nFIE's legal and factual sufficiency challenges, we will summarize FIE's acts of which Ballard\r\ncomplains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>The Complained-of Acts</em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the trial was long and the arguments complex, </span><span>each of Ballard's causes of\r\naction revolve around the following core of complained-of acts:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t1.\tPlumbing test</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs part of FIE's insurance code violation, Ballard complains that Theresa McConnell\r\nmisrepresented to her that \"complete\" plumbing tests had been performed on the house even though\r\nMcConnell \"secretly\" thought that there might be other leaks.  In December 1998, Ballard reported\r\na claim that her hardwood floor was water-damaged.  FIE retained the Gerloff Company, a plumbing\r\ncontractor, to determine whether there was an ongoing leak causing the floor to remain wet.  On\r\nJanuary 11, 1999, McConnell forwarded a copy of the Gerloff report to Ballard.  The report\r\ndescribed the procedures employed and time taken to test  the building drain piping, domestic water\r\npiping, and air conditioning condensate lines, and further stated that no shower pan test was\r\nconducted.  Enclosing a copy of the plumbing test results, McConnell represented in a cover letter\r\nthat \"[c]omplete plumbing tests of your residence were performed . . . .  No leaks were located in the\r\nplumbing system of your residence.\"  A Gerloff plumber testified that the tests were complete\r\naccording to his company's procedures.  He testified that he was asked to do a complete test and that\r\nit was a \"complete test of the plumbing system, going by our procedures.\"  The tests were complete\r\nin the context of the leaks that existed on December 30, 1998, when the testing was done. \r\nMcConnell's concerns about the possibility of additional leaks were not secret.  Despite the report\r\nthat no leaks were found, she contacted Jeff Jackson, a civil engineer, to determine the amount and\r\ncause of damage to the hardwood floor.  In her cover letter enclosing the Gerloff report, McConnell\r\nstated that Jackson had been retained in the investigation of the claim and the \"cause of the problem\"\r\ncontinued.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t2.\tCompletion-of-claim letter</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcConnell wrote a letter to Ballard on February 8 saying that FIE required a forty-five-day extension because \"[t]he additional time is needed to complete our claim investigation.\" \r\nMcConnell admitted at trial that FIE had all of the information that it needed to evaluate the claim\r\nbut that she needed the additional time to obtain the authority from supervisors to pay the claim\r\nbecause she did not have that level of authority</span><span>.  FIE paid the claim on February 24, 1999, less than\r\nthree weeks after McConnell's letter.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t3.\tRefusal to pay claim/failure to promptly pay</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard also argues that FIE violated the insurance code because FIE admitted that\r\nas of May 17, 1999, it had obtained all of the information it needed to pay for remediation of the\r\nhouse.  She urges that FIE tendered insufficient and untimely payments.  Because of FIE's piecemeal\r\npayments and intentional delays in paying her claims after it had all of the information it needed on\r\nMay 17, 1999, Ballard contends that FIE refused to pay the claims without conducting a reasonable\r\ninvestigation of the claims and that it failed to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and\r\nequitable settlement of the claims when its liability had become reasonably clear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE paid the first claim for hardwood floor damage on February 24, 1999.  It based\r\nthe payment on a bid from Boatright Floors, less depreciation and the deductible.  FIE paid the\r\ndepreciated value instead of replacement cost because the house was underinsured.  Ballard\r\nimmediately claimed that this was a partial payment because she thought the Boatright bid was too\r\nlow.  Thereafter, Ballard began submitting other claims.  Within the next couple of months, she\r\nsubmitted a claim for a shower leak, ice maker leak, and supplemental damage to sheet rock and\r\nwalls.  FIE paid all of these claims, which Ballard again accepted as partial payments.  Nevertheless,\r\nBallard contends that because of the completion-of-claim letter, plumbing test letter, and FIE's\r\ninvocation of the appraisal provision, full payment of these claims and other pending claims was\r\ndelayed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t4.\tDenial of coverage</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard argues that FIE tried to deny the hardwood floor damage claim under an\r\nexclusion in the policy for foundation problems.  </span><span>The first adjuster to handle the claim was Sean\r\nDollery, who visited the home on December 22, 1998.  Although his initial reaction was that\r\nfoundation settling might be the cause of the hardwood floor damage, he changed his mind after\r\nseeing the water damage to the floor.  </span><span>In response to her attorney's question--\"About how long did\r\nhe talk to you about this being a slab settling problem?\"-- Ballard testified:  \"Until Richard Roberts\r\ngot there [that day] and started pulling up boards that showed the migration of water.\"  Dollery\r\nstopped suggesting that it was a slab-settling problem \"about 20 minutes after Richard Roberts had\r\npulled up some boards.\"</span><span>  From then on, FIE handled the hardwood floor damage as a covered claim.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t5.\tSham and fraudulent bids</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard complains that FIE intentionally paid her inadequate sums based on sham and\r\nfraudulent bids FIE received from contractors who subsequently refused to perform the work for the\r\namount of the bids.  These contractors were then retained by FIE as its experts in this litigation.  </span><span>FIE\r\nobtained bids from many contractors during the course of handling the claims and paid the claims\r\naccording to its own valuation, assisted by the bids.  FIE based the hardwood floor claim payment\r\non a bid from Boatright Floors, which was the lowest bid that it received.  Ballard contends that the\r\npayment was invalid because the Boatright bid was only good for thirty days and had expired by the\r\ntime that FIE made the payment on February 24, 1999.  FIE counters that it did not receive the bid\r\nuntil February 5, just a few weeks before it made payment.  After mold was discovered in the Ballard\r\nhome, FIE hired Rimkus Consulting to prepare a remediation bid.  Because Rimkus had no\r\nexperience in the relatively new field of mold remediation, its engineers talked with Ballard's\r\nconsultants to find out more about the process.  The remediation bid that Rimkus submitted in\r\npreparation for mediation was considerably less than the bid from Ballard's experts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard also contends that FIE based its August 1999 payments on expired bids,\r\nbecause two companies that had made bids would not do the work for Ballard at the prices they had\r\nquoted to FIE.  But by that time they had been retained as FIE's expert witnesses.  Ballard further\r\ncontends that de la Mora's estimates during the appraisal process were not based on like kind and\r\nquality.  De la Mora testified that he determined like kind and quality replacement costs during the\r\nappraisal process.  One of the contractors who submitted a bid to de la Mora also testified that he\r\nprepared his bid based on like kind and quality materials.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t6.\tInvocation of the appraisal provision</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBallard urges four complaints concerning FIE's invocation of the appraisal provision:\r\n(i) the mere invocation of the provision was a breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing\r\nbecause it was intended for the purposes of delay and to gain leverage in negotiations; (ii) FIE\r\ndeliberately appointed an appraiser who was not independent or competent; (iii) FIE refused to\r\ninclude all of the pending claims in the appraisal; and (iv) FIE intentionally withheld estimates and\r\ninformation from its own appraiser.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder Ballard's standard form homeowner's insurance policy, either party may\r\nrequest an appraisal if it becomes apparent that the parties cannot agree on the value of a claim or\r\nclaims.  FIE's employees testified that they invoke the appraisal provision rarely, only if it is\r\napparent that the parties cannot agree on the appraised value.  FIE asserted the provision here after\r\nan attempt to settle at mediation failed, although it was apparent long before then that Ballard and\r\nFIE did not agree about the value of her claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPeter de la Mora, a structural engineer who was FIE's appraiser, had a business\r\nrelationship with FIE before working on this appraisal.  However, he has never been an employee\r\nof FIE.  Further, FIE instructed de la Mora to determine costs on his own, not from any figures that\r\nFIE had.  He had no restriction on receiving assistance from outside experts.  He had years of\r\nexperience in the homebuilding industry.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe letter invoking the appraisal provision listed three of the five claims that were\r\npending as of late May 1999.  Ballard testified that she asked FIE to include all of the claims in the\r\nappraisal but that FIE did not want to do that, suggesting the appraisal did not cover all of her claims. \r\nDe la Mora testified that although the appraisal did not include all of the claim numbers, the fact that\r\nthe appraisal covered the entire house encompassed all of claims.  Additionally, the amendment to\r\nthe appraisal decision stated that because \"some of the claim numbers may have been improperly\r\nincluded, and [o]thers may have been improperly excluded,\" \"the Appraisal Decision was intended\r\nto be a comprehensive statement\" of the cost to remediate or replace the house, its contents, the\r\ngroundskeeper's house, plus additional living expenses, \"considering only those claims which were\r\nproperly subject to the appraisal.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t7.\tUnderinsurance</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe amount of insurance on the Ballard home was tied to the county tax appraisal,\r\nnot the resale value of the house.  In 1996, Ballard's agent told her that the insurance coverage was\r\ninsufficient to cover the full value of the home.  She replied that she wanted to keep the insurance\r\nat the value of the tax appraisal, then signed a form rejecting an increase in coverage.  The amount\r\nof insurance on the home when Ballard filed the hardwood damage claim was $313,000. \r\nMcConnell, concerned that the house might be underinsured, requested a property appraisal in\r\nJanuary 1999.  After seeing that the appraised resale value was approximately $750,000, Ballard\r\nrequested an increase in her insurance coverage.  Because this increase did not occur until after the\r\npayment of the first claim, FIE imposed an underinsurance penalty on its payment of the hardwood\r\nfloor claim.  It paid Ballard for the actual cash value of the floor, deducting depreciation, instead of\r\npaying the full replacement value.  Ballard contends that FIE thus misrepresented that her policy\r\ncovered replacement costs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t8.\tReservation-of-rights letter</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 30, 1998, FIE sent a standard form homeowner's policy reservation-of-rights letter, which restated exclusions from the policy that might apply.  Insurance companies must\r\nassert a reservation of rights or risk waiving any coverage defenses that they may have.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,\r\n<em>State Farm Lloyds v. Borum</em>, 53 S.W.3d 877, 892 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2001, pet. denied).  The fact\r\nthat the form letter contained inapplicable exclusions for damage by \"waves\" and \"earthquake\" is\r\ninconsequential.</span><span>  Furthermore, there was no evidence of any connection between this letter and how\r\nFIE handled Ballard's claims, and coverage was not at issue.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving summarized FIE's acts of which Ballard complains, we now turn to FIE's\r\nlegal and factual sufficiency challenges to the jury's findings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE urges in its first issue that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's finding that it breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard.  FIE\r\nfurther contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support a finding that its\r\nalleged breach caused damages to Ballard.  We disagree.  Some evidence supports the jury's finding\r\nthat FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing and that the breach caused damages to\r\nBallard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn insurer breaches its duty of good faith and fair dealing by denying or delaying\r\npayment of a claim when \"the insurer's liability has become reasonably clear.\"  Tex. Ins. Code Ann.\r\nart. 21.21, § 4(10)(a)(ii) (West Supp. 2003); <em>Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d 48, 55 (Tex.\r\n1997); <em>id.</em> at 69 (Hecht, J., concurring).  \"Liability for payment of a claim is reasonably clear when\r\nit is no longer fairly debatable.\"  <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 69 (Hecht, J., concurring).  The statutory\r\nstandard and common-law standard for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing are identical. \r\n<em>Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Boyte</em>, 80 S.W.3d 546, 549 (Tex. 2002) (citing <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 55; <em>id.</em>\r\nat 69 (Hecht, J., concurring)).  Evidence establishing only a bona fide coverage dispute does not\r\ndemonstrate breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.  <em>Provident Am. Ins. Co. v. Castaneda</em>,\r\n988 S.W.2d 189, 193 (Tex. 1998); <em>State Farm Lloyds v. Nicolau</em>, 951 S.W.2d 444, 448 (Tex. 1997);\r\n<em>Moriel</em>, 879 S.W.2d at 17.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe issue of the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing \"focuses not on\r\nwhether the claim was valid but on the reasonableness of the insurer's conduct\" in handling the\r\nclaim.  <em>Lyons v. Millers Cas. Ins. Co.</em>, 866 S.W.2d 597, 601 (Tex. 1993).  Reasonableness is\r\ndetermined using an objective standard of whether a reasonable insurer under similar circumstances\r\nwould have delayed or denied payment of the claim.  <em>Aranda v. Insurance Co. of N. Am.</em>, 748 S.W.2d\r\n210, 213 (Tex. 1988).  Whether an insurer breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing is a fact\r\nissue.  <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 56.  Moreover, the question of whether an insurer's conduct is\r\nreasonable in the face of acknowledged liability is one peculiarly tailored to the province of the jury. \r\n<em>See id.</em>  </span><span><em></em></span><span><em><span><strong></strong></span></em></span><span><span>In determining whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a judgment for breach\r\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing, we resolve all conflicts in the evidence and draw all\r\ninferences in favor of the jury's findings.  <em>Id.</em> at 51.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tThere is some evidence from which a jury could find that FIE failed to attempt in\r\ngood faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of claims after its liability had become\r\nreasonably clear.  <em>See </em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21, § 4(10)(a)(ii); <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 56.  FIE\r\ndoes not challenge that its liability was reasonably clear.  Its liability was only \"fairly debatable\" for\r\na brief time, when FIE's outside investigator, Sean Dollery, expressed his preliminary view that the\r\nclaim might not be covered.  <em>See</em> <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 69 (Hecht, J., concurring).  Ballard contends\r\nthat FIE, after its liability had become reasonably clear, delayed payment of the hardwood floor claim\r\nthrough its plumbing test and completion-of-claim letters.  She further contends that FIE breached\r\nits duty of good faith and fair dealing toward her by invoking the appraisal provision in May 1999,\r\nwhen at the same time it had all of the information that it needed to pay for remediation of the home. \r\nShe argues that waiting for payment of her claims during the eighteen-month appraisal process\r\nallowed mold to spread and cause irreparable damage to the house.  While Ballard alleges that other\r\nacts are part of the pattern of acts that violated article 21.21, these are the primary acts of which she\r\ncomplains.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tSome evidence shows that McConnell's lack of authority or experience in handling\r\nclaims of this magnitude caused delays in processing the claims.  McConnell knew on the first day\r\nshe received the claim that estimates to replace the hardwood floor were over $100,000.  She had\r\na level of authority only to pay claims up to $20,000 and had never worked on a claim this large. \r\nAdditionally, McConnell testified that she had sufficient information that liability was reasonably\r\nclear on the hardwood floor claim as of February 1, 1999.  Yet she wrote the February 8 letter to\r\nBallard, stating that FIE required a forty-five-day extension because \"[t]he additional time is needed\r\nto complete our claim investigation.\"  McConnell admitted at trial that FIE had all of the information\r\nthat it needed to <em>evaluate</em> the claim but that she needed the additional time to obtain the authority\r\nfrom supervisors to <em>pay</em> the claim because she did not have that level of authority.  A jury could have\r\nfound that she misrepresented to Ballard why she needed more time to handle the claim.  Ballard\r\nargues also that McConnell made a misrepresentation in the \"complete plumbing test\" letter, when\r\nin fact not all plumbing had been tested.  Both McConnell and a plumber with the Gerloff Company\r\ntestified that the term \"complete plumbing test\" is not literally true, because the standard industry\r\ntest runs through underground systems only, not any pipes above the first floor.  Although\r\nMcConnell correctly characterized the test that Gerloff performed, the jury could have reasonably\r\nconcluded that this statement was a misrepresentation.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tOther evidence called into question FIE's good faith handling of the claims.  Ballard\r\ntestified that although she \"begged\" to remove the wood floor because it was a tripping hazard,\r\nMcConnell told her that she would \"jeopardize coverage\" if she removed the floor.  McConnell\r\ntestified that Ballard could have removed the floor at any time after payment of the $108,000 to\r\nreplace the floor.  Ballard countered that she did not want to remove the floor with the claim\r\ninvestigation ongoing for months, even after she received the $108,000 payment.  She testified that\r\nshe did not remove the floor \"[b]ecause [FIE] kept calling for inspections.  And if I had torn up the\r\nfloor, there would be nothing there for them to inspect.\"  As part of the pattern of mishandling and\r\ndelay in handling her claims, Ballard also testified that FIE's large number of inspections were\r\ndesigned to harass and cause further delay.  McConnell countered that the inspections were necessary\r\nto determine the cause of the water damage and because Ballard kept submitting claims for new\r\ndamage.  The jury, as the trier of fact in this case, could have chosen to believe Ballard instead of\r\nMcConnell.  A jury judges the credibility of witnesses and the weight given their testimony.  <em>Ford\r\nv. Panhandle &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co</em>., 252 S.W.2d 561, 563 (Tex. 1952); <em>Trinity Indus., Inc. v. Ashland,\r\nInc.</em>, 53 S.W.3d 852, 862 (Tex. App.--Austin 2001, pet. denied).  It is the jury's province \"to resolve\r\nconflicts and inconsistencies  . . . in the testimony of different witnesses.\"  <em>Ford</em>, 252 S.W.2d at 563.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tFurther, Ballard presented some evidence of a pattern of failure to promptly pay that\r\ncaused further damage to the house.  The jury heard evidence that FIE had all of the information that\r\nit needed to pay the hardwood floor claim in early February but did not pay the claim until three\r\nweeks later.  Further, Ballard contended that every payment from FIE was insufficient to pay for the\r\ndamage, leading to further delays that caused the mold to spread.  The jury heard additional evidence\r\nthat although McConnell admitted that FIE had all of the information that it needed to pay for\r\nremediation of the house as of May 17, 1999, FIE instead invoked the appraisal provision after it\r\nfailed to settle the claims at mediation.  During the appraisal process, which lasted eighteen months,\r\nnothing was done to remediate the mold in Ballard's house.  The mold continued to grow.  This was\r\nsome evidence from which the jury could have determined that FIE delayed in paying the claims and\r\nthat the delay caused further damage to Ballard's house.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tAn appellate court may not substitute its judgment when a jury's finding is grounded\r\nin sufficient evidence.  <em>Trinity Indus.</em>, 53 S.W.3d at 862-63.  We are required by the standards and\r\nscope of review to credit verdicts grounded on probative evidence.  Further, the legislature requires\r\nus to \"liberally construe[]\" article 21.21. <em> </em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann art. 21.21, § 1(b) (West Supp. 2003)\r\n(\"</span></span><span><span>This Article shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes as set forth\r\nin this section.</span></span><span><span>\"); <em>see also</em> <em>Rocor Int'l, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co.</em>, 77 S.W.3d 253, 260\r\n(Tex. 2002); <em>Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel</em>, 22 S.W.3d 378, 384 (Tex. 2000).</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, we hold that there is\r\nsome evidence to support the jury's finding that FIE failed to attempt in good faith to effectuate a\r\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlement of Ballard's claims after its liability had become reasonably\r\nclear and that this failure caused damages to Ballard.  <em>See </em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann art. 21.21,\r\n§ 4(10)(a)(ii).  Weighing all of the evidence, we cannot say that it is so weak as to be clearly wrong\r\nor manifestly unjust. <em>Cain</em>, 709 S.W.2d at 176.  Accordingly, FIE's legal and factual sufficiency\r\nchallenges to the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing finding must fail.  We overrule\r\nFIE's first issue.  Even if we were to apply the standard for breach of the duty of good faith and fair\r\ndealing set forth in <em>Aranda v. Insurance Co. of North America</em>--that </span><span>FIE had no reasonable basis\r\nfor delaying payment of the benefits of the policy and </span><span>that it knew or should have known that it had\r\nno reasonable basis for delaying payment--the evidence would support the finding.  <em>See </em>748 S.W.2d\r\nat 213.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Because the court's charge specified that a finding of a breach of the duty of good\r\nfaith and fair dealing is sufficient to uphold the jury's award of actual damages</span><span>, </span><span>we affirm the actual\r\ndamages award in part, in the amount of $4,006,320.72, in addition to prejudgment and\r\npostjudgment interest as stated in the final judgment</span><span>.  This amount takes into account the reduction\r\nin the final judgment for the $2,045,204.28 that FIE had previously paid to Ballard, information that\r\nthe court's charge did not present to the jury.  Elsewhere in the opinion, we will discuss the $176,000\r\naward for Ballard's reasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>DTPA Violation, Unconscionability, and Fraud</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its second issue that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient\r\nto support the jury's findings that FIE engaged in deceptive trade practices, unconscionable conduct,\r\nand fraudulent conduct.  Ballard counters that FIE waived this argument because it did not properly\r\nbrief this issue. <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Because FIE's argument on this issue is grounded in\r\nits lengthy discussion that it did not breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing, we find that FIE\r\nsufficiently briefed this issue for the Court.  The jury found that FIE violated the DTPA by engaging\r\nin a false, misleading, or deceptive act or practice by (1) representing that services had or would have\r\ncharacteristics or benefits that they did not have, (2) representing that services are or will be of a\r\nparticular standard or quality when they were of another, (3) representing that an agreement confers\r\nor involves rights, remedies, or obligations that it did not have or involve, or (4) representing that\r\nwork or services have been performed, when the work or services were not performed.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nBus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 17.46(b)(5), (7), (12), (22) (West 2002).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard contends that the plumbing test letter was a misrepresentation about work\r\nperformed.  We agree that this is some evidence to support the jury's finding of a DTPA violation. \r\n</span><span>The jury may have reasonably concluded that McConnell's characterization of the test was a\r\nmisrepresentation</span><span> of work performed.  Additionally, the jury could have concluded from the\r\nevidence that Ballard's reliance on the plumbing test letter caused further damages to the house. \r\n</span><span>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, the evidence is legally sufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's finding that FIE committed a DTPA violation. Weighing all of the evidence, we\r\ncannot say that it is so weak as to be clearly wrong or manifestly unjust. <em>Cain</em>, 709 S.W.2d at 176. \r\n</span><span>We overrule this part of FIE's second issue and affirm the jury's finding that FIE committed a DTPA\r\nviolation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury also found that FIE engaged in an unconscionable action or course of action,\r\nwhich is \"an act or practice that, to a consumer's detriment, takes advantage of the lack of\r\nknowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair degree.\"  Tex. Bus.\r\n&amp; Com. Code Ann. § 17.45(5)(A) (West 2002).  \"Gross,\" as used in this section, means \"glaringly\r\nnoticeable, flagrant, complete and unmitigated.\"  <em>Nicolau</em>, 951 S.W.2d at 451.  Ballard's sole\r\ncontention in this regard is  that any misrepresentation by FIE equates with unconscionable conduct. \r\nThat is not the law. \"[N]ot every misrepresentation of fact, even an intentional one, constitutes\r\nunconscionable conduct.\"  <em>Latham v. Castillo</em>, 972 S.W.2d 66, 72 (Tex. 1998).  The test is whether\r\nthe consumer was taken advantage of to a grossly unfair degree.  <em>Id.  </em>The record does not provide\r\nsupport to satisfy this test.<em>  </em>Having reviewed the record, we find no evidence to support the finding\r\nthat FIE engaged in an unconscionable action or course of action.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury further found that FIE committed fraud against Ballard.  A </span><span>fraud cause of\r\naction requires: (1) a material misrepresentation, (2) that was either known to be false when made\r\nor was asserted without knowledge of its truth, (3) that was intended to be acted upon, (4) that was\r\nrelied upon, and (5) that caused injury.  <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis</em>, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). \r\nBallard makes no citation to the record to support her fraud claim, nor does she point to any actions\r\nthat might have been fraudulent.  In our review of the record, we find no evidence to support this\r\nclaim.  Having found sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of a DTPA violation, but no\r\nno evidence to support the jury's findings of unconscionability and  fraud, we overrule FIE's legal\r\nand factual sufficiency challenge to the DTPA violation finding and sustain FIE's challenges to the\r\nunconscionability and fraud findings.  Therefore, we </span><span>affirm the jury's finding that FIE committed\r\na DTPA violation</span><span>.  </span><span>The court's charge specified that a finding of a DTPA violation is sufficient to\r\nuphold the jury's award of actual damages.  Based on this finding, we affirm the actual damages in\r\nthe amount of $4,006,320.72, in addition to prejudgment and postjudgment interest as stated in the\r\nfinal judgment</span><span>.

American States Preferred Ins. Co.</em>, 919 S.W.2d 679, 683 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 1996, writ denied).  Every reasonable presumption will be indulged to sustain an\r\nappraisal decision.  <em>Providence Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Crystal City Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 877 S.W.2d 872,\r\n875 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1994, no writ).  An award may be set aside in three instances: when\r\nit was (1) made without authority; (2) the result of fraud, accident, or mistake; or (3) not made in\r\nsubstantial compliance with the terms of the contract. <em>Wells</em>, 919 S.W.2d at 683; <em>Providence Lloyds</em>,\r\n877 S.W.2d at 875-76.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard's homeowner's insurance policy, a standard form policy promulgated by the\r\nTexas Department of Insurance, contains an appraisal clause.  Under this clause, either party may\r\ninvoke an appraisal if the party disagrees about the value of a claim or claims.  Each party then hires\r\nits own appraiser.  If the two appraisers cannot agree on the value, they select an umpire, or a district\r\njudge will appoint one if the appraisers cannot agree on an umpire.  A decision signed by any two\r\nof the three is binding as to the value of the claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE invoked the appraisal provision on May 27, 1999, the day that the parties failed\r\nto reach a settlement at mediation.  FIE chose as its appraiser Peter de la Mora, a structural engineer\r\nwho had performed appraisals for FIE approximately four or five times.  Ballard chose an attorney\r\nas her appraiser, who had to resign a few months later because of trial obligations.  Both parties\r\nagreed that Michael Schless, a former county court at law judge, would be the umpire.  Ballard then\r\nchose another attorney, Mike Duffy, as her successor appraiser in November 1999.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOver the course of the next year, the appraisers gathered estimates for remediation\r\nand replacement of the Ballard house.  In November 2000, de la Mora, Duffy, and Schless worked\r\nfor four days to determine the appraisal decision.  They met at the Ballard house with various\r\nexperts, then de la Mora and Duffy discussed their proposals with Schless.  On November 16, 2000,\r\nthey issued an appraisal decision in the amount of $1,287,092.72, which took into account payments\r\nthat FIE had already made to Ballard.  Both appraisers and Schless signed the decision, but Duffy,\r\nBallard's appraiser, disputed the amount of the award.  Under the terms of the insurance policy, the\r\nappraisal decision was binding because two of the three agreed on the amount.  FIE then sent checks\r\nto Ballard's attorney for the amount of the appraisal decision.  De la Mora and Schless issued an\r\namendment to the appraisal decision on January 30, 2001, to reflect the intent of the decision to be\r\na \"comprehensive statement of the actual cash value to replace or remediate the structure of the\r\nresidence and the groundskeeper's house, the contents of the residence, and the alternative living\r\nexpenses, considering only those claims that were properly subject to the appraisal.\"  Duffy did not\r\nparticipate in the amendment because he no longer had authority to act on behalf of Ballard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe will first address FIE's preliminary issue that Ballard waived her right to\r\nchallenge de la Mora as FIE's appraiser because she did not raise the issue until after the appraisal\r\ndecision was made.  Having learned from de la Mora's deposition, taken soon before the appraisal\r\ndecision, that he had previously done work for FIE, Ballard contended in an amended petition that\r\nthe appraisal decision should be set aside.  She claimed that FIE breached the insurance contract by\r\nselecting an appraiser who was neither competent nor independent.  The effect of an </span><span></span><span>appraisal\r\ndecision is to </span><span></span><span>estop one party from contesting the issue of the value of damages in a suit on the\r\ninsurance contract.  <em>Hennessey v. Vanguard Ins. Co.</em>, 895 S.W.2d 794, 797-98 (Tex. App.--Amarillo\r\n1995, writ denied).  </span><span>As with other affirmative defenses, it is the defendant's burden to raise the issue\r\nof estoppel, Tex. R. Civ. P. 94, which FIE did in an amended answer.  Ballard has arguably waived\r\nany challenge because she did not oppose FIE's appraiser until after determination of the appraisal. \r\nWe will nevertheless address FIE's legal and factual sufficiency challenges to the jury's findings\r\nconcerning the appraisal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argues in a sub-issue concerning the appraisal that the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the finding that the appraisal decision was rendered as a result of\r\nfraud, accident,<sup> (7)</sup> or mistake.  In question seven of the charge, the jury was instructed that fraud means\r\nin part that a material misrepresentation was made and that the speaker made the misrepresentation\r\nwith the intent that the other party act on it.  Ballard contends that the jury had sufficient evidence\r\nto find fraud because the appraiser intentionally prevented Ballard from receiving like kind and\r\nquality replacement, failed to use available price and quality information, intentionally excluded\r\nitems from the appraisal process, and based his calculations on fraudulent bids from unqualified\r\ncontractors.  There is no evidence in the record to support these contentions.  For example, although\r\nBallard claims that de la Mora intentionally prevented her from receiving like kind and quality\r\nreplacement, de la Mora testified that he determined like kind and quality replacement costs during\r\nthe appraisal process.  One of the contractors who submitted a bid to de la Mora also testified that\r\nhe prepared his bid based on like kind and quality materials.  Despite the allegation, we find no\r\nevidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that the appraiser intentionally prevented Ballard\r\nfrom receiving like kind and quality replacement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence also does not show that anyone intentionally excluded items from the\r\nappraisal.  </span><span>At oral argument, Ballard contended that she wanted to submit \"everything\" in the\r\nappraisal but that FIE refused.  </span><span>Although Ballard made fourteen separate claims between December\r\n1998 and  August 1999, she had only submitted five claims by the time the appraisal process began\r\nin May 1999.  FIE's May 27, 1999 letter listed only three of those five claims, but de la Mora\r\ntestified that because the entire house had to be remediated, it did not matter which claim numbers\r\nwere included.  Additionally, the amendment to the appraisal decision</span><span> stated that the decision \"was\r\nintended to be a comprehensive statement\" of the cost to remediate or replace the house, its contents,\r\nand the groundskeeper's house, </span><span>plus additional living expenses.  There is no evidence that de la\r\nMora or FIE intended to exclude items from the appraisal.  Likewise, de la Mora's reliance on bids\r\nfrom contractors that he chose does not rise to the level of fraud.  Ballard opposed the bids because\r\nsome of the contractors had done previous work for FIE and because some of the contractors, such\r\nas the mold remediation company, had never submitted bids for work of this magnitude.  A lack of\r\nexperience does not equate with making material misrepresentations in a bid.  Given that mold\r\nclaims were still relatively novel in April 1999, when mold was discovered in Ballard's house,<sup> (8)</sup> it\r\nis not surprising that the contractors had little experience in the area of mold remediation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard objects to the bids solicited by de la Mora in part because she does not agree\r\nwith the valuation of the repair and replacement costs.  \"[A] finding of disparity, even gross\r\ndisparity, between an appraisal award and the cost of repair, cannot support a finding of bias or\r\npartiality without additional evidence.\"  <em>Hennessey</em>, 895 S.W.2d at 799.  Ballard fails to cite to any\r\nadditional evidence.  Based on our review of the record, we cannot find any evidence from which\r\na reasonable jury could infer that the appraisal decision was rendered as a result of fraud.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard argues that the appraisal decision was also rendered as a result of mistake\r\nbecause it listed \"alternative living expenses\" instead of \"additional living expenses\" for the costs\r\nof Ballard's family living away from their house.  The jury was instructed that \"mistake\" means a\r\nsituation in which the appraisers were operating under a mistake of fact such that their award does\r\nnot speak to their intention or that the error in the award is so great that it shows gross partiality,\r\nundue influence, or corruption.  Here, the \"mistake\" about which Ballard complains is similar to a\r\nclerical error.  De la Mora testified that the term \"alternative living expenses\" was intended to be the\r\nsame as \"additional living expenses\" and that the mere difference in wording did not affect the\r\nappraisal process.  A clerical error that does not affect the intention of the appraisers cannot support\r\na finding of mistake.  <em>See Providence Lloyds</em>, 877 S.W.2d at 878 (column labeled \"court award\"\r\ninstead of </span><span>\"agreed award\" did not constitute a mistake).  Based on our review of the record, we\r\ncannot find sufficient evidence to support a finding that the appraisal was rendered as a result of\r\nmistake.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's finding that the appraisal decision was the result of fraud, accident,\r\nor mistake.  Weighing all of the evidence, the evidence is also factually insufficient to support the\r\njury's finding that the appraisal decision was the result of fraud, accident, or mistake.  We therefore\r\nsustain FIE's sub-issue, reverse the jury's finding, and render judgment on this finding in favor of\r\nFIE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its second sub-issue concerning the appraisal that the evidence is\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the finding that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser.  We agree.  Ballard attempted to prove lack of independence because de la\r\nMora had a pre-existing business relationship with FIE.  However, Ballard presented no evidence\r\nthat FIE influenced or exercised control over de la Mora.  There is no evidence that de la Mora ever\r\nwas an employee of FIE or had a financial interest in the claims.  Instead, Ballard's evidence shows\r\nan arm's-length business relationship between FIE and de la Mora, which was fully disclosed before\r\nthe appraisal decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard presented evidence that:  de la Mora's company performed twenty to twenty-five percent of its work for FIE and eighty percent of its work overall for insurance companies; de\r\nla Mora had performed four or five appraisals for FIE before the Ballard appraisal; and that de la\r\nMora had worked with FIE's attorney ten times since 1996.  The showing of a pre-existing\r\nrelationship, without more, does not support a finding of lack of independence. <em> Gardner v. State\r\nFarm Lloyds</em>, 76 S.W.3d 140, 143 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.).  De la Mora has\r\nnever been an employee of FIE.  Further, FIE instructed de la Mora to determine costs on his own,\r\nnot from any figures that FIE provided.  FIE never told him how to estimate the costs.  He had no\r\nrestriction on receiving assistance from outside experts.  As an independent contractor, de la Mora\r\namply demonstrated that despite his previous business dealings with FIE, he exercised independent\r\njudgment in the appraisal process; Ballard has directed us to no evidence to the contrary, and we\r\ncannot find any support for her position in the record.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard attempted to prove lack of competence on the ground that de la Mora had no\r\nexperience with molds or mold remediation.  The evidence shows, however, that de la Mora was\r\ncompetent as an appraiser.  He has a degree in civil engineering, is a registered professional engineer,\r\nhas thirty-three years of experience in structural engineering, and has built hundreds of houses,\r\nincluding houses comparable to the Ballard house.  Because he had no experience with mold\r\nremediation, he retained mold experts to assist him with the remediation estimate.  This was no\r\ndifferent than Ballard's appraiser, an attorney, retaining mold experts to assist him with his\r\nestimates.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, we conclude that the\r\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser.  Weighing all of the evidence, the evidence is also factually insufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's finding that FIE failed to appoint a competent, independent appraiser.  We\r\ntherefore sustain FIE's sub-issue, reverse the jury's finding, and render judgment on this finding in\r\nfavor of FIE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we conclude that the appraisal was not rendered as a result of fraud, accident,\r\nor mistake and that the appraiser was competent and independent, the appraisal decision is binding\r\nand enforceable.  <em>Wells</em>, 919 S.W.2d at 683.  We thus sustain FIE's third issue.  Under the terms of\r\nthe insurance contract, each party must pay its own appraiser and bear the other expenses of the\r\nappraisal and umpire equally.  Therefore, we reverse the jury's award of $176,000 to Ballard for her\r\nreasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process and render that Ballard take nothing on this\r\nclaim.  Given, however, that Ballard's claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is\r\nstatutorily based and extra-contractual, outside of the bounds of the appraisal decision, Ballard's\r\ndamages are not limited to the amount of the appraisal decision.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Knowing Violation</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its seventh issue, FIE challenges the legal sufficiency of the jury's finding that FIE\r\nknowingly engaged in deceptive acts or practices toward Ballard, contending that there is no\r\nevidence to support this finding.  We agree.  \"Knowingly,\" as the district court correctly charged the\r\njury, is the \"actual awareness of the falsity, unfairness, or deception of the conduct in question.\" \r\nTex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 17.45(9) (West 2002).  \"[A]ctual awareness may be inferred where\r\nobjective manifestations indicate that a person acted with actual awareness.\"  <em>Id.</em>  \"Actual awareness\"\r\ndoes not mean merely that a person knows what he is doing; rather, it means that a person knows that\r\nwhat he is doing is false, deceptive, or unfair.  In other words, a person must think at some point,\r\n\"Yes, I know this is false, deceptive, or unfair to [the other person], but I'm going to do it anyway.\"<em> \r\nSt. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Dal-Worth Tank Co.,</em> 974 </span><span></span><span>S.W.2d 51, 53-54 (Tex. 1998).<em>  </em>Actual\r\nawareness is more than conscious indifference toward another's rights or welfare.  <em>Id.</em> at 54.  We\r\nmust affirm the jury's finding if we find more than a scintilla of evidence that FIE's conduct fit\r\nwithin the definition of \"knowingly.\"  <em>See Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye</em>, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499\r\n(Tex. 1995).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is some evidence from which the jury could have found that FIE breached its\r\nduty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard, but there is no evidence in the record that FIE was\r\nactually aware that its actions toward Ballard were false, deceptive, or unfair--that is, that FIE was\r\nmore than consciously indifferent to Ballard's rights and welfare.  Under the <em>St. Paul Surplus </em>test,\r\nrelied upon by both parties, we must find that someone with FIE must have had a subjective\r\nawareness of the falsity, deception, or unfairness before FIE may be held to have acted knowingly. \r\nBallard admits that a single act does not rise to the level of knowing conduct and without citation\r\nto the record  tries to paint a \"knowing\" picture from the pattern of acts relied upon for her lack of\r\ngood faith and fair dealing claim.  Ballard contends, for example, that McConnell's plumbing test\r\nletter was a knowing misrepresentation.  McConnell based this statement on information that she\r\nreceived from the plumbing company, and we cannot say this is evidence from which a reasonable\r\njury could infer that McConnell made a knowing misrepresentation.  She had no conversation with\r\nBallard about the plumbing test, instead simply forwarding information after she received the report\r\nfrom the plumbing company.  Additionally, FIE relied on the statement that \"complete plumbing\r\ntests\" were made as much as Ballard did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard further argues that FIE knowingly refused to pay an estimate from one of its\r\nbidders.  Ballard makes no citation to the record for this contention, and we cannot find any support\r\nfor it in our review of the record.  Ballard next contends that FIE \"intentionally withheld\" approved\r\nclaim funds to gain leverage to settle all matters in controversy.  We disagree.  Although the first\r\npayment for the hardwood floor damage may have taken longer than necessary, FIE did pay all but\r\none of Ballard's claims, both before and after she filed suit against FIE.  The record does not contain\r\nevidence that FIE knowingly withheld claim payments to gain leverage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard also argues that FIE intentionally made payments based on sham and\r\nfraudulent bids from contractors who refused to perform work for the amount of the bids and who\r\nwere retained as FIE's experts.  Although \"sham and fraudulent bids\" was one of Ballard's themes\r\nduring the trial, we cannot find any evidence to support this theme.  FIE obtained bids from many\r\ncontractors during the course of handling the claims and paid the claims according to its own\r\nvaluation, assisted by the bids.  Ballard also attempted to show that FIE based its payments on\r\nexpired bids, because two companies that had made bids would not do the work for Ballard at the\r\nprices they had quoted to FIE.  They in fact would not do the work because they had been retained\r\nas FIE's expert witnesses by that time.  Both Ballard and FIE hired contractors involved in the claims\r\nas its experts in the trial, which is not itself unreasonable because they were familiar with the damage\r\nto the Ballard home.  The record does not contain evidence that any of FIE's conduct concerning its\r\nbids from contractors was knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard next argues that FIE improperly invoked the appraisal provision to gain\r\nleverage against her.  FIE had a right to invoke the appraisal provision under the terms of the\r\nhomeowner's insurance policy and did so when mediation attempts failed.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Gardner</em>, 76\r\nS.W.3d at 142.  There is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could infer that this\r\nconduct was knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair.  Nor was the appointment of an appraiser with\r\na previous business relationship with FIE evidence of knowing conduct.  A previous business\r\nrelationship, standing alone, is not probative of knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair conduct.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nat 143.  De la Mora disclosed his relationship with FIE in his deposition, taken before the appraisal\r\ndecision was issued.  Ballard did not object to de la Mora until <em>after</em> receiving that decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Ballard argues that FIE intentionally withheld estimates and information from\r\nde la Mora.  De la Mora testified, however, that FIE told him that he had to arrive at his own\r\nestimates, independent of anything that FIE had.  FIE did so because the insurance policy required\r\nthat de la Mora be independent.  Complying with the terms of the insurance policy is no evidence\r\nof knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair conduct.  The only evidence that might support a finding of\r\nknowing conduct, which Ballard did not raise with regard to this issue, is that McConnell made a\r\nmisrepresentation to Ballard that she needed more time to evaluate the claim, when in fact she\r\nneeded time to obtain authority from her supervisors to pay the claim.  Although McConnell\r\nadmitted at trial that she needed more time to gain authority, not to investigate, we cannot say that\r\nthis was part of a pattern of knowing conduct or that this conduct resulted in damages to Ballard. \r\nIt merely delayed payment of the first claim by less than three weeks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn examining the finding that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing, we\r\nfocused on whether FIE acted reasonably in handling Ballard's claims.  <em>See Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 56;\r\n<em>Lyons</em>, 866 S.W.2d at 601.  The test for finding knowing conduct, enunciated in <em>St. Paul</em> <em>Surplus</em>,\r\nis much more stringent:  we must find some evidence in the record that someone with FIE must have\r\nhad a subjective awareness of the falsity, deception, or unfairness.  <em>See Connell Chevrolet Co. v.\r\nLeak</em>, 967 S.W.2d 888, 893 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, no pet.).  None of the evidence to which\r\nBallard points demonstrates such a subjective awareness.  Because the record contains no evidence\r\nthat FIE engaged in  knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair conduct, we sustain FIE's seventh issue\r\nchallenging the legal sufficiency of this finding.  <em>See Croucher</em>, 660 S.W.2d at 58.  Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the jury's finding and render judgment on this issue in favor of FIE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury awarded punitive damages and mental anguish damages based on conduct\r\ncommitted \"knowingly or fraudulently.\"  Under the insurance code, a party may recover punitive\r\ndamages and mental anguish damages only if the jury finds that the violation was committed\r\nknowingly.  Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21, § 16(b)(1) (West Supp. 2003) (concerning punitive\r\ndamages); <em>State Farm Life Ins. Co. v. Beaston</em>, 907 S.W.2d 430, 435-36 (Tex. 1995) (concerning\r\nmental anguish damages).  The DTPA also requires a knowing finding to recover these damages. \r\nTex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(b)(1) (West 2002); <em>Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Low</em>, 79 S.W.3d\r\n561, 566 (Tex. 2002);<em> see also </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

We therefore need not address FIE's eighth and ninth issues\r\nthat the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support these findings. </span><span> We render judgment\r\nthat Ballard take nothing on her claims for punitive damages and mental anguish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>No-Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment on Concurrent Causation</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argues in its sixth issue that the district court erred in granting Ballard's no-evidence motion for summary judgment on concurrent causation.  We will apply the general\r\nstandards for reviewing a grant of a no-evidence motion for summary judgment.<em>  See, e.g.</em>,</span><span>\r\n<em>Holmstrom</em>, 26 S.W.3d at 530.</span><span>  Because the district court's order does not specify the ground or\r\ngrounds relied on for its ruling, we will affirm the summary judgment if any of the theories </span><span></span><span>Ballard\r\nadvanced are meritorious.  <em>See Carr</em>, 776 S.W.2d at 569.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE asserted in its second amended answer that Ballard had the burden of segregating\r\ndamages among covered and non-covered losses, under the doctrine of concurrent causation.  Under\r\nthis doctrine, when covered and non-covered perils combine to create a loss, the insured is entitled\r\nto recover only that portion of the damage caused solely by the covered peril. <em>Travelers Indem. Co.\r\nv. McKillip</em>, 469 S.W.2d 160, 162 (Tex. 1971);<em> Wallis v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n</em>, 2 S.W.3d 300,\r\n302-03 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1999, pet. denied).  The doctrine of concurrent causation is not\r\nan affirmative defense or an avoidance issue; rather, it is a rule embodying the basic principle that\r\ninsureds are not entitled to recover under their insurance policies unless they prove that their damage\r\nis covered by the policy.  <em>Wallis</em>, 2 S.W.3d<em> </em>at 303.  Thus, an insured may only recover for the amount\r\nof damage caused solely by the covered peril.  <em>Id.</em>  The burden is on the insured to prove coverage. \r\n<em>Id. </em> The insured must therefore present some evidence upon which the jury can allocate the damages\r\nattributable to the covered peril.  <em>Id. </em> Because allocation is central to the claim for coverage, an\r\ninsured's failure to carry the burden of proof on allocation is fatal to the claim. <em> Id.</em>  The insured must\r\nattempt to segregate the loss caused by the covered peril from the loss caused by the excluded peril. \r\n<em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe doctrine of concurrent causation is inapplicable in this case for two reasons. \r\nFirst, FIE never denied any claim at issue in this appeal on the ground that the claim was a non-covered peril.  Second, FIE asserted the doctrine of concurrent causation pursuant to article 21.58(b)\r\nof the insurance code, which states that \"[i]n any suit to recover under a contract of insurance, the\r\ninsurer has the burden of proof as to any avoidance or affirmative defense that must be affirmatively\r\npleaded under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.58(b) (West Supp.\r\n2003).  All of Ballard's claims presented to the jury were extra-contractual, beyond recovery under\r\nthe contract of insurance.  Therefore, we overrule FIE's sixth point of error and affirm the district\r\ncourt's ruling granting Ballard's no-evidence summary judgment on concurrent causation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong><em>District Court's Evidentiary Rulings</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its fifth issue that the district court abused its discretion and deprived\r\nFIE of a fair trial by excluding evidence of settlement offers made during mediation, some instances\r\nof Ballard's conduct toward FIE's adjusters, and de la Mora's testimony that Ballard's lawyers\r\ndelayed the appraisal process.  FIE further argues that the district court abused its discretion by\r\nallowing evidence about the possible health effects of mycotoxins from molds.  We apply an abuse\r\nof discretion standard to the question of whether a district court erred in an evidentiary ruling. <em>\r\nNational Liab. &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. Allen</em>, 15 S.W.3d 525, 527-28 (Tex. 2000); <em>City of Brownsville v.\r\nAlvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995). We may reverse a district court under this standard only\r\nwhen we find that \"the court acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner,\" <em>Beaumont Bank, N.A.\r\nv. Buller</em>, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991), or \"without regard for any guiding rules or principles.\"\r\n<em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone</em>, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998) (quoting <em>Alvarado</em></span><span>, 897\r\nS.W.2d at 754).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen seeking to reverse a judgment based on an improper evidentiary ruling, a\r\ncomplaining party \"need not prove that but for the error a different judgment would necessarily have\r\nbeen rendered, but only that the error probably resulted in an improper judgment.\"  </span><span><em>Alvarado</em>, 897\r\nS.W.2d at 753; <em>accord</em> <em>Malone</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 43. To prevail, the party must demonstrate that \"the\r\njudgment turns on the particular evidence excluded or admitted.\" <em> Alvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d<em> </em>at 753-54.\r\nWe review the entire record to determine whether a party has met this burden.  <em>Id.</em> at 754.  If any\r\nlegitimate basis exists to support a district court's evidentiary ruling, then we must uphold the court's\r\ndecision.  <em>Malone</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 43;<em> State Bar v. Evans</em>, 774 S.W.2d 656, 658 n.5 (Tex. 1989)\r\n(citing <em>McCormick on Evidence</em> § 52, at 131 (3d ed. 1984)).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argues that its offer of $734,000 at mediation and Ballard's demand of no less\r\nthan $10 million plus media rights should be admissible to show that FIE attempted to settle in good\r\nfaith and to counter the implication that FIE could have settled in May 1999.  Discussions in\r\nalternative dispute resolution proceedings are generally confidential and inadmissible as evidence\r\nagainst a participant in any judicial proceeding.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 154.073(a)\r\n(West Supp. 2003).  Evidence of conduct made in settlement negotiations can be admissible if\r\noffered for a purpose other than to show liability, such as \"negativing a contention of undue delay.\" \r\nTex. R. Evid. 408.  However, as the district court stated, a \"cloak of confidentiality\" surrounds\r\nmediation, and the cloak should be breached only sparingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE cites <em>Avary v. Bank of America, N.A.</em> for the proposition that it should have been\r\nable to disclose evidence of Ballard's conduct during the mediation.  72 S.W.3d 779 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 2002, pet. denied).  <em>Avary</em> is distinguishable:  it concerned a bank's breach of fiduciary\r\nduty in rejecting a higher settlement offer during mediation.  The court allowed evidence of the\r\nbank's conduct during mediation because it went to the heart of the parties' dispute.  <em>Id.</em> at 796. \r\nHere, the district court excluded this evidence primarily because FIE's conduct was at issue, not\r\nBallard's.  <em>See</em> Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21, § 4(10)(a)(ii) (conduct in question is whether <em>insurer</em>\r\n\"fail[ed] to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim with\r\nrespect to which the insurer's liability has become reasonably clear\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE's reliance on two other cases allowing evidence of settlement negotiations is also\r\nmisplaced.  <em>See U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Millard</em>, 847 S.W.2d 668 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.]\r\n1993, orig. proceeding); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</em> <em>v. Wilborn</em>, 835 S.W.2d 260 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding).  In both cases, because the entire basis of the\r\nclaim was the amount of the insurance company's settlement offer, it was necessary for the court to\r\nadmit settlement negotiation evidence.  Here, although the district court could have admitted\r\nevidence of Ballard's demands at mediation for the purpose of countering her contention that FIE\r\nunduly delayed in paying her claims, <em>see</em> Tex. R. Evid. 408, he excluded the evidence because of the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice and because of the general rule that settlement discussions are\r\nconfidential.  In light of the standard of review, we decline to breach the \"cloak of confidentiality\"\r\nthat exists to encourage settlement discussions.  <em>See Wilborn</em>, 835 S.W.2d at 261.  Accordingly, we\r\nhold that the district court did not act in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner or without regard for\r\nany guiding rules or principles in excluding evidence of settlement offers made during mediation. \r\n<em>Beaumont Bank</em>, 806 S.W.2d at 226.  Further, FIE has failed to show how the exclusion of this\r\nevidence led to the rendition of an improper judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding certain\r\nevidence of Ballard's interaction with FIE's adjusters.  FIE asserts that the jury could not properly\r\ndetermine whether FIE acted reasonably without hearing evidence of Ballard's conduct, which FIE\r\nalleges obstructed FIE's efforts to adjust her claims, caused delay, and generally defeated FIE's\r\nattempts to settle.  Evidence that FIE attempted to admit included Ballard's threats to use her $44\r\nmillion trust fund to fight FIE and to snort <em>stachybotrys</em> if necessary to hurt FIE.  The district court\r\nexcluded the character evidence after balancing what he termed the \"extremely, extremely limited\r\nprobative value\" of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and\r\nmisleading the jury.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Evid. 403, 404.  Further, he specifically excluded the evidence\r\nabout Ballard's wealth because courts \"try to keep those kinds of tawdry considerations out of the\r\nfact-finding process.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough other evidence of Ballard's conduct may have added coloratura to the trial,\r\nthere was ample evidence before the jury showing the flavor of Ballard's conduct.  For example, the\r\njury saw dozens of letters that Ballard sent to FIE throughout the claims-handling process.  As early\r\nas mid-January 1999, Ballard complained in a letter to McConnell about \"your 'experts' traipsing\r\nin and out of my house.\"  In a March 8, 1999, letter to McConnell, Ballard wrote, \"I hope you take\r\ngreat comfort knowing while you are out trying to manipulate the facts and throw an inadequate sum\r\nof money at me that doesn't get me to first base, my family is living in a house that clearly is\r\ndangerous.\"  She ended her letter with, \"You should be ashamed.\"  After moving out of the house,\r\nshe demanded that FIE pay for accommodations at the expensive Four Seasons Hotel in Austin as\r\n\"the only thing I've found suitable.\"  These letters and many others more than adequately conveyed\r\nthe flavor of Ballard's contentious stance toward FIE, which began within weeks of her filing the\r\nDecember 17, 1998 claim.  Additionally, the jury heard evidence that Ballard changed both lawyers\r\nand appraisers during the claims-handling and litigation process, which it could have inferred as a\r\ncontribution to delays.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile the jury did not get to see the full picture of Ballard's conduct, we believe that\r\nit saw enough of the picture to evaluate whether her conduct hampered FIE's efforts.  Accordingly,\r\nwe hold that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in excluding certain evidence\r\nof Ballard's interaction with FIE's adjusters.  More importantly, FIE failed to demonstrate  how the\r\nexclusion of this evidence led to the rendition of an improper judgment</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE further asserts that the district court erred in excluding testimony by de la Mora\r\nthat Ballard \"obstructed and delayed\" the appraisal process.  FIE argues that by excluding this\r\ntestimony, the </span><span>\"court permitted Ballard to profit from the false impression that [FIE] delayed the\r\nprocess.\"  The jury heard evidence that the appraisal process began in May 1999 and did not\r\nconclude until November 2000.  But it heard no evidence about why the process took so long\r\nbecause the judge granted Ballard's motion in limine that no mention be made of Ballard or her\r\nappraiser delaying the appraisal process.  The district court's practice of allowing jurors to question\r\nwitnesses at the end of their testimony resulted in the district court posing the following question to\r\nde la Mora:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT:\tWhy did the appraisal process take 18 months?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE WITNESS:\tThe appraisal process took 18 months because the Ballard\r\nattorneys kept keeping us from going to the house to do the work\r\nthat we needed to do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The district court then excused the jury, reprimanded de la Mora, and warned that he would be in\r\ncontempt of court if he \"advocated\" for FIE again.  The jury returned, and the district court requested\r\nthat they disregard de la Mora's answer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor the same reasons as discussed concerning Ballard's conduct toward FIE, we\r\nconclude that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in excluding evidence of\r\nBallard's conduct purportedly delaying the appraisal process and that FIE has failed to show how\r\nthe exclusion of this evidence led to the rendition of an improper judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its last contention that the district court abused its discretion, FIE argues that the\r\ndistrict court should not have allowed admission of evidence that mycotoxins from molds can cause\r\nserious personal injury.  FIE urges that the district court should have excluded all evidence in this\r\narea because it granted FIE's motion to exclude Allison's causation experts, who would have\r\ntestified about the health effects of exposure to the mycotoxins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAmong the few references to the health effects is that one of the mycotoxins is a\r\nknown liver carcinogen and, in a letter from Ballard put into evidence by <em>FIE</em>, that one of the Ballard\r\npets had a \"terrible skin problem caused by <em>Stachybotrys</em> exposure.\"  The district court, after careful\r\ndeliberation, allowed this evidence because it was relevant to Ballard's mental anguish claim, not\r\nfor her own fear of getting ill but her concern for her family.<sup> (9)</sup></span><span> The district court put a further\r\nsafeguard in place by twice instructing the jury that personal injury claims were not part of the case. \r\nThe general rule is that an instruction to disregard a subject not part of the case will cure error.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>, <em>Fowler v. Garcia</em>, 687 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1985, no writ).  We therefore\r\nhold</span><span> that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in allowing evidence of the health\r\neffects of mycotoxins and that FIE has failed to show how the admission of this evidence led to the\r\nrendition of an improper judgment.  Having found no abuse of discretion in the district court's\r\nevidentiary rulings of which FIE complains, we overrule FIE's fifth issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Attorneys' Fees</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its tenth issue that there is insufficient evidence of reasonable and\r\nnecessary attorneys' fees and thus that we should reverse the jury's award of $8.9 million in fees to\r\nBallard's attorneys.  </span><span>A plaintiff who prevails in a DTPA cause of action \"shall be awarded court\r\ncosts and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees.\"  Tex.

City of Arlington,</em></span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span> 711 S.W.2d 232, 233 (Tex. 1986)<span>.

Perry Equip. Corp.</em>, 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997) (citing Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof.\r\nConduct 1.04, <em>reprinted in</em> Tex. Govt. Code Ann., tit. 2, subtit. G app. A (West 1998) (Tex. State\r\nBar R. art. X, § 9)).  The fact finder should consider a contingent fee agreement, but \"the plaintiff\r\ncannot simply ask the jury to award a percentage of the recovery as a fee because without evidence\r\nof the factors identified in rule 1.04, the jury has no meaningful way to determine if the fees were\r\nin fact reasonable and necessary.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 818-19.  The plaintiff must ask the jury to award fees in a\r\nspecific dollar amount, not as a percentage of recovery.  <em>Id. </em>at 819.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tHere, the jury heard evidence of the above factors from Ballard's attorneys' fees\r\nexpert, Richard Cedillo.  He discussed all eight factors from rule 1.04, including the quality of the\r\nattorneys on the case and the time required.  He stated that a contingent fee contract of thirty-five\r\npercent on the first eight million and forty percent on any award above that amount was fair.  FIE\r\ncontends that the evidence is insufficient partly because Ballard's attorneys did not submit hourly\r\ntime sheets.  Cedillo testified, based on his experience on complex cases and review of the Ballard\r\nfile, that Ballard's attorneys spent a great deal of time on her case because of the paper, motions,\r\npreparation for seventy depositions, trial preparation, and complex issues involved.  He further\r\nexplained that Ballard's attorneys did not keep hourly time sheets because they were under a\r\ncontingent fee contract, not an agreement based on an hourly fee.  Thus, Ballard would not expect\r\nstatements about their time on the case.  Having heard Cedillo's testimony, the jury awarded fees in\r\na specific dollar amount, as requested in the charge.  Cedillo's coverage of the factors stated in\r\n<em>Arthur Andersen</em>, including the suggestion that the dollar amount be based on the contingent fee,<em> </em>are\r\nsufficient evidence to support the award of attorneys' fees.  <em>See Vingcard A.S. v. Merrimac\r\nHospitality Sys., Inc</em>., 59 S.W.3d 847, 870 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2001, pet. denied) (jury award\r\nof dollar amount based on contingent fee, after hearing testimony of the rule 1.04 factors, met the\r\n<em>Arthur Andersen</em> requirements).  Accordingly, we overrule FIE's tenth issue and hold that there was\r\nlegally sufficient evidence of reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tWe cannot say, however, that the award of $8.9 million is still reasonable, given that\r\nwe have significantly reduced the damages awarded by the jury.  We remand the determination of\r\nattorneys' fees to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span>Article 21.55 Damages</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tFIE asserts in its eleventh issue that there was no basis for awarding or calculating\r\nany interest penalty under article 21.55 of the insurance code.  The purpose of article 21.55 is to\r\nobtain prompt payment of claims pursuant to policies of insurance, and its provisions are to be\r\nliberally construed to promote this purpose. </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><em><span>See</span></em></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span></span></span><span>Tex. Ins. Code Ann art. 21.55, <span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span>§ </span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span>8<span> (West Supp.\r\n2003).  Article 21.55 provides that \"if an insurer delays payment of a claim following its receipt of\r\nall items, statements, and forms reasonably requested and required . . . for more than 60 days, the\r\ninsurer shall pay damages and other items as provided for in Section 6 of this article.\"  Tex. Ins.\r\nCode art. 21.55, § 3(f).  Section six provides for eighteen percent annual interest on the amount of\r\nthe delayed payment, together with reasonable attorneys' fees.  <em>Id.</em> § 6.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tFIE argues that there was no basis for the 21.55 penalty because Ballard did not prove\r\nor obtain jury findings that FIE violated the article.  As discussed above, we have found some\r\nevidence to support the jury finding that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing in\r\n\"[f]ailing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim\r\nwhen the insurer's liability has become reasonably clear.\"  Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21,\r\n§ 4(10)(a)(ii).  McConnell unequivocally testified that FIE had all of the information that it needed\r\nto pay the costs of remediation by May 17, 1999.  FIE did not pay any of those costs until August\r\n30, 1999, more than sixty days later.  Therefore, FIE subjected itself to the provisions of article\r\n21.55.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\t</span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span>But the record demonstrates that FIE did not cause all of the delay.  Ballard rejected\r\nFIE's August 30, 1999 payments of $382,738.69 on the ground that they were based on invalid bids,\r\nbut then accepted checks for the same amounts on February 17, 2000.  We find, therefore, that the\r\ndistrict court erred in calculating eighteen percent interest </span><span><span> </span></span><span>on $382,738.69 between August 30, 1999\r\nand February 17, 2000, because Ballard caused that delay in payment.  </span><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><span></span>Otherwise, we find that the\r\nevidence supports the district court's calculations of the eighteen percent penalty, based on evidence\r\nthat FIE delayed full payment of Ballard's claims for more than sixty days.  Accordingly, we remand\r\nthe statutory penalty issue to the district court for recalculation in accordance with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we find no error in the district court's rulings concerning Allison's claims,\r\nwe affirm the rulings of the district court in granting FIE's motion to exclude his causation experts\r\nand FIE's no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment pertaining to Allison's personal injury\r\nclaims.  </span><span>Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment dismissing Allison's personal injury\r\nclaims.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold that probative evidence supports the district court's denial of FIE's motion\r\nto transfer venue to Hays County.  We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in the evidentiary rulings of which FIE complains.  We also find sufficient evidence to\r\nuphold the jury's findings that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard\r\nand that FIE committed a DTPA violation.  After a thorough review of the evidence in the record,\r\nand with deference to the province of the jury, we hold that the evidence is both legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to uphold the jury's verdict on several other grounds of recovery.  We find insufficient\r\nevidence to support the jury's findings of unconscionability or fraud.  We additionally find\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser or that the appraisal decision was a result of fraud, accident, or mistake. \r\nBecause the court's charge specified that findings of either a breach of the duty of good faith and fair\r\ndealing or a DTPA violation are sufficient to uphold the jury's award of actual damages, we affirm\r\nthe actual damages award in part, in the amount of </span><span>$4,006,320.72, in addition to prejudgment and\r\npostjudgment interest as stated in the final judgment.  We reverse</span><span> the award of $176,000 for\r\nBallard's reasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe further conclude that there is no evidence to support the jury's finding that FIE\r\n\"knowingly\" breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard.  Because a finding of\r\na knowing violation is required to uphold punitive and mental anguish damages, we reverse the\r\njury's awards for these damages and render judgment that Ballard take nothing for punitive and\r\nmental anguish damages.  </span><span>We uphold the district court's award of the article 21.55 statutory penalty\r\nin part and </span><span><span></span></span><span>remand the penalty for recalculation in accordance with this opinion</span><span><span></span></span><span>.  </span><span>We find sufficient\r\nevidence to support the award of attorneys' fees but cannot say that the amount of the award is\r\nreasonable, given our significant reduction of the jury's damages awards.  Therefore, we remand the\r\nissue of attorneys' fees to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\tJan P.

DIETZ, JUDGE PRESIDING</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong><hr>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span></span>\tIn June 2001, a Travis County jury awarded a verdict for over thirty-two million\r\ndollars against Fire Insurance Exchange, a member of the Farmers Insurance Group (\"FIE\"), for its\r\nhandling of Mary Melinda Ballard's<sup> (1)</sup> homeowner's insurance claims, which began as a single claim\r\nfor water damage to a hardwood floor and evolved to include mold contamination of the entire house\r\nand outbuildings.  FIE contends in eleven issues on appeal that the evidence was legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's liability findings; the district court erred in denying transfer of\r\nvenue to Hays County; the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's\r\nfindings that FIE failed to appoint a competent, independent appraiser and that the appraisal decision\r\nwas rendered as a result of fraud, accident, or mistake; the district court abused its discretion in\r\nnumerous evidentiary rulings; there was no evidence of a knowing violation; the punitive damages\r\naward is excessive; there was no evidence to support the mental anguish award; there was\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the attorneys' fees award; and there was no basis for the statutory\r\npenalty under article 21.55 of the insurance code.  <span><em>See </em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.55, § 6 (West\r\nSupp. 2003).</span>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe recognize the constraints on this Court in its review of this hotly disputed case \r\nand the importance of according the proper degree of deference to the fact finder.  We have carefully\r\nreviewed the entire record.  We hew to the record below despite the metamorphosis of the parties'\r\ntheories on appeal.  We hold that probative evidence supports the district court's denial of FIE's\r\nmotion to transfer venue to Hays County.  We further conclude that the district court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in the evidentiary rulings of which FIE complains.  We also find sufficient evidence\r\nto uphold the jury's findings that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard\r\nand that FIE committed a Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) violation.  We find insufficient\r\nevidence, however, to support the jury's findings of unconscionability or fraud.  We additionally find\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser or that the appraisal decision was a result of fraud, accident, or mistake. \r\n</span><span>Because the court's charge specified that findings of either a breach of the duty of good faith and fair\r\ndealing or a DTPA violation are sufficient to uphold the jury's award of actual damages, we affirm\r\nthe actual damages award in part, in the amount of </span><span>$4,006,320.72, in addition to prejudgment and\r\npostjudgment interest as stated in the final judgment.  We reverse<span></span> the award of $176,000 for\r\nBallard's reasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe further conclude that there is no evidence to support the jury's finding that FIE\r\n\"knowingly\" breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard.  Because a finding of\r\na knowing violation is required to uphold punitive and mental anguish damages, we reverse the\r\njury's awards for these damages and render judgment that Ballard take nothing for punitive and\r\nmental anguish damages.  We uphold the district court's award of the article 21.55 statutory penalty\r\nin part and remand the penalty for recalculation in accordance with this opinion.  We find sufficient\r\nevidence to support the award of attorneys' fees but cannot say that the amount of the award is\r\nreasonable, given our significant reduction of the jury's damages awards.  Therefore, we remand the\r\nissue of attorneys' fees to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRonald Allison, Ballard's husband, filed a separate appeal, contending that the district\r\ncourt erred in granting FIE's motion to exclude Allison's causation experts and in turn granting FIE's\r\nno-evidence motion for partial summary judgment pertaining to Allison's personal injury claims. \r\nBecause we find no error in the district court's rulings, we affirm the district court's rulings in\r\ngranting FIE's motion to exclude his causation experts and no-evidence motion for partial summary\r\njudgment pertaining to Allison's personal injury claims.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\r\njudgment dismissing Allison's personal injury claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1990, Ballard bought a large house in Dripping Springs, Texas, for $275,000 in\r\na foreclosure sale.  The main house was approximately 7,400 square feet, with several outbuildings,\r\nincluding a nanny's apartment (also referred to as the groundskeeper's house), a garage, and a barn. \r\nIn late 1992, Ballard began insuring the house with FIE.  The amount of coverage remained steady\r\nover the next few years, except for cost-of-living adjustments.  The coverage in late 1998 was\r\n$313,000 for the house and $187,800 for the contents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWithin a couple of years before the claims at issue, which began in December 1998,\r\nthe Ballard house had a few plumbing leaks.  In 1996 and 1997, Ballard filed two claims for\r\nplumbing leaks caused by frozen pipes; FIE paid $60,000 to $70,000 for the 1997 claim.  She did\r\nnot make another claim until December 1998 but continued to have plumbing leaks.  In late 1997,\r\nBallard had a toilet leak repaired in the downstairs half bathroom, which required another repair in\r\nJanuary 1998.  The leak caused damage to the bathroom carpet pad and wood subflooring, both of\r\nwhich were replaced in February 1998.  The same month, Ballard notified Richard Roberts of\r\nDouble R Floors that some of the boards in the downstairs hardwood floor were warping.  Roberts\r\ntook a moisture reading in the area of warping, which read nineteen to twenty percent.  The normal\r\nmoisture content of hardwood floors is around twelve percent.  He then replaced some of the boards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe plumber returned a third time to repair the half bath toilet leak in July 1998.  In\r\nAugust 1998, Ballard notified Roberts of more hardwood floor warping and buckling.  He took\r\nanother moisture measurement, which was seventeen to eighteen percent, then replaced more boards. \r\nIn October 1998, Ballard called Roberts again to report more hardwood floor damage.  The moisture\r\nmeasurement was fifteen to sixteen percent, and Roberts replaced more boards.  Roberts examined\r\nthe floor again in December 1998 and took a moisture reading of fourteen to fifteen percent.  At that\r\ntime, Roberts said that the damage was too extensive to do any more spot repairs.  He recommended\r\nthat Ballard file a claim under her homeowner's insurance policy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 17, 1998, Ballard filed a claim with FIE for the water damage to the\r\nhardwood floor.  An outside adjuster inspected the floor on December 22 and at first opined that the\r\ndamage was caused by foundation settling, which is not covered under the homeowner's policy. \r\nAfter seeing two areas of water damage, he reconsidered and requested plumbing tests.  The claim\r\nwas assigned to Theresa McConnell, an adjuster in FIE's Austin foundation claims office, who\r\nreceived the file on December 30, 1998.  McConnell's original estimate of the claim was around\r\n$100,000, and her level of authority was $20,000.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn the same day, the Gerloff Company, a plumbing contractor, performed tests at\r\nFIE's request and found no leaks.  McConnell contacted Jeff Jackson, a civil engineer, to determine\r\nthe amount and cause of damage to the hardwood floor.  In the meantime, Ballard obtained bids to\r\nreplace the hardwood floor, ranging from approximately $89,000 to $171,000.  The $89,000 bid,\r\nfrom Boatright Floors, increased to $127,950 after Ballard requested that the floor be custom made,\r\nnot manufactured, as was the original floor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcConnell and Jackson went to the Ballard home on January 7, 1999, so that Jackson\r\ncould inspect the damage.  Jackson found two sources of moisture, one in the half bathroom and one\r\naround the refrigerator.  On January 11, McConnell sent a letter to Ballard stating that \"complete\r\nplumbing tests of your residence were conducted by Gerloff Co., Inc.  No leaks were located in the\r\nplumbing system of your residence.\"  On January 12, Jackson requested additional testing of the\r\nmoisture sources.  The additional test showed that the moisture level of the floor was twelve percent.\r\nBallard sent a letter to McConnell expressing concern that the buckled floors presented a tripping\r\nhazard; McConnell suggested temporary repairs while the claim was being investigated, including\r\ncovering the areas with carpet or replacing the buckled pieces with plywood.  Ballard agreed to\r\ncarpeting the entire floor or replacing the boards in \"trouble\" areas, but the temporary repairs were\r\nnever made.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcConnell requested an appraisal of the house by an independent appraiser because\r\nshe was concerned that the house was underinsured.  The appraiser valued the house at\r\napproximately $749,000.  McConnell notified Ballard of the appraisal, and Ballard requested\r\nincreased coverage if her current coverage was not adequate.  In early March, FIE increased the\r\ncoverage to $750,000 for the house and $450,000 for the contents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the meantime, on February 8, McConnell sent a letter to Ballard stating that FIE\r\nneeded a forty-five-day extension to complete the claim investigation.  At approximately this same\r\ntime, Ballard hired an attorney to represent her.  On February 24, FIE paid Ballard $108,316.50 for\r\naccidental water discharge damage to the floor, based on the $127,950 Boatright estimate, less\r\ndepreciation and the deductible.  FIE imposed an underinsurance penalty, paying the depreciated\r\nvalue instead of replacement cost, because the house, recently reappraised, was insured for only\r\n$313,000 at the time of the December 1998 claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn March 4, McConnell and contractors went to the Ballard home to inspect newly\r\ndiscovered damage, which was assigned a new claim number.  Ballard's lawyer was present for this\r\nmeeting and notified FIE in writing on March 11 that he was representing Ballard and that all contact\r\nconcerning the claims should be with him instead of Ballard.  At Ballard's request, FIE sent a\r\ntechnician to determine if her refrigerator was still leaking; the report showed additional damage\r\nbehind the refrigerator.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn early April, Ballard met Bill Holder, an indoor air quality consultant, on a plane\r\nflight.  Upon hearing about the damage to Ballard's house and physical symptoms that her family\r\nwas having, Holder suggested that she might have a mold problem.  Holder came to the Ballard\r\nhouse on April 5 at Ballard's insistence to take some air samples.  The samples contained mold\r\nspores, including a type of mold called <em>stachybotrys</em>, which produces toxins that may cause health\r\nproblems.  On April 7, Ballard's lawyer sent a letter notifying FIE of the mold findings.  Ballard,\r\nconcerned about possible health effects of the mold, moved with her husband, Ron, and three-year-old son to the nanny's apartment.  FIE's attorney suggested on April 8 that the parties mediate their\r\ndispute.  Meanwhile, Holder met with Ballard, McConnell, and Steve Shelburne, McConnell's\r\nsupervisor, on April 13 to discuss the mold findings.  At the meeting, Holder explained the possible\r\nhealth effects of mold and that mold grows \"exponentially.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE sent engineers from Rimkus Consulting to take air samples on April 14.  Holder\r\nand others returned to the house to conduct tests on April 21.  On April 23, Holder told Ballard that,\r\nbased on the new test results, she and her family immediately needed to move out of the house. \r\nBallard's family took Holder's advice and left the house that day, leaving behind their belongings. \r\nThey and their nanny moved into the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, which FIE agreed to pay for until\r\na more permanent location was found.  Ballard and her family moved out of the Four Seasons and\r\ninto a rental home around June 1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAround the same time, FIE paid about $8,000 for a shower leak claim in late April,\r\nabout $25,000 for damage related to an ice-maker leak claim in late April, and about $45,900 for\r\nsupplemental damage to walls and sheet rock in early May.  On May 5, Ballard filed suit in Travis\r\nCounty against FIE for breach of contract, deceptive trade practices, breach of the duty of good faith\r\nand fair dealing in the claims handling process, and negligence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn preparation for mediation, also in May, Rimkus prepared an estimate to remediate\r\nand repair the house and the contents, which totaled $382,000.  Ballard's expert estimated that\r\nremediation would cost approximately $1,015,500.  The parties proceeded to mediation for three\r\ndays in late May, which ended unsuccessfully on May 27.  That same day, FIE invoked the appraisal\r\nprovision of the insurance policy, available if the parties do not agree on valuation of a claim.  Under\r\nthe appraisal provision, both parties were to choose independent appraisers to evaluate the claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE notified Ballard in its May 27 letter that it had designated Peter de la Mora, a\r\nstructural engineer with extensive experience in the construction industry, as its appraiser.  Ballard\r\nchose as her appraiser an attorney, who had to resign a few months later because of trial obligations. \r\nBoth parties agreed that Michael Schless, a former county-court-at-law judge, would be the\r\n\"umpire,\" as termed in the policy, to whom the appraisers would submit their differences if they\r\nfailed to agree on the amount of loss.  Ballard then chose another attorney, Mike Duffy, as her\r\nsuccessor appraiser in November 1999.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFrom May through July 1999, Ballard submitted additional claims for leaks in the\r\nroof, two leaks in the water tank room, water damage in the garage and barn, water damage under\r\nthe kitchen sink, leaks in the nanny's apartment, loose tiles on the porch, and a fountain leak.  In\r\nJune, Sandra Clanton replaced Theresa McConnell as the adjuster.  On August 30, FIE paid\r\napproximately $382,000 for mold remediation and repair of the house and contents.  Ballard's\r\nattorney returned the checks on the ground that the payments were based on \"invalid\" bids.  In\r\nFebruary 2000, FIE again tendered checks for approximately $382,000, which Ballard's attorney\r\ndeposited into the registry of the court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe appraisal process continued for several months, then the appraisers met for four \r\ndays in November 2000 to determine the amount of loss.  The appraisal decision, issued on\r\nNovember 16, 2000, awarded $1,287,092.72, deducting amounts that FIE had previously paid, for\r\nthe house, its contents, and additional living expenses.  Although both appraisers and the umpire\r\nsigned the decision, only FIE's appraiser and the umpire agreed to the amount of the award.  On\r\nNovember 18, FIE sent checks for the amount of the appraisal decision to Ballard's attorney, who\r\nagain deposited the checks into the registry of the court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMeanwhile, the lawsuit proceeded, with the parties conducting discovery and various\r\nhearings.  FIE filed a motion to transfer venue to Hays County, where the house was located, on the\r\nground that venue was mandatory in Hays County because this was a property damage claim.  The\r\ndistrict court denied the motion to transfer venue in November 1999.  FIE later sought to exclude\r\nRonald Allison's personal injury claims on the ground that the toxic effects of mold were not\r\nsufficiently established in the scientific community.  Just before trial, the district court excluded\r\nAllison's claims on the basis that his expert witnesses did not have reliable epidemiological studies\r\nabout the health effects of exposure to mold.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe case proceeded to trial on May 7, 2001.  The jury began deliberations on May 30,\r\n2001 and returned a verdict in favor of Ballard the next day.  The jury awarded $2,547,350 to replace\r\nthe home; $1,154,175 to remediate the home; $2,000,000 to replace the contents of the home;\r\n$350,000 for past and future additional living expenses; $176,000 for Ballard's costs of the appraisal\r\nprocess; $5,000,000 for Ballard's mental anguish; $12,000,000 in punitive damages; and $8,891,000\r\nfor attorneys' fees.  The district court rendered a final judgment on October 30, 2001, for over $33\r\nmillion, reducing actual damages by $2,045,204.28 (the total amount that FIE had already paid to\r\nBallard on her claims) and including prejudgment interest and a statutory penalty under article 21.55\r\nof the insurance code on portions of the award.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE filed motions for new trial, for remittitur, and  to modify the judgment.  The\r\ndistrict court denied the motion for remittitur.  The motions for new trial and  to modify the judgment\r\nwere overruled by operation of law.  Allison appeals the district court's rulings concerning the\r\nexclusion of his causation expert witnesses.  FIE appeals all of the jury's findings and several district\r\ncourt rulings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>ALLISON'S APPEAL</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn two issues, Allison urges that the district court erred in granting FIE's\r\n<em>Daubert</em>/<em>Robinson</em> motion to exclude causation opinions of expert witnesses and as a result granting\r\nFIE's no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment as to Allison's personal injury claims.<strong>  </strong><em>See\r\nDaubert v.

Gordon, Ph.D. and Eckardt Johanning, M.D., agreed that exposure to mold\r\ncaused Allison's toxic encephalopathy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tToxic tort cases require proof of both general and specific causation about the effects\r\nof the toxic substance.  <em>Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d at 714.  \"General causation is whether a substance is\r\ncapable of causing a particular injury or condition in the general population, while specific causation\r\nis whether a substance caused a particular individual's injury.\"  <em>Id.</em>  One can prove general causation\r\neither through experiments to show that a substance is capable of causing a particular injury or by\r\nattempting to show that exposure to a substance increases the risk of a particular injury.  <em>Id. </em>at 714-15.  Specific causation cannot be based on inferred general causation; general causation must be\r\naffirmatively proved.  Among the underlying data to support Allison's proof of general causation\r\nwas a study by Dr. Gordon and Dr. Johanning of twenty people who were exposed to mold in a\r\nbuilding.  The district court found that although the experts' foundational data to prove general\r\ncausation met the requirements of <em>Daubert</em> and <em>Robinson</em>, the data was unreliable according to the\r\nfactors discussed in <em>Havner</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe question in <em>Havner</em> was whether the experts' foundational data was sufficiently\r\nreliable to show that the drug Bendectin caused birth defects.  In <em>Havner</em>, as here, the underlying data\r\nincluded epidemiological studies, which \"examine existing populations to determine if there is an\r\nassociation between a disease or condition and a factor suspected of causing that disease or\r\ncondition.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 715.  The <em>Havner </em>court determined that for an epidemiological study to be a\r\nreliable foundation, it must be unbiased in its design, otherwise properly designed, properly\r\nexecuted, and show that exposure to the substance more than doubles the risk of injury.  <em>Id.</em> at 717-19.  Another factor for determining if an epidemiological study is reliable is that it must be capable\r\nof repetition with the same results ninety-five percent of the time, known as a confidence interval\r\nof ninety-five percent.  <em>Id.</em> at 723.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAllison argues that the district court incorrectly applied <em>Havner</em> because \"[t]he\r\ndecision clearly states that epidemiology is a permissive, not mandatory, type of evidence that a\r\nplaintiff may choose in a toxic tort case.\"  But the <em>Havner</em> court concluded that <em>if</em> an expert relies on\r\nepidemiological studies, those studies must meet certain criteria.  <em>Id.</em>  Considering the totality of the\r\nevidence presented by Allison, a crucial underpinning for the opinions of Allison's causation experts\r\nwas an epidemiological study; therefore, the district court appropriately determined that the factors\r\ndiscussed in <em>Havner</em> applied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Gordon testified in his deposition that calculation of a confidence interval for the\r\nresults of the study was \"premature.\"  A calculation of the risk factor was also premature. \r\nAdditionally, Dr. Gordon could not say whether the techniques used were generally accepted.  The\r\nepidemiological study on which Allison's experts relied therefore does not meet the <em>Havner</em>\r\nrequirement of a ninety-five percent confidence interval, nor does it show that exposure to the\r\nsubstance more than doubles the risk of injury.  <em>Id.</em> at 717-18, 722-23.  </span><span>Further, the causation experts'\r\ntestimony was not based on a reliable foundation as required by <em>Havner</em>.  If an expert relies on\r\nunreliable foundational data, any opinion drawn from that data is likewise unreliable.  </span><span><em></em></span><span><em>Id.</em> at 714</span><span><em></em></span><span>. \r\nBecause Allison did not establish a reliable foundation for the admission of general causation\r\nevidence, we need not address the evidence relating to specific causation.  </span><span>Therefore, we cannot</span><span> say\r\nthat the district court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of Allison's causation experts. \r\nAccordingly, we overrule Allison's first issue and uphold the district court's order excluding the\r\ntestimony of Allison's causation experts.</span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>FIE's No-Evidence Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his second issue, Allison contends that the district court erred in granting FIE's no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment as to Allison's personal injury claims.  A party\r\nseeking a no-evidence summary judgment must assert that no evidence exists as to one or more of\r\nthe essential elements of the nonmovant's claims on which it would have the burden of proof at trial. \r\n<em>Holmstrom v. Lee</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1352360\"><a href=\"/opinion/1352360/holmstrom-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 530 (Tex. App.--Austin 2000, no pet.).  A no-evidence summary\r\njudgment is properly granted if the nonmovant fails to bring forth more than a scintilla of probative\r\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of the nonmovant's claim\r\non which the nonmovant would have the burden of proof at trial.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i);\r\n<em>Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d at 711.  If the evidence supporting an element rises to a level that would enable\r\nreasonable, fair-minded persons to differ in their conclusions, then more than a scintilla of evidence\r\nexists.  <em>Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d at 711.  Less than a scintilla of evidence exists when the evidence is \"so\r\nweak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion\" of fact, and the legal effect is that\r\nthere is no evidence. <em> Kindred v.

In its fourth issue, FIE contends that the district\r\ncourt erred in denying its motion to transfer venue to Hays County.  Because the civil practice and\r\nremedies code allows the interlocutory review of an order denying a motion based on mandatory\r\nvenue and FIE elected not to seek such review, Ballard urges that FIE waived its right to transfer by\r\nforegoing interlocutory review.  We reject this position because it is inconsistent with the permissive\r\nnature of sections 15.064 and 15.0642.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

Asserting that the nature of Ballard's causes of action is\r\nirrelevant, FIE further contends that \"[i]f any of Ballard's causes of actions sought recovery of\r\ndamage to her home, the trial court had no discretion to deny the motion.\"  We disagree.  The venue\r\nprovision that FIE asserts is applicable and mandatory provides that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[a]ctions for recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property, for\r\npartition of real property, to remove encumbrances from the title to real property, for\r\nrecovery of damages to real property<em>,</em> or to quiet title to real property shall be brought\r\nin the county in which all or a part of the property is located.</span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id. </em>§ 15.011.

FIE now argues on appeal that the\r\nlegislature abrogated the dominant-purpose test with the enactment of section 15.004 of the civil\r\npractice and remedies code in 1995.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.004 (if lawsuit\r\nhas two or more claims arising from same transaction or occurrence, with one claim governed by a\r\nmandatory venue provision and another governed by a permissive venue provision, the mandatory\r\nvenue provision controls); <em>see also Marshall v.

Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

By any reasonable construction, we may not read the provision by the expansive\r\ninterpretation that FIE would have us adopt.  Even though FIE urges this Court to read \"plain and\r\ncommon meaning\" into its reading of the statute, accepted principles of construction require that the\r\nprovision in question be construed in its present context and given a rational meaning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf we were to look at the words \"recovery of damages to real property\" in isolation,\r\nwe would concede that the phrase may be sufficiently broad to encompass the expansive reading\r\nurged by FIE.  But we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole. \r\nContrary to FIE's assertion that the nature of the causes of action is irrelevant and that only the\r\nremedy sought is relevant, section 15.011 specifically addresses five types of \"actions\" relating to\r\n\"Land\"--the title of the section<sup> (6)</sup>--that mandate venue in a particular county.  The <em>actions </em>are:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tfor recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tfor partition of real property,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tto remove encumbrances from the title to real property,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tfor recovery of damages to real property, or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tto quiet title to real property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 15.011.  That the word \"action\" must be read to modify each\r\nof these is clear beyond cavil.  Thus, we must look to the \"true\" nature of the action to determine\r\nwhether the mandatory venue provision applies.  <em>Renwar Oil Corp. v.

Reading the relevant\r\nphrase in its entire context, then, gives support for the more narrow interpretation.  <em>See </em>1 Scott\r\nBrister, et al., <em>Texas Pretrial Practice</em> § 9.34 (2000).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWere we to interpret the provision to allow for mandatory venue in all instances in\r\nwhich any damages are sought relating to a dwelling, no matter the nature of the action, we believe\r\nwe would be extending beyond permissible bounds the statute's language.

To assist with the analysis of\r\nFIE's legal and factual sufficiency challenges, we will summarize FIE's acts of which Ballard\r\ncomplains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>The Complained-of Acts</em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the trial was long and the arguments complex, </span><span>each of Ballard's causes of\r\naction revolve around the following core of complained-of acts:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t1.\tPlumbing test</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs part of FIE's insurance code violation, Ballard complains that Theresa McConnell\r\nmisrepresented to her that \"complete\" plumbing tests had been performed on the house even though\r\nMcConnell \"secretly\" thought that there might be other leaks.  In December 1998, Ballard reported\r\na claim that her hardwood floor was water-damaged.  FIE retained the Gerloff Company, a plumbing\r\ncontractor, to determine whether there was an ongoing leak causing the floor to remain wet.  On\r\nJanuary 11, 1999, McConnell forwarded a copy of the Gerloff report to Ballard.  The report\r\ndescribed the procedures employed and time taken to test  the building drain piping, domestic water\r\npiping, and air conditioning condensate lines, and further stated that no shower pan test was\r\nconducted.  Enclosing a copy of the plumbing test results, McConnell represented in a cover letter\r\nthat \"[c]omplete plumbing tests of your residence were performed . . . .  No leaks were located in the\r\nplumbing system of your residence.\"  A Gerloff plumber testified that the tests were complete\r\naccording to his company's procedures.  He testified that he was asked to do a complete test and that\r\nit was a \"complete test of the plumbing system, going by our procedures.\"  The tests were complete\r\nin the context of the leaks that existed on December 30, 1998, when the testing was done. \r\nMcConnell's concerns about the possibility of additional leaks were not secret.  Despite the report\r\nthat no leaks were found, she contacted Jeff Jackson, a civil engineer, to determine the amount and\r\ncause of damage to the hardwood floor.  In her cover letter enclosing the Gerloff report, McConnell\r\nstated that Jackson had been retained in the investigation of the claim and the \"cause of the problem\"\r\ncontinued.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t2.\tCompletion-of-claim letter</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcConnell wrote a letter to Ballard on February 8 saying that FIE required a forty-five-day extension because \"[t]he additional time is needed to complete our claim investigation.\" \r\nMcConnell admitted at trial that FIE had all of the information that it needed to evaluate the claim\r\nbut that she needed the additional time to obtain the authority from supervisors to pay the claim\r\nbecause she did not have that level of authority</span><span>.  FIE paid the claim on February 24, 1999, less than\r\nthree weeks after McConnell's letter.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t3.\tRefusal to pay claim/failure to promptly pay</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard also argues that FIE violated the insurance code because FIE admitted that\r\nas of May 17, 1999, it had obtained all of the information it needed to pay for remediation of the\r\nhouse.  She urges that FIE tendered insufficient and untimely payments.  Because of FIE's piecemeal\r\npayments and intentional delays in paying her claims after it had all of the information it needed on\r\nMay 17, 1999, Ballard contends that FIE refused to pay the claims without conducting a reasonable\r\ninvestigation of the claims and that it failed to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and\r\nequitable settlement of the claims when its liability had become reasonably clear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE paid the first claim for hardwood floor damage on February 24, 1999.  It based\r\nthe payment on a bid from Boatright Floors, less depreciation and the deductible.  FIE paid the\r\ndepreciated value instead of replacement cost because the house was underinsured.  Ballard\r\nimmediately claimed that this was a partial payment because she thought the Boatright bid was too\r\nlow.  Thereafter, Ballard began submitting other claims.  Within the next couple of months, she\r\nsubmitted a claim for a shower leak, ice maker leak, and supplemental damage to sheet rock and\r\nwalls.  FIE paid all of these claims, which Ballard again accepted as partial payments.  Nevertheless,\r\nBallard contends that because of the completion-of-claim letter, plumbing test letter, and FIE's\r\ninvocation of the appraisal provision, full payment of these claims and other pending claims was\r\ndelayed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t4.\tDenial of coverage</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard argues that FIE tried to deny the hardwood floor damage claim under an\r\nexclusion in the policy for foundation problems.  </span><span>The first adjuster to handle the claim was Sean\r\nDollery, who visited the home on December 22, 1998.  Although his initial reaction was that\r\nfoundation settling might be the cause of the hardwood floor damage, he changed his mind after\r\nseeing the water damage to the floor.  </span><span>In response to her attorney's question--\"About how long did\r\nhe talk to you about this being a slab settling problem?\"-- Ballard testified:  \"Until Richard Roberts\r\ngot there [that day] and started pulling up boards that showed the migration of water.\"  Dollery\r\nstopped suggesting that it was a slab-settling problem \"about 20 minutes after Richard Roberts had\r\npulled up some boards.\"</span><span>  From then on, FIE handled the hardwood floor damage as a covered claim.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t5.\tSham and fraudulent bids</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard complains that FIE intentionally paid her inadequate sums based on sham and\r\nfraudulent bids FIE received from contractors who subsequently refused to perform the work for the\r\namount of the bids.  These contractors were then retained by FIE as its experts in this litigation.  </span><span>FIE\r\nobtained bids from many contractors during the course of handling the claims and paid the claims\r\naccording to its own valuation, assisted by the bids.  FIE based the hardwood floor claim payment\r\non a bid from Boatright Floors, which was the lowest bid that it received.  Ballard contends that the\r\npayment was invalid because the Boatright bid was only good for thirty days and had expired by the\r\ntime that FIE made the payment on February 24, 1999.  FIE counters that it did not receive the bid\r\nuntil February 5, just a few weeks before it made payment.  After mold was discovered in the Ballard\r\nhome, FIE hired Rimkus Consulting to prepare a remediation bid.  Because Rimkus had no\r\nexperience in the relatively new field of mold remediation, its engineers talked with Ballard's\r\nconsultants to find out more about the process.  The remediation bid that Rimkus submitted in\r\npreparation for mediation was considerably less than the bid from Ballard's experts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard also contends that FIE based its August 1999 payments on expired bids,\r\nbecause two companies that had made bids would not do the work for Ballard at the prices they had\r\nquoted to FIE.  But by that time they had been retained as FIE's expert witnesses.  Ballard further\r\ncontends that de la Mora's estimates during the appraisal process were not based on like kind and\r\nquality.  De la Mora testified that he determined like kind and quality replacement costs during the\r\nappraisal process.  One of the contractors who submitted a bid to de la Mora also testified that he\r\nprepared his bid based on like kind and quality materials.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t6.\tInvocation of the appraisal provision</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBallard urges four complaints concerning FIE's invocation of the appraisal provision:\r\n(i) the mere invocation of the provision was a breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing\r\nbecause it was intended for the purposes of delay and to gain leverage in negotiations; (ii) FIE\r\ndeliberately appointed an appraiser who was not independent or competent; (iii) FIE refused to\r\ninclude all of the pending claims in the appraisal; and (iv) FIE intentionally withheld estimates and\r\ninformation from its own appraiser.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder Ballard's standard form homeowner's insurance policy, either party may\r\nrequest an appraisal if it becomes apparent that the parties cannot agree on the value of a claim or\r\nclaims.  FIE's employees testified that they invoke the appraisal provision rarely, only if it is\r\napparent that the parties cannot agree on the appraised value.  FIE asserted the provision here after\r\nan attempt to settle at mediation failed, although it was apparent long before then that Ballard and\r\nFIE did not agree about the value of her claims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPeter de la Mora, a structural engineer who was FIE's appraiser, had a business\r\nrelationship with FIE before working on this appraisal.  However, he has never been an employee\r\nof FIE.  Further, FIE instructed de la Mora to determine costs on his own, not from any figures that\r\nFIE had.  He had no restriction on receiving assistance from outside experts.  He had years of\r\nexperience in the homebuilding industry.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe letter invoking the appraisal provision listed three of the five claims that were\r\npending as of late May 1999.  Ballard testified that she asked FIE to include all of the claims in the\r\nappraisal but that FIE did not want to do that, suggesting the appraisal did not cover all of her claims. \r\nDe la Mora testified that although the appraisal did not include all of the claim numbers, the fact that\r\nthe appraisal covered the entire house encompassed all of claims.  Additionally, the amendment to\r\nthe appraisal decision stated that because \"some of the claim numbers may have been improperly\r\nincluded, and [o]thers may have been improperly excluded,\" \"the Appraisal Decision was intended\r\nto be a comprehensive statement\" of the cost to remediate or replace the house, its contents, the\r\ngroundskeeper's house, plus additional living expenses, \"considering only those claims which were\r\nproperly subject to the appraisal.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t7.\tUnderinsurance</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe amount of insurance on the Ballard home was tied to the county tax appraisal,\r\nnot the resale value of the house.  In 1996, Ballard's agent told her that the insurance coverage was\r\ninsufficient to cover the full value of the home.  She replied that she wanted to keep the insurance\r\nat the value of the tax appraisal, then signed a form rejecting an increase in coverage.  The amount\r\nof insurance on the home when Ballard filed the hardwood damage claim was $313,000. \r\nMcConnell, concerned that the house might be underinsured, requested a property appraisal in\r\nJanuary 1999.  After seeing that the appraised resale value was approximately $750,000, Ballard\r\nrequested an increase in her insurance coverage.  Because this increase did not occur until after the\r\npayment of the first claim, FIE imposed an underinsurance penalty on its payment of the hardwood\r\nfloor claim.  It paid Ballard for the actual cash value of the floor, deducting depreciation, instead of\r\npaying the full replacement value.  Ballard contends that FIE thus misrepresented that her policy\r\ncovered replacement costs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t8.\tReservation-of-rights letter</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 30, 1998, FIE sent a standard form homeowner's policy reservation-of-rights letter, which restated exclusions from the policy that might apply.  Insurance companies must\r\nassert a reservation of rights or risk waiving any coverage defenses that they may have.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,\r\n<em>State Farm Lloyds v. Borum</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1984669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1984669/state-farm-lloyds-v-borum/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span>, 892 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2001, pet. denied).  The fact\r\nthat the form letter contained inapplicable exclusions for damage by \"waves\" and \"earthquake\" is\r\ninconsequential.</span><span>  Furthermore, there was no evidence of any connection between this letter and how\r\nFIE handled Ballard's claims, and coverage was not at issue.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving summarized FIE's acts of which Ballard complains, we now turn to FIE's\r\nlegal and factual sufficiency challenges to the jury's findings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE urges in its first issue that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's finding that it breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard.  FIE\r\nfurther contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support a finding that its\r\nalleged breach caused damages to Ballard.  We disagree.  Some evidence supports the jury's finding\r\nthat FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing and that the breach caused damages to\r\nBallard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn insurer breaches its duty of good faith and fair dealing by denying or delaying\r\npayment of a claim when \"the insurer's liability has become reasonably clear.\"  Tex.

Whether an insurer breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing is a fact\r\nissue.  <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 56.  Moreover, the question of whether an insurer's conduct is\r\nreasonable in the face of acknowledged liability is one peculiarly tailored to the province of the jury. \r\n<em>See id.</em>  </span><span><em></em></span><span><em><span><strong></strong></span></em></span><span><span>In determining whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a judgment for breach\r\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing, we resolve all conflicts in the evidence and draw all\r\ninferences in favor of the jury's findings.  <em>Id.</em> at 51.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tThere is some evidence from which a jury could find that FIE failed to attempt in\r\ngood faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of claims after its liability had become\r\nreasonably clear.  <em>See </em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21, § 4(10)(a)(ii); <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 56.  FIE\r\ndoes not challenge that its liability was reasonably clear.  Its liability was only \"fairly debatable\" for\r\na brief time, when FIE's outside investigator, Sean Dollery, expressed his preliminary view that the\r\nclaim might not be covered.  <em>See</em> <em>Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 69 (Hecht, J., concurring).  Ballard contends\r\nthat FIE, after its liability had become reasonably clear, delayed payment of the hardwood floor claim\r\nthrough its plumbing test and completion-of-claim letters.  She further contends that FIE breached\r\nits duty of good faith and fair dealing toward her by invoking the appraisal provision in May 1999,\r\nwhen at the same time it had all of the information that it needed to pay for remediation of the home. \r\nShe argues that waiting for payment of her claims during the eighteen-month appraisal process\r\nallowed mold to spread and cause irreparable damage to the house.  While Ballard alleges that other\r\nacts are part of the pattern of acts that violated article 21.21, these are the primary acts of which she\r\ncomplains.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tSome evidence shows that McConnell's lack of authority or experience in handling\r\nclaims of this magnitude caused delays in processing the claims.  McConnell knew on the first day\r\nshe received the claim that estimates to replace the hardwood floor were over $100,000.  She had\r\na level of authority only to pay claims up to $20,000 and had never worked on a claim this large. \r\nAdditionally, McConnell testified that she had sufficient information that liability was reasonably\r\nclear on the hardwood floor claim as of February 1, 1999.  Yet she wrote the February 8 letter to\r\nBallard, stating that FIE required a forty-five-day extension because \"[t]he additional time is needed\r\nto complete our claim investigation.\"  McConnell admitted at trial that FIE had all of the information\r\nthat it needed to <em>evaluate</em> the claim but that she needed the additional time to obtain the authority\r\nfrom supervisors to <em>pay</em> the claim because she did not have that level of authority.  A jury could have\r\nfound that she misrepresented to Ballard why she needed more time to handle the claim.  Ballard\r\nargues also that McConnell made a misrepresentation in the \"complete plumbing test\" letter, when\r\nin fact not all plumbing had been tested.  Both McConnell and a plumber with the Gerloff Company\r\ntestified that the term \"complete plumbing test\" is not literally true, because the standard industry\r\ntest runs through underground systems only, not any pipes above the first floor.  Although\r\nMcConnell correctly characterized the test that Gerloff performed, the jury could have reasonably\r\nconcluded that this statement was a misrepresentation.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tOther evidence called into question FIE's good faith handling of the claims.  Ballard\r\ntestified that although she \"begged\" to remove the wood floor because it was a tripping hazard,\r\nMcConnell told her that she would \"jeopardize coverage\" if she removed the floor.  McConnell\r\ntestified that Ballard could have removed the floor at any time after payment of the $108,000 to\r\nreplace the floor.  Ballard countered that she did not want to remove the floor with the claim\r\ninvestigation ongoing for months, even after she received the $108,000 payment.  She testified that\r\nshe did not remove the floor \"[b]ecause [FIE] kept calling for inspections.  And if I had torn up the\r\nfloor, there would be nothing there for them to inspect.\"  As part of the pattern of mishandling and\r\ndelay in handling her claims, Ballard also testified that FIE's large number of inspections were\r\ndesigned to harass and cause further delay.  McConnell countered that the inspections were necessary\r\nto determine the cause of the water damage and because Ballard kept submitting claims for new\r\ndamage.  The jury, as the trier of fact in this case, could have chosen to believe Ballard instead of\r\nMcConnell.  A jury judges the credibility of witnesses and the weight given their testimony.  <em>Ford\r\nv. Panhandle &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

Further, Ballard contended that every payment from FIE was insufficient to pay for the\r\ndamage, leading to further delays that caused the mold to spread.  The jury heard additional evidence\r\nthat although McConnell admitted that FIE had all of the information that it needed to pay for\r\nremediation of the house as of May 17, 1999, FIE instead invoked the appraisal provision after it\r\nfailed to settle the claims at mediation.  During the appraisal process, which lasted eighteen months,\r\nnothing was done to remediate the mold in Ballard's house.  The mold continued to grow.

Accordingly, FIE's legal and factual sufficiency\r\nchallenges to the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing finding must fail.  We overrule\r\nFIE's first issue.  Even if we were to apply the standard for breach of the duty of good faith and fair\r\ndealing set forth in <em>Aranda v.

This amount takes into account the reduction\r\nin the final judgment for the $2,045,204.28 that FIE had previously paid to Ballard, information that\r\nthe court's charge did not present to the jury.

Ballard counters that FIE waived this argument because it did not properly\r\nbrief this issue. <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Because FIE's argument on this issue is grounded in\r\nits lengthy discussion that it did not breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing, we find that FIE\r\nsufficiently briefed this issue for the Court.  The jury found that FIE violated the DTPA by engaging\r\nin a false, misleading, or deceptive act or practice by (1) representing that services had or would have\r\ncharacteristics or benefits that they did not have, (2) representing that services are or will be of a\r\nparticular standard or quality when they were of another, (3) representing that an agreement confers\r\nor involves rights, remedies, or obligations that it did not have or involve, or (4) representing that\r\nwork or services have been performed, when the work or services were not performed.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nBus. &amp; Com.

Additionally, the jury could have concluded from the\r\nevidence that Ballard's reliance on the plumbing test letter caused further damages to the house. \r\n</span><span>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, the evidence is legally sufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's finding that FIE committed a DTPA violation. Weighing all of the evidence, we\r\ncannot say that it is so weak as to be clearly wrong or manifestly unjust. <em>Cain</em>, 709 S.W.2d at 176. \r\n</span><span>We overrule this part of FIE's second issue and affirm the jury's finding that FIE committed a DTPA\r\nviolation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury also found that FIE engaged in an unconscionable action or course of action,\r\nwhich is \"an act or practice that, to a consumer's detriment, takes advantage of the lack of\r\nknowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair degree.\"  Tex.

Ballard's sole\r\ncontention in this regard is  that any misrepresentation by FIE equates with unconscionable conduct. \r\nThat is not the law. \"[N]ot every misrepresentation of fact, even an intentional one, constitutes\r\nunconscionable conduct.\"  <em>Latham v.

Having found sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of a DTPA violation, but no\r\nno evidence to support the jury's findings of unconscionability and  fraud, we overrule FIE's legal\r\nand factual sufficiency challenge to the DTPA violation finding and sustain FIE's challenges to the\r\nunconscionability and fraud findings.

Under this clause, either party may\r\ninvoke an appraisal if the party disagrees about the value of a claim or claims.  Each party then hires\r\nits own appraiser.  If the two appraisers cannot agree on the value, they select an umpire, or a district\r\njudge will appoint one if the appraisers cannot agree on an umpire.  A decision signed by any two\r\nof the three is binding as to the value of the claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE invoked the appraisal provision on May 27, 1999, the day that the parties failed\r\nto reach a settlement at mediation.  FIE chose as its appraiser Peter de la Mora, a structural engineer\r\nwho had performed appraisals for FIE approximately four or five times.  Ballard chose an attorney\r\nas her appraiser, who had to resign a few months later because of trial obligations.  Both parties\r\nagreed that Michael Schless, a former county court at law judge, would be the umpire.  Ballard then\r\nchose another attorney, Mike Duffy, as her successor appraiser in November 1999.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOver the course of the next year, the appraisers gathered estimates for remediation\r\nand replacement of the Ballard house.  In November 2000, de la Mora, Duffy, and Schless worked\r\nfor four days to determine the appraisal decision.  They met at the Ballard house with various\r\nexperts, then de la Mora and Duffy discussed their proposals with Schless.  On November 16, 2000,\r\nthey issued an appraisal decision in the amount of $1,287,092.72, which took into account payments\r\nthat FIE had already made to Ballard.  Both appraisers and Schless signed the decision, but Duffy,\r\nBallard's appraiser, disputed the amount of the award.  Under the terms of the insurance policy, the\r\nappraisal decision was binding because two of the three agreed on the amount.  FIE then sent checks\r\nto Ballard's attorney for the amount of the appraisal decision.  De la Mora and Schless issued an\r\namendment to the appraisal decision on January 30, 2001, to reflect the intent of the decision to be\r\na \"comprehensive statement of the actual cash value to replace or remediate the structure of the\r\nresidence and the groundskeeper's house, the contents of the residence, and the alternative living\r\nexpenses, considering only those claims that were properly subject to the appraisal.\"  Duffy did not\r\nparticipate in the amendment because he no longer had authority to act on behalf of Ballard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe will first address FIE's preliminary issue that Ballard waived her right to\r\nchallenge de la Mora as FIE's appraiser because she did not raise the issue until after the appraisal\r\ndecision was made.  Having learned from de la Mora's deposition, taken soon before the appraisal\r\ndecision, that he had previously done work for FIE, Ballard contended in an amended petition that\r\nthe appraisal decision should be set aside.  She claimed that FIE breached the insurance contract by\r\nselecting an appraiser who was neither competent nor independent.  The effect of an </span><span></span><span>appraisal\r\ndecision is to </span><span></span><span>estop one party from contesting the issue of the value of damages in a suit on the\r\ninsurance contract.  <em>Hennessey v.

P. 94, which FIE did in an amended answer.  Ballard has arguably waived\r\nany challenge because she did not oppose FIE's appraiser until after determination of the appraisal. \r\nWe will nevertheless address FIE's legal and factual sufficiency challenges to the jury's findings\r\nconcerning the appraisal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE argues in a sub-issue concerning the appraisal that the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the finding that the appraisal decision was rendered as a result of\r\nfraud, accident,<sup> (7)</sup> or mistake.  In question seven of the charge, the jury was instructed that fraud means\r\nin part that a material misrepresentation was made and that the speaker made the misrepresentation\r\nwith the intent that the other party act on it.  Ballard contends that the jury had sufficient evidence\r\nto find fraud because the appraiser intentionally prevented Ballard from receiving like kind and\r\nquality replacement, failed to use available price and quality information, intentionally excluded\r\nitems from the appraisal process, and based his calculations on fraudulent bids from unqualified\r\ncontractors.  There is no evidence in the record to support these contentions.  For example, although\r\nBallard claims that de la Mora intentionally prevented her from receiving like kind and quality\r\nreplacement, de la Mora testified that he determined like kind and quality replacement costs during\r\nthe appraisal process.  One of the contractors who submitted a bid to de la Mora also testified that\r\nhe prepared his bid based on like kind and quality materials.  Despite the allegation, we find no\r\nevidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that the appraiser intentionally prevented Ballard\r\nfrom receiving like kind and quality replacement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence also does not show that anyone intentionally excluded items from the\r\nappraisal.  </span><span>At oral argument, Ballard contended that she wanted to submit \"everything\" in the\r\nappraisal but that FIE refused.  </span><span>Although Ballard made fourteen separate claims between December\r\n1998 and  August 1999, she had only submitted five claims by the time the appraisal process began\r\nin May 1999.  FIE's May 27, 1999 letter listed only three of those five claims, but de la Mora\r\ntestified that because the entire house had to be remediated, it did not matter which claim numbers\r\nwere included.  Additionally, the amendment to the appraisal decision</span><span> stated that the decision \"was\r\nintended to be a comprehensive statement\" of the cost to remediate or replace the house, its contents,\r\nand the groundskeeper's house, </span><span>plus additional living expenses.  There is no evidence that de la\r\nMora or FIE intended to exclude items from the appraisal.  Likewise, de la Mora's reliance on bids\r\nfrom contractors that he chose does not rise to the level of fraud.  Ballard opposed the bids because\r\nsome of the contractors had done previous work for FIE and because some of the contractors, such\r\nas the mold remediation company, had never submitted bids for work of this magnitude.  A lack of\r\nexperience does not equate with making material misrepresentations in a bid.  Given that mold\r\nclaims were still relatively novel in April 1999, when mold was discovered in Ballard's house,<sup> (8)</sup> it\r\nis not surprising that the contractors had little experience in the area of mold remediation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard objects to the bids solicited by de la Mora in part because she does not agree\r\nwith the valuation of the repair and replacement costs.  \"[A] finding of disparity, even gross\r\ndisparity, between an appraisal award and the cost of repair, cannot support a finding of bias or\r\npartiality without additional evidence.\"  <em>Hennessey</em>, 895 S.W.2d at 799.  Ballard fails to cite to any\r\nadditional evidence.  Based on our review of the record, we cannot find any evidence from which\r\na reasonable jury could infer that the appraisal decision was rendered as a result of fraud.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard argues that the appraisal decision was also rendered as a result of mistake\r\nbecause it listed \"alternative living expenses\" instead of \"additional living expenses\" for the costs\r\nof Ballard's family living away from their house.  The jury was instructed that \"mistake\" means a\r\nsituation in which the appraisers were operating under a mistake of fact such that their award does\r\nnot speak to their intention or that the error in the award is so great that it shows gross partiality,\r\nundue influence, or corruption.  Here, the \"mistake\" about which Ballard complains is similar to a\r\nclerical error.  De la Mora testified that the term \"alternative living expenses\" was intended to be the\r\nsame as \"additional living expenses\" and that the mere difference in wording did not affect the\r\nappraisal process.  A clerical error that does not affect the intention of the appraisers cannot support\r\na finding of mistake.  <em>See Providence Lloyds</em>, 877 S.W.2d at 878 (column labeled \"court award\"\r\ninstead of </span><span>\"agreed award\" did not constitute a mistake).  Based on our review of the record, we\r\ncannot find sufficient evidence to support a finding that the appraisal was rendered as a result of\r\nmistake.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's finding that the appraisal decision was the result of fraud, accident,\r\nor mistake.  Weighing all of the evidence, the evidence is also factually insufficient to support the\r\njury's finding that the appraisal decision was the result of fraud, accident, or mistake.  We therefore\r\nsustain FIE's sub-issue, reverse the jury's finding, and render judgment on this finding in favor of\r\nFIE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its second sub-issue concerning the appraisal that the evidence is\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the finding that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser.  We agree.  Ballard attempted to prove lack of independence because de la\r\nMora had a pre-existing business relationship with FIE.  However, Ballard presented no evidence\r\nthat FIE influenced or exercised control over de la Mora.  There is no evidence that de la Mora ever\r\nwas an employee of FIE or had a financial interest in the claims.  Instead, Ballard's evidence shows\r\nan arm's-length business relationship between FIE and de la Mora, which was fully disclosed before\r\nthe appraisal decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard presented evidence that:  de la Mora's company performed twenty to twenty-five percent of its work for FIE and eighty percent of its work overall for insurance companies; de\r\nla Mora had performed four or five appraisals for FIE before the Ballard appraisal; and that de la\r\nMora had worked with FIE's attorney ten times since 1996.  The showing of a pre-existing\r\nrelationship, without more, does not support a finding of lack of independence. <em> Gardner v. State\r\nFarm Lloyds</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335421\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335421/gardner-v-state-farm-lloyds/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 143 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.).  De la Mora has\r\nnever been an employee of FIE.  Further, FIE instructed de la Mora to determine costs on his own,\r\nnot from any figures that FIE provided.  FIE never told him how to estimate the costs.  He had no\r\nrestriction on receiving assistance from outside experts.  As an independent contractor, de la Mora\r\namply demonstrated that despite his previous business dealings with FIE, he exercised independent\r\njudgment in the appraisal process; Ballard has directed us to no evidence to the contrary, and we\r\ncannot find any support for her position in the record.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard attempted to prove lack of competence on the ground that de la Mora had no\r\nexperience with molds or mold remediation.  The evidence shows, however, that de la Mora was\r\ncompetent as an appraiser.  He has a degree in civil engineering, is a registered professional engineer,\r\nhas thirty-three years of experience in structural engineering, and has built hundreds of houses,\r\nincluding houses comparable to the Ballard house.  Because he had no experience with mold\r\nremediation, he retained mold experts to assist him with the remediation estimate.  This was no\r\ndifferent than Ballard's appraiser, an attorney, retaining mold experts to assist him with his\r\nestimates.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ballard, we conclude that the\r\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser.  Weighing all of the evidence, the evidence is also factually insufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's finding that FIE failed to appoint a competent, independent appraiser.  We\r\ntherefore sustain FIE's sub-issue, reverse the jury's finding, and render judgment on this finding in\r\nfavor of FIE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we conclude that the appraisal was not rendered as a result of fraud, accident,\r\nor mistake and that the appraiser was competent and independent, the appraisal decision is binding\r\nand enforceable.  <em>Wells</em>, 919 S.W.2d at 683.  We thus sustain FIE's third issue.  Under the terms of\r\nthe insurance contract, each party must pay its own appraiser and bear the other expenses of the\r\nappraisal and umpire equally.  Therefore, we reverse the jury's award of $176,000 to Ballard for her\r\nreasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process and render that Ballard take nothing on this\r\nclaim.  Given, however, that Ballard's claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is\r\nstatutorily based and extra-contractual, outside of the bounds of the appraisal decision, Ballard's\r\ndamages are not limited to the amount of the appraisal decision.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Knowing Violation</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its seventh issue, FIE challenges the legal sufficiency of the jury's finding that FIE\r\nknowingly engaged in deceptive acts or practices toward Ballard, contending that there is no\r\nevidence to support this finding.  We agree.  \"Knowingly,\" as the district court correctly charged the\r\njury, is the \"actual awareness of the falsity, unfairness, or deception of the conduct in question.\" \r\nTex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 17.45(9) (West 2002).  \"[A]ctual awareness may be inferred where\r\nobjective manifestations indicate that a person acted with actual awareness.\"  <em>Id.</em>  \"Actual awareness\"\r\ndoes not mean merely that a person knows what he is doing; rather, it means that a person knows that\r\nwhat he is doing is false, deceptive, or unfair.  In other words, a person must think at some point,\r\n\"Yes, I know this is false, deceptive, or unfair to [the other person], but I'm going to do it anyway.\"<em> \r\nSt. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Dal-Worth Tank Co.,</em> 974 </span><span></span><span>S.W.2d 51, 53-54 (Tex. 1998).<em>  </em>Actual\r\nawareness is more than conscious indifference toward another's rights or welfare.  <em>Id.</em> at 54.  We\r\nmust affirm the jury's finding if we find more than a scintilla of evidence that FIE's conduct fit\r\nwithin the definition of \"knowingly.\"  <em>See Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742776\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742776/burroughs-wellcome-co-v-crye/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 499\r\n(Tex. 1995).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is some evidence from which the jury could have found that FIE breached its\r\nduty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard, but there is no evidence in the record that FIE was\r\nactually aware that its actions toward Ballard were false, deceptive, or unfair--that is, that FIE was\r\nmore than consciously indifferent to Ballard's rights and welfare.  Under the <em>St. Paul Surplus </em>test,\r\nrelied upon by both parties, we must find that someone with FIE must have had a subjective\r\nawareness of the falsity, deception, or unfairness before FIE may be held to have acted knowingly. \r\nBallard admits that a single act does not rise to the level of knowing conduct and without citation\r\nto the record  tries to paint a \"knowing\" picture from the pattern of acts relied upon for her lack of\r\ngood faith and fair dealing claim.  Ballard contends, for example, that McConnell's plumbing test\r\nletter was a knowing misrepresentation.  McConnell based this statement on information that she\r\nreceived from the plumbing company, and we cannot say this is evidence from which a reasonable\r\njury could infer that McConnell made a knowing misrepresentation.  She had no conversation with\r\nBallard about the plumbing test, instead simply forwarding information after she received the report\r\nfrom the plumbing company.  Additionally, FIE relied on the statement that \"complete plumbing\r\ntests\" were made as much as Ballard did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard further argues that FIE knowingly refused to pay an estimate from one of its\r\nbidders.  Ballard makes no citation to the record for this contention, and we cannot find any support\r\nfor it in our review of the record.  Ballard next contends that FIE \"intentionally withheld\" approved\r\nclaim funds to gain leverage to settle all matters in controversy.  We disagree.  Although the first\r\npayment for the hardwood floor damage may have taken longer than necessary, FIE did pay all but\r\none of Ballard's claims, both before and after she filed suit against FIE.  The record does not contain\r\nevidence that FIE knowingly withheld claim payments to gain leverage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard also argues that FIE intentionally made payments based on sham and\r\nfraudulent bids from contractors who refused to perform work for the amount of the bids and who\r\nwere retained as FIE's experts.  Although \"sham and fraudulent bids\" was one of Ballard's themes\r\nduring the trial, we cannot find any evidence to support this theme.  FIE obtained bids from many\r\ncontractors during the course of handling the claims and paid the claims according to its own\r\nvaluation, assisted by the bids.  Ballard also attempted to show that FIE based its payments on\r\nexpired bids, because two companies that had made bids would not do the work for Ballard at the\r\nprices they had quoted to FIE.  They in fact would not do the work because they had been retained\r\nas FIE's expert witnesses by that time.  Both Ballard and FIE hired contractors involved in the claims\r\nas its experts in the trial, which is not itself unreasonable because they were familiar with the damage\r\nto the Ballard home.  The record does not contain evidence that any of FIE's conduct concerning its\r\nbids from contractors was knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBallard next argues that FIE improperly invoked the appraisal provision to gain\r\nleverage against her.  FIE had a right to invoke the appraisal provision under the terms of the\r\nhomeowner's insurance policy and did so when mediation attempts failed.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Gardner</em>, 76\r\nS.W.3d at 142.  There is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could infer that this\r\nconduct was knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair.  Nor was the appointment of an appraiser with\r\na previous business relationship with FIE evidence of knowing conduct.  A previous business\r\nrelationship, standing alone, is not probative of knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair conduct.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nat 143.  De la Mora disclosed his relationship with FIE in his deposition, taken before the appraisal\r\ndecision was issued.  Ballard did not object to de la Mora until <em>after</em> receiving that decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Ballard argues that FIE intentionally withheld estimates and information from\r\nde la Mora.  De la Mora testified, however, that FIE told him that he had to arrive at his own\r\nestimates, independent of anything that FIE had.  FIE did so because the insurance policy required\r\nthat de la Mora be independent.  Complying with the terms of the insurance policy is no evidence\r\nof knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair conduct.  The only evidence that might support a finding of\r\nknowing conduct, which Ballard did not raise with regard to this issue, is that McConnell made a\r\nmisrepresentation to Ballard that she needed more time to evaluate the claim, when in fact she\r\nneeded time to obtain authority from her supervisors to pay the claim.  Although McConnell\r\nadmitted at trial that she needed more time to gain authority, not to investigate, we cannot say that\r\nthis was part of a pattern of knowing conduct or that this conduct resulted in damages to Ballard. \r\nIt merely delayed payment of the first claim by less than three weeks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn examining the finding that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing, we\r\nfocused on whether FIE acted reasonably in handling Ballard's claims.  <em>See Giles</em>, 950 S.W.2d at 56;\r\n<em>Lyons</em>, 866 S.W.2d at 601.  The test for finding knowing conduct, enunciated in <em>St. Paul</em> <em>Surplus</em>,\r\nis much more stringent:  we must find some evidence in the record that someone with FIE must have\r\nhad a subjective awareness of the falsity, deception, or unfairness.  <em>See Connell Chevrolet Co. v.\r\nLeak</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433441\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433441/connell-chevrolet-co-inc-v-leak/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 893 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, no pet.).  None of the evidence to which\r\nBallard points demonstrates such a subjective awareness.  Because the record contains no evidence\r\nthat FIE engaged in  knowingly false, deceptive, or unfair conduct, we sustain FIE's seventh issue\r\nchallenging the legal sufficiency of this finding.  <em>See Croucher</em>, 660 S.W.2d at 58.  Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the jury's finding and render judgment on this issue in favor of FIE.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury awarded punitive damages and mental anguish damages based on conduct\r\ncommitted \"knowingly or fraudulently.\"  Under the insurance code, a party may recover punitive\r\ndamages and mental anguish damages only if the jury finds that the violation was committed\r\nknowingly.

We will apply the general\r\nstandards for reviewing a grant of a no-evidence motion for summary judgment.<em>  See, e.g.</em>,</span><span>\r\n<em>Holmstrom</em>, 26 S.W.3d at 530.</span><span>  Because the district court's order does not specify the ground or\r\ngrounds relied on for its ruling, we will affirm the summary judgment if any of the theories </span><span></span><span>Ballard\r\nadvanced are meritorious.  <em>See Carr</em>, 776 S.W.2d at 569.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE asserted in its second amended answer that Ballard had the burden of segregating\r\ndamages among covered and non-covered losses, under the doctrine of concurrent causation.  Under\r\nthis doctrine, when covered and non-covered perils combine to create a loss, the insured is entitled\r\nto recover only that portion of the damage caused solely by the covered peril. <em>Travelers Indem.

App.--San Antonio 1999, pet. denied).  The doctrine of concurrent causation is not\r\nan affirmative defense or an avoidance issue; rather, it is a rule embodying the basic principle that\r\ninsureds are not entitled to recover under their insurance policies unless they prove that their damage\r\nis covered by the policy.  <em>Wallis</em>, 2 S.W.3d<em> </em>at 303.  Thus, an insured may only recover for the amount\r\nof damage caused solely by the covered peril.  <em>Id.</em>  The burden is on the insured to prove coverage. \r\n<em>Id. </em> The insured must therefore present some evidence upon which the jury can allocate the damages\r\nattributable to the covered peril.  <em>Id. </em> Because allocation is central to the claim for coverage, an\r\ninsured's failure to carry the burden of proof on allocation is fatal to the claim. <em> Id.</em>  The insured must\r\nattempt to segregate the loss caused by the covered peril from the loss caused by the excluded peril. \r\n<em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe doctrine of concurrent causation is inapplicable in this case for two reasons. \r\nFirst, FIE never denied any claim at issue in this appeal on the ground that the claim was a non-covered peril.  Second, FIE asserted the doctrine of concurrent causation pursuant to article 21.58(b)\r\nof the insurance code, which states that \"[i]n any suit to recover under a contract of insurance, the\r\ninsurer has the burden of proof as to any avoidance or affirmative defense that must be affirmatively\r\npleaded under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.58(b) (West Supp.\r\n2003).  All of Ballard's claims presented to the jury were extra-contractual, beyond recovery under\r\nthe contract of insurance.  Therefore, we overrule FIE's sixth point of error and affirm the district\r\ncourt's ruling granting Ballard's no-evidence summary judgment on concurrent causation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong><em>District Court's Evidentiary Rulings</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its fifth issue that the district court abused its discretion and deprived\r\nFIE of a fair trial by excluding evidence of settlement offers made during mediation, some instances\r\nof Ballard's conduct toward FIE's adjusters, and de la Mora's testimony that Ballard's lawyers\r\ndelayed the appraisal process.  FIE further argues that the district court abused its discretion by\r\nallowing evidence about the possible health effects of mycotoxins from molds.  We apply an abuse\r\nof discretion standard to the question of whether a district court erred in an evidentiary ruling. <em>\r\nNational Liab. &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v.

Discussions in\r\nalternative dispute resolution proceedings are generally confidential and inadmissible as evidence\r\nagainst a participant in any judicial proceeding.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 154.073(a)\r\n(West Supp. 2003).  Evidence of conduct made in settlement negotiations can be admissible if\r\noffered for a purpose other than to show liability, such as \"negativing a contention of undue delay.\" \r\nTex. R.

However, as the district court stated, a \"cloak of confidentiality\" surrounds\r\nmediation, and the cloak should be breached only sparingly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE cites <em>Avary v. Bank of America, N.A.</em> for the proposition that it should have been\r\nable to disclose evidence of Ballard's conduct during the mediation.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2184604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2184604/avary-v-bank-of-america-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">779</span></a></span> (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 2002, pet. denied).  <em>Avary</em> is distinguishable:  it concerned a bank's breach of fiduciary\r\nduty in rejecting a higher settlement offer during mediation.  The court allowed evidence of the\r\nbank's conduct during mediation because it went to the heart of the parties' dispute.  <em>Id.</em> at 796. \r\nHere, the district court excluded this evidence primarily because FIE's conduct was at issue, not\r\nBallard's.  <em>See</em> Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21, § 4(10)(a)(ii) (conduct in question is whether <em>insurer</em>\r\n\"fail[ed] to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim with\r\nrespect to which the insurer's liability has become reasonably clear\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE's reliance on two other cases allowing evidence of settlement negotiations is also\r\nmisplaced.  <em>See U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Millard</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388539\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388539/us-fire-ins-co-v-millard/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (Tex.

In both cases, because the entire basis of the\r\nclaim was the amount of the insurance company's settlement offer, it was necessary for the court to\r\nadmit settlement negotiation evidence.  Here, although the district court could have admitted\r\nevidence of Ballard's demands at mediation for the purpose of countering her contention that FIE\r\nunduly delayed in paying her claims, <em>see</em> Tex. R. Evid. 408, he excluded the evidence because of the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice and because of the general rule that settlement discussions are\r\nconfidential.  In light of the standard of review, we decline to breach the \"cloak of confidentiality\"\r\nthat exists to encourage settlement discussions.  <em>See Wilborn</em>, 835 S.W.2d at 261.  Accordingly, we\r\nhold that the district court did not act in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner or without regard for\r\nany guiding rules or principles in excluding evidence of settlement offers made during mediation. \r\n<em>Beaumont Bank</em>, 806 S.W.2d at 226.  Further, FIE has failed to show how the exclusion of this\r\nevidence led to the rendition of an improper judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding certain\r\nevidence of Ballard's interaction with FIE's adjusters.  FIE asserts that the jury could not properly\r\ndetermine whether FIE acted reasonably without hearing evidence of Ballard's conduct, which FIE\r\nalleges obstructed FIE's efforts to adjust her claims, caused delay, and generally defeated FIE's\r\nattempts to settle.  Evidence that FIE attempted to admit included Ballard's threats to use her $44\r\nmillion trust fund to fight FIE and to snort <em>stachybotrys</em> if necessary to hurt FIE.  The district court\r\nexcluded the character evidence after balancing what he termed the \"extremely, extremely limited\r\nprobative value\" of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and\r\nmisleading the jury.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Evid. 403, 404.  Further, he specifically excluded the evidence\r\nabout Ballard's wealth because courts \"try to keep those kinds of tawdry considerations out of the\r\nfact-finding process.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough other evidence of Ballard's conduct may have added coloratura to the trial,\r\nthere was ample evidence before the jury showing the flavor of Ballard's conduct.  For example, the\r\njury saw dozens of letters that Ballard sent to FIE throughout the claims-handling process.  As early\r\nas mid-January 1999, Ballard complained in a letter to McConnell about \"your 'experts' traipsing\r\nin and out of my house.\"  In a March 8, 1999, letter to McConnell, Ballard wrote, \"I hope you take\r\ngreat comfort knowing while you are out trying to manipulate the facts and throw an inadequate sum\r\nof money at me that doesn't get me to first base, my family is living in a house that clearly is\r\ndangerous.\"  She ended her letter with, \"You should be ashamed.\"  After moving out of the house,\r\nshe demanded that FIE pay for accommodations at the expensive Four Seasons Hotel in Austin as\r\n\"the only thing I've found suitable.\"  These letters and many others more than adequately conveyed\r\nthe flavor of Ballard's contentious stance toward FIE, which began within weeks of her filing the\r\nDecember 17, 1998 claim.  Additionally, the jury heard evidence that Ballard changed both lawyers\r\nand appraisers during the claims-handling and litigation process, which it could have inferred as a\r\ncontribution to delays.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile the jury did not get to see the full picture of Ballard's conduct, we believe that\r\nit saw enough of the picture to evaluate whether her conduct hampered FIE's efforts.  Accordingly,\r\nwe hold that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in excluding certain evidence\r\nof Ballard's interaction with FIE's adjusters.  More importantly, FIE failed to demonstrate  how the\r\nexclusion of this evidence led to the rendition of an improper judgment</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE further asserts that the district court erred in excluding testimony by de la Mora\r\nthat Ballard \"obstructed and delayed\" the appraisal process.  FIE argues that by excluding this\r\ntestimony, the </span><span>\"court permitted Ballard to profit from the false impression that [FIE] delayed the\r\nprocess.\"  The jury heard evidence that the appraisal process began in May 1999 and did not\r\nconclude until November 2000.  But it heard no evidence about why the process took so long\r\nbecause the judge granted Ballard's motion in limine that no mention be made of Ballard or her\r\nappraiser delaying the appraisal process.  The district court's practice of allowing jurors to question\r\nwitnesses at the end of their testimony resulted in the district court posing the following question to\r\nde la Mora:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT:\tWhy did the appraisal process take 18 months?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE WITNESS:\tThe appraisal process took 18 months because the Ballard\r\nattorneys kept keeping us from going to the house to do the work\r\nthat we needed to do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The district court then excused the jury, reprimanded de la Mora, and warned that he would be in\r\ncontempt of court if he \"advocated\" for FIE again.  The jury returned, and the district court requested\r\nthat they disregard de la Mora's answer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor the same reasons as discussed concerning Ballard's conduct toward FIE, we\r\nconclude that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in excluding evidence of\r\nBallard's conduct purportedly delaying the appraisal process and that FIE has failed to show how\r\nthe exclusion of this evidence led to the rendition of an improper judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its last contention that the district court abused its discretion, FIE argues that the\r\ndistrict court should not have allowed admission of evidence that mycotoxins from molds can cause\r\nserious personal injury.  FIE urges that the district court should have excluded all evidence in this\r\narea because it granted FIE's motion to exclude Allison's causation experts, who would have\r\ntestified about the health effects of exposure to the mycotoxins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAmong the few references to the health effects is that one of the mycotoxins is a\r\nknown liver carcinogen and, in a letter from Ballard put into evidence by <em>FIE</em>, that one of the Ballard\r\npets had a \"terrible skin problem caused by <em>Stachybotrys</em> exposure.\"  The district court, after careful\r\ndeliberation, allowed this evidence because it was relevant to Ballard's mental anguish claim, not\r\nfor her own fear of getting ill but her concern for her family.<sup> (9)</sup></span><span> The district court put a further\r\nsafeguard in place by twice instructing the jury that personal injury claims were not part of the case. \r\nThe general rule is that an instruction to disregard a subject not part of the case will cure error.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>, <em>Fowler v. Garcia</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525524/fowler-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 520 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1985, no writ).  We therefore\r\nhold</span><span> that the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in allowing evidence of the health\r\neffects of mycotoxins and that FIE has failed to show how the admission of this evidence led to the\r\nrendition of an improper judgment.  Having found no abuse of discretion in the district court's\r\nevidentiary rulings of which FIE complains, we overrule FIE's fifth issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em>Attorneys' Fees</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFIE contends in its tenth issue that there is insufficient evidence of reasonable and\r\nnecessary attorneys' fees and thus that we should reverse the jury's award of $8.9 million in fees to\r\nBallard's attorneys.  </span><span>A plaintiff who prevails in a DTPA cause of action \"shall be awarded court\r\ncosts and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees.\"  Tex.

Disciplinary R. Prof.\r\nConduct 1.04, <em>reprinted in</em> Tex. Govt. Code Ann., tit. 2, subtit. G app. A (West 1998) (Tex. State\r\nBar R. art. X, § 9)).  The fact finder should consider a contingent fee agreement, but \"the plaintiff\r\ncannot simply ask the jury to award a percentage of the recovery as a fee because without evidence\r\nof the factors identified in rule 1.04, the jury has no meaningful way to determine if the fees were\r\nin fact reasonable and necessary.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 818-19.  The plaintiff must ask the jury to award fees in a\r\nspecific dollar amount, not as a percentage of recovery.  <em>Id. </em>at 819.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tHere, the jury heard evidence of the above factors from Ballard's attorneys' fees\r\nexpert, Richard Cedillo.  He discussed all eight factors from rule 1.04, including the quality of the\r\nattorneys on the case and the time required.  He stated that a contingent fee contract of thirty-five\r\npercent on the first eight million and forty percent on any award above that amount was fair.  FIE\r\ncontends that the evidence is insufficient partly because Ballard's attorneys did not submit hourly\r\ntime sheets.  Cedillo testified, based on his experience on complex cases and review of the Ballard\r\nfile, that Ballard's attorneys spent a great deal of time on her case because of the paper, motions,\r\npreparation for seventy depositions, trial preparation, and complex issues involved.  He further\r\nexplained that Ballard's attorneys did not keep hourly time sheets because they were under a\r\ncontingent fee contract, not an agreement based on an hourly fee.  Thus, Ballard would not expect\r\nstatements about their time on the case.  Having heard Cedillo's testimony, the jury awarded fees in\r\na specific dollar amount, as requested in the charge.  Cedillo's coverage of the factors stated in\r\n<em>Arthur Andersen</em>, including the suggestion that the dollar amount be based on the contingent fee,<em> </em>are\r\nsufficient evidence to support the award of attorneys' fees.  <em>See Vingcard A.S. v. Merrimac\r\nHospitality Sys., Inc</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1352746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1352746/vingcard-as-v-merrimac-hospitality-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 870 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2001, pet. denied) (jury award\r\nof dollar amount based on contingent fee, after hearing testimony of the rule 1.04 factors, met the\r\n<em>Arthur Andersen</em> requirements).  Accordingly, we overrule FIE's tenth issue and hold that there was\r\nlegally sufficient evidence of reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tWe cannot say, however, that the award of $8.9 million is still reasonable, given that\r\nwe have significantly reduced the damages awarded by the jury.  We remand the determination of\r\nattorneys' fees to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span>Article 21.55 Damages</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tFIE asserts in its eleventh issue that there was no basis for awarding or calculating\r\nany interest penalty under article 21.55 of the insurance code.  The purpose of article 21.55 is to\r\nobtain prompt payment of claims pursuant to policies of insurance, and its provisions are to be\r\nliberally construed to promote this purpose. </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><em><span>See</span></em></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span></span></span><span>Tex. Ins. Code Ann art. 21.55, <span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span>§ </span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span>8<span> (West Supp.\r\n2003).  Article 21.55 provides that \"if an insurer delays payment of a claim following its receipt of\r\nall items, statements, and forms reasonably requested and required . . . for more than 60 days, the\r\ninsurer shall pay damages and other items as provided for in Section 6 of this article.\"  Tex. Ins.\r\nCode art. 21.55, § 3(f).  Section six provides for eighteen percent annual interest on the amount of\r\nthe delayed payment, together with reasonable attorneys' fees.  <em>Id.</em> § 6.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\tFIE argues that there was no basis for the 21.55 penalty because Ballard did not prove\r\nor obtain jury findings that FIE violated the article.  As discussed above, we have found some\r\nevidence to support the jury finding that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing in\r\n\"[f]ailing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim\r\nwhen the insurer's liability has become reasonably clear.\"  Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21,\r\n§ 4(10)(a)(ii).  McConnell unequivocally testified that FIE had all of the information that it needed\r\nto pay the costs of remediation by May 17, 1999.  FIE did not pay any of those costs until August\r\n30, 1999, more than sixty days later.  Therefore, FIE subjected itself to the provisions of article\r\n21.55.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\t</span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span>But the record demonstrates that FIE did not cause all of the delay.  Ballard rejected\r\nFIE's August 30, 1999 payments of $382,738.69 on the ground that they were based on invalid bids,\r\nbut then accepted checks for the same amounts on February 17, 2000.  We find, therefore, that the\r\ndistrict court erred in calculating eighteen percent interest </span><span><span> </span></span><span>on $382,738.69 between August 30, 1999\r\nand February 17, 2000, because Ballard caused that delay in payment.  </span><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><span></span>Otherwise, we find that the\r\nevidence supports the district court's calculations of the eighteen percent penalty, based on evidence\r\nthat FIE delayed full payment of Ballard's claims for more than sixty days.  Accordingly, we remand\r\nthe statutory penalty issue to the district court for recalculation in accordance with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we find no error in the district court's rulings concerning Allison's claims,\r\nwe affirm the rulings of the district court in granting FIE's motion to exclude his causation experts\r\nand FIE's no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment pertaining to Allison's personal injury\r\nclaims.  </span><span>Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment dismissing Allison's personal injury\r\nclaims.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold that probative evidence supports the district court's denial of FIE's motion\r\nto transfer venue to Hays County.  We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in the evidentiary rulings of which FIE complains.  We also find sufficient evidence to\r\nuphold the jury's findings that FIE breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard\r\nand that FIE committed a DTPA violation.  After a thorough review of the evidence in the record,\r\nand with deference to the province of the jury, we hold that the evidence is both legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to uphold the jury's verdict on several other grounds of recovery.  We find insufficient\r\nevidence to support the jury's findings of unconscionability or fraud.  We additionally find\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that FIE failed to appoint a competent,\r\nindependent appraiser or that the appraisal decision was a result of fraud, accident, or mistake. \r\nBecause the court's charge specified that findings of either a breach of the duty of good faith and fair\r\ndealing or a DTPA violation are sufficient to uphold the jury's award of actual damages, we affirm\r\nthe actual damages award in part, in the amount of </span><span>$4,006,320.72, in addition to prejudgment and\r\npostjudgment interest as stated in the final judgment.  We reverse</span><span> the award of $176,000 for\r\nBallard's reasonable and necessary costs of the appraisal process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe further conclude that there is no evidence to support the jury's finding that FIE\r\n\"knowingly\" breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing toward Ballard.  Because a finding of\r\na knowing violation is required to uphold punitive and mental anguish damages, we reverse the\r\njury's awards for these damages and render judgment that Ballard take nothing for punitive and\r\nmental anguish damages.  </span><span>We uphold the district court's award of the article 21.55 statutory penalty\r\nin part and </span><span><span></span></span><span>remand the penalty for recalculation in accordance with this opinion</span><span><span></span></span><span>.  </span><span>We find sufficient\r\nevidence to support the award of attorneys' fees but cannot say that the amount of the award is\r\nreasonable, given our significant reduction of the jury's damages awards.  Therefore, we remand the\r\nissue of attorneys' fees to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\tJan P.

The parties to this appeal are Mary Melinda Ballard and her husband, Ronald Allison, the\r\nplaintiffs in the case below, and Fire Insurance Exchange, the defendant in the case below.  Ballard\r\nowns title to the house, and thus the homeowner's insurance is in her name.\r\n</p><p>2.   A \"mycotoxin\" is a toxic substance produced by mold.\r\n</p><p>3.   FIE also now argues that the district court failed to recognize the abrogation of the\r\ndominant-purpose test.  FIE fails to acknowledge that it based its argument at the hearing on the\r\ndominant-purpose test.\r\n</p><p>4.   <span>In light of the addition of section 15.004, we need not discuss the cases, cited by both sides,\r\nthat base their reasoning on the dominant-purpose test.\r\n<p>5.

The\r\npredecessor to section 15.011 contained the phrase \"for recovery of damages to real property\" until\r\n1983.  <em>See</em> Act of June 17, 1983, 68th Leg., R.S., ch. 385, 1983 Tex. Gen. Laws 2119 (Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. Ann. art. 1995, since repealed).\r\n<p>6.   In construing a statute, we may consider and, in this case, are informed, by the statute's\r\ntitle.  <em>See</em> Tex. Govt. Code Ann. § 311.021(7) (West 1998).\r\n</p><p>7.   Ballard does not contend that the appraisal decision was rendered as a result of accident.\r\n</p><p>8.   In 2001, \"</p></span><span>Farmers registered more than 12,000 </span><span>mold claims, up from 12 in 1999.

FIE, relying on <em>Temple-Inland Forest Products Corp. v.

FIE\r\ninterprets <em>Temple-Inland</em> too broadly.  The case only addresses fear of an <em>asbestos-related </em>disease\r\nin the absence of symptoms of any disease.  <em>Id.</em> at 93 (\"The question . . . is whether . . . fear of an\r\nincreased risk of developing an asbestos-related disease when no disease is presently manifest should\r\nbe permitted. . . .  We conclude that no such action should be recognized.\").\r\n</p></span></p>\r\n</div>",
