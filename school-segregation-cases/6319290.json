AFFIRMED AND CASE REMANDED.\n\n\n\n      Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Forrest Guddall and\n\nAnne E. Updegraff, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellant.\n\n\n\n      Nicholas W. Platt and Gregory T. Racette of Hopkins & Huebner,\n\nP.C., Des Moines, for appellee.\n\f                                           2\n\nWIGGINS, Justice.\n\n       While an inmate at the Clarinda Correctional Facility (CCF), the\n\nplaintiff, Kevin Walker, was assaulted by another inmate and seriously\n\ninjured.   Walker brought a tort claim against the State, a correctional\n\nofficer, and two activity specialists, claiming they negligently failed to\n\nensure his safety. The State sought summary judgment based upon the\n\ndiscretionary function and intentional tort exceptions under Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14 (2005). The district court denied the State’s motion, and\n\nthe State filed an application for interlocutory appeal, which we granted.\n\nWe now affirm the decision of the district court denying the State’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Prior Proceedings.\n\n       The State acknowledges that some of the underlying facts in the\n\ncase are disputed, but it claims that it is entitled to summary judgment\n\nas a matter of law.         A reasonable fact finder viewing the summary\n\njudgment record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff could find the\n\nfollowing facts.\n\n       CCF is a medium-security correctional prison of the Iowa\n\nDepartment of Corrections (IDOC). On January 8, 2005, Kevin Walker,\n\nan inmate at CCF, had a confrontation with inmate Darrell Humphrey,\n\nduring the breakfast turn out. 1           According to Walker, Humphrey, a\n\njailhouse lawyer, approached another inmate, Willie Evans, who was\n\ninvolved in challenging a rules violation, and offered his services for a\n\nsmall fee. When Walker advised Evans that he could handle the matter\n\non his own, Humphrey became angry with Walker and threatened to\n\nassault him.        Evans then became angry with Humphrey and an\n\n       1“Turn  out” means designated times for inmates to move from their cells or other\nlocations to another in the institution such as the breakfast room or the gym.\n\f                                    3\n\nargument between the two ensued.        This argument continued as the\n\ngroup made its way through the breakfast line.\n\n      After going through the line, Humphrey sat at a different table from\n\nWalker, Evans, and another inmate, Edward Willingham.         As they ate\n\ntheir breakfast, Evans and Humphrey continued to argue, shouting and\n\nthreatening each other from their respective tables. According to Walker,\n\nthe argument was louder than any other conversation in the room\n\nbecause the inmates had stopped talking and were listening to the\n\nargument. Walker did not report the threats, but asserts Correctional\n\nOfficer Thomas Walston, who was staffing the breakfast turn out, could\n\nhear the argument, including the threats of assault.      Officer Walston\n\nclaims he could not hear the specifics of the conversation.     However,\n\nafter Humphrey left the unit, Officer Walston talked to the remaining\n\ninmates involved in the argument and asked them what the problem was\n\nand was told everything was fine.\n\n      A short time later, Humphrey returned to the unit with David\n\nBarnett. Barnett was in a different unit, and it was a rules violation for\n\nhim to return with Humphrey.        Evans and Willingham continued to\n\nargue with Barnett and Humphrey, with some pushing and shoving\n\ngoing on. Barnett indicated the argument would be settled at the next\n\nturn out, the exercise turn out. He indicated they could fight in the gym\n\nbecause the yard was too cold that day. Walker alleges Officer Walston\n\noverheard these statements.\n\n      At some point, Officer Walston approached the group and\n\ninstructed Barnett to return to his unit. He did not, however, instruct\n\nEvans, who was on cell restriction, to return to his cell. When Barnett\n\ndid not leave immediately, Officer Walston escorted him out of the unit\n\f                                        4\n\nduring which time Barnett made comments about settling the argument\n\nat the next turn out.\n\n      During the exercise turn out, Walker went to the gym and played\n\nbasketball with other inmates.        On the other side of the gym, Evans,\n\nHumphrey, and Barnett were fighting in a blind spot that could not be\n\nseen from the office in the gym. 2          When the fight was over, Barnett\n\nwalked over to Walker, and stated something to the effect, “[T]his is what\n\nhappens when you shoot your mouth off.” Humphrey then approached\n\nWalker and assaulted him.         The assault knocked Walker unconscious\n\nand broke his jaw.\n\n      At the time of the exercise turn out, two activity specialists, Noel\n\nBogdanski and Richard Stipe, were on duty in the gym. They did not see\n\nthe fight involving Evans, Barnett, and Humphrey, or the assault on\n\nWalker.    Bogdanski was in the office of the gym either handing out\n\nequipment or filling out paperwork. Stipe was standing in the door of the\n\ngym as the inmates entered and could not see the areas where the two\n\nincidents occurred. Both Bogdanski and Stipe were aware of the blind\n\nspot in the gym, but did not monitor the area. Officer Walston filled out\n\na disciplinary report regarding the breakfast incident, but not until after\n\nWalker was assaulted.\n\n      On August 3, 2006, Walker filed a tort claim, pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode chapter 669, against the State and the three correctional staff\n\nmembers, claiming injury and damages due to the defendants’ negligence\n\nin failing to exercise reasonable care to protect Walker from a violent\n\nattack by another prisoner.        On February 6, 2007, the State Appeal\n\nBoard denied Walker’s claim. Thereafter, Walker filed this petition.\n\n      2Officer  Walston allowed inmate Evans to attend the turn out, even though he\nwas on cell restriction and was not supposed to be able to go to the gym.\n\f                                     5\n\n      In his petition, Walker contends that (1) Bogdanski and Stipe were\n\nnegligent in failing to properly supervise the exercise turn out, (2) Officer\n\nWalston was negligent for failing to alert Bogdanski and Stipe about the\n\nmorning confrontations and the threats made about the fight, (3) all of\n\nthe defendants were negligent in failing to ensure the safety of Walker in\n\nlight of the dangerous situation that existed in the gym at the time\n\nWalker was injured, and (4) all the defendants were negligent for allowing\n\na dangerous condition to exist in the gym.         Pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.5(2)(a), the district court ordered the State substituted for\n\nthe individually named defendants Walston, Bogdanski, and Stipe. See\n\nIowa Code § 669.5(2)(a) (2007) (substituting the state for defendant\n\nwhere defendant in a suit was an employee of the state acting within the\n\nscope of the employee’s employment at the time of the incident upon\n\nwhich the claim is based).      Thereafter, the State filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment asserting the State was entitled to immunity\n\npursuant to the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions\n\nunder Iowa Code section 669.14 (2005).\n\n      The State contended the policies of the IDOC permit prison staff to\n\nuse discretion in taking corrective action in the management of inmate\n\npopulations and in monitoring and supervising inmates, and therefore,\n\nthe correctional staffs’ actions are entitled to discretionary function\n\nexception under Iowa Code section 669.14(1). The State also asserted it\n\nis immune from any claim arising from an assault pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14(4).\n\n      The district court denied the State’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, concluding a genuine issue of material fact existed as to\n\nwhether the prison staff involved had knowledge of hostility or a history\n\nof prior trouble involving Walker. It did not explicitly address the State’s\n\f                                        6\n\ncontention that, as a matter of law, the discretionary function or\n\nintentional tort exceptions applied.           The State filed a motion to\n\nreconsider, which the district court overruled.        We granted the State’s\n\napplication   for    interlocutory    appeal    to   determine   whether   the\n\ndiscretionary function and intentional tort exceptions apply in this case.\n\n      II. Scope of Review.\n\n      We review the denial of a motion for summary judgment for\n\ncorrection of errors at law. Doe v. Cedar Rapids Cmty. Sch. Dist., 652\n\nN.W.2d 439, 442 (Iowa 2002). Summary judgment is appropriate\n\n      if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n      admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\n      that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the\n      moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\n\nIowa R. Civ. P. 1.981(3); accord Doe, 652 N.W.2d at 442.\n\n      A genuine issue of fact exists if reasonable minds can differ on how\n\nan issue should be resolved.         Seneca Waste Solutions, Inc. v. Sheaffer\n\nMfg. Co., 791 N.W.2d 407, 411 (Iowa 2010). When a fact’s determination\n\nmight affect the outcome of the suit, it is material. Id.; see also Baratta\n\nv. Polk County Health Servs., 588 N.W.2d 107, 109 (Iowa 1999).\n\n      III. Merits.\n      A. Iowa Tort Claims Act.              The Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA)\n\npermits an action by a prisoner “when the state negligently permits one\n\nin its custody to be injured by the violent assault of another prisoner.”\n\nBarnard v. State, 265 N.W.2d 620, 621 (Iowa 1978); cf. United States v.\n\nMuniz, 374 U.S. 150, 165, 83 S. Ct. 1850, 1859, 10 L. Ed. 2d 805, 816\n\n(1963) (noting the Federal Tort Claims Act allows for damages for\n\nemployee negligence in failing to protect federal prisoners). Although not\n\nan insurer of a prisoner’s safety, the state must exercise reasonable care\n\nto protect the prisoner from harm. Barnard, 265 N.W.2d at 621. For an\n\f                                     7\n\ninmate to recover for injuries incurred in an attack by another inmate,\n\nthe inmate must establish: “(1) the state institution knew or should have\n\nknown that a specific inmate suffered a risk of harm, and (2) the\n\ninstitution failed to use reasonable care to prevent the attack on the\n\ninmate.”     Speller v. State, 528 N.W.2d 678, 679 (Iowa Ct. App. 1995)\n\n(citing Mosby v. Mabry, 697 F.2d 213, 215 (8th Cir. 1982)); accord\n\nBarnard, 265 N.W.2d at 621–22 (noting that while not an exclusive list of\n\ncircumstances, liability has been imposed when threats, incidents of\n\nprior violence, and other reasonable cause to fear physical harm have\n\nbeen brought to the attention of authorities; when there has been a\n\nfailure to provide adequate supervision; and when authorities have\n\nplaced known hostile persons where they have access to each other).\n\nThe question raised is whether the discretionary function and intentional\n\ntort exception provisions of the Act provide the State with immunity from\n\nliability.\n\n       B. Discretionary Function Exception. A governmental entity is\n\nentitled to immunity only to the extent permitted by statute. Doe, 652\n\nN.W.2d at 443. “[L]iability is the rule and immunity the exception.” Id.\n\nThus, we narrowly construe the discretionary function exception.\n\nMadden v. City of Eldridge, 661 N.W.2d 134, 138 (Iowa 2003).            The\n\ngovernment has the burden of establishing entitlement to the statute’s\n\nprotection. Ette ex rel. Ette v. Linn-Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 656 N.W.2d 62,\n\n68 (Iowa 2002).\n\n       The Iowa Code provides the State shall be immune from tort\n\nliability for\n       [a]ny claim . . . based upon the exercise or performance or\n       the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or\n       duty on the part of a state agency or an employee of the\n       state, whether or not the discretion be abused.\n\f                                     8\n\nIowa Code § 669.14(1).\n\n      In Goodman v. City of LeClaire, 587 N.W.2d 232 (Iowa 1998), we\n\nabandoned the planning/operational bright-line test and adopted the\n\ntwo-prong analysis advocated in Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531,\n\n108 S. Ct. 1954, 100 L. Ed. 2d 531 (1988), to determine whether the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was applicable in a negligent excavation\n\nclaim brought against a city under the Municipal Tort Claims Act. 587\n\nN.W.2d at 238 (adopting the Berkovitz two-step analysis).               We\n\nsubsequently concluded this analysis was equally applicable under the\n\nITCA. See Schmitz v. City of Dubuque, 682 N.W.2d 70, 72 (Iowa 2004);\n\naccord Anderson v. State, 692 N.W.2d 360, 364 (Iowa 2005).\n\n      Under the Berkovitz test, the court must initially determine\n\nwhether the act in question was a matter of choice for the acting\n\nemployee. Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536, 108 S. Ct. at 1958, 100 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 540.   The discretionary function exception is inapplicable when a\n\nstatute, regulation, or policy requires a course of action for an employee\n\nto follow. Id. Next, if the action involved discretion on the part of the\n\nemployee, the court must consider whether the judgment was of the kind\n\nthe exception was designed to protect. Id.; accord Anderson, 692 N.W.2d\n\nat 364. We have adopted the Supreme Court view that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception “ ‘protects only governmental actions and decisions\n\nbased on considerations of public policy.’ ” Anderson, 692 N.W.2d at 364\n\n(quoting Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536–37, 108 S. Ct. at 1959, 100 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 541). The basis for the discretionary function exception is to “ ‘prevent\n\njudicial “second guessing” of . . . administrative decisions grounded in\n\nsocial, economic, and political policy’ through tort litigation, thereby\n\nprotecting [states] ‘from liability that would seriously handicap efficient\n\f                                      9\n\ngovernment operations.’ ” Ette, 656 N.W.2d at 67 (quoting Goodman, 587\n\nN.W.2d at 237).\n        [T]he primary factor in determining whether a particular\n        activity qualifies as a discretionary function is whether the\n        decision to act involves the evaluation of broad policy\n        factors. If so, the decision is more likely to be characterized\n        as a discretionary function.\n\nKeystone Elec. Mfg. v. City of Des Moines, 586 N.W.2d 340, 348 (Iowa\n\n1998) (citation omitted).\n\n        The appropriate analytical framework has thus been summarized\n\nas follows:\n        An inquiring court first must identify the conduct that\n        allegedly caused the harm. . . . The issue, then, is whether\n        this conduct is of the nature and quality that [the\n        government], in crafting the discretionary function exception,\n        sought to shelter from tort liability. That issue encompasses\n        two questions: Is the conduct itself discretionary? If so, is\n        the discretion susceptible to policy-related judgments?\n\nShansky v. United States, 164 F.3d 688, 690–91 (1st Cir. 1999); accord\n\nEtte, 656 N.W.2d at 67.\n\n        1. Conduct at issue. The first step in our analysis is to determine\n\nthe exact conduct that is at issue. Ette, 656 N.W.2d at 67. As previously\n\nnoted, the State must exercise reasonable care to protect prisoners from\n\nharm.     Barnard, 265 N.W.2d at 621.       Walker generally contends the\n\nState was liable under Iowa Code chapter 669 for the negligent\n\nsupervision of inmates, negligently failing to ensure his safety, and\n\nnegligently allowing a dangerous condition to exist in the gym.\n\n        2. Did the correctional staffs’ actions involve discretion?       With\n\nregards to Officer Walston, Walker alleged he failed to use reasonable\n\ncare because he failed to (1) alert staff and security of what was going to\n\nhappen in the gym, (2) write disciplinary notices on the involved inmates\n\nfor minor and/or major rule violations, (3) request an investigation and\n\f                                     10\n\nsegregation of the involved inmates, (4) prevent inmate Barnett from\n\nbeing out of placement, (5) prevent inmate Evans from leaving his unit in\n\nviolation of his cell restriction, and (6) engage in further discussions with\n\nthe inmates about the breakfast turn out argument. Walker asserts the\n\nState is not immune under the discretionary function exception because\n\nprison policies and procedures mandated Officer Walston take specific\n\nactions in light of the escalating verbal and physical confrontation\n\nbetween the inmates.       Walker further contends Activity Specialists\n\nBogdanski and Stipe were negligent because they failed to maintain\n\ndirect supervision over the inmates participating in recreational activities\n\nin the gym in violation of a mandatory policy. We begin our analysis by\n\nconsidering the policies Walker contends were violated by the activity\n\nspecialists.\n\n      Walker relies on CCF policy IO-SC-10 which provides that “[s]taff\n\nmust stay out of office areas to the greatest extent their duties allow and\n\nremain in personal contact with the offenders in their units,” and that\n\n“[o]ffenders involved in recreation activity . . . shall be subject to direct\n\nstaff supervision at all times when they are engaged in such activity.”\n\nWalker claims this policy required the activity specialists to provide\n\n“direct supervision [of inmates] at all times” and that their failure to do\n\nso subjected him to injury. Walker asserts the activity specialists were\n\naware of a blind spot in the gym where inmates could not easily be\n\nobserved and that neither activity specialist was specifically supervising\n\nthe inmates or observing the blind spot, which resulted in their failure to\n\ndiscover a fight between inmates that lasted up to fifteen minutes.\n\n      Upon our review, we disagree with Walker’s conclusion this policy\n\nimposed a nondiscretionary duty on the activity specialists in their\n\nsupervision of the inmates during their recreational period. Although the\n\f                                       11\n\npolicy directs staff to stay out of office areas and remain in personal\n\ncontact with offenders, the requirement is not absolute.            The policy is\n\nconditioned by the additional language “to the greatest extent their\n\nduties allow.” The policy clearly anticipates the need for prison staff to\n\nuse their discretion in the provision of supervision and acknowledges\n\nthat there are times when the job will require staff to be in an office area.\n\nCf. Calderon v. United States, 123 F.3d 947, 950 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding\n\nthe Bureau of Prison’s policy provides a mandatory duty of safekeeping,\n\nbut did not direct the manner by which it must be fulfilled, thereby\n\nproviding for discretion on the part of prison personnel); accord Parrott v.\n\nUnited States, 536 F.3d 629, 637 (7th Cir. 2008). We also do not find the\n\nprovision providing that offenders engaged in recreational activity “shall\n\nbe   subject   to   direct   staff   supervision   at   all    times”   placed   a\n\nnondiscretionary duty on the activity specialists.            Although the policy\n\nplaces a duty on the staff, it did not define “subject to direct staff\n\nsupervision,” leaving the means and method of carrying out the duty\n\nsubject to discretion. Cf. Cohen v. United States, 151 F.3d 1338, 1343\n\n(11th Cir. 1998) (noting that “even though a statute or regulation\n\nimposes a general duty on a government agency the discretionary\n\nfunction exception may still apply if the agency retains sufficient\n\ndiscretion in fulfilling that duty”); Ochran v. United States, 117 F.3d 495,\n\n500 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding the use of the language “shall . . . protect”\n\ndid not mean that the regulation “left no room for the [U.S. Attorney] to\n\nexercise judgment or choice” about how to protect witnesses).             Walker\n\nhas failed to identify any prison policy or procedure that required a\n\nspecific course of action for the activity specialists to follow in their\n\nsupervision of inmates during the exercise turn out.               Therefore, we\n\f                                    12\n\nconclude the supervision of inmates during the exercise turn out\n\ninvolved discretionary conduct on the part of the activity specialists.\n\n      Walker asserts CCF policies IN-VI-21, IS-CL-04, IO-SM-02, and\n\nPO-V-17 required Officer Walston to take specific actions and did not\n\nallow him to use his discretion under the circumstances. IDOC policy\n\nIS-CL-04 is entitled “Keep Separates.” It provides: “Staff who become[]\n\naware of an event or situation between two offenders that may potentially\n\npose a risk to the offenders while housed in an institution or residential\n\nfacility shall report that information to the . . . Shift Supervisor.” While\n\npolicy IS-CL-04 required the reporting of events or situations that may\n\nconstitute a danger to inmates, the policy does not expressly provide\n\nwhat constitutes a potential risk to the offender and, therefore, such a\n\ndetermination must rely on the judgment or discretion of the staff.\n\nMoreover, the policy does not require the report be prepared immediately.\n\nThe policy provides discretion to staff in the handling of the reporting\n\nfunction.\n\n      Policy IO-SM-02, A-2a is entitled “Administrative Segregation.” It\n\nprovides:   “An offender may be placed in (Administrative Segregation)\n\nAS3 at any time the Shift Supervisor determines there is credible\n\nevidence that the offender may be in physical danger.” Policy IO-SM-02\n\nis also discretionary.   It allows the shift supervisor to use his or her\n\ndiscretion to determine whether an offender needs to be placed in\n\nadministrative segregation for their protection. Cf. Cohen, 151 F.3d at\n\n1343 (holding the statutory provision did not mandate a specific,\n\nnondiscretionary course of conduct for the bureau of prisons to follow in\n\nclassifying prisoners). This policy did not mandate any specific action on\n\nthe part of Officer Walston.\n\f                                        13\n\n       Under policy PO-V-17, a unit officer was required to “[m]aintain\nsecurity of [the unit] and control of the offenders at all times.” Like the\npolicies already addressed, this policy imposes a general duty without\nprescribing any specific mandatory action by staff and allows for staff\ndiscretion in maintaining security and control of offenders.\n       Policy IN-VI-21 was the correctional facility disciplinary policy in\n\neffect at the time of the incident occurring prior to Walker’s assault.3\n\nPart IV of the policy provides for the disciplinary procedures to be used\n\nfor major offenses. The policy defines major offenses to include assault,\n\nfighting, threats and intimidation, out of placement of assignment, and\n\nobstructive or disruptive conduct. 4 Walker relies on the following portion\n\nof this policy to assert Officer Walston violated institutional policy in his\n\nhandling of the situation at the breakfast turn out.\n\n       A. Preparing The Disciplinary Report\n\n          1. Whenever an employee observes or discovers\n             misconduct or a threatening situation, the employee\n             will, if possible, direct the offender to take corrective\n             action.    If the corrective action is insufficient or\n             circumstances warrant, a disciplinary form may be\n             completed.     In either event, all incidents shall be\n             documented.\n\n              Any offender behavior which constitutes criminal\n              behavior or a serious threat to the safety and order of\n              the employees, offenders, or property of an institution\n              shall be reported by the employee observing the\n              incident or to whom the situation has been reported if\n              observed by a non-employee.\n\n          2. Violations shall be reported on the Disciplinary Report\n             Form IN-V-36 F-1 and forwarded to the shift\n             supervisor for further review.\n\n       3IN-VI-21was replaced by IO-RD-01 effective April 2008. We do not consider\nwhether our analysis would be the same under the current policy.\n       4The disciplinary policy defines each of these offenses. However, for summary\njudgment purposes, we assume, without deciding, that during the breakfast turn out\none or more of these offenses occurred.\n\f                                    14\n\n      ....\n\n      4. Disciplinary reports are to be promptly forwarded to the\n         shift supervisor or designate official . . . .\n\n      5. Shift supervisor . . . shall make an initial determination of\n         the status of the offender pending disciplinary\n         procedures. If necessary for the safety and security of\n         staff and other offenders, the offender may be assigned to\n         administrative segregation.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n      Walker acknowledges the policy provides that if an officer\n\nencounters misconduct or a threatening situation, the officer may\n\nattempt to resolve the issue by directing the inmate to take corrective\n\naction, and that, if the corrective action is insufficient or circumstances\n\nwarrant, the officer may complete a disciplinary report. Such language\n\nrequires no mandatory action on the part of the officer and clearly allows\n\nfor an officer to use his or her discretion. See Dykstra v. U.S. Bureau of\n\nPrisons, 140 F.3d 791, 795 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding prison policy did not\n\nrequire prison counselor to warn inmate that his youthful appearance\n\nmade him vulnerable to attack prior to obtaining waiver of protective\n\ncustody); Calderon, 123 F.3d at 949 (finding prison disciplinary\n\nregulation, which allowed staff to consider informal resolution of an\n\nincident gave prison personnel room for judgment in determining\n\nwhether to sanction an inmate).       Officer Walston did, in fact, take\n\ncorrective action by talking to the inmates and inquiring what the\n\nproblem was. At various points, he instructed inmates to return to their\n\ncells or units.\n\n      Walker asserts however, that the subsequent language in the\n\nregulation required Officer Walston to take further action under the\n\ncircumstances presented.      The regulation required Officer Walston to\n\nreport all incidents.   Moreover, it required criminal behavior or serious\n\f                                     15\n\nthreats to safety to be reported on a disciplinary form and promptly\n\nforwarded to the shift supervisor.        The shift supervisor would then\n\ndetermine whether it was necessary for the safety and security of staff\n\nand other offenders that the offender be assigned to administrative\n\nsegregation. Walker alleges Officer Walston was aware, after overhearing\n\nthe threats of assault and confronting Humphrey and Barnett, that the\n\ninmates were anticipating a fight.          Walker argues, under these\n\ncircumstances, the regulation required Officer Walston to make a prompt\n\nreport to his supervisor, who would then make the determination\n\nwhether there was credible evidence that an inmate may be in physical\n\ndanger and impose administrative segregation.\n      The State disputes Walker’s interpretation of the regulation.\nAlthough the regulation requires documentation of misconduct or a\nthreatening situation, the State asserts the policy does not mandate the\ntype, timing, or manner of documentation.        Those matters, the State\ncontends, are subject to staff discretion.     Moreover, assuming Officer\nWalston was required to document the verbal altercation, he did so later\nin the day.     Similarly, while the regulation also requires that criminal\nbehavior or a serious threat to the safety and order of an institution shall\nbe reported, the State contends there is no policy or rule for determining\nwhen conduct rises to the level of criminal behavior or a serious threat,\nand therefore, it was a judgment call best left to the discretion of the\nprison staff.    In support, the State relies on the affidavit of Associate\nWarden/Security at CCF, Jim Payne.          In addressing the policies and\nprocedures regarding inmate violations, Associate Warden Payne stated:\n            3. There is no written policy or procedure mandating\n      that when a correctional officer or other staff member\n      observes an inmate violating a minor or major rule that an\n      inmate disciplinary report be completed or that the inmate\n      be referred to the shift captain for segregation and lock up.\n\f                                    16\n            4. To the contrary the Correctional Officer or the staff\n      member is encouraged by written policy and procedure and\n      also through training, to attempt other less drastic corrective\n      action when possible.\n             5. The Correctional Officer or staff member must\n      make a decision based on judgment on what corrective\n      action is appropriate for the situation or event. Proper\n      corrective action can include anything from making your\n      presence known, to talking with the inmate, to a verbal\n      warning, to referring the matter to a shift manager to\n      consider segregation or lock up, or sending the inmates to\n      their cells.\n\nThe State also argues that there was no criminal behavior or serious\n\nthreat to the safety and order of the institution after Officer Walston\n\nspoke with the inmates. The State asserts the regulation requires the\n\nexercise of judgment and discretion similar to that found in Calderon.\n\n      In Calderon, a federal prison inmate informed prison personnel of\n\nthreats he had received from another inmate, Perez. 123 F.3d at 948.\n\nFederal prison disciplinary regulations provided that “ ‘[s]taff shall take\n\ndisciplinary action at such times and to the degree necessary to regulate\n\nan inmate’s behavior within the Bureau rules and institution guidelines\n\nand to promote a safe and orderly institution environment.’ ” Id. at 949\n\n(quoting 28 C.F.R. § 541.10(b)(2)).       The regulations further defined\n“ ‘[t]hreatening another with bodily harm or any other offense’ ” as a\n\nprohibited act for which disciplinary action must be taken. Id. (quoting\n\n28 C.F.R. § 541.13). The same regulations also required that\n      “when [the] staff witnesses or has reasonable belief that a\n      violation of [prison] regulations has been committed by an\n      inmate, and when staff considers informal resolution of the\n      incident inappropriate or unsuccessful, staff shall prepare\n      an Incident Report and promptly forward it to the\n      appropriate [supervisor].”\n\nId. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 541.14(a)).     Prison personnel took no steps to\n\nprotect Calderon or to discipline Perez, who eventually attacked and\n\f                                           17\n\nseriously injured Calderon.         Id. at 948.     The government claimed the\n\ndecision not to separate Calderon and Perez involved a discretionary act\n\nand therefore liability was barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(FTCA). Id.\n\n       In   reviewing    the    federal    regulations      for   addressing   inmate\n\nmisconduct, the court found that none of the cited regulations set forth\n\nany mandatory, nondiscretionary disciplinary action that required prison\n\npersonnel to take specific action against Perez prior to his attack on\n\nCalderon.     Id. at 949–50.       First, the regulations did not specify any\n\nparticular type of action personnel are required to take with respect to\n\ninmate discipline. Second, while section 541.14 may require an incident\n\nreport, which might ultimately lead to the imposition of a sanction, the\n\ncourt noted that such action was only required when (1) prison personnel\n\nwitness or have a reasonable belief that a violation has occurred, and\n\n(2) when staff considers informal resolution inappropriate.                  Calderon\n\npresented no evidence that prison personnel witnessed any violation of\n\nprison regulations or made any formal finding that Perez had actually\n\ncommitted any prohibited acts. Id. at 950. The court, therefore, found\n\nthe   regulations     clearly   gave      the   prison     personnel   discretion    in\n\ndetermining whether to sanction Perez. 5             Id.    The court also rejected\n\n         5The Seventh Circuit also rejected the defendant’s argument that the\n“reasonable belief” standard should be interpreted as “when a reasonable staff person\nwould have had a belief that a violation occurred.” Calderon, 123 F.3d at 950 n.1. It\nconcluded that if the discretionary function exception could be pierced by a showing of\nnegligence, then it was no shield at all. Id. In Parrott v. United States, 536 F.3d 629,\n637 (7th Cir. 2008), the Seventh Circuit held that while 18 U.S.C. § 4042 provided a\nmandatory duty of care, it did not provide the manner by which that duty was to be\nfulfilled. However, it continued, an inmate was only required to show that the prison\nstaff knew or reasonably should have known of a potential problem between two\ninmates, seemingly a step away from Calderon. Parrott, 536 F.3d at 637. The appellate\ncourt concluded that the district court made no findings about what the prison official\nshould have known about the risks of placing Parrott in the same work detail as\nanother inmate and that this might be enough to warrant a remand on Parrott’s failure-\nto-protect claim. In the end, however, the decision to remand was due to disputed\n\f                                         18\n\nCalderon’s argument that 18 U.S.C. § 4042, which provides the Bureau\n\nof Prisons “shall . . . provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of\n\nall persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United\n\nStates,” required any mandatory action of the prison personnel. Id. at\n\n950.\n\n       The State’s reliance on Calderon is misplaced.            In Calderon, the\n\nstatute required action and a report when (1) a violation was witnessed\n\nor when a reasonable belief that a regulation violation had occurred and\n\n(2) prison personnel determined informal resolution was inappropriate or\n\nunsuccessful.     Id. at 949.    In Calderon, the court found there was no\n\nevidence that prison personnel witnessed any violation of prison\n\nregulations or made any formal finding that Perez had actually\n\ncommitted any of the prohibited acts.          Id. at 950. Here, however, the\n\nregulations required\n       [a]ny offender behavior which constitutes criminal behavior\n       or a serious threat to the safety and order of the employees,\n       offenders, or property of an institution shall be reported . . .\n       on the Disciplinary Report Form IN-V-36 F-1 and [promptly]\n       forwarded to the shift supervisor . . . [who] shall make an\n       initial determination of the status of the offender pending\n       disciplinary procedures . . . [and] if necessary for the safety\n       and security of staff and other offenders, the offender may be\n       assigned to administrative segregation.\n\n       We agree with the State that while the regulation provides\ndiscretion as to the reporting and handling of “misconduct or a\nthreatening situation,” with respect to “criminal behavior or a serious\nthreat,” the regulation requires the officer to promptly report to the shift\nsupervisor.      Pursuant to Policy IN-VI-21, assault is defined as\n“intentionally caus[ing] or threaten[ing] to cause injury to another\n__________________________\nissues of material fact as to whether the contents of a previously entered separation\norder left prison personnel without discretion to keep Parrott and the other inmate\nseparate. Id. at 637–38.\n\f                                    19\n\nperson,” and is categorized as a major offense under the disciplinary\nregulations.    “Promptly” means “immediately” or “quickly”.     Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1816 (unabr. ed. 2002) [hereinafter\nWebster’s].     However, because at this stage the material facts are\ndisputed, we are unable to determine whether, for example, an assault,\nwhich by definition constitutes criminal behavior, occurred and would,\nunder the circumstances, constitute a serious threat. Because material\nfacts are at issue, i.e., whether Officer Walston overheard threats of\nassault and preparation for a fight during the exercise turn out, it is not\npossible to determine whether the regulation required Officer Walston to\nprepare a report, which must then be promptly forwarded to the shift\nsupervisor for review and consideration of any potential additional safety\nmeasures.      See Ashford v. United States, 511 F.3d 501, 505 (5th Cir.\n2007) (holding summary judgment improper where inmate claimed he\nraised safety concerns during intake interview which would, under\nprison policy, have required him to be put in solitary confinement until\nan investigation could be conducted); see also Schneider v. State, 789\nN.W.2d 138, 146–47 (Iowa 2010) (holding the discretionary function\ndoctrine had no application because the State had no discretion in\ndetermining whether the bridge could be designed and built to encroach\non a floodway).\n      3. Was the discretion susceptible to policy-related judgments?\nNevertheless, even if we conclude none of the policy provisions discussed\nrequired mandatory action by prison personnel, we conclude the\ndiscretionary function exception is not applicable in this case because\nthe decisions by prison staff in the supervision of the inmates did not\ninvolve the evaluation of broad public policy factors.          Individual\njudgments protected by the discretionary function exception must be\n\f                                    20\n\nbased on considerations of public policy. Anderson, 692 N.W.2d at 364.\nThe record must show\n      the governmental entity based its actions on the required\n      policy considerations, as distinguished from an action\n      arising out of the day-to-day activities of the business of\n      government. Unless a governmental entity can demonstrate\n      that when it exercised its judgment, it genuinely could have\n      considered and balanced factors supported by social,\n      economic, or political policies, we will not recognize the\n      discretionary function immunity.\n\nId. at 366.\n      In other words, an immune governmental action is one that\n      weighs competing ideals in order to promote those concerns\n      of paramount importance over the less essential, opposing\n      values. Whether or not the [governmental actor] actually\n      made its decision with policy considerations in mind is not\n      determinative. Instead, the [governmental entity’s] actions\n      . . . must be amenable to a policy-based analysis. The\n      circumstances must show the [entity] legitimately could have\n      considered social, economic, or political policies when\n      making judgments as to [the supervision of prison inmates].\n\nGraber v. City of Ankeny, 656 N.W.2d 157, 165 (Iowa 2003).\n      The State argues the evidence supports the conclusion correctional\nstaff, in supervising the inmates and addressing inmate behavior, could\nhave considered social and economic policies.       Specifically, the State\nnotes the legislature has granted the IDOC statutory authority to create\ndisciplinary procedures and adopt rules pertaining to the internal\nmanagement of penal institutions within the state.         See Iowa Code\n§§ 904.108(1)(a), (k); .205. Under these rules, staff is given discretion in\nthe application of corrective action and the reporting of rule violations.\nIn his affidavit, Associate Warden Payne maintained such discretion is\nnecessary because rule violation is very common in prison. If every rule\nviolation resulted in a disciplinary report or segregation, he asserted, the\ncorrectional staff would be unable to perform their job, which would\nresult in the deterioration of the safe and efficient operation of the\n\f                                     21\n\nfacility.   It would require more staff to be hired, an economic\nconsideration. Moreover, the increased disciplinary action and lock ups\nwould produce inmate dissatisfaction and frustration, resulting in\nthreats to the safe and efficient operation of the facility. The State argues\nthis case is similar to and governed by our analysis in Anderson.\n       In Anderson, the plaintiff brought a premise liability claim,\nasserting the State was negligent for failing to close the university library\ndue to inclement weather. 692 N.W.2d at 361. The evidence established\nthe university had a written policy concerning operations during adverse\nweather.    Id. at 362.   In deciding whether the discretionary function\nexception applied to the dean’s decision not to close the library early, we\nconsidered our application of the discretionary function exception in\nother cases.   In cases where we held the exception inapplicable, the\nrecord showed the governmental entity did not base its action on\nrequired policy considerations, but rather the action arose out of the day-\nto-day activities of the business of government.      Id. at 364–66 (citing\nMadden, 661 N.W.2d at 139–40 (holding building inspector’s decision not\nto inspect dry wall was ad hoc and there was no evidence to suggest\nengagement in policy analysis); Ette, 656 N.W.2d at 69 (holding school’s\ndecision to send student home alone on bus was not a judgment call\ndriven by social, economic, or political concerns); Messerschmidt v. City\nof Sioux City, 654 N.W.2d 879, 881 (Iowa 2002) (holding decision to\nremove a road barricade did not involve policy-making decisions and city\nhad “not met its burden to prove considerations based on social,\neconomic, or political policy were involved in its decision”); Doe, 652\nN.W.2d at 444–45 (holding school failed to show any social, political, or\neconomic factors as basis for decision to hire, retain, and supervise a\nparticular teacher); Bellman v. City of Cedar Falls, 617 N.W.2d 11, 19\n(Iowa 2000) (holding teacher’s decision in supervising children was not\n\f                                           22\n\nbased    upon     policy     considerations)).     We     held   that    “[u]nless    a\ngovernmental entity can demonstrate that when it exercised its\njudgment, it genuinely could have considered and balanced factors\nsupported by social, economic, or political policies, we will not recognize\nthe discretionary function immunity.”             Id. at 366 (citing Graber, 656\nN.W.2d at 165).\n        Applying this test to the facts, in Anderson we found the dean\nconsidered and balanced the same factors used by the university when it\nformulated the policy: providing the maximum opportunity for students\nand staff to utilize the library, thus furthering the public policy of\nproviding the best college education at a reasonable cost, against the\nadequacy of the staff and the number of persons using the library\nfacilities.     Id.        Because   the   dean   could    balance      these   policy\nconsiderations        in   making    her   determination,    we    concluded         the\ndiscretionary function exception applied.\n        Here, we conclude the discretionary function exception is not\napplicable because the decisions made by the correctional staff in the\nsupervision of the inmates did not involve the evaluation of broad public\npolicy factors.       The correctional staffs’ handling of the confrontation\nduring the breakfast turn out and their supervision of the inmates\nduring the exercise turn out was not the product of a judgment call\ndriven by legitimate social, economic, or political concerns. As we held in\nMadden,\n               While most governmental actions involve some degree\n        of discretion, only those choices based upon the “meaningful\n        exercise of discretion” are immune from liability. The critical\n        distinction “is the one between a judgment that embodies a\n        professional assessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of\n        settled priorities and a fully discretionary judgment that\n        balances incommensurable values in order to establish those\n        priorities.” An immune government function is “one that\n        weighs competing ideals in order to promote those concerns\n\f                                    23\n      of paramount importance over the less essential, opposing\n      values.”\n\n661 N.W.2d at 139 (quoting Graber, 656 N.W.2d at 164–65). There is no\nevidence that, in their supervision of the inmates, the correctional staff\ncould have or did weigh competing ideals or balance incommensurable\nvalues to promote those concerns of paramount importance. Rather, as\nin Madden, the actions of the correctional staff “embod[ied] a professional\nassessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of settled priorities.” Id.\n      The decisions made by Officer Walston in handling the situation\nthat unfolded during the breakfast turn out and the activity specialists’\nsupervision of the inmates in the gym during the exercise turn out were\nad hoc decisions.   See Webster’s at 26 (defining “ad hoc” as “made,\nestablished, acting, or concerned with a particular end or purpose” and\n“without reference to wider application”). There is nothing in the record\nto suggest that in performing their duties, the correctional staff could\nhave weighed competing ideals in order to determine how to supervise\nthe inmates.\n      We acknowledge the State’s reliance on several federal cases in\n\nwhich the federal courts found the discretionary function exception\n\napplicable against claims prison officials were negligent in failing to\n\nprotect inmates. See, e.g., Santana-Rosa v. United States, 335 F.3d 39,\n\n43–44 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding prison’s decisions regarding maintenance\n\nof cleaning supplies and inmate work assignments are susceptible to\n\npolicy-related analysis and therefore inmate’s FTCA claim for failure to\n\nprotect him from other inmate was held to fall within the discretionary\n\nfunction exception); Cohan, 151 F.3d at 1344 (holding discretionary\n\nfunction exception shielded federal prisoner’s claim asserting Bureau of\n\nPrisons negligently assigned his attacker to a minimum security prison\n\non the basis that “[d]eciding how to classify prisoners and choosing the\n\f                                      24\n\ninstitution in which to place them are part and parcel of the inherently\n\npolicy-laden endeavor of maintaining order and preserving security\n\nwithin our nation’s prisons”); Calderon, 123 F.3d at 950 (holding that\n\nwhen the inmate has presented no evidence the prison officials witnessed\n\nany violation of prison regulations the actions are presumed grounded in\n\npublic policy and the discretionary function exception applies); Dykstra,\n\n140   F.3d   at   795–96   (holding   “[w]hen   established   policy   allows\n\ngovernmental agents to exercise discretion, ‘it must be presumed that the\n\nagent’s acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion’ ” to\n\ndismiss inmate’s claim prison staff was negligent in failing to warn him\n\nhis youthful appearance put him at risk of harm before he waived his\n\noption to be placed in protective custody (quoting United States v.\n\nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324, 111 S. Ct. 1267, 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d 335,\n\n348 (1991))); Buchanan v. United States, 915 F.2d 969, 972 (5th Cir.\n\n1990) (where prison officials and staff considered the potential for\n\nviolence in response to the announcement of the Cuban repatriation\n\nagreement before deciding transferring the American prisoners would\n\nheighten the tension and create greater fear among Cuban detainees and\n\nthat a lock-down would be extremely difficult and possibly counter-\n\nproductive, discretionary function exception applicable because prison\n\nofficials could and did consider and balance factors supported by social,\n\neconomic, or political policies); see also Feltes v.

Therefore, we find it helpful to consider\n\nGaubert and its analysis.\n\n      In Gaubert, a shareholder of an insolvent savings and loan\n\nassociation brought an action against the United States under the FTCA.\n\n499 U.S. at 320, 111 S. Ct. at 1272, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 345. After the\n\nsavings and loan went into receivership, the shareholder alleged\n\nnegligence of federal officers and directors in selecting the new officers\n\nand directors and in participating in the day-to-day management of the\n\nsavings and loan.     Id.   The district court granted the government’s\n\nmotion to dismiss, holding all of the challenged actions fell within the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to the FTCA. Id. The Supreme Court\n\ngranted certiorari.\n\n      In applying the second prong of the Berkovitz test, the Court noted:\n            Where Congress has delegated the authority to an\n      independent agency or to the Executive Branch to implement\n      the general provisions of a regulatory statute and to issue\n      regulations to that end, there is no doubt that planning-level\n      decision establishing programs are protected by the\n      discretionary function exception, as is the promulgation of\n      regulations by which the agencies are to carry out the\n      programs. . . . [T]he actions of Government agents involving\n      the necessary element of choice and grounded in the social,\n      economic, or political goals of the statute and regulations are\n      protected.\n\nId. at 323, 111 S. Ct. at 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 347. Summarizing the\n\napplication of the test, the Court held:\n      [I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the\n      employee obeys the direction, the Government will be\n      protected because the action will be deemed in furtherance\n      of the policies which led to the promulgation of the\n      regulation.      If the employee violates the mandatory\n      regulation, there will be no shelter from liability because\n      there is no room for choice and the action will be contrary to\n      policy. On the other hand, if a regulation allows the employee\n      discretion, the very existence of the regulation creates a strong\n      presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the\n\f                                    26\n      regulation involves consideration of the same policies which\n      led to the promulgation of the regulations.\n\nId. at 324, 111 S. Ct. at 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 347 (emphasis added)\n\n(citation omitted). Thus, Gaubert held that\n      [w]hen established governmental policy . . . allows a\n      Government agent to exercise discretion, it must be\n      presumed that the agent’s acts are grounded in policy when\n      exercising that discretion. For a complaint to survive a\n      motion to dismiss, it must allege facts which would support\n      a finding that the challenged actions are not the kind of\n      conduct that can be said to be grounded in the policy of the\n      regulatory scheme.\n\nId. at 324–25, 111 S. Ct. at 1274–75, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 348. The Court\n\nheld that the focus was not on the subjective intent of the agent\n\nexercising the discretion conferred by the regulation, but rather on the\n\nnature of the actions taken and their susceptibility to policy analysis.\n\nThus, there is a presumption that discretionary acts performed pursuant\n\nto relevant policies, including those performed in the day-to-day\n\noperations, are entitled to the exemption. Id. at 332–33, 111 S. Ct. at\n\n1278–79, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 352–53.\n\n      Although concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia wrote\n\nseparately to voice his disagreement with the analysis employed by the\n\nmajority. Id. at 334, 111 S. Ct. at 1280, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 354 (Scalia, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).        In his concurrence,\n\nJustice Scalia examines the oft times confusing application of the second\n\nportion of the two-prong Berkovitz test.      Noting that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception to the FTCA does not protect all governmental\n\nactivities involving choice, Justice Scalia observed that the choice “must\n\nrepresent a ‘policy judgment.’ ”    Id. at 335, 111 S. Ct. at 1280, 113\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 354.   While acknowledging that the planning/operational\n\ndichotomy is wrong, Justice Scalia nevertheless argued “that the level at\n\f                                      27\n\nwhich the decision is made is often relevant to the discretionary function\n\ninquiry, since the answer to that inquiry turns on both the subject\n\nmatter and the office of the decisionmaker.”             Id. at 335, 111 S. Ct. at\n\n1280, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 355.        In his view, a discretionary choice was\n\nshielded from liability only “if the choice is, under the particular\n\ncircumstances, one that ought to be informed by considerations of social,\n\neconomic, or political policy and is made by an officer whose official\n\nresponsibilities   include   assessment       of    those   considerations.”    Id.\n\n(emphasis added) (noting, as an example, the dock foreman’s decision to\n\ncompactly store bags of fertilizer would not be protected, even if he\n\ncalculated cost versus safety, because it was not his responsibility to\n\nponder such things).\n\n       We note Gaubert involved a motion to dismiss and the presumption\n\nthat when there is an established governmental policy that allows for\n\ndiscretion, “it must be presumed that the agent’s acts are grounded in\n\npolicy when exercising that discretion.” Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 324, 111\n\nS. Ct. at 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 348. Although we have previously cited\n\nGaubert, see Goodman, 587 N.W.2d at 238; Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at\n\n147, it does not appear that we have adopted this presumption, but\n\nrather our analysis in our prior discretionary function cases are more in\n\nline   with   Justice   Scalia’s   analysis        in   determining   whether   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception is applicable.               See Anderson, 692\n\nN.W.2d at 366 (finding dean’s decision not to close library during\n\ninclement weather could be and was based upon a balancing of public\n\npolicy factors); Madden, 661 N.W.2d at 140 (during performance of a\n\nroutine duty “public official did not weigh any broad-sweeping policies\n\nbefore he decided not to perform a required inspection”); Ette, 656\n\nN.W.2d at 69 (holding supervision of students “is not . . . driven by\n\f                                    28\n\npublic policy implications uniquely within the purview of school officials\n\nand employees”); Messerschmidt, 654 N.W.2d at 883 (“Matters such as\n\nwhen to lift a temporary road barricade do not require evaluation of\n\npolicies but instead involved implementation of everyday decisions\n\nroutinely made by the city.”); Doe, 652 N.W.2d at 445 (noting that it is\n\npossible to articulate some notion of policy considerations involved in\n\nany decision but that the administrative act of hiring, retaining, and\n\nsupervising an individual teacher does not involve the careful balancing\n\nof competing interests, risks, and advantages, and does not elevate such\n\ndecision to the level of economic, political, or social policymaking);\n\nBellman, 617 N.W.2d at 19 (holding while a teacher’s supervisory duties\n\ninvolve matters of judgment, policy considerations are not involved in the\n\ndecisions made by a teacher in supervising her class); see also Butler ex\n\nrel. Biller v. Bayer, 168 P.3d 1055, 1067 (Nev. 2007) (holding decision to\n\nparole inmate requires analysis of multiple social, economic, efficiency,\n\nand planning concerns, but the actions of effectuating inmate’s\n\npostparole placement, while it may have required the exercise of some\n\njudgment or choice, were not actions based on the consideration of any\n\nsocial, economic, or political policy); Martinez v. Maruszczak, 168 P.3d\n\n720, 729 (Nev. 2007) (applying Berkovitz-Gaubert test in medical\n\nmalpractice case and clarifying that decisions at all levels of government,\n\nincluding frequent or routine decisions, may be protected by the\n\ndiscretionary act exception, but only if the decisions require analysis of\n\ngovernment policy concerns).\n\n      Because we have concluded the decisions made by the correctional\n\nstaff in the supervision of the inmates, in this instance, did not involve\n\nthe evaluation of broad public policy factors, we necessarily conclude the\n\nState is not entitled to the discretionary function exception and the\n\f                                    29\n\ndistrict court did not err in denying the State’s motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n      C. Intentional Tort Exception.       The State also claims another\n\nsection of the ITCA bars Walker’s claim. The section provides:\n\n            The provisions of this chapter shall not apply with\n      respect to any claim against the state, to:\n\n             4. Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false\n      imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of\n      process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or\n      interference with contract rights.\n\nIowa Code § 669.14(4).     The legislature intended the ITCA to have the\n\nsame effect as the FTCA. Feltes, 385 N.W.2d at 547. Thus, we give great\n\nweight to relevant federal decisions interpreting the Federal Act. Id.\n\n      The FTCA provides:\n\n             The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of\n      this title shall not apply to—\n\n            ....\n\n             (h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false\n      imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of\n      process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or\n      interference with contract rights: Provided, That, with regard\n      to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement\n      officers of the United States Government, the provisions of\n      this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall apply to\n      any claim arising, on or after the date of the enactment of\n      this proviso, out of assault, battery, false imprisonment,\n      false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2680 (2006). These provisions are commonly referred to as\n\nthe intentional tort exceptions to the Act. Sheridan v. United States, 487\n\nU.S. 392, 394, 108 S. Ct. 2449, 2451, 101 L. Ed. 2d 352, 358 (1988).\n\n      The Supreme Court has examined this issue in two cases involving\n\nnegligence claims against government when an assault caused the\n\ninjuries to the claimant. See Sheridan, 487 U.S. at 393–94, 108 S. Ct. at\n\f                                     30\n\n2451, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 358 (involving an assault on a civilian by an off-\n\nduty serviceman); Muniz, 374 U.S. at 152, 83 S. Ct. at 1852, 10 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 809 (involving an assault on a prisoner by other prisoners). In Muniz,\n\nthe Supreme Court relied on Panella v. United States, 216 F.2d 622 (2d\n\nCir. 1954).     In Panella, the court narrowly construed the FTCA and\n\nlimited its application to claims arising from intentional torts by\n\ngovernment employees. Id. at 624–25. The Panella decision is founded\n\non the principle that the essence of the claim against the government is\n\nthe negligence of their employees, not the assault. Id. at 624. To hold\n\notherwise would exonerate the government from all liability where the\n\ninjuries to the claimant were caused by an assault. Id.\n\n         Adopting the analysis in Panella and citing the holding in Muniz,\n\nthe Supreme Court limited the intentional tort exception to cases arising\n\nout of assaults by federal employees. Sheridan, 487 U.S. at 398–400,\n\n108 S. Ct. at 2454–55, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 360–62. Although we have not\n\ndecided this issue under the ITCA, we find Panella, Muniz, and Sheridan\n\nare persuasive.\n\n         The basis of Walker’s claim is not that an employee of the State\n\ninflicted an intentional tort, but rather the State was negligent in failing\n\nto protect him from an assault by another prisoner. The whole purpose\n\nof the ITCA is to waive sovereign immunity for the negligent acts of the\n\nState.     To limit the State’s liability whenever an assault causes the\n\nclaimant’s damages would relieve the State of its liability for its negligent\n\nacts. This construction of the intentional tort exception is contrary to\n\nthe intent of the legislature when it enacted the ITCA.       In construing\n\nstatutes, we are required to determine legislative intent.          Auen v.\n\nAlcoholic Beverages Div., 679 N.W.2d 586, 590 (Iowa 2004). As long as\n\nthe claimant can show the State is negligent in performing a duty to\n\f                                      31\n\nprotect a person from an assault, the intentional tort exception is not\n\napplicable.   Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s ruling on the\n\nintentional tort exception.\n\n      IV. Disposition.\n\n      We find discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions to\n\nthe ITCA do not apply under the facts of this case. Therefore, we hold\n\nthe district court was correct in denying the State’s motion for summary\n\njudgment.     Thus, we affirm the judgment of the district court and\n\nremand this case for trial.\n\n      AFFIRMED AND CASE REMANDED.\n\n      All justices concur except Waterman and Mansfield, JJ., who\n\nconcur in part and dissent in part.\n\f                                    32\n\n                                                #09–0663, Walker v. State\n\nMANSFIELD, Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I concur in part and dissent in part.     I would find that Officer\n\nWalston’s response to the “verbal altercation” involved an exercise of\n\ndiscretion for which the State is immune from suit under Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14(1) (2005).\n\n      First, I believe the facts are clear that prison regulations gave\n\nOfficer Walston discretion in responding to the prisoner argument that\n\noccurred during the breakfast turnout. As noted by the majority, Kevin\n\nWalker criticizes Officer Walston’s job performance in six different ways.\n\nHowever, the majority can point to only one area in which Walker\n\nconceivably did not have discretion, that is, the requirement that “a\n\nserious threat to the safety and order of the employees, offenders, or\n\nproperty of an institution shall be reported by the employee observing the\n\nincident.” But even here, the majority notes that Walker did file a report,\n\nand the regulations do not state how promptly a report has to be filed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in this instance, the report concerning the incident did\n\nnot get filed before Walker was struck in the gym around 8:15 a.m. the\n\nsame morning. In short, this part of the litigation involved an effort to\n\nsecond-guess a correctional officer’s exercise of judgment.\n\n      Having found that Officer Walston was exercising discretion in how\n\nhe managed this inmate-to-inmate confrontation, I would find the State\n\nimmune from suit relating to his acts or omissions. I see no reason why\n\nIowa’s discretionary function exception cannot apply to “decisions made\n\nby the correctional staff in the supervision of inmates.”      Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14(1) is generally worded.     It provides the State shall be\n\nimmune from tort liability “based upon the exercise or performance or\n\nthe failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the\n\f                                    33\n\npart of a state agency or an employee of the state, whether or not the\n\ndiscretion be abused.” Iowa Code § 669.14(1). Thus, under the statute,\n\nthe individual exercising discretion can be any state “employee,”\n\nincluding someone performing the difficult and demanding job of a\n\ncorrectional officer.\n\n      Iowa Code section 669.14(1) is directly modeled after the\n\ndiscretionary function exception in the Federal Tort Claims Act. See 28\n\nU.S.C.A. § 2680(a) (West, Westlaw through P.L. 112–24 approved July\n\n26, 2011). As noted by the majority, there are many federal precedents\n\napplying the federal discretionary function exception to claims brought\n\nby prison inmates against prison staff.\n\n             The great weight of the case law suggests that if a\n      decision regarding the protection, safety, and classification of\n      prisoners is discretionary (i.e., there are no mandatory\n      directives), then such a decision is grounded in public policy\n      and the discretionary function exception applies.\n\nSledge v. United States, 723 F. Supp. 2d 87, 96–97 (D. D.C. 2010) (citing\n\nnumerous cases).\n\n      This outcome follows from the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 111 S. Ct. 1267, 113\n\nL. Ed. 2d 335 (1991). There, the Supreme Court held that, if a regulatory\n\nscheme affords discretion and the challenged actions can be said to be\n\ngrounded in the policy of the regulatory scheme, the discretionary\n\nfunction exception applies. Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 324–25, 111 S. Ct. at\n\n1274–75, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 347–48. The nature of the conduct, rather\n\nthan the status of the actor, governs whether the exception applies. Id.\n\nat 322, 111 S. Ct. at 1273, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 346. Thus, for example, if a\n\nregulation allows for discretion in responding to a specific prison\n\nsituation and the prison official’s response can be said to be related to\n\f                                    34\n\nlegitimate prison policy considerations, the discretionary exception\n\nfunction applies and the government is immune from suit. If this case\n\nwere in federal court concerning an incident that occurred in federal\n\nprison, I have little doubt that Walker would be unable to sue over\n\nOfficer Walston’s alleged acts and omissions.\n\n      Today’s   decision,   however,     limits   the   availability   of   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to situations in which the decision\n\ninvolved the actual “evaluation of broad public policy factors” or the\n\n“weigh[ing of] competing ideals.”   This approach effectively transforms\n\nthe discretionary function exception into an elites-only exemption.\n\nCorrectional officers are not such an elite. They perform a dangerous,\n\nstressful, but nonetheless discretion-filled job that does not allow them\n\nthe luxury of pondering broad public policy implications or weighing\n\ncompeting ideals.\n\n      I think Gaubert is a sensible construction of the statutory language\n\nand ought to be the rule in Iowa. In Goodman v. City of Le Claire, 587\n\nN.W.2d 232, 238 (Iowa 1998), our court endorsed the Gaubert standard.\n\nWe expressly disavowed earlier case law “holding that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception does not reach any decisions made at the operational\n\nlevel,” such as prison guards. Goodman, 587 N.W.2d at 238.\n\n      Just last year, we reiterated the importance of federal precedent in\n\nthis area. We said, “As the immunity for discretionary functions in our\n\nstatute has its genesis in the federal tort claims act, we have been guided\n\nby federal decisions applying the doctrine.”       Schneider v. State, 789\n\nN.W.2d 138, 146 (Iowa 2010). We have made similar statements before\n\nmany times. See, e.g., Ette ex rel. Ette v. Linn-Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 656\n\nN.W.2d 62, 67 (Iowa 2002) (“Because the discretionary function\n\nexception has its genesis in the federal tort claims act, we have been\n\f                                     35\n\nguided by federal decisions applying its mandate.”); Shelton v. State, 644\n\nN.W.2d 27, 30 (Iowa 2002) (“The Tort Claims Act is especially appropriate\n\nfor applying the sometimes criticized but familiar rule that we are guided\n\nby federal decisions interpreting federal statutes on which our own\n\nstatutes are modeled.”); Goodman, 587 N.W.2d at 236 (“We have\n\nrecognized that the legislature intended the Iowa State Tort Claims Act to\n\nhave the same effect as the Federal Tort Claims Act because the Iowa act\n\nis modeled after the federal act.    For this reason, we have given great\n\nweight to relevant federal decisions interpreting the federal act.”\n\n(Citation omitted.)); Butler v. State, 336 N.W.2d 416, 419 (Iowa 1983)\n\n(The   state   discretionary   function   exception   is    “identical    to   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act, and we\n\nare aided by federal interpretations of that provision.”                 (Citation\n\nomitted.)); see also Adam v. Mount Pleasant Bank & Trust Co., 340\n\nN.W.2d 251, 252 (Iowa 1983) (“Because our statute is based on the\n\nfederal Tort Claims Act, we assume our legislature intended it to have the\n\nsame meaning as the federal statute.”); Hubbard v. State, 163 N.W.2d\n\n904, 911 (Iowa 1969) (same).\n\n       I agree that in some decisions since Goodman we seem to have\n\nfollowed a non-Gaubertian approach to the discretionary function\n\nexception.     That approach, as the majority accurately explains, bears\n\nmore of a resemblance to Justice Scalia’s separate opinion in Gaubert.\n\nSee Anderson v. State, 692 N.W.2d 360, 366–67 (Iowa 2005); Madden v.\n\nCity of Eldridge, 661 N.W.2d 134, 139–40 (Iowa 2003); Graber v. City of\n\nAnkeny, 656 N.W.2d 157, 165–66 (Iowa 2003); Messerschmidt v. City of\n\nSioux City, 654 N.W.2d 879, 882–83 (Iowa 2002).            That approach also\n\narguably revives the concept that decisions made at the operational level\n\f                                     36\n\ncannot be subject to the discretionary function exception—a principle we\n\nsaid we were discarding in Goodman. 587 N.W.2d at 238.\n\n      Yet, in none of our prior cases have we said we were departing\n\nfrom Gaubert or overruling Goodman. I would not take that step today.\n\nRather, I would continue to follow Gaubert and Goodman and apply them\n\nto the prison conditions at issue in this case.\n\n      Accordingly, I would find that Officer Walston was exercising\n\nprison-related discretion when he allegedly did not take sufficient steps\n\nto protect Walker from a threat. Officer Walston’s testimony describes\n\nthe prison policy considerations that entered into his decisions:\n\n      [M]ost people, when they get loud in the middle of the day\n      room so it draws your attention to the problem, most\n      people—not all, as you say—are looking for an out. They’re\n      looking for the CO to become involved so they don’t have to\n      come to blows. That—that’s the way it works around here a\n      lot of times.\n\n            ....\n\n            They want you to get involved to say, hey, you need to\n      knock that off. There ain’t going to be any fighting here. I\n      got my eyes on you. I’m watching you. Don’t—don’t keep\n      going on. And that gives everybody an easy out. So they\n      don’t have to lose face to their peers inside here. . . .\n\n            ....\n\n            . . . [T]hat’s the first continuum of how you deal with\n      it. You approach them. It’s your presence. You talk to\n      them. You tell them. You see how it’s going to work out.\n      That’s how it progresses.\n\n            It doesn’t always start from one and go to like one,\n      two, three, four on a policy order in the way it’s presented.\n      Sometimes you have to skip over if it’s—if it’s turned about,\n      you have to go to a higher degree right off the bat, but on a\n      normal progression, it’s just like minor reports. You’d go\n      with them. You tell them not to do it. You give them a\n      verbal warning. You give them the written. Make them do a\n      responsibility report.\n\f                                     37\n            It all goes up the line unless they just don’t listen and\n      you have to go to a higher degree. You don’t want to start at\n      the top. You have to have somewhere to go.\n\n      Of course, even under my colleagues’ approach, the fact finder may\n\nwell decide that Officer Walston acted reasonably and thus reject\n\nWalker’s claim.    However, in adopting section 669.14(1), I believe the\n\nlegislature intended to provide an immunity for these kinds of judgment\n\ncalls by a correctional officer.\n\n      I agree with my colleagues’ conclusion that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception does not apply to Walker’s allegation that Activity\n\nSpecialists Bogdanski and Stipe failed to properly supervise the exercise\n\nturnout at which Walker was actually struck and injured.                 This\n\nallegation appears to involve garden-variety negligence rather than an\n\nexercise of prison-related discretion. I also agree that the intentional tort\n\nexception does not apply here and thus join part III. C. of the majority\n\nopinion.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n      Waterman, J., joins this concurrence in part and dissent in part.\n\f",

Walker brought a tort claim against the State, a correctional\n\nofficer, and two activity specialists, claiming they negligently failed to\n\nensure his safety. The State sought summary judgment based upon the\n\ndiscretionary function and intentional tort exceptions under Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14 (2005). The district court denied the State’s motion, and\n\nthe State filed an application for interlocutory appeal, which we granted.\n\nWe now affirm the decision of the district court denying the State’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Prior Proceedings.\n\n       The State acknowledges that some of the underlying facts in the\n\ncase are disputed, but it claims that it is entitled to summary judgment\n\nas a matter of law.         A reasonable fact finder viewing the summary\n\njudgment record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff could find the\n\nfollowing facts.\n\n       CCF is a medium-security correctional prison of the Iowa\n\nDepartment of Corrections (IDOC). On January 8, 2005, Kevin Walker,\n\nan inmate at CCF, had a confrontation with inmate Darrell Humphrey,\n\nduring the breakfast turn out. 1           According to Walker, Humphrey, a\n\njailhouse lawyer, approached another inmate, Willie Evans, who was\n\ninvolved in challenging a rules violation, and offered his services for a\n\nsmall fee. When Walker advised Evans that he could handle the matter\n\non his own, Humphrey became angry with Walker and threatened to\n\nassault him.        Evans then became angry with Humphrey and an\n\n       1“Turn  out” means designated times for inmates to move from their cells or other\nlocations to another in the institution such as the breakfast room or the gym.\n\f                                    3\n\nargument between the two ensued.        This argument continued as the\n\ngroup made its way through the breakfast line.\n\n      After going through the line, Humphrey sat at a different table from\n\nWalker, Evans, and another inmate, Edward Willingham.         As they ate\n\ntheir breakfast, Evans and Humphrey continued to argue, shouting and\n\nthreatening each other from their respective tables. According to Walker,\n\nthe argument was louder than any other conversation in the room\n\nbecause the inmates had stopped talking and were listening to the\n\nargument. Walker did not report the threats, but asserts Correctional\n\nOfficer Thomas Walston, who was staffing the breakfast turn out, could\n\nhear the argument, including the threats of assault.      Officer Walston\n\nclaims he could not hear the specifics of the conversation.     However,\n\nafter Humphrey left the unit, Officer Walston talked to the remaining\n\ninmates involved in the argument and asked them what the problem was\n\nand was told everything was fine.\n\n      A short time later, Humphrey returned to the unit with David\n\nBarnett. Barnett was in a different unit, and it was a rules violation for\n\nhim to return with Humphrey.        Evans and Willingham continued to\n\nargue with Barnett and Humphrey, with some pushing and shoving\n\ngoing on. Barnett indicated the argument would be settled at the next\n\nturn out, the exercise turn out. He indicated they could fight in the gym\n\nbecause the yard was too cold that day. Walker alleges Officer Walston\n\noverheard these statements.\n\n      At some point, Officer Walston approached the group and\n\ninstructed Barnett to return to his unit. He did not, however, instruct\n\nEvans, who was on cell restriction, to return to his cell. When Barnett\n\ndid not leave immediately, Officer Walston escorted him out of the unit\n\f                                        4\n\nduring which time Barnett made comments about settling the argument\n\nat the next turn out.\n\n      During the exercise turn out, Walker went to the gym and played\n\nbasketball with other inmates.        On the other side of the gym, Evans,\n\nHumphrey, and Barnett were fighting in a blind spot that could not be\n\nseen from the office in the gym. 2          When the fight was over, Barnett\n\nwalked over to Walker, and stated something to the effect, “[T]his is what\n\nhappens when you shoot your mouth off.” Humphrey then approached\n\nWalker and assaulted him.         The assault knocked Walker unconscious\n\nand broke his jaw.\n\n      At the time of the exercise turn out, two activity specialists, Noel\n\nBogdanski and Richard Stipe, were on duty in the gym. They did not see\n\nthe fight involving Evans, Barnett, and Humphrey, or the assault on\n\nWalker.    Bogdanski was in the office of the gym either handing out\n\nequipment or filling out paperwork. Stipe was standing in the door of the\n\ngym as the inmates entered and could not see the areas where the two\n\nincidents occurred. Both Bogdanski and Stipe were aware of the blind\n\nspot in the gym, but did not monitor the area. Officer Walston filled out\n\na disciplinary report regarding the breakfast incident, but not until after\n\nWalker was assaulted.\n\n      On August 3, 2006, Walker filed a tort claim, pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode chapter 669, against the State and the three correctional staff\n\nmembers, claiming injury and damages due to the defendants’ negligence\n\nin failing to exercise reasonable care to protect Walker from a violent\n\nattack by another prisoner.        On February 6, 2007, the State Appeal\n\nBoard denied Walker’s claim. Thereafter, Walker filed this petition.\n\n      2Officer  Walston allowed inmate Evans to attend the turn out, even though he\nwas on cell restriction and was not supposed to be able to go to the gym.\n\f                                     5\n\n      In his petition, Walker contends that (1) Bogdanski and Stipe were\n\nnegligent in failing to properly supervise the exercise turn out, (2) Officer\n\nWalston was negligent for failing to alert Bogdanski and Stipe about the\n\nmorning confrontations and the threats made about the fight, (3) all of\n\nthe defendants were negligent in failing to ensure the safety of Walker in\n\nlight of the dangerous situation that existed in the gym at the time\n\nWalker was injured, and (4) all the defendants were negligent for allowing\n\na dangerous condition to exist in the gym.         Pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.5(2)(a), the district court ordered the State substituted for\n\nthe individually named defendants Walston, Bogdanski, and Stipe. See\n\nIowa Code § 669.5(2)(a) (2007) (substituting the state for defendant\n\nwhere defendant in a suit was an employee of the state acting within the\n\nscope of the employee’s employment at the time of the incident upon\n\nwhich the claim is based).      Thereafter, the State filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment asserting the State was entitled to immunity\n\npursuant to the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions\n\nunder Iowa Code section 669.14 (2005).\n\n      The State contended the policies of the IDOC permit prison staff to\n\nuse discretion in taking corrective action in the management of inmate\n\npopulations and in monitoring and supervising inmates, and therefore,\n\nthe correctional staffs’ actions are entitled to discretionary function\n\nexception under Iowa Code section 669.14(1). The State also asserted it\n\nis immune from any claim arising from an assault pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14(4).\n\n      The district court denied the State’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, concluding a genuine issue of material fact existed as to\n\nwhether the prison staff involved had knowledge of hostility or a history\n\nof prior trouble involving Walker. It did not explicitly address the State’s\n\f                                        6\n\ncontention that, as a matter of law, the discretionary function or\n\nintentional tort exceptions applied.           The State filed a motion to\n\nreconsider, which the district court overruled.        We granted the State’s\n\napplication   for    interlocutory    appeal    to   determine   whether   the\n\ndiscretionary function and intentional tort exceptions apply in this case.\n\n      II.

Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536, 108 S. Ct. at 1958, 100 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 540.   The discretionary function exception is inapplicable when a\n\nstatute, regulation, or policy requires a course of action for an employee\n\nto follow. Id. Next, if the action involved discretion on the part of the\n\nemployee, the court must consider whether the judgment was of the kind\n\nthe exception was designed to protect. Id.; accord Anderson, 692 N.W.2d\n\nat 364. We have adopted the Supreme Court view that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception “ ‘protects only governmental actions and decisions\n\nbased on considerations of public policy.’ ” Anderson, 692 N.W.2d at 364\n\n(quoting Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536–37, 108 S. Ct. at 1959, 100 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 541). The basis for the discretionary function exception is to “ ‘prevent\n\njudicial “second guessing” of . . . administrative decisions grounded in\n\nsocial, economic, and political policy’ through tort litigation, thereby\n\nprotecting [states] ‘from liability that would seriously handicap efficient\n\f                                      9\n\ngovernment operations.’ ” Ette, 656 N.W.2d at 67 (quoting Goodman, 587\n\nN.W.2d at 237).\n        [T]he primary factor in determining whether a particular\n        activity qualifies as a discretionary function is whether the\n        decision to act involves the evaluation of broad policy\n        factors. If so, the decision is more likely to be characterized\n        as a discretionary function.\n\nKeystone Elec. Mfg. v.

Conduct at issue. The first step in our analysis is to determine\n\nthe exact conduct that is at issue. Ette, 656 N.W.2d at 67. As previously\n\nnoted, the State must exercise reasonable care to protect prisoners from\n\nharm.     Barnard, 265 N.W.2d at 621.       Walker generally contends the\n\nState was liable under Iowa Code chapter 669 for the negligent\n\nsupervision of inmates, negligently failing to ensure his safety, and\n\nnegligently allowing a dangerous condition to exist in the gym.\n\n        2. Did the correctional staffs’ actions involve discretion?       With\n\nregards to Officer Walston, Walker alleged he failed to use reasonable\n\ncare because he failed to (1) alert staff and security of what was going to\n\nhappen in the gym, (2) write disciplinary notices on the involved inmates\n\nfor minor and/or major rule violations, (3) request an investigation and\n\f                                     10\n\nsegregation of the involved inmates, (4) prevent inmate Barnett from\n\nbeing out of placement, (5) prevent inmate Evans from leaving his unit in\n\nviolation of his cell restriction, and (6) engage in further discussions with\n\nthe inmates about the breakfast turn out argument. Walker asserts the\n\nState is not immune under the discretionary function exception because\n\nprison policies and procedures mandated Officer Walston take specific\n\nactions in light of the escalating verbal and physical confrontation\n\nbetween the inmates.       Walker further contends Activity Specialists\n\nBogdanski and Stipe were negligent because they failed to maintain\n\ndirect supervision over the inmates participating in recreational activities\n\nin the gym in violation of a mandatory policy. We begin our analysis by\n\nconsidering the policies Walker contends were violated by the activity\n\nspecialists.\n\n      Walker relies on CCF policy IO-SC-10 which provides that “[s]taff\n\nmust stay out of office areas to the greatest extent their duties allow and\n\nremain in personal contact with the offenders in their units,” and that\n\n“[o]ffenders involved in recreation activity . . . shall be subject to direct\n\nstaff supervision at all times when they are engaged in such activity.”\n\nWalker claims this policy required the activity specialists to provide\n\n“direct supervision [of inmates] at all times” and that their failure to do\n\nso subjected him to injury. Walker asserts the activity specialists were\n\naware of a blind spot in the gym where inmates could not easily be\n\nobserved and that neither activity specialist was specifically supervising\n\nthe inmates or observing the blind spot, which resulted in their failure to\n\ndiscover a fight between inmates that lasted up to fifteen minutes.\n\n      Upon our review, we disagree with Walker’s conclusion this policy\n\nimposed a nondiscretionary duty on the activity specialists in their\n\nsupervision of the inmates during their recreational period. Although the\n\f                                       11\n\npolicy directs staff to stay out of office areas and remain in personal\n\ncontact with offenders, the requirement is not absolute.            The policy is\n\nconditioned by the additional language “to the greatest extent their\n\nduties allow.” The policy clearly anticipates the need for prison staff to\n\nuse their discretion in the provision of supervision and acknowledges\n\nthat there are times when the job will require staff to be in an office area.\n\nCf.

Walker\n\nhas failed to identify any prison policy or procedure that required a\n\nspecific course of action for the activity specialists to follow in their\n\nsupervision of inmates during the exercise turn out.               Therefore, we\n\f                                    12\n\nconclude the supervision of inmates during the exercise turn out\n\ninvolved discretionary conduct on the part of the activity specialists.\n\n      Walker asserts CCF policies IN-VI-21, IS-CL-04, IO-SM-02, and\n\nPO-V-17 required Officer Walston to take specific actions and did not\n\nallow him to use his discretion under the circumstances. IDOC policy\n\nIS-CL-04 is entitled “Keep Separates.” It provides: “Staff who become[]\n\naware of an event or situation between two offenders that may potentially\n\npose a risk to the offenders while housed in an institution or residential\n\nfacility shall report that information to the . . . Shift Supervisor.” While\n\npolicy IS-CL-04 required the reporting of events or situations that may\n\nconstitute a danger to inmates, the policy does not expressly provide\n\nwhat constitutes a potential risk to the offender and, therefore, such a\n\ndetermination must rely on the judgment or discretion of the staff.\n\nMoreover, the policy does not require the report be prepared immediately.\n\nThe policy provides discretion to staff in the handling of the reporting\n\nfunction.\n\n      Policy IO-SM-02, A-2a is entitled “Administrative Segregation.” It\n\nprovides:   “An offender may be placed in (Administrative Segregation)\n\nAS3 at any time the Shift Supervisor determines there is credible\n\nevidence that the offender may be in physical danger.” Policy IO-SM-02\n\nis also discretionary.   It allows the shift supervisor to use his or her\n\ndiscretion to determine whether an offender needs to be placed in\n\nadministrative segregation for their protection. Cf. Cohen, 151 F.3d at\n\n1343 (holding the statutory provision did not mandate a specific,\n\nnondiscretionary course of conduct for the bureau of prisons to follow in\n\nclassifying prisoners). This policy did not mandate any specific action on\n\nthe part of Officer Walston.\n\f                                        13\n\n       Under policy PO-V-17, a unit officer was required to “[m]aintain\nsecurity of [the unit] and control of the offenders at all times.” Like the\npolicies already addressed, this policy imposes a general duty without\nprescribing any specific mandatory action by staff and allows for staff\ndiscretion in maintaining security and control of offenders.\n       Policy IN-VI-21 was the correctional facility disciplinary policy in\n\neffect at the time of the incident occurring prior to Walker’s assault.3\n\nPart IV of the policy provides for the disciplinary procedures to be used\n\nfor major offenses. The policy defines major offenses to include assault,\n\nfighting, threats and intimidation, out of placement of assignment, and\n\nobstructive or disruptive conduct. 4 Walker relies on the following portion\n\nof this policy to assert Officer Walston violated institutional policy in his\n\nhandling of the situation at the breakfast turn out.\n\n       A. Preparing The Disciplinary Report\n\n          1. Whenever an employee observes or discovers\n             misconduct or a threatening situation, the employee\n             will, if possible, direct the offender to take corrective\n             action.    If the corrective action is insufficient or\n             circumstances warrant, a disciplinary form may be\n             completed.     In either event, all incidents shall be\n             documented.\n\n              Any offender behavior which constitutes criminal\n              behavior or a serious threat to the safety and order of\n              the employees, offenders, or property of an institution\n              shall be reported by the employee observing the\n              incident or to whom the situation has been reported if\n              observed by a non-employee.\n\n          2. Violations shall be reported on the Disciplinary Report\n             Form IN-V-36 F-1 and forwarded to the shift\n             supervisor for further review.\n\n       3IN-VI-21was replaced by IO-RD-01 effective April 2008. We do not consider\nwhether our analysis would be the same under the current policy.\n       4The disciplinary policy defines each of these offenses. However, for summary\njudgment purposes, we assume, without deciding, that during the breakfast turn out\none or more of these offenses occurred.\n\f                                    14\n\n      ....\n\n      4. Disciplinary reports are to be promptly forwarded to the\n         shift supervisor or designate official . . . .\n\n      5. Shift supervisor . . . shall make an initial determination of\n         the status of the offender pending disciplinary\n         procedures. If necessary for the safety and security of\n         staff and other offenders, the offender may be assigned to\n         administrative segregation.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n      Walker acknowledges the policy provides that if an officer\n\nencounters misconduct or a threatening situation, the officer may\n\nattempt to resolve the issue by directing the inmate to take corrective\n\naction, and that, if the corrective action is insufficient or circumstances\n\nwarrant, the officer may complete a disciplinary report. Such language\n\nrequires no mandatory action on the part of the officer and clearly allows\n\nfor an officer to use his or her discretion. See Dykstra v. U.S. Bureau of\n\nPrisons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 795 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding prison policy did not\n\nrequire prison counselor to warn inmate that his youthful appearance\n\nmade him vulnerable to attack prior to obtaining waiver of protective\n\ncustody); Calderon, 123 F.3d at 949 (finding prison disciplinary\n\nregulation, which allowed staff to consider informal resolution of an\n\nincident gave prison personnel room for judgment in determining\n\nwhether to sanction an inmate).       Officer Walston did, in fact, take\n\ncorrective action by talking to the inmates and inquiring what the\n\nproblem was. At various points, he instructed inmates to return to their\n\ncells or units.\n\n      Walker asserts however, that the subsequent language in the\n\nregulation required Officer Walston to take further action under the\n\ncircumstances presented.      The regulation required Officer Walston to\n\nreport all incidents.   Moreover, it required criminal behavior or serious\n\f                                     15\n\nthreats to safety to be reported on a disciplinary form and promptly\n\nforwarded to the shift supervisor.        The shift supervisor would then\n\ndetermine whether it was necessary for the safety and security of staff\n\nand other offenders that the offender be assigned to administrative\n\nsegregation. Walker alleges Officer Walston was aware, after overhearing\n\nthe threats of assault and confronting Humphrey and Barnett, that the\n\ninmates were anticipating a fight.          Walker argues, under these\n\ncircumstances, the regulation required Officer Walston to make a prompt\n\nreport to his supervisor, who would then make the determination\n\nwhether there was credible evidence that an inmate may be in physical\n\ndanger and impose administrative segregation.\n      The State disputes Walker’s interpretation of the regulation.\nAlthough the regulation requires documentation of misconduct or a\nthreatening situation, the State asserts the policy does not mandate the\ntype, timing, or manner of documentation.        Those matters, the State\ncontends, are subject to staff discretion.     Moreover, assuming Officer\nWalston was required to document the verbal altercation, he did so later\nin the day.     Similarly, while the regulation also requires that criminal\nbehavior or a serious threat to the safety and order of an institution shall\nbe reported, the State contends there is no policy or rule for determining\nwhen conduct rises to the level of criminal behavior or a serious threat,\nand therefore, it was a judgment call best left to the discretion of the\nprison staff.    In support, the State relies on the affidavit of Associate\nWarden/Security at CCF, Jim Payne.          In addressing the policies and\nprocedures regarding inmate violations, Associate Warden Payne stated:\n            3. There is no written policy or procedure mandating\n      that when a correctional officer or other staff member\n      observes an inmate violating a minor or major rule that an\n      inmate disciplinary report be completed or that the inmate\n      be referred to the shift captain for segregation and lock up.\n\f                                    16\n            4. To the contrary the Correctional Officer or the staff\n      member is encouraged by written policy and procedure and\n      also through training, to attempt other less drastic corrective\n      action when possible.\n             5. The Correctional Officer or staff member must\n      make a decision based on judgment on what corrective\n      action is appropriate for the situation or event. Proper\n      corrective action can include anything from making your\n      presence known, to talking with the inmate, to a verbal\n      warning, to referring the matter to a shift manager to\n      consider segregation or lock up, or sending the inmates to\n      their cells.\n\nThe State also argues that there was no criminal behavior or serious\n\nthreat to the safety and order of the institution after Officer Walston\n\nspoke with the inmates. The State asserts the regulation requires the\n\nexercise of judgment and discretion similar to that found in Calderon.\n\n      In Calderon, a federal prison inmate informed prison personnel of\n\nthreats he had received from another inmate, Perez. 123 F.3d at 948.\n\nFederal prison disciplinary regulations provided that “ ‘[s]taff shall take\n\ndisciplinary action at such times and to the degree necessary to regulate\n\nan inmate’s behavior within the Bureau rules and institution guidelines\n\nand to promote a safe and orderly institution environment.’ ” Id. at 949\n\n(quoting 28 C.F.R. § 541.10(b)(2)).       The regulations further defined\n“ ‘[t]hreatening another with bodily harm or any other offense’ ” as a\n\nprohibited act for which disciplinary action must be taken. Id. (quoting\n\n28 C.F.R. § 541.13). The same regulations also required that\n      “when [the] staff witnesses or has reasonable belief that a\n      violation of [prison] regulations has been committed by an\n      inmate, and when staff considers informal resolution of the\n      incident inappropriate or unsuccessful, staff shall prepare\n      an Incident Report and promptly forward it to the\n      appropriate [supervisor].”\n\nId. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 541.14(a)).     Prison personnel took no steps to\n\nprotect Calderon or to discipline Perez, who eventually attacked and\n\f                                           17\n\nseriously injured Calderon.         Id. at 948.     The government claimed the\n\ndecision not to separate Calderon and Perez involved a discretionary act\n\nand therefore liability was barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(FTCA). Id.\n\n       In   reviewing    the    federal    regulations      for   addressing   inmate\n\nmisconduct, the court found that none of the cited regulations set forth\n\nany mandatory, nondiscretionary disciplinary action that required prison\n\npersonnel to take specific action against Perez prior to his attack on\n\nCalderon.     Id. at 949–50.       First, the regulations did not specify any\n\nparticular type of action personnel are required to take with respect to\n\ninmate discipline. Second, while section 541.14 may require an incident\n\nreport, which might ultimately lead to the imposition of a sanction, the\n\ncourt noted that such action was only required when (1) prison personnel\n\nwitness or have a reasonable belief that a violation has occurred, and\n\n(2) when staff considers informal resolution inappropriate.                  Calderon\n\npresented no evidence that prison personnel witnessed any violation of\n\nprison regulations or made any formal finding that Perez had actually\n\ncommitted any prohibited acts. Id. at 950. The court, therefore, found\n\nthe   regulations     clearly   gave      the   prison     personnel   discretion    in\n\ndetermining whether to sanction Perez. 5             Id.    The court also rejected\n\n         5The Seventh Circuit also rejected the defendant’s argument that the\n“reasonable belief” standard should be interpreted as “when a reasonable staff person\nwould have had a belief that a violation occurred.” Calderon, 123 F.3d at 950 n.1. It\nconcluded that if the discretionary function exception could be pierced by a showing of\nnegligence, then it was no shield at all. Id. In Parrott v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399743\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399743/parrott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n637 (7th Cir. 2008), the Seventh Circuit held that while 18 U.S.C. § 4042 provided a\nmandatory duty of care, it did not provide the manner by which that duty was to be\nfulfilled. However, it continued, an inmate was only required to show that the prison\nstaff knew or reasonably should have known of a potential problem between two\ninmates, seemingly a step away from Calderon. Parrott, 536 F.3d at 637. The appellate\ncourt concluded that the district court made no findings about what the prison official\nshould have known about the risks of placing Parrott in the same work detail as\nanother inmate and that this might be enough to warrant a remand on Parrott’s failure-\nto-protect claim. In the end, however, the decision to remand was due to disputed\n\f                                         18\n\nCalderon’s argument that 18 U.S.C. § 4042, which provides the Bureau\n\nof Prisons “shall . . . provide for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of\n\nall persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United\n\nStates,” required any mandatory action of the prison personnel. Id. at\n\n950.\n\n       The State’s reliance on Calderon is misplaced.            In Calderon, the\n\nstatute required action and a report when (1) a violation was witnessed\n\nor when a reasonable belief that a regulation violation had occurred and\n\n(2) prison personnel determined informal resolution was inappropriate or\n\nunsuccessful.     Id. at 949.    In Calderon, the court found there was no\n\nevidence that prison personnel witnessed any violation of prison\n\nregulations or made any formal finding that Perez had actually\n\ncommitted any of the prohibited acts.          Id. at 950. Here, however, the\n\nregulations required\n       [a]ny offender behavior which constitutes criminal behavior\n       or a serious threat to the safety and order of the employees,\n       offenders, or property of an institution shall be reported . . .\n       on the Disciplinary Report Form IN-V-36 F-1 and [promptly]\n       forwarded to the shift supervisor . . .

[and] if necessary for the safety\n       and security of staff and other offenders, the offender may be\n       assigned to administrative segregation.\n\n       We agree with the State that while the regulation provides\ndiscretion as to the reporting and handling of “misconduct or a\nthreatening situation,” with respect to “criminal behavior or a serious\nthreat,” the regulation requires the officer to promptly report to the shift\nsupervisor.      Pursuant to Policy IN-VI-21, assault is defined as\n“intentionally caus[ing] or threaten[ing] to cause injury to another\n__________________________\nissues of material fact as to whether the contents of a previously entered separation\norder left prison personnel without discretion to keep Parrott and the other inmate\nseparate.

Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1816 (unabr. ed. 2002) [hereinafter\nWebster’s].     However, because at this stage the material facts are\ndisputed, we are unable to determine whether, for example, an assault,\nwhich by definition constitutes criminal behavior, occurred and would,\nunder the circumstances, constitute a serious threat. Because material\nfacts are at issue, i.e., whether Officer Walston overheard threats of\nassault and preparation for a fight during the exercise turn out, it is not\npossible to determine whether the regulation required Officer Walston to\nprepare a report, which must then be promptly forwarded to the shift\nsupervisor for review and consideration of any potential additional safety\nmeasures.

Was the discretion susceptible to policy-related judgments?\nNevertheless, even if we conclude none of the policy provisions discussed\nrequired mandatory action by prison personnel, we conclude the\ndiscretionary function exception is not applicable in this case because\nthe decisions by prison staff in the supervision of the inmates did not\ninvolve the evaluation of broad public policy factors.

City of Ankeny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1608478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1608478/graber-v-city-of-ankeny/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (Iowa 2003).\n      The State argues the evidence supports the conclusion correctional\nstaff, in supervising the inmates and addressing inmate behavior, could\nhave considered social and economic policies.       Specifically, the State\nnotes the legislature has granted the IDOC statutory authority to create\ndisciplinary procedures and adopt rules pertaining to the internal\nmanagement of penal institutions within the state.         See Iowa Code\n§§ 904.108(1)(a), (k); .205. Under these rules, staff is given discretion in\nthe application of corrective action and the reporting of rule violations.\nIn his affidavit, Associate Warden Payne maintained such discretion is\nnecessary because rule violation is very common in prison. If every rule\nviolation resulted in a disciplinary report or segregation, he asserted, the\ncorrectional staff would be unable to perform their job, which would\nresult in the deterioration of the safe and efficient operation of the\n\f                                     21\n\nfacility.   It would require more staff to be hired, an economic\nconsideration. Moreover, the increased disciplinary action and lock ups\nwould produce inmate dissatisfaction and frustration, resulting in\nthreats to the safe and efficient operation of the facility. The State argues\nthis case is similar to and governed by our analysis in Anderson.\n       In Anderson, the plaintiff brought a premise liability claim,\nasserting the State was negligent for failing to close the university library\ndue to inclement weather. 692 N.W.2d at 361. The evidence established\nthe university had a written policy concerning operations during adverse\nweather.    Id. at 362.   In deciding whether the discretionary function\nexception applied to the dean’s decision not to close the library early, we\nconsidered our application of the discretionary function exception in\nother cases.   In cases where we held the exception inapplicable, the\nrecord showed the governmental entity did not base its action on\nrequired policy considerations, but rather the action arose out of the day-\nto-day activities of the business of government.

We     held   that    “[u]nless    a\ngovernmental entity can demonstrate that when it exercised its\njudgment, it genuinely could have considered and balanced factors\nsupported by social, economic, or political policies, we will not recognize\nthe discretionary function immunity.”             Id. at 366 (citing Graber, 656\nN.W.2d at 165).\n        Applying this test to the facts, in Anderson we found the dean\nconsidered and balanced the same factors used by the university when it\nformulated the policy: providing the maximum opportunity for students\nand staff to utilize the library, thus furthering the public policy of\nproviding the best college education at a reasonable cost, against the\nadequacy of the staff and the number of persons using the library\nfacilities.     Id.        Because   the   dean   could    balance      these   policy\nconsiderations        in   making    her   determination,    we    concluded         the\ndiscretionary function exception applied.\n        Here, we conclude the discretionary function exception is not\napplicable because the decisions made by the correctional staff in the\nsupervision of the inmates did not involve the evaluation of broad public\npolicy factors.       The correctional staffs’ handling of the confrontation\nduring the breakfast turn out and their supervision of the inmates\nduring the exercise turn out was not the product of a judgment call\ndriven by legitimate social, economic, or political concerns. As we held in\nMadden,\n               While most governmental actions involve some degree\n        of discretion, only those choices based upon the “meaningful\n        exercise of discretion” are immune from liability. The critical\n        distinction “is the one between a judgment that embodies a\n        professional assessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of\n        settled priorities and a fully discretionary judgment that\n        balances incommensurable values in order to establish those\n        priorities.” An immune government function is “one that\n        weighs competing ideals in order to promote those concerns\n\f                                    23\n      of paramount importance over the less essential, opposing\n      values.”\n\n661 N.W.2d at 139 (quoting Graber, 656 N.W.2d at 164–65). There is no\nevidence that, in their supervision of the inmates, the correctional staff\ncould have or did weigh competing ideals or balance incommensurable\nvalues to promote those concerns of paramount importance. Rather, as\nin Madden, the actions of the correctional staff “embod[ied] a professional\nassessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of settled priorities.” Id.\n      The decisions made by Officer Walston in handling the situation\nthat unfolded during the breakfast turn out and the activity specialists’\nsupervision of the inmates in the gym during the exercise turn out were\nad hoc decisions.   See Webster’s at 26 (defining “ad hoc” as “made,\nestablished, acting, or concerned with a particular end or purpose” and\n“without reference to wider application”). There is nothing in the record\nto suggest that in performing their duties, the correctional staff could\nhave weighed competing ideals in order to determine how to supervise\nthe inmates.\n      We acknowledge the State’s reliance on several federal cases in\n\nwhich the federal courts found the discretionary function exception\n\napplicable against claims prison officials were negligent in failing to\n\nprotect inmates.

Most of these cases rely upon\n\nthe United States Supreme Court’s holding in Gaubert.         See Santana-\n\nRosa, 335 F.3d at 43–44; Cohen, 151 F.3d at 1344; Calderon, 123 F.3d\n\nat 950; Dykstra, 140 F.3d at 795.

Therefore, we find it helpful to consider\n\nGaubert and its analysis.\n\n      In Gaubert, a shareholder of an insolvent savings and loan\n\nassociation brought an action against the United States under the FTCA.\n\n499 U.S. at 320, 111 S. Ct. at 1272, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 345. After the\n\nsavings and loan went into receivership, the shareholder alleged\n\nnegligence of federal officers and directors in selecting the new officers\n\nand directors and in participating in the day-to-day management of the\n\nsavings and loan.     Id.   The district court granted the government’s\n\nmotion to dismiss, holding all of the challenged actions fell within the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to the FTCA. Id. The Supreme Court\n\ngranted certiorari.\n\n      In applying the second prong of the Berkovitz test, the Court noted:\n            Where Congress has delegated the authority to an\n      independent agency or to the Executive Branch to implement\n      the general provisions of a regulatory statute and to issue\n      regulations to that end, there is no doubt that planning-level\n      decision establishing programs are protected by the\n      discretionary function exception, as is the promulgation of\n      regulations by which the agencies are to carry out the\n      programs. . . . [T]he actions of Government agents involving\n      the necessary element of choice and grounded in the social,\n      economic, or political goals of the statute and regulations are\n      protected.\n\nId. at 323, 111 S. Ct. at 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 347. Summarizing the\n\napplication of the test, the Court held:\n      [I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the\n      employee obeys the direction, the Government will be\n      protected because the action will be deemed in furtherance\n      of the policies which led to the promulgation of the\n      regulation.      If the employee violates the mandatory\n      regulation, there will be no shelter from liability because\n      there is no room for choice and the action will be contrary to\n      policy. On the other hand, if a regulation allows the employee\n      discretion, the very existence of the regulation creates a strong\n      presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the\n\f                                    26\n      regulation involves consideration of the same policies which\n      led to the promulgation of the regulations.\n\nId. at 324, 111 S. Ct. at 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 347 (emphasis added)\n\n(citation omitted). Thus, Gaubert held that\n      [w]hen established governmental policy . . . allows a\n      Government agent to exercise discretion, it must be\n      presumed that the agent’s acts are grounded in policy when\n      exercising that discretion. For a complaint to survive a\n      motion to dismiss, it must allege facts which would support\n      a finding that the challenged actions are not the kind of\n      conduct that can be said to be grounded in the policy of the\n      regulatory scheme.\n\nId. at 324–25, 111 S. Ct. at 1274–75, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 348. The Court\n\nheld that the focus was not on the subjective intent of the agent\n\nexercising the discretion conferred by the regulation, but rather on the\n\nnature of the actions taken and their susceptibility to policy analysis.\n\nThus, there is a presumption that discretionary acts performed pursuant\n\nto relevant policies, including those performed in the day-to-day\n\noperations, are entitled to the exemption. Id. at 332–33, 111 S. Ct. at\n\n1278–79, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 352–53.\n\n      Although concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia wrote\n\nseparately to voice his disagreement with the analysis employed by the\n\nmajority. Id. at 334, 111 S. Ct. at 1280, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 354 (Scalia, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).        In his concurrence,\n\nJustice Scalia examines the oft times confusing application of the second\n\nportion of the two-prong Berkovitz test.      Noting that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception to the FTCA does not protect all governmental\n\nactivities involving choice, Justice Scalia observed that the choice “must\n\nrepresent a ‘policy judgment.’ ”    Id. at 335, 111 S. Ct. at 1280, 113\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 354.   While acknowledging that the planning/operational\n\ndichotomy is wrong, Justice Scalia nevertheless argued “that the level at\n\f                                      27\n\nwhich the decision is made is often relevant to the discretionary function\n\ninquiry, since the answer to that inquiry turns on both the subject\n\nmatter and the office of the decisionmaker.”             Id. at 335, 111 S. Ct. at\n\n1280, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 355.        In his view, a discretionary choice was\n\nshielded from liability only “if the choice is, under the particular\n\ncircumstances, one that ought to be informed by considerations of social,\n\neconomic, or political policy and is made by an officer whose official\n\nresponsibilities   include   assessment       of    those   considerations.”    Id.\n\n(emphasis added) (noting, as an example, the dock foreman’s decision to\n\ncompactly store bags of fertilizer would not be protected, even if he\n\ncalculated cost versus safety, because it was not his responsibility to\n\nponder such things).\n\n       We note Gaubert involved a motion to dismiss and the presumption\n\nthat when there is an established governmental policy that allows for\n\ndiscretion, “it must be presumed that the agent’s acts are grounded in\n\npolicy when exercising that discretion.” Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 324, 111\n\nS. Ct. at 1274, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 348. Although we have previously cited\n\nGaubert, see Goodman, 587 N.W.2d at 238; Schneider, 789 N.W.2d at\n\n147, it does not appear that we have adopted this presumption, but\n\nrather our analysis in our prior discretionary function cases are more in\n\nline   with   Justice   Scalia’s   analysis        in   determining   whether   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception is applicable.               See Anderson, 692\n\nN.W.2d at 366 (finding dean’s decision not to close library during\n\ninclement weather could be and was based upon a balancing of public\n\npolicy factors); Madden, 661 N.W.2d at 140 (during performance of a\n\nroutine duty “public official did not weigh any broad-sweeping policies\n\nbefore he decided not to perform a required inspection”); Ette, 656\n\nN.W.2d at 69 (holding supervision of students “is not . . . driven by\n\f                                    28\n\npublic policy implications uniquely within the purview of school officials\n\nand employees”); Messerschmidt, 654 N.W.2d at 883 (“Matters such as\n\nwhen to lift a temporary road barricade do not require evaluation of\n\npolicies but instead involved implementation of everyday decisions\n\nroutinely made by the city.”); Doe, 652 N.W.2d at 445 (noting that it is\n\npossible to articulate some notion of policy considerations involved in\n\nany decision but that the administrative act of hiring, retaining, and\n\nsupervising an individual teacher does not involve the careful balancing\n\nof competing interests, risks, and advantages, and does not elevate such\n\ndecision to the level of economic, political, or social policymaking);\n\nBellman, 617 N.W.2d at 19 (holding while a teacher’s supervisory duties\n\ninvolve matters of judgment, policy considerations are not involved in the\n\ndecisions made by a teacher in supervising her class); see also Butler ex\n\nrel.

The legislature intended the ITCA to have the\n\nsame effect as the FTCA. Feltes, 385 N.W.2d at 547. Thus, we give great\n\nweight to relevant federal decisions interpreting the Federal Act.

In Panella, the court narrowly construed the FTCA and\n\nlimited its application to claims arising from intentional torts by\n\ngovernment employees. Id. at 624–25. The Panella decision is founded\n\non the principle that the essence of the claim against the government is\n\nthe negligence of their employees, not the assault. Id. at 624. To hold\n\notherwise would exonerate the government from all liability where the\n\ninjuries to the claimant were caused by an assault. Id.\n\n         Adopting the analysis in Panella and citing the holding in Muniz,\n\nthe Supreme Court limited the intentional tort exception to cases arising\n\nout of assaults by federal employees. Sheridan, 487 U.S. at 398–400,\n\n108 S. Ct. at 2454–55, 101 L. Ed. 2d at 360–62. Although we have not\n\ndecided this issue under the ITCA, we find Panella, Muniz, and Sheridan\n\nare persuasive.\n\n         The basis of Walker’s claim is not that an employee of the State\n\ninflicted an intentional tort, but rather the State was negligent in failing\n\nto protect him from an assault by another prisoner. The whole purpose\n\nof the ITCA is to waive sovereign immunity for the negligent acts of the\n\nState.     To limit the State’s liability whenever an assault causes the\n\nclaimant’s damages would relieve the State of its liability for its negligent\n\nacts. This construction of the intentional tort exception is contrary to\n\nthe intent of the legislature when it enacted the ITCA.       In construing\n\nstatutes, we are required to determine legislative intent.

State\n\nMANSFIELD, Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I concur in part and dissent in part.     I would find that Officer\n\nWalston’s response to the “verbal altercation” involved an exercise of\n\ndiscretion for which the State is immune from suit under Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14(1) (2005).\n\n      First, I believe the facts are clear that prison regulations gave\n\nOfficer Walston discretion in responding to the prisoner argument that\n\noccurred during the breakfast turnout. As noted by the majority, Kevin\n\nWalker criticizes Officer Walston’s job performance in six different ways.\n\nHowever, the majority can point to only one area in which Walker\n\nconceivably did not have discretion, that is, the requirement that “a\n\nserious threat to the safety and order of the employees, offenders, or\n\nproperty of an institution shall be reported by the employee observing the\n\nincident.” But even here, the majority notes that Walker did file a report,\n\nand the regulations do not state how promptly a report has to be filed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in this instance, the report concerning the incident did\n\nnot get filed before Walker was struck in the gym around 8:15 a.m. the\n\nsame morning. In short, this part of the litigation involved an effort to\n\nsecond-guess a correctional officer’s exercise of judgment.\n\n      Having found that Officer Walston was exercising discretion in how\n\nhe managed this inmate-to-inmate confrontation, I would find the State\n\nimmune from suit relating to his acts or omissions. I see no reason why\n\nIowa’s discretionary function exception cannot apply to “decisions made\n\nby the correctional staff in the supervision of inmates.”      Iowa Code\n\nsection 669.14(1) is generally worded.     It provides the State shall be\n\nimmune from tort liability “based upon the exercise or performance or\n\nthe failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the\n\f                                    33\n\npart of a state agency or an employee of the state, whether or not the\n\ndiscretion be abused.” Iowa Code § 669.14(1). Thus, under the statute,\n\nthe individual exercising discretion can be any state “employee,”\n\nincluding someone performing the difficult and demanding job of a\n\ncorrectional officer.\n\n      Iowa Code section 669.14(1) is directly modeled after the\n\ndiscretionary function exception in the Federal Tort Claims Act. See 28\n\nU.S.C.A. § 2680(a) (West, Westlaw through P.L. 112–24 approved July\n\n26, 2011). As noted by the majority, there are many federal precedents\n\napplying the federal discretionary function exception to claims brought\n\nby prison inmates against prison staff.\n\n             The great weight of the case law suggests that if a\n      decision regarding the protection, safety, and classification of\n      prisoners is discretionary (i.e., there are no mandatory\n      directives), then such a decision is grounded in public policy\n      and the discretionary function exception applies.\n\nSledge v.

D.C. 2010) (citing\n\nnumerous cases).\n\n      This outcome follows from the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in United States v. Gaubert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991). There, the Supreme Court held that, if a regulatory\n\nscheme affords discretion and the challenged actions can be said to be\n\ngrounded in the policy of the regulatory scheme, the discretionary\n\nfunction exception applies. Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 324–25, 111 S. Ct. at\n\n1274–75, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 347–48. The nature of the conduct, rather\n\nthan the status of the actor, governs whether the exception applies. Id.\n\nat 322, 111 S. Ct. at 1273, 113 L. Ed. 2d at 346. Thus, for example, if a\n\nregulation allows for discretion in responding to a specific prison\n\nsituation and the prison official’s response can be said to be related to\n\f                                    34\n\nlegitimate prison policy considerations, the discretionary exception\n\nfunction applies and the government is immune from suit. If this case\n\nwere in federal court concerning an incident that occurred in federal\n\nprison, I have little doubt that Walker would be unable to sue over\n\nOfficer Walston’s alleged acts and omissions.\n\n      Today’s   decision,   however,     limits   the   availability   of   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to situations in which the decision\n\ninvolved the actual “evaluation of broad public policy factors” or the\n\n“weigh[ing of] competing ideals.”   This approach effectively transforms\n\nthe discretionary function exception into an elites-only exemption.\n\nCorrectional officers are not such an elite. They perform a dangerous,\n\nstressful, but nonetheless discretion-filled job that does not allow them\n\nthe luxury of pondering broad public policy implications or weighing\n\ncompeting ideals.\n\n      I think Gaubert is a sensible construction of the statutory language\n\nand ought to be the rule in Iowa.

That approach also\n\narguably revives the concept that decisions made at the operational level\n\f                                     36\n\ncannot be subject to the discretionary function exception—a principle we\n\nsaid we were discarding in Goodman. 587 N.W.2d at 238.\n\n      Yet, in none of our prior cases have we said we were departing\n\nfrom Gaubert or overruling Goodman. I would not take that step today.\n\nRather, I would continue to follow Gaubert and Goodman and apply them\n\nto the prison conditions at issue in this case.\n\n      Accordingly, I would find that Officer Walston was exercising\n\nprison-related discretion when he allegedly did not take sufficient steps\n\nto protect Walker from a threat. Officer Walston’s testimony describes\n\nthe prison policy considerations that entered into his decisions:\n\n      [M]ost people, when they get loud in the middle of the day\n      room so it draws your attention to the problem, most\n      people—not all, as you say—are looking for an out. They’re\n      looking for the CO to become involved so they don’t have to\n      come to blows. That—that’s the way it works around here a\n      lot of times.\n\n            ....\n\n            They want you to get involved to say, hey, you need to\n      knock that off. There ain’t going to be any fighting here. I\n      got my eyes on you. I’m watching you. Don’t—don’t keep\n      going on. And that gives everybody an easy out. So they\n      don’t have to lose face to their peers inside here. . . .\n\n            ....\n\n            . . . [T]hat’s the first continuum of how you deal with\n      it. You approach them. It’s your presence. You talk to\n      them. You tell them. You see how it’s going to work out.\n      That’s how it progresses.\n\n            It doesn’t always start from one and go to like one,\n      two, three, four on a policy order in the way it’s presented.\n      Sometimes you have to skip over if it’s—if it’s turned about,\n      you have to go to a higher degree right off the bat, but on a\n      normal progression, it’s just like minor reports. You’d go\n      with them. You tell them not to do it. You give them a\n      verbal warning. You give them the written. Make them do a\n      responsibility report.\n\f                                     37\n            It all goes up the line unless they just don’t listen and\n      you have to go to a higher degree. You don’t want to start at\n      the top. You have to have somewhere to go.\n\n      Of course, even under my colleagues’ approach, the fact finder may\n\nwell decide that Officer Walston acted reasonably and thus reject\n\nWalker’s claim.    However, in adopting section 669.14(1), I believe the\n\nlegislature intended to provide an immunity for these kinds of judgment\n\ncalls by a correctional officer.\n\n      I agree with my colleagues’ conclusion that the discretionary\n\nfunction exception does not apply to Walker’s allegation that Activity\n\nSpecialists Bogdanski and Stipe failed to properly supervise the exercise\n\nturnout at which Walker was actually struck and injured.                 This\n\nallegation appears to involve garden-variety negligence rather than an\n\nexercise of prison-related discretion. I also agree that the intentional tort\n\nexception does not apply here and thus join part III. C. of the majority\n\nopinion.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n      Waterman, J., joins this concurrence in part and dissent in part.\n\f</pre>",
