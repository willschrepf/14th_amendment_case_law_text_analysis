(\"Cabletron\").\n\nCraig  Benson   and  Robert  Levine,   supervisory  employees  of\n\nCabletron, were also defendants in the district court.\n\n          Plaintiff Scarfo claimed,  inter alia, that  defendants\r                                                         \n\ndiscriminated  against her on the basis of her sex and terminated\n\nher employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act,\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(f).\n\n          Plaintiff  Miller claimed, inter  alia, under Title VII\r                                                          \n\nfor  retaliatory  discharge  based  on his  alleged  refusal,  as\n\nplaintiff  Scarfo's immediate supervisor, to discriminate against\n\nher by terminating her employment on the basis of her sex.\n\n          The  principal  claims  of  error  asserted  on  appeal\n\nchallenge  instructions to the jury.  Each party opposing a claim\n\nof error asserts that no timely objection or request  was made in\n\nthe trial court.\n\n          Counsel  representing defendants  on appeal  first came\n\ninto   the  case  after  completion  of  the  jury  trial.    Not\n\nsurprisingly,  they  seek  to present  contentions  substantially\n\ndifferent  from those  presented  by defense  counsel during  and\n\nbefore the jury trial.  Whenever new counsel enter and raise  new\n\ncontentions,   opposing  counsel   may   find  irresistible   the\n\ntemptation  to counter with new contentions of their own.  Almost\n\ninevitably,  then, the entry into  a case of  new counsel for one\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nparty  increases litigation burdens for all parties.  An award of\n\nattorneys' fees to a  prevailing party may offset this  burden in\n\npart.  But unfairness may remain to opposing parties if the trial\n\nor appellate court allows  new grounds of claim or  defense to be\n\nasserted.    For  this  reason,  among  others,  we  encounter  a\n\nthreshold question in this case.\n\n          One way  of framing  the threshold question  neutrally,\n\nabjuring  \"plain error,\"  United States  v.

Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 291 U.S.\r                                                                 \n\n491,  499  (1934)  (Cardozo,  J.,   dissenting)  (\"The  attempted\n\ndistinction between accidental results and accidental  means will\n\nplunge this branch of the law into a Serbonian Bog.\").\n\n          The imagery, even  if hyperbole in the classic sense of\n\na  figure  of  speech  rather  than  an  assertion  to  be  taken\n\nliterally,  may   nevertheless  aptly   call  attention   to  the\n\nincreasing  intricacy  of  a rapidly  evolving  jurisprudence  of\n\nprocedural preclusion.\n\n          We conclude that we  need enter only a little  way into\n\nthis maze of precedents, and on a well-marked path, to decide the\n\ncase now before us.  This is so because rules and precedents have\n\nerected  a gate  at  the point  of  entry upon  each  potentially\n\npromising  path  through the  maze, and  each  gate is  closed to\n\nappellants whose contentions have the  particular characteristics\n\nof those before us in this appeal.  Thus, we affirm in substance,\n\nthough  with  minor exceptions,  and  with  some modification  of\n\namounts of awards, and on condition that a judgment amended as to\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nform be entered in the district court.\n\n          We first  explain the  terms of  the judgment  that was\n\nordered  in the district  court and the  nature of  the claims of\n\nerror.  Then we explain why, in the interests of justice, we hold\n\nthat  each claim  of  error asserted  in  this appeal  is  either\n\nharmless  error  or  is raised  too  late  for  review under  the\n\nharmless error standard  and cannot be  sustained under the  more\n\nrigorous requirement that relief is to be granted only to avoid a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\n\n          The first error  we address  is one not  raised by  the\n\nparties.   We consider  it because  it might  be thought to  have\n\njurisdictional  implications.   The \"final  judgment\"  entered in\n\nthis  case was, in its form, not literally in compliance with the\n\nrequirement  that  \"[e]very  judgment shall  be  set  forth on  a\n\nseparate document.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.\n\n          The district court made not one but a series of orders.\n\nIn most  instances, the order is not  self-explanatory.  Instead,\n\nit refers to an opinion  or memorandum of the court to  which one\n\nmust go  to understand  precisely the meaning  of the order.   In\n\nthese circumstances,  if, for example, a  party seeks enforcement\n\nof the  judgment -- perhaps even after the case is closed and the\n\nfile  is sent  to storage  -- the  parties and  any  other person\n\nrequired  to  act will  have  great difficulty  finding  out what\n\nexactly were the terms of the \"final judgment.\"\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          In support  of our  jurisdiction, however,  we conclude\n\nthat the  district court ordered  the functional equivalent  of a\n\n\"final judgment\" in a sequence of orders that includes:\n\n               the   \"Judgment\"   of   May   10,   1994\n\n          (incorporating,  first, the Order  of June 2,\n\n          1993 granting  in part  and  denying in  part\n\n          defendants'  Motion  to Dismiss;

Implicit in  those orders\n\nand  the basis  on  which they  are  explained in  the  memoranda\n\nreferred  to,  however, is  an  assumption  that  the  awards  to\n\nplaintiff Miller  overlap.  Because duplicative  collection would\n\nbe impermissible,  we conclude it is appropriate to interpret the\n\ntrial court's orders as  providing that Miller not be  allowed to\n\ncollect more than the  larger (i.e., the Title VII  award) of the\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ntwo awards against Cabletron.  See Part XIV, infra.\r                                                            \n\n          On July 19, 1994, the district court awarded attorneys'\n\nfees and disbursements to plaintiffs.  Thus, two more paragraphs,\n\nas  stated below, may be added to reflect the entire substance of\n\na  final judgment that includes awards of attorneys' fees.  These\n\nprovisions,  we  note, might  have been  made  in a  later order,\n\nrather than in the \"final judgment\" itself.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r                                                          \n\n54(d)(2).  These paragraphs are as follows:\n\n               (m)    judgment  for   plaintiff  Scarfo\n\n          against defendants Cabletron and  Benson, for\n\n          attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements, in  the\n\n          amount   of    $244,255.13   (consisting   of\n\n          $225,300.13  incurred for services of one and\n\n          $19,955 incurred for services of the other of\n\n          two firms that represented her);\n\n               (n)    judgment  for   plaintiff  Miller\n\n          against defendants Cabletron and  Benson, for\n\n          attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements, in  the\n\n          amount of $117,510.97.\n\n          The Order of July 20, 1994,  which was the last of  the\n\nseries  of Orders  constituting  the functional  equivalent of  a\n\nFinal Judgment, also requires the addition of one more paragraph:\n\n               (o)  Post-judgment  interest is  allowed\n\n          on  the awards in  paragraphs (a),  (d), (h),\n\n          (i), (m), and (n).\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          Defendants-Appellants Cabletron and Benson  appeal from\n\nthe judgment entered  against them on multiple  grounds.

Defendants'   Appeal   from   Judgment   on   Scarfo's   Sex\r          A.   Defendants'   Appeal   from   Judgment   on   Scarfo's   Sex\n     Discrimination Claim\r               Discrimination Claim\n\n          Defendants  ask us  to vacate  the judgment  for Scarfo\n\nagainst  them  on  her  Title  VII  claim  because  of  erroneous\n\ninstructions to the jury.\n\n          On  the  element of  causation  in  Scarfo's Title  VII\n\nclaim, the trial judge instructed the jury:\n\n          Ms.  Scarfo may  prove her  claims; that  is,\n          make  out a prima  facie case, in  one of two\n          ways.  First she may  simply produce evidence\r                                                                 \n          that her  gender was a factor which motivated\n          the  defendants  in  making   the  challenged\n          employment  decisions.   [Ms.  Scarfo h]aving\r                                                                 \n          done so,  the defendants are  liable even  if\r                                                                 \n          they  would  have  made  the  same  decisions\r                                                                 \n          absent  the  discriminatory motive.   Second,\r                                                       \n          she  may  also establish  a prima  facie case\n          without  direct  evidence  of  discriminatory\n          intent by producing  indirect evidence  which\n          is  sufficient to  raise  a presumption  that\n          absent any other  explanation the  defendants\n          acted for discriminatory  reasons.  She  need\n          not  prove  that  Cabletron  acted  with  any\n          discriminatory intent.\n\n          We   conclude,  as   defendants   contend,  that   this\n\ninstruction  was  flawed  in  its  treatment  of  the  issue   of\n\ncausation.   The instruction  understated  plaintiff's burden  of\n\nproof  as initially defined in McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v. Green,\r                                                                          \n\n411 U.S. 792 (1973), and further developed in later cases.\n\n          Before  the trial  court charged  the jury,  defendants\n\nfiled  an  appropriate request  for  jury  instruction, correctly\n\nstating  a rule of law  declared in Price  Waterhouse v. Hopkins,\r                                                                          \n\n490 U.S.  228 (1989).   But defendants did  not object after  the\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncharge  was given  to the  jury, as  required by  Rule 51  of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n          To  what extent can the defendants now be heard on this\n\nclaim of error?  We return to this question in Part IV below.\n\nB.   Defendants' Appeal  from Judgment on Scarfo's  Equal Pay Act\r          B.   Defendants' Appeal  from Judgment on Scarfo's  Equal Pay Act\n     Claim\r               Claim\n\n          Defendants  ask us  to vacate  the judgment  for Scarfo\n\nagainst them on her claim under the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\") because\n\nof erroneous instructions to the jury.\n\n          Specifically, they  contend that the trial judge failed\n\nto  give any instruction on causation or on statutory defenses to\n\nliability.\n\n          The  trial  judge's  instructions  on   the  EPA  claim\n\nincluded the following:\n\n          Ms.    Scarfo    alleges    that    Cabletron\n          discriminated against her based on her sex in\n          violation of the  federal Equal Pay  Act law.\n          Ms.  Scarfo  need  not  prove  that Cabletron\n          intended  to  discriminate against  her.   In\n          comparing her  work  to that  of higher  paid\n          men, Ms.  Scarfo need not show  that her work\n          was  precisely equal,  but  only that  it was\n          substantially equal.... Ms. Scarfo  need only\n          show  unequal pay  as compared with  one male\n          employee....  If you  find  that    Cabletron\n          violated the Equal Pay  Act, she is  entitled\n          to recovery for unpaid wages. \n\n          The  special   verdict  form  submitted   to  the  jury\n\ncontained the following question:\n\n          [D]o you  find that during the  course of Ms.\n          Scarfo's employment Cabletron  paid her at  a\n          lower  rate than  it paid  men who  performed\n          jobs  requiring  substantially  equal  skill,\n          effort   and  responsibility   and  involving\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          similar working conditions?\n\n          The jury was instructed to make a finding of damages if\n\nthey answered this question in the affirmative.\n\n          Defendants   made   no  objection,   within   the  time\n\nprescribed in Rule 51, either to the question on the verdict form\n\nor to the  instructions.  Thus, they failed to  call to the trial\n\njudge's  attention  the  alleged   lack  of  any  instruction  on\n\ncausation or on statutory defenses to Scarfo's EPA claim.\n\n          We return to this alleged error in Part V, below.\n\nC.   Plaintiff Scarfo's Appeal of Her Hostile Environment Claim\r          C.   Plaintiff Scarfo's Appeal of Her Hostile Environment Claim\n\n          Plaintiff-Cross Appellant Scarfo argues on cross-appeal\n\nthat  the court's instruction on  her sexual harassment claim was\n\nerroneous.\n\n          The trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n          In order to establish  a prima facie case for\n          sexual  harassment  under  Title VII  of  the\n          Civil Rights  Act,  [Scarfo] must  prove  the\n          following  elements by a preponderance of the\r                                       \n          evidence. One,  she was subject  to unwelcome\n          sexual  conduct.     Two,  unwelcome   sexual\n          conduct was based upon [her] sex.  Three, the\n          unwelcome  sexual conduct  was  so severe  or\n          pervasive  that it had the effect of creating\n          an    abusive   working    environment   that\r                                                                 \n          unreasonably   interfered   with   her   work\r                                                                 \n          performance.\r                                \n\n          After the  jury charge was  given, plaintiff's  counsel\n\nmade an objection to the court as follows:\n\n               In this instruction that was given, this\n          wording on the elements that she has to prove\n          the sexual  harassment claim has  the wording\n          in  it  \"that  unreasonably  interfered  with\n          Plaintiff Scarfo's work  performance,\" and  I\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          think the way it was read, that comes out  as\n          sounding  like an  element  that she  has  to\n          prove,  and the  Harris  case,  which we  had\r                                           \n          requested instruction on, . . . [states that]\n          that's one factor that can be considered, but\n          it's not an element of her claim.\n               And we had  requested . . . a  paragraph\n          that was  not given  but that comes  from the\n          recent Harris  case that says  that you don't\r                                 \n          have  to  have the  unreasonable interference\n          with  work performance.  It can be harassment\n          that affects the psychological well-being and\n          detract[s] from  one's work and we would like\n          to   have  that   instruction  given   and  a\n          clarification that this isn't an  element she\n          has to prove.\n\n          We return to this matter in Part VI, below.\n\nD.   Plaintiff Miller's Appeal of His Wrongful Discharge Claim\r          D.   Plaintiff Miller's Appeal of His Wrongful Discharge Claim\n\n          Plaintiff-Cross Appellant Miller argues on cross-appeal\n\nthat the court's instruction on damages with  respect to Miller's\n\nwrongful discharge claim was erroneous.\n\n          There are three types of damages at issue in this case:\n\n\"pecuniary  damages,\" such  as damages  for economic  harm; \"non-\n\npecuniary damages,\" such  as damages for pain  and suffering; and\n\n\"enhanced compensatory damages,\" claimed under New Hampshire law.\n\nThe parties do not  contest, and for present purposes  we assume,\n\nthat  \"enhanced  compensatory  damages\"  may be  awarded  in  the\n\ndiscretion   of  the   jury  if   the  defendant's   conduct  was\n\nparticularly egregious.\n\n          See, e.g., DCPB, Inc. v. City of Lebanon, 957 F.2d\r                                                            \n     913 (1st Cir. 1992)(New Hampshire law).\n\n          Miller  argues  that the  court  erred  in refusing  to\n\ninstruct the  jury on nonpecuniary damages.   Defendant Cabletron\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nasserts  that,  in  fact, the  court  did  instruct  the jury  on\n\nnonpecuniary damages.\n\n          We return to this matter in Part VII, below.\n\n        III.

P. 51.\n\n          If a party  complies with Rule  51, then the  \"harmless\n\nerror\" standard of Rule 61 governs the trial or appellate court's\n\nconsideration  of any  request  for relief  based on  the alleged\n\nerror.   The court  is  directed not  to treat  as  a ground  for\n\ngranting a new trial,  or setting aside a verdict, or vacating or\n\nmodifying  a judgment or order,  any error or  defect or anything\n\ndone or omitted by the court\n\n          unless refusal to take such action appears to\n          the   court  inconsistent   with  substantial\n          justice.   The  court at  every stage  of the\n          proceeding must disregard any error or defect\n          in the proceeding  which does not  affect the\n          substantial rights of the parties.\n\nFed.

The moment immediately  before the jury\n\nretires  to  deliberate   is  a  time  when  hard  choices,  with\n\nsignificant  consequences, must be made by the parties and by the\n\ntrial judge.

It is awkward to change\n\ninstructions after the jury has  commenced deliberating, and as a\n\npractical  matter,  once  the   jury  has  been  disbanded  after\n\nreturning a verdict, it  can never be called back to  receive the\n\ncorrected charge that the  trial court might have given  if asked\n\nat the right time to do so.\n\n          Failure to exercise the right to  object to the court's\n\ncharge  at the critical moment  prescribed by Rule  51 results in\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nthe loss of an  opportunity for review  under a standard no  more\n\nburdensome for  the appellant  than the harmless  error standard.\n\nUnless the reviewing court concludes that the charge has caused a\n\nmiscarriage of  justice or  has undermined  the integrity of  the\n\njudicial process,  the  charge is  treated  as having  an  effect\n\nclosely  analogous to  law-of-the-case doctrine, and  for similar\n\nreasons of policy and fairness of process.

If\n\nthe  trial  counsel  and the  trial  court  are  able to  fashion\n\ninterrogatories that disentangle law  from fact and ask the  jury\n\nall  of  the  purely   fact  questions  that  are   essential  to\n\ndetermining the outcome of  the case once the disputed  issues of\n\nlaw are finally resolved, the rights of the parties to jury trial\n\ncan be protected even  though a final decision on  critical legal\n\nissues is deferred to a later time.   If, however (either because\n\nof a preference for doing so or because of  a sense that there is\n\nno other practical option)  the trial court elects to  submit one\n\nor  more mixed law-fact questions to the jury, full protection of\n\nthe  rights of the parties to have  their dispute resolved by the\n\njury to whom the  case is first submitted weighs  compellingly in\n\nfavor of  the conclusion that applying  the use-or-lose principle\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nis  essential to  fair  process and  a  just disposition  of  the\n\ncontroversy.\n\n          We conclude that no  party in this case is  entitled to\n\nhave  any  of  the alleged  errors  it  presents  in this  appeal\n\nconsidered under the  harmless error  standard of Rule  61.   The\n\nreason is that each appellant and cross-appellant now complaining\n\nof some  aspect of  the  charge to  the jury  had  the right  and\n\nopportunity  to state  its contention  to  the trial  judge after\n\ncompletion  of the  judge's charge  (including the  trial judge's\n\nmodification of  the charge after hearing objections)  -- and did\n\nnot  use  it.   Having  failed to  make a  timely  objection, the\n\ncomplaining party is entitled  to relief only to prevent  a clear\n\nmiscarriage of justice  or otherwise to preserve the integrity of\n\nthe judicial process.  In  most instances, nevertheless, we  have\n\ndetermined in our review of the  record before us that we are not\n\nin \"grave  doubt,\" as defined in  O'Neal v. McAninch, 115  S.

In each of those  instances, since we have determined that\n\nthe alleged error  was harmless,  it follows a  fortiori that  no\r                                                                  \n\nmiscarriage of justice has occurred.\n\n          Before explaining the  relevant characteristics of  the\n\nrecord before us that lead to our conclusion, we pause to explain\n\nwhy two kinds  of precedents do not apply to  the kinds of claims\n\nof  error before  us  here.   First,  an additional  standard  of\n\nappellate review  was  invoked to  allow  new contentions  to  be\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nconsidered on the merits,  in \"special circumstances,\" in Newport\r                                                                           \n\nv. Fact  Concerts, Inc.  453 U.S.  247, 256  (1981).  That  case,\r                                 \n\nhowever,  is easily  distinguished  from the  present appeal;  it\n\ninvolved  equitable   relief   and  did   not   involve   alleged\n\ninfringements of the rights of parties,  in a case tried before a\n\njury, to have disputed fact questions finally decided by the jury\n\nempaneled to try the case.\n\n          The  second   kind  of  inapplicable  precedent   is  a\n\ndevelopment under  the rubric  of \"waiver.\"   In  criminal cases,\n\nprecedents  have  added  a  distinctive  element  to  procedural-\n\npreclusion analysis  by recognizing that in  some instances, even\n\nwhen the  court is satisfied  that \"plain  error\" was  committed,\n\nstill the  appealing party  may be  barred by circumstances  that\n\nconstitute \"waiver.\"  In Olano the Court stated:\r                                        \n\n          Waiver is different from forfeiture.  Whereas\n          forfeiture is the failure to make the  timely\n          assertion   of   a  right,   waiver   is  the\n          \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of\n          a  known  right.\" ...   Whether  a particular\n          right is waivable; whether the defendant must\n          participate personally in the waiver; whether\n          certain procedures are  required for  waiver;\n          and  whether the  defendant's choice  must be\n          particularly   informed  or   voluntary,  all\n          depend  on  the  right  at  stake....    Mere\n          forfeiture,  as opposed  to waiver,  does not\n          extinguish an  \"error\" under Rule  52(b) ....\n          If  a  legal  rule  was  violated during  the\n          District  Court  proceedings,   and  if   the\n          defendant did not waive the rule, then  there\n          has  been an  \"error\" within  the meaning  of\n          Rule  52(b) despite  the absence of  a timely\n          objection.\n\nMarder, slip op. at 13 (quoting Olano, 133 S.

Because in  this case  we have concluded  that we  are\n\nsatisfied that correction  of the errors called to  our attention\n\nwould not have  affected the verdict,  in any event, we  need not\n\nconsider whether \"waiver\" in  the Olano sense may be  extended to\r                                                 \n\nthe civil context  (and might  then be an  additional reason  for\n\nconcluding that appellants  (and cross-appellants) cannot prevail\n\non this appeal).   \"Forfeiture\" in the Olano  sense is a  concept\r                                                      \n\nquite similar  to principles underlying enforcement of timeliness\n\nrequirements.  We next  turn to applying those principles  to the\n\nclaims of error asserted in this appeal.\n\n                    IV.  ERROR IN INSTRUCTIONS\r                              IV.  ERROR IN INSTRUCTIONS\n               ON SCARFO'S SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\r                         ON SCARFO'S SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\n\n          As  noted  in  Part  II.A  above,  the  instruction  on\n\nScarfo's sex discrimination claim was flawed  in its treatment of\n\nthe issue of causation  because it understated plaintiff's burden\n\nof proof.\n\nIs the  effect of the error  so egregious as  to warrant reversal\n\neven though  defendants did  not object  at the  time and  in the\n\nmanner prescribed by Civil Rule 51?  Because we conclude that the\n\njury  would  have  reached the  same  verdict  even  had it  been\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nproperly instructed, the  error was harmless.   Thus, it  readily\n\nfollows that no  miscarriage of  justice or other  blight on  the\n\njudicial process has resulted from the error.\n\n          The  evidence  of  discrimination  is  powerful.     It\n\ncontains numerous examples of Cabletron's different treatment  of\n\nScarfo and her male  colleagues who were similarly situated.   On\n\nthe other hand, it is also true that some evidence  in the record\n\ntends to  support defendants'  theory that Scarfo  was fired  for\n\nlegitimate  business reasons.   In  these circumstances,  we must\n\nexplain the evidence of record in somewhat greater detail.\n\n          Of  course,  a  jury  is   not  required  to  credit  a\n\nplaintiff's evidence, even if the evidence is uncontradicted, and\n\nneither are we.   But a realistic assessment of the likelihood of\n\na different verdict in this case, had different instructions been\n\ngiven,  depends  in part  on an  examination  of the  strength of\n\nScarfo's  evidence  and  the  findings  it  would  support.    We\n\nsummarize that evidence.\n\n          The strongest evidence on record supporting defendants'\n\ntheory  was  the  review  of  Scarfo  by  Brian  Miller, Scarfo's\n\nimmediate supervisor  at Cabletron.    Miller's report  contained\n\nseveral  positive  comments.    But  negative  remarks  regarding\n\nScarfo's management  and purchasing skills dominated  his review.\n\nMiller  also   reported  internal  discipline  problems   in  the\n\npurchasing department.\n\n          The  evidence on  record supporting  plaintiff Scarfo's\n\ntheory, however, is overwhelming.\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\n          First, Scarfo's requests to improve her department were\n\noverlooked while the  same requests made by  her male replacement\n\nwere  granted.    After  Scarfo  was hired  as a  buyer and  then\n\npromoted to purchasing  supervisor, she was  told that she  would\n\nnot be eligible for a raise until July 1988.  Scarfo continued to\n\nreceive a  buyer's salary, though she performed all the functions\n\nof a  supervisor.  But in this position she was repeatedly denied\n\nrequests  to  hire additional  buyers,  train  staff, and  update\n\nequipment so that she could focus on her managerial duties.\n\n          After  Scarfo  was   terminated,  Justin  O'Connor,   a\n\npurchasing  manager,  was  allowed  to  hire  additional  buyers,\n\nupgrade equipment,  implement training programs,  and make  other\n\nimprovements that Scarfo  had previously been  refused permission\n\nto make.  Further, unlike Scarfo, O'Connor was permitted to limit\n\nhis  buying responsibilities so that he could devote more time to\n\nhis managerial responsibilities.\n\n          Second,  when  the  purchasing  department moved  to  a\n\nlarger  space, Scarfo  was  denied an  office  although her  male\n\ncolleague was given a  separate office.  Craig Benson,  the chief\n\noperating officer at Cabletron,  did not want Scarfo to  have her\n\nown office.  Benson, however, knew that Tim Jacobs, who was hired\n\nwith Scarfo, would have a separate office.\n\n          Third,  Scarfo's business trip  expenses were carefully\n\nexamined.  In contrast,  the expenses of a male colleague who was\n\non  the  same trip  were  not questioned.    Specifically, Benson\n\nexamined Scarfo's expense vouchers  for a two-week business trip.\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nHe  did not  review expense  vouchers of  Roger Lawrence,  a male\n\nemployee who went on the same trip and whose expenses were nearly\n\nidentical to those of Scarfo.\n\n          Fourth, Benson singled out Scarfo to take the blame for\n\nan over-purchase of circuit boards, although other employees were\n\ninvolved with this transaction.   Scarfo had ordered the  boards,\n\nbut the boards  were subsequently  not needed.   Although  Benson\n\nknew that others  besides Scarfo were responsible for  this over-\n\npurchase, he  told Miller, \"I don't like  being ripped off, and I\n\nblame Jeanne Scarfo for this.\"\n\n          Fifth,  Scarfo was treated  differently with respect to\n\nstock  options.   Despite  Benson's explanation  that Scarfo  was\n\nomitted from the stock option list and his promise that she would\n\nbe on the next list of stock recipients,  Scarfo, unlike her male\n\ncounterparts, never received any stock options.\n\n          Sixth, in  addition to  the evidence of  these poignant\n\nexamples of disparate treatment, correlated with gender, there is\n\nin the  record other strong  evidence of discrimination.   Scarfo\n\noffered evidence that in April 1990, Benson told Miller to hire a\n\n\"guy\"  for her  position, but  Miller refused.   Benson  said, \"I\n\ndon't  care if you fire  or demote her, but I  want a guy in that\n\nposition.\" Approximately ten days later, Miller was fired.\n\n          After Miller's  departure, Scarfo was demoted  to buyer\n\nbut was asked to continue to perform all management functions.\n\n          In  October 1990,  when  Justin O'Connor  was hired  as\n\npurchasing manager, Benson told  him that he did not  like Scarfo\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nand urged O'Connor to fire her.  Only ten days after he came onto\n\nthe  job, O'Connor wrote a  negative review of  Scarfo and placed\n\nher on probation through February 1991.\n\n          O'Connor terminated Scarfo on January 10, 1991, a month\n\nbefore  the probationary period  expired.  His  reason for firing\n\nScarfo  was   her  failure   to  show   improvement.     In   the\n\ncircumstances, it would have been difficult  for O'Connor to make\n\na reasonable determination as to whether Scarfo's performance had\n\nimproved  because Scarfo's  time records  indicated that  she was\n\nlegitimately absent during her probation period.\n\n          Taking  into account  the  weight of  this evidence  of\n\ndiscrimination,  we   conclude  that   the  error  in   the  jury\n\ninstructions  on Scarfo's Title VII  claim was not  an error that\n\n\"seriously affected  the fairness, integrity or public reputation\n\nof judicial  proceedings,\"  Lash,  943 F.2d at  152, or caused  a\r                                          \n\nmiscarriage of justice, Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1269.\r                                         \n\n          We  conclude also  that no  other  basis exists  in the\n\ncircumstances of this case to  warrant an exception from applying\n\nthe use-or-lose  proposition stated in Rule 51  and explained, in\n\nPart  III  of this  Opinion, as  a  principle aimed  at achieving\n\noutcomes of jury trial that are fair and just on the merits.\n\n                 V.  SCARFO'S EQUAL PAY ACT CLAIM\r                           V.  SCARFO'S EQUAL PAY ACT CLAIM\n\n          By instructing  the jury  that plaintiff merely  had to\n\nshow disparity of treatment  between the sexes and  not sex-based\n\ndiscrimination, and by failing  to instruct on statutory defenses\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nincluded in the EPA, the trial court erred.\n\n          The EPA reads in relevant part:\n\n          No  employer  ...   shall  discriminate   ...\n          between  employees  on  the basis  of  sex by\n          paying wages to employees ...  at a rate less\n          than the  rate at  which [the  employer] pays\n          wages to  employees of the  opposite sex  ...\n          for  equal work  on jobs  the performance  of\n          which  requires  equal  skill,   effort,  and\n          responsibility, and which are performed under\n          similar working conditions, except where such\n          payment  is made pursuant  to (i) a seniority\n          system; (ii)  a merit system; (iii)  a system\n          which  measures  earnings   by  quantity   or\n          quality of production; or (iv) a differential\n          based on any other factor other than sex.\n29 U.S.C.   206(d).\n\n          The  evidence  of  record  overwhelmingly   supports  a\n\nfinding for  plaintiff (even under  a legal standard  of intended\n\nsex-based  discrimination,  had  the  instruction  so  required).\n\nDefendants had the right  and opportunity to object to  the trial\n\ncourt's instruction and tell  the trial judge how to  correct the\n\nerror.  As defendants did not use the right, we review the record\n\nbefore us only for evidence of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n          In  addition to  the  evidence summarized  in Part  IV,\n\nabove,  we note additional support  in the record  for the jury's\n\nfinding on the EPA claim.\n\n          Scarfo's economic expert testified that he reviewed and\n\nprocessed  Cabletron  data  on  pay  increments,  education,  and\n\nemployment  history.   His analysis  showed a  $14,000 difference\n\nbetween  male   and  female   pay  for  Cabletron   managers  and\n\nsupervisors.  The program accounted for education and seniority.\n\n          Further, the  evidence in  the record before  the jury,\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nand before us,  includes data  from personnel files  for men  and\n\nwomen holding similar positions.   For example, at the  same time\n\nCabletron  hired Scarfo, it hired Tim Jacobs.  Unlike Scarfo, who\n\nwas paid a starting salary of $27,000, Jacobs was given the title\n\nof supervisor and paid a starting salary of $35,000.\n\n          Moreover, in 1990,  Cabletron hired Justin  O'Connor as\n\npurchasing manager at a salary of $65,000.\n\n          In  an   attempt  to  justify  this   pay  discrepancy,\n\ndefendants  call attention  to  evidence that  O'Connor had  more\n\neducation and  vastly greater experience than Scarfo.   Given the\n\nstrength of the evidence supporting the EPA claim, however, it is\n\nvery  unlikely that  the  jury would  have  returned a  different\n\nverdict had the  error in the  instruction been corrected  before\n\nthey deliberated.\n\n      VI.  SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM\r                VI.  SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM\n\nA.   The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for\r          A.   The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for\n     Instruction\r               Instruction\n\n          Scarfo presents on appeal  a contention that she frames\n\nas  a single  alleged error  in  the charge  to the  jury on  her\n\nhostile environment claim.  In our  view, however, the contention\n\nraises two  issues that,  though interwoven and  related, involve\n\ndistinct points,  neither of which  was clearly expressed  in the\n\nobjection before the trial court.\n\n          First,   Scarfo  argues   that  the   court   erred  in\n\ninstructing  the  jury that  Scarfo  had  to prove  \"unreasonable\n\ninterference  with her  work performance\"  as an  element  of her\r                                                                   \n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nclaim.\n\n          Second, Scarfo  argues, at  least implicitly,  that the\n\ncourt  should  have  instructed  that  in  order  to   show  such\n\ninterference, the  plaintiff  did  not need  to  prove  that  her\n\ntangible productivity had declined,  but only that the harassment\n\nso  altered her working conditions  as to make  it more difficult\n\nfor her to do the job.\n\n          Defendants argue  that the  objection, quoted  from the\n\ntranscript  in  Part  II.C  above,  lacked  the  specificity  and\n\ndistinctness required by Rule 51 to preserve for appeal any issue\n\nregarding the instructions to the jury on the hostile environment\n\nclaim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.\r                     \n\n          We conclude that  the language of the objection is less\n\nexplicit than a well-crafted objection  should be.  Although  the\n\nobjection was  sufficient to inform  the trial court  that Scarfo\n\ncontended  she was entitled to a \"factors\" instruction as part of\n\nthe  Title VII charge, it failed to proffer a correct instruction\n\nor  in any  other way  to explain  how the  alleged error  in the\n\ncharge  could  be  corrected.    Also,  the  objection  failed to\n\nidentify explicitly  the second of  the two issues  stated above,\n\nand to explain how the alleged error could be corrected.\n\n          Plaintiff  Scarfo's objection  thus fell  short of  the\n\nclarity  and precision required to  alert the trial  judge to the\n\ncontentions  now advanced  on  appeal.   It  matters not  whether\n\nScarfo  had by that time  formulated the contentions  as they are\n\nnow  argued   (rather  than  developing   them  through   further\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nreflection during  later proceedings,  either in the  trial court\n\nafter verdict,  or on appeal).  In any event, the trial court was\n\nnot alerted to the contentions now advanced.\n\n          We  discuss the  two  related but  separable issues  in\n\nturn.\n\nB.   \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element\r          B.   \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element\n\n          Plaintiff  Scarfo  says that  the  court  erred in  its\n\ninstruction  to the  jury  that the  plaintiff  must prove  by  a\n\npreponderance of  the evidence  an abusive work  environment that\n\n\"unreasonably  interfered with her  work performance.\"  Plaintiff\n\nargues, citing Harris, that \"unreasonable interference\" was not a\r                               \n\nseparate  element of the claim  (failure to prove  which would be\r                           \n\nfatal  to the claim),  but only a  factor to  be considered along\n\nwith all other relevant factors in determining whether an abusive\n\nwork environment had been proved.\n\n          In Scarfo's favor,  we accept the point that  the terms\n\n\"element\" and \"factor\",  as they appear in  judicial opinions and\n\ncommentaries, often signify a key difference between two types of\n\nlegal tests prescribed by law,  for use by decisionmakers (juries\n\nor  judges), in determining whether the  evidence in a particular\n\ncase satisfies the requirements for a legal theory (of a claim or\n\ndefense).\n\n          One  type   of  legal  test  prescribes   two  or  more\n\n\"elements\"  of  a  claim or  defense.    Each  \"element\" must  be\n\nsatisfied.   Failure  to  satisfy  any  one  among  two  or  more\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\n\"elements\" is fatal  to the claim or defense  for which the legal\n\ntest was prescribed by law, even if all other elements are proved\n\nbeyond doubt.\n\n          The other  type of  legal test  prescribes that two  or\n\nmore \"factors\" are to be weighed and evaluated in making a single\n\n\"evaluative\"  determination  that takes  account  of  all of  the\n\nevidence  bearing on  all  of the  \"factors.\"   Weakness  of  the\n\nshowing of one factor, or  even total failure to show it,  is not\n\nfatal;  a strong  showing as  to other  factors may  outweigh the\n\ndeficiency.\n\n          Whatever the  law may  have been previously,  Harris v.\r                                                                        \n\nForklift Sys., 114 S.  Ct. 367 (1993),  leaves no doubt that  the\r                       \n\nlegal test prescribed by Title VII, as interpreted by the Supreme\n\nCourt, is, in part at least, a factors-type test.\n\n          Whether  an  environment   is  \"hostile\"   or\n          \"abusive\"  can be determined  only by looking\n          at all the  circumstances, which may  include\n          the frequency of the  discriminatory conduct;\n          its  severity;  whether   it  is   physically\n          threatening   or   humiliating,  or   a  mere\n          offensive    utterance;   and    whether   it\n          unreasonably  interferes  with an  employee's\n          work  performance....   [W]hile psychological\n          harm, like any other  relevant factor, may be\n          taken  into  account,  no  single  factor  is\n          required.\n\nId.  at  371.   Thus,  that  discriminatory conduct  unreasonably\r             \n\ninterferes  with  the  plaintiff's  work performance  is  not  an\n\nelement,  proof of  which  is  essential,  but  a  factor  to  be\r                                                                   \n\nconsidered  in determining  whether  an  \"abusive\"  or  \"hostile\"\n\nenvironment has been proved.\n\n          The legal test set  forth in Harris is in  fact neither\r                                                       \n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nentirely  an  \"elements\"  test  nor entirely  a  \"factors\"  test.\n\nInstead, the Harris test has both elements and factors within it.\r                             \n\nFirst,  it is comprised of several \"elements\" -- each alone fatal\n\nto  the claim if not satisfied.   One of these \"elements\" is that\n\nthe work environment was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"\n\n          Second, the test (or \"sub-test,\" one may prefer to say,\n\nto distinguish between the overall test and the internal test for\n\none  \"element\") for determining whether one of the \"elements\" has\n\nbeen satisfied is a  \"factors\" type of test.   More specifically,\n\none  of  the  elements  of  the Harris  test  is  proof  that the\r                                                \n\nenvironment  in  which  the  plaintiff worked  was  \"hostile\"  or\n\n\"abusive.\"   And the test  (or sub-test) for  determining whether\n\nthis  \"element\"  has been  satisfied in  a  particular case  is a\n\n\"factors\"  test.   The  passage from  Harris, quoted  immediately\r                                                      \n\nabove, identifies  both of these two characteristics of the legal\n\ntest set forth by the Court in that case.\n\n          This  reading of the  Opinion for a  unanimous Court is\n\nreinforced by the Concurring Opinions  of both Justice Scalia and\n\nJustice Ginsburg.  Justice Scalia noted that\n\n          \"[o]ne  of  the  factors  mentioned   in  the\n          Court's  nonexhaustive  list  -- whether  the\n          conduct   unreasonably  interferes   with  an\n          employee's  work performance -- would,  if it\n          were made an  absolute test, provide  greater\n          guidance to juries and  employers.  But I see\n          no  basis  for  such   a  limitation  in  the\n          language of the statute.\n\nId. at 372 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Justice Ginsburg, using the\r             \n\nword  \"dominantly\" rather  than an  absolute or  conclusive term,\n\nalso  recognized  that   \"unreasonable  interference  with   work\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nperformance\" was  not alone  decisive  as to  whether an  abusive\n\nenvironment exists.

It did\r                                \n\nnot  acknowledge  that the  Harris test  is  in some  respects an\r                                            \n\n\"elements\" test,  one element being that the work environment was\n\nhostile or abusive.  Thus, the trial judge was not alerted to why\n\nhis use of the language of an \"elements\" test in the charge might\n\nbe error because  of the particular  way he used it,  even though\n\nlanguage such as his would be  proper and even essential as  part\n\nof an entirely correct instruction.\n\n          Second, the  objection did not  correctly formulate the\n\nHarris \"element\" over which there was dispute and satisfaction of\r                \n\nwhich must  be  determined by  a  \"factors\" test  (or  sub-test).\n\nThus, even  if the trial judge  understood plaintiff's contention\n\nthat some  aspect, at  least, of  the overall  Harris test  was a\r                                                               \n\n\"factors\" test  (or sub-test) for deciding  whether one \"element\"\n\nwas satisfied, still the objection did not formulate that element\n\nclearly enough to tell the trial judge how to correct the alleged\n\nerror  in  his  instruction.   That  \"element,\"  as  now  clearly\n\nformulated  on appeal,   is  not \"unreasonable  interference with\n\nwork performance.\"  It is, instead, that the work environment was\n\nhostile or abusive.\n\n          In general, objections to a trial judge's charge to the\n\njury must be clear enough  and explicit enough to tell the  trial\n\njudge what  the party wishes the  trial judge to say  in order to\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\ncorrect the alleged error.\n\n               See Linn v.  Andover Newton  Theological\r                                                                 \n          Sch.,  Inc., 874  F.2d 1 (1st  Cir. 1989)(\"If\r                               \n          there is a problem with the instructions, the\n          judge must be told precisely what the problem\n          is,  and  as importantly,  what  the attorney\n          would consider a satisfactory cure.\").\n\nFor the reasons stated above, we conclude that plaintiff Scarfo's\n\nobjection  was not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal in\n\naccordance with Rule 51.   Since the plaintiff  failed to make  a\n\ntimely objection, we will reverse or award a new trial only if we\n\ndetermine,  based on  our review  of the  record, that  the error\n\nresulted in a miscarriage  of justice or \"seriously affected  the\n\nfairness,  integrity   or  public  reputation  of   the  judicial\n\nproceedings.\"  Lash v.

Harris, however,  does  not prescribe  a\r                                         \n\nparticular instruction  on what constitutes a  hostile or abusive\n\nwork  environment.  Rather, it  clearly implies that  its list of\n\nfactors is nonexhaustive.\n\n               See Harris, 114 S.  Ct. at 371 (\"Whether\r                                   \n          an environment is \"hostile\" or  \"abusive\" can\n          be  determined  only by  looking  at  all the\n          circumstances,   which    may   include   the\r                                                           \n          frequency of the discriminatory  conduct, its\n          severity    . . . .\")(emphasis added).\n\nWe have  no basis  for concluding now  -- if,  indeed, Scarfo  is\n\nasking  us to  do so  -- that  the jury  interpreted  the court's\n\ninstruction to mean that \"unreasonable interference\" was the only\n\nfactor they were allowed to consider in determining the existence\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nof a hostile or abusive environment.  Also, we have  no basis for\n\ndetermining  that   the  jury,  in  deciding   whether  the  work\n\nenvironment  was hostile or abusive, did not consider, as part of\n\ntheir  understanding of  the  instruction, factors  such as  \"the\n\nfrequency  of the  discriminatory  conduct; its  severity;  [and]\n\nwhether it is physically threatening.\"  Id.  We  conclude that it\r                                                     \n\nis  very  unlikely  that the  jury,  if  it  had been  instructed\n\ncorrectly, would  have returned  a different verdict.   Thus,  no\n\nmiscarriage of justice occurred.\n\n          In  summary, we  are left  with no  good reason  not to\n\napply the use-or-lose principle in view of the lack of clarity of\n\nthe objection made by Scarfo at the time prescribed by Rule 51.\n\nC.   Meaning of \"Unreasonable Interference With Work Performance\"\r          C.   Meaning of \"Unreasonable Interference With Work Performance\"\n\n          Plaintiff-Appellant  Scarfo  raises  a second,  related\n\nissue  with  respect to  the  court's instruction  on  her sexual\n\nharassment  claim.  She  argues that the  court's instruction was\n\nerroneous  because  it  required  the   jury  to  find  that  the\n\nplaintiff's work  performance was inadequate  and that  harassing\r                                                      \n\ndiscriminatory conduct was a cause of that inadequacy.  Plaintiff\n\nasserts  on  appeal that  she never  intended  to prove  that the\n\nquality  or quantity of her work performance declined as a result\n\nof her treatment; the plaintiff's theory of her case was that she\n\ncontinued to perform well  despite the sexual harassment.   Thus,\n\nshe contends that the court's instruction precluded the jury from\n\nconsidering her theory that the discriminatory conduct  adversely\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\naffected  her  work  conditions,  but  not  the  quality  of  her\n\nperformance.\n\n          Was Scarfo's objection to the trial court sufficient to\n\nalert the court to the refinement of her theory of  the case that\n\nshe now argues before us?\n\n          The relevant portion of her objection stated:\n\n          And we  had requested in our Jury Instruction\n          22 a  paragraph that  was not given  but that\n          comes from  the recent Harris case  that says\n          that you don't have to have the  unreasonable\n          interference with  the work performance.   It\n          can be harassment that  affects psychological\n          well-being and detract[s] from one's work and\n          we would like to have that instruction given \n          . . . .\n\n          Plaintiff's counsel's  use  of the  phrase  \"detract[s]\n\nfrom one's work\" was not sufficient to apprise the trial court of\n\nthe  plaintiff's  contention that  there  was no  decline  in her\n\nproductivity and instead only a  hostile or abusive alteration of\n\nher working conditions,  over which she had  the wit and will  to\n\ntriumph, thus performing up to full productivity.\n\n               See United States v.  Slade, 980 F.2d 27\r                                                    \n          (1st  Cir.  1992)(passing  allusions are  not\n          adequate to preserve an  argument in either a\n          trial or appellate setting);\n               Linn, 874 F.2d at 5.\r                             \n\nAlthough  plaintiff-cross-appellant's brief in  this court points\n\nto Justice Ginsburg's discussion of this issue in her concurrence\n\nin Harris v. Forklift, Justice Ginsburg's discussion was not  the\r                               \n\nsubject of  any of the  plaintiffs' proposed instructions  in the\n\ntrial  court.   Plaintiff's  proposed  Jury  Instruction 22  does\n\ninclude a paragraph from  the Opinion for the unanimous  Court in\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nHarris, but that paragraph does not speak to this issue.\r                \n\n          The  trial judge  could not  be expected  to glean  the\n\nsubstance  of  the present  argument  from  plaintiff's counsel's\n\nstatements and requests.   Thus, the  plaintiff failed to  object\n\nspecifically on this ground as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.\n\n          Plaintiff Scarfo correctly  notes that Justice Ginsburg\n\nmade a statement in  her concurrence in Harris that  supports the\r                                                        \n\nargument plaintiff now makes.\n\n          To  show  such  interference, \"the  plaintiff\n          need not  prove  that  his  or  her  tangible\n          productivity has declined as a  result of the\n          harassment.\"   It  suffices to  prove  that a\n          reasonable    person     subject    to    the\n          discriminatory  conduct  would  find, as  the\n          plaintiff did, that the harassment so altered\n          working  conditions  as  to  \"make   it  more\n          difficult to do the job.\"\n\nHarris   v.  Forklift,  114   S.  Ct.   at  372   (Ginsburg,  J.,\r                               \n\nconcurring)(quoting Davis  v. Monsanto  Chem. Co., 858  F.2d 345,\r                                                           \n\n349  (6th Cir. 1988), cert.  denied, 490 U.S.  1110 (1989)(a case\r                                             \n\nconcerning race-based discrimination)).   But it is also relevant\n\nthat  Justice   Ginsburg's   explanation  of   the   meaning   of\n\n\"unreasonable  interference\"  was neither  expressly  adopted nor\n\ndisavowed by the Opinion for the unanimous Court.\n\n          For the  reasons  stated  below,  we have  no  need  to\n\ndecide,  and refrain from deciding,  whether, had a more explicit\n\nobjection been made, the trial court should  have adopted Justice\n\nGinsburg's interpretation of \"unreasonable interference with work\n\nperformance.\"\n\n          Even  if we assume that the quoted passage from Justice\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nGinsburg's concurrence is also the view of the Court, we conclude\n\nthat  plaintiff Scarfo has not met her  burden of showing that an\n\nexception to  the use-or-lose  principle should be  invoked here.\n\nThe  trial court's instruction  on plaintiff's  sexual harassment\n\nclaim did not elaborate  on the phrase \"unreasonable interference\n\nwith work  performance.\"  That  instruction did not  preclude the\n\njury  from  considering the  theory  of her  case  that plaintiff\n\nScarfo now emphasizes  -- the theory that her  working conditions\n\nhad been unreasonably altered even though her performance was not\n\naffected.    Justice  Ginsburg's  concurrence treats  the  phrase\n\n\"interference with the plaintiff's work performance\" as including\n\nan alteration of the  working conditions that makes it  harder to\n\ndo  the job.  Nothing in any  of the opinions in Harris suggests,\r                                                                 \n\nas  plaintiff now  does  on  appeal,  that  this  phrase  can  be\n\ninterpreted  to mean only a tangible decline in productivity.  In\r                                   \n\naddition,  the  plaintiff  has  not  shown   any  basis  for  our\n\nconcluding that the particular instruction at issue in this case,\n\neither as a whole or in part, gave the jury the impression that a\n\ntangible decline in productivity  was something the plaintiff was\n\nrequired to prove as an element of her claim.\n\n          Viewed another way, plaintiff's  argument on appeal  is\n\nthat the  trial court  should have  given an instruction  stating\n\nthat the plaintiff can  prove unreasonable interference with work\n\nperformance either (1) by proving that the discriminatory conduct\n\nwould cause the quality or quantity of a reasonable person's work\n\nto decline  and the plaintiff's  work did so  decline; or (2)  by\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nproving  that a  reasonable person,  subjected to  the harassment\n\nthat she proved, would  find, and the plaintiff did so find, that\n\nthe harassment so altered  working conditions as to make  it more\n\ndifficult  to  do  the job.    If  Scarfo  thought that  such  an\n\ninstruction would  have been helpful to  the jury's understanding\n\nof her claim, Scarfo had the right and opportunity to make such a\n\nrequest.    No  such request  was  made  at  the critical  moment\n\nprescribed by Rule 51.\n\nD.   Plaintiff Scarfo's Argument  That the  Evidence Compelled  a\r          D.   Plaintiff Scarfo's Argument  That the  Evidence Compelled  a\n     Finding for Her\r               Finding for Her\n\n          Appellant  Scarfo  argues,   alternatively,  that   the\n\nevidence  in support  of her  claim of  sexual harassment  was so\n\noverwhelming as to compel a verdict in her favor.\n\n          We do not reach the merits of her contention,  however,\n\nbecause she  did not  preserve the issue  for appeal.   She could\n\nhave preserved the  issue by moving for  judgment as a matter  of\n\nlaw under Rule 50,  or by moving for a  new trial under Rule  59.\n\nSee Wells Real Estate v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n803, 810 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955 (1988) (waiver of\r                                           \n\nthe right  to  request  judgment as  a  matter of  law  does  not\n\npreclude a party from moving for a new trial).  Her failure to do\n\neither is fatal to her appeal on grounds of sufficiency or weight\n\nof the evidence, as was made clear in Wells.\r                                                     \n\n               We  do   not  reach  the  issue  of  the\n          sufficiency of  the  evidence .  . .  because\n          plaintiff's  counsel  failed  to move  for  a\n          judgment notwithstanding the  verdict in  the\n          district  court.

The only  strictly legal\n\nquestion raised by her  appeal on the harassment claim,  however,\n\nis the propriety of the jury instruction.  We have addressed that\n\nmatter in Part VI.B and VI.C, supra.\r                                             \n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\n          Her alternative argument that  the evidence compelled a\n\nverdict in  her favor  -- although  a contention  \"of law\" --  is\n\nplainly  based  on  assertions  about the  \"sufficiency\"  of  the\n\nevidence.  This kind of contention is controlled by Wells.\r                                                                   \n\n          Appellant also argues that a substantial policy  reason\n\nmitigates against  a conclusion that  she has failed  to preserve\n\nher\n\ncontention for appeal.  She maintains that if this court requires\n\nevery party to  file a motion for new trial  as a prerequisite to\n\nappeal,  then even  parties who  prevail on  all of  their claims\n\nexcept one -- and decide against appealing the minor loss -- must\n\nmove for a new trial in anticipation of filing a cross-appeal  if\n\nthe  other  party  should  appeal.   Such  post-trial  procedure,\n\nappellant  urges us  to  conclude, would  unnecessarily clog  the\n\ndocket.\n\n          Appellant  first raised  this  policy  argument in  her\n\nreply brief, affording  appellees no opportunity to respond.   In\n\nany  event, it  is unconvincing.   At  least  where, as  here, no\n\nsatisfactory   explanation  has  been  advanced  for  appellant's\n\nfailure to  seek a new trial, we  conclude that it is appropriate\n\nfor us  to take account  of the fact  that trial counsel  had the\n\nopportunity to decide,  and may  in fact have  decided, that  the\n\npotential costs of a new trial outweighed the potential benefits.\n\nShe  could  have  eased to  some  extent  the burdens  of  such a\n\ndecision at the post-trial stage, by moving for new trial only as\n\nan alternative to a  motion for judgment as a matter  of law.  In\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\nany event, it would  plainly be inconsistent with the  letter and\n\nspirit  of Rule 59 to give her a second opportunity to seek a new\n\ntrial now when she did  not use the opportunity available to  her\n\nat the time prescribed by Rule 59.\n\n          We have also considered  whether the recent decision in\n\nLebr n v. National R.R.  Passenger Corp., 115 S. Ct.  961 (1995),\r                                                  \n\nmight  salvage Scarfo's right to  complain of this  error at this\n\ntime.   We conclude that it does not, for reasons that apply also\n\nto  another claim of error (one advanced by defendant Benson), as\n\nexplained in Part IX, infra.\r                                     \n\n             VII.  MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\r                       VII.  MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\n\n          Miller  argues  that the  court  erred  in refusing  to\n\ninstruct  on nonpecuniary  damages.   Cabletron responds  that in\n\nfact  the court did instruct on this subject.  The record reveals\n\ngood reason for confusion over this matter.\n\n          During  a  colloquy  with  counsel before  the  closing\n\narguments, the court stated its intention to instruct the jury on\n\n\"enhanced compensatory damages,\" and not to instruct the jury  on\n\n\"nonpecuniary damages.\"  Miller's  counsel objected at this point\n\nto the  omission of an  instruction on nonpecuniary  damages, and\n\nthe court  expressly restated  its intention  not to instruct  on\n\nnonpecuniary damages.\n\n          Miller's counsel, in  reliance on  the court's  ruling,\n\nargued  in  his  closing  that  the jury  should  award  enhanced\n\ncompensatory damages.  Miller's counsel did not argue to the jury\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n\nthat it should award nonpecuniary damages.\n\n          When  the  court instructed  the  jury  just after  the\n\nclosing arguments, it instructed on nonpecuniary damages, but did\n\nnot instruct the jury on enhanced compensatory damages.  This was\n\nthe opposite of the court's previously stated intention.\n\n          After the  court's instruction  in  this way,  Miller's\n\ncounsel  objected -- ostensibly, to apprise the court of the fact\n\nthat  the  court's  instructions   had  varied  from  its  stated\n\nintention.  Miller's counsel  requested that  \"the Court  reverse\n\nthose two consistent with what you described this morning.\"  This\n\nstatement  can reasonably  be  interpreted as  a  request for  an\n\ninstruction  on  enhanced  compensatory  damages  to  replace the\r                                                                       \n\ninstruction  on nonpecuniary  damages.  Thus,  Miller's counsel's\n\nstatement arguably indicated to the judge that Miller had changed\n\nhis position since his original request.\n\n          Following  this colloquy,  the court  re-instructed the\n\njury  on  the wrongful  discharge claim.    This time,  the court\n\ninstructed the jury on enhanced compensatory damages, but did not\n\nwithdraw its  earlier instruction on nonpecuniary  damages, or in\n\nany other way mention nonpecuniary damages.  No further objection\n\nwas made by Miller's counsel.\n\n          It  is not  clear from  the record  whether  the second\n\ninstruction was intended to substitute for the first instruction,\r                                                \n\nor  was intended  as  an  additional  instruction.    The  latter\r                                              \n\ninterpretation  is supported by the form of the verdict, in which\n\nthe jury  was instructed  to answer special  questions, including\n\n                               -45-\r\r\n\nthe damages questions referred to below.\n\n          The  jury awarded  Miller  $995,000 in  damages on  the\n\nwrongful discharge claim,  but awarded no \"enhanced  compensatory\n\ndamages.\"   See  Jury Verdict,  Questions 4 and  5.   Although no\r                         \n\nquestion on the verdict form specifically addressed \"nonpecuniary\n\ndamages,\"  Question 4,  which  refers to  damages generally,  may\n\nreasonably  have  been  construed by  the  jury  to include  both\n\npecuniary and nonpecuniary damages.\n\n          In  these  circumstances,   the  instructions  and  the\n\nverdict  form did not preclude the jury from considering an award\n\nof   nonpecuniary  damages  in   accordance  with   the  original\n\ninstruction,  and the jury's award of  $995,000 may have included\n\nsuch  an award.    Thus,  the  verdict  form  together  with  the\n\ninstructions does not conclusively demonstrate that, as plaintiff\n\nMiller  urges,  the  jury was  not  instructed  on  the issue  of\n\nnonpecuniary damages.\n\n          Even  if  we were  to conclude  that  the jury  was not\n\ninstructed on nonpecuniary damages, counsel's failure  to object,\n\nafter the  \"substitute\" instruction was given, is  an obstacle in\n\nthe  way  of  Miller's  asserting  error  with  respect  to  this\n\ninstruction  on appeal.   Moreover,  Miller's  counsel's apparent\n\nreversal of his  position -- although arguably intended merely to\n\napprise the court of its inconsistency -- weighs against allowing\n\nMiller to assert his original position on appeal.\n\n          In addition  to these  obstacles is another.   Although\n\nplaintiff argues that the availability of nonpecuniary damages in\n\n                               -46-\r\r\n\na  wrongful  discharge  action  is an  open  question,  defendant\n\nCabletron  argues that  nonpecuniary  damages  are not  available\n\nunder New Hampshire state law in a wrongful termination case.\n\n          See Monge v.  Beebe Rubber Co., 316 A.2d 549 (N.H.\r                                                  \n     1974)(noting   that   nonpecuniary   damages  are   not\n     available  in  contract  actions,  and  holding  in the\n     context of a wrongful termination claim based on breach\n     of  contract that  the  plaintiff had  not proved  such\n     damages).\n\nSince the most that  can be said for Miller is that this issue is\n\nan open question under New Hampshire state law, it is not certain\n\nthat the trial court's  charge, in whatever way it  is construed,\n\nwas contrary to New Hampshire law.\n\n          In   these  circumstances,   we   conclude   that   the\n\ncontroversy over  this potentially disputable issue  of state law\n\nhas not been properly preserved for decision on this appeal.  The\n\nerror, if any, did not result in a miscarriage of justice.\n\n              VIII.  CABLETRON'S AND BENSON'S APPEAL\r                        VIII.  CABLETRON'S AND BENSON'S APPEAL\n               OF MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\r                         OF MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\n\n          Appellants  Cabletron  and  Benson  ask  this court  to\n\nvacate that part of the district court's judgment making an award\n\nto  plaintiff  Miller on  his claim  under  state common  law for\n\nwrongful  termination.   Appellants  argue that  we should  do so\n\neither on the ground that New Hampshire would not permit a common\n\nlaw  claim for  wrongful  discharge or  on  the ground  that  the\n\ndistrict court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n          Appellants also ask that we set aside the damages award\n\nand  remand the case for a new trial with appropriate guidance to\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\nthe district court on  the scope of damages.  This is in effect a\n\nreiteration  of  the argument  that  the  jury should  have  been\n\ninstructed under  New Hampshire statutory law  rather than common\n\nlaw because,  as  appellants concede,  the  principal  difference\n\nbetween the two  -- at least in the context of this case -- is in\n\nthe scope of the remedies available.\n\n          Alternatively, appellants ask  that this court  certify\n\nthe determinative  question  of  state  common  law  to  the  New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court.\n\n          Appellants contend that  this claim  should never  have\n\nbeen submitted to  the jury because New  Hampshire's human rights\n\nlaws,  see N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.   354-A,  provides the exclusive\r                    \n\nremedy  for  a  claim  of  retaliatory  discharge  based  on  sex\n\ndiscrimination.  Appellee Miller responds that appellants did not\n\nproperly  preserve the issue for  appeal and that,  in any event,\n\nthe cited statute does not provide an exclusive remedy.\n\n          Appellants acknowledge that they never  objected to the\n\ncourt's instruction  to the jury on the question of damages.  The\n\nfirst time appellants gave the trial judge notice of the argument\n\nnow  advanced on  appeal was  in a  post-judgment motion  seeking\n\nvarious  forms of relief, including vacatur of judgment and a new\n\ntrial.\n\n          Appellants  contend  that  they  raised  the  issue  of\n\nstatutory   exclusion   of  common   law   remedies   for  gender\n\ndiscrimination  in a  motion for  summary judgment.   Appellants,\n\nhowever, did  not \"squarely and distinctly,\"  see Rivera-G mez v.\r                                                                        \n\n                               -48-\r\r\n\nde Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988), raise on the merits\r                   \n\nin their motion for  summary judgment the issue of  the exclusion\n\nby statute of a common law wrongful termination remedy for gender\n\ndiscrimination.   Moreover, even if we were to hold that they had\n\ndone so, still,  in seeking relief from this court  they face the\n\nobstacle that they failed to move on this ground,  under Rule 50,\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.  In\n\nview of  this failure to bring the matter to the attention of the\n\ntrial court after the close of the evidence at trial, their claim\n\nof error  on this  ground is  not available  for  review under  a\n\nstandard  as  favorable  to  appellants  as  the  harmless  error\n\nstandard.    See  Eastern   Mount.  Platform  Tennis  v.  Sherwin\r                                                                           \n\nWilliams, 40 F.3d 492, 497 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                  \n\n          Even if the damages award for Miller's  state law claim\n\nwas based on  a legal premise  that may not  be the way  this New\n\nHampshire substantive-law  issue is eventually resolved,  at some\n\nfuture time, it does not follow that the judgment based upon that\n\nlegal premise was a  miscarriage of justice.  The  only prejudice\n\nthat appellants purport to show was an award of damages for pain,\n\nsuffering, and mental  anguish that, they argue,  is precluded by\n\nthe   absence  of   nonpecuniary  damages   from   the  statutory\n\nspecification of exclusive remedies.  Even were we to accept this\n\nassertion, and  hence conclude  that plaintiffs were  not legally\n\nentitled to  damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish, the\n\npoint remains that the record contains evidence of other elements\n\nof damages -- evidence more compelling than any evidence of pain,\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\nsuffering,  and anguish.   Nor  is there  any showing  that pain,\n\nsuffering, and  anguish were  emphasized by Miller  in presenting\n\nhis claims  to  the jury.    Finally,  there is  some  doubt,  as\n\nexplained above, see Part VII, whether the jury could be expected\n\nto  understand the charge  as instructing  that they  could award\n\ndamages  for  pain and  suffering.   At  best, the  suggestion of\n\nprejudice is quite speculative.\n\n          For these  reasons, we  do not consider  on the  merits\n\nappellants'  argument  for vacating  that  part  of the  judgment\n\nmaking an award to  Miller on his claim for  wrongful termination\n\nunder state common law.  Nor do  we give further consideration to\n\ncertifying  a question to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire when\n\nappellants are procedurally barred from raising on the merits the\n\nvery issue on which they seek certification.\n\n          We also do not  consider whether we should vacate  this\n\npart  of the  judgment  on the  ground  that the  district  court\n\nimprovidently  exercised  supplemental jurisdiction.   Appellants\n\ndid not  brief this  issue on  appeal, see Brown  v. Trustees  of\r                                                                           \n\nBoston  University,  891 F.2d  337,  352 (1st  Cir.  1989), cert.\r                                                                           \n\ndenied, 496 U.S. 937 (1990), and in any event are  precluded from\r                \n\nraising the issue by  their failure to object to  the instruction\n\non the wrongful termination claim.\n\n     IX.   DEFENDANT BENSON'S APPEAL OF THE TITLE VII CLAIMS\r               IX.   DEFENDANT BENSON'S APPEAL OF THE TITLE VII CLAIMS\n\n          Appellant Benson  asks this  court to vacate  the Title\n\nVII  liability findings against him  in favor of  both Scarfo and\n\n                               -50-\r\r\n\nMiller  and  to determine  that  the district  court  should have\n\ndismissed the Title VII claim against him because, as a matter of\n\nlaw, an individual cannot be liable under Title VII.\n\n          Benson  squarely  raised this  issue  in  a motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment  filed  against  plaintiff  Miller.   Appellant\n\nBenson concedes that he did not seek summary judgment against the\n\nother plaintiff, Scarfo,  on this ground.   He contends,  though,\n\nthat  the district  judge's  later  consolidation of  plaintiffs'\n\ncases and express  order that the defendants'  motion for summary\n\njudgment in the Miller case be  transferred to the main case  and\n\nconsidered re-filed  in that case, rendered  the summary judgment\n\nmotion applicable to plaintiff Scarfo.  We decline to accept this\n\ncontention.     To  accept  it  would  imply  that  it  would  be\n\nappropriate to enter summary judgment  against a party who  never\n\nhad  explicit notice  that  her opponent  had  moved for  summary\n\njudgment   against  her.     Therefore,   we  consider   Benson's\n\ncontentions  only as  they apply  to his  appeal of  the judgment\n\nagainst him for his retaliatory firing of Miller.\n\n          After  the  trial  court  denied  Benson's  motion  for\n\nsummary judgment  as to  Miller's claim  of individual  Title VII\n\nliability,  Benson did  not raise  the issue  again in  the trial\n\ncourt on a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Thus,\n\nthe claim of error by  the trial court in concluding, as  a basis\n\nfor   denying  summary   judgment,  that   Miller  may   be  held\n\nindividually liable is not available for  review under a standard\n\nas favorable to appellants  as the harmless error standard.   See\r                                                                           \n\n                               -51-\r\r\n\nEastern Mount. Platform Tennis, 40 F.3d at 497.\r                                        \n\n          The instruction on Benson's individual  liability under\n\nTitle VII  may or may not  have been erroneous.   The trial judge\n\nmade  clear that  on this  point he  was adopting  the view  of a\n\ndistrict court of  this circuit,  and arguably the  view of  some\n\ncircuits, over the plainly  contrary view of other circuits.   As\n\nwas true  of the issue of  municipal liability under  42 U.S.C.  \n\n1983 in Newport v. Fact Concerts,  Inc., 453 U.S. 247 (1981), the\r                                                 \n\ncourt's interpretation  of the  \"contours of  . .  . [individual]\n\nliability under\" Title VII  in this case \"hardly could  give rise\n\nto plain judicial error  since those contours are currently  in a\n\nstate of evolving definition and uncertainty.\"  Id. at 256.\r                                                             \n\n          In these circumstances, this ruling of law by the trial\n\ncourt,  to which no objection  was taken until  after verdict, is\n\nclosely analogous to, if not precisely within, the concept of the\n\nlaw of the case.  See Moore v. Murphy, No. 94-1974, slip op. at 6\r                                               \n\n(1st Cir. Feb. 1, 1995).  See also Part III, supra.\r                                                            \n\n            X.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW OF DAMAGES AWARDS\r                      X.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW OF DAMAGES AWARDS\n\n          With respect  to  plaintiffs'  Title  VII  claims,  all\n\nparties  stipulated before  trial that  the jury  would determine\n\nliability and the court would calculate damages, if necessary.\n\n          With  respect to  plaintiff  Miller's  claim under  New\n\nHampshire state  law for wrongful discharge,  the jury determined\n\nboth liability and damages.  Similarly, with respect to plaintiff\n\nScarfo's  claim under the Equal Pay Act, the jury determined both\n\n                               -52-\r\r\n\nliability and damages.\n\n          The district  court, in its calculation  of damages for\n\nthe Title VII claims, made certain findings of  fact as the basis\n\nfor the awards.  This court sets aside such findings only if they\n\nare \"clearly erroneous.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n          This court  may, however, modify  an award made  by the\n\ndistrict court when the record is sufficiently developed that the\n\nCourt  of  Appeals  can  apply  the  law  to  the  trial  court's\n\nfactfindings on the record and calculate the proper award without\n\nresorting to remand.   Cf. Lipsett v.  Blanco, 975 F.2d  934, 943\r                                                       \n\n(1st  Cir.  1992)(modifying  an  award  of  fair  and  reasonable\n\nattorneys'  fees when  the trial  court made  a legal  error with\n\nrespect to the method of calculation).\n\n          Parts XI-XV  of this Opinion explain  our resolution of\n\nthe distinct issues that various defendants raise with respect to\n\nthe amounts of the several awards.\n\n      XI.   PLAINTIFF SCARFO'S PRINCIPAL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES\r                XI.   PLAINTIFF SCARFO'S PRINCIPAL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES\n\nA.  The Components of Scarfo's Claims\r          A.  The Components of Scarfo's Claims\n\n          Plaintiff  Scarfo was  awarded  damages on  two of  her\n\nclaims:  the Title VII sex discrimination claim and the Equal Pay\n\nAct claim.  We discuss each of these awards in turn.  To  aid the\n\nreader  in understanding the  damages analysis, we  note that the\n\nfollowing  dates  are  relevant  to Plaintiff  Scarfo's  damages.\n\nPlaintiff Scarfo was terminated  on January 10, 1991.   Plaintiff\n\nScarfo  filed a claim  with the EEOC  on March 6,  1991 and filed\n\n                               -53-\r\r\n\nthis  civil action with the court below  on October 8, 1991.  The\n\nfirst of the Orders that, together, constitute the final judgment\n\nin this case was entered on May 10, 1994.\n\n     1.  Title VII Claim\r               1.  Title VII Claim\n\n           The damages  awarded to plaintiff Scarfo  by the trial\n\ncourt  for her successful Title VII claim consist of three types:\n\nback pay, front pay, and  damages for the value of  stock options\n\nthat plaintiff did not receive as a result of the discrimination.\n\n          The  court awarded  plaintiff  Scarfo $1,187,901.07  in\n\ndamages for the  Title VII  violation (consisting of  the sum  of\n\n$242,407.07  in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for\n\nthe value of stock, reduced by the jury's award of $28,000  under\n\nthe Equal Pay Act).\n\n          The  term back pay  refers to lost  wages commencing on\n\nthe date two years before the plaintiff's filing with the EEOC to\n\nthe date of judgment.  Front pay refers to damages for wages from\n\nthe date of judgment to some specified date in the future.\n\n          The back pay and front pay damages awarded by the trial\n\ncourt are to  some extent  overlapping and must  be modified  for\n\nreasons explained in Part XI.C below.\n\n     2.  The Equal Pay Act Claim\r               2.  The Equal Pay Act Claim\n\n          The jury  awarded plaintiff  Scarfo $28,000  in damages\n\nfor  defendant Cabletron's violation of  the Equal Pay  Act.  The\n\ntrial court instructed the jury that \n\n          Under the  Equal Pay Act,  Ms. Scarfo's award\n          of unpaid wages is limited to a period of two\n\n                               -54-\r\r\n\n          years   prior  to  filing  this  lawsuit  and\n          extending  until  her termination  unless she\n          proves by  a  preponderance of  the  evidence\n          that the violation was  willful.  If you find\n          that  Cabletron  acted  willfully,  then  Ms.\n          Scarfo may  recover unpaid wages for a period\n          of  three years prior  to filing this lawsuit\n          and extending until her termination.\n\nCf. 29 U.S.C.   155.\r             \n\n          We  have  no need  to  decide,  and thus  refrain  from\n\ndeciding,  whether  this  instruction  on the  law  was  accurate\n\nbecause neither party  objected to the  instruction at trial  and\n\nneither has raised the issue before this court.\n\n          The special verdict form  does not indicate whether the\n\njury found that  the defendant's  violation was  willful.   Thus,\n\nassuming,  as  we  must,  that  the  jury  followed  the  court's\n\ninstructions,  the jury's  award represents  the damages  for the\n\ntime span from October 8 of either 1988 or  1989 up to January 10\n\nof 1991, when plaintiff Scarfo was terminated.\n\n          Neither  plaintiff  Scarfo   nor  defendant   Cabletron\n\nchallenges the jury's award  under the Equal Pay Act  of $28,000.\n\nThere is a  lack of  clarity in the  briefs and record,  however,\n\nabout  whether this recovery is  in addition to  the recovery for\n\nviolation  of Title VII.   We discuss this  issue in Parts XI.A.3\n\nand XI.E below.\n\n     3.   Combining to a Nonduplicative Total\r               3.   Combining to a Nonduplicative Total\n\n          The award under Title VII is to some extent duplicative\n\nof the award under the Equal Pay Act.\n\n          Apparently  to avoid  a duplicate  recovery, the  trial\n\n                               -55-\r\r\n\ncourt  subtracted the jury's award  of $28,000 for  the Equal Pay\n\nAct  violation  committed by  Cabletron  from  the court's  total\n\ncalculation of $1,215,901.07  (consisting of $242,407.07 in  back\n\npay, $744,744 in front  pay, and $228,750 for the  value of stock\n\noptions) in  damages  for the  Title VII  violation committed  by\n\nCabletron and  Benson, resulting in what the court determined was\n\nthe total Title  VII award  of $1,187,901.07  against Benson  and\n\nCabletron.\n\n          Thus, under the  final judgment entered in  the case by\n\nthe  court  below,  defendants  Cabletron and  Benson  were  held\n\njointly and severally liable for  $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII\n\nviolation and Cabletron was held liable for an additional $28,000\n\nfor the Equal  Pay Act  violation.  Since  Benson was not  liable\n\nunder the Equal  Pay Act,  there is a  problem about  subtracting\n\n$28,000  from  the  award  against Benson  to  avoid  duplicative\n\nrecovery.  We address this problem in Part XI.E below, along with\n\nthe need for other modifications.\n\n          Defendants  Cabletron and  Benson raise  arguments with\n\nrespect to all three components of  Scarfo's Title VII award.  We\n\ndiscuss each component in turn.\n\nB.   Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay\r          B.   Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay\n\n          As stated above, the court awarded Scarfo  back pay for\n\nthe  Title  VII  claim  in  the  amount  of  $242,407.07  (before\n\nreduction by $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act award).\n\n          Title VII  permits an  award of back  pay starting  two\n\n                               -56-\r\r\n\nyears before the date of the filing of plaintiff's complaint with\n\nthe EEOC  (two years before March  6, 1991) up until  the date of\n\njudgment.   42  U.S.C.    2000-5(g).   Thus, plaintiff  Scarfo is\n\nentitled to back pay  from March 6, 1989  to May 10, 1994.   From\n\nMarch 6, 1989  to the date of her termination,  January 10, 1991,\n\nthe damages represent the  amount that she was underpaid  because\n\nof discrimination on the basis of her sex.  From January 10, 1991\n\nto May 10,  1994, damages  represent the amount  she should  have\n\nbeen paid,  if she had  not been terminated  on the basis  of her\n\nsex.\n\n          The court  performed  a detailed  set  of  calculations\n\nbased  on   evidence  admitted   at  trial  and   awarded  Scarfo\n\n$242,407.07 in back pay  (before reduction to avoid duplication).\n\nSee Addendum to Court's Order of May 9, 1994.  These calculations\r             \n\nseparate  the time  period for  back pay  into the  relevant sub-\n\nperiods  and use the salary  rate of an  arguably equivalent male\n\nemployee  (as a proxy for what plaintiff Scarfo would have earned\n\nin the  absence of discrimination)  to calculate the  damages for\n\neach day  of each sub-period.  Although  defendants raise several\n\narguments with  respect to these calculations,  we determine that\n\nthe  court's findings of fact are not \"clearly erroneous\" and the\n\nmethod  of performing  the  calculations was  in accordance  with\n\napplicable law.\n\n          In  particular,  the  defendants  criticize  the  trial\n\ncourt's use of the salaries of two other Cabletron employees, Mr.\n\nO'Connor  and Mr. Jacob,  in the calculations.   Defendants argue\n\n                               -57-\r\r\n\nthat the trial court erred in comparing plaintiff Scarfo to these\n\ntwo   employees  because   these   two   employees  had   greater\n\nresponsibilities at  Cabletron.  This argument  fails because the\n\ntrial court  reasonably could have determined  that Scarfo either\n\nhad  a similar level of  responsibility or would  have been given\n\nsimilar responsibilities but for discrimination.\n\n          The  court calculated  damages  up until  May 4,  1994,\n\nonly, instead of May 10, 1994.  No party, however, has raised any\n\nissue on appeal regarding this  period of approximately one week,\n\nand  we do  not disturb  the trial  court's calculations  in this\n\nrespect.\n\nC.  Scarfo's Front Pay Award\r          C.  Scarfo's Front Pay Award\n\n          The court awarded Scarfo  $744,744 as front pay.   In a\n\nTitle  VII case, the court has discretion to award front pay from\n\nthe date of judgment  forward when reinstatement is impracticable\n\nor impossible.\n\n          See Goss v.  Exxon Office Sys. Co.,  747 F.2d 885,\r                                                      \n     890 (3d  Cir. 1984)(\"The award of  future lost earnings\n     in Title VII cases is an alternative to the traditional\n     equitable remedy of reinstatement.\");\n          Cf. Wildman  v. Lerner  Stores, 771 F.2d  605 (1st\r                                                  \n     Cir. 1985)(court has same discretion to award front pay\n     under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).\n\nThis court will disturb  a trial court's front pay award  only if\n\nwe conclude that the  trial court abused its discretion,  or that\n\nfindings  of  fact  on which  the  award  was  based are  clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n          The  trial  court, in  its Order  of  May 10,  made the\n\n                               -58-\r\r\n\nfinding  that  plaintiff  Scarfo  did  not  have  \"the  option of\n\nreturning  to  her  former  position at  Cabletron.\"    Defendant\n\nCabletron  does not  challenge  this finding,  nor is  it clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n          The  court  also  found  that plaintiff  Scarfo  \"is  a\n\ndisplaced  worker  and  will   be  unable  to  find  professional\n\nemployment in the future.\"    Although defendants  challenge this\n\ndetermination,  the  record shows  that  the  court heard  expert\n\ntestimony on the  likelihood that plaintiff Scarfo  would be able\n\nto find an  equivalent job with the  same earning potential.   In\n\nlight of the evidence that  she had only a ten percent  chance of\n\nreturning to full employment at an equivalent salary, the court's\n\nfinding  that   Scarfo  will  be  unable   to  find  professional\n\nemployment in the future is not clearly erroneous.\n\n          Defendants  also argue  that  the  \"court imported  the\n\nerroneous  concept of displaced worker into the case.\"  The court\n\ndid  not explain the meaning  of \"displaced worker,\"  nor has our\n\nattention been  called to  any published  opinion that  uses this\n\nterminology in the Title  VII context.  In any  event, regardless\n\nof  the  terminology used,  plaintiff  Scarfo's  ability to  find\n\nsimilar  employment in the future  is relevant both  to the trial\n\ncourt's decision to  award front  pay and to  the calculation  of\n\nsuch an award.  The  trial court did not abuse its  discretion in\n\nawarding front pay to the plaintiff.\n\n          In calculating  Scarfo's  front pay  award,  the  court\n\nadopted  the   calculations   of  plaintiff's   expert   witness.\n\n                               -59-\r\r\n\nDefendants do not dispute that these calculations were admissible\n\nand  were  adequately  explained   by  the  expert's  report  and\n\ntestimony; rather, they now question merely the weight  the court\n\ngave to this  evidence by  pointing out concessions  made by  the\n\nexpert during the cross-examination.  The defendants' contentions\n\nfail  because  the choice  by the  court,  as factfinder  for the\n\npurpose of calculating damages,  to give probative weight  to the\n\nexpert's calculations was not clearly erroneous.\n\n          In another respect, however, we conclude that the court\n\nerred  in adopting  and  using  the  expert's calculations  as  a\n\nmeasure of front pay.  The expert's calculation of damages in the\n\namount of  $973,494, which the  court adopted for  Scarfo's front\n\npay award,  was for a period  commencing on January 1,  1991.  As\n\nstated above, \"front pay\"  usually refers to an award  for future\n\nsalary payments starting  on the  date of the  judgment, in  this\n\ncase, May  10, 1994.  Since  the court, in addition  to its front\n\npay award, also awarded back pay for the time period up until the\n\ndate of the  verdict on  May 4, 1994,  plaintiff Scarfo  obtained\n\nduplicate damages for  the period from January 1, 1991  to May 4,\n\n1994.\n\n          \"[T]he law  abhors duplicative recoveries.   That is to\n\nsay,  a plaintiff  who  is injured  by  reason of  a  defendant's\n\nbehavior is,  for the most part, entitled to be made whole -- not\n\nto be enriched.\"  Dopp v. HTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 516 (1st  Cir.\r                                             \n\n1991).  The court adopted the expert's calculations for the front\n\npay award  and performed  its own calculations  to determine  the\n\n                               -60-\r\r\n\nback pay award.   Thus, the amounts of the front pay and back pay\n\nawards  representing the period from  January 1, 1991  to May 10,\n\n1994  are different  because  the expert  and the  court employed\n\ndifferent  methods to  calculate damages.   To  avoid duplicative\n\nrecovery, plaintiff Scarfo's combined  total of Title VII damages\n\nshould be reduced either by the amount the court  awarded as back\n\npay for the  period from January 1, 1991  to May 10, 1994,  or by\n\nthe amount the court ordered as front pay for that same period.\n\n          For  two  reasons  we   choose  the  latter  method  of\n\ndetermining the measure of the duplication that must be  avoided.\n\nFirst,  unlike  the court's  calculations  for  that period,  the\n\nexpert's calculations  include social security  contributions and\n\nfringe benefits.  Therefore, the amount derived from the expert's\n\ncalculations is a larger amount than the amount calculated by the\n\ncourt for that period.  Thus, it is more consistent with our goal\n\nof modification only as  needed to avoid duplicative  recovery to\n\ndecrease  the  total award  by the  smaller  amount, that  is the\n\namount  the  court  calculated  for back  pay  for  that  period.\n\nSecond,  since  the expert's  calculations  were  computed on  an\n\nannual  basis and  the court's  calculations were  computed on  a\n\ndaily basis, using the  back pay measure calculated by  the court\n\nfor the period from January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994 makes for an\n\neasier and more precise calculation of the duplication.\n\n          As stated above,  the trial court calculated  plaintiff\n\nScarfo's Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07 (before adjustment\n\nfor  the Equal Pay Act  award) consisting of  $242,407.07 in back\n\n                               -61-\r\r\n\npay, $744,744 in  front pay, and $228,750 for  the value of stock\n\noptions.   The portion of the court's back pay award attributable\n\nto the period for January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 is $224,013.12.\n\nThus, to avoid  duplication, we reduce the court's calculation of\n\nTitle VII damages by  $224,013.12, resulting in a back  pay award\n\nof $18,393.95  ($242,407.07 less $224,013.12), and a total sum of\n\nTitle VII  damages (before  adjustment with respect  to Cabletron\n\nfor  the  Equal Pay  Act  award)  of  $991,887.95, consisting  of\n\n$18,393.95  for the period up  to January 10,  1991, $744,744 for\n\nthe period  commencing January  10,  1991, and  $228,750 for  the\n\nvalue of stock options.  Both defendants Cabletron and Benson are\n\njointly and severally liable  for this amount.  This  amount does\n\nnot include the adjustment (discussed below in Part XI.E) for the\n\njury's Equal Pay Act award against Cabletron only.\n\nD.   Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options\r          D.   Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options\n\n          The court  awarded damages to plaintiff  Scarfo for the\n\nvalue  of stock  options she would  have received if  she had not\n\nbeen discriminated against on the basis  of sex.  The court found\n\nthat Scarfo would have been given options to purchase 2500 shares\n\nof stock at a purchase price of $15.50.  The court found that the\n\nvalue  of the stock was $107.00 per  share around the time of the\n\ntrial  and  awarded Scarfo  $228,750  in  damages ($107.00  minus\n\n$15.50 times 2,500).\n\n          Defendants raise only one argument with respect to this\n\ndamages award;  they say  that Scarfo is  barred from  recovering\n\n                               -62-\r\r\n\nthese damages on the  basis of res  judicata.  Before filing  the\n\ncivil  action in federal court,  Scarfo filed an  action with the\n\nNew Hampshire Department of Labor.  In that action, the plaintiff\n\nsought  to  recover compensation  under  N.H. Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  \n\n275:51.\n\n          See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   275:51 (authorizing the\r                       \n     Commissioner of the  New Hampshire Department of  Labor\n     to hold  hearings to enforce the  provisions of certain\n     New Hampshire labor laws).\n\nThe  Department  of  Labor  determined, inter  alia,  that  stock\r                                                             \n\noptions were  not \"compensation\"  and thus not  recoverable under\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   275:51.\n\n          In  her amended  complaint  to the  trial court  below,\n\nScarfo sought to recover lost wages and stock options on a breach\n\nof contract theory.   The district judge dismissed the  breach of\n\ncontract claim on the basis of res judicata because it stated the\n\nsame cause of action the  plaintiff had already adjudicated under\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   275:51.\n\n          Defendants assert that because the plaintiff was barred\n\nfrom recovering  damages  for stock  options  under a  breach  of\n\ncontract theory,  the plaintiff should be  barred from recovering\n\ndamages for stock  options under a  Title VII sex  discrimination\n\ntheory.  This argument lacks merit.  Under defendants' reasoning,\n\nthe  plaintiff would be barred  from recovering any  type of lost\n\ncompensation (including  wages) under Title VII,  because she had\n\nadjudicated a breach of  contract claim for lost wages  and other\n\ncompensation in  the Department of  Labor proceedings.   But  res\n\njudicata bars causes  of action, not types of damages recoverable\n\n                               -63-\r\r\n\nunder  some  other  claim  not  subject  to  adjudication  in the\n\ntribunal rendering the judgment.\n\n          See In Re Alfred P., 126 N.H. 628, 629 (1985)(\"The\r                                       \n     doctrine of res judicata  precludes the litigation in a\n     later  case of matters  actually litigated, and matters\n     that could  have been  litigated, in an  earlier action\n     between  the  same  parties   for  the  same  cause  of\n     action.\").\n\nPlaintiff's Title VII cause  of action is  not the same cause  of\n\naction as  her breach of  contract action; it  requires different\n\nelements  to be proved.  These different elements were not tried,\n\nand could not have been tried, in the New Hampshire Department of\n\nLabor  hearings.  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII claim is not\n\nbarred by res judicata.\n\n          Since  the defendants  raise  no  other arguments  with\n\nrespect to the  trial court's award of $228,750 for  the value of\n\nstock options not received by plaintiff Scarfo, we do not disturb\n\nthe trial court's award.\n\nE.   Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award\r          E.   Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award\n\n          As   described  above,   the  trial   court  originally\n\ncalculated  Title  VII  damages   to  be  $1,215,901.07.    Then,\n\nrecognizing  the need  to avoid  duplicative recovery,  the court\n\nsubtracted $28,000 for the Equal Pay  Act claim.  Thus, under the\n\nfinal  judgment  entered  by  the  court  (as  gleaned  from  the\n\ncollection of Orders referred to in Part II, supra) Cabletron was\r                                                            \n\nheld liable  for $1,187,901.07  for the  Title VII  violation and\n\n$28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.\n\n          Defendants argue  that the  court erred  in subtracting\n\n                               -64-\r\r\n\nthe Equal  Pay  Act award  from  the back  pay  component of  the\n\ncourt's Title  VII award.  We  agree that the method  used by the\n\ntrial court to avoid duplicate recoveries was at  best confusing,\n\nif not erroneous, for two reasons.  First, the back pay component\n\nof the Title VII damages award and the jury's Equal Pay Act award\n\nrepresent  damages  for different  time  periods.   Second,  only\n\ndefendant Cabletron  (and not  defendant Benson) is  liable under\n\nthe  Equal Pay  Act.   Thus,  we  make the  following  additional\n\nadjustment.\n\n          In Part XI.C above, our modification of the total Title\n\nVII damages resulted in a calculation of Title VII damages in the\n\namount of $991,887.95.   The remaining question before us  is how\n\nappropriately to modify this  award to avoid duplicative recovery\n\nby plaintiff Scarfo.\n\n          The  portion   of  our   modified  Title   VII  damages\n\ncalculation representing damages from March 6, 1989 to January 1,\n\n1991 is  $18,393.95.  The  jury's Equal Pay Act  award of $28,000\n\nrepresents damages for the  same injury, namely discrimination in\n\npay on the  basis of sex, for a period  commencing either October\n\n8, 1988 or October 8, 1989 and extending to January 10, 1991, the\n\ndate  of her termination.   Thus, regardless of  whether the jury\n\nfound willfulness, these time periods overlap to some extent.\n\n          We consider separately the two cases (the two different\n\nperiods, and as a result the two different methods of calculation\n\nto avoid an overlap).\n\n          If  the jury found wilfulness, the EPA award of $28,000\n\n                               -65-\r\r\n\nrepresents the period from  October 8, 1988 to January  10, 1991.\n\nThis time period is  longer than, and includes entirely  the time\n\nperiod  of March 6,  1989 to January  1, 1991,  for which damages\n\nwere  calculated  at   $18,393.95.    Thus,  if  the  jury  found\n\nwilfulness, the appropriate way  to avoid duplicative recovery is\n\nto  reduce the  Equal  Pay  Act  award  by  $18,393.95,  so  that\n\nCabletron is liable to  plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95  for the\n\nTitle VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay\n\nAct violation.\n\n          If  the jury did not find wilfulness, the Equal Pay Act\n\naward  of $28,000 represents the  period from October  8, 1989 to\n\nJanuary 10,  1991.  This is  a shorter time period  than the time\n\nperiod from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 for  which the judge\n\nawarded $18,393.95.  If we could determine that  the jury did not\n\nfind wilfulness,  the more accurate  adjustment we could  make to\n\navoid duplicative recovery would  be to reduce the Equal  Pay Act\n\naward  by  $12,367.55,   the  amount  of  the  Title   VII  award\n\nrepresenting damages from October 8, 1989 to January 1, 1991.\n\n          Since  we  cannot  determine  whether  the  jury  found\n\nwilfulness,  we   conclude  that  it  is   appropriate  in  these\n\ncircumstances  to  accept  the  reduction  of  $18,393.95  as  an\n\nappropriate adjustment to avoid overlap (instead of the reduction\n\nof $12,367.55).  If, in fact, the jury's award was not based on a\n\nfinding of wilfulness and accordingly  the appropriate adjustment\n\nis a reduction  of $12,367.55,  then the  prejudice to  plaintiff\n\nScarfo is quite small (i.e., $6,026.40) in comparison either with\n\n                               -66-\r\r\n\nher  total  recovery or  with  the cost  to  her, as  well  as to\n\nopposing parties and the public,  of a remand for a new  trial on\n\nthe sole issue of whether Cabletron's Equal Pay Act violation was\n\nwilful.   Having failed to request an explicit jury finding as to\n\nwilfulness,  Scarfo  is  in  no  position  to  complain  of  this\n\nresolution of the issue.\n\n          Thus,  after  the  reduction  of  $18,393.95  to  avoid\n\noverlap, Cabletron is liable  to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95\n\nfor the Title VII  violation and an additional $9,606.05  for the\n\nEqual Pay Act violation.\n\n          Since the Equal  Pay Act claim was  not brought against\n\ndefendant Benson,  Benson is liable  only for Title  VII damages.\n\nIn  accordance with the explanation  above, Benson is jointly and\n\nseverally  liable  to  Scarfo  for  Title  VII  damage  totalling\n\n$991,887.95  consisting  of  $18,393.95  for  the  period  before\n\nJanuary 10, 1991; $744,744 for the period after January 10, 1991;\n\nand $228,750 in stock options.\n\n          We  emphasize that these  adjusted calculations are not\n\nintended to alter the usual terminology and relevant time periods\n\nfor  damages under Title VII.   As explained  above, a successful\n\nplaintiff  (one who  has  proved liability  under  Title VII)  is\n\nentitled to back  pay for a Title  VII violation starting on  the\n\ndate two years before the plaintiff's EEOC  filing and continuing\n\nuntil the date of judgment.  A court, in its discretion, may also\n\naward front pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date of\n\njudgment and continuing to some specified date in the future.\n\n                               -67-\r\r\n\n                XII.   PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES\r                          XII.   PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES\n\n          The jury  found defendants Cabletron and  Benson liable\n\nto plaintiff  Miller under  Title VII for  retaliatory discharge.\n\nThe  court  awarded  plaintiff  Miller $190,651.85  in  back  pay\n\nrepresenting lost compensation from the date of  his discharge to\n\nthe date of judgment.  The court awarded Miller $995,000 in front\n\npay purportedly  representing lost compensation from  the date of\n\njudgment forward.  The court also awarded Miller $206,060 for the\n\nvalue of stock  options that he  did not receive  because of  his\n\ndischarge.    These  three  calculations total  $1,391,711.85  in\n\ndamages for the Title VII violation.\n\n          The defendants  raise no arguments with  respect to the\n\ncourt's back pay award  of $190,651.85.  We discuss, in turn, the\n\ndefendants  arguments with respect  to the front  pay damages and\n\nthe damages for the value of the stock options.\n\nA.   Miller's Damages for Front Pay\r          A.   Miller's Damages for Front Pay\n\n          Defendants argue that the court's method of calculating\n\ndamages  for front  pay was  an abuse  of discretion.   The  jury\n\nawarded   plaintiff  Miller  $995,000  in  damages  for  Miller's\n\nwrongful  discharge claim  under  New Hampshire  state law.   The\n\ncourt, for a reason not stated, assumed that this sum represented\n\ndamages  for front pay only.   Thus, the  court incorporated this\n\nsum  of  $995,000  into the  court's  calculations  of  Title VII\n\ndamages as the damages for front pay.\n\n          As  stated above, we review a court's decision to award\n\n                               -68-\r\r\n\nfront  pay damages  under the  abuse-of-discretion standard.   We\n\nconclude that  the defendants are  correct in asserting  that the\n\ncourt's decision to use  the jury's figure of $995,000  for front\n\npay damages was an  abuse of discretion because the  jury's award\n\nmay have included some back pay, some amount for the value of the\n\nstock options, and some amount as damages for pain and suffering.\n\nPlaintiff  Miller, in  a post-trial  motion and  in his  brief as\n\nappellee, agrees that the court erred in this respect.\n\n          The  jury was  instructed  that if  it found  Cabletron\n\nliable   on  the state  law wrongful  termination claim,  it must\n\nconsider two types of damages:\n\n          First, you must determine the amount of wages\n          and  fringe  benefits  he  would  have earned\n          through  employment with  defendant Cabletron\n          . . . if  he had  not been discharged  on May\n          30th,  1990,  to  the date  of  your verdict.\n          Second,  you must  determine  the  amount  of\n          future   wages   and   fringe   benefits   he\n          reasonably   would   have   earned   in   his\n          employment with Cabletron if  he had not been\n          discharged.\n\nThis instruction clearly  permits the jury to award both back-pay\n\ndamages  and front-pay damages.  The verdict form did not require\n\nthe jury to report the  two separately.  The $995,000 awarded  by\n\nthe  jury is reasonably interpreted as an award for both back pay\n\nand  front  pay.   As  explained  above,  the  $995,000 may  have\n\nincluded,  also, damages for pain and suffering.  Thus, the court\n\nerred  in  using  the jury's  award  on  the  state law  wrongful\n\ntermination claim as the measure of front pay damages under Title\n\nVII.\n\n          At  trial, plaintiff  Miller's  expert  testified  that\n\n                               -69-\r\r\n\n$211,000  was  the  appropriate   award  for  front-pay  damages.\n\nPlaintiff Miller  has asked  this court,  in correcting  for this\n\nerror, to reduce the award for front-pay damages from $995,000 to\n\n$211,000, the  amount  calculated by  plaintiff Miller's  expert.\n\nDefendants  Cabletron and  Benson  argue that  this court  should\n\nvacate the entire  award for  front pay because  the trial  court\n\nabused its discretion  in deciding  to make any  award for  front\n\npay.\n\n          The court  below found that Miller  did make reasonable\n\nefforts to  procure employment, but that the  courier business he\n\nbegan in  1991 has not  yet made a  profit.  We  will not disturb\n\nthis finding of fact because the defendants have not shown it  to\n\nbe clearly erroneous.  From this finding, we infer that the court\n\nalso  found that  it was  impracticable for  Miller to  return to\n\nCabletron and that Miller  had made reasonable efforts to  find a\n\njob with the  same earning capacity.  Miller is  thus entitled to\n\ndamages for front pay.  The court's determination that Miller was\n\nentitled to an award of front pay was not an abuse of discretion,\n\nand we will not disturb that determination.\n\n          Plaintiff's proposal  to this  court that the  award be\n\nreduced from $995,000  to $211,000  -- if the  proposal had  been\n\nmade  to and  accepted  by the  trial  court --  has  evidentiary\n\nsupport in the testimony of plaintiff's expert.\n\n          This court has authority to modify a damages award when\n\nall the necessary factfindings have been made in the court below.\n\nCf.  Lipsett, 975  F.2d at  943 (modifying an  award of  fair and\r                      \n\n                               -70-\r\r\n\nreasonable attorneys'  fees when  the  trial court  made a  legal\n\nerror with respect to  the method of calculation).   Reducing the\n\naward to  $211,000, however, as plaintiff  Miller requests, would\n\nrequire this court to evaluate the credibility of the plaintiff's\n\nexpert and  to make a new finding of  fact, not made in the trial\n\ncourt, that Miller is  entitled to $211,000 in damages  for front\n\npay.\n\n          Since  we do not have the authority to make findings of\n\nfact  in order  to modify the  award in  the manner  requested by\n\nplaintiff, we vacate the front pay award.\n\n          We  remand this  case  to the  district  court for  the\n\nlimited  purpose of  determining  an appropriate  amount for  the\n\nfront pay award.   The district court, on  remand, may allow  the\n\ninterested parties a reasonable time period within  which to file\n\nwith the district court  a stipulation resolving this issue  (for\n\nexample, a stipulation  such as Miller's  proposal to this  court\n\nthat his award for front pay be reduced to  $211,000 and judgment\n\nbe  entered accordingly).   If  no such  agreement is  filed, the\n\ntrial court is to determine the amount of the award to Miller for\n\nfront pay.  The trial court may find it appropriate to act on the\n\npresent record of evidence  and adopt the plaintiff's calculation\n\nof $211,000 for  front pay.  It  may instead calculate front  pay\n\ndamages from the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) forward in  some\n\nother  manner supported by the present record of evidence.  Also,\n\nthe court, in  its discretion  and for cause  shown, may  receive\n\nadditional evidence bearing upon this issue.\n\n                               -71-\r\r\n\nB.   Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options\r          B.   Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options\n\n          During his employment, plaintiff  Miller was told that,\n\nover a specific period of  time, he would be given stock  options\n\nthat  would allow  him to  purchase 10,000 shares  of stock  at a\n\npurchase price of  $3.97 per  share.  During  his employment,  he\n\nreceived  options to purchase only 2,000 shares.  During the time\n\nperiod from the date of  his termination (April 20, 1990)  to the\n\ndate of judgment (May 10, 1994) Miller alleges that he would have\n\nreceived options to  purchase 5,000 shares.   Miller also alleges\n\nthat within a month of the date of judgment, his right to options\n\nwith respect  to the  remaining 3,000  shares would  have vested.\n\nThus,  Miller's counsel  argued  to the  trial court  that Miller\n\nshould have been  awarded damages  for the value  of options  for\n\n8,000 shares of stock.\n\n          The court awarded plaintiff  Miller $206,060 in damages\n\nfor the  value of  2,000  shares of  stock.   The  court did  not\n\nexplain how  it determined the  number 2,000 to be  the number of\n\nshares of stock.\n\n          Defendants-appellants, in their brief on appeal, do not\n\ndispute the facts, as alleged  by plaintiff Miller, regarding the\n\noptions  for  10,000 shares.    In  an effort  to  point out  all\n\npotential errors made by  the district court in support  of their\n\nargument that this court should vacate both awards entirely, they\n\nargue that the trial  court erred in deciding to award Miller the\n\nvalue  of 2,000 stock options.  Defendants suggest that the trial\r                         \n\ncourt mistakenly  thought that Miller had  already received stock\r                                                                     \n\n                               -72-\r\r\n\noptions for 8,000  of the 10,000 shares, when,  in fact, this was\n\nthe amount he had not received because of his termination.\r                                        \n\n          The  brief of  appellee  Miller agrees  that the  court\n\nerred, and suggests (adopting defendants' reasoning in part) that\n\nthe  court  should  have  awarded $824,240,  the  value  of stock\n\noptions for 8,000 shares.\n\n          The implications  of defendants' argument on appeal are\n\ntroubling.  They  have requested,  in the event  that this  court\n\ndoes not  reverse the  liability determination on  Miller's Title\n\nVII claim,  that this  court  set aside  Miller's entire  damages\n\naward  and remand.   If the remand  were limited to  trial of the\n\nissue of damages for the value of stock, however, the trial court\n\nmight award either the value of 5,000 shares of stock (the amount\n\nvesting  before  the date  of judgment),  or  the value  of 8,000\n\nshares of stock.   In  either case, the  probable consequence  of\n\nretrying only this issue would be an additional liability, beyond\n\nthat  already awarded by the  trial court, of  either $309,090 or\n\n$618,180 in favor of plaintiff Miller.\n\n          Miller's  brief as  appellee  requests that  this court\r                                                                     \n\naward  damages for the value  of stock options  for 8,000 shares.\n\nDefendants  respond that we should not  grant this request (which\n\nwould increase the total  damages award) because plaintiff Miller\n\ndid  not appeal the award of damages in his cross-appeal; rather,\n\nplaintiff Miller  raised this argument only in its appellee brief\n\nresponding to the defendants' appeal.\n\n          We  refrain from  modifying the  judgment to  award the\n\n                               -73-\r\r\n\nvalue of 8,000 stock options because to do so would require  this\n\ncourt  to  make  new findings  of  fact.   We  also  refrain from\n\nremanding this issue to  the trial court for the  limited purpose\n\nof determining an appropriate  award for the value of  lost stock\n\noptions because neither party has requested  that we do so.  Both\n\nparties have  requested that  this court  take  actions that  are\n\nbeyond this  court's authority.   Since neither  party's position\n\nhas merit, we simply  affirm the trial court's award  of $206,060\n\nfor the value of stock options for 2,000 shares of stock.\n\n                   XIII.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\r                             XIII.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\n\nA.  The Arguments of the Parties\r          A.  The Arguments of the Parties\n\n          There is some confusion  both in the record and  in the\n\nparties' briefs  about  whether  the  court  awarded  prejudgment\n\ninterest  on  any  part  of Scarfo's  damages  award  and whether\n\nprejudgment interest,  if awarded,  was appropriate.   Defendants\n\nargue  that the  court awarded  prejudgment interest  on Scarfo's\n\nTitle  VII  award, and  that this  was  error.   Plaintiff Scarfo\n\nargues that the trial court refused to award prejudgment interest\n\non Scarfo's Title VII award.\n\n          We  conclude from a review of the record that the trial\n\ncourt  denied prejudgment interest on every  element of the award\n\nto plaintiff Scarfo.   In  answer to  Question 6  of the  verdict\n\nform, the  jury  answered \"NO,\"  finding  against Scarfo  on  her\n\nprejudgment  interest claim.  By its Order  of July 20, 1994, the\n\ncourt stated as to all of  Scarfo's claims, \"Prejudgment interest\n\nis disallowed.\"\n\n                               -74-\r\r\n\n          With respect to the  judgment for plaintiff Miller, the\n\ndefendants have not raised  on appeal any objection to  the trial\n\ncourt's  award  of prejudgment  interest  on  Miller's state  law\n\nwrongful  termination  claim at  the rate  of  10% per  annum, as\n\nmandated  by N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    524:1-b and    336:1.  With\n\nrespect  to Miller's  Title  VII award,  however,  there is  some\n\nconfusion  in  the  parties'  briefs about  whether  the  parties\n\nunderstood  that the  court awarded  prejudgment interest  on any\n\npart of the award.   The parties' briefs assume  that prejudgment\n\ninterest was awarded  on the entire Title  VII award.   From this\n\npremise, the parties  dispute whether it was  appropriate for the\n\ncourt  to award prejudgment interest  on the front  pay award and\n\nthe  portion of the back  pay award representing  damages for the\n\nperiod from the date Miller's complaint was filed  to the date of\n\njudgment.\n\n          We  conclude from a review of the record that the trial\n\ncourt allowed  prejudgment interest  on Miller's state  law claim\n\nfor wrongful  termination, but not on any aspect of his Title VII\n\nclaim.  In its answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury\n\nanswered  \"NO,\" thus  finding  against Miller  on  his claim  for\n\nprejudgment interest.   But  in his Order  of July 19,  1994, the\n\ntrial  judge \"abrogate[d]\" that finding  insofar as it applied to\n\nthe state law claim for  wrongful termination and awarded  Miller\n\nprejudgment  interest from the date of filing of the complaint to\n\nthe date of the verdict.\n\n          Since, contrary  to the contentions of  the parties, we\n\n                               -75-\r\r\n\nhave  concluded that  the trial court  did not  award prejudgment\n\ninterest on  plaintiff Scarfo's and plaintiff  Miller's Title VII\n\nawards, the  only question remaining  is whether the  trial court\n\nerred  by  denying prejudgment  interest  on all  aspects  of the\n\nplaintiffs' Title VII awards.\n\n          A   trial  court   has  discretion  whether   to  award\n\nprejudgment interest on a successful Title VII claim.\n\n          See Earnhardt v.  Puerto Rico, 744 F.2d 1,  3 (1st\r                                                 \n     Cir. 1984)(in a Title VII case the question of \"whether\n     [prejudgment  interest   is]  necessary  to   make  the\n     plaintiff   whole  is  within  the  discretion  of  the\n     district court\").\n\nIn view of the discretion allowed the  trial court as to interest\n\non a Title  VII award, we conclude, in  the circumstances of this\n\ncase,  that the  trial  court did  not  abuse its  discretion  in\n\ndeclining to award prejudgment interest  on the Title VII  award.\n\nThus,  as stated  below in  the Conclusion,  we affirm  the trial\n\ncourt's  decision  not  to  award prejudgment  interest  on  both\n\nplaintiffs' Title VII claims.\n\nB.   Front Pay Awards\r          B.   Front Pay Awards\n\n          For an  additional reason, we affirm  the trial court's\n\ndenial of  prejudgment interest on  the front  pay components  of\n\nboth  plaintiffs'   Title  VII  damages  awards.     Interest  is\n\nordinarily awarded  to  compensate for  the  lost use  of  funds.\n\nSince  the  front  pay awards  represent  damages  for  wages the\n\nplaintiffs would have received  in the future, after the  date of\n\njudgment, the plaintiffs had  not lost use of these  funds before\n\n                               -76-\r\r\n\nthe judgment was ordered.\n\n          Cf.  Conway v.  Electro Switch  Corp., 523  N.E.2d\r                                                         \n     255,  258-59 (Mass.  1988)(prejudgment interest  is not\n     available under Massachusetts  law for awards of  front\n     pay   for   violations   of   a   Massachusetts   anti-\n     discrimination statute).\n\nMoreover,  the plaintiffs'  experts,  in calculating  damages for\n\nfront pay,  correctly chose to discount  the amounts representing\n\nthe plaintiffs' future wages  at an appropriate interest  rate in\n\norder  to determine  the present  value of  the future  stream of\n\nincome to which each plaintiff would have been entitled.\n\n          Thus, as stated in the Conclusion below, we affirm  the\n\ntrial court's  denial of  prejudgment interest  on the  front pay\n\ncomponents of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.\n\nC.   Awards for the Value of Stock Options\r          C.   Awards for the Value of Stock Options\n\n          In  this   case,  defendants  argue   that  prejudgment\n\ninterest should not be awarded on the value of the stock options,\n\nsince the amount of damages  was based on the price of  the stock\n\non or near the date of  judgment.  If the plaintiffs had received\n\nthe stock options  at the time due and had  not transferred them,\n\nthe plaintiffs would have  been in possession of shares  of stock\n\nhaving the value equal to the  purchase price plus the amount  of\n\ndamages.   Thus, the damages awards for the stock options already\n\nrepresent the present  value of the stock options  at the date of\n\njudgment.  We conclude  that an award of prejudgment  interest is\n\nnot  necessary   to  compensate  the  plaintiffs.     Although  a\n\nreasonable argument may  be made that prejudgment interest  is an\n\n                               -77-\r\r\n\nappropriate remedy for the loss of dividends that would have been\n\npaid to plaintiffs if  they had been in  possession of the  stock\n\nduring  the period  to which  they were  entitled to  it, neither\n\nparty has argued  this proposition.   Since both plaintiffs  have\n\nconceded either  explicitly (in Miller's case)  or implicitly (in\n\nScarfo's case, to the extent she argues that prejudgment interest\n\nwas not even awarded)  that prejudgment interest on the  value of\n\nthe  stock options is not appropriate, we refrain from addressing\n\nthe  argument  that  prejudgment   interest  may  be  awarded  as\n\ncompensation for lost dividends.\n\n          Thus, defendants and plaintiffs agree  that prejudgment\n\ninterest  was inappropriate on the damages  for stock options and\n\nwe affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the\n\nstock options components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.\n\n             XIV.   MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS\r                       XIV.   MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS\n\n          The  orders   of  the  district  court   that  we  have\n\ndetermined to  be the functional  equivalent of a  final judgment\n\nare  silent,  and thus  perhaps  ambiguous, with  respect  to the\n\neffect of the  overlap between the judgment  for plaintiff Miller\n\non  the jury  finding  of  damages  in  the  state  law  wrongful\n\ntermination claim and  the judgment for  plaintiff Miller in  the\n\ncourt's findings of  damages in  the Title VII  claim.   Separate\n\nawards  were made  for these  two claims,  but nothing  is stated\n\nexplicitly about whether and to what extent, and with what effect\n\non collectibility,  the elements  of harm for  which damages  are\n\n                               -78-\r\r\n\nawarded under the two claims overlap.\n\n          None  of  the  parties   brought  this  matter  to  the\n\nattention of the trial court.  Each party may have been reluctant\n\nto  do so for fear  the ambiguity would  then be resolved against\n\nit.   Having chosen  instead to argue  their respective positions\n\nonly  on appeal, however, no party  is in a favorable position to\n\nseek an award  of costs of appeal.   We award no costs  of appeal\n\nand cross-appeal  from the  judgment of the  district court  with\n\nrespect to Miller's claims.\n\n          To    eliminate   any   uncertainty,   we   state   our\n\ndetermination  of   the  meaning   of  the  judgment,   with  the\n\nmodifications we order.\n\n          Plaintiff Miller  prevailed on  two claims:   his state\n\nlaw  claim  for wrongful  discharge  against  Cabletron (and  not\n\nBenson) and his federal Title VII claim for retaliatory discharge\n\nagainst Cabletron and Benson.\n\n          Plaintiff Miller was awarded $995,000  with prejudgment\n\ninterest at  a rate of 10% per annum  from the date of the filing\n\nof the  complaint to the date of the verdict (May 4, 1994) on his\n\nNew Hampshire  state law  claim for wrongful  termination against\n\nCabletron.\n\n          After modification  by this court, plaintiff  Miller is\n\nentitled  to three  types  of damages  for  his Title  VII  claim\n\nagainst  Cabletron and Benson.  First, Miller is entitled to back\n\npay in the amount  of $190,651.85 (without prejudgment interest).\n\nSecond,  Miller is  entitled to  damages  for front  pay (without\n\n                               -79-\r\r\n\nprejudgment  interest).  As stated in Part XII.A supra, the trial\r                                                                \n\ncourt  will determine,  after proceedings  on remand,  whether to\n\naward $211,000 or some  different amount as the front  pay award.\n\nThird,  Miller  is  entitled  to  damages   (without  prejudgment\n\ninterest) for  the value of lost  stock options in the  amount of\n\n$206,060.\n\n          Since defendant Benson is liable on the Title VII claim\n\n(and not the state  law claim), Cabletron and Benson  are jointly\n\nand  severally liable  for  the total  amount  of the  Title  VII\n\ndamages only.\n\n          Although  defendant Cabletron was  found liable on both\n\nthe state law  and federal  law claims, plaintiff  Miller is  not\n\nentitled to collect on both claims.\n\n          See Freeman  v. Package Mach. Co.,  865 F.2d 1331,\r                                                     \n     1345  (1st Cir. 1988)(\"[P]laintiff  is entitled to only\n     one full recovery, no matter how many legal grounds may\n     support  the verdict  ...  but there  is  no basis  for\n     allowing  the  losing  party   to  pick  which  of  the\n     overlapped awards it prefers to pay.  In collecting the\n     fruits  of  his  victory,  [plaintiff]  was  concededly\n     entitled  to  only a  single slice  of  pie --  but the\n     choice of the slice was his.\").\n\nIn this case,  plaintiff Miller may choose the larger  of the two\n\ndamages awards.\n\n          If the total Title VII damages award is larger than the\n\naward  on  Miller's  state  law  claim  for  wrongful  discharge,\n\ndefendants  Cabletron and  Benson will  be jointly  and severally\n\nliable for the total of the Title VII damages.\n\n          If the damages award  on the state law  claim ($995,000\n\nplus prejudgment interest at the per annum rate of 10%) is larger\n\n                               -80-\r\r\n\nthan the total Title VII award (which, we note, will  be the case\n\nif  the parties  stipulate to  $211,000 as  the front  pay award,\n\nresulting  in a  total  Title VII  award  equal to  $607,711.65),\n\ndefendants  Cabletron and  Benson will  be jointly  and severally\n\nliable  for the  Title VII  damages award  and Cabletron  will be\n\nseparately liable  for the amount  of the award on  the state law\n\nclaim that is in excess of the Title VII award.\n\n                       XV.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\r                                 XV.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n          The status  of each plaintiff as a  prevailing party is\n\nnot challenged on appeal.   Appellants do challenge, however, the\n\nsize of each award of attorneys'  fees on the ground that it does\n\nnot account for plaintiff's failure to win at trial on all claims\n\noriginally made.\n\n          Plaintiff  Scarfo   prevailed  on  her   claim  against\n\nCabletron  and  Benson for  sex discrimination  and on  her claim\n\nagainst  Cabletron under the Equal Pay  Act.  She did not prevail\n\non her  claim of sexual  harassment against Benson  or Cabletron.\n\nHer  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress\n\nagainst Cabletron was dismissed,  and she lost on the  same claim\n\nagainst Benson  at trial.   Her claim  of breach of  contract was\n\ndismissed  on the ground of  res judicata.   The defamation claim\n\nwas not pressed at trial, apparently because it was settled.\n\n          Miller prevailed against  Cabletron and  Benson on  his\n\nTitle VII claim for  retaliatory discharge, and against Cabletron\n\non  his state-law wrongful  termination claim.   Although he lost\n\n                               -81-\r\r\n\nnone of his claims that went to the jury (except for  prejudgment\n\ninterest), Miller's  claims for abuse of  process and intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress were apparently dismissed before\n\nor  during trial, although on the record before us we cannot tell\n\nunder what circumstances or on what terms they were dismissed.\n\n          Following trial,  the court received briefs  and held a\n\nhearing  to determine attorneys' fees.  The court awarded fees to\n\nScarfo in the  amounts of  $225,300.13 for services  of the  firm\n\nthat handled the bulk of her case and $18,955 for the services of\n\na firm that  handled a small part of the case.  The court awarded\n\nfees to Miller in the amount of $117,510.97.\n\n          Appellants  assert  that  the  trial  court  improperly\n\nawarded Miller fees related to claims on which he did not prevail\n\nat trial -- apparently, the dismissed  claims of abuse of process\n\nand intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Yet appellants\n\nhave failed  to provide this  court with  a record from  which we\n\ncould  determine   whether  the   award  included  the   cost  of\n\nprosecuting these claims.\n\n          It  is  clear from  the  trial  court's order  awarding\n\nattorneys' fees to Miller that the court had before it a detailed\n\nbill for Miller's attorneys' services.  Appellants have  not made\n\nthat  bill,  or any  other  information sufficient  to  support a\n\nreasoned decision  by this  court, a part  of the  record.   This\n\ncourt therefore has no basis for determining whether there is any\n\ntruth to appellants'  assertion that the  fee award against  them\n\nincluded  the cost of litigating  claims on which  Miller did not\n\n                               -82-\r\r\n\nprevail at trial.   In these circumstances,  we do not reach  the\n\nquestion whether  the trial  court abused  its discretion  in its\n\naward  of fees for the simple reason that  we have no basis for a\n\nreasoned decision.\n\n          When an appellant fails to provide a record of evidence\n\nmaterial to the  point the  appellant wishes to  raise, and  thus\n\nleaves the appellate court  with an insufficient basis to  make a\n\nreasoned  decision,  the  court  in  its  discretion  may  either\n\nconsider the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or\n\nmay dismiss the  appeal if the absence  of a full  record thwarts\n\nintelligent and reasoned review.  See Moore, slip op. at 4.\r                                                     \n\n          Appellants  assert  that  the  district  court  did not\n\nreduce the  award  to  Scarfo to  account  for  her  unsuccessful\n\nclaims.  The support  for this assertion consists primarily  of a\n\nlisting  of  the  claims on  which  plaintiffs  did  not prevail.\n\nAppellants cite a statement of the  trial court in a related case\n\nin  which the court acknowledged that the Title VII and state-law\n\nclaims involved different defenses  and varying remedies, as well\n\nas  novel issues  of  state law.    Appellants also  assert  that\n\nplaintiffs  \"failed to  establish  entitlement to  the fees\"  and\n\n\"wholly  failed to explain many of the general entries which were\n\nmade.\"\n\n          At the  hearing, the  trial court heard  testimony from\n\nScarfo's lead  counsel regarding Scarfo's counsel  fees.  Counsel\n\ntestified that the proffered  itemized bill did not  include work\n\nrelating to the defamation  claim, or work solely related  to the\n\n                               -83-\r\r\n\nharassment  claim  or the  emotional  distress claim.    She also\n\ntestified that the fees for which her client sought reimbursement\n\nwere  $75,000  less than  the total  fees  charged.   Counsel was\n\nsubjected  to  fairly   detailed  cross-examination,   especially\n\nregarding the  fees attributable to the  sexual harassment claim;\n\ncross-examination on  that topic  focused especially on  fees for\n\nresearch undertaken on February 2 and February 5, 1993.\n\n          The court found that on these two dates, February 2 and\n\n5, 1993, research was undertaken on issues on which plaintiff did\n\nnot prevail, but  that \"the  issues are interwoven.\"   The  court\n\nstated that it  was reducing  the charges allowed  for those  two\n\ndays by 50% to $427.50.\n\n          An award of  fees under Title VII is reviewed primarily\n\nunder an  abuse  of discretion  standard, and  the trial  court's\n\nrange of  discretion is particularly broad.  See Phetosomphone v.\r                                                                        \n\nAllison Reed  Group, Inc., 984 F.2d  4, 6 (1st Cir.  1993).  That\r                                   \n\nrange extends to determining the portion of bills for services to\n\nbe awarded to parties who have  won on only some of their claims,\n\nas long as the trial court considers the relevant factors:\n\n          Where, as here, plaintiffs have won a federal\n          claim for which  attorneys' fees are  allowed\n          to a  prevailing party, the  question becomes\n          whether the claims on  which they lost in the\n          same  suit were  unrelated to  the successful\n          ones (in  which event no fees  may be awarded\n          for  work  on  the  unsuccessful  claims), or\n          whether, instead, the losing  claims included\n          \"a common  core of facts,\" or  were \"based on\n          related legal theories,\" linking them  to the\n          successful  claim.  In  the latter event, the\n          award may include compensation for legal work\n          performed on the unsuccessful claims.\n\n                               -84-\r\r\n\nGarrity  v. Sununu,  752 F.2d  727, 734  (1st Cir.  1984) (citing\r                            \n\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461  U.S. 424 (1983)).  Where  the district\r                              \n\ncourt  gives consideration  to  these factors,  we  defer to  its\n\njudgment absent an abuse of discretion.\n\n          See id. at 735;\r                           \n          see also Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 940 (1st\r                                              \n     Cir. 1992)  (the fee  in a case  involving interrelated\n     claims  is  an  \"equitable  judgment entrusted  to  the\n     discretion of the factfinder,  to be made on  the basis\n     of all the circumstances of the  litigation\") (citation\n     omitted).\n\n          The  district  court  should   not  only  exercise  its\n\ndiscretion but also do so demonstrably.  It is important\n\n          for  the district court  to provide a concise\n          but clear explanation of  its reasons for the\n          fee award.   When an  adjustment is requested\n          on  the basis  of either  the exceptional  or\n          limited  nature of the relief obtained by the\r                                   \n          plaintiff,  the  district  court should  make\r                                                                 \n          clear that it has considered the relationship\r                                                                 \n          between the amount of the fee awarded and the\r                                                                 \n          results obtained.\r                                    \n\nHensley v.

The district court's explanation of  the\n\nbases for  its conclusions  is essential to  meaningful appellate\n\nreview.  Grendel's  Den, Inc. v. Larkin,  749 F.2d 945,  950 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1984).\n\n          It is not  clear exactly  what the legal  basis is  for\n\nappellants' request  for a  remand.    That is,  it is  not clear\n\nwhether appellants are contending that the district court did not\n\nconduct the analysis required by Hensley in cases of interrelated\r                                                  \n\n                               -85-\r\r\n\nclaims, or,  instead are contending that the  court conducted the\n\nanalysis, but came  to the  wrong conclusion.   We consider,  and\n\nreject, both possibilities.\n\n          Appellants  overstate their case  when they assert that\n\nthe court  \"made no reduction  for counsel  fees as a  result\" of\n\nunsuccessful claims.  The  district court specifically found that\n\non two  dates (February 2 and 5, 1993) research was undertaken on\n\nissues  on which plaintiffs did not prevail, but that \"the issues\n\nare  interwoven\";  the court  stated  that  it was  reducing  the\n\ncharges allowed for those two days by 50%.\n\n          Although  we interpret the  statement that  \"the issues\n\nare interwoven\"  as having been  intended to  invoke the  Hensley\r                                                                           \n\nanalysis, it is, to  be sure, not a sufficient explanation of the\n\nbasis of  the  court's award  of fees  in a  case of  purportedly\n\ninterrelated  claims.   It  falls  short  of  the  \"thorough  and\n\ndetailed opinion reviewing the imbrication between the successful\n\nand  unsuccessful claims\" that  was before the  court in Lipsett,\r                                                                          \n\n975 F.2d at 941.  In the present case, the district court did not\n\n-- as far as we can tell  on the record before us -- \"make  clear\n\nthat it considered the relationship between the amount of the fee\n\nawarded and the  result obtained.\"  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.\r                                                         \n\nThe  court's order  does not  reflect a  Hensley analysis  of the\r                                                          \n\nrelationship among the claims; in fact, it does not indicate what\n\nissues  the court  has  determined to  be  interrelated, or  even\n\nwhether they are issues of fact or law.\n\n          Nevertheless,  our review  of  the record  leads us  to\n\n                               -86-\r\r\n\nconclude   that  Scarfo's   claims  of   sexual  harassment   and\n\nintentional  infliction of  emotional distress  shared sufficient\n\ncommon  issues of fact with her successful claims under Title VII\n\nand the Equal Pay Act to justify the award made in this case.  In\n\nany event, we conclude that appellants should not now be heard on\n\ntheir request  for remand because they did not adequately present\n\nthis issue  to the trial court  or in the briefs  filed with this\n\ncourt.\n\n          The trial court's  order, it is true,  does not address\n\nthe nature of legal work performed by Scarfo's counsel beyond the\n\nresearch billed for February 2 and February 5, 1993.  But we will\n\nnot  ourselves consider,  or  remand to  the  district court  for\n\nconsideration  of,  a blanket  request  not  specific enough  for\n\nreasoned  evaluation of the  merits of  the request.   Appellants\n\nhave failed to meet  their burden of production before  the trial\n\ncourt and their  burden of adequate  briefing before this  court.\n\nThis  failure deprives both courts  of an opportunity  to make an\n\nintelligent and reasoned decision regarding the  segregability of\n\nfees  awarded for  any work  related to  losing claims  that took\n\nplace on days other than February 2 and 5, 1993.\n\n          Parties must fulfill certain obligations of specificity\n\nof grounds of  claim or defense  if the district  court is to  be\n\nable to make a reasoned decision  as to a proper fee award.   The\n\nfee-seeker, for example, must provide  a \"particularized account\"\n\nof his or her claim for fees.  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 527.  When\r                                                   \n\na fee-seeker has not won on all counts but properly documents her\n\n                               -87-\r\r\n\nclaim  for fees  and plausibly  asserts that  the time  cannot be\n\nallocated between successful and  unsuccessful counts, it becomes\n\nthe fee-target's burden to  show a basis for segregability.   See\r                                                                           \n\nLipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.  Appellants failed to meet this burden.\r                 \n\n          There was  evidence before  the district court,  in the\n\nform of testimony by  Scarfo's counsel, that the requested  award\n\nalready  reflected  a $75,000  deduction  from  overall costs  to\n\naccount  for  time spent  solely  on  the  sexual harassment  and\n\ninfliction  of emotional  distress claims;  the remainder  of her\n\nfirm's work  on these claims, she testified,  was closely related\n\nto the claims on which her client  prevailed.  She also testified\n\nthat  the award  did  not include  any  expenses related  to  the\n\ndefamation  claim.    That  testimony  constituted  a  \"plausible\n\nassertion\" that counsel had already segregated fees to the extent\n\npracticable.   The credibility of that testimony is for the trial\n\ncourt, not this court, to determine.\n\n          The defendant  was free to challenge  this assertion by\n\npointing  specifically to  segregable  aspects of  the bill  that\n\nformed  the  basis  for  the  award.    The  defendants'   cross-\n\nexamination of  Scarfo's counsel  regarding  expenses billed  for\n\nFebruary 2 and February  5 apparently convinced the judge  that a\n\n50% reduction in the  fees for those days was  warranted, despite\n\nhis  conclusion  that  they  pertained  to  \"interwoven\"  issues.\n\nPerhaps  a  further  reduction in  fees  would  have  followed if\n\ndefendants had  presented an adequate basis  for subjecting other\n\nbilled  hours to judicial scrutiny.  But defendants did not point\n\n                               -88-\r\r\n\nto any other purportedly segregable entries in the bill submitted\n\nby  Scarfo,   either  during  cross-examination  or   in  written\n\nsubmissions contained in the record before us.\n\n          Appellants did not  even assert in the trial court that\n\nthe award improperly included fees attributable to the defamation\n\nor breach of contract claims.\n\n          Plaintiffs' contentions  at trial and before this court\n\nregarding the segregability of other claims, moreover, are merely\n\nstatements of conclusions.  The  written submissions to the trial\n\ncourt contained in the record before us merely stated conclusions\n\nthat the  losing claims \"have  separate and distinct  elements of\n\nproof requiring different testimony and documentary evidence\"  or\n\nhave   a  \"distinct   and  separate   nature\"  and   are  \"easily\n\nsegregated.\"  Appellants' argument  of segregability on appeal is\n\neven less specific than  the arguments advanced before the  trial\n\ncourt.\n\n            In  these circumstances, in which we do not even know\n\nwhat arguments the  appellants would make on  remand because they\n\nhave failed to make those arguments to the trial court  or to us,\n\nwe  conclude that it would be improper to give appellants another\n\nbite at the apple.\n\n          Appellants  argue  to  us that  plaintiffs  \"failed  to\n\nestablish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly  failed to explain\n\nmany of the general entries which were made.\"  Even if we were to\n\nconstrue  these  assertions  as  arguments  independent   of  the\n\narguments  regarding segregability of fees, they are no more than\n\n                               -89-\r\r\n\nstatements of the conclusion appellants ask us to reach.  They do\n\nnot constitute adequate  explanation of a basis  for reasoning to\n\nthis  conclusion from  evidence  of record.    We cannot  sustain\n\ncontentions \n\nof this kind.  See Brown v.

The plaintiffs Genevieve Scarfo and Brian Miller are former employees of defendant Cabletron Systems, Inc.  (\"Cabletron\").  Craig Benson and Robert Levine, supervisory employees of Cabletron, were also defendants in the district court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo claimed, inter alia, that defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and terminated her employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(f).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Miller claimed, inter alia, under Title VII for retaliatory discharge based on his alleged refusal, as plaintiff Scarfo's immediate supervisor, to discriminate against her by terminating her employment on the basis of her sex.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal claims of error asserted on appeal challenge instructions to the jury.  Each party opposing a claim of error asserts that no timely objection or request was made in the trial court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel representing defendants on appeal first came into the case after completion of the jury trial.  Not surprisingly, they seek to present contentions substantially different from those presented by defense counsel during and before the jury trial.  Whenever new counsel enter and raise new contentions, opposing counsel may find irresistible the temptation to counter with new contentions of their own.  Almost inevitably, then, the entry into a case of new counsel for one party increases litigation burdens for all parties.  An award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party may offset this burden in part.  But unfairness may remain to opposing parties if the trial or appellate court allows new grounds of claim or defense to be asserted.  For this reason, among others, we encounter a threshold question in this case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way of framing the threshold question neutrally, abjuring \"plain error,\" United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564, 569-72 (1st Cir.1995), \"waiver,\" id.  (citing United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)), \"forfeiture,\" id., \"invited error,\" id., \"abandon[ment],\" United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1235 (1st Cir.1995), and other terminology freighted with connotations, is to ask:  Should we hold that the appellant (or cross-appellant) on each claim of error now before us is not entitled to be heard on the merits of that contention in the circumstances of this appeal?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Searching for the answer requires that we consider procedures for deciding mixed law-fact issues that involve unsettled law, genuine disputes of fact, and the exercise of discretion by jury, or judge, or both.  The search requires also that we take account of Supreme Court and circuit decisions handed down after this case was argued, including O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995);  Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995);  United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223 (1st Cir.1995);  and United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In describing the tasks of trial and appellate courts in circumstances of this degree of complexity, commentators and opinion writers have invoked imagery of the almost impenetrable.  They have spoken, for example, of the \"esoteric,\" Marder, 48 F.3d at 570, \"The Bramble Bush,\" Karl N. Llewellyn, The Bramble Bush (1930), or--in a more venerable and ominous allusion--a \"Serbonian Bog,\" Landress v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 291 U.S. 491, 499, 54 S.Ct. 461, 463, 78 L.Ed. 934 (1934) (Cardozo, J., dissenting) (\"The attempted distinction between accidental results and accidental means will plunge this branch of the law into a Serbonian Bog.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imagery, even if hyperbole in the classic sense of a figure of speech rather than an assertion to be taken literally, may nevertheless aptly call attention to the increasing intricacy of a rapidly evolving jurisprudence of procedural preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that we need enter only a little way into this maze of precedents, and on a well-marked path, to decide the case now before us.  This is so because rules and precedents have erected a gate at the point of entry upon each potentially promising path through the maze, and each gate is closed to appellants whose contentions have the particular characteristics of those before us in this appeal.  Thus, we affirm in substance, though with minor exceptions, and with some modification of amounts of awards, and on condition that a judgment amended as to form be entered in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first explain the terms of the judgment that was ordered in the district court and the nature of the claims of error.  Then we explain why, in the interests of justice, we hold that each claim of error asserted in this appeal is either harmless error or is raised too late for review under the harmless error standard and cannot be sustained under the more rigorous requirement that relief is to be granted only to avoid a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first error we address is one not raised by the parties.  We consider it because it might be thought to have jurisdictional implications.  The \"final judgment\" entered in this case was, in its form, not literally in compliance with the requirement that \"[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made not one but a series of orders.  In most instances, the order is not self-explanatory.  Instead, it refers to an opinion or memorandum of the court to which one must go to understand precisely the meaning of the order.  In these circumstances, if, for example, a party seeks enforcement of the judgment--perhaps even after the case is closed and the file is sent to storage--the parties and any other person required to act will have great difficulty finding out what exactly were the terms of the \"final judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of our jurisdiction, however, we conclude that the district court ordered the functional equivalent of a \"final judgment\" in a sequence of orders that includes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the \"Judgment\" of May 10, 1994 (incorporating, first, the Order of June 2, 1993 granting in part and denying in part defendants' Motion to Dismiss;  second, the Endorsed Order of November 17, 1993 concerning the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment;  third, the Special Verdicts of May 4, 1994;  fourth, the Order of May 9, 1994, concerning the Court's Calculation of Title VII Damages);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 19, 1994 on Miller's Motion for Prejudgment Interest;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 19, 1994 on Miller's Motion for Attorneys' Fees;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 19, 1994 on Scarfo's Motion for Attorneys' Fees;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 20, 1994 on Scarfo's Motion for Prejudgment and Postjudgment Interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were we to remand for entry of a \"final judgment\" that is formally in full compliance with Rule 58, before deciding the appeal that has now been briefed and argued, the case would in due course be back before us again with precisely the same issues to be decided as those we perceive from the record now before us.  To avoid the delay and waste of resources incident to such a remand, we proceed to consider the issues now and will direct entry of an appropriate amended judgment on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From close examination of the several orders and memoranda identified above, we conclude that a final judgment of the substance gleaned from all these orders would have recited provisions in substance as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) judgment for plaintiff Scarfo on her claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for sex discrimination against defendants Cabletron and Benson for the sum of $1,187,901.07 (consisting of the sum of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock, reduced by the jury's award of $28,000 under the Equal Pay Act, paragraph (d) below, in order to prevent duplicate recovery) without prejudgment interest;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) judgment for defendant Levine on Scarfo's Title VII claim for sex discrimination against him;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) judgment for defendants Cabletron, Benson, and Levine on plaintiff Scarfo's claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for sexual harassment based on a hostile or abusive environment;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) judgment for plaintiff Scarfo against Cabletron (but not against Benson or Levine), on her claim under the Equal Pay Act, in the sum of $28,000 without prejudgment interest;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) judgment for defendants Benson and Levine on plaintiff Scarfo's claim for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(f) plaintiff Scarfo's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendant Cabletron is dismissed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(g) plaintiff Scarfo's claims for breach of contract and defamation are dismissed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(h) judgment for plaintiff Miller against defendants Cabletron and Benson, on his claim for retaliatory discharge in violation of Title VII, in the sum of $1,391,711.85 (consisting of $190,651.85 in back pay, $995,000 in front pay, and $206,060 for the value of stock options) without prejudgment interest;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) judgment for plaintiff Miller against defendant Cabletron (but not against Benson) on his claim under New Hampshire state law for wrongful termination, in the sum of $995,000 with prejudgment interest at a per annum rate of ten percent under New Hampshire state law from the date of filing, April 14, 1992, to the date of the verdict, May 4, 1994;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(j) plaintiff Miller's claims of abuse of process and intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress against Benson, Levine, and Cabletron are dismissed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(k) all claims by plaintiff Miller against defendant Levine are dismissed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(l ) it is further ordered that plaintiff Miller will not be allowed to collect more than the larger of the two awards in his favor against Cabletron as set forth in paragraphs (h) and (i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substance of paragraph (l ) is not explicitly stated in any of the orders identified above.  Implicit in those orders and the basis on which they are explained in the memoranda referred to, however, is an assumption that the awards to plaintiff Miller overlap.  Because duplicative collection would be impermissible, we conclude it is appropriate to interpret the trial court's orders as providing that Miller not be allowed to collect more than the larger (i.e., the Title VII award) of the two awards against Cabletron.

Thus, two more paragraphs, as stated below, may be added to reflect the entire substance of a final judgment that includes awards of attorneys' fees.

The recent decision in O'Neal v.

A party who does not timely object in accordance with Rule 51, however, does not have the benefit of review under Rule 61, either before the trial court (on a post-trial motion) or on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If review is allowed at all at the instance of a party who did not comply with Rule 51, it is under a standard requiring substantially more than that the party show that the error was harmful (the Rule 61 standard).  It has long been settled that, in general, an objection or request for jury instruction not made in compliance with Civil Rule 51 cannot be raised successfully on appeal.  Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F.P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297 F.2d 497, 500 (1st Cir.1962).  The rule has been rigorously enforced in this circuit, and its clear language will be overlooked \"only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice,\" Elgabri v. Lekas, 964 F.2d 1255, 1259 and n. 1 (1st Cir.1992), or \"where the error 'seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,' \" Lash v. Cutts, 943 F.2d 147, 152 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Smith v. Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 877 F.2d 1106, 1110 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 965, 110 S.Ct. 406, 107 L.Ed.2d 372 (1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rigorously enforced timeliness principle is fundamental both to fair process and to avoiding adverse effect on substantial rights of the parties.  Under such a principle, a clearly defined opportunity to present a contention must be exercised at a precisely defined time in the trial proceedings.  It is a now-or-never opportunity that a party must, at that precise time, use or lose.  Cf. Arenson v. Southern Univ.  Law Ctr., 43 F.3d 194, 198 (5th Cir.1995) (invoking the phrase \"use it or lose it\" in relation to timeliness of motions for judgment as a matter of law and, alternatively, for a conditional new trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these contexts is the preparation of the charge to the jury, including the specific phrasing of any questions submitted to the jury.  The moment immediately before the jury retires to deliberate is a time when hard choices, with significant consequences, must be made by the parties and by the trial judge.  Interests of fairness to each party weigh heavily in favor of requiring that every other party, at this critical moment, use or lose any right to assert that the trial court should change in some way the court's instructions to the jury on the substantive law governing the case.  It is awkward to change instructions after the jury has commenced deliberating, and as a practical matter, once the jury has been disbanded after returning a verdict, it can never be called back to receive the corrected charge that the trial court might have given if asked at the right time to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to exercise the right to object to the court's charge at the critical moment prescribed by Rule 51 results in the loss of an opportunity for review under a standard no more burdensome for the appellant than the harmless error standard.  Unless the reviewing court concludes that the charge has caused a miscarriage of justice or has undermined the integrity of the judicial process, the charge is treated as having an effect closely analogous to law-of-the-case doctrine, and for similar reasons of policy and fairness of process.  Moore, 47 F.3d at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use-or-lose principle applies with special force to mixed law-fact issues.  Cf. Cheshire Medical Ctr. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., 49 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir.1995) (citing Chellman v. Saab-Scania AB, 138 N.H. 73, 637 A.2d 148, 151 (1993)) (\"Clear and intelligible jury instructions are particularly important to explain complex or confusing legal concepts.\").  If the trial counsel and the trial court are able to fashion interrogatories that disentangle law from fact and ask the jury all of the purely fact questions that are essential to determining the outcome of the case once the disputed issues of law are finally resolved, the rights of the parties to jury trial can be protected even though a final decision on critical legal issues is deferred to a later time.  If, however (either because of a preference for doing so or because of a sense that there is no other practical option) the trial court elects to submit one or more mixed law-fact questions to the jury, full protection of the rights of the parties to have their dispute resolved by the jury to whom the case is first submitted weighs compellingly in favor of the conclusion that applying the use-or-lose principle is essential to fair process and a just disposition of the controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that no party in this case is entitled to have any of the alleged errors it presents in this appeal considered under the harmless error standard of Rule 61.  The reason is that each appellant and cross-appellant now complaining of some aspect of the charge to the jury had the right and opportunity to state its contention to the trial judge after completion of the judge's charge (including the trial judge's modification of the charge after hearing objections)--and did not use it.  Having failed to make a timely objection, the complaining party is entitled to relief only to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice or otherwise to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.  In most instances, nevertheless, we have determined in our review of the record before us that we are not in \"grave doubt,\" as defined in O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, and conclude instead that correction of jury instructions at the appropriate time would not have affected the verdict in this case.  In each of those instances, since we have determined that the alleged error was harmless, it follows a fortiori that no miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before explaining the relevant characteristics of the record before us that lead to our conclusion, we pause to explain why two kinds of precedents do not apply to the kinds of claims of error before us here.  First, an additional standard of appellate review was invoked to allow new contentions to be considered on the merits, in \"special circumstances,\" in Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc. 453 U.S. 247, 256, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 2754, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981).  That case, however, is easily distinguished from the present appeal;  it involved equitable relief and did not involve alleged infringements of the rights of parties, in a case tried before a jury, to have disputed fact questions finally decided by the jury empaneled to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second kind of inapplicable precedent is a development under the rubric of \"waiver.\"   In criminal cases, precedents have added a distinctive element to procedural-preclusion analysis by recognizing that in some instances, even when the court is satisfied that \"plain error\" was committed, still the appealing party may be barred by circumstances that constitute \"waiver.\"   In Olano the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>Waiver is different from forfeiture.  Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\"  ...  Whether a particular right is waivable;  whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver;  whether certain procedures are required for waiver;  and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake....  Mere forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, does not extinguish an \"error\" under Rule 52(b)....   If a legal rule was violated during the District Court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an \"error\" within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marder, 48 F.3d at 570 (quoting Olano, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1777).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recently a panel of this circuit has observed that there have been \"conflicting signals\" on the scope and nature of a waiver.  See Marder, 48 F.3d at 570 (comparing United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959, 971 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Espinal, 757 F.2d 423, 426 (1st Cir.1985);  United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 30 (1st Cir.1984);  and United States v. Kakley, 741 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 887, 105 S.Ct. 261, 83 L.Ed.2d 197 (1984)).  Because in this case we have concluded that we are satisfied that correction of the errors called to our attention would not have affected the verdict, in any event, we need not consider whether \"waiver\" in the Olano sense may be extended to the civil context (and might then be an additional reason for concluding that appellants (and cross-appellants) cannot prevail on this appeal).  \"Forfeiture\" in the Olano sense is a concept quite similar to principles underlying enforcement of timeliness requirements.  We next turn to applying those principles to the claims of error asserted in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>IV. ERROR IN INSTRUCTIONS ON SCARFO'S SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted in Part II.A above, the instruction on Scarfo's sex discrimination claim was flawed in its treatment of the issue of causation because it understated plaintiff's burden of proof.  Is the effect of the error so egregious as to warrant reversal even though defendants did not object at the time and in the manner prescribed by Civil Rule 51?   Because we conclude that the jury would have reached the same verdict even had it been properly instructed, the error was harmless.  Thus, it readily follows that no miscarriage of justice or other blight on the judicial process has resulted from the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of discrimination is powerful.  It contains numerous examples of Cabletron's different treatment of Scarfo and her male colleagues who were similarly situated.  On the other hand, it is also true that some evidence in the record tends to support defendants' theory that Scarfo was fired for legitimate business reasons.  In these circumstances, we must explain the evidence of record in somewhat greater detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a jury is not required to credit a plaintiff's evidence, even if the evidence is uncontradicted, and neither are we.  But a realistic assessment of the likelihood of a different verdict in this case, had different instructions been given, depends in part on an examination of the strength of Scarfo's evidence and the findings it would support.  We summarize that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strongest evidence on record supporting defendants' theory was the review of Scarfo by Brian Miller, Scarfo's immediate supervisor at Cabletron.  Miller's report contained several positive comments.  But negative remarks regarding Scarfo's management and purchasing skills dominated his review.  Miller also reported internal discipline problems in the purchasing department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on record supporting plaintiff Scarfo's theory, however, is overwhelming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Scarfo's requests to improve her department were overlooked while the same requests made by her male replacement were granted.  After Scarfo was hired as a buyer and then promoted to purchasing supervisor, she was told that she would not be eligible for a raise until July 1988.  Scarfo continued to receive a buyer's salary, though she performed all the functions of a supervisor.  But in this position she was repeatedly denied requests to hire additional buyers, train staff, and update equipment so that she could focus on her managerial duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Scarfo was terminated, Justin O'Connor, a purchasing manager, was allowed to hire additional buyers, upgrade equipment, implement training programs, and make other improvements that Scarfo had previously been refused permission to make.  Further, unlike Scarfo, O'Connor was permitted to limit his buying responsibilities so that he could devote more time to his managerial responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, when the purchasing department moved to a larger space, Scarfo was denied an office although her male colleague was given a separate office.  Craig Benson, the chief operating officer at Cabletron, did not want Scarfo to have her own office.  Benson, however, knew that Tim Jacobs, who was hired with Scarfo, would have a separate office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Scarfo's business trip expenses were carefully examined.  In contrast, the expenses of a male colleague who was on the same trip were not questioned.  Specifically, Benson examined Scarfo's expense vouchers for a two-week business trip.  He did not review expense vouchers of Roger Lawrence, a male employee who went on the same trip and whose expenses were nearly identical to those of Scarfo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Benson singled out Scarfo to take the blame for an over-purchase of circuit boards, although other employees were involved with this transaction.  Scarfo had ordered the boards, but the boards were subsequently not needed.  Although Benson knew that others besides Scarfo were responsible for this over-purchase, he told Miller, \"I don't like being ripped off, and I blame Jeanne Scarfo for this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, Scarfo was treated differently with respect to stock options.  Despite Benson's explanation that Scarfo was omitted from the stock option list and his promise that she would be on the next list of stock recipients, Scarfo, unlike her male counterparts, never received any stock options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth, in addition to the evidence of these poignant examples of disparate treatment, correlated with gender, there is in the record other strong evidence of discrimination.  Scarfo offered evidence that in April 1990, Benson told Miller to hire a \"guy\" for her position, but Miller refused.  Benson said, \"I don't care if you fire or demote her, but I want a guy in that position.\"   Approximately ten days later, Miller was fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Miller's departure, Scarfo was demoted to buyer but was asked to continue to perform all management functions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1990, when Justin O'Connor was hired as purchasing manager, Benson told him that he did not like Scarfo and urged O'Connor to fire her.  Only ten days after he came onto the job, O'Connor wrote a negative review of Scarfo and placed her on probation through February 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Connor terminated Scarfo on January 10, 1991, a month before the probationary period expired.  His reason for firing Scarfo was her failure to show improvement.  In the circumstances, it would have been difficult for O'Connor to make a reasonable determination as to whether Scarfo's performance had improved because Scarfo's time records indicated that she was legitimately absent during her probation period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into account the weight of this evidence of discrimination, we conclude that the error in the jury instructions on Scarfo's Title VII claim was not an error that \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\" Lash, 943 F.2d at 152, or caused a miscarriage of justice, Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1259.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude also that no other basis exists in the circumstances of this case to warrant an exception from applying the use-or-lose proposition stated in Rule 51 and explained, in Part III of this Opinion, as a principle aimed at achieving outcomes of jury trial that are fair and just on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. SCARFO'S EQUAL PAY ACT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By instructing the jury that plaintiff merely had to show disparity of treatment between the sexes and not sex-based discrimination, and by failing to instruct on statutory defenses included in the EPA, the trial court erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The EPA reads in relevant part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>No employer ... shall discriminate ... between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees ... at a rate less than the rate at which [the employer] pays wages to employees of the opposite sex ... for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system;  (ii) a merit system;  (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production;  or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 206(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of record overwhelmingly supports a finding for plaintiff (even under a legal standard of intended sex-based discrimination, had the instruction so required).  Defendants had the right and opportunity to object to the trial court's instruction and tell the trial judge how to correct the error.  As defendants did not use the right, we review the record before us only for evidence of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the evidence summarized in Part IV, above, we note additional support in the record for the jury's finding on the EPA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scarfo's economic expert testified that he reviewed and processed Cabletron data on pay increments, education, and employment history.  His analysis showed a $14,000 difference between male and female pay for Cabletron managers and supervisors.  The program accounted for education and seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the evidence in the record before the jury, and before us, includes data from personnel files for men and women holding similar positions.  For example, at the same time Cabletron hired Scarfo, it hired Tim Jacobs.  Unlike Scarfo, who was paid a starting salary of $27,000, Jacobs was given the title of supervisor and paid a starting salary of $35,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in 1990, Cabletron hired Justin O'Connor as purchasing manager at a salary of $65,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to justify this pay discrepancy, defendants call attention to evidence that O'Connor had more education and vastly greater experience than Scarfo.  Given the strength of the evidence supporting the EPA claim, however, it is very unlikely that the jury would have returned a different verdict had the error in the instruction been corrected before they deliberated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>VI. SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p>A. The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scarfo presents on appeal a contention that she frames as a single alleged error in the charge to the jury on her hostile environment claim.  In our view, however, the contention raises two issues that, though interwoven and related, involve distinct points, neither of which was clearly expressed in the objection before the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Scarfo argues that the court erred in instructing the jury that Scarfo had to prove \"unreasonable interference with her work performance\" as an element of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Scarfo argues, at least implicitly, that the court should have instructed that in order to show such interference, the plaintiff did not need to prove that her tangible productivity had declined, but only that the harassment so altered her working conditions as to make it more difficult for her to do the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the objection, quoted from the transcript in Part II.C above, lacked the specificity and distinctness required by Rule 51 to preserve for appeal any issue regarding the instructions to the jury on the hostile environment claim.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the language of the objection is less explicit than a well-crafted objection should be.  Although the objection was sufficient to inform the trial court that Scarfo contended she was entitled to a \"factors\" instruction as part of the Title VII charge, it failed to proffer a correct instruction or in any other way to explain how the alleged error in the charge could be corrected.  Also, the objection failed to identify explicitly the second of the two issues stated above, and to explain how the alleged error could be corrected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo's objection thus fell short of the clarity and precision required to alert the trial judge to the contentions now advanced on appeal.  It matters not whether Scarfo had by that time formulated the contentions as they are now argued (rather than developing them through further reflection during later proceedings, either in the trial court after verdict, or on appeal).  In any event, the trial court was not alerted to the contentions now advanced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss the two related but separable issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p>B. \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo says that the court erred in its instruction to the jury that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence an abusive work environment that \"unreasonably interfered with her work performance.\"   Plaintiff argues, citing Harris, that \"unreasonable interference\" was not a separate element of the claim (failure to prove which would be fatal to the claim), but only a factor to be considered along with all other relevant factors in determining whether an abusive work environment had been proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Scarfo's favor, we accept the point that the terms \"element\" and \"factor\", as they appear in judicial opinions and commentaries, often signify a key difference between two types of legal tests prescribed by law, for use by decisionmakers (juries or judges), in determining whether the evidence in a particular case satisfies the requirements for a legal theory (of a claim or defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One type of legal test prescribes two or more \"elements\" of a claim or defense.  Each \"element\" must be satisfied.  Failure to satisfy any one among two or more \"elements\" is fatal to the claim or defense for which the legal test was prescribed by law, even if all other elements are proved beyond doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other type of legal test prescribes that two or more \"factors\" are to be weighed and evaluated in making a single \"evaluative\" determination that takes account of all of the evidence bearing on all of the \"factors.\"   Weakness of the showing of one factor, or even total failure to show it, is not fatal;  a strong showing as to other factors may outweigh the deficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the law may have been previously, Harris v. Forklift Sys., --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), leaves no doubt that the legal test prescribed by Title VII, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, is, in part at least, a factors-type test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p>Whether an environment is \"hostile\" or \"abusive\" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances, which may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct;  its severity;  whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance;  and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance....  [W]hile psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 371.   Thus, that discriminatory conduct unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's work performance is not an element, proof of which is essential, but a factor to be considered in determining whether an \"abusive\" or \"hostile\" environment has been proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal test set forth in Harris is in fact neither entirely an \"elements\" test nor entirely a \"factors\" test.  Instead, the Harris test has both elements and factors within it.  First, it is comprised of several \"elements\"--each alone fatal to the claim if not satisfied.  One of these \"elements\" is that the work environment was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the test (or \"sub-test,\" one may prefer to say, to distinguish between the overall test and the internal test for one \"element\") for determining whether one of the \"elements\" has been satisfied is a \"factors\" type of test.  More specifically, one of the elements of the Harris test is proof that the environment in which the plaintiff worked was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"   And the test (or sub-test) for determining whether this \"element\" has been satisfied in a particular case is a \"factors\" test.  The passage from Harris, quoted immediately above, identifies both of these two characteristics of the legal test set forth by the Court in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reading of the Opinion for a unanimous Court is reinforced by the Concurring Opinions of both Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg.  Justice Scalia noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p>\"[o]ne of the factors mentioned in the Court's nonexhaustive list--whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance--would, if it were made an absolute test, provide greater guidance to juries and employers.  But I see no basis for such a limitation in the language of the statute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 372 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Justice Ginsburg, using the word \"dominantly\" rather than an absolute or conclusive term, also recognized that \"unreasonable interference with work performance\" was not alone decisive as to whether an abusive environment exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p>[T]he adjudicator's inquiry should center, dominantly, on whether the discriminatory conduct has unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff's work performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 372 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the trial court's instruction was incorrect in stating that \"unreasonable[e] interfere[nce] with her work performance\" was an absolute requirement for showing the existence of a hostile or abusive work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem is that plaintiff Scarfo did not properly preserve this issue for appeal because plaintiff Scarfo's statement to the trial court of the grounds of her objection was deficient in several ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it was susceptible of being interpreted as saying that the Harris test is entirely a \"factors\" test.  It did not acknowledge that the Harris test is in some respects an \"elements\" test, one element being that the work environment was hostile or abusive.  Thus, the trial judge was not alerted to why his use of the language of an \"elements\" test in the charge might be error because of the particular way he used it, even though language such as his would be proper and even essential as part of an entirely correct instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the objection did not correctly formulate the Harris \"element\" over which there was dispute and satisfaction of which must be determined by a \"factors\" test (or sub-test).  Thus, even if the trial judge understood plaintiff's contention that some aspect, at least, of the overall Harris test was a \"factors\" test (or sub-test) for deciding whether one \"element\" was satisfied, still the objection did not formulate that element clearly enough to tell the trial judge how to correct the alleged error in his instruction.  That \"element,\" as now clearly formulated on appeal, is not \"unreasonable interference with work performance.\"   It is, instead, that the work environment was hostile or abusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, objections to a trial judge's charge to the jury must be clear enough and explicit enough to tell the trial judge what the party wishes the trial judge to say in order to correct the alleged error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Linn v. Andover Newton Theological Sch., Inc., 874 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1989) (\"If there is a problem with the instructions, the judge must be told precisely what the problem is, and as importantly, what the attorney would consider a satisfactory cure.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that plaintiff Scarfo's objection was not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal in accordance with Rule 51.  Since the plaintiff failed to make a timely objection, we will reverse or award a new trial only if we determine, based on our review of the record, that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice or \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  Lash v. Cutts, 943 F.2d at 152.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the court's explanation of what constitutes a \"hostile or abusive environment\" did not precisely conform with Harris.  Harris, however, does not prescribe a particular instruction on what constitutes a hostile or abusive work environment.  Rather, it clearly implies that its list of factors is nonexhaustive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Harris, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 371 (\"Whether an environment is 'hostile' or 'abusive' can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances, which may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity....\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no basis for concluding now--if, indeed, Scarfo is asking us to do so--that the jury interpreted the court's instruction to mean that \"unreasonable interference\" was the only factor they were allowed to consider in determining the existence of a hostile or abusive environment.  Also, we have no basis for determining that the jury, in deciding whether the work environment was hostile or abusive, did not consider, as part of their understanding of the instruction, factors such as \"the frequency of the discriminatory conduct;  its severity;  [and] whether it is physically threatening.\"  Id.  We conclude that it is very unlikely that the jury, if it had been instructed correctly, would have returned a different verdict.

She argues that the court's instruction was erroneous because it required the jury to find that the plaintiff's work performance was inadequate and that harassing discriminatory conduct was a cause of that inadequacy.  Plaintiff asserts on appeal that she never intended to prove that the quality or quantity of her work performance declined as a result of her treatment;  the plaintiff's theory of her case was that she continued to perform well despite the sexual harassment.  Thus, she contends that the court's instruction precluded the jury from considering her theory that the discriminatory conduct adversely affected her work conditions, but not the quality of her performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Was Scarfo's objection to the trial court sufficient to alert the court to the refinement of her theory of the case that she now argues before us?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant portion of her objection stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p>And we had requested in our Jury Instruction 22 a paragraph that was not given but that comes from the recent Harris case that says that you don't have to have the unreasonable interference with the work performance.

Plaintiff's proposed Jury Instruction 22 does include a paragraph from the Opinion for the unanimous Court in Harris, but that paragraph does not speak to this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge could not be expected to glean the substance of the present argument from plaintiff's counsel's statements and requests.  Thus, the plaintiff failed to object specifically on this ground as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo correctly notes that Justice Ginsburg made a statement in her concurrence in Harris that supports the argument plaintiff now makes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p>To show such interference, \"the plaintiff need not prove that his or her tangible productivity has declined as a result of the harassment.\"   It suffices to prove that a reasonable person subject to the discriminatory conduct would find, as the plaintiff did, that the harassment so altered working conditions as to \"make it more difficult to do the job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harris v. Forklift, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 372 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (quoting Davis v. Monsanto Chem.  Co., 858 F.2d 345, 349 (6th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1110, 109 S.Ct. 3166, 104 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1989) (a case concerning race-based discrimination)).  But it is also relevant that Justice Ginsburg's explanation of the meaning of \"unreasonable interference\" was neither expressly adopted nor disavowed by the Opinion for the unanimous Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated below, we have no need to decide, and refrain from deciding, whether, had a more explicit objection been made, the trial court should have adopted Justice Ginsburg's interpretation of \"unreasonable interference with work performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that the quoted passage from Justice Ginsburg's concurrence is also the view of the Court, we conclude that plaintiff Scarfo has not met her burden of showing that an exception to the use-or-lose principle should be invoked here.  The trial court's instruction on plaintiff's sexual harassment claim did not elaborate on the phrase \"unreasonable interference with work performance.\"   That instruction did not preclude the jury from considering the theory of her case that plaintiff Scarfo now emphasizes--the theory that her working conditions had been unreasonably altered even though her performance was not affected.  Justice Ginsburg's concurrence treats the phrase \"interference with the plaintiff's work performance\" as including an alteration of the working conditions that makes it harder to do the job.  Nothing in any of the opinions in Harris suggests, as plaintiff now does on appeal, that this phrase can be interpreted to mean only a tangible decline in productivity.  In addition, the plaintiff has not shown any basis for our concluding that the particular instruction at issue in this case, either as a whole or in part, gave the jury the impression that a tangible decline in productivity was something the plaintiff was required to prove as an element of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed another way, plaintiff's argument on appeal is that the trial court should have given an instruction stating that the plaintiff can prove unreasonable interference with work performance either (1) by proving that the discriminatory conduct would cause the quality or quantity of a reasonable person's work to decline and the plaintiff's work did so decline;  or (2) by proving that a reasonable person, subjected to the harassment that she proved, would find, and the plaintiff did so find, that the harassment so altered working conditions as to make it more difficult to do the job.  If Scarfo thought that such an instruction would have been helpful to the jury's understanding of her claim, Scarfo had the right and opportunity to make such a request.  No such request was made at the critical moment prescribed by Rule 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p>D.

She could have preserved the issue by moving for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50, or by moving for a new trial under Rule 59.  See Wells Real Estate v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 810 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S.Ct. 392, 102 L.Ed.2d 381 (1988) (waiver of the right to request judgment as a matter of law does not preclude a party from moving for a new trial).  Her failure to do either is fatal to her appeal on grounds of sufficiency or weight of the evidence, as was made clear in Wells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence ... because plaintiff's counsel failed to move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in the district court.

Eaton Corp., 809 F.2d 156, 161 (1st Cir.1987), that a post-trial motion is not always required to preserve an issue for appeal.  She maintains that we should review her appeal because it is based solely on a contention of law.  The only strictly legal question raised by her appeal on the harassment claim, however, is the propriety of the jury instruction.  We have addressed that matter in Part VI.B and VI.C, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her alternative argument that the evidence compelled a verdict in her favor--although a contention \"of law\"--is plainly based on assertions about the \"sufficiency\" of the evidence.  This kind of contention is controlled by Wells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that a substantial policy reason mitigates against a conclusion that she has failed to preserve her contention for appeal.  She maintains that if this court requires every party to file a motion for new trial as a prerequisite to appeal, then even parties who prevail on all of their claims except one--and decide against appealing the minor loss--must move for a new trial in anticipation of filing a cross-appeal if the other party should appeal.  Such post-trial procedure, appellant urges us to conclude, would unnecessarily clog the docket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant first raised this policy argument in her reply brief, affording appellees no opportunity to respond.  In any event, it is unconvincing.  At least where, as here, no satisfactory explanation has been advanced for appellant's failure to seek a new trial, we conclude that it is appropriate for us to take account of the fact that trial counsel had the opportunity to decide, and may in fact have decided, that the potential costs of a new trial outweighed the potential benefits.  She could have eased to some extent the burdens of such a decision at the post-trial stage, by moving for new trial only as an alternative to a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  In any event, it would plainly be inconsistent with the letter and spirit of Rule 59 to give her a second opportunity to seek a new trial now when she did not use the opportunity available to her at the time prescribed by Rule 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also considered whether the recent decision in Lebron v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995), might salvage Scarfo's right to complain of this error at this time.  We conclude that it does not, for reasons that apply also to another claim of error (one advanced by defendant Benson), as explained in Part IX, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller argues that the court erred in refusing to instruct on nonpecuniary damages.  Cabletron responds that in fact the court did instruct on this subject.  The record reveals good reason for confusion over this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a colloquy with counsel before the closing arguments, the court stated its intention to instruct the jury on \"enhanced compensatory damages,\" and not to instruct the jury on \"nonpecuniary damages.\"   Miller's counsel objected at this point to the omission of an instruction on nonpecuniary damages, and the court expressly restated its intention not to instruct on nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's counsel, in reliance on the court's ruling, argued in his closing that the jury should award enhanced compensatory damages.  Miller's counsel did not argue to the jury that it should award nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court instructed the jury just after the closing arguments, it instructed on nonpecuniary damages, but did not instruct the jury on enhanced compensatory damages.  This was the opposite of the court's previously stated intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court's instruction in this way, Miller's counsel objected--ostensibly, to apprise the court of the fact that the court's instructions had varied from its stated intention.  Miller's counsel requested that \"the Court reverse those two consistent with what you described this morning.\"   This statement can reasonably be interpreted as a request for an instruction on enhanced compensatory damages to replace the instruction on nonpecuniary damages.  Thus, Miller's counsel's statement arguably indicated to the judge that Miller had changed his position since his original request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this colloquy, the court re-instructed the jury on the wrongful discharge claim.  This time, the court instructed the jury on enhanced compensatory damages, but did not withdraw its earlier instruction on nonpecuniary damages, or in any other way mention nonpecuniary damages.  No further objection was made by Miller's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear from the record whether the second instruction was intended to substitute for the first instruction, or was intended as an additional instruction.  The latter interpretation is supported by the form of the verdict, in which the jury was instructed to answer special questions, including the damages questions referred to below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded Miller $995,000 in damages on the wrongful discharge claim, but awarded no \"enhanced compensatory damages.\"   See Jury Verdict, Questions 4 and 5.  Although no question on the verdict form specifically addressed \"nonpecuniary damages,\" Question 4, which refers to damages generally, may reasonably have been construed by the jury to include both pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, the instructions and the verdict form did not preclude the jury from considering an award of nonpecuniary damages in accordance with the original instruction, and the jury's award of $995,000 may have included such an award.  Thus, the verdict form together with the instructions does not conclusively demonstrate that, as plaintiff Miller urges, the jury was not instructed on the issue of nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to conclude that the jury was not instructed on nonpecuniary damages, counsel's failure to object, after the \"substitute\" instruction was given, is an obstacle in the way of Miller's asserting error with respect to this instruction on appeal.  Moreover, Miller's counsel's apparent reversal of his position--although arguably intended merely to apprise the court of its inconsistency--weighs against allowing Miller to assert his original position on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these obstacles is another.  Although plaintiff argues that the availability of nonpecuniary damages in a wrongful discharge action is an open question, defendant Cabletron argues that nonpecuniary damages are not available under New Hampshire state law in a wrongful termination case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., 114 N.H. 130, 316 A.2d 549 (1974) (noting that nonpecuniary damages are not available in contract actions, and holding in the context of a wrongful termination claim based on breach of contract that the plaintiff had not proved such damages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the most that can be said for Miller is that this issue is an open question under New Hampshire state law, it is not certain that the trial court's charge, in whatever way it is construed, was contrary to New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, we conclude that the controversy over this potentially disputable issue of state law has not been properly preserved for decision on this appeal.  The error, if any, did not result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p>VIII. CABLETRON'S AND BENSON'S APPEAL OF MILLER'S WRONGFUL</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCHARGE CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Cabletron and Benson ask this court to vacate that part of the district court's judgment making an award to plaintiff Miller on his claim under state common law for wrongful termination.  Appellants argue that we should do so either on the ground that New Hampshire would not permit a common law claim for wrongful discharge or on the ground that the district court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also ask that we set aside the damages award and remand the case for a new trial with appropriate guidance to the district court on the scope of damages.  This is in effect a reiteration of the argument that the jury should have been instructed under New Hampshire statutory law rather than common law because, as appellants concede, the principal difference between the two--at least in the context of this case--is in the scope of the remedies available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, appellants ask that this court certify the determinative question of state common law to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that this claim should never have been submitted to the jury because New Hampshire's human rights laws, see N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 354-A, provides the exclusive remedy for a claim of retaliatory discharge based on sex discrimination.  Appellee Miller responds that appellants did not properly preserve the issue for appeal and that, in any event, the cited statute does not provide an exclusive remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants acknowledge that they never objected to the court's instruction to the jury on the question of damages.  The first time appellants gave the trial judge notice of the argument now advanced on appeal was in a post-judgment motion seeking various forms of relief, including vacatur of judgment and a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that they raised the issue of statutory exclusion of common law remedies for gender discrimination in a motion for summary judgment.  Appellants, however, did not \"squarely and distinctly,\" see Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir.1988), raise on the merits in their motion for summary judgment the issue of the exclusion by statute of a common law wrongful termination remedy for gender discrimination.  Moreover, even if we were to hold that they had done so, still, in seeking relief from this court they face the obstacle that they failed to move on this ground, under Rule 50, for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.  In view of this failure to bring the matter to the attention of the trial court after the close of the evidence at trial, their claim of error on this ground is not available for review under a standard as favorable to appellants as the harmless error standard.  See Eastern Mount.  Platform Tennis v. Sherwin Williams, 40 F.3d 492, 497 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the damages award for Miller's state law claim was based on a legal premise that may not be the way this New Hampshire substantive-law issue is eventually resolved, at some future time, it does not follow that the judgment based upon that legal premise was a miscarriage of justice.  The only prejudice that appellants purport to show was an award of damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish that, they argue, is precluded by the absence of nonpecuniary damages from the statutory specification of exclusive remedies.  Even were we to accept this assertion, and hence conclude that plaintiffs were not legally entitled to damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish, the point remains that the record contains evidence of other elements of damages--evidence more compelling than any evidence of pain, suffering, and anguish.  Nor is there any showing that pain, suffering, and anguish were emphasized by Miller in presenting his claims to the jury.  Finally, there is some doubt, as explained above, see Part VII, whether the jury could be expected to understand the charge as instructing that they could award damages for pain and suffering.  At best, the suggestion of prejudice is quite speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we do not consider on the merits appellants' argument for vacating that part of the judgment making an award to Miller on his claim for wrongful termination under state common law.  Nor do we give further consideration to certifying a question to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire when appellants are procedurally barred from raising on the merits the very issue on which they seek certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not consider whether we should vacate this part of the judgment on the ground that the district court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.  Appellants did not brief this issue on appeal, see Brown v. Trustees of Boston University, 891 F.2d 337, 352 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 937, 110 S.Ct. 3217, 110 L.Ed.2d 664 (1990), and in any event are precluded from raising the issue by their failure to object to the instruction on the wrongful termination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p>IX. DEFENDANT BENSON'S APPEAL OF THE TITLE VII CLAIMS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Benson asks this court to vacate the Title VII liability findings against him in favor of both Scarfo and Miller and to determine that the district court should have dismissed the Title VII claim against him because, as a matter of law, an individual cannot be liable under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benson squarely raised this issue in a motion for summary judgment filed against plaintiff Miller.  Appellant Benson concedes that he did not seek summary judgment against the other plaintiff, Scarfo, on this ground.  He contends, though, that the district judge's later consolidation of plaintiffs' cases and express order that the defendants' motion for summary judgment in the Miller case be transferred to the main case and considered re-filed in that case, rendered the summary judgment motion applicable to plaintiff Scarfo.  We decline to accept this contention.  To accept it would imply that it would be appropriate to enter summary judgment against a party who never had explicit notice that her opponent had moved for summary judgment against her.  Therefore, we consider Benson's contentions only as they apply to his appeal of the judgment against him for his retaliatory firing of Miller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial court denied Benson's motion for summary judgment as to Miller's claim of individual Title VII liability, Benson did not raise the issue again in the trial court on a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Thus, the claim of error by the trial court in concluding, as a basis for denying summary judgment, that Miller may be held individually liable is not available for review under a standard as favorable to appellants as the harmless error standard.  See Eastern Mount.  Platform Tennis, 40 F.3d at 497.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction on Benson's individual liability under Title VII may or may not have been erroneous.  The trial judge made clear that on this point he was adopting the view of a district court of this circuit, and arguably the view of some circuits, over the plainly contrary view of other circuits.  As was true of the issue of municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 in Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981), the court's interpretation of the \"contours of ...

PLAINTIFF SCARFO'S PRINCIPAL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Components of Scarfo's Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo was awarded damages on two of her claims:  the Title VII sex discrimination claim and the Equal Pay Act claim.  We discuss each of these awards in turn.  To aid the reader in understanding the damages analysis, we note that the following dates are relevant to Plaintiff Scarfo's damages.  Plaintiff Scarfo was terminated on January 10, 1991.  Plaintiff Scarfo filed a claim with the EEOC on March 6, 1991 and filed this civil action with the court below on October 8, 1991.  The first of the Orders that, together, constitute the final judgment in this case was entered on May 10, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Title VII Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages awarded to plaintiff Scarfo by the trial court for her successful Title VII claim consist of three types:  back pay, front pay, and damages for the value of stock options that plaintiff did not receive as a result of the discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded plaintiff Scarfo $1,187,901.07 in damages for the Title VII violation (consisting of the sum of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock, reduced by the jury's award of $28,000 under the Equal Pay Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term back pay refers to lost wages commencing on the date two years before the plaintiff's filing with the EEOC to the date of judgment.  Front pay refers to damages for wages from the date of judgment to some specified date in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The back pay and front pay damages awarded by the trial court are to some extent overlapping and must be modified for reasons explained in Part XI.C below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Equal Pay Act Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded plaintiff Scarfo $28,000 in damages for defendant Cabletron's violation of the Equal Pay Act.  The trial court instructed the jury that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p>Under the Equal Pay Act, Ms. Scarfo's award of unpaid wages is limited to a period of two years prior to filing this lawsuit and extending until her termination unless she proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was willful.  If you find that Cabletron acted willfully, then Ms. Scarfo may recover unpaid wages for a period of three years prior to filing this lawsuit and extending until her termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p>Cf. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no need to decide, and thus refrain from deciding, whether this instruction on the law was accurate because neither party objected to the instruction at trial and neither has raised the issue before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special verdict form does not indicate whether the jury found that the defendant's violation was willful.  Thus, assuming, as we must, that the jury followed the court's instructions, the jury's award represents the damages for the time span from October 8 of either 1988 or 1989 up to January 10 of 1991, when plaintiff Scarfo was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither plaintiff Scarfo nor defendant Cabletron challenges the jury's award under the Equal Pay Act of $28,000.  There is a lack of clarity in the briefs and record, however, about whether this recovery is in addition to the recovery for violation of Title VII.  We discuss this issue in Parts XI.A.3 and XI.E below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Combining to a Nonduplicative Total</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The award under Title VII is to some extent duplicative of the award under the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently to avoid a duplicate recovery, the trial court subtracted the jury's award of $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation committed by Cabletron from the court's total calculation of $1,215,901.07 (consisting of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock options) in damages for the Title VII violation committed by Cabletron and Benson, resulting in what the court determined was the total Title VII award of $1,187,901.07 against Benson and Cabletron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, under the final judgment entered in the case by the court below, defendants Cabletron and Benson were held jointly and severally liable for $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII violation and Cabletron was held liable for an additional $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.  Since Benson was not liable under the Equal Pay Act, there is a problem about subtracting $28,000 from the award against Benson to avoid duplicative recovery.  We address this problem in Part XI.E below, along with the need for other modifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants Cabletron and Benson raise arguments with respect to all three components of Scarfo's Title VII award.  We discuss each component in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the court awarded Scarfo back pay for the Title VII claim in the amount of $242,407.07 (before reduction by $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act award).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII permits an award of back pay starting two years before the date of the filing of plaintiff's complaint with the EEOC (two years before March 6, 1991) up until the date of judgment.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000-5(g).  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo is entitled to back pay from March 6, 1989 to May 10, 1994.  From March 6, 1989 to the date of her termination, January 10, 1991, the damages represent the amount that she was underpaid because of discrimination on the basis of her sex.  From January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994, damages represent the amount she should have been paid, if she had not been terminated on the basis of her sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court performed a detailed set of calculations based on evidence admitted at trial and awarded Scarfo $242,407.07 in back pay (before reduction to avoid duplication).  See Addendum to Court's Order of May 9, 1994.  These calculations separate the time period for back pay into the relevant sub-periods and use the salary rate of an arguably equivalent male employee (as a proxy for what plaintiff Scarfo would have earned in the absence of discrimination) to calculate the damages for each day of each sub-period.  Although defendants raise several arguments with respect to these calculations, we determine that the court's findings of fact are not \"clearly erroneous\" and the method of performing the calculations was in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In particular, the defendants criticize the trial court's use of the salaries of two other Cabletron employees, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Jacob, in the calculations.  Defendants argue that the trial court erred in comparing plaintiff Scarfo to these two employees because these two employees had greater responsibilities at Cabletron.  This argument fails because the trial court reasonably could have determined that Scarfo either had a similar level of responsibility or would have been given similar responsibilities but for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court calculated damages up until May 4, 1994, only, instead of May 10, 1994.  No party, however, has raised any issue on appeal regarding this period of approximately one week, and we do not disturb the trial court's calculations in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Scarfo's Front Pay Award</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded Scarfo $744,744 as front pay.  In a Title VII case, the court has discretion to award front pay from the date of judgment forward when reinstatement is impracticable or impossible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p233\">\n      <span class=\"num\">233</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Goss v. Exxon Office Sys. Co., 747 F.2d 885, 890 (3d Cir.1984) (\"The award of future lost earnings in Title VII cases is an alternative to the traditional equitable remedy of reinstatement.\");</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p234\">\n      <span class=\"num\">234</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cf. Wildman v. Lerner Stores, 771 F.2d 605 (1st Cir.1985) (court has same discretion to award front pay under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p235\">\n      <span class=\"num\">235</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court will disturb a trial court's front pay award only if we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, or that findings of fact on which the award was based are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court, in its Order of May 10, made the finding that plaintiff Scarfo did not have \"the option of returning to her former position at Cabletron.\"   Defendant Cabletron does not challenge this finding, nor is it clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found that plaintiff Scarfo \"is a displaced worker and will be unable to find professional employment in the future.\"   Although defendants challenge this determination, the record shows that the court heard expert testimony on the likelihood that plaintiff Scarfo would be able to find an equivalent job with the same earning potential.  In light of the evidence that she had only a ten percent chance of returning to full employment at an equivalent salary, the court's finding that Scarfo will be unable to find professional employment in the future is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the \"court imported the erroneous concept of displaced worker into the case.\"   The court did not explain the meaning of \"displaced worker,\" nor has our attention been called to any published opinion that uses this terminology in the Title VII context.  In any event, regardless of the terminology used, plaintiff Scarfo's ability to find similar employment in the future is relevant both to the trial court's decision to award front pay and to the calculation of such an award.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding front pay to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calculating Scarfo's front pay award, the court adopted the calculations of plaintiff's expert witness.  Defendants do not dispute that these calculations were admissible and were adequately explained by the expert's report and testimony;  rather, they now question merely the weight the court gave to this evidence by pointing out concessions made by the expert during the cross-examination.  The defendants' contentions fail because the choice by the court, as factfinder for the purpose of calculating damages, to give probative weight to the expert's calculations was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In another respect, however, we conclude that the court erred in adopting and using the expert's calculations as a measure of front pay.  The expert's calculation of damages in the amount of $973,494, which the court adopted for Scarfo's front pay award, was for a period commencing on January 1, 1991.  As stated above, \"front pay\" usually refers to an award for future salary payments starting on the date of the judgment, in this case, May 10, 1994.  Since the court, in addition to its front pay award, also awarded back pay for the time period up until the date of the verdict on May 4, 1994, plaintiff Scarfo obtained duplicate damages for the period from January 1, 1991 to May 4, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he law abhors duplicative recoveries.  That is to say, a plaintiff who is injured by reason of a defendant's behavior is, for the most part, entitled to be made whole--not to be enriched.\"  Dopp v. HTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 516 (1st Cir.1991).  The court adopted the expert's calculations for the front pay award and performed its own calculations to determine the back pay award.  Thus, the amounts of the front pay and back pay awards representing the period from January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 are different because the expert and the court employed different methods to calculate damages.  To avoid duplicative recovery, plaintiff Scarfo's combined total of Title VII damages should be reduced either by the amount the court awarded as back pay for the period from January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994, or by the amount the court ordered as front pay for that same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For two reasons we choose the latter method of determining the measure of the duplication that must be avoided.  First, unlike the court's calculations for that period, the expert's calculations include social security contributions and fringe benefits.  Therefore, the amount derived from the expert's calculations is a larger amount than the amount calculated by the court for that period.  Thus, it is more consistent with our goal of modification only as needed to avoid duplicative recovery to decrease the total award by the smaller amount, that is the amount the court calculated for back pay for that period.  Second, since the expert's calculations were computed on an annual basis and the court's calculations were computed on a daily basis, using the back pay measure calculated by the court for the period from January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994 makes for an easier and more precise calculation of the duplication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the trial court calculated plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07 (before adjustment for the Equal Pay Act award) consisting of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock options.  The portion of the court's back pay award attributable to the period for January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 is $224,013.12.  Thus, to avoid duplication, we reduce the court's calculation of Title VII damages by $224,013.12, resulting in a back pay award of $18,393.95 ($242,407.07 less $224,013.12), and a total sum of Title VII damages (before adjustment with respect to Cabletron for the Equal Pay Act award) of $991,887.95, consisting of $18,393.95 for the period up to January 10, 1991, $744,744 for the period commencing January 10, 1991, and $228,750 for the value of stock options.  Both defendants Cabletron and Benson are jointly and severally liable for this amount.  This amount does not include the adjustment (discussed below in Part XI.E) for the jury's Equal Pay Act award against Cabletron only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded damages to plaintiff Scarfo for the value of stock options she would have received if she had not been discriminated against on the basis of sex.  The court found that Scarfo would have been given options to purchase 2500 shares of stock at a purchase price of $15.50.  The court found that the value of the stock was $107.00 per share around the time of the trial and awarded Scarfo $228,750 in damages ($107.00 minus $15.50 times 2,500).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants raise only one argument with respect to this damages award;  they say that Scarfo is barred from recovering these damages on the basis of res judicata.  Before filing the civil action in federal court, Scarfo filed an action with the New Hampshire Department of Labor.  In that action, the plaintiff sought to recover compensation under N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51 (authorizing the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Labor to hold hearings to enforce the provisions of certain New Hampshire labor laws).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Labor determined, inter alia, that stock options were not \"compensation\" and thus not recoverable under N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her amended complaint to the trial court below, Scarfo sought to recover lost wages and stock options on a breach of contract theory.  The district judge dismissed the breach of contract claim on the basis of res judicata because it stated the same cause of action the plaintiff had already adjudicated under N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert that because the plaintiff was barred from recovering damages for stock options under a breach of contract theory, the plaintiff should be barred from recovering damages for stock options under a Title VII sex discrimination theory.  This argument lacks merit.  Under defendants' reasoning, the plaintiff would be barred from recovering any type of lost compensation (including wages) under Title VII, because she had adjudicated a breach of contract claim for lost wages and other compensation in the Department of Labor proceedings.  But res judicata bars causes of action, not types of damages recoverable under some other claim not subject to adjudication in the tribunal rendering the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See In re Alfred P., 126 N.H. 628, 629, 495 A.2d 1264 (1985) (\"The doctrine of res judicata precludes the litigation in a later case of matters actually litigated, and matters that could have been litigated, in an earlier action between the same parties for the same cause of action.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's Title VII cause of action is not the same cause of action as her breach of contract action;  it requires different elements to be proved.  These different elements were not tried, and could not have been tried, in the New Hampshire Department of Labor hearings.  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII claim is not barred by res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the defendants raise no other arguments with respect to the trial court's award of $228,750 for the value of stock options not received by plaintiff Scarfo, we do not disturb the trial court's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p>E. Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described above, the trial court originally calculated Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07.  Then, recognizing the need to avoid duplicative recovery, the court subtracted $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act claim.  Thus, under the final judgment entered by the court (as gleaned from the collection of Orders referred to in Part II, supra ) Cabletron was held liable for $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII violation and $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court erred in subtracting the Equal Pay Act award from the back pay component of the court's Title VII award.  We agree that the method used by the trial court to avoid duplicate recoveries was at best confusing, if not erroneous, for two reasons.  First, the back pay component of the Title VII damages award and the jury's Equal Pay Act award represent damages for different time periods.  Second, only defendant Cabletron (and not defendant Benson) is liable under the Equal Pay Act.  Thus, we make the following additional adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Part XI.C above, our modification of the total Title VII damages resulted in a calculation of Title VII damages in the amount of $991,887.95.  The remaining question before us is how appropriately to modify this award to avoid duplicative recovery by plaintiff Scarfo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The portion of our modified Title VII damages calculation representing damages from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 is $18,393.95.  The jury's Equal Pay Act award of $28,000 represents damages for the same injury, namely discrimination in pay on the basis of sex, for a period commencing either October 8, 1988 or October 8, 1989 and extending to January 10, 1991, the date of her termination.  Thus, regardless of whether the jury found willfulness, these time periods overlap to some extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider separately the two cases (the two different periods, and as a result the two different methods of calculation to avoid an overlap).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the jury found wilfulness, the EPA award of $28,000 represents the period from October 8, 1988 to January 10, 1991.  This time period is longer than, and includes entirely the time period of March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991, for which damages were calculated at $18,393.95.  Thus, if the jury found wilfulness, the appropriate way to avoid duplicative recovery is to reduce the Equal Pay Act award by $18,393.95, so that Cabletron is liable to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95 for the Title VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p260\">\n      <span class=\"num\">260</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the jury did not find wilfulness, the Equal Pay Act award of $28,000 represents the period from October 8, 1989 to January 10, 1991.  This is a shorter time period than the time period from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 for which the judge awarded $18,393.95.  If we could determine that the jury did not find wilfulness, the more accurate adjustment we could make to avoid duplicative recovery would be to reduce the Equal Pay Act award by $12,367.55, the amount of the Title VII award representing damages from October 8, 1989 to January 1, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p261\">\n      <span class=\"num\">261</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we cannot determine whether the jury found wilfulness, we conclude that it is appropriate in these circumstances to accept the reduction of $18,393.95 as an appropriate adjustment to avoid overlap (instead of the reduction of $12,367.55).  If, in fact, the jury's award was not based on a finding of wilfulness and accordingly the appropriate adjustment is a reduction of $12,367.55, then the prejudice to plaintiff Scarfo is quite small (i.e., $6,026.40) in comparison either with her total recovery or with the cost to her, as well as to opposing parties and the public, of a remand for a new trial on the sole issue of whether Cabletron's Equal Pay Act violation was wilful.  Having failed to request an explicit jury finding as to wilfulness, Scarfo is in no position to complain of this resolution of the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p262\">\n      <span class=\"num\">262</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, after the reduction of $18,393.95 to avoid overlap, Cabletron is liable to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95 for the Title VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p263\">\n      <span class=\"num\">263</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Equal Pay Act claim was not brought against defendant Benson, Benson is liable only for Title VII damages.  In accordance with the explanation above, Benson is jointly and severally liable to Scarfo for Title VII damage totalling $991,887.95 consisting of $18,393.95 for the period before January 10, 1991;  $744,744 for the period after January 10, 1991;  and $228,750 in stock options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p264\">\n      <span class=\"num\">264</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that these adjusted calculations are not intended to alter the usual terminology and relevant time periods for damages under Title VII.  As explained above, a successful plaintiff (one who has proved liability under Title VII) is entitled to back pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date two years before the plaintiff's EEOC filing and continuing until the date of judgment.  A court, in its discretion, may also award front pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date of judgment and continuing to some specified date in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XII. PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p265\">\n      <span class=\"num\">265</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found defendants Cabletron and Benson liable to plaintiff Miller under Title VII for retaliatory discharge.  The court awarded plaintiff Miller $190,651.85 in back pay representing lost compensation from the date of his discharge to the date of judgment.  The court awarded Miller $995,000 in front pay purportedly representing lost compensation from the date of judgment forward.  The court also awarded Miller $206,060 for the value of stock options that he did not receive because of his discharge.  These three calculations total $1,391,711.85 in damages for the Title VII violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p266\">\n      <span class=\"num\">266</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants raise no arguments with respect to the court's back pay award of $190,651.85.  We discuss, in turn, the defendants arguments with respect to the front pay damages and the damages for the value of the stock options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Miller's Damages for Front Pay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p267\">\n      <span class=\"num\">267</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court's method of calculating damages for front pay was an abuse of discretion.  The jury awarded plaintiff Miller $995,000 in damages for Miller's wrongful discharge claim under New Hampshire state law.  The court, for a reason not stated, assumed that this sum represented damages for front pay only.  Thus, the court incorporated this sum of $995,000 into the court's calculations of Title VII damages as the damages for front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, we review a court's decision to award front pay damages under the abuse-of-discretion standard.  We conclude that the defendants are correct in asserting that the court's decision to use the jury's figure of $995,000 for front pay damages was an abuse of discretion because the jury's award may have included some back pay, some amount for the value of the stock options, and some amount as damages for pain and suffering.  Plaintiff Miller, in a post-trial motion and in his brief as appellee, agrees that the court erred in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p269\">\n      <span class=\"num\">269</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was instructed that if it found Cabletron liable on the state law wrongful termination claim, it must consider two types of damages:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p270\">\n      <span class=\"num\">270</span>\n      <p>First, you must determine the amount of wages and fringe benefits he would have earned through employment with defendant Cabletron ... if he had not been discharged on May 30th, 1990, to the date of your verdict.  Second, you must determine the amount of future wages and fringe benefits he reasonably would have earned in his employment with Cabletron if he had not been discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction clearly permits the jury to award both back-pay damages and front-pay damages.  The verdict form did not require the jury to report the two separately.  The $995,000 awarded by the jury is reasonably interpreted as an award for both back pay and front pay.  As explained above, the $995,000 may have included, also, damages for pain and suffering.  Thus, the court erred in using the jury's award on the state law wrongful termination claim as the measure of front pay damages under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p272\">\n      <span class=\"num\">272</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, plaintiff Miller's expert testified that $211,000 was the appropriate award for front-pay damages.  Plaintiff Miller has asked this court, in correcting for this error, to reduce the award for front-pay damages from $995,000 to $211,000, the amount calculated by plaintiff Miller's expert.  Defendants Cabletron and Benson argue that this court should vacate the entire award for front pay because the trial court abused its discretion in deciding to make any award for front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below found that Miller did make reasonable efforts to procure employment, but that the courier business he began in 1991 has not yet made a profit.  We will not disturb this finding of fact because the defendants have not shown it to be clearly erroneous.  From this finding, we infer that the court also found that it was impracticable for Miller to return to Cabletron and that Miller had made reasonable efforts to find a job with the same earning capacity.  Miller is thus entitled to damages for front pay.  The court's determination that Miller was entitled to an award of front pay was not an abuse of discretion, and we will not disturb that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p274\">\n      <span class=\"num\">274</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's proposal to this court that the award be reduced from $995,000 to $211,000--if the proposal had been made to and accepted by the trial court--has evidentiary support in the testimony of plaintiff's expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p275\">\n      <span class=\"num\">275</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has authority to modify a damages award when all the necessary factfindings have been made in the court below.  Cf. Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 943 (modifying an award of fair and reasonable attorneys' fees when the trial court made a legal error with respect to the method of calculation).  Reducing the award to $211,000, however, as plaintiff Miller requests, would require this court to evaluate the credibility of the plaintiff's expert and to make a new finding of fact, not made in the trial court, that Miller is entitled to $211,000 in damages for front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p276\">\n      <span class=\"num\">276</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we do not have the authority to make findings of fact in order to modify the award in the manner requested by plaintiff, we vacate the front pay award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p277\">\n      <span class=\"num\">277</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate amount for the front pay award.  The district court, on remand, may allow the interested parties a reasonable time period within which to file with the district court a stipulation resolving this issue (for example, a stipulation such as Miller's proposal to this court that his award for front pay be reduced to $211,000 and judgment be entered accordingly).  If no such agreement is filed, the trial court is to determine the amount of the award to Miller for front pay.  The trial court may find it appropriate to act on the present record of evidence and adopt the plaintiff's calculation of $211,000 for front pay.  It may instead calculate front pay damages from the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) forward in some other manner supported by the present record of evidence.  Also, the court, in its discretion and for cause shown, may receive additional evidence bearing upon this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p278\">\n      <span class=\"num\">278</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his employment, plaintiff Miller was told that, over a specific period of time, he would be given stock options that would allow him to purchase 10,000 shares of stock at a purchase price of $3.97 per share.  During his employment, he received options to purchase only 2,000 shares.  During the time period from the date of his termination (April 20, 1990) to the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) Miller alleges that he would have received options to purchase 5,000 shares.  Miller also alleges that within a month of the date of judgment, his right to options with respect to the remaining 3,000 shares would have vested.  Thus, Miller's counsel argued to the trial court that Miller should have been awarded damages for the value of options for 8,000 shares of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p279\">\n      <span class=\"num\">279</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded plaintiff Miller $206,060 in damages for the value of 2,000 shares of stock.  The court did not explain how it determined the number 2,000 to be the number of shares of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p280\">\n      <span class=\"num\">280</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-appellants, in their brief on appeal, do not dispute the facts, as alleged by plaintiff Miller, regarding the options for 10,000 shares.  In an effort to point out all potential errors made by the district court in support of their argument that this court should vacate both awards entirely, they argue that the trial court erred in deciding to award Miller the value of 2,000 stock options.  Defendants suggest that the trial court mistakenly thought that Miller had already received stock options for 8,000 of the 10,000 shares, when, in fact, this was the amount he had not received because of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p281\">\n      <span class=\"num\">281</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The brief of appellee Miller agrees that the court erred, and suggests (adopting defendants' reasoning in part) that the court should have awarded $824,240, the value of stock options for 8,000 shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p282\">\n      <span class=\"num\">282</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The implications of defendants' argument on appeal are troubling.  They have requested, in the event that this court does not reverse the liability determination on Miller's Title VII claim, that this court set aside Miller's entire damages award and remand.  If the remand were limited to trial of the issue of damages for the value of stock, however, the trial court might award either the value of 5,000 shares of stock (the amount vesting before the date of judgment), or the value of 8,000 shares of stock.  In either case, the probable consequence of retrying only this issue would be an additional liability, beyond that already awarded by the trial court, of either $309,090 or $618,180 in favor of plaintiff Miller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p283\">\n      <span class=\"num\">283</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's brief as appellee requests that this court award damages for the value of stock options for 8,000 shares.  Defendants respond that we should not grant this request (which would increase the total damages award) because plaintiff Miller did not appeal the award of damages in his cross-appeal;  rather, plaintiff Miller raised this argument only in its appellee brief responding to the defendants' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p284\">\n      <span class=\"num\">284</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refrain from modifying the judgment to award the value of 8,000 stock options because to do so would require this court to make new findings of fact.  We also refrain from remanding this issue to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate award for the value of lost stock options because neither party has requested that we do so.  Both parties have requested that this court take actions that are beyond this court's authority.  Since neither party's position has merit, we simply affirm the trial court's award of $206,060 for the value of stock options for 2,000 shares of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XIII. PREJUDGMENT INTEREST</p>\n    <p>A. The Arguments of the Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p285\">\n      <span class=\"num\">285</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some confusion both in the record and in the parties' briefs about whether the court awarded prejudgment interest on any part of Scarfo's damages award and whether prejudgment interest, if awarded, was appropriate.  Defendants argue that the court awarded prejudgment interest on Scarfo's Title VII award, and that this was error.  Plaintiff Scarfo argues that the trial court refused to award prejudgment interest on Scarfo's Title VII award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p286\">\n      <span class=\"num\">286</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from a review of the record that the trial court denied prejudgment interest on every element of the award to plaintiff Scarfo.  In answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury answered \"NO,\" finding against Scarfo on her prejudgment interest claim.  By its Order of July 20, 1994, the court stated as to all of Scarfo's claims, \"Prejudgment interest is disallowed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p287\">\n      <span class=\"num\">287</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the judgment for plaintiff Miller, the defendants have not raised on appeal any objection to the trial court's award of prejudgment interest on Miller's state law wrongful termination claim at the rate of 10% per annum, as mandated by N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 524:1-b and Sec. 336:1.  With respect to Miller's Title VII award, however, there is some confusion in the parties' briefs about whether the parties understood that the court awarded prejudgment interest on any part of the award.  The parties' briefs assume that prejudgment interest was awarded on the entire Title VII award.  From this premise, the parties dispute whether it was appropriate for the court to award prejudgment interest on the front pay award and the portion of the back pay award representing damages for the period from the date Miller's complaint was filed to the date of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p288\">\n      <span class=\"num\">288</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from a review of the record that the trial court allowed prejudgment interest on Miller's state law claim for wrongful termination, but not on any aspect of his Title VII claim.  In its answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury answered \"NO,\" thus finding against Miller on his claim for prejudgment interest.  But in his Order of July 19, 1994, the trial judge \"abrogate[d]\" that finding insofar as it applied to the state law claim for wrongful termination and awarded Miller prejudgment interest from the date of filing of the complaint to the date of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p289\">\n      <span class=\"num\">289</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since, contrary to the contentions of the parties, we have concluded that the trial court did not award prejudgment interest on plaintiff Scarfo's and plaintiff Miller's Title VII awards, the only question remaining is whether the trial court erred by denying prejudgment interest on all aspects of the plaintiffs' Title VII awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p290\">\n      <span class=\"num\">290</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court has discretion whether to award prejudgment interest on a successful Title VII claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p291\">\n      <span class=\"num\">291</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Earnhardt v. Puerto Rico, 744 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1984) (in a Title VII case the question of \"whether [prejudgment interest is] necessary to make the plaintiff whole is within the discretion of the district court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p292\">\n      <span class=\"num\">292</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the discretion allowed the trial court as to interest on a Title VII award, we conclude, in the circumstances of this case, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award prejudgment interest on the Title VII award.  Thus, as stated below in the Conclusion, we affirm the trial court's decision not to award prejudgment interest on both plaintiffs' Title VII claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Front Pay Awards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p293\">\n      <span class=\"num\">293</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For an additional reason, we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the front pay components of both plaintiffs' Title VII damages awards.  Interest is ordinarily awarded to compensate for the lost use of funds.  Since the front pay awards represent damages for wages the plaintiffs would have received in the future, after the date of judgment, the plaintiffs had not lost use of these funds before the judgment was ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p294\">\n      <span class=\"num\">294</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cf. Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., 402 Mass. 385, 523 N.E.2d 255, 258-59 (1988) (prejudgment interest is not available under Massachusetts law for awards of front pay for violations of a Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p295\">\n      <span class=\"num\">295</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the plaintiffs' experts, in calculating damages for front pay, correctly chose to discount the amounts representing the plaintiffs' future wages at an appropriate interest rate in order to determine the present value of the future stream of income to which each plaintiff would have been entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p296\">\n      <span class=\"num\">296</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as stated in the Conclusion below, we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the front pay components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Awards for the Value of Stock Options</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p297\">\n      <span class=\"num\">297</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, defendants argue that prejudgment interest should not be awarded on the value of the stock options, since the amount of damages was based on the price of the stock on or near the date of judgment.  If the plaintiffs had received the stock options at the time due and had not transferred them, the plaintiffs would have been in possession of shares of stock having the value equal to the purchase price plus the amount of damages.  Thus, the damages awards for the stock options already represent the present value of the stock options at the date of judgment.  We conclude that an award of prejudgment interest is not necessary to compensate the plaintiffs.  Although a reasonable argument may be made that prejudgment interest is an appropriate remedy for the loss of dividends that would have been paid to plaintiffs if they had been in possession of the stock during the period to which they were entitled to it, neither party has argued this proposition.  Since both plaintiffs have conceded either explicitly (in Miller's case) or implicitly (in Scarfo's case, to the extent she argues that prejudgment interest was not even awarded) that prejudgment interest on the value of the stock options is not appropriate, we refrain from addressing the argument that prejudgment interest may be awarded as compensation for lost dividends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p298\">\n      <span class=\"num\">298</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, defendants and plaintiffs agree that prejudgment interest was inappropriate on the damages for stock options and we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the stock options components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XIV. MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p299\">\n      <span class=\"num\">299</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The orders of the district court that we have determined to be the functional equivalent of a final judgment are silent, and thus perhaps ambiguous, with respect to the effect of the overlap between the judgment for plaintiff Miller on the jury finding of damages in the state law wrongful termination claim and the judgment for plaintiff Miller in the court's findings of damages in the Title VII claim.  Separate awards were made for these two claims, but nothing is stated explicitly about whether and to what extent, and with what effect on collectibility, the elements of harm for which damages are awarded under the two claims overlap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p300\">\n      <span class=\"num\">300</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the parties brought this matter to the attention of the trial court.  Each party may have been reluctant to do so for fear the ambiguity would then be resolved against it.  Having chosen instead to argue their respective positions only on appeal, however, no party is in a favorable position to seek an award of costs of appeal.  We award no costs of appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of the district court with respect to Miller's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p301\">\n      <span class=\"num\">301</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To eliminate any uncertainty, we state our determination of the meaning of the judgment, with the modifications we order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p302\">\n      <span class=\"num\">302</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Miller prevailed on two claims:  his state law claim for wrongful discharge against Cabletron (and not Benson) and his federal Title VII claim for retaliatory discharge against Cabletron and Benson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p303\">\n      <span class=\"num\">303</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Miller was awarded $995,000 with prejudgment interest at a rate of 10% per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint to the date of the verdict (May 4, 1994) on his New Hampshire state law claim for wrongful termination against Cabletron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p304\">\n      <span class=\"num\">304</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After modification by this court, plaintiff Miller is entitled to three types of damages for his Title VII claim against Cabletron and Benson.

She did not prevail on her claim of sexual harassment against Benson or Cabletron.  Her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Cabletron was dismissed, and she lost on the same claim against Benson at trial.  Her claim of breach of contract was dismissed on the ground of res judicata.  The defamation claim was not pressed at trial, apparently because it was settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p313\">\n      <span class=\"num\">313</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller prevailed against Cabletron and Benson on his Title VII claim for retaliatory discharge, and against Cabletron on his state-law wrongful termination claim.  Although he lost none of his claims that went to the jury (except for prejudgment interest), Miller's claims for abuse of process and intentional infliction of emotional distress were apparently dismissed before or during trial, although on the record before us we cannot tell under what circumstances or on what terms they were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p314\">\n      <span class=\"num\">314</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following trial, the court received briefs and held a hearing to determine attorneys' fees.  The court awarded fees to Scarfo in the amounts of $225,300.13 for services of the firm that handled the bulk of her case and $18,955 for the services of a firm that handled a small part of the case.  The court awarded fees to Miller in the amount of $117,510.97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p315\">\n      <span class=\"num\">315</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the trial court improperly awarded Miller fees related to claims on which he did not prevail at trial--apparently, the dismissed claims of abuse of process and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Yet appellants have failed to provide this court with a record from which we could determine whether the award included the cost of prosecuting these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p316\">\n      <span class=\"num\">316</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the trial court's order awarding attorneys' fees to Miller that the court had before it a detailed bill for Miller's attorneys' services.  Appellants have not made that bill, or any other information sufficient to support a reasoned decision by this court, a part of the record.  This court therefore has no basis for determining whether there is any truth to appellants' assertion that the fee award against them included the cost of litigating claims on which Miller did not prevail at trial.  In these circumstances, we do not reach the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in its award of fees for the simple reason that we have no basis for a reasoned decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p317\">\n      <span class=\"num\">317</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an appellant fails to provide a record of evidence material to the point the appellant wishes to raise, and thus leaves the appellate court with an insufficient basis to make a reasoned decision, the court in its discretion may either consider the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal if the absence of a full record thwarts intelligent and reasoned review.  See Moore, 47 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p318\">\n      <span class=\"num\">318</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the district court did not reduce the award to Scarfo to account for her unsuccessful claims.  The support for this assertion consists primarily of a listing of the claims on which plaintiffs did not prevail.  Appellants cite a statement of the trial court in a related case in which the court acknowledged that the Title VII and state-law claims involved different defenses and varying remedies, as well as novel issues of state law.  Appellants also assert that plaintiffs \"failed to establish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly failed to explain many of the general entries which were made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p319\">\n      <span class=\"num\">319</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Scarfo's lead counsel regarding Scarfo's counsel fees.  Counsel testified that the proffered itemized bill did not include work relating to the defamation claim, or work solely related to the harassment claim or the emotional distress claim.  She also testified that the fees for which her client sought reimbursement were $75,000 less than the total fees charged.  Counsel was subjected to fairly detailed cross-examination, especially regarding the fees attributable to the sexual harassment claim;  cross-examination on that topic focused especially on fees for research undertaken on February 2 and February 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p320\">\n      <span class=\"num\">320</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that on these two dates, February 2 and 5, 1993, research was undertaken on issues on which plaintiff did not prevail, but that \"the issues are interwoven.\"   The court stated that it was reducing the charges allowed for those two days by 50% to $427.50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p321\">\n      <span class=\"num\">321</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An award of fees under Title VII is reviewed primarily under an abuse of discretion standard, and the trial court's range of discretion is particularly broad.  See Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group, Inc., 984 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1993).  That range extends to determining the portion of bills for services to be awarded to parties who have won on only some of their claims, as long as the trial court considers the relevant factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p322\">\n      <span class=\"num\">322</span>\n      <p>Where, as here, plaintiffs have won a federal claim for which attorneys' fees are allowed to a prevailing party, the question becomes whether the claims on which they lost in the same suit were unrelated to the successful ones (in which event no fees may be awarded for work on the unsuccessful claims), or whether, instead, the losing claims included \"a common core of facts,\" or were \"based on related legal theories,\" linking them to the successful claim.

Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 527 (1st Cir.1991) (court must make concrete findings and explain its reasoning).  The district court's explanation of the bases for its conclusions is essential to meaningful appellate review.  Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 950 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p329\">\n      <span class=\"num\">329</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear exactly what the legal basis is for appellants' request for a remand.  That is, it is not clear whether appellants are contending that the district court did not conduct the analysis required by Hensley in cases of interrelated claims, or, instead are contending that the court conducted the analysis, but came to the wrong conclusion.  We consider, and reject, both possibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p330\">\n      <span class=\"num\">330</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants overstate their case when they assert that the court \"made no reduction for counsel fees as a result\" of unsuccessful claims.  The district court specifically found that on two dates (February 2 and 5, 1993) research was undertaken on issues on which plaintiffs did not prevail, but that \"the issues are interwoven\";  the court stated that it was reducing the charges allowed for those two days by 50%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p331\">\n      <span class=\"num\">331</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we interpret the statement that \"the issues are interwoven\" as having been intended to invoke the Hensley analysis, it is, to be sure, not a sufficient explanation of the basis of the court's award of fees in a case of purportedly interrelated claims.  It falls short of the \"thorough and detailed opinion reviewing the imbrication between the successful and unsuccessful claims\" that was before the court in Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.   In the present case, the district court did not--as far as we can tell on the record before us--\"make clear that it considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the result obtained.\"   See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.   The court's order does not reflect a Hensley analysis of the relationship among the claims;  in fact, it does not indicate what issues the court has determined to be interrelated, or even whether they are issues of fact or law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p332\">\n      <span class=\"num\">332</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, our review of the record leads us to conclude that Scarfo's claims of sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress shared sufficient common issues of fact with her successful claims under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act to justify the award made in this case.  In any event, we conclude that appellants should not now be heard on their request for remand because they did not adequately present this issue to the trial court or in the briefs filed with this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p333\">\n      <span class=\"num\">333</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's order, it is true, does not address the nature of legal work performed by Scarfo's counsel beyond the research billed for February 2 and February 5, 1993.  But we will not ourselves consider, or remand to the district court for consideration of, a blanket request not specific enough for reasoned evaluation of the merits of the request.  Appellants have failed to meet their burden of production before the trial court and their burden of adequate briefing before this court.  This failure deprives both courts of an opportunity to make an intelligent and reasoned decision regarding the segregability of fees awarded for any work related to losing claims that took place on days other than February 2 and 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p334\">\n      <span class=\"num\">334</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties must fulfill certain obligations of specificity of grounds of claim or defense if the district court is to be able to make a reasoned decision as to a proper fee award.  The fee-seeker, for example, must provide a \"particularized account\" of his or her claim for fees.  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 527.   When a fee-seeker has not won on all counts but properly documents her claim for fees and plausibly asserts that the time cannot be allocated between successful and unsuccessful counts, it becomes the fee-target's burden to show a basis for segregability.  See Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.   Appellants failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p335\">\n      <span class=\"num\">335</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence before the district court, in the form of testimony by Scarfo's counsel, that the requested award already reflected a $75,000 deduction from overall costs to account for time spent solely on the sexual harassment and infliction of emotional distress claims;  the remainder of her firm's work on these claims, she testified, was closely related to the claims on which her client prevailed.  She also testified that the award did not include any expenses related to the defamation claim.  That testimony constituted a \"plausible assertion\" that counsel had already segregated fees to the extent practicable.  The credibility of that testimony is for the trial court, not this court, to determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p336\">\n      <span class=\"num\">336</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was free to challenge this assertion by pointing specifically to segregable aspects of the bill that formed the basis for the award.  The defendants' cross-examination of Scarfo's counsel regarding expenses billed for February 2 and February 5 apparently convinced the judge that a 50% reduction in the fees for those days was warranted, despite his conclusion that they pertained to \"interwoven\" issues.  Perhaps a further reduction in fees would have followed if defendants had presented an adequate basis for subjecting other billed hours to judicial scrutiny.  But defendants did not point to any other purportedly segregable entries in the bill submitted by Scarfo, either during cross-examination or in written submissions contained in the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p337\">\n      <span class=\"num\">337</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants did not even assert in the trial court that the award improperly included fees attributable to the defamation or breach of contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p338\">\n      <span class=\"num\">338</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' contentions at trial and before this court regarding the segregability of other claims, moreover, are merely statements of conclusions.  The written submissions to the trial court contained in the record before us merely stated conclusions that the losing claims \"have separate and distinct elements of proof requiring different testimony and documentary evidence\" or have a \"distinct and separate nature\" and are \"easily segregated.\"   Appellants' argument of segregability on appeal is even less specific than the arguments advanced before the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p339\">\n      <span class=\"num\">339</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, in which we do not even know what arguments the appellants would make on remand because they have failed to make those arguments to the trial court or to us, we conclude that it would be improper to give appellants another bite at the apple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p340\">\n      <span class=\"num\">340</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue to us that plaintiffs \"failed to establish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly failed to explain many of the general entries which were made.\"   Even if we were to construe these assertions as arguments independent of the arguments regarding segregability of fees, they are no more than statements of the conclusion appellants ask us to reach.  They do not constitute adequate explanation of a basis for reasoning to this conclusion from evidence of record.  We cannot sustain contentions of this kind.  See Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d at 352.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p341\">\n      <span class=\"num\">341</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reason, we cannot sustain appellants' argument that the award of expert fees was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XVI.

The plaintiffs Genevieve Scarfo and Brian Miller are former employees of defendant Cabletron Systems, Inc.  (\"Cabletron\").  Craig Benson and Robert Levine, supervisory employees of Cabletron, were also defendants in the district court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo claimed, inter alia, that defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and terminated her employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(f).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Miller claimed, inter alia, under Title VII for retaliatory discharge based on his alleged refusal, as plaintiff Scarfo's immediate supervisor, to discriminate against her by terminating her employment on the basis of her sex.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal claims of error asserted on appeal challenge instructions to the jury.  Each party opposing a claim of error asserts that no timely objection or request was made in the trial court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel representing defendants on appeal first came into the case after completion of the jury trial.  Not surprisingly, they seek to present contentions substantially different from those presented by defense counsel during and before the jury trial.  Whenever new counsel enter and raise new contentions, opposing counsel may find irresistible the temptation to counter with new contentions of their own.  Almost inevitably, then, the entry into a case of new counsel for one party increases litigation burdens for all parties.  An award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party may offset this burden in part.  But unfairness may remain to opposing parties if the trial or appellate court allows new grounds of claim or defense to be asserted.  For this reason, among others, we encounter a threshold question in this case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way of framing the threshold question neutrally, abjuring \"plain error,\" United States v.

This is so because rules and precedents have erected a gate at the point of entry upon each potentially promising path through the maze, and each gate is closed to appellants whose contentions have the particular characteristics of those before us in this appeal.  Thus, we affirm in substance, though with minor exceptions, and with some modification of amounts of awards, and on condition that a judgment amended as to form be entered in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first explain the terms of the judgment that was ordered in the district court and the nature of the claims of error.  Then we explain why, in the interests of justice, we hold that each claim of error asserted in this appeal is either harmless error or is raised too late for review under the harmless error standard and cannot be sustained under the more rigorous requirement that relief is to be granted only to avoid a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first error we address is one not raised by the parties.  We consider it because it might be thought to have jurisdictional implications.  The \"final judgment\" entered in this case was, in its form, not literally in compliance with the requirement that \"[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made not one but a series of orders.  In most instances, the order is not self-explanatory.  Instead, it refers to an opinion or memorandum of the court to which one must go to understand precisely the meaning of the order.  In these circumstances, if, for example, a party seeks enforcement of the judgment--perhaps even after the case is closed and the file is sent to storage--the parties and any other person required to act will have great difficulty finding out what exactly were the terms of the \"final judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of our jurisdiction, however, we conclude that the district court ordered the functional equivalent of a \"final judgment\" in a sequence of orders that includes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the \"Judgment\" of May 10, 1994 (incorporating, first, the Order of June 2, 1993 granting in part and denying in part defendants' Motion to Dismiss;  second, the Endorsed Order of November 17, 1993 concerning the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment;  third, the Special Verdicts of May 4, 1994;  fourth, the Order of May 9, 1994, concerning the Court's Calculation of Title VII Damages);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 19, 1994 on Miller's Motion for Prejudgment Interest;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 19, 1994 on Miller's Motion for Attorneys' Fees;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 19, 1994 on Scarfo's Motion for Attorneys' Fees;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Order of July 20, 1994 on Scarfo's Motion for Prejudgment and Postjudgment Interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were we to remand for entry of a \"final judgment\" that is formally in full compliance with Rule 58, before deciding the appeal that has now been briefed and argued, the case would in due course be back before us again with precisely the same issues to be decided as those we perceive from the record now before us.

Implicit in those orders and the basis on which they are explained in the memoranda referred to, however, is an assumption that the awards to plaintiff Miller overlap.  Because duplicative collection would be impermissible, we conclude it is appropriate to interpret the trial court's orders as providing that Miller not be allowed to collect more than the larger (i.e., the Title VII award) of the two awards against Cabletron.

[Ms. Scarfo h]aving done so, the defendants are liable even if they would have made the same decisions absent the discriminatory motive.   Second, she may also establish a prima facie case without direct evidence of discriminatory intent by producing indirect evidence which is sufficient to raise a presumption that absent any other explanation the defendants acted for discriminatory reasons.

Under such a principle, a clearly defined opportunity to present a contention must be exercised at a precisely defined time in the trial proceedings.  It is a now-or-never opportunity that a party must, at that precise time, use or lose.  Cf. Arenson v. Southern Univ.  Law Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7169\"><a href=\"/opinion/7169/arenson-v-southern-university-law-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 198 (5th Cir.1995) (invoking the phrase \"use it or lose it\" in relation to timeliness of motions for judgment as a matter of law and, alternatively, for a conditional new trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these contexts is the preparation of the charge to the jury, including the specific phrasing of any questions submitted to the jury.  The moment immediately before the jury retires to deliberate is a time when hard choices, with significant consequences, must be made by the parties and by the trial judge.  Interests of fairness to each party weigh heavily in favor of requiring that every other party, at this critical moment, use or lose any right to assert that the trial court should change in some way the court's instructions to the jury on the substantive law governing the case.  It is awkward to change instructions after the jury has commenced deliberating, and as a practical matter, once the jury has been disbanded after returning a verdict, it can never be called back to receive the corrected charge that the trial court might have given if asked at the right time to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to exercise the right to object to the court's charge at the critical moment prescribed by Rule 51 results in the loss of an opportunity for review under a standard no more burdensome for the appellant than the harmless error standard.  Unless the reviewing court concludes that the charge has caused a miscarriage of justice or has undermined the integrity of the judicial process, the charge is treated as having an effect closely analogous to law-of-the-case doctrine, and for similar reasons of policy and fairness of process.

If the trial counsel and the trial court are able to fashion interrogatories that disentangle law from fact and ask the jury all of the purely fact questions that are essential to determining the outcome of the case once the disputed issues of law are finally resolved, the rights of the parties to jury trial can be protected even though a final decision on critical legal issues is deferred to a later time.  If, however (either because of a preference for doing so or because of a sense that there is no other practical option) the trial court elects to submit one or more mixed law-fact questions to the jury, full protection of the rights of the parties to have their dispute resolved by the jury to whom the case is first submitted weighs compellingly in favor of the conclusion that applying the use-or-lose principle is essential to fair process and a just disposition of the controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that no party in this case is entitled to have any of the alleged errors it presents in this appeal considered under the harmless error standard of Rule 61.  The reason is that each appellant and cross-appellant now complaining of some aspect of the charge to the jury had the right and opportunity to state its contention to the trial judge after completion of the judge's charge (including the trial judge's modification of the charge after hearing objections)--and did not use it.  Having failed to make a timely objection, the complaining party is entitled to relief only to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice or otherwise to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.  In most instances, nevertheless, we have determined in our review of the record before us that we are not in \"grave doubt,\" as defined in O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, and conclude instead that correction of jury instructions at the appropriate time would not have affected the verdict in this case.  In each of those instances, since we have determined that the alleged error was harmless, it follows a fortiori that no miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before explaining the relevant characteristics of the record before us that lead to our conclusion, we pause to explain why two kinds of precedents do not apply to the kinds of claims of error before us here.

That case, however, is easily distinguished from the present appeal;  it involved equitable relief and did not involve alleged infringements of the rights of parties, in a case tried before a jury, to have disputed fact questions finally decided by the jury empaneled to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second kind of inapplicable precedent is a development under the rubric of \"waiver.\"   In criminal cases, precedents have added a distinctive element to procedural-preclusion analysis by recognizing that in some instances, even when the court is satisfied that \"plain error\" was committed, still the appealing party may be barred by circumstances that constitute \"waiver.\"   In Olano the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>Waiver is different from forfeiture.

Whether a particular right is waivable;  whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver;  whether certain procedures are required for waiver;  and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake....  Mere forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, does not extinguish an \"error\" under Rule 52(b)....

Because in this case we have concluded that we are satisfied that correction of the errors called to our attention would not have affected the verdict, in any event, we need not consider whether \"waiver\" in the Olano sense may be extended to the civil context (and might then be an additional reason for concluding that appellants (and cross-appellants) cannot prevail on this appeal).  \"Forfeiture\" in the Olano sense is a concept quite similar to principles underlying enforcement of timeliness requirements.  We next turn to applying those principles to the claims of error asserted in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>IV. ERROR IN INSTRUCTIONS ON SCARFO'S SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted in Part II.A above, the instruction on Scarfo's sex discrimination claim was flawed in its treatment of the issue of causation because it understated plaintiff's burden of proof.  Is the effect of the error so egregious as to warrant reversal even though defendants did not object at the time and in the manner prescribed by Civil Rule 51?   Because we conclude that the jury would have reached the same verdict even had it been properly instructed, the error was harmless.  Thus, it readily follows that no miscarriage of justice or other blight on the judicial process has resulted from the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of discrimination is powerful.  It contains numerous examples of Cabletron's different treatment of Scarfo and her male colleagues who were similarly situated.  On the other hand, it is also true that some evidence in the record tends to support defendants' theory that Scarfo was fired for legitimate business reasons.  In these circumstances, we must explain the evidence of record in somewhat greater detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a jury is not required to credit a plaintiff's evidence, even if the evidence is uncontradicted, and neither are we.  But a realistic assessment of the likelihood of a different verdict in this case, had different instructions been given, depends in part on an examination of the strength of Scarfo's evidence and the findings it would support.  We summarize that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strongest evidence on record supporting defendants' theory was the review of Scarfo by Brian Miller, Scarfo's immediate supervisor at Cabletron.  Miller's report contained several positive comments.  But negative remarks regarding Scarfo's management and purchasing skills dominated his review.  Miller also reported internal discipline problems in the purchasing department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on record supporting plaintiff Scarfo's theory, however, is overwhelming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Scarfo's requests to improve her department were overlooked while the same requests made by her male replacement were granted.  After Scarfo was hired as a buyer and then promoted to purchasing supervisor, she was told that she would not be eligible for a raise until July 1988.  Scarfo continued to receive a buyer's salary, though she performed all the functions of a supervisor.  But in this position she was repeatedly denied requests to hire additional buyers, train staff, and update equipment so that she could focus on her managerial duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Scarfo was terminated, Justin O'Connor, a purchasing manager, was allowed to hire additional buyers, upgrade equipment, implement training programs, and make other improvements that Scarfo had previously been refused permission to make.  Further, unlike Scarfo, O'Connor was permitted to limit his buying responsibilities so that he could devote more time to his managerial responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, when the purchasing department moved to a larger space, Scarfo was denied an office although her male colleague was given a separate office.  Craig Benson, the chief operating officer at Cabletron, did not want Scarfo to have her own office.  Benson, however, knew that Tim Jacobs, who was hired with Scarfo, would have a separate office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Scarfo's business trip expenses were carefully examined.  In contrast, the expenses of a male colleague who was on the same trip were not questioned.  Specifically, Benson examined Scarfo's expense vouchers for a two-week business trip.  He did not review expense vouchers of Roger Lawrence, a male employee who went on the same trip and whose expenses were nearly identical to those of Scarfo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Benson singled out Scarfo to take the blame for an over-purchase of circuit boards, although other employees were involved with this transaction.  Scarfo had ordered the boards, but the boards were subsequently not needed.  Although Benson knew that others besides Scarfo were responsible for this over-purchase, he told Miller, \"I don't like being ripped off, and I blame Jeanne Scarfo for this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, Scarfo was treated differently with respect to stock options.  Despite Benson's explanation that Scarfo was omitted from the stock option list and his promise that she would be on the next list of stock recipients, Scarfo, unlike her male counterparts, never received any stock options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth, in addition to the evidence of these poignant examples of disparate treatment, correlated with gender, there is in the record other strong evidence of discrimination.  Scarfo offered evidence that in April 1990, Benson told Miller to hire a \"guy\" for her position, but Miller refused.  Benson said, \"I don't care if you fire or demote her, but I want a guy in that position.\"   Approximately ten days later, Miller was fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Miller's departure, Scarfo was demoted to buyer but was asked to continue to perform all management functions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1990, when Justin O'Connor was hired as purchasing manager, Benson told him that he did not like Scarfo and urged O'Connor to fire her.  Only ten days after he came onto the job, O'Connor wrote a negative review of Scarfo and placed her on probation through February 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Connor terminated Scarfo on January 10, 1991, a month before the probationary period expired.  His reason for firing Scarfo was her failure to show improvement.  In the circumstances, it would have been difficult for O'Connor to make a reasonable determination as to whether Scarfo's performance had improved because Scarfo's time records indicated that she was legitimately absent during her probation period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into account the weight of this evidence of discrimination, we conclude that the error in the jury instructions on Scarfo's Title VII claim was not an error that \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\" Lash, 943 F.2d at 152, or caused a miscarriage of justice, Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1259.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude also that no other basis exists in the circumstances of this case to warrant an exception from applying the use-or-lose proposition stated in Rule 51 and explained, in Part III of this Opinion, as a principle aimed at achieving outcomes of jury trial that are fair and just on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. SCARFO'S EQUAL PAY ACT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By instructing the jury that plaintiff merely had to show disparity of treatment between the sexes and not sex-based discrimination, and by failing to instruct on statutory defenses included in the EPA, the trial court erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The EPA reads in relevant part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>No employer ... shall discriminate ... between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees ... at a rate less than the rate at which [the employer] pays wages to employees of the opposite sex ... for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system;  (ii) a merit system;  (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production;  or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 206(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of record overwhelmingly supports a finding for plaintiff (even under a legal standard of intended sex-based discrimination, had the instruction so required).  Defendants had the right and opportunity to object to the trial court's instruction and tell the trial judge how to correct the error.  As defendants did not use the right, we review the record before us only for evidence of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the evidence summarized in Part IV, above, we note additional support in the record for the jury's finding on the EPA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scarfo's economic expert testified that he reviewed and processed Cabletron data on pay increments, education, and employment history.  His analysis showed a $14,000 difference between male and female pay for Cabletron managers and supervisors.  The program accounted for education and seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the evidence in the record before the jury, and before us, includes data from personnel files for men and women holding similar positions.  For example, at the same time Cabletron hired Scarfo, it hired Tim Jacobs.  Unlike Scarfo, who was paid a starting salary of $27,000, Jacobs was given the title of supervisor and paid a starting salary of $35,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in 1990, Cabletron hired Justin O'Connor as purchasing manager at a salary of $65,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to justify this pay discrepancy, defendants call attention to evidence that O'Connor had more education and vastly greater experience than Scarfo.  Given the strength of the evidence supporting the EPA claim, however, it is very unlikely that the jury would have returned a different verdict had the error in the instruction been corrected before they deliberated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>VI. SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p>A. The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scarfo presents on appeal a contention that she frames as a single alleged error in the charge to the jury on her hostile environment claim.  In our view, however, the contention raises two issues that, though interwoven and related, involve distinct points, neither of which was clearly expressed in the objection before the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Scarfo argues that the court erred in instructing the jury that Scarfo had to prove \"unreasonable interference with her work performance\" as an element of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Scarfo argues, at least implicitly, that the court should have instructed that in order to show such interference, the plaintiff did not need to prove that her tangible productivity had declined, but only that the harassment so altered her working conditions as to make it more difficult for her to do the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the objection, quoted from the transcript in Part II.C above, lacked the specificity and distinctness required by Rule 51 to preserve for appeal any issue regarding the instructions to the jury on the hostile environment claim.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the language of the objection is less explicit than a well-crafted objection should be.  Although the objection was sufficient to inform the trial court that Scarfo contended she was entitled to a \"factors\" instruction as part of the Title VII charge, it failed to proffer a correct instruction or in any other way to explain how the alleged error in the charge could be corrected.  Also, the objection failed to identify explicitly the second of the two issues stated above, and to explain how the alleged error could be corrected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo's objection thus fell short of the clarity and precision required to alert the trial judge to the contentions now advanced on appeal.  It matters not whether Scarfo had by that time formulated the contentions as they are now argued (rather than developing them through further reflection during later proceedings, either in the trial court after verdict, or on appeal).  In any event, the trial court was not alerted to the contentions now advanced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss the two related but separable issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p>B. \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo says that the court erred in its instruction to the jury that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence an abusive work environment that \"unreasonably interfered with her work performance.\"   Plaintiff argues, citing Harris, that \"unreasonable interference\" was not a separate element of the claim (failure to prove which would be fatal to the claim), but only a factor to be considered along with all other relevant factors in determining whether an abusive work environment had been proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Scarfo's favor, we accept the point that the terms \"element\" and \"factor\", as they appear in judicial opinions and commentaries, often signify a key difference between two types of legal tests prescribed by law, for use by decisionmakers (juries or judges), in determining whether the evidence in a particular case satisfies the requirements for a legal theory (of a claim or defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One type of legal test prescribes two or more \"elements\" of a claim or defense.  Each \"element\" must be satisfied.  Failure to satisfy any one among two or more \"elements\" is fatal to the claim or defense for which the legal test was prescribed by law, even if all other elements are proved beyond doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other type of legal test prescribes that two or more \"factors\" are to be weighed and evaluated in making a single \"evaluative\" determination that takes account of all of the evidence bearing on all of the \"factors.\"   Weakness of the showing of one factor, or even total failure to show it, is not fatal;  a strong showing as to other factors may outweigh the deficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the law may have been previously, Harris v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span> (1993), leaves no doubt that the legal test prescribed by Title VII, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, is, in part at least, a factors-type test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p>Whether an environment is \"hostile\" or \"abusive\" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances, which may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct;  its severity;  whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance;  and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance....  [W]hile psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 371.   Thus, that discriminatory conduct unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's work performance is not an element, proof of which is essential, but a factor to be considered in determining whether an \"abusive\" or \"hostile\" environment has been proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal test set forth in Harris is in fact neither entirely an \"elements\" test nor entirely a \"factors\" test.  Instead, the Harris test has both elements and factors within it.  First, it is comprised of several \"elements\"--each alone fatal to the claim if not satisfied.  One of these \"elements\" is that the work environment was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the test (or \"sub-test,\" one may prefer to say, to distinguish between the overall test and the internal test for one \"element\") for determining whether one of the \"elements\" has been satisfied is a \"factors\" type of test.  More specifically, one of the elements of the Harris test is proof that the environment in which the plaintiff worked was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"   And the test (or sub-test) for determining whether this \"element\" has been satisfied in a particular case is a \"factors\" test.  The passage from Harris, quoted immediately above, identifies both of these two characteristics of the legal test set forth by the Court in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reading of the Opinion for a unanimous Court is reinforced by the Concurring Opinions of both Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg.  Justice Scalia noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p>\"[o]ne of the factors mentioned in the Court's nonexhaustive list--whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance--would, if it were made an absolute test, provide greater guidance to juries and employers.  But I see no basis for such a limitation in the language of the statute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 372 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Justice Ginsburg, using the word \"dominantly\" rather than an absolute or conclusive term, also recognized that \"unreasonable interference with work performance\" was not alone decisive as to whether an abusive environment exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p>[T]he adjudicator's inquiry should center, dominantly, on whether the discriminatory conduct has unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff's work performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 372 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the trial court's instruction was incorrect in stating that \"unreasonable[e] interfere[nce] with her work performance\" was an absolute requirement for showing the existence of a hostile or abusive work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem is that plaintiff Scarfo did not properly preserve this issue for appeal because plaintiff Scarfo's statement to the trial court of the grounds of her objection was deficient in several ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it was susceptible of being interpreted as saying that the Harris test is entirely a \"factors\" test.  It did not acknowledge that the Harris test is in some respects an \"elements\" test, one element being that the work environment was hostile or abusive.  Thus, the trial judge was not alerted to why his use of the language of an \"elements\" test in the charge might be error because of the particular way he used it, even though language such as his would be proper and even essential as part of an entirely correct instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the objection did not correctly formulate the Harris \"element\" over which there was dispute and satisfaction of which must be determined by a \"factors\" test (or sub-test).  Thus, even if the trial judge understood plaintiff's contention that some aspect, at least, of the overall Harris test was a \"factors\" test (or sub-test) for deciding whether one \"element\" was satisfied, still the objection did not formulate that element clearly enough to tell the trial judge how to correct the alleged error in his instruction.  That \"element,\" as now clearly formulated on appeal, is not \"unreasonable interference with work performance.\"   It is, instead, that the work environment was hostile or abusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, objections to a trial judge's charge to the jury must be clear enough and explicit enough to tell the trial judge what the party wishes the trial judge to say in order to correct the alleged error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Linn v.

Since the plaintiff failed to make a timely objection, we will reverse or award a new trial only if we determine, based on our review of the record, that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice or \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  Lash v.

Harris, however, does not prescribe a particular instruction on what constitutes a hostile or abusive work environment.  Rather, it clearly implies that its list of factors is nonexhaustive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Harris, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 371 (\"Whether an environment is 'hostile' or 'abusive' can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances, which may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity....\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no basis for concluding now--if, indeed, Scarfo is asking us to do so--that the jury interpreted the court's instruction to mean that \"unreasonable interference\" was the only factor they were allowed to consider in determining the existence of a hostile or abusive environment.  Also, we have no basis for determining that the jury, in deciding whether the work environment was hostile or abusive, did not consider, as part of their understanding of the instruction, factors such as \"the frequency of the discriminatory conduct;  its severity;  [and] whether it is physically threatening.\"  Id.  We conclude that it is very unlikely that the jury, if it had been instructed correctly, would have returned a different verdict.

She argues that the court's instruction was erroneous because it required the jury to find that the plaintiff's work performance was inadequate and that harassing discriminatory conduct was a cause of that inadequacy.  Plaintiff asserts on appeal that she never intended to prove that the quality or quantity of her work performance declined as a result of her treatment;  the plaintiff's theory of her case was that she continued to perform well despite the sexual harassment.  Thus, she contends that the court's instruction precluded the jury from considering her theory that the discriminatory conduct adversely affected her work conditions, but not the quality of her performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Was Scarfo's objection to the trial court sufficient to alert the court to the refinement of her theory of the case that she now argues before us?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant portion of her objection stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p>And we had requested in our Jury Instruction 22 a paragraph that was not given but that comes from the recent Harris case that says that you don't have to have the unreasonable interference with the work performance.

But it is also relevant that Justice Ginsburg's explanation of the meaning of \"unreasonable interference\" was neither expressly adopted nor disavowed by the Opinion for the unanimous Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated below, we have no need to decide, and refrain from deciding, whether, had a more explicit objection been made, the trial court should have adopted Justice Ginsburg's interpretation of \"unreasonable interference with work performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that the quoted passage from Justice Ginsburg's concurrence is also the view of the Court, we conclude that plaintiff Scarfo has not met her burden of showing that an exception to the use-or-lose principle should be invoked here.  The trial court's instruction on plaintiff's sexual harassment claim did not elaborate on the phrase \"unreasonable interference with work performance.\"   That instruction did not preclude the jury from considering the theory of her case that plaintiff Scarfo now emphasizes--the theory that her working conditions had been unreasonably altered even though her performance was not affected.  Justice Ginsburg's concurrence treats the phrase \"interference with the plaintiff's work performance\" as including an alteration of the working conditions that makes it harder to do the job.  Nothing in any of the opinions in Harris suggests, as plaintiff now does on appeal, that this phrase can be interpreted to mean only a tangible decline in productivity.  In addition, the plaintiff has not shown any basis for our concluding that the particular instruction at issue in this case, either as a whole or in part, gave the jury the impression that a tangible decline in productivity was something the plaintiff was required to prove as an element of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed another way, plaintiff's argument on appeal is that the trial court should have given an instruction stating that the plaintiff can prove unreasonable interference with work performance either (1) by proving that the discriminatory conduct would cause the quality or quantity of a reasonable person's work to decline and the plaintiff's work did so decline;  or (2) by proving that a reasonable person, subjected to the harassment that she proved, would find, and the plaintiff did so find, that the harassment so altered working conditions as to make it more difficult to do the job.  If Scarfo thought that such an instruction would have been helpful to the jury's understanding of her claim, Scarfo had the right and opportunity to make such a request.  No such request was made at the critical moment prescribed by Rule 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p>D.

We have addressed that matter in Part VI.B and VI.C, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her alternative argument that the evidence compelled a verdict in her favor--although a contention \"of law\"--is plainly based on assertions about the \"sufficiency\" of the evidence.

She maintains that if this court requires every party to file a motion for new trial as a prerequisite to appeal, then even parties who prevail on all of their claims except one--and decide against appealing the minor loss--must move for a new trial in anticipation of filing a cross-appeal if the other party should appeal.

In any event, it is unconvincing.  At least where, as here, no satisfactory explanation has been advanced for appellant's failure to seek a new trial, we conclude that it is appropriate for us to take account of the fact that trial counsel had the opportunity to decide, and may in fact have decided, that the potential costs of a new trial outweighed the potential benefits.  She could have eased to some extent the burdens of such a decision at the post-trial stage, by moving for new trial only as an alternative to a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  In any event, it would plainly be inconsistent with the letter and spirit of Rule 59 to give her a second opportunity to seek a new trial now when she did not use the opportunity available to her at the time prescribed by Rule 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also considered whether the recent decision in Lebron v.

MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller argues that the court erred in refusing to instruct on nonpecuniary damages.  Cabletron responds that in fact the court did instruct on this subject.  The record reveals good reason for confusion over this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a colloquy with counsel before the closing arguments, the court stated its intention to instruct the jury on \"enhanced compensatory damages,\" and not to instruct the jury on \"nonpecuniary damages.\"   Miller's counsel objected at this point to the omission of an instruction on nonpecuniary damages, and the court expressly restated its intention not to instruct on nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's counsel, in reliance on the court's ruling, argued in his closing that the jury should award enhanced compensatory damages.  Miller's counsel did not argue to the jury that it should award nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court instructed the jury just after the closing arguments, it instructed on nonpecuniary damages, but did not instruct the jury on enhanced compensatory damages.  This was the opposite of the court's previously stated intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court's instruction in this way, Miller's counsel objected--ostensibly, to apprise the court of the fact that the court's instructions had varied from its stated intention.  Miller's counsel requested that \"the Court reverse those two consistent with what you described this morning.\"   This statement can reasonably be interpreted as a request for an instruction on enhanced compensatory damages to replace the instruction on nonpecuniary damages.  Thus, Miller's counsel's statement arguably indicated to the judge that Miller had changed his position since his original request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this colloquy, the court re-instructed the jury on the wrongful discharge claim.  This time, the court instructed the jury on enhanced compensatory damages, but did not withdraw its earlier instruction on nonpecuniary damages, or in any other way mention nonpecuniary damages.  No further objection was made by Miller's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear from the record whether the second instruction was intended to substitute for the first instruction, or was intended as an additional instruction.  The latter interpretation is supported by the form of the verdict, in which the jury was instructed to answer special questions, including the damages questions referred to below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded Miller $995,000 in damages on the wrongful discharge claim, but awarded no \"enhanced compensatory damages.\"   See Jury Verdict, Questions 4 and 5.  Although no question on the verdict form specifically addressed \"nonpecuniary damages,\" Question 4, which refers to damages generally, may reasonably have been construed by the jury to include both pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, the instructions and the verdict form did not preclude the jury from considering an award of nonpecuniary damages in accordance with the original instruction, and the jury's award of $995,000 may have included such an award.  Thus, the verdict form together with the instructions does not conclusively demonstrate that, as plaintiff Miller urges, the jury was not instructed on the issue of nonpecuniary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to conclude that the jury was not instructed on nonpecuniary damages, counsel's failure to object, after the \"substitute\" instruction was given, is an obstacle in the way of Miller's asserting error with respect to this instruction on appeal.  Moreover, Miller's counsel's apparent reversal of his position--although arguably intended merely to apprise the court of its inconsistency--weighs against allowing Miller to assert his original position on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these obstacles is another.  Although plaintiff argues that the availability of nonpecuniary damages in a wrongful discharge action is an open question, defendant Cabletron argues that nonpecuniary damages are not available under New Hampshire state law in a wrongful termination case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Monge v.

Appellants argue that we should do so either on the ground that New Hampshire would not permit a common law claim for wrongful discharge or on the ground that the district court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also ask that we set aside the damages award and remand the case for a new trial with appropriate guidance to the district court on the scope of damages.  This is in effect a reiteration of the argument that the jury should have been instructed under New Hampshire statutory law rather than common law because, as appellants concede, the principal difference between the two--at least in the context of this case--is in the scope of the remedies available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, appellants ask that this court certify the determinative question of state common law to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that this claim should never have been submitted to the jury because New Hampshire's human rights laws, see N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 354-A, provides the exclusive remedy for a claim of retaliatory discharge based on sex discrimination.  Appellee Miller responds that appellants did not properly preserve the issue for appeal and that, in any event, the cited statute does not provide an exclusive remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants acknowledge that they never objected to the court's instruction to the jury on the question of damages.  The first time appellants gave the trial judge notice of the argument now advanced on appeal was in a post-judgment motion seeking various forms of relief, including vacatur of judgment and a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that they raised the issue of statutory exclusion of common law remedies for gender discrimination in a motion for summary judgment.  Appellants, however, did not \"squarely and distinctly,\" see Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504001\"><a href=\"/opinion/504001/martin-rivera-gomez-v-rafael-adolfo-de-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 635 (1st Cir.1988), raise on the merits in their motion for summary judgment the issue of the exclusion by statute of a common law wrongful termination remedy for gender discrimination.  Moreover, even if we were to hold that they had done so, still, in seeking relief from this court they face the obstacle that they failed to move on this ground, under Rule 50, for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.  In view of this failure to bring the matter to the attention of the trial court after the close of the evidence at trial, their claim of error on this ground is not available for review under a standard as favorable to appellants as the harmless error standard.  See Eastern Mount.  Platform Tennis v. Sherwin Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682731\"><a href=\"/opinion/682731/eastern-mountain-platform-tennis-inc-v-the-sherwin-williams-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 497 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the damages award for Miller's state law claim was based on a legal premise that may not be the way this New Hampshire substantive-law issue is eventually resolved, at some future time, it does not follow that the judgment based upon that legal premise was a miscarriage of justice.  The only prejudice that appellants purport to show was an award of damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish that, they argue, is precluded by the absence of nonpecuniary damages from the statutory specification of exclusive remedies.  Even were we to accept this assertion, and hence conclude that plaintiffs were not legally entitled to damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish, the point remains that the record contains evidence of other elements of damages--evidence more compelling than any evidence of pain, suffering, and anguish.  Nor is there any showing that pain, suffering, and anguish were emphasized by Miller in presenting his claims to the jury.  Finally, there is some doubt, as explained above, see Part VII, whether the jury could be expected to understand the charge as instructing that they could award damages for pain and suffering.  At best, the suggestion of prejudice is quite speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we do not consider on the merits appellants' argument for vacating that part of the judgment making an award to Miller on his claim for wrongful termination under state common law.  Nor do we give further consideration to certifying a question to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire when appellants are procedurally barred from raising on the merits the very issue on which they seek certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not consider whether we should vacate this part of the judgment on the ground that the district court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.

DEFENDANT BENSON'S APPEAL OF THE TITLE VII CLAIMS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Benson asks this court to vacate the Title VII liability findings against him in favor of both Scarfo and Miller and to determine that the district court should have dismissed the Title VII claim against him because, as a matter of law, an individual cannot be liable under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benson squarely raised this issue in a motion for summary judgment filed against plaintiff Miller.  Appellant Benson concedes that he did not seek summary judgment against the other plaintiff, Scarfo, on this ground.  He contends, though, that the district judge's later consolidation of plaintiffs' cases and express order that the defendants' motion for summary judgment in the Miller case be transferred to the main case and considered re-filed in that case, rendered the summary judgment motion applicable to plaintiff Scarfo.  We decline to accept this contention.  To accept it would imply that it would be appropriate to enter summary judgment against a party who never had explicit notice that her opponent had moved for summary judgment against her.  Therefore, we consider Benson's contentions only as they apply to his appeal of the judgment against him for his retaliatory firing of Miller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial court denied Benson's motion for summary judgment as to Miller's claim of individual Title VII liability, Benson did not raise the issue again in the trial court on a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Thus, the claim of error by the trial court in concluding, as a basis for denying summary judgment, that Miller may be held individually liable is not available for review under a standard as favorable to appellants as the harmless error standard.  See Eastern Mount.  Platform Tennis, 40 F.3d at 497.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction on Benson's individual liability under Title VII may or may not have been erroneous.  The trial judge made clear that on this point he was adopting the view of a district court of this circuit, and arguably the view of some circuits, over the plainly contrary view of other circuits.

PLAINTIFF SCARFO'S PRINCIPAL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Components of Scarfo's Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Scarfo was awarded damages on two of her claims:  the Title VII sex discrimination claim and the Equal Pay Act claim.  We discuss each of these awards in turn.  To aid the reader in understanding the damages analysis, we note that the following dates are relevant to Plaintiff Scarfo's damages.  Plaintiff Scarfo was terminated on January 10, 1991.  Plaintiff Scarfo filed a claim with the EEOC on March 6, 1991 and filed this civil action with the court below on October 8, 1991.  The first of the Orders that, together, constitute the final judgment in this case was entered on May 10, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Title VII Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages awarded to plaintiff Scarfo by the trial court for her successful Title VII claim consist of three types:  back pay, front pay, and damages for the value of stock options that plaintiff did not receive as a result of the discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded plaintiff Scarfo $1,187,901.07 in damages for the Title VII violation (consisting of the sum of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock, reduced by the jury's award of $28,000 under the Equal Pay Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term back pay refers to lost wages commencing on the date two years before the plaintiff's filing with the EEOC to the date of judgment.  Front pay refers to damages for wages from the date of judgment to some specified date in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The back pay and front pay damages awarded by the trial court are to some extent overlapping and must be modified for reasons explained in Part XI.C below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Equal Pay Act Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded plaintiff Scarfo $28,000 in damages for defendant Cabletron's violation of the Equal Pay Act.  The trial court instructed the jury that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p>Under the Equal Pay Act, Ms. Scarfo's award of unpaid wages is limited to a period of two years prior to filing this lawsuit and extending until her termination unless she proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was willful.  If you find that Cabletron acted willfully, then Ms. Scarfo may recover unpaid wages for a period of three years prior to filing this lawsuit and extending until her termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p>Cf. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no need to decide, and thus refrain from deciding, whether this instruction on the law was accurate because neither party objected to the instruction at trial and neither has raised the issue before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special verdict form does not indicate whether the jury found that the defendant's violation was willful.  Thus, assuming, as we must, that the jury followed the court's instructions, the jury's award represents the damages for the time span from October 8 of either 1988 or 1989 up to January 10 of 1991, when plaintiff Scarfo was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither plaintiff Scarfo nor defendant Cabletron challenges the jury's award under the Equal Pay Act of $28,000.  There is a lack of clarity in the briefs and record, however, about whether this recovery is in addition to the recovery for violation of Title VII.  We discuss this issue in Parts XI.A.3 and XI.E below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Combining to a Nonduplicative Total</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The award under Title VII is to some extent duplicative of the award under the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently to avoid a duplicate recovery, the trial court subtracted the jury's award of $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation committed by Cabletron from the court's total calculation of $1,215,901.07 (consisting of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock options) in damages for the Title VII violation committed by Cabletron and Benson, resulting in what the court determined was the total Title VII award of $1,187,901.07 against Benson and Cabletron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, under the final judgment entered in the case by the court below, defendants Cabletron and Benson were held jointly and severally liable for $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII violation and Cabletron was held liable for an additional $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.  Since Benson was not liable under the Equal Pay Act, there is a problem about subtracting $28,000 from the award against Benson to avoid duplicative recovery.  We address this problem in Part XI.E below, along with the need for other modifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants Cabletron and Benson raise arguments with respect to all three components of Scarfo's Title VII award.  We discuss each component in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the court awarded Scarfo back pay for the Title VII claim in the amount of $242,407.07 (before reduction by $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act award).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII permits an award of back pay starting two years before the date of the filing of plaintiff's complaint with the EEOC (two years before March 6, 1991) up until the date of judgment.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000-5(g).  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo is entitled to back pay from March 6, 1989 to May 10, 1994.  From March 6, 1989 to the date of her termination, January 10, 1991, the damages represent the amount that she was underpaid because of discrimination on the basis of her sex.  From January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994, damages represent the amount she should have been paid, if she had not been terminated on the basis of her sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court performed a detailed set of calculations based on evidence admitted at trial and awarded Scarfo $242,407.07 in back pay (before reduction to avoid duplication).  See Addendum to Court's Order of May 9, 1994.  These calculations separate the time period for back pay into the relevant sub-periods and use the salary rate of an arguably equivalent male employee (as a proxy for what plaintiff Scarfo would have earned in the absence of discrimination) to calculate the damages for each day of each sub-period.  Although defendants raise several arguments with respect to these calculations, we determine that the court's findings of fact are not \"clearly erroneous\" and the method of performing the calculations was in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In particular, the defendants criticize the trial court's use of the salaries of two other Cabletron employees, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Jacob, in the calculations.  Defendants argue that the trial court erred in comparing plaintiff Scarfo to these two employees because these two employees had greater responsibilities at Cabletron.  This argument fails because the trial court reasonably could have determined that Scarfo either had a similar level of responsibility or would have been given similar responsibilities but for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court calculated damages up until May 4, 1994, only, instead of May 10, 1994.  No party, however, has raised any issue on appeal regarding this period of approximately one week, and we do not disturb the trial court's calculations in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Scarfo's Front Pay Award</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded Scarfo $744,744 as front pay.

In light of the evidence that she had only a ten percent chance of returning to full employment at an equivalent salary, the court's finding that Scarfo will be unable to find professional employment in the future is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the \"court imported the erroneous concept of displaced worker into the case.\"   The court did not explain the meaning of \"displaced worker,\" nor has our attention been called to any published opinion that uses this terminology in the Title VII context.  In any event, regardless of the terminology used, plaintiff Scarfo's ability to find similar employment in the future is relevant both to the trial court's decision to award front pay and to the calculation of such an award.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding front pay to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calculating Scarfo's front pay award, the court adopted the calculations of plaintiff's expert witness.  Defendants do not dispute that these calculations were admissible and were adequately explained by the expert's report and testimony;  rather, they now question merely the weight the court gave to this evidence by pointing out concessions made by the expert during the cross-examination.  The defendants' contentions fail because the choice by the court, as factfinder for the purpose of calculating damages, to give probative weight to the expert's calculations was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In another respect, however, we conclude that the court erred in adopting and using the expert's calculations as a measure of front pay.  The expert's calculation of damages in the amount of $973,494, which the court adopted for Scarfo's front pay award, was for a period commencing on January 1, 1991.  As stated above, \"front pay\" usually refers to an award for future salary payments starting on the date of the judgment, in this case, May 10, 1994.  Since the court, in addition to its front pay award, also awarded back pay for the time period up until the date of the verdict on May 4, 1994, plaintiff Scarfo obtained duplicate damages for the period from January 1, 1991 to May 4, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he law abhors duplicative recoveries.  That is to say, a plaintiff who is injured by reason of a defendant's behavior is, for the most part, entitled to be made whole--not to be enriched.\"  Dopp v. HTP Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570480\"><a href=\"/opinion/570480/paul-s-dopp-v-htp-corporation-paul-s-dopp-v-htp-corporation-paul-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 516 (1st Cir.1991).  The court adopted the expert's calculations for the front pay award and performed its own calculations to determine the back pay award.  Thus, the amounts of the front pay and back pay awards representing the period from January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 are different because the expert and the court employed different methods to calculate damages.  To avoid duplicative recovery, plaintiff Scarfo's combined total of Title VII damages should be reduced either by the amount the court awarded as back pay for the period from January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994, or by the amount the court ordered as front pay for that same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For two reasons we choose the latter method of determining the measure of the duplication that must be avoided.  First, unlike the court's calculations for that period, the expert's calculations include social security contributions and fringe benefits.  Therefore, the amount derived from the expert's calculations is a larger amount than the amount calculated by the court for that period.  Thus, it is more consistent with our goal of modification only as needed to avoid duplicative recovery to decrease the total award by the smaller amount, that is the amount the court calculated for back pay for that period.  Second, since the expert's calculations were computed on an annual basis and the court's calculations were computed on a daily basis, using the back pay measure calculated by the court for the period from January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994 makes for an easier and more precise calculation of the duplication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the trial court calculated plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07 (before adjustment for the Equal Pay Act award) consisting of $242,407.07 in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for the value of stock options.  The portion of the court's back pay award attributable to the period for January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 is $224,013.12.  Thus, to avoid duplication, we reduce the court's calculation of Title VII damages by $224,013.12, resulting in a back pay award of $18,393.95 ($242,407.07 less $224,013.12), and a total sum of Title VII damages (before adjustment with respect to Cabletron for the Equal Pay Act award) of $991,887.95, consisting of $18,393.95 for the period up to January 10, 1991, $744,744 for the period commencing January 10, 1991, and $228,750 for the value of stock options.  Both defendants Cabletron and Benson are jointly and severally liable for this amount.  This amount does not include the adjustment (discussed below in Part XI.E) for the jury's Equal Pay Act award against Cabletron only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded damages to plaintiff Scarfo for the value of stock options she would have received if she had not been discriminated against on the basis of sex.  The court found that Scarfo would have been given options to purchase 2500 shares of stock at a purchase price of $15.50.  The court found that the value of the stock was $107.00 per share around the time of the trial and awarded Scarfo $228,750 in damages ($107.00 minus $15.50 times 2,500).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants raise only one argument with respect to this damages award;  they say that Scarfo is barred from recovering these damages on the basis of res judicata.  Before filing the civil action in federal court, Scarfo filed an action with the New Hampshire Department of Labor.  In that action, the plaintiff sought to recover compensation under N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51 (authorizing the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Labor to hold hearings to enforce the provisions of certain New Hampshire labor laws).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Labor determined, inter alia, that stock options were not \"compensation\" and thus not recoverable under N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her amended complaint to the trial court below, Scarfo sought to recover lost wages and stock options on a breach of contract theory.  The district judge dismissed the breach of contract claim on the basis of res judicata because it stated the same cause of action the plaintiff had already adjudicated under N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 275:51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert that because the plaintiff was barred from recovering damages for stock options under a breach of contract theory, the plaintiff should be barred from recovering damages for stock options under a Title VII sex discrimination theory.  This argument lacks merit.  Under defendants' reasoning, the plaintiff would be barred from recovering any type of lost compensation (including wages) under Title VII, because she had adjudicated a breach of contract claim for lost wages and other compensation in the Department of Labor proceedings.  But res judicata bars causes of action, not types of damages recoverable under some other claim not subject to adjudication in the tribunal rendering the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See In re Alfred P., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></span>, 629, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1264</span></span> (1985) (\"The doctrine of res judicata precludes the litigation in a later case of matters actually litigated, and matters that could have been litigated, in an earlier action between the same parties for the same cause of action.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's Title VII cause of action is not the same cause of action as her breach of contract action;  it requires different elements to be proved.  These different elements were not tried, and could not have been tried, in the New Hampshire Department of Labor hearings.  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII claim is not barred by res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the defendants raise no other arguments with respect to the trial court's award of $228,750 for the value of stock options not received by plaintiff Scarfo, we do not disturb the trial court's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p>E. Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described above, the trial court originally calculated Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07.  Then, recognizing the need to avoid duplicative recovery, the court subtracted $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act claim.  Thus, under the final judgment entered by the court (as gleaned from the collection of Orders referred to in Part II, supra ) Cabletron was held liable for $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII violation and $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court erred in subtracting the Equal Pay Act award from the back pay component of the court's Title VII award.  We agree that the method used by the trial court to avoid duplicate recoveries was at best confusing, if not erroneous, for two reasons.  First, the back pay component of the Title VII damages award and the jury's Equal Pay Act award represent damages for different time periods.  Second, only defendant Cabletron (and not defendant Benson) is liable under the Equal Pay Act.  Thus, we make the following additional adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Part XI.C above, our modification of the total Title VII damages resulted in a calculation of Title VII damages in the amount of $991,887.95.  The remaining question before us is how appropriately to modify this award to avoid duplicative recovery by plaintiff Scarfo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The portion of our modified Title VII damages calculation representing damages from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 is $18,393.95.  The jury's Equal Pay Act award of $28,000 represents damages for the same injury, namely discrimination in pay on the basis of sex, for a period commencing either October 8, 1988 or October 8, 1989 and extending to January 10, 1991, the date of her termination.  Thus, regardless of whether the jury found willfulness, these time periods overlap to some extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider separately the two cases (the two different periods, and as a result the two different methods of calculation to avoid an overlap).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the jury found wilfulness, the EPA award of $28,000 represents the period from October 8, 1988 to January 10, 1991.  This time period is longer than, and includes entirely the time period of March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991, for which damages were calculated at $18,393.95.  Thus, if the jury found wilfulness, the appropriate way to avoid duplicative recovery is to reduce the Equal Pay Act award by $18,393.95, so that Cabletron is liable to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95 for the Title VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p260\">\n      <span class=\"num\">260</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the jury did not find wilfulness, the Equal Pay Act award of $28,000 represents the period from October 8, 1989 to January 10, 1991.  This is a shorter time period than the time period from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 for which the judge awarded $18,393.95.  If we could determine that the jury did not find wilfulness, the more accurate adjustment we could make to avoid duplicative recovery would be to reduce the Equal Pay Act award by $12,367.55, the amount of the Title VII award representing damages from October 8, 1989 to January 1, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p261\">\n      <span class=\"num\">261</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we cannot determine whether the jury found wilfulness, we conclude that it is appropriate in these circumstances to accept the reduction of $18,393.95 as an appropriate adjustment to avoid overlap (instead of the reduction of $12,367.55).  If, in fact, the jury's award was not based on a finding of wilfulness and accordingly the appropriate adjustment is a reduction of $12,367.55, then the prejudice to plaintiff Scarfo is quite small (i.e., $6,026.40) in comparison either with her total recovery or with the cost to her, as well as to opposing parties and the public, of a remand for a new trial on the sole issue of whether Cabletron's Equal Pay Act violation was wilful.  Having failed to request an explicit jury finding as to wilfulness, Scarfo is in no position to complain of this resolution of the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p262\">\n      <span class=\"num\">262</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, after the reduction of $18,393.95 to avoid overlap, Cabletron is liable to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95 for the Title VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p263\">\n      <span class=\"num\">263</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Equal Pay Act claim was not brought against defendant Benson, Benson is liable only for Title VII damages.  In accordance with the explanation above, Benson is jointly and severally liable to Scarfo for Title VII damage totalling $991,887.95 consisting of $18,393.95 for the period before January 10, 1991;  $744,744 for the period after January 10, 1991;  and $228,750 in stock options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p264\">\n      <span class=\"num\">264</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that these adjusted calculations are not intended to alter the usual terminology and relevant time periods for damages under Title VII.  As explained above, a successful plaintiff (one who has proved liability under Title VII) is entitled to back pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date two years before the plaintiff's EEOC filing and continuing until the date of judgment.  A court, in its discretion, may also award front pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date of judgment and continuing to some specified date in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XII. PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p265\">\n      <span class=\"num\">265</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found defendants Cabletron and Benson liable to plaintiff Miller under Title VII for retaliatory discharge.  The court awarded plaintiff Miller $190,651.85 in back pay representing lost compensation from the date of his discharge to the date of judgment.  The court awarded Miller $995,000 in front pay purportedly representing lost compensation from the date of judgment forward.  The court also awarded Miller $206,060 for the value of stock options that he did not receive because of his discharge.  These three calculations total $1,391,711.85 in damages for the Title VII violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p266\">\n      <span class=\"num\">266</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants raise no arguments with respect to the court's back pay award of $190,651.85.  We discuss, in turn, the defendants arguments with respect to the front pay damages and the damages for the value of the stock options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Miller's Damages for Front Pay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p267\">\n      <span class=\"num\">267</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court's method of calculating damages for front pay was an abuse of discretion.  The jury awarded plaintiff Miller $995,000 in damages for Miller's wrongful discharge claim under New Hampshire state law.  The court, for a reason not stated, assumed that this sum represented damages for front pay only.  Thus, the court incorporated this sum of $995,000 into the court's calculations of Title VII damages as the damages for front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, we review a court's decision to award front pay damages under the abuse-of-discretion standard.  We conclude that the defendants are correct in asserting that the court's decision to use the jury's figure of $995,000 for front pay damages was an abuse of discretion because the jury's award may have included some back pay, some amount for the value of the stock options, and some amount as damages for pain and suffering.  Plaintiff Miller, in a post-trial motion and in his brief as appellee, agrees that the court erred in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p269\">\n      <span class=\"num\">269</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was instructed that if it found Cabletron liable on the state law wrongful termination claim, it must consider two types of damages:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p270\">\n      <span class=\"num\">270</span>\n      <p>First, you must determine the amount of wages and fringe benefits he would have earned through employment with defendant Cabletron ... if he had not been discharged on May 30th, 1990, to the date of your verdict.  Second, you must determine the amount of future wages and fringe benefits he reasonably would have earned in his employment with Cabletron if he had not been discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction clearly permits the jury to award both back-pay damages and front-pay damages.  The verdict form did not require the jury to report the two separately.  The $995,000 awarded by the jury is reasonably interpreted as an award for both back pay and front pay.  As explained above, the $995,000 may have included, also, damages for pain and suffering.  Thus, the court erred in using the jury's award on the state law wrongful termination claim as the measure of front pay damages under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p272\">\n      <span class=\"num\">272</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, plaintiff Miller's expert testified that $211,000 was the appropriate award for front-pay damages.  Plaintiff Miller has asked this court, in correcting for this error, to reduce the award for front-pay damages from $995,000 to $211,000, the amount calculated by plaintiff Miller's expert.  Defendants Cabletron and Benson argue that this court should vacate the entire award for front pay because the trial court abused its discretion in deciding to make any award for front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below found that Miller did make reasonable efforts to procure employment, but that the courier business he began in 1991 has not yet made a profit.  We will not disturb this finding of fact because the defendants have not shown it to be clearly erroneous.  From this finding, we infer that the court also found that it was impracticable for Miller to return to Cabletron and that Miller had made reasonable efforts to find a job with the same earning capacity.  Miller is thus entitled to damages for front pay.  The court's determination that Miller was entitled to an award of front pay was not an abuse of discretion, and we will not disturb that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p274\">\n      <span class=\"num\">274</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's proposal to this court that the award be reduced from $995,000 to $211,000--if the proposal had been made to and accepted by the trial court--has evidentiary support in the testimony of plaintiff's expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p275\">\n      <span class=\"num\">275</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has authority to modify a damages award when all the necessary factfindings have been made in the court below.  Cf. Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 943 (modifying an award of fair and reasonable attorneys' fees when the trial court made a legal error with respect to the method of calculation).  Reducing the award to $211,000, however, as plaintiff Miller requests, would require this court to evaluate the credibility of the plaintiff's expert and to make a new finding of fact, not made in the trial court, that Miller is entitled to $211,000 in damages for front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p276\">\n      <span class=\"num\">276</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we do not have the authority to make findings of fact in order to modify the award in the manner requested by plaintiff, we vacate the front pay award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p277\">\n      <span class=\"num\">277</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate amount for the front pay award.  The district court, on remand, may allow the interested parties a reasonable time period within which to file with the district court a stipulation resolving this issue (for example, a stipulation such as Miller's proposal to this court that his award for front pay be reduced to $211,000 and judgment be entered accordingly).  If no such agreement is filed, the trial court is to determine the amount of the award to Miller for front pay.  The trial court may find it appropriate to act on the present record of evidence and adopt the plaintiff's calculation of $211,000 for front pay.  It may instead calculate front pay damages from the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) forward in some other manner supported by the present record of evidence.  Also, the court, in its discretion and for cause shown, may receive additional evidence bearing upon this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p278\">\n      <span class=\"num\">278</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his employment, plaintiff Miller was told that, over a specific period of time, he would be given stock options that would allow him to purchase 10,000 shares of stock at a purchase price of $3.97 per share.  During his employment, he received options to purchase only 2,000 shares.  During the time period from the date of his termination (April 20, 1990) to the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) Miller alleges that he would have received options to purchase 5,000 shares.  Miller also alleges that within a month of the date of judgment, his right to options with respect to the remaining 3,000 shares would have vested.  Thus, Miller's counsel argued to the trial court that Miller should have been awarded damages for the value of options for 8,000 shares of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p279\">\n      <span class=\"num\">279</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court awarded plaintiff Miller $206,060 in damages for the value of 2,000 shares of stock.  The court did not explain how it determined the number 2,000 to be the number of shares of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p280\">\n      <span class=\"num\">280</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-appellants, in their brief on appeal, do not dispute the facts, as alleged by plaintiff Miller, regarding the options for 10,000 shares.  In an effort to point out all potential errors made by the district court in support of their argument that this court should vacate both awards entirely, they argue that the trial court erred in deciding to award Miller the value of 2,000 stock options.  Defendants suggest that the trial court mistakenly thought that Miller had already received stock options for 8,000 of the 10,000 shares, when, in fact, this was the amount he had not received because of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p281\">\n      <span class=\"num\">281</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The brief of appellee Miller agrees that the court erred, and suggests (adopting defendants' reasoning in part) that the court should have awarded $824,240, the value of stock options for 8,000 shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p282\">\n      <span class=\"num\">282</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The implications of defendants' argument on appeal are troubling.  They have requested, in the event that this court does not reverse the liability determination on Miller's Title VII claim, that this court set aside Miller's entire damages award and remand.  If the remand were limited to trial of the issue of damages for the value of stock, however, the trial court might award either the value of 5,000 shares of stock (the amount vesting before the date of judgment), or the value of 8,000 shares of stock.  In either case, the probable consequence of retrying only this issue would be an additional liability, beyond that already awarded by the trial court, of either $309,090 or $618,180 in favor of plaintiff Miller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p283\">\n      <span class=\"num\">283</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's brief as appellee requests that this court award damages for the value of stock options for 8,000 shares.  Defendants respond that we should not grant this request (which would increase the total damages award) because plaintiff Miller did not appeal the award of damages in his cross-appeal;  rather, plaintiff Miller raised this argument only in its appellee brief responding to the defendants' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p284\">\n      <span class=\"num\">284</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refrain from modifying the judgment to award the value of 8,000 stock options because to do so would require this court to make new findings of fact.  We also refrain from remanding this issue to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining an appropriate award for the value of lost stock options because neither party has requested that we do so.  Both parties have requested that this court take actions that are beyond this court's authority.  Since neither party's position has merit, we simply affirm the trial court's award of $206,060 for the value of stock options for 2,000 shares of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XIII. PREJUDGMENT INTEREST</p>\n    <p>A. The Arguments of the Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p285\">\n      <span class=\"num\">285</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some confusion both in the record and in the parties' briefs about whether the court awarded prejudgment interest on any part of Scarfo's damages award and whether prejudgment interest, if awarded, was appropriate.  Defendants argue that the court awarded prejudgment interest on Scarfo's Title VII award, and that this was error.  Plaintiff Scarfo argues that the trial court refused to award prejudgment interest on Scarfo's Title VII award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p286\">\n      <span class=\"num\">286</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from a review of the record that the trial court denied prejudgment interest on every element of the award to plaintiff Scarfo.  In answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury answered \"NO,\" finding against Scarfo on her prejudgment interest claim.  By its Order of July 20, 1994, the court stated as to all of Scarfo's claims, \"Prejudgment interest is disallowed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p287\">\n      <span class=\"num\">287</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the judgment for plaintiff Miller, the defendants have not raised on appeal any objection to the trial court's award of prejudgment interest on Miller's state law wrongful termination claim at the rate of 10% per annum, as mandated by N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 524:1-b and Sec. 336:1.  With respect to Miller's Title VII award, however, there is some confusion in the parties' briefs about whether the parties understood that the court awarded prejudgment interest on any part of the award.  The parties' briefs assume that prejudgment interest was awarded on the entire Title VII award.  From this premise, the parties dispute whether it was appropriate for the court to award prejudgment interest on the front pay award and the portion of the back pay award representing damages for the period from the date Miller's complaint was filed to the date of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p288\">\n      <span class=\"num\">288</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from a review of the record that the trial court allowed prejudgment interest on Miller's state law claim for wrongful termination, but not on any aspect of his Title VII claim.  In its answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury answered \"NO,\" thus finding against Miller on his claim for prejudgment interest.  But in his Order of July 19, 1994, the trial judge \"abrogate[d]\" that finding insofar as it applied to the state law claim for wrongful termination and awarded Miller prejudgment interest from the date of filing of the complaint to the date of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p289\">\n      <span class=\"num\">289</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since, contrary to the contentions of the parties, we have concluded that the trial court did not award prejudgment interest on plaintiff Scarfo's and plaintiff Miller's Title VII awards, the only question remaining is whether the trial court erred by denying prejudgment interest on all aspects of the plaintiffs' Title VII awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p290\">\n      <span class=\"num\">290</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court has discretion whether to award prejudgment interest on a successful Title VII claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p291\">\n      <span class=\"num\">291</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Earnhardt v.

Thus, as stated below in the Conclusion, we affirm the trial court's decision not to award prejudgment interest on both plaintiffs' Title VII claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Front Pay Awards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p293\">\n      <span class=\"num\">293</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For an additional reason, we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the front pay components of both plaintiffs' Title VII damages awards.  Interest is ordinarily awarded to compensate for the lost use of funds.  Since the front pay awards represent damages for wages the plaintiffs would have received in the future, after the date of judgment, the plaintiffs had not lost use of these funds before the judgment was ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p294\">\n      <span class=\"num\">294</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cf.

Awards for the Value of Stock Options</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p297\">\n      <span class=\"num\">297</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, defendants argue that prejudgment interest should not be awarded on the value of the stock options, since the amount of damages was based on the price of the stock on or near the date of judgment.  If the plaintiffs had received the stock options at the time due and had not transferred them, the plaintiffs would have been in possession of shares of stock having the value equal to the purchase price plus the amount of damages.  Thus, the damages awards for the stock options already represent the present value of the stock options at the date of judgment.  We conclude that an award of prejudgment interest is not necessary to compensate the plaintiffs.  Although a reasonable argument may be made that prejudgment interest is an appropriate remedy for the loss of dividends that would have been paid to plaintiffs if they had been in possession of the stock during the period to which they were entitled to it, neither party has argued this proposition.  Since both plaintiffs have conceded either explicitly (in Miller's case) or implicitly (in Scarfo's case, to the extent she argues that prejudgment interest was not even awarded) that prejudgment interest on the value of the stock options is not appropriate, we refrain from addressing the argument that prejudgment interest may be awarded as compensation for lost dividends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p298\">\n      <span class=\"num\">298</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, defendants and plaintiffs agree that prejudgment interest was inappropriate on the damages for stock options and we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the stock options components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XIV. MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p299\">\n      <span class=\"num\">299</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The orders of the district court that we have determined to be the functional equivalent of a final judgment are silent, and thus perhaps ambiguous, with respect to the effect of the overlap between the judgment for plaintiff Miller on the jury finding of damages in the state law wrongful termination claim and the judgment for plaintiff Miller in the court's findings of damages in the Title VII claim.  Separate awards were made for these two claims, but nothing is stated explicitly about whether and to what extent, and with what effect on collectibility, the elements of harm for which damages are awarded under the two claims overlap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p300\">\n      <span class=\"num\">300</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the parties brought this matter to the attention of the trial court.  Each party may have been reluctant to do so for fear the ambiguity would then be resolved against it.  Having chosen instead to argue their respective positions only on appeal, however, no party is in a favorable position to seek an award of costs of appeal.  We award no costs of appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of the district court with respect to Miller's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p301\">\n      <span class=\"num\">301</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To eliminate any uncertainty, we state our determination of the meaning of the judgment, with the modifications we order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p302\">\n      <span class=\"num\">302</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Miller prevailed on two claims:  his state law claim for wrongful discharge against Cabletron (and not Benson) and his federal Title VII claim for retaliatory discharge against Cabletron and Benson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p303\">\n      <span class=\"num\">303</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Miller was awarded $995,000 with prejudgment interest at a rate of 10% per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint to the date of the verdict (May 4, 1994) on his New Hampshire state law claim for wrongful termination against Cabletron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p304\">\n      <span class=\"num\">304</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After modification by this court, plaintiff Miller is entitled to three types of damages for his Title VII claim against Cabletron and Benson.  First, Miller is entitled to back pay in the amount of $190,651.85 (without prejudgment interest).  Second, Miller is entitled to damages for front pay (without prejudgment interest).  As stated in Part XII.A supra, the trial court will determine, after proceedings on remand, whether to award $211,000 or some different amount as the front pay award.  Third, Miller is entitled to damages (without prejudgment interest) for the value of lost stock options in the amount of $206,060.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p305\">\n      <span class=\"num\">305</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since defendant Benson is liable on the Title VII claim (and not the state law claim), Cabletron and Benson are jointly and severally liable for the total amount of the Title VII damages only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p306\">\n      <span class=\"num\">306</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although defendant Cabletron was found liable on both the state law and federal law claims, plaintiff Miller is not entitled to collect on both claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p307\">\n      <span class=\"num\">307</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Freeman v.

She did not prevail on her claim of sexual harassment against Benson or Cabletron.  Her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Cabletron was dismissed, and she lost on the same claim against Benson at trial.  Her claim of breach of contract was dismissed on the ground of res judicata.  The defamation claim was not pressed at trial, apparently because it was settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p313\">\n      <span class=\"num\">313</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller prevailed against Cabletron and Benson on his Title VII claim for retaliatory discharge, and against Cabletron on his state-law wrongful termination claim.  Although he lost none of his claims that went to the jury (except for prejudgment interest), Miller's claims for abuse of process and intentional infliction of emotional distress were apparently dismissed before or during trial, although on the record before us we cannot tell under what circumstances or on what terms they were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p314\">\n      <span class=\"num\">314</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following trial, the court received briefs and held a hearing to determine attorneys' fees.  The court awarded fees to Scarfo in the amounts of $225,300.13 for services of the firm that handled the bulk of her case and $18,955 for the services of a firm that handled a small part of the case.  The court awarded fees to Miller in the amount of $117,510.97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p315\">\n      <span class=\"num\">315</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the trial court improperly awarded Miller fees related to claims on which he did not prevail at trial--apparently, the dismissed claims of abuse of process and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Yet appellants have failed to provide this court with a record from which we could determine whether the award included the cost of prosecuting these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p316\">\n      <span class=\"num\">316</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the trial court's order awarding attorneys' fees to Miller that the court had before it a detailed bill for Miller's attorneys' services.  Appellants have not made that bill, or any other information sufficient to support a reasoned decision by this court, a part of the record.  This court therefore has no basis for determining whether there is any truth to appellants' assertion that the fee award against them included the cost of litigating claims on which Miller did not prevail at trial.  In these circumstances, we do not reach the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in its award of fees for the simple reason that we have no basis for a reasoned decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p317\">\n      <span class=\"num\">317</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an appellant fails to provide a record of evidence material to the point the appellant wishes to raise, and thus leaves the appellate court with an insufficient basis to make a reasoned decision, the court in its discretion may either consider the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal if the absence of a full record thwarts intelligent and reasoned review.  See Moore, 47 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p318\">\n      <span class=\"num\">318</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the district court did not reduce the award to Scarfo to account for her unsuccessful claims.  The support for this assertion consists primarily of a listing of the claims on which plaintiffs did not prevail.  Appellants cite a statement of the trial court in a related case in which the court acknowledged that the Title VII and state-law claims involved different defenses and varying remedies, as well as novel issues of state law.  Appellants also assert that plaintiffs \"failed to establish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly failed to explain many of the general entries which were made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p319\">\n      <span class=\"num\">319</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Scarfo's lead counsel regarding Scarfo's counsel fees.  Counsel testified that the proffered itemized bill did not include work relating to the defamation claim, or work solely related to the harassment claim or the emotional distress claim.  She also testified that the fees for which her client sought reimbursement were $75,000 less than the total fees charged.  Counsel was subjected to fairly detailed cross-examination, especially regarding the fees attributable to the sexual harassment claim;  cross-examination on that topic focused especially on fees for research undertaken on February 2 and February 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p320\">\n      <span class=\"num\">320</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that on these two dates, February 2 and 5, 1993, research was undertaken on issues on which plaintiff did not prevail, but that \"the issues are interwoven.\"   The court stated that it was reducing the charges allowed for those two days by 50% to $427.50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p321\">\n      <span class=\"num\">321</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An award of fees under Title VII is reviewed primarily under an abuse of discretion standard, and the trial court's range of discretion is particularly broad.

Larkin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445233\"><a href=\"/opinion/445233/grendels-den-inc-v-john-p-larkin-cambridge-license-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p329\">\n      <span class=\"num\">329</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear exactly what the legal basis is for appellants' request for a remand.  That is, it is not clear whether appellants are contending that the district court did not conduct the analysis required by Hensley in cases of interrelated claims, or, instead are contending that the court conducted the analysis, but came to the wrong conclusion.  We consider, and reject, both possibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p330\">\n      <span class=\"num\">330</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants overstate their case when they assert that the court \"made no reduction for counsel fees as a result\" of unsuccessful claims.  The district court specifically found that on two dates (February 2 and 5, 1993) research was undertaken on issues on which plaintiffs did not prevail, but that \"the issues are interwoven\";  the court stated that it was reducing the charges allowed for those two days by 50%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p331\">\n      <span class=\"num\">331</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we interpret the statement that \"the issues are interwoven\" as having been intended to invoke the Hensley analysis, it is, to be sure, not a sufficient explanation of the basis of the court's award of fees in a case of purportedly interrelated claims.  It falls short of the \"thorough and detailed opinion reviewing the imbrication between the successful and unsuccessful claims\" that was before the court in Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.   In the present case, the district court did not--as far as we can tell on the record before us--\"make clear that it considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the result obtained.\"   See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.   The court's order does not reflect a Hensley analysis of the relationship among the claims;  in fact, it does not indicate what issues the court has determined to be interrelated, or even whether they are issues of fact or law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p332\">\n      <span class=\"num\">332</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, our review of the record leads us to conclude that Scarfo's claims of sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress shared sufficient common issues of fact with her successful claims under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act to justify the award made in this case.  In any event, we conclude that appellants should not now be heard on their request for remand because they did not adequately present this issue to the trial court or in the briefs filed with this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p333\">\n      <span class=\"num\">333</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's order, it is true, does not address the nature of legal work performed by Scarfo's counsel beyond the research billed for February 2 and February 5, 1993.  But we will not ourselves consider, or remand to the district court for consideration of, a blanket request not specific enough for reasoned evaluation of the merits of the request.  Appellants have failed to meet their burden of production before the trial court and their burden of adequate briefing before this court.  This failure deprives both courts of an opportunity to make an intelligent and reasoned decision regarding the segregability of fees awarded for any work related to losing claims that took place on days other than February 2 and 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p334\">\n      <span class=\"num\">334</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties must fulfill certain obligations of specificity of grounds of claim or defense if the district court is to be able to make a reasoned decision as to a proper fee award.  The fee-seeker, for example, must provide a \"particularized account\" of his or her claim for fees.  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 527.   When a fee-seeker has not won on all counts but properly documents her claim for fees and plausibly asserts that the time cannot be allocated between successful and unsuccessful counts, it becomes the fee-target's burden to show a basis for segregability.  See Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.   Appellants failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p335\">\n      <span class=\"num\">335</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence before the district court, in the form of testimony by Scarfo's counsel, that the requested award already reflected a $75,000 deduction from overall costs to account for time spent solely on the sexual harassment and infliction of emotional distress claims;  the remainder of her firm's work on these claims, she testified, was closely related to the claims on which her client prevailed.  She also testified that the award did not include any expenses related to the defamation claim.  That testimony constituted a \"plausible assertion\" that counsel had already segregated fees to the extent practicable.  The credibility of that testimony is for the trial court, not this court, to determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p336\">\n      <span class=\"num\">336</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was free to challenge this assertion by pointing specifically to segregable aspects of the bill that formed the basis for the award.  The defendants' cross-examination of Scarfo's counsel regarding expenses billed for February 2 and February 5 apparently convinced the judge that a 50% reduction in the fees for those days was warranted, despite his conclusion that they pertained to \"interwoven\" issues.  Perhaps a further reduction in fees would have followed if defendants had presented an adequate basis for subjecting other billed hours to judicial scrutiny.  But defendants did not point to any other purportedly segregable entries in the bill submitted by Scarfo, either during cross-examination or in written submissions contained in the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p337\">\n      <span class=\"num\">337</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants did not even assert in the trial court that the award improperly included fees attributable to the defamation or breach of contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p338\">\n      <span class=\"num\">338</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' contentions at trial and before this court regarding the segregability of other claims, moreover, are merely statements of conclusions.  The written submissions to the trial court contained in the record before us merely stated conclusions that the losing claims \"have separate and distinct elements of proof requiring different testimony and documentary evidence\" or have a \"distinct and separate nature\" and are \"easily segregated.\"   Appellants' argument of segregability on appeal is even less specific than the arguments advanced before the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p339\">\n      <span class=\"num\">339</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, in which we do not even know what arguments the appellants would make on remand because they have failed to make those arguments to the trial court or to us, we conclude that it would be improper to give appellants another bite at the apple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p340\">\n      <span class=\"num\">340</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue to us that plaintiffs \"failed to establish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly failed to explain many of the general entries which were made.\"   Even if we were to construe these assertions as arguments independent of the arguments regarding segregability of fees, they are no more than statements of the conclusion appellants ask us to reach.  They do not constitute adequate explanation of a basis for reasoning to this conclusion from evidence of record.  We cannot sustain contentions of this kind.  See Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d at 352.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p341\">\n      <span class=\"num\">341</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reason, we cannot sustain appellants' argument that the award of expert fees was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XVI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p342\">\n      <span class=\"num\">342</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the trial court's judgment for plaintiffs Scarfo and Miller in all respects other than the amount of the damages award, which we modify, as stated below, for the reasons stated in Parts X-XIV of this Opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p343\">\n      <span class=\"num\">343</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiff Miller, on remand the trial court may allow the parties a reasonable time to file a stipulation with respect to the award to Miller for front pay.
