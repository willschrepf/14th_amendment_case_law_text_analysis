S.C.A. &#167; 3601 et seq.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In a trial without jury, the district judge found that appellee had engaged in a program of restriction in rentals which effectively excluded blacks before the effective date of the Act, but that the Government had failed to establish a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination after the effective date of the Act, as required by 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3613. We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee operates the One Tenth Street Apartments, a 96-unit high-rise in downtown Atlanta. The units range in price from $139 to $186 per month. Mr. Ted Levy, a majority stockholder and President of the Corporation, has general responsibility for operation of the apartments. Mrs. Francis Price, acting under Mr. Levy's authority, manages the apartments, maintains the rental office, and hires and supervises night managers and part-time rental clerks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All interested prospective tenants are required to complete a written application indicating: (1) present residence and landlord, (2) occupation and place of employment, (3) former employers, (4) two character or personal references, (5) two credit references, and (6) price range or rental unit desired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is no vacancy in the price range sought, the application is placed in a \"pending\" file in no particular order. When a vacancy occurs, it may be filled by a new application or by one of the pending applications, but no preference is given to pending applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless a rental applicant is personally known to Mrs. Price or is referred to her by a personal friend or is a prior tenant, it is a non-uniform practice to require a security deposit before the application will be processed, <i>i. e.,</i> before references are checked out and other information in the application is verified. In each instance, Mrs. Price or one of her rental clerks conducts an interview with the applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apartment has a continuing policy against admission of drunks, hippies, children and belligerent appearing applicants. As the trial judge found,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there is considerable subjective decision by Mrs. Price in rentals. While such a procedure appears necessary and practical on the part of management in order to keep undesirables of any race out of the building, it does create the \"opportunity\" for discrimination in rentals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the application, the character and credit checks, and the interview, the management decides whether to accept or reject the applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellee opened its doors in 1965, it has received approximately 850 written applications, twelve of which were made by blacks. While appellee rented to some 400 white tenants, it never admitted a black tenant prior to the filing of this suit on June 26, 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nine blacks made applications in 1968 and 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Pre-Act black applicants</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During 1968, appellee received five applications from blacks. All applicants were college graduates, and all were employed. After completing applications, they were told either that there were no vacancies or that they would be notified later, or they were instructed to call back. None of the applicants were contacted again and those who called back were told either that they had been rejected or that still no vacancies existed. Four of these applicants were never advised that a security deposit was required before their applications would be processed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> One of the applicants, Robert Pitts, told the management that he wanted to leave a $20 deposit if it would improve his chances. While the management did accept the deposit, none was requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"Colored\" or the letters \"C\" or \"N\" were placed on three of the applications. The trial judge specifically found, and appellee does not challenge, that \"[p]rior to the effective date of the Act on January 1, 1969, there existed at the defendant apartment a program of restrictions in rentals which effectively excluded Negroes.\" For example, after several fruitless phone calls and a second visit to the rental office, Pitts returned again to check on his application. This time appellee admitted to him that he had been rejected because the owners had not yet permitted integration of the apartment. In contrast, many whites were admitted during 1968 with little or no delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Post-Act black applicants</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, two of the previous applicants, Robert Pitts and Sandra Threadcraft, reinquired or reapplied. Additionally, for the first time, four other blacks submitted applications, only two of which warrant discussion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1969, three months after Pitts was rejected because of the apartment's policy of racial discrimination, he telephoned the rental office and asked if there had been any change in his \"status.\" Appellee replied, \"No.\" Thereafter Pitts made no further contact with the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miss Threadcraft reapplied in May 1969 and was advised that \"possibly\" her application was rejected on account of credit and/or lack of a security deposit. She then revisited the rental office, gave additional credit references, and demanded that a credit report be obtained. Both sides continued to display mutual hostility. Finally, Threadcraft was told that no vacancies existed but that she would be contacted shortly. After hearing nothing for two weeks, she called back and was told that she had been rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Lloyd also applied in May 1969 and was told that there were no vacancies but that he would be contacted. After hearing nothing, he called back and was told that he was rejected. The trial court found that he was justifiably rejected, since he had six children and the apartment was unable to get any credit information pertaining to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, the same day this suit was filed, Franklin Biggins applied for an apartment. Biggins was not advised of the deposit requirement. Although no apartments were available in his requested price range, he was told that there might be vacancies later and that he would be called.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, in contrast to the black applicants, some whites were admitted with little or no difficulty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Court's findings</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that <i>before</i> an applicant is advised of the security requirement he must meet certain objective requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> including the financial ability to satisfy rental obligations under the lease. This finding is clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. It is clear from the record that in almost every instance these criteria were not even considered <i>until</i> the applicant submitted a security deposit. Appellee repeatedly testified without contradiction that any person interested in an apartment is always advised that a security deposit is required, even if he \"actually talks funny or looks funny.\" Furthermore, unless the applicant is known to Mrs. Price, is referred to her by a personal friend, or is a prior tenant, he must submit a security deposit <i>before</i> his application is processed. In other words, appellee's policy was to refrain from processing an application <i>until</i> the applicant submitted a security deposit. This distinction is critical in view of the fact that many blacks were not advised of the deposit requirement; thus, their applications were shelved without further consideration or processing by the management. In light of this chronology, however sure the trial court may have been that its finding was correct, we cannot approve, because the undisputed testimony is to the contrary. Janigan v. Taylor, 1 Cir. 1965, 344 F.2d 781, 784, cert. denied, 1965, 382 U.S. 879, 86 S.Ct. 163, 15 L.Ed.2d 120; <i>see</i> Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry., 1951, 340 U.S. 573, 576-577, 71 S.Ct. 428, 95 L.Ed. 547.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court also found that Pitts was not subjected to discrimination after the effective date of the Act, since he did not formally reapply for an apartment in 1969. However, the Government points out that Pitts, having been rejected in 1968, again called Mrs. Price in 1969 and was informed that his status had not changed. According to the Government, Mrs. Price's response can only be interpreted as an admission that the management's policy of racial discrimination remained in effect. It taxes credulity to conclude otherwise. The trial court placed mistaken importance on whether Pitts' 1969 call constituted a reapplication. It is clear that during the conversation he was discouraged from making another offer to rent an apartment; telling him that his status remained unchanged was tantamount to saying that in view of the management's continuing policy of segregation, any reapplication would be fruitless. Thus it was not necessary for Pitts to formally renew his application, or otherwise make a bona fide offer to rent. This Court is in substantially as good a position as the District Court to draw inferences and conclusions from the 1969 phone conversation between Pitts and Mrs. Price. Daniel v. First National Bank of Birmingham, 5 Cir. 1956, 228 F.2d 803, 805; <i>see</i> Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 5 Cir. 1954, 218 F.2d 217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government also argues that appellee discriminated against John Lloyd. In view of the conflicting testimony concerning Lloyd's treatment, due regard must be given to the trial court which had an opportunity to assess the witnesses' credibility. Rule 52(a), Fed. R.Civ.P.; <i>see</i> Bryan v. Kershaw, 5 Cir. 1966, 366 F.2d 497, 499, cert. denied, 1967, 386 U.S. 959, 87 S.Ct. 1030, 18 L. Ed.2d 108. The trial judge accepted appellee's contention that it rejected Lloyd because the management was unable to verify his credit and because he had too many children. These findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pretermit discussion of appellee's contention that Threadcraft's rejection was based solely on a credit check, since appellee does not challenge the finding that Threadcraft was told no vacancy existed when in fact an apartment was available. 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3604(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court must determine the correctness of the District Court's finding that no post-Act pattern or practice of discrimination existed. United States v. Fox, 5 Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 449, 453. Appellee, however, urges that we are bound by the clearly erroneous rule in reviewing the District Court's finding that the Government failed to establish a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in rentals after the effective date of the Act, January 1, 1969. This finding was based primarily on an accompanying finding that appellee committed only a single isolated act of discrimination &#8212; <i>i. e.,</i> the Threadcraft incident. This latter finding is clearly erroneous in view of our conclusion that Pitts too was subjected to discrimination in a <i>manner which manifested a continuing discriminatory policy</i> after the effective date of the Act. Furthermore, in finding no pattern or practice, the trial court relied partly on its finding that Story's application was <i>processed</i> without regard to race. Nevertheless, the evidence clearly indicates that Story's application never reached the processing stage, since she never manifested a serious interest in renting an apartment. Thus, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that application of the clearly erroneus rule is necessary, it becomes clear that the District Court's ultimate finding of no post-Act pattern or practice &#8212; based substantially on the erroneous preliminary findings discussed above &#8212; was itself clearly erroneous. We are \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 1948, 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746; Daniel v. First National Bank of Birmingham, <i>supra,</i> 228 F.2d at 805.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Significance of an established pre-Act \"pattern or practice\".</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision is not founded solely on the Government's evidence of post-Act discrimination. In the factual context of this case, we need not so limit our consideration. The Government relies on a series of labor discrimination cases, including United States v. Sheet Metal Workers, Intern. Ass'n, Local Union No. 36, 8 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 123, decided under the Fair Employment Practices Act, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-15, to support the proposition that there need be no showing of an independent post-Act pattern or practice. In <i>Sheet Metal Workers,</i> however, pre-Act exclusions of blacks from the unions directly resulted in blacks not being hired after the effective date of the Employment Practices Act since persons with union experience were given priority. The post-Act priority system utilized by the unions functioned as a \"grandfather clause\" which effectively prevented blacks from being hired due to their race and, in effect, perpetuated or carried forward the pre-Act discriminatory practice, even though there were no post-Act refusals of black applicants as such for union membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, no \"grandfather clause\" device nor anything analogous to it was employed. Appellee's pre-Act refusals to rent to Pitts and Threadcraft did not mandate their rejections in 1969. No priority system was applied to the apartment's applicants. However, <i>Sheet Metal Workers</i> is relevant here in at least one aspect. When there is a finding of a pre-Act pattern or practice of discrimination, and little or no evidence indicates a post-Act change in such pattern or practice up to the time suit is filed, a strong inference that the pre-Act pattern or practice continued after the effective date of the Act arises. <i>Id.</i> at 127. Such evidence alone does not create a <i>prima facie</i> case of post-Act pattern or practice, but it is of significant probative value. <i>See</i> Local Lodge No. 1424 v. NLRB, 1960, 362 U.S. 411, 416, 80 S.Ct. 822, 4 L.Ed.2d 832; FTC v. Cement Institute, 1948, 333 U.S. 683, 705, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010; United States v. Fox, <i>supra</i>; United States v. Duke, 5 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 759, 766; United States v. Lynd, 5 Cir. 1963, 321 F.2d 26, 28, cert. denied, 1964, 375 U.S. 968, 84 S.Ct. 486, 11 L. Ed.2d 416; Kennedy v. Lynd, 5 Cir. 1962, 306 F.2d 222, 228, cert. denied, 1963, 371 U.S. 952, 83 S.Ct. 507, 9 L. Ed.2d 500. <i>Cf.</i> Patton v. Mississippi, 1947, 332 U.S. 463, 466, 68 S.Ct. 184, 92 L.Ed. 76; Hill v. Texas, 1942, 316 U.S. 400, 62 S.Ct. 1159, 86 L.Ed. 1559. In the instant case there were at least two post-Act discriminatory rejections; in <i>Sheet Metal Workers</i> there were no post-Act refusals to hire. Thus the inference should be even more compelling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Post-Act \"pattern or practice\"</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the question whether the 1969 acts of discrimination against Pitts and Threadcraft were isolated incidents or part of a pattern or practice of discrimination under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The Act does not define \"pattern or practice\", and the phrase is not explained by the legislative history. Relevant, however, are judicial and legislative interpretations of the phrase under earlier civil rights acts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1960, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971(e). The words \"pattern or practice\" were not intended to be esoteric words of art. There is nothing magic in their meaning. United States v. Mayton, 5 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 153, 158-159. To be sure, they were intended to encompass more than an \"isolated or accidental or peculiar event.\" <i>See</i> Hearings on H.R. 10327 Before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 13; United States v. Mayton, <i>supra,</i> at 158-159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The number of blacks actually turned away or discriminated against is not determinative. United States v. Ramsey, 5 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 824, 837 (concurring opinion). Nevertheless, we do note that in a case brought under the Act involving \"blockbusting,\" three &#167; 3604 violations were sufficient to establish a pattern or practice. United States v. Mintzes, D.Md.1969, 304 F. Supp. 1305, 1314-1315. In any event, no mathematical formula is workable, nor was any intended. Each case must turn on its own facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee's admission to Pitts before the effective date of the Act that it had a policy of discrimination and its statement to the same applicant after the effective date of the Act that his \"status\" remained unchanged comprise evidence of a post-Act \"pattern or practice.\" See United States v. Duke, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the failure to advise many black applicants of the security deposit prerequisite to consideration of their applications was discriminatory. Incidents of such discrimination occurred both before and after the effective date of the Act. As a matter of established policy, except in certain circumstances explained <i>supra,</i> appellee does not process applications until a deposit is submitted by the applicant. In 1968, however, three of the black applicants were not advised of the deposit requirement; there was no finding as to the fourth, Miss Threadcraft. In 1969, two applicants were not advised. As to the remaining black applicants, there was no finding. In contrast, whites were admitted with little or no delay, and in some instances the deposit requirement was waived or no credit check was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not question the legitimacy of requiring a deposit before a prospective tenant's application is processed. An apartment owner or manager absorbs considerable time and expense verifying information in an application and in checking personal and credit references. If the applicant is not really serious about renting in a particular instance, this time and expense will have been wasted. Mrs. Price testified that if an applicant does not leave a deposit, she assumes that he is not interested, and the application is placed in a \"dead file\" without being processed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally the justification for a security deposit is that it is good business practice. But in this case, the facially neutral deposit requirement served yet another function &#8212; an excuse not to process the applications of many blacks. Appellee's assertion that the deposit requirement was not conceived out of racial discrimination is of no avail, since the requirement was administered in a discriminatory manner.

United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 583, aff'd, 371 U.S. 37, 83 S.Ct. 145, 9 L.Ed. 2d 112, a suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1960, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971 et seq., the defendant raised the same argument with reference to a provision of that Act which provided for \"a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, <i>or other order.\"</i> 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971(c) (emphasis added). The portion of &#167; 3613 which appellee here seeks to limit is identical in wording. In <i>Alabama,</i> this Court held that the phrase \"or other order\" includes the power to grant affirmative relief. <i>Id.</i> at 590. Indeed, the federal courts are fully empowered to eliminate the present effects of past discrimination. Local 53, of Intern. Ass'n of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers v.

While appellee rented to some 400 white tenants, it never admitted a black tenant prior to the filing of this suit on June 26, 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nine blacks made applications in 1968 and 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Pre-Act black applicants</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During 1968, appellee received five applications from blacks. All applicants were college graduates, and all were employed. After completing applications, they were told either that there were no vacancies or that they would be notified later, or they were instructed to call back. None of the applicants were contacted again and those who called back were told either that they had been rejected or that still no vacancies existed. Four of these applicants were never advised that a security deposit was required before their applications would be processed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> One of the applicants, Robert Pitts, told the management that he wanted to leave a $20 deposit if it would improve his chances.

The trial judge specifically found, and appellee does not challenge, that \"[p]rior to the effective date of the Act on January 1, 1969, there existed at the defendant apartment a program of restrictions in rentals which effectively excluded Negroes.\" For example, after several fruitless phone calls and a second visit to the rental office, Pitts returned again to check on his application. This time appellee admitted to him that he had been rejected because the owners had not yet permitted integration of the apartment. In contrast, many whites were admitted during 1968 with little or no delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Post-Act black applicants</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, two of the previous applicants, Robert Pitts and Sandra Threadcraft, reinquired or reapplied.

She then revisited the rental office, gave additional credit references, and demanded that a credit report be obtained. Both sides continued to display mutual hostility. Finally, Threadcraft was told that no vacancies existed but that she would be contacted shortly. After hearing nothing for two weeks, she called back and was told that she had been rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Lloyd also applied in May 1969 and was told that there were no vacancies but that he would be contacted. After hearing nothing, he called back and was told that he was rejected. The trial court found that he was justifiably rejected, since he had six children and the apartment was unable to get any credit information pertaining to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, the same day this suit was filed, Franklin Biggins applied for an apartment.

This finding is clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. It is clear from the record that in almost every instance these criteria were not even considered <i>until</i> the applicant submitted a security deposit. Appellee repeatedly testified without contradiction that any person interested in an apartment is always advised that a security deposit is required, even if he \"actually talks funny or looks funny.\" Furthermore, unless the applicant is known to Mrs. Price, is referred to her by a personal friend, or is a prior tenant, he must submit a security deposit <i>before</i> his application is processed. In other words, appellee's policy was to refrain from processing an application <i>until</i> the applicant submitted a security deposit. This distinction is critical in view of the fact that many blacks were not advised of the deposit requirement; thus, their applications were shelved without further consideration or processing by the management. In light of this chronology, however sure the trial court may have been that its finding was correct, we cannot approve, because the undisputed testimony is to the contrary. Janigan v.

However, the Government points out that Pitts, having been rejected in 1968, again called Mrs. Price in 1969 and was informed that his status had not changed. According to the Government, Mrs. Price's response can only be interpreted as an admission that the management's policy of racial discrimination remained in effect. It taxes credulity to conclude otherwise. The trial court placed mistaken importance on whether Pitts' 1969 call constituted a reapplication. It is clear that during the conversation he was discouraged from making another offer to rent an apartment; telling him that his status remained unchanged was tantamount to saying that in view of the management's continuing policy of segregation, any reapplication would be fruitless. Thus it was not necessary for Pitts to formally renew his application, or otherwise make a bona fide offer to rent. This Court is in substantially as good a position as the District Court to draw inferences and conclusions from the 1969 phone conversation between Pitts and Mrs. Price. Daniel v.

Appellee, however, urges that we are bound by the clearly erroneous rule in reviewing the District Court's finding that the Government failed to establish a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in rentals after the effective date of the Act, January 1, 1969. This finding was based primarily on an accompanying finding that appellee committed only a single isolated act of discrimination &#8212; <i>i. e.,</i> the Threadcraft incident. This latter finding is clearly erroneous in view of our conclusion that Pitts too was subjected to discrimination in a <i>manner which manifested a continuing discriminatory policy</i> after the effective date of the Act. Furthermore, in finding no pattern or practice, the trial court relied partly on its finding that Story's application was <i>processed</i> without regard to race. Nevertheless, the evidence clearly indicates that Story's application never reached the processing stage, since she never manifested a serious interest in renting an apartment. Thus, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that application of the clearly erroneus rule is necessary, it becomes clear that the District Court's ultimate finding of no post-Act pattern or practice &#8212; based substantially on the erroneous preliminary findings discussed above &#8212; was itself clearly erroneous.

Ass'n, Local Union No. 36, 8 Cir. 1969, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286574\"><a href=\"/opinion/286574/united-states-v-the-sheet-metal-workers-international-association-local/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, decided under the Fair Employment Practices Act, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-15, to support the proposition that there need be no showing of an independent post-Act pattern or practice. In <i>Sheet Metal Workers,</i> however, pre-Act exclusions of blacks from the unions directly resulted in blacks not being hired after the effective date of the Employment Practices Act since persons with union experience were given priority. The post-Act priority system utilized by the unions functioned as a \"grandfather clause\" which effectively prevented blacks from being hired due to their race and, in effect, perpetuated or carried forward the pre-Act discriminatory practice, even though there were no post-Act refusals of black applicants as such for union membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, no \"grandfather clause\" device nor anything analogous to it was employed. Appellee's pre-Act refusals to rent to Pitts and Threadcraft did not mandate their rejections in 1969. No priority system was applied to the apartment's applicants. However, <i>Sheet Metal Workers</i> is relevant here in at least one aspect. When there is a finding of a pre-Act pattern or practice of discrimination, and little or no evidence indicates a post-Act change in such pattern or practice up to the time suit is filed, a strong inference that the pre-Act pattern or practice continued after the effective date of the Act arises. <i>Id.</i> at 127.

The Act does not define \"pattern or practice\", and the phrase is not explained by the legislative history. Relevant, however, are judicial and legislative interpretations of the phrase under earlier civil rights acts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1960, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971(e).

Each case must turn on its own facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee's admission to Pitts before the effective date of the Act that it had a policy of discrimination and its statement to the same applicant after the effective date of the Act that his \"status\" remained unchanged comprise evidence of a post-Act \"pattern or practice.\" See United States v. Duke, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the failure to advise many black applicants of the security deposit prerequisite to consideration of their applications was discriminatory. Incidents of such discrimination occurred both before and after the effective date of the Act. As a matter of established policy, except in certain circumstances explained <i>supra,</i> appellee does not process applications until a deposit is submitted by the applicant. In 1968, however, three of the black applicants were not advised of the deposit requirement; there was no finding as to the fourth, Miss Threadcraft. In 1969, two applicants were not advised. As to the remaining black applicants, there was no finding. In contrast, whites were admitted with little or no delay, and in some instances the deposit requirement was waived or no credit check was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not question the legitimacy of requiring a deposit before a prospective tenant's application is processed. An apartment owner or manager absorbs considerable time and expense verifying information in an application and in checking personal and credit references. If the applicant is not really serious about renting in a particular instance, this time and expense will have been wasted. Mrs. Price testified that if an applicant does not leave a deposit, she assumes that he is not interested, and the application is placed in a \"dead file\" without being processed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally the justification for a security deposit is that it is good business practice. But in this case, the facially neutral deposit requirement served yet another function &#8212; an excuse not to process the applications of many blacks. Appellee's assertion that the deposit requirement was not conceived out of racial discrimination is of no avail, since the requirement was administered in a discriminatory manner. Failure to advise these applicants of the deposit requirement was a disingenuous scheme or device to exclude blacks from the apartments and is additional evidence of a post-Act pattern or practice of racial discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Summary</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The post-Act discriminations against Pitts and Threadcraft, the admission to Pitts that the apartment's policy of maintaining a segregated apartment continued into 1969, the failure to advise several of the post-Act applicants of the deposit requirement, and the absence of persuasive indications that a cessation in an admitted pre-Act pattern or practice occurred establish a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in renting after the effective date of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Order and decree</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee's argument that the Court is limited to issuing an injunction in granting relief under 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3613 is without merit.
