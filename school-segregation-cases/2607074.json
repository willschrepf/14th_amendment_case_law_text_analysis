CHIEF JUSTICE CASTILLE                              DECIDED: November 19, 2014\n      Omega Flex, Inc., appeals the decision of the Superior Court to affirm the\n\njudgment on the verdict entered in favor of Terrence D. Tincher and Judith R. Tincher\n\n(the “Tinchers”) by the Chester County Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division. We\n\nreverse the Superior Court decision in part, upon reasoning different from that\n\narticulated by the courts below, and we remand to the trial court for further action upon\n\nOmega Flex’s post-trial motions, consistent with the principles elucidated in this\n\nOpinion. We hold that:\n\n             1.   This Court’s decision in Azzarello v. Black Brothers\n             Company, 391 A.2d 1020 (Pa. 1978) is hereby overruled.\n\n             2.     Having considered the common law of Pennsylvania,\n             the provenance of the strict product liability cause of action,\n             the interests and the policy which the strict liability cause of\n\f              action vindicates, and alternative standards of proof utilized\n              in sister jurisdictions, we conclude that a plaintiff pursuing a\n              cause upon a theory of strict liability in tort must prove that\n              the product is in a “defective condition.” The plaintiff may\n              prove defective condition by showing either that (1) the\n              danger is unknowable and unacceptable to the average or\n              ordinary consumer, or that (2) a reasonable person would\n              conclude that the probability and seriousness of harm\n              caused by the product outweigh the burden or costs of\n              taking precautions.        The burden of production and\n              persuasion is by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n              3.     Whether a product is in a defective condition is a\n              question of fact ordinarily submitted for determination to the\n              finder of fact; the question is removed from the jury’s\n              consideration only where it is clear that reasonable minds\n              could not differ on the issue. Thus, the trial court is\n              relegated to its traditional role of determining issues of law,\n              e.g., on dispositive motions, and articulating the law for the\n              jury, premised upon the governing legal theory, the facts\n              adduced at trial and relevant advocacy by the parties.\n\n              4.     To the extent relevant here, we decline to adopt the\n              Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability §§ 1 et seq.,\n              albeit appreciation of certain principles contained in that\n              Restatement has certainly informed our consideration of the\n              proper approach to strict liability in Pennsylvania in the post-\n              Azzarello paradigm.\n\n\n\n                                   I.       Background\n\n        Around 2:30 a.m. on June 20, 2007, neighbors reported a fire that had erupted at\n\nthe home of the Tinchers in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.            The residence was the\n\ncentral unit of a two-story triplex built in 1998-99, and purchased by the Tinchers in\n\n2005.     The fire was eventually extinguished and no persons were harmed.\n\nSubsequently, investigators concluded that a lightning strike near the Tinchers’ home\n\ncaused a small puncture in the corrugated stainless steel tubing (“CSST”) transporting\n\nnatural gas to a fireplace located on the first floor of the residence. The CSST installed\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 2\n\fin the Tinchers’ home was manufactured and sold by Omega Flex as part of a gas\n\ntransportations system marketed as the TracPipe System.           The heat attending the\n\nmelting of the CSST caused by the lightning strike ignited the natural gas and fueled a\n\nfire estimated to have burned for over an hour. The fire caused significant damage to\n\nthe Tinchers’ home and belongings.\n\n        After the fire, the Tinchers reported the incident to their insurer, United Services\n\nAutomobile Association (“USAA”). USAA compensated the Tinchers for their loss up to\n\nthe limit of their policy and received an assignment of liability claims. The Tinchers\n\nsuffered an additional out-of-pocket loss because a portion of their claimed loss\n\nexceeded the limits of the USAA policy.\n\n        In January 2008, the Tinchers filed a complaint against Omega Flex in the\n\nChester County Court of Common Pleas.1 USAA prosecuted the claims in the name of\n\nthe Tinchers to obtain reimbursement of the insurance proceeds payout, but the\n\nTinchers retained an interest in the litigation to recover the losses exceeding their\n\ninsurance coverage. The Tinchers asserted claims premised upon theories of strict\n\nliability, negligence, and breach of warranty.\n\n        In relevant part, the Tinchers’ complaint relies upon the theory of strict liability\n\narticulated in Section 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts, but as followed and\n\nconstrued in Pennsylvania. Complaint, 3/18/2008, at ¶¶ 19-25 (citing RESTATEMENT (2D)\n\nOF   TORTS § 402A). The Tinchers alleged that Omega Flex is liable for damages to their\n\nhome caused by the placement on the market and sale of the TracPipe System.\n\n1\n       The Tinchers also named as defendants R & L Plumbing Contractors, Inc.,\nJoseph Rosati Plumbing, Inc., and Joseph R. Rosati, Jr., individually and d/b/a Joseph\nRosati Plumbing & Heating. Omega Flex asserted cross-claims against its co-\ndefendants. In October 2010, the Tinchers and Omega Flex voluntarily dismissed with\nprejudice all claims against these additional parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 3\n\fAccording to the Tinchers, the CSST incorporated into the TracPipe System is\n\ndefective, and unreasonably dangerous to intended users, because its walls are too thin\n\nto withstand the effects of lightning. The Tinchers requested compensatory damages,\n\ninterest, fees, and costs of litigation. Omega Flex answered the complaint denying the\n\nTinchers’ allegations. The matter was assigned to the Honorable Ronald C. Nagle,\n\nSenior Judge of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas. The parties proceeded\n\nwith discovery and the filing of dispositive motions, which the trial court denied.\n\n         In September 2010, in anticipation of trial, Omega Flex filed a motion in limine\n\nrequesting the application of Sections 1 and 2 of the Third Restatement of Torts to the\n\nTinchers’ strict liability claim. Omega Flex also proposed jury instructions and findings\n\nof fact consistent with the provisions of the Third Restatement. The Tinchers opposed\n\nOmega Flex’s motion in limine and offered proposed jury instructions and findings of\n\nfact consistent with the Second Restatement and Azzarello, supra. The trial court did\n\nnot resolve Omega Flex’s motion before trial. See Notes of Testimony, 8/12/2011, at\n\n17-22.\n\n         In October 2010, the parties proceeded to trial before a jury. At trial, the Tinchers\n\noffered evidence regarding the events of June 20, 2007, the subsequent investigation\n\ninto the cause of the fire, the losses sustained by the Tinchers, and USAA’s process of\n\nadjusting the insurance claim. The parties generally agreed that lightning had caused\n\nthe fire, although they disagreed as to the sequence of events or the cause of ignition in\n\nthe area of the fireplace. The Tinchers offered evidence that lightning transferred an\n\nelectrical charge to parts of the home, including the TracPipe System; the electrical\n\ncurrent then sought ground and created different electrical charges in the various metal\n\ncomponents of the structure. The Tinchers’ expert witnesses testified that a flow of\n\nenergy between a differently charged TracPipe and another metal component of the\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 4\n\fhome caused an electrical arc, and the accompanying heat punctured the CSST and\n\nignited the natural gas that the CSST transported. According to the Tinchers’ expert,\n\nthe perforation in the corrugated stainless steel tubing from the Tinchers’ home was\n\n“characteristic of a lightning strike, not anything else.” By comparison, Omega Flex’s\n\nwitnesses testified that lightning measured near the Tinchers’ home on the night of the\n\nfire did not carry sufficient energy to puncture the CSST. According to these witnesses,\n\nonce lightning entered the house, lightning-related high voltages -- although with low\n\nenergy -- broke down the insulation on electrical wires and, if the circuit breakers did not\n\ninterrupt the current, the electrical current caused the fire. Omega Flex also responded\n\nthat the conditions of the Tinchers’ home after the fire and after the investigation, during\n\nwhich part of the evidence had been removed from its original location, made it\n\nimpossible to confirm the Tinchers’ theory. Finally, Omega Flex offered evidence that\n\nan attempt had been made to bond the TracPipe System to the cold water pipe at the\n\nTinchers’ residence which, if successful, would have prevented the electrical arc -- and\n\nthe resulting fire -- from occurring. Witnesses testified that, after the fire, a bonding\n\nclamp had been found connected to the CSST and near but disconnected from the cold\n\nwater pipe. The parties offered competing testimony as to whether the clamp had been\n\nattached to the cold water pipe before the fire.\n\n       Relevant to their strict liability theory, the Tinchers offered testimony regarding a\n\ndefect in the TracPipe from experts in electrical engineering and metallurgy, electrical\n\narc physics, and material science -- Mr. Mark Goodson and Dr. Thomas Eager,\n\nrespectively. These experts opined that CSST is inherently defective because its wall is\n\n1/100 of an inch thick -- the width of four sheets of paper -- and, as a result, the\n\nprobability is “very high,” “close to a hundred percent,” that a lightning-generated current\n\nwill perforate it. By comparison, an alternative natural gas conduit made of black iron\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 5\n\fpipe is ten times thicker for a half-inch diameter pipe similar to the CSST present in the\n\nTincher home. According to the witnesses, CSST withstands the transfer of ten times\n\nless energy than black iron pipe and, given the same energy, the amount of time to\n\npuncture CSST is 1/100 the amount of time required to puncture black iron pipe.\n\nExperts estimated that an electric arc is fifty thousand to a million times more likely to\n\nperforate CSST than black iron pipe.\n\n       The witnesses acknowledged that the energy transferred by any particular\n\nlightning strike is difficult to predict and cannot be replicated in a lab, but concluded that\n\nthe probability was high that CSST would be punctured by occurrences within expected\n\nranges of electrical current.    Such results, according to the Tinchers’ experts, are\n\nobservable and predictable with equations developed in the Nineteenth Century.\n\nNevertheless, the experts noted that Omega Flex had not conducted testing on the\n\nTracPipe’s ability to withstand lightning strikes, although testing for resistance to\n\nlightning was necessary and available. Moreover, according to the Tinchers’ evidence,\n\nthe Omega Flex installation guide failed to direct compliance with lightning-related fire\n\nprotection codes.\n\n       The Tinchers’ witnesses also testified that Omega Flex recommended grounding\n\nthe TracPipe system by plugging any natural gas-fueled appliances into three-prong\n\noutlets. Additional grounding, although attempted at the Tinchers’ residence, was not\n\nrequired by the installation instructions provided by Omega Flex to professionals to\n\nwhom TracPipe was marketed and sold for installation in consumers’ homes.\n\nMoreover, according to the Tinchers’ experts, the bonding of the TracPipe System at\n\none location would be insufficient to protect the CSST from the effects of lightning. To\n\nbe effective, the witnesses testified, bonding would be required every ten feet, which the\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 6\n\fexperts deemed to be an impractical and unfeasible solution. The alternative would be\n\nto encase the CSST in black iron pipe. See N.T., 10/13/2010, at 291-98, 357-420.\n\n       After the Tinchers rested, Omega Flex moved for a nonsuit, citing the standard of\n\nthe Second Restatement and Azzarello; Omega Flex expressly assumed that the trial\n\ncourt had denied its request to apply the Third Restatement. N.T., 10/18/2010, at 514-\n\n16. The trial court denied the motion for a nonsuit. Id. at 525-26.\n\n       Subsequently, Omega Flex introduced the testimony of its own experts relating to\n\nthe defect in the TracPipe System alleged by the Tinchers. The witnesses were Dr.\n\nJames Dydo, an expert in metallurgy and mechanical engineering with a focus on fuel\n\ngas piping, and Dr. Michael Stringfellow, an expert in physics with a focus on lightning\n\nand the protection of structures from lightning. The Omega Flex experts opined that the\n\nTracPipe System is not defective or unreasonably dangerous. According to the defense\n\nexperts, CSST is a technology with significant advantages, including resistance to\n\ncorrosion, structural shifts, and mechanical ruptures; ease of installation, relocation, and\n\nretrofitting; and fewer joints accompanied by decreased susceptibility to natural gas\n\nleaks at any required joints. The experts noted that these net benefits are marked\n\nadvantages over black iron pipe arising from the flexibility of CSST. If CSST’s walls\n\nwere thickened, according to the experts, there would be little practical difference\n\nbetween CSST and black iron pipe.\n\n       The defense witnesses also testified that the TracPipe System meets and\n\nexceeds all standards for minimum performance governing CSST developed by the\n\nAmerican National Standards Institute, a clearinghouse for trade groups. Additionally,\n\nthe witnesses stated, installation of the TracPipe System conforms with the Fuel Gas\n\nCode and the National Electric Code in force in 1998-99. The experts emphasized that\n\nthese applicable standards did not anticipate intrusion by lightning as a possible safety\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 7\n\fconcern, suggesting that it was unnecessary for Omega Flex to have foreseen any\n\ndanger from lightning.\n\n       Finally, Omega Flex’s experts agreed that the installation instructions for the\n\nTracPipe System did not require installation of a bonding clamp. The witnesses also\n\nnoted, however, that a disconnected clamp was consistent with Omega Flex’s\n\nassessment of the circumstances surrounding the fire. The experts offered that the\n\nattempt to bond the TracPipe System to the cold water pipe was inadequate and that a\n\nsuccessful attempt would have likely averted the resulting fire. Id. at 657-712.\n\n       After resting its defense, Omega Flex offered a motion for a directed verdict\n\npremised upon Second Restatement principles and Azzarello. Omega Flex argued that\n\nproof of the overall risks and benefits of the TracPipe System, and of any reasonable\n\nalternative designs, showed that TracPipe was not unreasonably dangerous. The trial\n\ncourt denied the motion for a directed verdict.             Both parties then offered closing\n\narguments on their respective theories of the case.               Subsequently, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury with respect to the Tinchers’ strict liability claim as follows:\n\n\n                      The contention of the [Tinchers] in this case is that\n              there is a defect in this product, this TracPipe. To state a\n              products liability claim, essentially it’s strict liability, a plaintiff\n              must prove, first, that the product was defective. Second,\n              that if [sic] a defect existed when it left the hands of the\n              defendant, that is, left the process by which it was produced\n              at the defendant[‘s] plant. And three, that the defect caused\n              the harm.\n\n                       A product is defective when it is not safe for its\n              intended purpose. That is, it leaves the suppliers’ control\n              lacking any element necessary to make it safe for its\n              intended use. The inquiry is whether or not there is a defect,\n              not whether the defendant[’s] conduct was negligent. In\n              strict liability there is no consideration of negligence. It is\n              simply, was the product defective or wasn’t it defective.\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 8\n\f                    *      *      *       *\n\n         Defective design. The manufactur[er] of a product is\nreally a guarantor of its safety. When we talk about strict\nliability, the product must be provided with every element\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use. And without\nany conditions that make[] it unsafe for its intended use. If\nyou find that the product in this case, the TracPipe, at the\ntime it left the defendant[’s] control, lacked any elements\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use, or contained\nany condition that made it unsafe for its intended use, and\nthere was an alternative more practical design, more safer\n[sic] design, then the product is considered defective and the\ndefendant is liable for the harm, if you find that defect\ncaused the harm[,] was the proximate cause of the harm to\nthe plaintiffs.\n\n         Now, ladies and gentlemen, a product is not defective\nmerely because it is possible to be injured while using the\nproduct. The imposition of strict liability is not meant to\ntransform manufacturers into insurers of all injuries that are\npotentially possible and [sic] at the hands of a product. A\nmanufacturer of a product may be a guarantor of the\nproduct[’s] safety, but under no circumstances is the\nmanufacturer an insurer of the safety of the product. The\nlaw does not force the manufacturer to become the insurer\nof the product under all conditions and uses.                A\nmanufacturer is not required to make an already safe\nproduct safer, or to utilize the safest of all designs. The\nmanufacturer is not required to produce or design a product\nincorporating only features representing the ultimate in\nsafety design. To prevail on a design defect theory, plaintiffs\nmust prove that the product is defective and that at the time\nit left the control of the manufacturer it lacked the feature\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use, or contained a\nfeature that made it unsafe for its intended use.\n\n        In other words, you may not find that the TracPipe\nproduct is defective merely because it could have been\nmade safer. Instead, you may only render a verdict for the\nplaintiff if you conclude and are convinced that the TracPipe\nis in fact defective and was so when it left the hands of the\n\n\n                        [J-80-2013] - 9\n\fmanufacturer and that defect was the proximate cause of the\n[Tinchers’] loss.\n\n         As I said before, and I instruct you that in order to\nestablish strict liability for putting a defective product in the\nstream of commerce, the plaintiffs are not required to prove\nthat the defendant was negligent. Negligence and strict\nliability are two separate concepts. I’ll get to negligence in a\nsecond. And no consideration should be given to negligence\nwhen considering strict liability for a defective product. It’s\ntwo different concepts. I understand it’s not the easiest thing\nto keep in mind. I’m trying to point out there is a difference\nbetween strict liability for putting a defective product that was\ndefective when it was designed and made in this stream of\ncommerce that causes harm to someone else, an intended\nuser, not just any user, but an intend[ed] user of that\nproduct.\n\n         Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, if this product was\nmanufactured and, obviously, the -- with all of the testimony\nin this case and the steps that were taken during the design\nand manufacturing process, Omega Flex knew it was going\nto be used for its intended purposes, to carry gas[,] natural\ngas, the manufacturer supplying the pipe guaranteed it\nwould be safe for its intend[ed] use. That is what strict\nliability means. So if something that is intended to be safe\nfor the use intended to be made of it is not, and it’s proven\nthat it’s not, and that proof has to come from the plaintiff, and\nthat defect is the proximate cause of what happens, there is\na lot of testimony in this case about that, then that is what\nstrict liability means. It does not have anything to do with\nnegligence in that aspect of the case. That is why the risk of\nloss, or if there is, or if you find there is a defect in strict\nliability, the risk of loss is placed upon the supplier or\nmanufacturer that put that product in this stream of\ncommerce. The risk of loss for injuries resulting from the\ndefective product is best warned [sic] by the person who\nmanufactured it, principally because they are the ones that\nput it in the stream of commerce and said it would work for\nits intended purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                       [J-80-2013] - 10\n\fN.T., 10/19/2010, at 794-98. Additionally, the trial court defined “proximate cause,” and\n\ninstructed the jury with respect to damages.          Id. at 802-07.    After the trial court\n\nconcluded its instructions on the law, counsel for Omega Flex noted for the record that\n\nOmega Flex had proposed instructions based upon the Third Restatement with respect\n\nto the strict liability claim and that any Second Restatement instructions it proposed\n\nwere offered in the alternative. The trial court responded that it had declined to instruct\n\nthe jury in accordance with Third Restatement principles because Pennsylvania\n\nappellate courts, and the Supreme Court especially, had not adopted the Third\n\nRestatement.\n\n       Subsequently, the jury returned to the courtroom with several questions.\n\nRelevant here, the trial court answered the jury by repeating definitions for the terms\n\n“defect” and “defective design” as offered in the original instructions.\n\n       On October 20, 2010, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Tinchers on the\n\nproducts liability claim, and awarded compensatory damages totaling $958,895.85.\n\nDamages were divided as follows: $406,532.90 (building); $988.83 (additional property\n\nand structures); $503,945.58 (contents); and $47,428.64 (alternate living expenses).\n\nThe trial court added $69,336.05 in delay damages, and entered judgment on the\n\nverdict.2   In November 2010, Omega Flex filed a motion for post-trial relief and\n\nsupporting brief requesting, among other things, a new trial premised upon trial court\n\nerrors in denying its motion in limine and in failing to instruct the jury on the law as\n\narticulated in the Third Restatement.        Additionally, Omega Flex sought judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the theory that the evidence introduced at trial was\n\ninsufficient to prove a claim of strict liability under Third Restatement principles.\n\n2\n      The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Omega Flex on the negligence claim.\nThere are no claims before this Court related to this part of the verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 11\n\f       Relating to the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Omega Flex\n\nargued that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to prove a\n\nstrict liability claim under the Third Restatement. In overlapping claims of error, Omega\n\nFlex also asserted that the Tinchers had not met their burden of proof under the so-\n\ncalled “fireworthiness” doctrine, which, as Omega Flex explained in its supporting brief,\n\nwas a Third-Restatement-like approach similar to the more familiar “crashworthiness”\n\nexception to the Second Restatement. Appellant’s Brief in Support of Motion for Post-\n\nTrial Relief 3/3/2011, at 9-27 (citing Pa. Dep’t of Gen. Serves. v. U.S. Mineral Prods.\n\nCo., 898 A.2d 590 (Pa. 2006) (“General Services”) and Gaudio v. Ford Motor Co., 976\n\nA.2d 524 (Pa. Super. 2009)). With respect to the motion for a new trial, Omega Flex\n\nalleged that the trial court erred in denying its motion in limine seeking to conduct the\n\ntrial in accordance with Third Restatement principles, and in failing to issue a jury\n\ncharge premised upon the Third Restatement or the fireworthiness / crashworthiness\n\ndoctrine.\n\n       In the brief supporting the post-trial motion, Omega Flex distilled what were\n\nseveral Third Restatement and fireworthiness doctrine claims into two main arguments.\n\nFirst, according to Omega Flex, judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial were\n\nappropriate under the Second Restatement because lightning protection, the safe\n\nconduction of electricity, or even a foreseeable event such as the fire are not intended\n\nuses of the TracPipe System. In the alternative, Omega Flex argued that, once the\n\nTinchers offered evidence that lightning was a “foreseeable” event, the dispute\n\nparadigm changed from a typical Second Restatement design defect case to a\n\nfireworthiness / crashworthiness case, which required the trial court to issue a jury\n\ninstruction that the Tinchers had the burden to prove the existence of an alternative\n\nsafer design similar to the burden articulated by the Third Restatement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 12\n\f       Second, Omega Flex argued that a new trial was appropriate because the trial\n\ncourt failed to charge the jury on the Third Restatement, which in its view stated the\n\nrelevant principle of law applicable to the circumstances alleged by the Tinchers.\n\nOmega Flex argued that application of the Third Restatement was supported by\n\nresponsive opinions authored and joined by several Justices of this Court and the\n\ndecision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Berrier v. Simplicity Mfg.,\n\n563 F.3d 38 (3d Cir. 2009). Appellant’s Brief in Support of Motion for Post-Trial Relief\n\n3/3/2011, at 36 (citing also Phillips v. Cricket Lighters, 841 A.2d 1000, 1020 (Pa. 2003)\n\n(Saylor, J., concurring, joined by Castille and Eakin, JJ.)).             Returning to its\n\nfireworthiness doctrine theory, Omega Flex emphasized that the trial court’s Azzarello-\n\nbased instructions on the Second Restatement confused the jury: first, by mentioning,\n\nwithout explaining, the relevance of evidence of a proposed alternative design, i.e., the\n\nblack pipe system; second, by failing to guide the jury on the burden of proof relating to\n\nthe alternative design; and, third, by failing to explain how the jury should consider the\n\nrole of lightning in assessing liability. Additionally, Omega Flex argued that the failure to\n\ncharge the jury, and relatedly the absence from the verdict sheet, of foreseeability-\n\nbased principles and elements related to the existence of a safer alternative design,\n\nerroneously lessened the Tinchers’ burden of proof. Id. at 31-40.\n\n       In response, the Tinchers asserted that the “fireworthiness” instruction requested\n\nby Omega Flex had no applicability to the Tinchers’ circumstances.            The Tinchers\n\nexplained that the decision in General Services was distinguishable on the facts: in\n\nGeneral Services, the product released harmful chemicals when exposed to a fire\n\ncaused by unrelated events; because the fire was not an intended use of the product,\n\nthis Court held that strict liability principles were inapplicable.    By comparison, the\n\nTinchers noted that the allegations in this matter were that the defect in CSST even\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 13\n\fwhen employed for its intended use, i.e., carrying natural gas, caused the fire; these\n\nallegations implicated a manufacturer’s strict liability for the alleged defect.       The\n\nTinchers then argued that the evidence offered at trial was sufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s gateway decision related to the risk-utility analysis as well as the jury’s ultimate\n\nverdict. The Tinchers also responded that the Third Restatement was not applicable in\n\nPennsylvania and that, until this Court adopts the Third Restatement, the governing law\n\nremains the Second Restatement.        Moreover, the Tinchers asserted that the Third\n\nCircuit’s prediction that this Court would eventually adopt the Third Restatement is\n\npremature and unwarranted, citing the Superior Court decisions in Gaudio, supra, and\n\nFrench v. Commonwealth Associates, 980 A.2d 623 (Pa. Super. 2009). Appellees’ Brief\n\nin Opposition to Motion for Post-Trial Relief, 3/9/2011, at 2-15. At oral argument on the\n\npost-trial motion, the parties offered similar arguments focusing on the fireworthiness\n\ndoctrine. Omega Flex noted that the case was appropriate for application of the Third\n\nRestatement and emphasized the claims of jury confusion, but agreed not to press\n\narguments relating to the adoption of the Third Restatement at the trial court level. N.T.,\n\n3/11/2011, at 9-10; 39-43. The trial court denied the motion. On June 2, 2011, the trial\n\ncourt entered judgment on the verdict, in the amount of $1,028,231.90.\n\n       Omega Flex appealed the judgment to the Superior Court.              The trial court\n\nordered Omega Flex to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal.\n\nOrder, 6/17/2011 (per curiam) (citing Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)). In its Rule 1925(b) statement,\n\nOmega Flex raised related claims of error, in relevant part, that the evidence introduced\n\nat trial was insufficient to prove claims of strict liability under the Second and Third\n\nRestatements; and that the jury should have been charged and offered a verdict form\n\npremised upon the Third Restatement or the related theory of fireworthiness /\n\ncrashworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 14\n\f       In the post-trial relief and Rule 1925(a) opinions, the trial court rejected Omega\n\nFlex’s arguments. The trial court found no error in declining to apply and instruct the\n\njury on the Third Restatement, reasoning that this Court had yet to adopt that iteration of\n\ntort law to replace the Second Restatement. The trial court noted that, while Omega\n\nFlex “may have the right to advance on appeal to our Supreme Court that it should\n\nadopt the [Third Restatement], under current law, [the Tinchers] bore no burden to\n\nprove a safer alternate design existed in accordance with the latter standard.” Trial\n\nCourt Op., 8/5/2011, at 11.\n\n       In addition, the trial court explained that a “fireworthiness” instruction -- as an\n\nextension of the “crashworthiness” doctrine, requiring “a more rigorous standard of proof\n\nthan the usual [Second Restatement] claim,” was not appropriate either, because\n\nTracPipe had been employed for its intended use. According to the trial court, the\n\nTinchers’ case did not relate to how the TracPipe performed during the fire, as in\n\nGeneral Services; rather, the defect in the TracPipe they pursued was the proximate\n\ncause of the Tinchers’ injuries. The trial court held that the trial court rather than the\n\njury properly decided the question of a feasible alternative design, and that the Tinchers\n\nhad carried their burden of proof.\n\n       The parties offered arguments in their briefing to the Superior Court on issues\n\nsimilar to those raised in the post-trial motion and Rule 1925(b) statement. Relating to\n\nthe Third Restatement, Omega Flex acknowledged that decisions of this Court bound\n\nthe lower court, but offered that this case would be a fitting vehicle for this Court to\n\nrevisit strict liability standards.   According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement\n\nexpressly incorporates foreseeability standards into the strict liability analysis, and\n\nrequires a plaintiff to establish the existence of a reasonable alternative design for the\n\nfactfinder.   The trial court, Omega Flex argued, following existing decisional law,\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 15\n\finstructed the jury inadequately, noting in particular that the Tinchers were not “required\n\nto prove the existence of a feasible alternative design to prevail on [their] strict-liability\n\nclaim.” Omega Flex claimed that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict premised upon error in instructing the jury, and requested a\n\nnew trial on this basis. Appellant’s Super. Ct. Brief at 33-36. The Tinchers responded\n\nthat Omega Flex’s arguments relating to the Third Restatement have no legal support.\n\nAccording to the Tinchers, the Second Restatement and its derivative decisional law\n\nremains the law in Pennsylvania, and this Court rejected moving to the Third\n\nRestatement on several occasions, including after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\n\nThird Circuit predicted its adoption.\n\n       In September 2012, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment, among other\n\nthings holding that the trial court did not err in declining to adopt the Third Restatement.\n\nThe court also rejected Omega Flex’s claim of error premised upon the fireworthiness\n\ntheory, concluding that although the occurrence of lightning was arguably random and\n\ninfrequent, lightning is a naturally occurring phenomenon outside the control of the\n\nTinchers, who were using the product for its intended use. As a result, the court held\n\nthat the Tinchers’ claims implicated notions of strict liability, and the Tinchers had\n\ncarried their burden of proof under the Second Restatement and Azzarello. Moreover,\n\nthe court concluded that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedent, which\n\nremained premised upon the Second Restatement, following this Court’s then-recent\n\ndecision in Beard v. Johnson & Johnson, Inc., 41 A.3d 823 (Pa. 2012). The panel\n\nexplained that the trial court did not err in denying Omega Flex’s request to proceed in\n\naccordance with the Third Restatement because lower courts have no authority to\n\ndisapprove Supreme Court precedent.\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 16\n\f        Omega Flex filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which this Court granted,\n\nlimited to the following issue:\n\n                Whether this Court should replace the strict liability analysis\n                of Section 402A of the Second Restatement with the\n                analysis of the Third Restatement.\nIn addition, the parties were directed to brief the question of whether, if the Court were\n\nto adopt the Third Restatement, that holding should be applied prospectively or\n\nretroactively. Tincher v. Omega Flex, Inc., 64 A.3d 626 (Pa. 2013) (per curiam) (citing\n\nBugosh v. I.U. North America, Inc., 971 A.2d 1228, 1242-43 (Pa. 2009) (Saylor, J.,\n\ndissenting, joined by Castille, C.J.)).\n\n\n\n                                     II.       Arguments\n\n        Omega Flex suggests an affirmative answer to the question accepted on appeal,\n\nand further argues that this Court should disapprove the decision in Azzarello, and\n\nabandon the Second Restatement articulation of the law of strict liability in Pennsylvania\n\nin favor of the approach in the Third Restatement. The Tinchers agree that Azzarello\n\nwas wrongly decided but argue in favor of otherwise retaining the principles of liability of\n\nthe Second Restatement.\n\n        Omega Flex begins by noting that Pennsylvania recognized strict liability in 1966.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 16 (citing Webb v. Zern, 220 A.2d 853 (Pa. 1966); RESTATEMENT\n\n(2D)   OF   TORTS § 402A).    According to Omega Flex, the Second Restatement was\n\n“focused” on allegations of manufacturing defects rather than design defects and did not\n\naddress the latter “meaningfully, if at all.”         Nevertheless, Omega Flex recounts,\n\nPennsylvania and other jurisdictions have applied the Second Restatement articulation\n\nto design defects.        Omega Flex states that early applications of the Second\n\nRestatement in Pennsylvania called for a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the\n\n\n\n                                          [J-80-2013] - 17\n\fproduct, as designed, was defective or unreasonably dangerous; this approach “was\n\nsquarely in the mainstream of American tort law.” But, in 1978, according to Omega\n\nFlex, the decision in Azzarello altered the legal landscape of products liability in\n\nPennsylvania by divorcing products strict liability from principles of negligence, and by\n\ndirecting the trial court -- rather than the jury -- to make the only determination, upon a\n\nlower burden of proof, regarding the defectiveness / dangerousness of the product.\n\n       Omega Flex argues that Azzarello is theoretically unsound and unworkable in\n\npractice, suggesting that we should disapprove the decision.           Initially, Omega Flex\n\nclaims that a core principle familiar in negligence law -- reasonableness -- inherently\n\ninfuses strict liability law: a product is defective only if “unreasonably” dangerous.\n\nOmega Flex explains that a manufacturer is not the insurer of the consumer for any\n\ninjury caused by its product and may be held liable only if the product is “defective.” As\n\na practical matter, according to Omega Flex, a design is not defective “in the abstract,”\n\nas a function of the injury caused a particular plaintiff, but as a function of its risks and\n\nutilities. Omega Flex emphasizes that any product may cause injury, yet not every\n\nproduct is “defective” as that concept is properly understood in the law of strict liability --\n\nof note are inherently dangerous products such as knives and lighters. On this premise,\n\nOmega Flex suggests that the risk-utility calculus is essentially a matter of whether the\n\nmanufacturer departed from the proper and reasonable standards of care.                    “To\n\ncondemn a design for being unreasonably dangerous is inescapably to condemn the\n\ndesigner for having been negligent.”          Appellant’s Brief at 29 (citing James A.\n\nHenderson, Jr. and Aaron D. Twerski, ACHIEVING A CONSENSUS           ON   DEFECTIVE PRODUCT\n\nDESIGN, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 867, 919 (1998)). From this perspective, Omega Flex\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 18\n\fargues, the conceptual wall of separation between strict liability and negligence initially\n\narticulated by Azzarello has “no practical significance.”3\n\n       Omega Flex notes that the Azzarello Court did not purport to depart from the\n\nSecond Restatement principle that a defective design analysis is an inquiry into the care\n\nexercised by the manufacturer; the decision did not require proof of a defect separate\n\nfrom proof that the product was unreasonably dangerous. The difficulty, according to\n\nOmega Flex, is that the Court’s decision nevertheless prohibited the trial court from\n\nsubmitting to the jury the factual question of whether the product was unreasonably\n\ndangerous. Omega Flex notes that, per Azzarello, juries are instructed to determine\n\nwhether a product is defective unmoored from any inquiry into the product’s risks and\n\nutilities and the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s conduct. Omega Flex suggests\n\nthat the Azzarello approach creates an illusory separation between a product defect and\n\na manufacturer’s conduct, which constitutes a departure from the Second Restatement\n\nthe Court was purporting to follow.\n\n       Additionally, Omega Flex criticizes the Azzarello decision for relegating the risk-\n\nutility inquiry to a threshold matter of whether the defect issue may be submitted to the\n\njury, and placing that inquiry into the hands of the trial judge. Omega Flex suggests that\n\nthe Azzarello decision thereby lowers the burden on the plaintiff to prove that a product\n\n\n3\n       Omega Flex surmises that the conceptual separation and the related idea that\nthe notion of “foreseeability” has no role in a strict liability case framed the parties’\ndispute as one over whether exposure to lightning was an intended condition of using\nthe TracPipe System. The Superior Court, according to Omega Flex, focused instead\non whether the Tinchers could have avoided the harm rather than on the product,\nnecessarily injecting negligence concepts into the strict liability inquiry. Premised upon\nthese descriptions, Omega Flex emphasizes that this case reflects an “overlap” of\nnegligence principles with the proper application of strict liability law. Appellant’s Brief\nat 41.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 19\n\fis unreasonably dangerous (and, as a result, is defective). “The jury does not balance\n\nthe risk-utility factors, even though the judge has only done so as a threshold matter.”\n\nId. at 30-31 (quoting Moyer v. United Dominion Indus., Inc., 473 F.3d 532, 538-39 (3d\n\nCir. 2007)).    Omega Flex argues that Azzarello creates an anomalous process:\n\nAzzarello requires a risk-utility analysis dispositive of the claim, but prevents the jury-\n\nfactfinder from reviewing the relevant evidence and, in essence, does not permit either\n\nthe trial court or the jury to actually decide whether a product is unreasonably\n\ndangerous because its risks outweigh its benefits. “[T]rial courts are permitted to decide\n\nonly whether the evidence is sufficient to submit th[e cost-benefit] issue to the jury, but\n\nthey are prohibited from actually submitting it.” Id. at 31 (quoting John M. Thomas,\n\nDEFINING “DESIGN DEFECT”         IN   PENNSYLVANIA: RECONCILING AZZARELLO         AND   THE\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD)     OF   TORTS, 71 Temp. L. Rev. 217, 232 (1998)).4 Omega Flex\n\nnotes that this process is unique to Pennsylvania and is not supported by any reasoned\n\nauthority cited in Azzarello.\n\n       Omega Flex also comments upon the practical implications of Azzarello.\n\nAccording to Omega Flex, the central concept that negligence principles are wholly\n\nseparate from strict liability principles effectively generated minimalistic and circular\n\ninstructions for juries “which lack essential guidance concerning the key conception of\n\nproduct defect.” Id. at 34 (quoting Schmidt v. Boardman, 11 A.3d 924, 940 (Pa. 2011)).\n\nIn this case, Omega Flex notes, the trial court offered the standard Azzarello charge,\n\nwhich instructed the jury to decide whether the TracPipe System was defective without\n\n\n4\n       Omega Flex notes that this approach has the collateral effect of rendering laws,\nregulations, and industry standards irrelevant to the risk-utility inquiry, with deleterious\nand unpredictable consequences for plaintiffs and defendants. Omega Flex does not\ndevelop this assertion and, as a result, we do not address it in any detail.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 20\n\fany reference to whether the product was unreasonably dangerous.             Omega Flex\n\nargues that, absent a determination of whether the risk was unreasonable, the jury may\n\nwell have found that any risk -- including a justified risk -- rendered the TracPipe System\n\ndefective. The Azzarello instruction, Omega Flex claims, does not offer the jury any\n\nguidance as to the critical concepts of defect and whether the product is “safe for its\n\nintended use.” Moreover, Omega Flex argues that the use of the term of art “guarantor”\n\nin relation to the product, without any explanation of its meaning, misleads the jury into\n\nholding manufacturers absolutely liable for any injuries caused by the product. Omega\n\nFlex further offers that the jury’s verdict in its favor on the negligence claim here\n\nsuggests confusion of the jury with respect to the standards applicable to the strict\n\nliability claim. The Azzarello instructions, Omega Flex emphasizes, have “profoundly\n\nunfair consequences” to a manufacturer against whom design defect claims are made.\n\nId. at 35-38.\n\n       Premised upon its criticism, Omega Flex advocates that this Court should\n\ndisapprove the Azzarello decision. Omega Flex acknowledges the principle of stare\n\ndecisis but argues that the Court is not bound to perpetuate the application of unsound\n\nand unworkable precedent.       Appellant’s Brief at 41-42 (citing, inter alia, Stilp v.\n\nCommonwealth, 905 A.2d 918, 966-67 (Pa. 2006); Hack v. Hack, 433 A.2d 859, 867\n\n(Pa. 1981)). According to Omega Flex, the Azzarello limitation on the jury’s role, and\n\nthe artificial distinction between negligence and strict liability, have been controversial\n\nfrom the beginning, have no real reasoned support or practical importance, and have\n\nremained unique to Pennsylvania. Omega Flex notes that individual Justices of this\n\nCourt have already suggested that Azzarello should be disapproved. Id. at 44 (citing\n\nBugosh, 971 A.2d at 1234 (Saylor, J., dissenting, joined by Castille, C.J.), Berrier v.\n\nSimplicity Manuf., Inc., 959 A.2d 900, 901-02 (Pa. 2008) (Saylor, J., concurring, joined\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 21\n\fby Castille, C.J.); Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1012-21 (Saylor, J., concurring, joined by Castille\n\nand Eakin, JJ.)).\n\n       Next, Omega Flex suggests that, in addition to disapproving Azzarello, the Court\n\nshould adopt the approach to strict liability reflected in the Third Restatement. Omega\n\nFlex recommends the Third Restatement on the grounds that its articulation of the law is\n\nspecifically intended to address design defects and represents the current mainstream\n\nview on the topic. According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement was drafted by “two\n\nprominent product-liability scholars,” Professors James Henderson and Aaron Twerski,\n\nand was reviewed in a comprehensive process. Appellant’s Brief at 45. Omega Flex\n\ndescribes the Third Restatement as requiring, in design defect cases, a balancing of\n\nrisks and benefits by the finder of fact, upon consideration of a broad range of factors.\n\nThe critical distinction in approaches, as described by Omega Flex, is that “the plaintiff\n\ncould not simply criticize the existing design; instead, the plaintiff would be required to\n\nprove that the manufacturer could and should have adopted a reasonable alternative\n\ndesign.” Id. at 47 (citing RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2(b) cmt. d).\n\nOmega Flex argues that the Third Restatement approach is already the accepted\n\npractice in “crashworthiness” cases (as an exception to Azzarello) and is “neither\n\ninsurmountable nor unduly onerous,” permitting plaintiffs to prevail “regularly” in such\n\ncases. Id. (citing Harsh v. Petroll, 887 A.2d 209, 211 (Pa. 2005)). Citing cases from\n\nfive states, Omega Flex claims that the Third Restatement has been “widely embraced”\n\nin other jurisdictions. Id. at 48 (citing Branham v. Ford Motor Co., 701 S.E.2d 5, 16\n\n(S.C. 2010); Wright v. Brooke Grp. Ltd., 652 N.W.2d 159, 169 (Iowa 2002); Williams v.\n\nBennett, 921 So.2d 1269, 1275 (Miss. 2006); Jones v. NordicTrack, Inc., 550 S.E.2d\n\n101, 103 (Ga. 2001); Ruiz-Guzman v. Amvac Chem. Corp., 7 P.3d 795, 800 (Wash.\n\n2000)). According to Omega Flex, the Court has the opportunity in this case “to return\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 22\n\fPennsylvania to the mainstream of American tort law in strict-liability design-defect\n\ncases” by embracing the Third Restatement’s “closely reasoned and balanced\n\napproach.” Id. at 48-49 (quoting Phillips and Bugosh, supra). Premised upon these\n\narguments, Omega Flex requests a new trial on the strict liability claim conducted under\n\nthe Third Restatement approach.\n\n       The Tinchers respond that the decision of the Superior Court should be affirmed,\n\nand strict liability actions in Pennsylvania should continue to be governed by the Second\n\nRestatement.5 According to the Tinchers, establishing the liability of a manufacturer on\n\n5\n       Initially, the Tinchers suggest that the “Court should decline consideration of the\nissue [on which we granted allowance of appeal], as it is not outcome determinative,\nand affirm the lower court ruling.” According to the Tinchers, the circumstances of this\nparticular case required the Tinchers to offer evidence at trial that was sufficient to meet\nthe requirements of the Second Restatement and Azzarello, as well as the Third\nRestatement. The Tinchers argue that, as a result, “[l]iability for the defective design of\nthe TracPipe product” -- and the jury’s verdict -- “is appropriate under either\nRestatement standard.” The Tinchers claim that a judicial determination of the issue\nupon which we granted appeal would be an advisory opinion with no legal effect.\nAppellees’ Brief at 11-17.\n\n       The suggested approach is unpersuasive. The case was tried as it was tried,\nwhich was according to the Second Restatement and Azzarello. This Court granted\nallowance of appeal to address an issue of law, properly preserved and presented by\nOmega Flex, regarding the very manner in which the legal theories and options were\napportioned between court and jury, and then the issues as posed to the jury. The\nquestion of whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict is outside\nthe scope of the appeal.\n\n        Moreover, even if sufficiency of the evidence were implicated and was disputed\non appeal, this Court does not test the sufficiency of the evidence in the abstract: the\nCourt would have to engage the manner in which the Tinchers articulated their claims,\nthe theory of strict liability they pursued and, most importantly, the manner in which the\ntrial court responded and actually instructed the jury on the strict liability claim. A trial\ncourt’s charge defines the legal universe in which a jury operates for the purposes of the\nverdict. See Commonwealth v. Graham, 9 A.3d 196, 201-02 & n.9 (Pa. 2010). Yet, in\nthis argument, the Tinchers invite the Court to address whether the principles of the\nThird Restatement (a theory outside the legal universe of the jury’s task here) was an\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 23\n\fa strict liability theory is a two-step process in Pennsylvania: (1) the trial court\n\ndetermines as a threshold matter whether a product is unreasonably dangerous and, as\n\na result, whether strict liability should be submitted to the jury; and (2) the jury-factfinder\n\ndecides whether the product at issue lacks any element necessary to make it safe for its\n\nintended use -- or, is defective. The determination of whether a product is unreasonably\n\ndangerous implicates a balancing of risks and utilities. Appellees’ Brief at 19-20 (citing\n\nAzzarello, 391 A.2d at 1026).\n\n       The Tinchers posit that concepts of negligence have no place in strict liability\n\nactions, explaining that strict liability is premised upon a social policy of holding\n\nmanufacturers responsible for casting a defective product into the stream of commerce.\n\nStrict liability, the Tinchers argue, reflects a change in social policy from the principle of\n\ncaveat emptor -- buyer beware -- to the view that a supplier of products is a guarantor of\n\nits products’ safety.    The Tinchers suggest that, in the modern marketplace, the\n\nemphasis is on protecting consumers and shifting the risk of loss for injury onto\n\nsuppliers of products because suppliers are in a better position to absorb or distribute\n\nthe loss as a cost of doing business. Id. at 21 (quoting Azzarello, supra). According to\n\nthe Tinchers, twenty-five years after Azzarello, the fundamental reasons for retaining a\n\nseparation between negligence and strict liability remain, and the Second Restatement\n\nstrikes the appropriate balance. The Second Restatement, the Tinchers argue, “makes\n\nit clear that the imposition of strict liability for a product defect is not affected by the fact\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\nappropriate basis for that jury’s verdict. It would not be. See Schmidt, 11 A.3d at 944\n(“The bare litmus of sufficiency review cannot correct a fundamental error in the\ninstructions to lay jurors concerning just what it is that they are deciding.”). Accord\nAppellant’s Reply Brief at 5. Accordingly, we reject the Tinchers’ invitation to summarily\naffirm the decision of the Superior Court on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 24\n\fthat the manufacturer or other supplier has exercised ‘all possible care’”; in the\n\nTinchers’ view, the compartmentalizing of negligence and strict liability is necessary to\n\nensure that manufacturers are held responsible for their products regardless of fault. Id.\n\nat 22 (quoting Phillips, supra).\n\n       According to the Tinchers, the decision in Azzarello “represents strict liability in\n\nits purest form” because it places the emphasis on scrutinizing the product rather than\n\nthe manufacturer’s conduct. The Tinchers note that a manufacturer’s liability is limited\n\nto defective products. The Tinchers claim that “defect” is difficult to define: the critical\n\nconsideration is whether the product is unreasonably dangerous.           According to the\n\nTinchers, because the question of unreasonable dangerousness “could easily be\n\nconfused by a jury as importing concepts of negligence into a strict liability analysis,” the\n\nAzzarello Court directed that decision to the trial court rather than to the jury. The\n\ndecision, the Tinchers explain, implicates the balancing of social policies “best\n\nperformed by the [trial] court in making a determination [of] law” and acting as a gate-\n\nkeeper to prevent claims regarding certain products from reaching the jury.\n\n       The Tinchers argue that the Third Restatement abandons a pure strict liability\n\nanalysis in favor of negligence principles.       According to the Tinchers, the Third\n\nRestatement explicitly provides for consideration of “foreseeable risks of harm proposed\n\nby the product,” which is a negligence standard. The Tinchers suggest that the Third\n\nRestatement is not a “natural” and “modest” evolution of strict liability but a “calamitous”\n\ndisplacement of the social policy established by forty-seven years of Second\n\nRestatement precedent. The Tinchers argue that “[s]uch a radical departure . . . is not\n\nprudent or necessary.”\n\n       The Tinchers also note that a “clear minority” of states have adopted the Third\n\nRestatement: one state -- Iowa – expressly, and several others have adopted single\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 25\n\fsections of the Restatement or have used the doctrine as guidance for the formulation\n\nof the common law. Appellees’ Brief at 28 (citing Wright v. Brooke Group Ltd., 652\n\nN.W.2d 159 (Iowa 2002)). Other states, according to the Tinchers, have considered\n\nand explicitly declined to adopt the Third Restatement. As example, the Tinchers note\n\nthat the Supreme Court of Illinois rejected the invitation to adopt the Third Restatement\n\non the ground that any change that broadly affects public policy was best left to the\n\nlegislature. Id. at 29 (citing Mikolajczyk v. Ford Motor Co., 901 N.E.2d 329, 346 (Ill.\n\n2008)). In Connecticut, the Tinchers state, the Supreme Court explained that the Third\n\nRestatement places an undue burden of proof upon plaintiffs that might preclude valid\n\nclaims: a product may be defective and unreasonably dangerous to the user, although\n\nno feasible alternative design may be available, and a jury may infer a defect from the\n\nevidence without the necessity of expert testimony. Id. 29-30 (citing Potter v. Chicago\n\nPneumatic Tool Co., 694 A.2d 1319, 1332 (Conn. 1997); TRW Vehicle Safety Sys., Inc.\n\nv. Moore, 936 N.E.2d 201 (Ind. 2010); Halliday v. Sturm, Ruger & Co., 792 A.2d 1145\n\n(Md. 2002); Vautour v. Body Masters Sports Indus., Inc., 784 A.2d 1178 (N.H. 2001);\n\nGreen v. Smith & Nephew AHP, Inc., 629 N.W.2d 727 (Wis. 2001); Delaney v. Deere &\n\nCo., 999 P.2d 930 (Kan. 2000); Rodriguez v. Suzuki Motor Corp., 996 S.W.2d 47 (Mo.\n\n1999); Sternhagen v. Dow Co., 935 P.2d 1139 (Mont. 1997)).\n\n       The Tinchers claim that Omega Flex erroneously relies upon cases implicating\n\nthe “crashworthiness” exception to general products liability theory under the Second\n\nRestatement.    This exception, according to the Tinchers, is accepted as such in\n\n“virtually every [U.S.] jurisdiction” and is typically applied to cases in which an alleged\n\ndefect did not cause the automobile accident or initial impact, but served to increase the\n\nseverity of the injury. The Tinchers argue that “crashworthiness” doctrine cases offer no\n\nindication that a jurisdiction has embraced the alternative design requirements of the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 26\n\fThird Restatement. Appellees’ Brief at 31 (citing Patrick Lavelle, CRASHING INTO PROOF\n\nOF A   REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE DESIGN; THE FALLACY        OF THE   RESTATEMENT (THIRD)   OF\n\nTORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY, 38 Duq. L. Rev. 1059, 1098-99 (2000)).            The Tinchers\n\nmaintain that any suggestion -- including in the reporters’ commentary to Section 2(b) --\n\nthat the Third Restatement standards are widely accepted is inaccurate and misleading\n\nbecause it is simply premised upon cases addressing the crashworthiness doctrine\n\nexception. Id. at 32 (citing RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2(b) cmt.\n\nd & nn. II-A, II-C (1997)).\n\n        Finally, the Tinchers argue that the Third Restatement would accomplish a\n\n“radical departure” from existing public policy because it would impose “an undue\n\nhardship on plaintiffs in the pursuit of meritorious claims.” According to the Tinchers,\n\nthe Third Restatement shifts the emphasis from the existing product to speculation of\n\nwhat similar product could have been designed.           In the Tinchers’ view, the Third\n\nRestatement represents “an instrument of tort reform” rather than an articulation of\n\nexisting law, which will impose a prohibitive cost on plaintiffs and counsel to produce\n\nalternative designs in the pursuit of otherwise meritorious claims. Id. at 33-34 (citing\n\nGary Wilson et al, THE FUTURE   OF   PRODUCTS LIABILITY   IN   AMERICA, 27 Wm. Mitchell L.\n\nRev. 85, 99-100 (2000); Frank J. Vandall and Joshua F. Vandall, A CALL             FOR AN\n\nACCURATE RESTATEMENT (THIRD)     OF   TORTS: DESIGN DEFECT, 33 U. Mem. L. Rev. 909,\n\n923 (2003)).     The Third Restatement, according to the Tinchers, is a boon to\n\nmanufacturers by placing at a “tremendous disadvantage” injured consumers who\n\nwould necessarily have to become experts and seek to redesign the product that\n\ncaused the injury; the cost of this exercise may exceed the benefit of a recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the Tinchers argue that the attendant costs of representing an injured\n\nplaintiff in a Third Restatement jurisdiction would discourage counsel from representing\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 27\n\finjured consumers. The Tinchers suggest that application of the Third Restatement\n\nwould vitiate the public policy upon which products liability law is premised, i.e., of\n\nholding manufacturers liable for defects in products placed in the stream of commerce;\n\nmanufacturers are in a better position to absorb the costs of injuries than are individual\n\nconsumers.\n\n       In an alternative argument, the Tinchers suggest that the Court could disapprove\n\nAzzarello but continue to apply the Second Restatement rather than the Third\n\nRestatement articulation of the law. The Tinchers note that this resolution of the matter\n\nwould protect the social policies underlying products liability yet remove any difficulties\n\ncaused by the decision in Azzarello.      See Appellees’ Brief at 41 n.16.       Ultimately,\n\nhowever, the Tinchers ask the Court to affirm the decision of the Superior Court.\n\n       In reply, Omega Flex reiterates its position that the differences between the\n\nSecond Restatement and the Third Restatement are modest; the difficulty with\n\nPennsylvania’s approach to products liability instead results from the application of\n\nAzzarello. Omega Flex suggests that the Tinchers do not oppose a disposition of this\n\nappeal in which the Court would disapprove Azzarello, although the parties disagree\n\nwhether the Court should go further and adopt the Third Restatement. With regard to\n\nthe Third Restatement, Omega Flex argues that the “reasonable alternative design”\n\nelement of proof does not erect the types of insurmountable barriers to meritorious\n\nclaims that the Tinchers portray: plaintiffs may adduce proof of existing products (i.e.,\n\npredecessor products or competitor products) or no expert proof at all if the feasibility of\n\nan alternative design is obvious and understandable to lay persons. Appellant’s Reply\n\nBrief at 20 (citing RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. f). Omega\n\nFlex presents the Third Restatement as a refinement of its predecessor with specific\n\nprovisions for design defects, whose approach has already been accepted in the form of\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 28\n\fnumerous exceptions to the general Second Restatement rules. Moreover, Omega\n\nFlex claims that, contrary to the Tinchers’ representations, adherence to the Second\n\nRestatement view has become the minority position. Omega Flex concludes that the\n\ncase should be retried before a jury properly instructed, and the instruction should be\n\npremised upon the Third Restatement.\n\n\n\n                                    III.   Analysis\n\n                      A.     The Scope and Standard of Review\n\n      As a preliminary matter, we observe that the parties pose and argue a seemingly\n\npristine question of law, little dependent on the facts of record, primarily regarding\n\nwhether this Court should replace the strict liability analysis of the Second Restatement\n\nwith the analysis of the Third Restatement. In part, this is a function of how the issues\n\nwere presented to the lower courts and of the lower courts’ recognition that the question\n\nof whether to “move” to the Third Restatement has been a matter of debate and\n\nspeculation in interested legal circles and in federal court cases (as well as in separate\n\nopinions in this Court); all recognize that, as a common law matter, the decision of\n\nwhether to adopt principles from the Third Restatement would ultimately be made by\n\nthis Court. As a result of this background circumstance, the lower courts offered no\n\nprincipled assessment or practical perspective regarding the core, and strictly legal,\n\npositions now presented by the parties to this Court. While the importance of lower\n\ncourts’ analysis of a proposed change in the law as applied to the facts of a particular\n\ncase and the centrality of such analysis to the development of the common law cannot\n\nbe understated, we note, nevertheless, that there is no suggestion by either party that\n\nthe issue so presented was waived. See Scampone v. Highland Park Care Center,\n\nLLC, 57 A.3d 582, 604-05 (Pa. 2012) (judicial determinations to be read against facts);\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 29\n\fSchmidt, 11 A.3d at 941-42 (listing considerations relevant on appeal to presentation\n\nand preservation of challenges to prevailing precedent). Accordingly, we proceed to a\n\nreview of the merits of the parties’ dispute.\n\n       Properly framed, then, the question before the Court is whether Omega Flex was\n\nentitled to relief, in the form of judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial,\n\npremised upon its argument that the jury should have been instructed on the law\n\nrepresented by the Third Restatement. The relevant facts are not in dispute and the\n\nissue posed is one of law. Accordingly, our review of the Superior Court’s decision is\n\nplenary and de novo. Walnut Street Assocs., Inc. v. Brokerage Concepts, Inc., 20 A.3d\n\n468, 474-75 (Pa. 2011).\n\n       This Court has explained that, “[w]hen a court instructs the jury, the objective is\n\nto explain to the jury how it should approach its task and the factors it should consider in\n\nreaching its verdict.” On appeal, this Court examines jury instructions to determine\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion or offered an inaccurate statement of law\n\ncontrolling the outcome of the case. A jury charge is adequate “unless the issues are\n\nnot made clear, the jury was misled by the instructions, or there was an omission from\n\nthe charge amounting to a fundamental error.” Commonwealth v. Chambers, 980 A.2d\n\n35, 49-50 (Pa. 2009); see also Price v. Guy, 735 A.2d 668, 670 (Pa. 1999). This Court\n\nwill afford a new trial if an erroneous jury instruction amounted to a fundamental error or\n\nthe record is insufficient to determine whether the error affected the verdict. See, e.g.,\n\nPrice, 735 A.2d at 672.\n\n       Meanwhile, greater relief in the form of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is\n\nappropriate only if the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, i.e., if the\n\nevidence presented at trial was such that no two reasonable minds could disagree that\n\nthe verdict should be in favor of the movant. Degenhardt v. Dillon Co., 669 A.2d 946,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 30\n\f950 (Pa. 1996) (citing Boettger v. Miklich, 633 A.2d 1146, 1148 n.2 (Pa. 1993)). An\n\naward of judgment notwithstanding the verdict “is appropriate only if, reading the record\n\nin the light most favorable to [the verdict winner], and affording [the verdict winner] the\n\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences, we would conclude that there is insufficient\n\ncompetent evidence to sustain the verdict.” General Services, 898 A.2d at 604.\n\n       The parties’ present dispute implicates foundational notions in the law of strict\n\nliability. To decide the dispute, we necessarily address: (1) what evidence is sufficient\n\nunder Pennsylvania law to prove a claim of strict liability in tort; (2) the proper role of the\n\ntrial judge; and (3) the appropriate manner of instructing the jury. As we will explain,\n\nthese questions can be further complicated by the particulars of the tort, or the product,\n\nat issue.\n\n       Furthermore, central to the parties’ dispute are questions of whether this Court\n\nshould disapprove the 1978 decision in Azzarello, and whether the Court should\n\nabandon the Second Restatement articulation of the strict liability cause of action and,\n\nin its place, “adopt” as the law of Pennsylvania the Third Restatement formulation of\n\nstrict liability in tort. These questions implicate separate foundational principles of stare\n\ndecisis and judicial restraint.\n\n       The doctrine of stare decisis “commands judicial respect for prior decisions of\n\nthis Court and the legal rules contained in those decisions.” Stilp, 905 A.2d at 954 n.31;\n\nsee also Kendrick v. District Attorney of Philadelphia County, 916 A.2d 529, 539 (Pa.\n\n2007). The Court honors the stare decisis doctrine to ensure “evenhanded, predictable,\n\nand consistent development of legal principles, foster[] reliance on judicial decisions,\n\nand contribute[] to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Stilp, 905\n\nA.2d at 954 n.31. But, the Court’s general faithfulness to precedent is not sufficient\n\njustification to buttress judicial decisions proven wrong in principle or “which are\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 31\n\funsuited to modern experience and which no longer adequately serve the interests of\n\njustice.” In re Carney, 79 A.3d 490, 505 (Pa. 2013); Ayala v. Philadelphia Bd. of Public\n\nEd., 305 A.2d 877, 888 (Pa. 1973) (quoting Griffith v. United Air Lines, Inc., 203 A.2d\n\n796, 806 (Pa. 1964)). In this sense, we have long recognized that the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis is not a vehicle for perpetuating error, but “a legal concept which responds to the\n\ndemands of justice and, thus, permits the orderly growth processes of the law to\n\nflourish.” Pa. State Ass’n of County Comm’rs v. Commonwealth, 52 A.3d 1213, 1230\n\n(Pa. 2012) (quoting Buckwalter v. Bor. of Phoenixville, 985 A.2d 728, 730-31 (Pa.\n\n2009)). Common law permits adjustment and development in the law, recognizing that\n\nprecedent is not infallible and judicial honesty demands corrective action in appropriate\n\ncases.    See Ayala, 305 A.2d at 888 (quoting Olin Mathieson C. Corp. v. White C.\n\nStores, 199 A.2d 266, 268 (Pa. 1964)).\n\n         We have recently stressed in multiple cases that the common law “develops\n\nincrementally, within the confines of the circumstances of cases as they come before\n\nthe Court.” Scampone, 57 A.3d at 604 (quoting Maloney v. Valley Med. Facilities, Inc.,\n\n984 A.2d 478, 489–90 (Pa. 2009)). Causes of action at common law evolve through\n\neither directly applicable decisional law or by analogy and distinction. Id.; accord City of\n\nPhiladelphia v. Cumberland County Bd. of Assessment Appeals, 81 A.3d 24, 54 (Pa.\n\n2013). Among the duties of courts is “to give efficacy to the law . . . and though they\n\ncannot make laws, they may mould the forms of the ancient laws to the exigency of the\n\nnew case.” Reed v. Garvin’s Executors, 1821 WL 1898 at *7 (Pa. 1821). Notably, its\n\nequitable powers afford the Court the authority to modify the common law forms of\n\naction to the right involved, rather than limiting the authority to testing the right by the\n\nforms of action. See Kase v. Kase, 34 Pa. 128, 1859 WL 8779 at *4 (Pa. 1859). See\n\nalso PA. CONST. art. V, § 10(c) (Supreme Court has power “to prescribe general rules\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 32\n\fgoverning practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts . . . if such rules are\n\nconsistent with this Constitution and neither abridge, enlarge nor modify the substantive\n\nrights of any litigant. . . .”); e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No. 1001(b) (“There shall be a civil action in\n\nwhich “shall be brought all claims for relief heretofore asserted in (1) the action for\n\nassumpsit, (2) the action of trespass, and (3) the action in equity”).\n\n       Reliance upon the inherent and necessary flexibility of common law rules does\n\nnot provide, however, the dispositive answer to the question of whether “adoption” of\n\nthe American Law Institute’s new formulation for tort law is appropriate or advisable.\n\nThis Court has grown more careful over the years when presented with invitations to\n\nissue broad-based pronouncements in areas where it is apparent that such\n\npronouncements are better suited to the information-gathering and give-and-take\n\nbalancing of competing concerns available in the legislative arena. Thus, for example, it\n\nis difficult to imagine a modern court simply adopting something so broad-based and\n\nlegislative in character as an outside organization’s Restatement of the Law, even if it is\n\nthe product of an esteemed organization.         That being said, the fact is that, in this\n\nparticular area of the law, the Court has played a major developmental role; and when\n\nan issue is properly joined in a case, we are of course duty-bound to resolution and\n\nexplication of the matter. And, in this process, while the line of demarcation between\n\nadvancing or correcting the common law -- or, perhaps, accounting for nuance not\n\nadvanced, perceived, or predicted in the crucible of prior cases -- and a foray into\n\nlegislative policy-making is a gray area, some principles governing decision are readily\n\napparent.\n\n       The first principle applies generally and involves the policy-making authority of\n\nthe General Assembly. In considering whether a long-established common law rule is\n\nout of step with modern experience, we assume that the General Assembly is aware of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 33\n\fthe rule, which, if unchanged by legislation, presumably reflects continued legislative\n\npolicy. See Everhart v. PMA Ins. Group, 938 A.2d 301, 307 (Pa. 2007). Of course,\n\n“[t]here is not a rule of the common law in force today that has not evolved from some\n\nearlier rule of common law, gradually in some instances, more suddenly in others,\n\nleaving the common law of today when compared with the common law of centuries ago\n\nas different as day is from night.” Hack, 433 A.2d at 868-69. Change is more often\n\ngradual because a court seldom is in possession of sufficient information concerning all\n\nrelevant factors to justify support of a rule of general application inconsistent with the\n\nexisting common law formulation of the tort.        See Official Comm. of Unsecured\n\nCreditors of Allegheny Health Educ. & Research Found. v. PriceWaterhouseCoopers,\n\nLLP, 989 A.2d 313, 332-33 (Pa. 2010). “[C]ommon-law decision-making is subject to\n\ninherent limitations, as it is grounded in records of individual cases and the advocacy by\n\nthe parties shaped by those records. Unlike the legislative process, the adjudicatory\n\nprocess is structured to cast a narrow focus on matters framed by litigants before the\n\nCourt in a highly directed fashion.” Id. Consistency with the general rule permits the\n\nCourt to benefit from the honed sensibilities and accumulated wisdom of the rule’s\n\napplication in a myriad of individual cases.\n\n       Two other considerations are specific to the nature and recognized role of a\n\n“Restatement” of law in the development of Pennsylvania common law. Restatements\n\nof law published by the American Law Institute purport to offer a synthesis of American\n\ncommon law, which articulates the reasoned, mainstream, modern consensus on\n\nprinciples of broad application intended to govern large numbers of cases. Scampone,\n\n57 A.3d at 606; see also Coyle v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc., 584 A.2d 1383, 1385 (Pa.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 34\n\f1991).6 Consistent with its adjudicative rather than policy-making role, the Court has\n\n“adopted” or deemed sections of a restatement a proper statement of Pennsylvania law\n\nif the cause of action and its contours are consistent with the nature of the tort and\n\nPennsylvania’s traditional common law formulation. See, e.g., Scampone, 57 A.3d at\n\n606; Walnut Street Assocs., 20 A.3d at 478-79; Bilt-Rite Contractors, Inc. v. The\n\nArchitectural Studio, 866 A.2d 270, 285 (Pa. 2005). In this sense, the adoption of a\n\nrestatement formulation intended to advance the law cannot be so unmoored from\n\nexisting common law and produce such a policy shift that it amounts in actuality or\n\npublic perception to a derogation of legislative authority, and the concomitant\n\nsuggestion that such authority is reposed in the Judiciary or in the American Law\n\nInstitute.   Consistent with this principle, the Court must generally show restraint in\n\n6\n       The Institute is a non-profit organization of 4000 lawyers, judges, and law\nprofessors, established to produce scholarly work to clarify, modernize, and otherwise\nimprove the law. Among other tasks, the Institute drafts, discusses, revises, and\npublishes Restatements of the Law.\n\n       The parties here, and several commentators, have engaged in a debate over\nwhether the Third Restatement of Torts, Products Liability, does indeed articulate the\nmodern consensus in the area of strict liability. Some commentators have questioned\nwhether the reporters of the Third Restatement favored an industry viewpoint in their\ntask. Compare Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 867 (reporters defend process of drafting\nThird Restatement) with John F. Vargo, THE EMPEROR’S NEW CLOTHES: THE AMERICAN\nLAW INSTITUTE ADORNS A “NEW CLOTH” FOR SECTION 402A PRODUCTS LIABILITY DESIGN\nDEFECTS -- A SURVEY OF THE STATES REVEALS A DIFFERENT W EAVE, 26 U. Mem. L. Rev.\n493 (1996) (criticizing drafting process of Third Restatement, surveying law in fifty\nstates, and cataloguing several approaches to strict liability). As an institution, this\nCourt is not particularly equipped to resolve such disputes, and in light of our\ndisposition, we find it unnecessary to engage the debate. But see, e.g., Halliday v.\nSturm, Ruger & Co., Inc., 792 A.2d 1145, 1159 (Md. 2002) (in light of ongoing\ncontroversy, declining to “cast aside” existing jurisprudence in favor of broad application\nof Third Restatement’s risk-utility standard). The fact of the debate, however, is a\nreminder of the imperative of judicial modesty in passing upon a request to “adopt” a\nRestatement wholesale.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 35\n\faltering existing allocations of risk created by long-tenured common law rules and resist\n\nthe temptation of experimentation with untested social policies, especially where the\n\nindividual record and the advocacy of the parties in the context of that record offer little\n\nmore than abstract justifications. Thus, the Court is not in a position to upend risks and\n\nexpectations premised upon broad-based arguments calling for a judgment about\n\nsocially acceptable economic incentives; the legislative setting is a preferable forum for\n\nsuch an endeavor. See City of Philadelphia, 81 A.3d at 55; accord Pegram v. Herdrich,\n\n530 U.S. 211, 221-22 (2000) (“[C]omplicated factfinding and . . . debatable social\n\njudgment are not wisely required of courts unless for some reason resort cannot be had\n\nto the legislative process, with its preferable forum for comprehensive investigations and\n\njudgments of social value. . . .”); Kristen David Adams, THE FOLLY         OF   UNIFORMITY?\n\nLESSONS FROM THE RESTATEMENT MOVEMENT, 33 Hofstra L. Rev. 423 (2004) (assessing\n\neffect of employing restatement as default common law in Virgin Islands).\n\n       Moreover, because the language of a provision of the restatement, even to the\n\nextent it was adopted by the Court verbatim, has not been vetted through the crucible of\n\nthe legislative process, a court applying the restatement formulation should betray\n\nawareness that the language of an “adopted” restatement provision is not “considered\n\ncontrolling in the manner of a statute.”     A given restatement section simply states\n\nprinciples of the common law, general rules whose validity depends on the reasoning\n\nthat supports them. Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1385. As with any other common law rules, the\n\nnormative principles of an “adopted” section of a restatement are properly tested\n\nagainst the facts of each case. “For one thing, it is very difficult for courts to determine\n\nthe range of factual circumstances to which a particular rule should apply in light of the\n\noften myriad possibilities”; of particular concern is “the possibility that words or phrases\n\nor sentences may be taken out of context and treated as doctrines.” Maloney, 984 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 36\n\fat 489–90. In this regard, we underscore the importance of avoiding formulaic reading\n\nof common law principles and “wooden application of abstract principles to\n\ncircumstances in which different considerations may pertain.” Scampone, 57 A.3d at\n\n605 (citing Maloney, 984 A.2d at 485-86). Thus, as to any particular claim in a disputed\n\nmatter, a court should consider whether the application is logical and serves the\n\ninterests of justice, and whether the general principle has been accepted elsewhere.7\n\n“[T]he court always retains the right and the duty to test the reason behind a common\n\nlaw rule in determining the applicability of such rule to the facts before it. In the face of\n\ncontrary arguments as to why the rule should not apply in a given case, it is not enough\n\nto say merely that the rule as stated contains no exceptions.” Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1385.\n\nStated otherwise, “[w]here the facts of a case demonstrate that the rule outruns the\n\nreason, the court has the power, indeed the obligation, to refuse to apply the rule, a\n\npower for the most part unavailable where the rule is legislatively ordained.” Id.\n\n\n\n               B.     Strict Liability in Pennsylvania: the Common Law\n\n       In the arena of strict liability, this Court does not write on a blank slate; the\n\ncommon law is the starting point of our explication of the conceptual framework for strict\n\n\n7\n        Consideration for whether the general principle has been accepted elsewhere\nreflects the understanding that the restatement purports to represent the majority view\non the subject in the United States. See Adams, 33 Hofstra L. Rev. at 443-44. But,\nquestions remain subject to dispute regarding the “essential nature of the modern\nRestatements” and whether uniformity among jurisdictions is necessary and wise. See\ngenerally Vargo, 26 U. Mem. L. Rev. at 515-36 (describing internal criticism of some\nthat membership of American Law Institute drafting Third Restatement “[wa]s largely\ncomprised of those who represent[ed] corporate interests” and who “fail[ed] to leave the\nclient at the door”); and see Adams, 33 Hofstra L. Rev. at 443-44 (offering argument\nthat “fit” for jurisdiction that shapes common law “is more important than uniformity”\namong American jurisdictions).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 37\n\fliability in tort in Pennsylvania. The evolution of strict liability jurisprudence has four\n\ndistinct, relevant periods: early cases addressing the evolution of strict liability and the\n\nadoption of the Second Restatement’s articulation of the cause of action; the advent of\n\nAzzarello; post-Azzarello jurisprudence; and recent judicial expressions addressing the\n\nThird Restatement.\n\n       At the outset, we note that disputes over liability for personal and economic harm\n\ncaused by products, although perhaps not articulated in those same terms, likely\n\naccompanied the earliest division of labor. Efficiency, specialization, and the evolution\n\nof expertise, separately and as precursors to invention and innovation, were significant\n\nbenefits of this division of labor.8    But, the same division of labor, especially in its\n\nincreasingly complex permutations, caused a physical and moral separation between\n\nsellers and buyers that inevitably generated disputes. The resolution of these disputes\n\nin English and American jurisdictions over the several centuries created a rich body of\n\nexperience-based common sensibilities and wisdom from which the modern principles\n\n\n8\n       David Hume said of the “partition of employments”:\n\n                     When every individual person labours a-part, and only\n              for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable\n              work; his labour being employ’d in supplying all his different\n              necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular\n              art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal,\n              the least failure in either of these particulars must be\n              attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a\n              remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction\n              of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of\n              employments, our ability [in]creases: And by mutual succor\n              we are less expos’d to fortune and accidents. ’Tis by this\n              additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes\n              advantageous.\n\nDavid Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature (1739).\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 38\n\fof the common law of products liability evolved. Review of decisional law illustrates a\n\ngeneral trend of gradual expansion of civil liability for harm to persons or property; as it\n\nhappens, whether a particular development occurred in the context of injury caused by\n\na product or not, the principles of liability were generally articulated in broad terms\n\napplicable to products. Compare, e.g., Breckbill v. Lancaster Turnpike Co., 3 U.S. 496,\n\n499 (1799) (action for implied assumpsit (i.e., breach of implied contract) cannot be\n\nmaintained because corporation can only contract by deed under corporate seal) with\n\nBank of Columbia v.

See William L. Prosser, THE ASSAULT UPON                  THE   CITADEL\n\n(STRICT LIABILITY TO    THE   CONSUMER), 69 Yale L. J. 1099, 1103-10 (1960) (citing, inter\n\nalia, Caskie v.

Prosser was the Dean of the School of Law at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, from 1948 to 1961 and a senior authority in the publication of the\ncase law book “Prosser, Wade and Schwartz’s Torts, Cases and Materials.”\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 40\n\fwholesome and fit for purpose intended, irrespective of seller’s knowledge of disease or\n\ndefects therein; “prima facie case is made out by proof that the meat sold by defendant\n\nwas diseased and caused the death of plaintiff’s husband”)). Redress for injury caused\n\nby   other   products   was    available      in    tort    (by   asserting,   e.g.,   negligence,\n\nmisrepresentation, or fraud claims) or by asserting breach of warranty claims. These\n\ncauses of action, and their attendant respective forms of pleading, remain available to\n\nplaintiffs today, forming the greater body of products liability law. Accord Lance, 85\n\nA.3d at 440 n.8.\n\n       By the 1960s, plaintiffs had sought to establish liability of sellers of products\n\nprimarily via actions in negligence and breach of warranty, on the assumption that these\n\nrecognized causes of action provided the best approximation of justice in individual\n\ncases then available. Negligence, in tort, spoke to the notion of redress for a legal\n\nwrong or direct and forcible injury to the person, land, or chattels of another. See R.F.V.\n\nHeuston, SALMOND    ON THE    LAW   OF   TORTS 4 (17th ed. 1977). Negligence theory also\n\noffered the convenience that it did not require proof of knowledge of a particular defect\n\nin the product, but simply the failure to exercise due care had the defect been\n\nforeseeable. Meanwhile, a breach of warranty action, sounding in assumpsit, was at its\n\norigin an action in tort, which “transformed into an action of contract, becoming\n\nafterwards a remedy where there was neither tort nor contract.” James Barr Ames, The\n\nHistory of Assumpsit in 3 SELECT ESSAYS            IN   ANGLO-AMERICAN LEGAL HISTORY 1, 298\n\n(1909). The word assumpsit suggested the making of a promise and, originally, the\n\nactionable conduct was the breach of an express promise.                   The cause of action\n\nevolved, however, to encompass the breach of an implied promise, and even of a\n\nfictitious promise. See id. (commenting upon “assumpsit” as illustration of “the flexibility\n\nand power of self-development of the Common Law”). “[W]arranty (unlike negligence\n\n\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 41\n\fwhich is a tort concept based on fault) is not a concept based on fault or on the failure to\n\nexercise reasonable care.       But this does not mean that warranty is necessarily\n\ncontractual or non-tortious in nature.     Liability in warranty arises where damage is\n\ncaused by the failure of a product to measure up to express or implied representations\n\non the part of the manufacturer or other supplier. Accordingly, an injured person is not\n\nrequired to prove negligence in a warranty-products liability case.” Putman v. Erie City\n\nMfg. Co., 338 F.2d 911, 913 n.8 (5th Cir. 1964) (quoting Frumer and Friedman § 16A p.\n\n358). Elements of both the negligence and breach of warranty causes of action, as they\n\nhad thus developed, foreshadowed the evolution of jurisprudence in the area of strict\n\nliability, and increasingly resonated with courts.\n\n\n\n                 1.     The Second Restatement and the Early Cases\n\n       Early decisional law in Pennsylvania explained the genesis and nature of the\n\nstrict liability cause of action, with reference to Section 402A of the Second\n\nRestatement. Section 402A of the Second Restatement states:\n\n                    § 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for\n              Physical Harm to User or Consumer\n\n                     (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition\n              unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his\n              property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby\n              caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\n                     (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling\n              such a product, and\n                     (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or\n              consumer without substantial change in the condition in\n              which it is sold.\n\n                    (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although\n                    (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the\n              preparation and sale of his product, and\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 42\n\f                     (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product\n               from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A (1965).\n\n        The commentary to the Second Restatement traces the roots of the higher\n\ndegree of responsibility placed upon sellers of goods to English criminal statutes of the\n\nThirteenth Century that imposed penalties upon persons who supplied “corrupt food and\n\ndrink.” RESTATEMENT (2D)     OF   TORTS § 402A cmt. b. As these criminal statutes were\n\nrepealed, judicial decisions referred in dicta to the civil liability of sellers to those to\n\nwhom they sold “corrupt victuals.” See Prosser, 69 Yale L.J. at 1104. Early American\n\njurisprudence denominated the special civil responsibility as “warranty,” imposed upon\n\nthe seller of food in favor of the direct purchaser. At the beginning of the Twentieth\n\nCentury, judicial decisions extended sellers’ “strict liability” beyond the direct purchaser\n\nto injured consumers. Id. The decisions articulated an exception to the general rule of\n\nmore direct liability premised upon proof of negligence or privity of contract. “In the\n\nbeginning, these decisions displayed considerable ingenuity in evolving more or less\n\nfictitious theories of liability to fit the case. The various devices included an agency of\n\nthe intermediate dealer or another to purchase for the consumer, or to sell for the seller;\n\na theoretical assignment of the seller’s warranty to the intermediate dealer; a third party\n\nbeneficiary contract; and an implied representation that the food was fit for consumption\n\nbecause it was placed on the market, as well as numerous others.” RESTATEMENT (2D)\n\nOF   TORTS § 402A cmt. b. Later jurisprudence settled upon a theory of warranty “running\n\nwith the goods” or made directly to the consumer; the alternative was strict liability in\n\ntort. After 1950, jurisdictions extended the rule of strict liability beyond the sale of food\n\nfor human consumption, to other products intended for intimate bodily use. Finally, in\n\nthe late 1950s, courts began applying these developed rules of strict liability to the sale\n\nof any product. Id.; see also Prosser, 69 Yale L.J. at 1103-14 (stating, inter alia, that\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 43\n\fPennsylvania had extended application of a heightened responsibility to sellers of\n\nproducts other than food in Jarnot v. Ford Motor Co., 156 A.2d 569 (Pa. Super. 1959),\n\npremised upon misconstruction of language in earlier cases).\n\n       In 1966, this Court took a major step by “adopting” the formulation of Section\n\n402A of the Second Restatement of Torts as the common law of Pennsylvania. In\n\nWebb, 220 A.2d 853, the Court vacated the trial court’s order to dismiss the case and\n\nremanded with instructions for the trial court to permit the plaintiff to amend his\n\ncomplaint to add a cause of action premised upon the theory of strict liability in tort as\n\narticulated by the Second Restatement. The plaintiff in Webb had been severely injured\n\nwhen a beer keg exploded and, as a result, filed a complaint “in trespass,” asserting an\n\n“exclusive control” theory of negligence -- essentially res ipsa loquitur, see, e.g., Loch v.\n\nConfair, 93 A.2d 451 (Pa. 1953) -- against the beer distributor, the brewer who had filled\n\nthe keg, and the manufacturer of the keg.           The trial court sustained preliminary\n\nobjections, reasoning that the plaintiff had not joined in the suit before the expiration of\n\nthe statute of limitations all parties against whom an inference of negligence could be\n\ndrawn, i.e., the plaintiff’s father, who had purchased the keg, and the plaintiff’s brother,\n\nwho had tapped the keg. On appeal, the Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Cohen,\n\noffered little explanation of its reasoning for formally adopting the Second Restatement\n\nexcept by reference to the responsive opinions of Messrs. Justice Jones and Roberts in\n\nMiller v. Preitz, 221 A.2d 320 (Pa. 1966), filed in a companion decision entered the\n\nsame day as Webb. The relevant reasoning of the Webb Court in its entirety reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n                       We need not, however, determine whether or not the\n              lower court erred with regard to the law of exclusive control,\n              for there is another and clearer issue which is determinative\n              of this appeal. That issue is the nature and scope of the\n              liability in trespass of one who produces or markets a\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 44\n\f              defective product for use or consumption. The development\n              of the law in that area is chronicled in the Concurring and\n              Dissenting Opinions of Justices Jones and Roberts to the\n              decision of this Court in Miller v. Preitz, 221 A.2d 320 (Pa.\n              1966). One will also find there citations to modern case law\n              and commentaries which extend and recommend the\n              extension of the law of strict liability in tort for defective\n              products. The new Restatement of Torts reflects this\n              modern attitude. Section 402A thereof states: [Quoting in\n              full Section 402A of the Second Restatement.]\n\n                    We hereby adopt the foregoing language as the law\n              of Pennsylvania.\n\n                    The plaintiff in this litigation, therefore, must be given\n              an opportunity to plead and prove his case. . . .\n220 A.2d at 854.     Mr. Justice Eagen filed a joining concurring opinion, noting his\n\npreference for a limited application of the Second Restatement. Mr. Chief Justice Bell\n\nfiled a dissenting opinion. See n.10 infra.\n\n       The several opinions filed in Miller offer substantially more insight than Webb into\n\nthe genesis of the strict liability tort in Pennsylvania and the Court’s decision to adopt\n\nthe Second Restatement to define its parameters. The Miller plaintiff was the estate\n\nadministrator of a deceased infant, who was fatally injured when a vaporizer-humidifier\n\nused to relieve congestion in his nose shot boiling water on his body. The plaintiff filed\n\na complaint asserting a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability against the\n\nmanufacturer, the distributor, and the retail pharmacy that had sold the vaporizer-\n\nhumidifier to the deceased infant’s aunt. The infant had used the product in the aunt’s\n\nhome, next door to his family’s home.         In relevant part, the trial court sustained\n\npreliminary objections to the complaint, on the ground that the implied warranty did not\n\nextend to the deceased infant because he had not been in privity of contract with any of\n\nthe defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 45\n\f       The Miller Court reversed the judgment as a matter of law entered in favor of a\n\nretailer because the deceased infant, who was harmed by the vaporizer-humidifier sold\n\nby the retailer, was “in the buyer’s family” and, notwithstanding the infant’s lack of privity\n\nwith the retailer, his representative had met the prerequisites for pursuing a breach of\n\nwarranty action under the plain language of the Uniform Commercial Code.                  (By\n\ncomparison, the Webb plaintiff had pursued an action in tort on a theory of negligence.)\n\nAdditionally, the Miller Court affirmed the judgment in favor of the manufacturer and of\n\nthe distributor, reasoning that the Code’s provisions did not extend warranty liability to\n\nremote sellers in the chain of distribution. Id. at 324 (citing 12A P.S. § 2-318). In both\n\nrespects, according to the Court, the language of the Uniform Commercial Code was\n\ndispositive. The Miller Court viewed abandoning the requirement of privity in warranty\n\nactions as unnecessary, noting the expectation that strict liability in tort would vindicate\n\npublic policy relating to products liability and accomplished a similar result to\n\nabandoning privity.\n\n       Justice Jones concurred in the decision to reverse the judgment against the\n\nretailer, but dissented from the Court’s disposition with respect to the manufacturer and\n\ndistributor of the product. The dissent was premised in part upon the view that, if the\n\nCourt retained the requirement of privity, the Court should adopt the Second\n\nRestatement and thereby relegate all actions in the products liability field to tort. The\n\ndissent described the state of the law then existing:\n\n                     In the field of product liability, resort for redress for\n              injury arising from a defective product may be had either in\n              tort or assumpsit. In [Loch v. Confair, 63 A.2d 24 (Pa.\n              1949)], we said “that a person who has effected the\n              purchase of particular goods and sustains injury because of\n              unfitness for an intended purpose may institute an action in\n              assumpsit based upon a breach of implied warranty Or an\n              action in trespass based upon specific averments of\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 46\n\f             negligence. In both instances the elements of damage may\n             be identical, viz, the damage naturally and proximately\n             resulting from a breach of implied warranty or a breach of\n             duty. . . . An election of remedies in this regard has,\n             however, never been held by this Court to authorize\n             institution of a contract action based upon averments of\n             negligence. Nor, conversely, has it authorized institution of a\n             negligence action based upon averments of contract.\n             Essential distinctions which exist have been recognized.”\n             [63 A.2d at 26]. Thus, while a person injured by a defective\n             product has an election of remedies, however, each remedy\n             has acquired distinct characteristics.\n221 A.2d at 329 (Jones, J., concurring and dissenting) (footnote omitted).\n\n      Justice Jones then expressed support for the approach of the Second\n\nRestatement whose purpose, he stated, was to ensure “that the costs of injuries\n\nresulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products\n\non the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect\n\nthemselves.” Id. at 334.\n\n      According to Justice Jones, the judgments that would result from application of\n\nthe Second Restatement were “not a far cry” from the doctrines of res ipsa loquitur and\n\nof exclusive control.   The dissent viewed manufacturers and sellers, proximate or\n\nremote, of products for consumption by the public as subject “to a special responsibility\n\nto any member of the using and consuming public who may be injured by the use and\n\nconsumption of the product.”     The dissent reasoned that the public expects such\n\nmanufacturers and sellers to stand behind their products; therefore, the financial burden\n\nof injuries caused by defective products “should fall upon those who make and market\n\nthe products and the consuming public is entitled to the maximum protection.” Id. at\n\n334-35.\n\n      In his dissent, Justice Roberts, joined by Mr. Justice Musmanno, would also have\n\nreversed the summary judgment entered by the trial court as to all defendants. These\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 47\n\fdissenters reasoned that the majority’s decision elevated form over substance, and they\n\nwould have allowed the cause of action in the matter to proceed either in assumpsit, on\n\nthe basis of a breach of warranty, or in trespass, on the basis of strict liability. In this\n\nregard, the dissent suggested that the same results would obtain whether a plaintiff\n\nchose to pursue his products liability claim on a breach of warranty theory or under the\n\nSecond Restatement.\n\n       The dissenters remarked that the duty of sellers of products for human\n\nconsumption “extended beyond the mere avoidance of negligence,” and had been\n\ncharacterized as a “special responsibility . . . in the nature of an implied warranty that\n\nsuch products would be fit for human consumption. . . .” The duty had been limited to\n\nthe immediate buyer; but, the dissent noted, courts “recognized the injustice inherent in\n\nsuch a limitation” and had developed theories of strict liability in defective food cases.\n\nAt the same time, according to the dissent, the privity requirement was not eliminated as\n\nto non-food products, which presented equal dangers. The dissenters questioned the\n\nmerit of that distinction. From a practical perspective, the dissent also noted that the\n\ndoctrine of privity did not insulate defendants from liability because an action by a\n\nconsumer against a seller simply started a chain reaction of indemnity; “[a]ll that is really\n\naccomplished by the restriction [of privity] is to expose [the] plaintiff to the risk that the\n\nretail seller may not be financially able to make redress and to deprive [the plaintiff] of\n\nthe opportunity of proceeding directly against the more financially able parties in the\n\ndistributive chain.” 221 A.2d at 336-38.\n\n       The dissent then expressed its disapproval of the “conceptual abstractions and\n\nniceties of pleading” that had obscured what it believed was essentially a strict liability\n\ncause of action and the considerations that supported it, and encouraged the Court to\n\nadopt the Second Restatement. In the dissent’s view:\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 48\n\f                      The public interest in affording the maximum\n             protection possible under the law to human life, health and\n             safety; the inability of the consumer to protect himself; the\n             seller’s implied assurance of the safety of a product on the\n             open market; the superior ability of the manufacturer or\n             seller to distribute the risk of loss; the needless circuity of\n             recovery and the expensive, time consuming, wasteful and\n             often unjust process which insistence upon privity frequently\n             occasions -- all support the extension of the protection of\n             strict liability beyond the food cases to those involving other\n             consumer goods as well.\n221 A.2d at 338-39.\n\n      Thus, the 6 to 1 Webb decision itself contained no developed majority\n\nexpression, despite the important transitional point it marked in Pennsylvania law.10\n\n      The commentary to the Second Restatement and the Court’s decisional law over\n\nthe subsequent decade reflect early foundational debates among members of the Court\n\nconcerning the tort.11 In a series of cases, the Court addressed narrow applications of\n\nbroader questions relating to burdens of proof, evidence, and jury instructions in strict\n\n10\n        In Webb, Chief Justice Bell dissented, premised primarily upon the argument that\nthe majority was overruling numerous decisions sub silentio in favor of a “new rule . . .\n[that] so completely changes, not by legislative action but by judicial ukase, the law with\nrespect to trespass actions for injuries resulting from non-inherently dangerous products\nthat are either manufactured or bottled or sold by any vendor . . . that in [the Chief\nJustice’s] opinion it is not only very unfair but absolutely Unjustifiable in Justice or in\nLaw.” 220 A.2d at 855 (Bell, C.J., dissenting).\n\n11\n       In the interim, the Court addressed several corollary matters, without offering any\ninsight into foundational matters of concern here. See, e.g., Ferraro v. Ford Motor Co.,\n223 A.2d 746 (Pa. 1966) (reversing judgment notwithstanding verdict and remanding for\nnew trial; in strict liability case, “if the buyer knows of the defect and Voluntarily and\nUnreasonably proceeds to use the product or encounter a known danger, this should\npreclude recovery and constitute a complete defense to the action”); Burbage v. Boiler\nEng’g & Supply Co., 249 A.2d 563 (Pa. 1969) (affirming judgment in favor of consumer;\nmanufacturer of replacement part is subject in strict liability to consumer).\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 49\n\fliability litigation. To the extent these decisions necessitated explication of conceptual\n\nfoundations, much like the Second Restatement and the commentary, the Court’s\n\nefforts centered on describing in affirmative terms the theoretical basis for strict liability\n\nbut lapsed, generally, into comparisons with the more familiar negligence and warranty\n\ncauses of action in which strict liability was rooted. See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (2D)         OF\n\nTORTS § 402A(2) & cmt. a, c & m.\n\n       For example, in Bialek v. Pittsburgh Brewing Co., 242 A.2d 231 (Pa. 1968), the\n\nCourt noted and rejected a challenge to that part of a jury charge which, the plaintiff\n\nargued, imposed an unwarranted burden upon the plaintiff to prove which particular\n\nseller in the distribution chain had caused the defect in the product.            The Court\n\nreasoned that for liability to attach per Section 402A, “the seller need only sell a\n\ndefective product [and need not] have caused the defect.” The Court added that the\n\ntrial court should instruct the jury that a plaintiff “is not required to prove that the\n\ndefendants were negligent, that the defendants can be held liable even if they exercised\n\nall possible care and that no consideration should be given to negligence.” But, the\n\nCourt explained, sellers in a distributive chain who precede a seller that caused the\n\ndefect do not sell a defective product and are not liable. In this sense, according to the\n\nCourt, the plaintiff’s theory of the case is relevant and the trial court has discretion to\n\ntailor the charge to reflect the evidence and theories of the parties. Id. at 235-36.\n\n       In Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., 319 A.2d 914 (Pa. 1974) (Opinion and\n\nOpinion Announcing Judgment of Court), the expression authored by Mr. Justice\n\nPomeroy, in which Mr. Justice O’Brien joined, did not summon a majority of the\n\nmembers of the Court for disposition of the strict liability-related claims, which several\n\nJustices would not have reached on appeal. The OAJC offered an explication of the\n\nburden of proof in a strict liability case premised upon circumstantial rather than direct\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 50\n\fevidence of a defect, i.e., the so-called malfunction theory; the theory is of major\n\nimportance as it was later adopted by a majority of the Court in Rogers v. Johnson &\n\nJohnson Products, Inc., 565 A.2d 751 (Pa. 1989). See also Barnish v. KWI Building\n\nCo., 980 A.2d 535 (Pa. 2009).\n\n       In Kuisis, the plaintiff alleged that he was injured when a crane’s brake locking\n\nmechanism became disengaged, causing a load of steel pipe suspended on the crane\n\nto fall on him. The plaintiff proceeded on theories of negligence and strict liability in the\n\ndesign and manufacture of the brake locking mechanism. At the close of evidence, the\n\ntrial court granted summary relief to the manufacturer on the negligence claim and\n\nsubmitted the strict liability claims to the jury; the jury was dismissed when it could not\n\nagree on a verdict. Subsequently, the trial court granted the manufacturer’s motion for\n\njudgment on the record.     On appeal, this Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and\n\nawarded the plaintiff a new trial.     Justice Pomeroy’s OAJC reasoned that evidence\n\nrelating to the accident, in addition to the occurrence of five similar malfunctions of the\n\nlocking mechanism, was sufficient to show that the product was defective, even absent\n\ndirect evidence of a specific defect. According to the OAJC, in the absence of other\n\nidentifiable causes, the malfunction itself was evidence of a defective condition; “[t]his\n\nrule reflects the fact that liability under [Section] 402A turns on a lack of fitness in the\n\ndefendant’s product, as in the case of an action for breach of warranty, rather than on\n\nthe breach of a particular duty of care by the defendant, as in the case of an action for\n\nnegligence.” The OAJC continued: “[w]hile a plaintiff’s hand in a strict liability case will\n\nobviously be strengthened by evidence of a specific defect in the defendant’s product\n\nsuch evidence is not necessary to take . . . the plaintiff’s case to a jury.” Id. at 920.\n\n       Finally, the OAJC commented upon the relevance of proof that the crane\n\noperator had left the controls while the pipe was suspended. According to the OAJC,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 51\n\fthe operator’s alleged negligence was legally significant as a potential superseding\n\ncause of the plaintiff’s injuries. Kuisis, 319 A.2d at 920; see also Rogers, 565 A.2d at\n\n755. But, the opinion continued, operator negligence was not a superseding cause of\n\nthe plaintiff’s injuries unless the negligent conduct was outside the manufacturer’s\n\n“reasonable range of foreseeability.”       Justice Pomeroy opined that the principle of\n\nforeseeability “carries over from traditional negligence law to strict liability cases. . . . It\n\nmakes no difference in this regard whether the operator’s conduct is characterized as\n\nan intervening act of negligence or as an ‘abnormal use’ of the crane; where under\n\n[Section] 402A a particular use of a product is abnormal depends on whether the use\n\nwas reasonably foreseeable by the seller.” Kuisis, 319 A.2d at 920-21 & n.13. Other\n\nproof relevant to the question of foreseeability, the OAJC added, was the passage of\n\ntwenty years since the crane had been manufactured and any interim alterations. Id. at\n\n922 & n.15.12\n\n       Following the decision in Kuisis, the Court revisited questions relating both to a\n\nplaintiff’s burden of proving a strict liability claim, and relevant jury instructions, in\n\n12\n       In parallel developments, the Court dispensed with privity prerequisites for stating\na breach of an implied warranty claim, by reference to the Second Restatement. The\nKassab Court reasoned that clarity in the law and consistency of results, whether one\nlabeled a complaint in assumpsit / warranty or trespass / strict liability, counseled\nabandoning vertical privity requirements. See Kassab, 246 A.2d at 853-56 overruled in\npart on other grounds by AM/PM Franchise Ass’n v. Atl. Richfield Co., 584 A.2d 915\n(Pa. 1990) (remote supplier of defective product may be sued for breach of warranty).\nIn Salvador, the Court discarded horizontal privity stating that: “Today . . . a\nmanufacturer by virtue of [S]ection 402A is effectively the guarantor of his products’\nsafety. . . . [A manufacturer] may not preclude an injured plaintiff’s recovery by forcing\nhim to prove negligence in the manufacturing process. Neither may the manufacturer\ndefeat the claim by arguing that the purchaser has no contractual relation to him.”\nSalvador, 319 A.2d at 907 (injured user may sue for breach of warranty, even if user is\nnot purchaser, member of purchaser’s family or household, or guest in purchaser’s\nhouse).\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 52\n\fBerkebile v. Brantly Helicopter Corp., 337 A.2d 893 (Pa. 1975) (Opinion Announcing\n\nJudgment of Court). The Court affirmed by unanimous mandate the decision of the\n\nSuperior Court to reverse the judgment on the verdict granted to the defendant and to\n\naward the plaintiff a new (third) trial. The decision generated several opinions, among\n\nthem the OAJC of Chief Justice Jones, joined by Justice Nix, parts of which later\n\nbecame law in Azzarello. See 391 A.2d at 1027 and discussion infra. Justices Roberts\n\nand Pomeroy filed separate concurring opinions, while Justices Eagen, O’Brien, and\n\nManderino concurred in the result without opinion.\n\n       The Berkebile OAJC commenced its analysis by noting the necessity “to clarify\n\nthe concepts of strict liability in Pennsylvania,” so as to avoid further confusion in the\n\ncase upon remand for a third trial. In concurring, Justices Roberts and Pomeroy would\n\nhave decided the matter on the separate issue of strict liability for a failure to warn. 337\n\nA.2d at 903-04.\n\n       In Berkebile, following the death of her husband in a helicopter crash, the\n\nadministratrix of the estate sued the manufacturer, premised upon theories of strict\n\nliability for defective design of the helicopter’s rotor system, for defective manufacturing\n\nand design of the rotor blade, for inadequate warnings regarding the inherent risks and\n\nlimitations of the rotor system, and for misrepresentation of the helicopter’s safety in the\n\nmanufacturer’s advertising brochures. The defendant denied the existence of a defect\n\nand argued that the decedent’s abnormal use had caused the crash.\n\n       The Berkebile OAJC reiterated that strict liability, as a cause of action,\n\nimplemented a policy of consumer protection. According to the OAJC, “[t]he increasing\n\ncomplexity of the manufacturing and distributional process placed upon the injured\n\nplaintiff a nearly impossible burden of proving negligence where, for policy reasons, it\n\nwas felt that a seller should be responsible for injuries caused by defects in his\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 53\n\fproducts.” Id. at 898 (citing RESTATEMENT (2D)      OF     TORTS § 402A cmt. c). The OAJC\n\nexplained that, in a strict liability matter, proof of a seller’s due care and breach of due\n\ncare are unnecessary because liability attaches “without fault.” Id. (citing Salvador, 319\n\nA.2d at 907). Instead, to recover, a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective,\n\nand that the defect was a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.          In addition,\n\naccording to the OAJC, the plaintiff has the burden to prove that the defect causing the\n\ninjury existed at the time that the product left the seller’s hands. The OAJC then warned\n\nof attempts by a defendant-seller at “indirectly . . . injecting negligence concepts into\n\nstrict liability theory.” Id. at 899.\n\n       The Berkebile OAJC also parsed the language of the Second Restatement,\n\nopining that the Restatement imposes a seemingly contradictory burden of proving that\n\na “defect” is “unreasonably dangerous.” According to the OAJC, the standards are\n\nreconcilable if the purpose of the “unreasonably dangerous” qualification is “to\n\ndifferentiate those products which are by their very nature unsafe but not defective from\n\nthose which can truly be called defective.” The OAJC rejected the notion that defect\n\nshould be defined based upon the negligence-oriented reasonable man concept, which\n\ntended to dilute the strict liability concept, and offered that the “unreasonably dangerous\n\nclause” should be included in articulating the issue of proximate cause to the jury. Chief\n\nJustice Jones explained that the result of limiting the liability of a seller premised upon a\n\n“reasonable man” standard, which the clause “unreasonably dangerous” could suggest,\n\nprotects the seller from becoming “an insurer of his products with respect to all harm\n\ngenerated by their use.” But, such standard would also require an injured consumer-\n\nplaintiff to prove an element of negligence, which means in practice that, regardless of\n\nthe injured consumer’s expectations regarding the product, the injured consumer would\n\nbe unable to recover if an “ordinary consumer” would have expected the product’s\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 54\n\fdefective condition. Chief Justice Jones opined that it is unnecessary to place the\n\nadditional burden upon the injured consumer to limit a seller’s liability because the seller\n\nis adequately protected “by the necessity of proving that there was a defect in the\n\nmanufacture or design of the product, and that such defect was a proximate cause of\n\nthe injuries.” Id. at 899-900 (quoting Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp., 501 P.2d 1153, 1161\n\n(Cal. 1972), whose holding we address infra). As a result, the OAJC concluded that the\n\njury should not be instructed as to the reasonable man standard or reasonableness “in\n\nany form.” Id. at 900.\n\n       Chief Justice Jones added that proof of strict liability is not premised upon\n\nwhether the seller could have foreseen a particular injury, for to articulate the burden of\n\nproof in terms of foreseeability is to require the plaintiff to prove that the seller exercised\n\ndue care. But, because the seller is liable in strict liability regardless of any negligence,\n\nwhether the seller could have foreseen a particular injury is irrelevant. Once a product\n\nis proved defective, the seller is responsible for all the unforeseen harm it caused, no\n\nmatter how remote. Moreover, Chief Justice Jones reasoned, a plaintiff’s negligence\n\ndoes not bar recovery in strict liability, although evidence that would tend to prove such\n\nnegligence may be relevant for the purpose of rebutting the plaintiff’s contentions of\n\ndefect and proximate cause. Id. at 901.\n\n       Finally, the Berkebile OAJC addressed the viability of the plaintiff’s failure to warn\n\nclaims, reasoning that the trial court had erred in failing to charge the jury on the point.\n\nChief Justice Jones stated: “A ‘defective condition’ is not limited to defects in design or\n\nmanufacture. The seller must provide with the product every element necessary\n\nto make it safe for use.       One such element may be warnings and/or instructions\n\nconcerning use of the product. A seller must give such warning and instructions as are\n\nrequired to inform the user or consumer of the possible risks and inherent limitations of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 55\n\fhis product.” Id. at 902 (emphasis added) (citing RESTATEMENT (2D)      OF   TORTS § 402A\n\ncmt. c).    The portion of the Berkebile lead opinion emphasized above was quoted\n\nsubsequently out of context by the majority in Azzarello as the standard of proof in a\n\nstrict liability action.\n\n        Looking back, it is now apparent that the first decade of applying the doctrine of\n\nstrict liability in Pennsylvania offered a series of missed opportunities to develop a\n\nvibrant and coherent body of common law on the issue. The difficulties arose from the\n\nhappenstance of the idiosyncratic procedural postures of cases in which the Court\n\nnevertheless apparently sought to make conceptual advances in the arena. To start,\n\nthe Webb Court “adopted” the Second Restatement and remanded the case to the trial\n\ncourt for application, without offering much explanation of either how Section 402A\n\nderived from or complemented existing common law, or direction concerning its\n\napplication by the lower courts, including the realm of jury charges. The procedural\n\nposture of Webb -- an appeal from a trial court decision sustaining preliminary\n\nobjections -- and some consensus regarding the direction of the law, perhaps explain\n\nthe approach. The concurring and dissenting expressions in Miller, upon which the\n\nWebb Court relied, offered a more reasoned explanation for the availability of strict\n\nliability in tort as a separate cause of action and attenuated, to a degree, the stark\n\napproach of the summary Webb majority decision. But, the responsive expressions --\n\noffered in the context of a breach of warranty case no less -- suggested little in terms of\n\nan explication of essential foundational concepts or practical application, which are\n\ngenerally the sine qua non of common law decisions.\n\n        And so, much like the Second Restatement articulation of strict liability,\n\nPennsylvania decisional law did not speak affirmatively to the plaintiff’s burden of proof\n\nin strict liability cases but addressed it by negation, i.e., as compared to then-more\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 56\n\ffamiliar theories of breach of warranty initially and, later, negligence. In the subsequent\n\ndecade, foundational issues regarding the strict liability in tort cause of action did not\n\nreach the Supreme Court or, when questions were presented, expressions failed to\n\ncommand clear majority support.        To the extent that the Court spoke to broader\n\nconsiderations, several trends became evident: the original prominence of warranty-\n\nrelated attempts to limit application of strict liability theory decreased, and the relevance\n\nof negligence-related encroachments commenced its ascent; rhetoric emerged not only\n\nto distinguish strict liability from its negligence roots, but also to excise negligence\n\nprinciples and terms (such as foreseeability) from strict liability theory; the reliance upon\n\nformulaic reiteration of consumer protection-related policies, offered as a bulwark\n\nagainst attempts to dilute the application of strict liability theory in individual cases; and\n\nthen a focus in strict liability theory that ultimately turned upon a statutory construction-\n\ntype of analysis of the Second Restatement. Experience suggests that these trends,\n\nand fits and starts, have proven antithetical to the orderly evolution of our decisional\n\nlaw, one that must be responsive to new problems, perspectives, and consequences.\n\n\n\n                                      2.     Azzarello\n\n       In 1978, the Court was confronted with the question of whether the trial court had\n\nadequately charged a jury on the law of products liability in Pennsylvania.              The\n\nAzzarello plaintiff had been injured when he pinched his hand between two hard rubber\n\nrolls in a coating machine manufactured by Black Brothers Company.               The plaintiff\n\nproceeded on a theory of strict liability against the manufacturer, but the manufacturer\n\nalso joined the plaintiff’s employer as a co-defendant, asserting that the employer’s\n\nnegligence was the sole or contributing cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. See Azzarello,\n\n391 A.2d at 1022. In a unanimous opinion, the Court held that the jury charge issued by\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 57\n\fthe trial court was misleading and affirmed the decision of the Superior Court, which had\n\ngranted the plaintiff a new trial. The Azzarello Court approved an alternative charge.\n\nId. at 1027 n.12.\n\n       The Court addressed two related and important questions: whether a\n\ndetermination as to the risk of loss in a strict liability case is a decision for the judge or\n\nthe jury, and whether the words “unreasonably dangerous” have any place in the strict\n\nliability jury instruction. The Court concluded that the words “unreasonably dangerous”\n\nexplain the term “defective” but have “no independent significance and merely represent\n\na label to be used where it is determined that the risk of loss should be placed upon the\n\nsupplier.” The words “unreasonably dangerous” limit liability and signal that a seller is\n\nnot an insurer but a guarantor of the product. However, the difficulty with the use of the\n\nterm in jury instructions, the Court reasoned, was that it signaled to the jury that the\n\nconsumer has the burden to prove an element of negligence. According to the Court, in\n\nstrict liability cases, burdening a plaintiff with proof of negligence is unwarranted; the\n\nseller’s liability is limited “by the necessity of proving that there was a defect in the\n\nmanufacture or design of the product, and that such defect was a (legal) cause of the\n\ninjuries.” Id. at 1025 (quoting Cronin, 501 P.2d at 1161-62); see also Berkebile, 337\n\nA.2d at 899-900.\n\n       The Azzarello Court further reasoned that a change in terminology to avoid\n\nreferences to negligence principles would be insufficient to articulate instructions\n\nappropriate for a lay jury. Indeed, according to the Court, the formulation of the Second\n\nRestatement was not intended to articulate jury instructions but employed principles\n\ndesigned instead to predict responsibility and to guide the professional bench and bar.\n\nThe Court then concluded that the best means to implement the principles of the\n\nSecond Restatement was to direct: (1) that the phrases “defective condition” and\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 58\n\f“unreasonably dangerous,” which predict whether recovery would be justified, are\n\nissues of law and policy entrusted solely for decision to the trial court; and (2) that the\n\ninquiry into whether a plaintiff has proven the factual allegations in the complaint is a\n\nquestion for the jury. According to the Court, in cases of an alleged defective design,\n\nthe dispositive question is whether the product is safe for its intended use. The Court\n\nemphasized that the seller is the “guarantor” of the product, and a jury could find a\n\ndefect “where the product left the supplier’s control lacking any element necessary to\n\nmake it safe for its intended use or possessing any feature that renders it unsafe for the\n\nintended use.” Id. at 1027 (citing Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 902). Having concluded that\n\nthe jury should not be instructed on the “unreasonably dangerous” standard, the Court\n\nthen affirmed the Superior Court’s decision to remand the case to the trial court for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n\n\n                  3.      Post-Azzarello Design Defect Jurisprudence\n\n       Following Azzarello, decisional focus in strict liability cases shifted to reflect an\n\nincreasing concern with segregating strict liability and negligence concepts. The Court\n\naddressed several evidentiary questions, in the process touching upon foundational\n\nnotions of strict liability relevant to a design defect claim.13\n\n\n13\n        The jurisprudence of strict liability for failure to warn also developed in parallel.\nSee, e.g., Sherk v. Daisy-Heddon, 450 A.2d 615 (Pa. 1982) (where lethal propensity of\ntoy gun was known or should have been known to user, manufacturer not strictly liable\nfor failure to warn); Mackowick v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 575 A.2d 100 (Pa. 1990)\n(capacitor not defective for failure to warn electrician/intended user of obvious danger of\nlive, exposed electrical wires); Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1383 (strict liability for failure to warn\nof prescription drug’s dangerous propensities is not recognized as cause of action\nagainst pharmacist); Hahn v. Richter, 673 A.2d 888 (Pa. 1996) (where adequacy of\nwarnings associated with prescription drugs is at issue, strict liability is not recognized\nas basis for liability); Davis v. Berwind Corp., 690 A.2d 186 (Pa. 1997) (notwithstanding\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 59\n\f       In Lewis v. Coffing Hoist Division, Duff-Norton Co., 528 A.2d 590 (Pa. 1987), the\n\nCourt affirmed the Superior Court’s decision to uphold a jury verdict in favor of a plaintiff\n\nwho alleged that the design of a control box for an overhead electric hoist was defective\n\nbecause it lacked a safety mechanism to prevent accidental depression of the control\n\nbuttons. The plaintiff had injured his legs when he accidentally depressed the control\n\nbuttons, which caused the hoist to swing its load into his body. The Court rejected the\n\ndefendant’s claim that the trial court erred in excluding expert testimony relating to\n\nindustry standards and practices, e.g., that ninety percent of similar hoists lacked a\n\nguard around the control panel and that a nationwide trade group had certified the\n\nproduct design as safe.\n\n       Before addressing whether particular expert testimony was relevant to a strict\n\nliability cause of action, the Lewis Court set out its view of the applicable substantive\n\nlaw. The Court noted that strict liability in tort was a cause of action available when an\n\ninjury is caused by a defect in design. The Second Restatement, according to the\n\nCourt, does not provide a definition of the term “defect,” and jurisdictions have\n\narticulated diverse formulas on the subject of design defect.          The Court noted a\n\n“consumer expectations” approach, which is an inquiry into whether the product “failed\n\nto perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended\n\nor reasonably foreseeable manner.” Id. at 593 (citing Barker v. Lull Engineering Co.,\n\n573 P.2d 443 (Cal. 1978)).      A second accepted approach, according to the Court,\n\ninvolves “risk-utility” balancing.   Id. (citing Barker, supra, and A. Weinstein et al,\n\nPRODUCTS LIABILITY AND THE REASONABLY SAFE PRODUCT, at 43-59 (1978)). However, in\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\nease of removing safety device, warning on blender sufficient to caution operator\nagainst conduct that caused injury).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 60\n\fPennsylvania, the Court explained, Azzarello articulated a distinct approach: “the jury\n\nmay find a defect where the product left the supplier’s control lacking any element\n\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use or possessing any feature that renders it\n\nunsafe for the intended use.” Id. (citing Azzarello, 391 A.2d 1027).\n\n       The Lewis Court observed that jurisdictions with various approaches agreed that\n\nrelevant at trial is the condition of the product rather than the reasonableness of the\n\nmanufacturer’s conduct. As a result, the Court concluded, a strict liability claim does not\n\nsound in negligence -- a proposition in harmony with the Azzarello decision. The Court\n\nheld that, because “due care” has no bearing upon liability in a strict liability case, proof\n\nof industry standards -- which go to a negligence concept of reasonable care -- are\n\nirrelevant and “created a strong likelihood of diverting the jury’s attention from [the\n\nproduct] to the reasonableness of the [manufacturer-defendant’s] conduct in choosing\n\nits design.” Id. at 593-94.\n\n       Mr. Justice Larsen concurred, adding that because of their “inherently self-\n\nserving nature,” admission of industry standards evidence would be highly prejudicial to\n\nthe consumer. In a dissent, Mr. Justice Flaherty criticized the majority’s approach to\n\nstrict liability claims, noting that evidence of injury alone is insufficient to prove a strict\n\nliability claim; rather, industry standards are relevant to the question of defect. This is\n\nso, the dissent said, because suppliers are liable only if an unsafe product is placed on\n\nthe market: strict liability “does not impose liability for failing to make an already safe\n\nproduct somewhat safer, or for failing to utilize the safest of all possible designs. We\n\nare simply not dealing with conceptual Platonic ideals of perfection when a jury\n\nconsiders whether any given product is safe.” Id. at 595. In a separate dissent, Mr.\n\nJustice Hutchinson, also joined by Justice Flaherty, opined that industry standards are\n\nwritten by specialized individuals with knowledge of product design superior to that of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 61\n\fcourts and, as a result, evidence of such standards is relevant to the question of defect.\n\nJustices Flaherty and Hutchinson concluded that evidence of industry standards was\n\nadmissible although not necessarily highly probative.\n\n       Later, in Kimco Development Corporation v. Michael D’s Carpet Outlets, 637\n\nA.2d 603 (Pa. 1993), the Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court, and held\n\nthat the comparative negligence of a co-defendant is not a basis upon which to\n\ndecrease the amount of damages available premised upon a strict liability claim. In\n\nKimco, a shopping center owner and several tenants sued the manufacturer of\n\npolyurethane foam carpet padding, which caught fire and damaged the shopping center,\n\nas well as the tenant in whose store the fire broke out; the tenant-defendant\n\ncountersued the manufacturer and shopping center owner. The parties asserted claims\n\nof negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability in tort. The jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of the plaintiffs on theories of strict liability and negligence, apportioning\n\nnegligence responsibility 80/20 to the tenant-defendant and manufacturer, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the jury found in favor of the tenant-defendant and against the manufacturer\n\non a strict liability theory.   The trial court denied a motion to reduce the tenant-\n\ndefendant’s strict liability verdict against the manufacturer premised upon the\n\napportionment of responsibility in negligence. The Superior Court affirmed.\n\n       On appeal, this Court rejected the manufacturer’s argument that comparative\n\nnegligence is a defense to a claim in strict liability. Initially, the Court noted that “[t]he\n\nlaw amongst the various states is in considerable disarray on the point in question.”\n\nThe Court then reasoned that applying contributory negligence principles to strict liability\n\nclaims would cause “conceptual confusion” and would undermine the purpose of strict\n\nliability: “[t]hroughout the development of [Section] 402A liability, we have been\n\nadamant that negligence concepts have no place in a strict liability action.” Id. at 605-\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 62\n\f06 (citing Azzarello, McCown, and Berkebile). According to the Court, in strict liability,\n\n“the focus is on the nature of the product and the consumer’s reasonable expectations\n\nwith regard to the product, rather than upon the conduct of either the manufacturer or\n\nthe person injured.” The Court concluded that permitting recoveries to be reduced\n\npremised on negligence concepts would weaken the deterrent effect of the policy to\n\nprotect the consumer and to shift the risk of loss to the supplier of the defective product\n\n“without regard to fault or privity of contract.”       Id. at 605-07.14   Justice Flaherty\n\ndissented, premised upon the argument that strict liability without regard to\n\nproportionate faults burdened business enterprises with liabilities that worked serious\n\ndetriment to the economy.\n\n\n\n                   4.     Recent Cases and the Third Restatement\n\n      In 1998, the ALI proposed a new restatement of the law relating specifically to\n\nproducts liability. See RESTATEMENT (3D)   OF   TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY §§ 1-8 (1998)\n\n(Liability Rules Applicable to Products Generally). As is evident from the premise of this\n\nlitigation, this Court has not yet determined whether to adopt the formulation of the Third\n\nRestatement as the law of Pennsylvania. However, the suggestion for a “move” to the\n\nThird Restatement, or adoption of certain of its principles, has been made in several\n\nnon-precedential opinions.\n\n14\n         By comparison, doctrinal separation played a noticeably less prominent role in an\nearlier decision relating to whether contributory negligence was an available defense to\na strict liability claim. In McCown v. International Harvester Co., 342 A.2d 381 (Pa.\n1975), the Court held that contributory negligence was not an available defense in a\nstrict liability case because such recognition would contradict the normal expectation of\nproduct safety upon which the strict liability cause of action is premised. “One does not\ninspect a product for defects or guard against the possibility of product defects when\none assumes the item to be safe.” Id. at 382.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 63\n\f       In 2003, the question before a six-Justice Court was whether a supplier was\n\nresponsible in strict liability to a consumer-plaintiff other than the intended user of the\n\nproduct.   See Phillips v. Cricket Lighters, 841 A.2d 1000 (Pa. 2003) (OAJC).             The\n\nplaintiff had alleged that the butane lighter designed and manufactured by the defendant\n\nwas defective because it lacked a safety device that would have prevented a two year-\n\nold from setting the tragic fire that killed the child, his sibling and his mother. In relevant\n\npart, the Court reversed the decision of the Superior Court and reinstated the trial\n\ncourt’s summary judgment order. The Court was deeply divided in its reasoning.\n\n       The single Justice OAJC authored by Mr. Chief Justice Cappy concluded that a\n\nproduct is not defective if it is safe for its intended user. Id. at 1005. The OAJC rejected\n\nthe plaintiff’s argument that a manufacturer should be responsible for harm to a\n\nforeseeable albeit unintended user, opining that foreseeability concepts have no\n\napplication in strict liability theory and foreseeable users may recover by proving\n\nnegligence.    Among other things, the OAJC recognized that some strict liability\n\ndecisions had relied upon foreseeability principles but the opinion denounced the\n\npractice and would have reaffirmed the firm conceptual distinction between strict liability\n\nand negligence causes of action. Id. at 1007 (citing Davis v. Berwind Corp., 690 A.2d\n\n186 (Pa. 1997)). “Recognition that strict liability is not a type of mongrel derivative of\n\nnegligence is also consistent with the historical development of this cause of action.\n\nStrict liability was intended to be a cause of action separate and distinct from\n\nnegligence, designed to fill a perceived gap in our tort law.” Id. (citing Azzarello, 391\n\nA.2d at 1023-24). In a footnote, the OAJC noted the supplier’s alternative argument\n\nrelating to the Third Restatement, but deemed it waived. Mr. Justice Nigro concurred in\n\nthe result, without an opinion.       Madame Justice Newman filed a concurring and\n\ndissenting opinion, in which she agreed with the OAJC that the strict liability claims\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 64\n\ffailed because the lighter was safe for its intended use by adults; Justice Newman\n\ndissented from that part of the opinion addressing the disposition of the plaintiff’s\n\nnegligence claim. Id. at 1024 (Newman, J., concurring and dissenting).\n\n       Mr. Justice Saylor authored a concurring opinion, which this author and Mr.\n\nJustice Eakin joined.    Justice Saylor advocated taking the opportunity to address\n\nfoundational matters, to reassess Pennsylvania’s Second Restatement approach, and\n\nto examine the range of readily accessible, corrective measures, including adoption of\n\nthe Third Restatement. In relevant part, the concurrence addressed three points: first,\n\nthat strict liability doctrine is embedded with concepts central to negligence theory;\n\nsecond, that ambiguities and inconsistencies in prevailing strict liability jurisprudence\n\naffected the proper disposition of the appeal; and third, that the Third Restatement’s\n\napproach would provide the most viable route to clarification and remediation of strict\n\nliability jurisprudence in Pennsylvania.\n\n       On the first point, Justice Saylor noted that the Second Restatement articulation\n\nfor the strict liability cause of action posed difficulties in application to design defect\n\nclaims. At origin, Justice Saylor explained, the standard derived from manufacturing\n\ndefect cases, in which “something went wrong in the manufacturing process” and the\n\nresulting product was not as safe as intended. The core objectives of the Second\n\nRestatement had been to relieve consumer-plaintiffs of the burden of proving that the\n\nsupplier had exercised due care in the manufacturing process (necessary to prove\n\nnegligence), and to spread the risk of loss among consumers. But, Justice Saylor\n\nobserved, courts had since recognized the “limitations of the just implementation of loss\n\nspreading via judicially crafted doctrine.” Id. at 1013 n.3 (citing Duchess v. Langston\n\nCorp., 769 A.2d 1131, 1145 (Pa. 2001)). Consistent with its purposes, the Second\n\nRestatement declared a supplier liable even if it exercised all possible care in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 65\n\fpreparation and sale of the product. But, application of the doctrine was limited to\n\ndefective products unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or his property.                  The\n\nconcurrence noted that the Second Restatement formulation, as a result, contained an\n\ninternal tension: the strict liability rule “was tempered by a negligence-based concept of\n\ndefect.” In application to design defect claims, the concurrence further observed, courts\n\nin Pennsylvania recognized “an integral role for risk-utility (or cost-benefit) balancing,\n\nderived from negligence theory.” Id. at 1013-14 (citing Azzarello, 391 A.2d at 1026;\n\nBurch v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 467 A.2d 615, 618 (Pa. Super. 1983); Dambacher v.\n\nMallis, 485 A.2d 408, 422 (Pa. Super. 1984)). As a result, while the rhetoric of retaining\n\na firm separation between strict liability and negligence remained pervasive in\n\ndecisional law, in application, the distinction was unnecessary: “[i]n design cases the\n\ncharacter of the product and the conduct of the manufacturer are largely inseparable.”\n\nThe concurrence advocated recognition of the essential role played by negligence-\n\nderived risk-utility balancing in design defect litigation. Id. at 1015-16.\n\n       Relating to the second point, the concurrence offered a critique of Azzarello,\n\nwhich is particularly relevant since Omega Flex echoes the analysis in this appeal.\n\nAccording to the concurrence, courts have implemented the Azzarello decision by: (1)\n\nassigning the risk-utility balancing to trial courts on the facts most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff; and (2) providing juries with minimalistic instructions that, in an effort to insulate\n\nthe jury from negligence terminology, “lack essential guidance concerning the nature of\n\nthe central conception of product defect.” Because the jury is not permitted to consider\n\nthe cost-benefit factors, neither judge nor jury “actually decide whether the true benefits\n\nof the proposed alternative design outweigh the true cost” and whether the product is in\n\nfact unreasonably dangerous or defective. Furthermore, the concurrence added that,\n\nby omitting the critical “unreasonably dangerous” limitation on liability or cost-benefit\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 66\n\finstructions, the Azzarello-approved charge fails to define the term “defect” clearly, and\n\nconsequently fails to guide the jury in distinguishing products safe and unsafe for their\n\nintended use.    The concurrence also noted that the use of the term “guarantor” in\n\nrelation to the manufacturer is not a sufficient limitation on liability, especially because\n\nthe term “to a lay jury will surely seem indistinguishable from ‘insurer.’” 841 A.2d at\n\n1016-18 (citing Thomas, 71 Temp. L. Rev. at 225 & 232). The concurrence advocated\n\ncorrection of this jurisprudence in the interest of justice.\n\n        On the final point, the concurrence suggested the Third Restatement as a viable\n\nalternative articulation of the standard of proof, with the potential to resolve the\n\npersisting difficulties and to enhance fairness and efficacy in the liability schema. Id. at\n\n1021.    According to the concurrence, the Third Restatement’s negligence-derived\n\nstandard represents “the distilled expression of thirty years of design-defect litigation.”\n\nThe concurrence summarized the general rule of the Third Restatement as follows: “a\n\nproduct is deemed defective in design when the foreseeable risks could have been\n\nreduced or avoided by the use of a reasonable alternative design, and when the failure\n\nto utilize such a design has caused the product to be ‘not reasonably safe.’” The\n\nconcurrence explained that design defect liability under the Third Restatement is\n\npredicated upon a concept of responsibility in which the determination is made by\n\nreference to an independent assessment of advantages and disadvantages, rather than\n\nby reference to the manufacturer’s own design or marketing standards, which are in fact\n\nalleged to be unreasonable by the plaintiff.         Moreover, the concurrence stressed,\n\nproducts are not defective simply because they are dangerous. Relevant to the issue in\n\nPhillips, the concurrence added that the Third Restatement expressly incorporates\n\nnotions of reasonable foreseeability that would temper the exclusive reliance on the\n\nrisk-utility test. In the view of the concurrence, the Third Restatement provided the best-\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 67\n\fbalanced and reasoned approach to strict liability in Pennsylvania. On a final note, the\n\nconcurrence opined that application of the strict liability doctrine should be closely\n\nlimited until the existing substantial deficiencies in the strict liability schema are\n\naddressed and remedied by the Court.\n\n       In 2006, the Court decided General Services, the case upon which Omega Flex\n\nrelies extensively. The Court there awarded the supplier a new trial, holding that the\n\ntrial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that a supplier is liable only for harm that\n\noccurs in connection with the intended use of a product by an intended user. 898 A.2d\n\nat 600 (citing Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1007 (OAJC); id. at 1018 (Saylor, J., concurring,\n\njoined by Castille & Eakin, JJ.); id. at 1023 (Newman, J., concurring and dissenting). In\n\nGeneral Services, a Commonwealth agency asserted claims in strict liability against,\n\ninter alia, the manufacturer of a synthetic chemical detected on surfaces and in the\n\nambient air of the Transportation and Safety Building, an office tower in Harrisburg,\n\nfollowing a fire that consumed building materials containing the chemical. The supplier\n\noffered proposed jury instructions, which the trial court rejected, that would have\n\ndistinguished between the supplier’s liability exposure for fire-related and other\n\ncontamination with the synthetic chemical.\n\n       In an opinion by Justice Saylor, the General Services Court noted the consensus\n\nin Phillips, supra, against “expanding the scope of manufacturer liability without fault in a\n\ngeneralized fashion” pending an overhaul of strict liability doctrine by the Court. In this\n\nrespect, the Court acknowledged that accidental combustion of the building materials\n\nwas foreseeable and that an argument could be made for the notion that safety for an\n\nintended use of the materials should be deemed to encompass safety under such\n\ncircumstances. The Court nevertheless rejected the argument that expansion of liability\n\npremised upon negligence-based foreseeability considerations was warranted,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 68\n\femphasizing an incongruity with simultaneously constraining a supplier’s resort to\n\nnegligence-based use-related defenses. See 898 A.2d at 600-04. Absent expansion of\n\nliability, the Court explained, the Commonwealth agency could not recover damages\n\ncaused by the incineration of building materials, which was not a use intended by the\n\nmanufacturer. A cause of action in strict liability remained viable for harm caused by\n\ncontamination of the Commonwealth agency’s office building through off-gassing of the\n\nchemical. Id. at 604.15\n\n       Poised to address foundational questions relating to the application of the strict\n\nliability doctrine in Pennsylvania, in 2008, the Court granted allowance of appeal in\n\nBugosh v. I.U. North Am., Inc., 942 A.2d 897 (Pa. 2008) (per curiam).                 In 2009,\n\nhowever, the Court dismissed the ensuing appeal as improvidently granted; Justice\n\nSaylor, joined by this author, dissented from the summary disposition. See Bugosh,\n\n971 A.2d at 1228; id. at 1229-44 (Saylor J., dissenting, joined by Castille, C.J.).\n\n       In a dissenting statement, Justice Saylor reiterated that foundational concerns\n\npersisted in the area of strict liability and, by way of background, recapitulated the main\n\n\n15\n       Also of note, in General Services, Justice Newman dissented in part, and Mr.\nJustice Baer joined Justice Newman’s expression. The dissent argued that the matter\nimplicated not a misuse of the product by a user, as Phillips had, but a situation in which\nduring an intended use by an intended user, the product was exposed to easily\nanticipated conditions. Justice Newman would have found the doctrine of strict liability\napplicable, on a theory akin to the “crashworthiness exception,” and would have denied\nthe manufacturer’s request for a new trial. Id. at 619. Omega Flex argues that the\nTinchers relied upon the theory described by the dissent and rejected by the General\nServices majority. But, the General Services majority noted that its “discussion [did] not\naddress a situation in which a defect in the building materials is the cause of\ncombustion occurring during their ordinary use.” 898 A.2d at 601 n.11. The Tinchers’\nallegations are precisely that a defect in the CSST was a cause of the fire occurring\nduring the CSST’s ordinary use. The decision in General Services is, as a result,\ndistinguishable on its face, notwithstanding Omega Flex’s arguments to the contrary.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 69\n\fpoints of the Phillips concurrence. The dissent also noted that the categorical divide\n\nbetween strict liability and negligence principles, articulated in the cases, is most readily\n\njustified in manufacturing defect cases; claims implicating design or warning defect,\n\nhowever, are far more problematic.        Relevant to design defect claims, the dissent\n\nexplained that doctrinal limiting principles evolved to contain the liability of product\n\nsuppliers because traditional notions of strict liability were ill-suited to a tort regime with\n\na largely open-ended damages scheme and the reality that all product designs are\n\ncapable of contributing to human injury. According to the dissent, the alternative of a\n\njudicially imposed mandatory insurance scheme upon the business community is\n\nunpalatable and incongruent with the general rejection of a pure loss-spreading tort\n\nsystem. Id. at 1234-35 & n.10 (citing Cafazzo v. Central Med. Health Servs., Inc., 668\n\nA.2d 521, 526 (Pa. 1995); Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1387).               The dissent suggested a\n\nnegligence-derived risk-utility approach to limiting supplier liability, aimed at establishing\n\nliability boundaries and reconciling strict liability doctrine with the historical grounding of\n\ntort law in notions of corrective justice. In this regard, the dissent noted with approval\n\ndecisional law regarding policy justifications for limiting supplier liability: “incentivizing\n\nsafer design by rewarding careful manufacturers; the recognition that a verdict for a\n\nplaintiff in a product liability case is tantamount to a determination that an entire product\n\nline is defective, and therefore, the higher threshold of fault is justified; a fault system\n\nincorporates greater intrinsic fairness by not burdening manufacturers and their\n\ncustomers with the cost of insuring against all possible losses; and liberalized modern\n\ndiscovery rules should enable plaintiffs to learn the facts surrounding manufacturers’\n\ndeliberate design decisions.” Id. at 1235 & n.9 (citing Prentis v. Yale Mfg. Co., 365\n\nN.W.2d 176, 185 (Mich. 1984)); see also id. at 1239-40; 1235 n.11 (quoting Wm. A.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 70\n\fWorthington, THE “CITADEL” REVISITED: STRICT TORT LIABILITY AND THE POLICY OF LAW , 36\n\nS. Tex. L. Rev. 227, 250-52 (1995)).\n\n       Going forward, the dissent advocated moving beyond the doctrinal divide\n\nbetween strict liability and negligence principles that was articulated by Azzarello.\n\nAzzarello, according to the dissent, was not reasoned well in its time and has not\n\nwithstood the test of time.       Id. at 1236-37 (criticizing, inter alia, Azzarello Court’s\n\nreliance on Cronin, 501 P.2d 1153, and Glass v. Ford Motor Co., 304 A.2d 562 (N.J.\n\nSuper. Ct. Law Div. 1973)).          The dissent suggested that existing jurisprudence\n\nattempting to justify the doctrinal divide upon loss-spreading and deterrence-based\n\nrationales was stated in “too conclusory terms” and “too powerful” language to be well-\n\nreasoned. “Courts are not experts in manufacturer behavior, and there are equally\n\nreasonable arguments to be made that a negligence-based standard does more to\n\nencourage safer products than an absolute liability scheme.          Moreover, courts and\n\ncommentators have noted that these types of unsupported social policy judgments can\n\nhave tremendous social consequences.” Id. at 1239 (citing Prentis, supra; David G.\n\nOwen, SYMPOSIUM: A TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR DAVID FISCHER: DESIGN DEFECTS, 73 Mo. L.\n\nRev. 291, 296 (2008)). Among the consequences, the dissent noted that when a verdict\n\nfor the plaintiff in a design defect case effectively suggests that an entire product line is\n\ndefective, the consequence may involve a significant portion of a supplier’s assets and\n\ndeprive the public of the product. On a broader scale, such a liability scheme has the\n\npotential to unduly disrupt product investment and innovation. Id.; see also Beard, 41\n\nA.3d at 837 (same). According to the dissent, these potential effects are relevant in any\n\nviable strict liability scheme.\n\n       The dissent recognized some force in the argument that the General Assembly is\n\nbest positioned to alter the existing product liability schema. But, the dissent noted,\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 71\n\fbecause the Legislature had not occupied the arena, which remained in a state of\n\nsubstantial disrepair that had “taken our jurisprudence too far from the legitimate home\n\nof tort law in the concept of corrective justice,” action by the Court was permissible and\n\nnecessary.   “To the degree a distinct category of ‘strict’ product liability doctrine is\n\nnecessary, at most, it always has been, and rationally should be, one of quasi-strict\n\nliability, tempered, in design and warning cases, with the legitimate involvement of\n\nnotions of foreseeability and reasonableness within the purview of the fact finder.” Id. at\n\n1240. The dissent then suggested filling the “substantial void” that would be left by\n\ndisapproval of Azzarello with a prospective movement to the Third Restatement\n\nposition.\n\n       Importantly, as an alternative, the dissent suggested that, while continuing the\n\nsearch for the perfect vehicle by which to devise a replacement strict liability scheme,\n\nthe Court could “at least depart from Azzarello prospectively, thus clearing a path for our\n\ncommon pleas and intermediate appellate courts to consider the reasoned\n\nrecommendations of the Third Restatement, as well as other reasoned alternatives\n\nand/or refinements.”    Bugosh, 942 A.2d at 1241.        This latter approach would be\n\nadequate because the difficulties described by the dissent are with Azzarello rather than\n\nthe Second Restatement itself.       In the dissent’s view, the Court should start by\n\nreaffirming the understanding that “modern products liability law rests fundamentally on\n\nthe premise that manufacturers are fairly held to answer in the courts for the basic\n\nsafety of their products’ designs.” Id. at 1242 (citing Owen, 73 Mo. L. Rev. at 291). The\n\ndissent suggested that, in that scenario, the Legislature could appropriately undertake\n\ntimely, comprehensive reform in light of the broader tools that it has available for\n\nweighing competing interests.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 72\n\f       In 2008, in parallel to the proceedings in Bugosh, the Court denied the request of\n\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for certification of a question of law\n\nrelating to the application under Pennsylvania law of the intended use doctrine to\n\nprevent recovery in strict liability by innocent bystanders. See Berrier, 959 A.2d at 901\n\n(per curiam).        In a concurring statement, Justice Saylor noted his preference for\n\naddressing the global issues pervading strict liability doctrine, before engaging in the\n\ncollateral effects implicated by the certified question. Relating to the application of the\n\nintended user doctrine to limit liability, the concurrence observed that fair compensation\n\nto bystanders was not precluded but, rather, it was channeled into negligence theory,\n\nwhere claims would rise or fall on their merits. Id. (Saylor, J., concurring, joined by\n\nCastille, C.J.).16\n\n       In other relevant developments, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\n\nhas predicted that, if this Court were to directly confront the issue, we would adopt the\n\nThird Restatement’s formulation of the strict liability doctrine. See Berrier, 563 F.3d at\n\n40.   The Third Circuit reasoned that Justice Saylor’s concurring opinion in Phillips\n\nforeshadowed this Court’s adoption of Sections 1 and 2 of the Third Restatement’s\n\ndefinition of the strict liability cause of action. Id. at 53. The Berrier Court went on to\n\napply Third Restatement principles to permit a bystander, as distinguished from a user\n\n16\n       In several recent cases, the Court resolved other claims tangential to\nfundamental concepts of strict liability. See Schmidt, 11 A.3d at 939-41 (implicating\nissues relating to product-line exception to general rule of successor non-liability, and to\nwhether plaintiff must show physical injury as threshold for recovery in strict liability);\nBeard, 41 A.3d 823 (trial courts not restricted to considering single use of multi-use\nproduct in design defect, threshold, risk-utility balancing); Reott v. Asia Trend, Inc., 55\nA.3d 1088 (Pa. 2012) (supplier asserting that injured plaintiff’s “highly reckless conduct”\nis sole and superseding cause of injury must plead and prove claim as affirmative\ndefense); Lance v. Wyeth, 85 A.3d 434 (Pa. 2014) (drug manufacturer subject to liability\nin negligence for design defect).\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 73\n\for consumer, to state a cause of action in strict liability. Id. at 61 (intended user doctrine\n\ndoes not bar strict liability claim; vacating trial court’s decision to grant summary\n\njudgment). See also Covell v. Bell Sports, Inc., 651 F.3d 357 (3d Cir. 2011) (Third\n\nCircuit applies Third Restatement, in accordance with which evidence of industry\n\nstandards is admissible because such evidence is relevant to question of whether\n\nproduct is defective).17\n\n\n\n             C.     The Continuing Viability of Azzarello and Its Progeny\n\n       In this case, the question is posed of whether the rationale of Azzarello, and its\n\nprogeny, should retain viability.    Precedent, of course, is not infallible; if we are to\n\nensure both the perception and the reality of justice, we must be willing to reexamine\n\nprecedent if it is demonstrated that a prior rule does not serve, or no longer adequately\n\nserves, the interests of justice. See Ayala, 305 A.2d at 888; Carney, 79 A.3d at 505.\n\n       Here, the parties agree that the decision in Azzarello articulates governing legal\n\nconcepts which fail to reflect the realities of strict liability practice and to serve the\n\ninterests of justice. Several members of this Court have suggested in the past this very\n\nassessment of Azzarello.        See, e.g., Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1016-18 (Saylor, J.,\n\nconcurring, joined by Castille and Eakin, JJ.); Berrier, 959 A.2d at 901 (Saylor, J.,\n\n\n17\n       Until Berrier, in diversity jurisdiction matters, the Third Circuit applied\nPennsylvania law as articulated in Azzarello. The Third Circuit predicted that this Court\nwould utilize a risk-utility analysis in making the Azzarello threshold determination of\nwhether the risk of loss should be placed on the supplier. The Circuit recognized that\nthis Court had not expressly approved of risk-utility approach in design defect matters;\nthe Third Circuit relied instead upon Superior Court precedent and inquired into\nconsistency with this Court’s pronouncements in existing decisional law. Surace v.\nCaterpillar, Inc., 111 F.3d 1039, 1043-47 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Lewis, supra, and\nDambacher v. Mallis, 485 A.2d 408, 423 n.5 (Pa. Super. 1984)).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 74\n\fconcurring, joined by Castille, C.J.); Bugosh, 971 A.2d at 1236-37 (Saylor, J.,\n\ndissenting, joined by Castille, C.J.).   We agree that reconsideration of Azzarello is\n\nnecessary and appropriate and, to the extent that the pronouncements in Azzarello are\n\nin tension with the principles articulated in this Opinion, the decision in Azzarello is\n\noverruled. We add the following observations.\n\n        As we have noted, Azzarello held that the phrase “unreasonably dangerous” is\n\nper se misleading to lay jurors and, as a result, the Court dictated that any questions\n\nrelating to the risks and utilities of a product are to be decided by the trial court as a\n\nmatter of law and policy.      Moreover, Azzarello approved, and thereby essentially\n\nrequired, instructions which informed the jury that, for the purposes of a supplier’s strict\n\nliability in tort, “the product must, therefore, be provided with every element necessary\n\nto make it safe for its intended) use.” 391 A.2d at 1025 & 1027 n.12. Subsequent\n\ndecisional law has applied Azzarello broadly, to the point of directing that negligence\n\nconcepts have no place in Pennsylvania strict liability doctrine; and, as we explain,\n\nthose decisions essentially led to puzzling trial directives that the bench and bar\n\nunderstandably have had difficulty following in practice, including in the present matter.\n\nCf. Phillips, supra.\n\n        The Azzarello Court premised its broad holding on the assumption that the term\n\n“unreasonably dangerous” is misleading to jurors because it “tends to suggest\n\nconsiderations which are usually identified with the law of negligence.” 391 A.2d at\n\n1025.    Although that general notion had some support in prior observations in\n\nPennsylvania cases, see Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 899-900 (Jones, C.J.), the Azzarello\n\nCourt cemented the notion by focusing on the expression “unreasonably dangerous” out\n\nof the context of the jury charge in which it appeared and pressing upon it a deceptively\n\nsimple, and indeed dogmatic, significance. See Commonwealth v. Murphy, 739 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 75\n\f141, 146 (Pa. 1999) (Court evaluates jury charge to determine whether it is accurate\n\nand clear statement of law; charge is read and considered in its entirety, and its general\n\neffect controls); accord Commonwealth v. Sepulveda, 55 A.3d 1108, 1142 (Pa. 2012);\n\nCommonwealth v. Lesher, 373 A.2d 1088, 1091 (Pa. 1977).\n\n       That the Azzarello Court keyed into a negligence-strict liability dichotomy may be\n\nexplained by the Second Restatement’s explicit reference to negligence in the negative,\n\ni.e., that compensation under Section 402A does not require proof of due care. The\n\nCourt parsed the language of the Second Restatement, particularly the terms “defective\n\ncondition” and “unreasonably dangerous,” for a precise meaning and the reporter’s\n\nintent in the utilization of those terms. See 391 A.2d at 1024-25 (“We must focus upon\n\ntwo requirements set forth in Section 402A for liability (physical injury) that the product\n\nbe ‘in defective condition’ and that it be ‘unreasonably dangerous.’”) (emphasis added).\n\nBut, Section 402A does not articulate legal “requirements” as a statute may; and,\n\nmoreover, the “intent” of the reporter is, of course, not due the same weight as a\n\npronouncement of legislative intent in statutory construction. Any given restatement\n\nsection simply states, or restates, principles of the common law, general rules reflecting\n\na purported consensus, whose validity ultimately depends on the reasoning that\n\nsupports them. Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1385. Yet, the Azzarello Court seemed to engage in\n\na statutory-type construction of Section 402A, including by proceeding to presume every\n\npart of Section 402A effective. The rule derived by Azzarello premised upon this type of\n\nanalysis is that negligence concepts and rhetoric -- although addressed in the negative\n\nby the Restatement -- somehow affected a plaintiff’s burden of proof in all strict liability\n\ncases, regardless of the pertinent facts.\n\n       Speaking in generalities, the Azzarello Court concluded that negligence-related\n\nrhetoric saddles a plaintiff in a strict liability case with an additional and unwarranted\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 76\n\fburden of proof in every case. 391 A.2d at 1025 (quoting Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp.,\n\n501 P.2d 1153, 1161-62 (Cal. 1972)). The facts of Azzarello, when viewed with the\n\nappropriate judicial modesty, did not require such a broad pronouncement. The issue of\n\n“jury confusion” there arose in a distinct, fact-bound context of a jury trial in which claims\n\nof strict liability and counter-claims of negligence were asserted against distinct parties.\n\nThe Azzarello Court offered no explanation of either the nature of the perceived\n\nunwarranted additional burden nor how that burden altered the liability calculus for the\n\nAzzarello jury.   Nor did the Azzarello Court explain the leap in logic necessary to\n\nextrapolate that every lay jury would relate reasonableness and other negligence\n\nterminology, when offered in a strict liability charge, to a “heavier,” negligence-based\n\nburden of proof. Jury charges are generally delivered orally to ordinary citizens, and not\n\nby written transmission to be pored over by scholars or lawyers aware of other forms of\n\nliability not always at issue. See Sepulveda, 55 A.3d at 1142. The concern with across-\n\nthe-board jury confusion, especially where counsel is there to suggest adaptation of\n\nstandard charges and to hear the charge as a whole, is simply overstated. See id.\n\nDistinctions in theories of products liability are no more or less confusing than in other\n\ndifficult areas of law -- note, as but one example, the shifting burdens, levels of proof,\n\nand consensus requirements in the penalty phase of a capital case. It is generally\n\n“incumbent upon the parties, through their attorneys, to aid courts in narrowing issues\n\nand formulating appropriate instructions to guide juries in their factual determinations . .\n\n. .”   Scampone, 57 A.3d at 598.        Yet, the Azzarello Court issued a decision that\n\nconflated a determination of the facts and its related yet distinct conceptual\n\nunderpinnings, which essentially perpetuated jury confusion in future strict liability\n\ncases, rather than dissipating it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 77\n\f        The Azzarello Court found support for its holding not in the Restatement itself, or\n\nin any source of Pennsylvania law, but in the decisions of the Supreme Court of\n\nCalifornia in Cronin, 501 P.2d 1153, and of the New Jersey Superior Court in Glass, 304\n\nA.2d 562. While a broad application of Cronin could support the Azzarello Court’s\n\nformulation, it is notable that the rationale of the decision was explained as significantly\n\nnarrower by latter California Supreme Court decisional law. See Barker, 573 P.2d at\n\n446. Meanwhile, Glass was actually disapproved by the New Jersey Supreme Court in\n\nCepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., 386 A.2d 816, 829 (N.J. 1978), overruled on\n\nother grounds by Suter v. San Angelo Foundry & Mach. Co., 406 A.2d 140 (N.J. 1979)\n\n(superseded in part by statute).        Pennsylvania, unfortunately, did not adjust its\n\njurisprudence in light of these developments that eroded Azzarello’s underpinnings.\n\n        It is also worth noting that Azzarello was distinguishable from Cronin on the facts.\n\nIn Cronin, the defendant challenged on appeal the trial court’s decision to deny an\n\ninstruction to the jury, which provided in pertinent part that, in addition to adducing proof\n\nof a defect, the plaintiff had the burden of proving “[t]hat the defective condition made it\n\nunreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.”            501 P.2d at 1158 n.6.       The\n\ndefendant suggested a distinction between the two elements of proof, reminiscent of\n\nliability for an abnormally dangerous activity, such as blasting. See RESTATEMENT (2D)\n\nOF   TORTS § 519(1) (“One who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject\n\nto liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of another resulting from the activity,\n\nalthough he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm.”) (emphasis added);\n\nsee also id. §§ 520-524A. The Cronin Court rejected the defendant’s challenge to the\n\njury instructions, on the ground that it placed an unwarranted burden of proof on the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 78\n\f       Importantly, decisional law eschews the Cronin defendant’s application of\n\nSection 402A, and the causes of action in strict liability for products and for an\n\nabnormally dangerous activity are recognized as carrying distinct burdens for the\n\nplaintiff. By comparison, in Azzarello, the error of which the plaintiff complained on\n\nappeal was that speaking of reasonableness in a jury instruction issued in a case in\n\nwhich only negligence allegations were made against a cross-defendant/employer\n\ntended to mislead the jury as to the plaintiff’s burden of proof in its own distinct strict\n\nliability case against the defendant/manufacturer.       While similar considerations may\n\nhave been pertinent, certainly a nuanced analysis of the Cronin decision in the context\n\nof the Azzarello arguments would have served for better generalized guidance to the\n\nbench and bar.\n\n       This case speaks volumes to the necessity of reading legal rules -- especially\n\nbroad rules -- against their facts and the corollary that judicial pronouncements should\n\nemploy due modesty. See Maloney, 984 A.2d at 489–90 (“For one thing, it is very\n\ndifficult for courts to determine the range of factual circumstances to which a particular\n\nrule should apply in light of the often myriad possibilities”; of particular concern is “the\n\npossibility that words or phrases or sentences may be taken out of context and treated\n\nas doctrines.”). As courts have struggled with the application of the deceptively simple\n\nAzzarello rule that a jury must be insulated from negligence concepts and rhetoric in\n\nstrict liability cases, decisional law has lapsed into an arguably unprincipled formulaic\n\napplication of rhetoric, threatening to render the strict liability cause of action hopelessly\n\nunmoored in modern circumstances.\n\n       Compounding the problem of extrapolating broad lessons from very particular\n\ncircumstances, the Azzarello Court accomplished its goal of insulating juries from\n\nnegligence concepts and rhetoric by: (1) holding that the determination “as to the risk of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 79\n\floss” is a decision to be made by the trial court rather than the jury; and (2) “approving”\n\njury instructions in strict liability cases generally. The Court explained this decision by\n\nsaying that: “While a lay finder of fact is obviously competent in resolving a dispute as to\n\nthe condition of a product, an entirely different question is presented where a decision\n\nas to whether that condition justifies placing liability upon the supplier must be made.”\n\nThe Court then suggested that it is within the trial court’s bailiwick to answer questions\n\nof law whose resolution “depends upon social policy” such as: “Should an ill-conceived\n\ndesign which exposes the user to the risk of harm entitle one injured by the product to\n\nrecover? Should adequate warnings of the dangerous propensities of an article insulate\n\none who suffers injuries from those propensities? When does the utility of a product\n\noutweigh the unavoidable danger it may pose?” According to the Court, “[i]t is a judicial\n\nfunction to decide whether, under plaintiff’s averment of the facts, recovery would be\n\njustified; and only after this judicial determination is made is the cause submitted to the\n\njury to determine whether the facts of the case support the averments of the complaint.\n\nThey do not fall within the orbit of a factual dispute which is properly assigned to the jury\n\nfor resolution.” Without further explanation of these broad assumptions, bottomed on\n\nnotions of social policy, the Court concluded that “[a] standard suggesting the existence\n\nof a ‘defect’ if the article is unreasonably dangerous or not duly safe is inadequate to\n\nguide a lay jury” and adopted in its stead a formulation by which the seller would be held\n\nliable unless the seller “provide[d] with the product every element necessary to make it\n\nsafe for use.” 391 A.2d at 1025-27 (quoting Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 902 (Jones, C.J.)).\n\nThe 1987 decision in Lewis acknowledged Azzarello’s innovation, noting that it offered a\n\ndistinct standard from either a risk-utility test or a consumer expectation test. 528 A.2d\n\nat 593.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 80\n\f        The Azzarello Court attributed the new standard of proof to the one-justice lead\n\nopinion of Chief Justice Jones in Berkebile, which the Court quoted out of context.\n\nAdditionally, the endorsed jury charge significantly altered the import of the Berkebile\n\npassage. Compare Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 902 (Jones, C.J.) (emphasis added) (“seller\n\nmust provide with the product every element necessary to make it safe for use”;\n\nnotion of defect includes claim for failure to warn, in addition to claims for manufacturing\n\nand design defects) (emphasis added) with Azzarello, 391 A.2d at 1027 n.12 (“product\n\nmust, therefore, be provided with every element necessary to make it safe for (its\n\nintended) use, and without any condition that makes it unsafe for (its intended) use”)\n\n(emphasis added).        Predictably, the “approval” of such jury instructions operated to\n\ndiscourage the exercise of judicial discretion in charging the jury, including in the\n\nTinchers’ case, and likely stunted the development of the common law in this area from\n\nproceeding in a more logical, experience-based and reason-bound fashion. See, e.g.,\n\nN.T., 10/20/2010, at 825 (emphasis added).\n\n        The greater difficulty is that the Azzarello standard is impracticable.        As an\n\nillustration of its new standard’s application, the Azzarello Court offered that a supplier is\n\nnot an insurer of a product, although it is a guarantor; these terms of art, with no further\n\nexplanation of their practical import, also mirrored the standard jury charge approved by\n\nAzzarello.     The Court did not purport to articulate a departure from the Second\n\nRestatement formulation, nor did it discuss the reasoning for or implications of doing so.\n\nYet, the Azzarello Court chose this iteration of the law to fill the legal void caused by its\n\nbright-line rule that any negligence rhetoric carries an undue risk of misleading lay jurors\n\nin strict liability cases.\n\n        Omega Flex, subscribing to existing criticism of this scheme, faults Azzarello for\n\n(1) removing from the jury the risk-utility calculus implicated in what Azzarello called “the\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 81\n\frisk of loss” determination; and (2) requiring the trial court to make the determination\n\nbefore the facts even are in evidence, premised merely upon the plaintiff’s allegations\n\nand with all inferences benefitting the plaintiff. Although the argument is not explicitly\n\nmade to this Court, the obvious suggestion is that the scheme burdens the defendant’s\n\nright to a fair jury trial. Setting aside any potential, but here unpreserved, due process\n\nor right to a jury claims, the unsupported assumptions and conclusory statements upon\n\nwhich Azzarello’s directives are built are problematic on their face.\n\n       First, the notion that a legal inquiry into “whether that condition justifies placing\n\nliability upon the supplier” (product is unreasonably dangerous) is, albeit distinguishable,\n\nentirely separable from a factual inquiry into the predicate “condition of a product”\n\n(defective condition of product) when determining whether to affix liability upon a\n\nsupplier is incompatible with basic principles of strict liability. Thus, in a jurisdiction\n\nfollowing the Second Restatement formulation of strict liability in tort, the critical inquiry\n\nin affixing liability is whether a product is “defective”; in the context of a strict liability\n\nclaim, whether a product is defective depends upon whether that product is\n\n“unreasonably dangerous.” Yet, Azzarello divorced one inquiry from the other: under\n\nthe Azzarello scheme, the trial court serves as the gate-keeper of one question with the\n\napparent task of deciding as a matter of law and policy whether a product is one even\n\nsusceptible to a strict liability claim. As a practical matter, the Azzarello decision did not\n\nindicate at which point of the trial the court should consider the question, nor what\n\npleadings or evidence would be relevant to the inquiry; the Court did suggest, however,\n\nthat the matter “d[id] not fall within the orbit of a factual dispute.” 391 A.2d at 1026.\n\n       Second, the practical reality, as exemplified by the matter before us, is that trial\n\ncourts simply do not necessarily have the expertise to conduct the social policy inquiry\n\ninto the risks and utilities of a plethora of products and to decide, as a matter of law,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 82\n\fwhether a product is unreasonably dangerous except perhaps in the most obvious of\n\ncases (e.g., where injury is caused by a knife), where a gate-keeper’s function is hardly\n\nnecessary.    In this case, Omega Flex moved for summary judgment before trial, a\n\nnonsuit after the close of the Tinchers’ case, and then renewed the motion for a nonsuit\n\nafter both parties rested, asking the court to determine whether the TracPipe System\n\nwas unreasonably dangerous. Although the trial court denied all motions, the court\n\naddressed the merits of the risk-utility calculus on the record only in the context of the\n\nmotions for nonsuit. See N.T., 10/18/2010, at 514-15 (“The [trial c]ourt had denied the\n\n[summary judgment] motion, presumably, although I don’t know for sure, because it\n\nthought this might be an issue of fact that needed to be heard at trial.”). Given the\n\nopportunity to rule on Omega Flex’s motions for nonsuit, the trial court reviewed the\n\nevidence introduced at trial before denying the motions, in addition to evidence deemed\n\ninadmissible at trial -- i.e., proof of a redesigned TracPipe System, marketed as\n\n“Counterstrike,” that was resistant to lightning strikes. See id. at 514-26 & 721-41; Tr.\n\nCt. Op., 8/5/2011, at 11-20. This matter illustrates that the assumptions upon which the\n\nAzzarello Court assigned the task of determining whether a product is unreasonably\n\ndangerous are impractical. In the alternative, a strict reading of Azzarello is undesirable\n\nbecause it would encourage trial courts to make either uninformed or unfounded\n\ndecisions of social policy that then substantially determine the course and outcome of\n\nthe trial.\n\n        Subsequent application of Azzarello elevated the notion that negligence concepts\n\ncreate confusion in strict liability cases to a doctrinal imperative, whose merits were not\n\nexamined to determine whether such a bright-line rule was consistent with reason in\n\nlight of the considerations pertaining to the case. Beyond the merits of the narrow\n\nholdings in the several cases, the effect of the per se rule that negligence rhetoric and\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 83\n\fconcepts were to be eliminated from strict liability law was to validate the suggestion\n\nthat the cause of action, so shaped, was not viable, and to invite calls for reform. In\n\n2009, the Third Circuit predicted that this Court would simply adopt the Third\n\nRestatement approach to the strict liability doctrine; this Court has not taken that\n\ndecisional leap.\n\n\n\n         D.     The Strict Product Liability Cause of Action in Pennsylvania\n\n       Overruling Azzarello leaves a gap, going forward, in our strict liability\n\njurisprudence. The preferable solution may be to have the General Assembly address\n\nthis arena of substantive law.       But, so long as the possibility of comprehensive\n\nlegislative reform remains unlikely or uncertain, this Court retains the authority and duty\n\nat common law to take necessary action to avoid injustice, uncertainty, delay, and the\n\npossibility of different standards and procedures being employed in different courtrooms\n\nthroughout the Commonwealth. Accord Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 36 A.3d 24, 52\n\n(Pa. 2011); see also Bugosh, 971 A.2d at 1240 & n.19 (Saylor, J., dissenting, joined by\n\nCastille, C.J.) (addressing legislative and judicial roles in strict liability arena). This is\n\nparticularly so when the underlying problem derives from our own decisional law. The\n\nCourt is positioned to take the necessary corrective action in this matter and offer\n\nguidance. See, e.g., Ayala, 305 A.2d at 883 (doctrine of immunity judicially imposed\n\nmay be judicially terminated) (quoting Molitor v. Kaneland Community Unit Dist. No.\n\n302, 163 N.E.2d 89, 96 (Ill. 1959) (“‘Having found that doctrine to be unsound and\n\nunjust under present conditions, we consider that we have not only the power, but the\n\nduty, to abolish that immunity. We closed our courtroom doors without legislative help,\n\nand we can likewise open them.’”)); see also Mayle v. Pa. Dep’t of Highways, 388 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 84\n\f709, 720 (Pa. 1978) (Court may abolish judicial doctrine of sovereign immunity, which is\n\nmanifestly unfair and non-constitutional in origin).\n\n        Strict liability in tort for product defects is a cause of action which implicates the\n\nsocial and economic policy of this Commonwealth. See Ash v. Continental Ins. Co.,\n\n932 A.2d 877, 884 (Pa. 2007) (“Tort actions lie for breaches of duties imposed by law as\n\na matter of social policy, while contract actions lie only for breaches of duties imposed\n\nby mutual consensus agreements between particular individuals.”).18 The policy was\n\narticulated by the concurring and dissenting opinion of Justice Jones in Miller, upon\n\nwhich the Webb Court relied in “adopting” the strict liability theory as a distinct cause of\n\naction in tort: those who sell a product (i.e., profit from making and putting a product in\n\nthe stream of commerce) are held responsible for damage caused to a consumer by the\n\nreasonable use of the product. See Miller, 221 A.2d at 334-35 (Jones, J., concurring\n\nand dissenting). The risk of injury is placed, therefore, upon the supplier of products.\n\nAzzarello, 391 A.2d at 1023-24; accord Ellen Wertheimer, UNKNOWABLE DANGERS               AND\n\nTHE   DEATH OF STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, 60 U. Cin. L. Rev.\n\n1183, 1184-85 (1992).        No product is expressly exempt and, as a result, the\n\npresumption is that strict liability may be available with respect to any product, provided\n\n18\n       Because the strict liability cause of action developed at common law, relevant\npolicy justifications are derived from decisional law and scholarly commentary. As\nnoted, the General Assembly has not spoken affirmatively in relation to the strict liability\ncause of action, although the Commonwealth has expressed its interest in protecting\nconsumers in several arenas by statute. See, e.g., Act 387 of 1968, P.L. 1224\n(reenacted as Act 260 of 1976, P.L. 1166) (the “Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer\nProtection Law”). The fair presumption arising from the General Assembly refraining for\n50 years from acting otherwise is that the General Assembly has at least acquiesced in\nthe existence of the common law strict liability cause of action. See Everhart, 938 A.2d\nat 307; compare Phoenixville Hosp. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd. (Shoap), 81 A.3d\n830, 834-35 (Pa. 2013) (General Assembly amended statute to address gap which, in\ninterim nine years, had been governed by common law).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 85\n\fthat the evidence is sufficient to prove a defect. See RESTATEMENT (2D)         OF   TORTS §\n\n402A cmt. b (cause of action in strict liability “cover[s] the sale of any product which, if\n\nit should prove to be defective, may be expected to cause physical harm to the\n\nconsumer or his property”) (emphasis added); accord Prosser, 69 Yale L. J. 1103-04;\n\nbut see Hahn v. Richter, 673 A.2d 888 (Pa. 1996) (manufacturer immune from strict\n\nliability defective design claim premised upon sale of prescription drugs without\n\nadequate warning).\n\n       A broad reading of this policy statement suggests that liability would attach\n\nabsolutely, once the consumer or user suffers harm; indeed, early proponents\n\nsupported such an application. See, e.g., Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno,\n\n150 P.2d 436, 440 (Cal. 1944) (Traynor, J., concurring) (“In my opinion it should now be\n\nrecognized that a manufacturer incurs an absolute liability when an article that he has\n\nplaced on the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection, proves to have a\n\ndefect that causes injury to human beings.”). But, experience has taught otherwise and,\n\nin modern application, strict liability doctrine is a substantially narrower theory. Prosser,\n\n69 Yale L. J. at 1143-46 (“Few products can ever be made entirely safe, and the\n\nproducer cannot be made an insurer of every one who may possibly be hurt.”).\n\n       To explain its proper boundaries post-Azzarello, we address the fundamental\n\nunderpinnings of the cause of action: the duty imposed by law and what constitutes a\n\nbreach of the duty; and we also advert to additional matters such as causation,\n\ndamages, defenses, and effects on other doctrines where necessary.\n\n\n\n                                     1.     The Duty\n\n       “Tort actions lie for breaches of duties imposed by law as a matter of social policy\n\n. . . .” Ash, 932 A.2d at 884. Since the tide turned with New York’s 1916 MacPherson\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 86\n\fdecision,19 all American jurisdictions have accepted the existence of a duty in tort\n\narising from the supplier-consumer relationship.         Disagreement among jurisdictions\n\nremains in defining the nature of that duty. Thus, the policy of some jurisdictions is that\n\nthose who engage in the business of selling a product are subject to a duty of due care\n\nin manufacturing and selling the product.        See, e.g., Prentis, 365 N.W.2d at 186\n\n(Michigan).20 By comparison, the policy of those jurisdictions that have incorporated the\n\nSecond Restatement into their common law is that those who engage in the business of\n\nselling a product are subject to both a duty of care in manufacturing and selling the\n\nproduct and a duty to sell a product free from a “defective condition.” The duty spoken\n\nof in strict liability is intended to be distinct from the duty of due care in negligence.\n\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A(2).\n\n       The duty in strict liability pertains to the duty of a manufacturer and of suppliers in\n\nthe chain of distribution to the ultimate consumer. The Restatement offers a functional\n\nshorthand for the balancing of interests implicit in assessing the existence of the strict\n\nliability duty in tort between those in a consumer/user-supplier relationship.           See\n\nScampone, 57 A.3d at 606; cf. Althaus v. Cohen, 756 A.2d 1166, 1169 (Pa. 2000)\n\n(recognizing balancing calculus implicit in determining whether therapist owed parents\n\n\n19\n      MacPherson, supra, 217 N.Y. at 389 (“[i]f the nature of a thing is such that it is\nreasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing\nof danger”; discarding requirement to prove that product was inherently dangerous (e.g.,\n“poisons, explosives, and things of like nature”) to obtain compensation for harm caused\nby negligent conduct).\n\n20\n       But, even the development of the proper bounds of the duty of care was not\nwithout decades-long growing pains. See generally Martin v. Herzog, 126 N.E. 814\n(N.Y. 1920); Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928); The No. 1 of New\nYork, 61 F.2d 783 (2d Cir. 1932); Sinram v. Pennsylvania R.

In incorporating the strict liability cause of\n\naction into Pennsylvania common law, the Webb Court expressly relied upon the\n\nSecond Restatement and relevant scholarly commentary to supply its justification. 220\n\nA.2d at 854.       Indeed, comments b, c, g, and m to Section 402A of the Second\n\nRestatement offer reasoned consideration of factors relevant in Pennsylvania to explain\n\nthe existence and nature of a seller’s duty in tort to a consumer. In part, comment c\n\nexplains that:\n\n                          [A] seller, by marketing his product for use and\n                 consumption, has undertaken and assumed a special\n                 responsibility toward any member of the consuming public\n                 who may be injured by it; that public has a right to and does\n                 expect, in [the] case of products which it needs and for which\n                 it is forced to rely upon the seller, that reputable sellers will\n                 stand behind their goods; that public policy demands that the\n                 burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for\n                 consumption be placed upon those who market them, and\n                 be treated as a cost of production against which liability\n                 insurance can be obtained; and that consumer of such\n                 products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the\n                 hands of someone, and proper persons to afford it are those\n                 who market the products.\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A cmt. c.\n\n       This reasoning explains the nature of the non-delegable duty articulated by the\n\nSecond Restatement and recognized in Webb. Stated affirmatively, a person or entity\n\nengaged in the business of selling a product has a duty to make and/or market the\n\nproduct -- which “is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without\n\nsubstantial change in the condition in which it is sold” -- free from “a defective condition\n\nunreasonably dangerous to the consumer or [the consumer’s] property.”                Accord\n\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 88\n\f                                   2.      Breach of Duty\n\n       Where a duty exists and, in the absence of a recognized immunity, the duty is\n\nbreached, and the breach of the duty is causally connected to a compensable injury\n\nresults, a tortious act results, regardless of whether the tortious act is construed\n\ncolloquially as fault. Compare Welch v. Outboard Marine Corp., 481 F.2d 252, 256 (5th\n\nCir. 1973) (“Fault as the violation of a duty -- even in the absence of negligence --\n\nagrees with civilian principles generally . . . .”) with Putman, 338 F.2d at 913 n.8\n\n(“[W]arranty (unlike negligence which is a tort concept based on fault) is not a concept\n\nbased on fault or on the failure to exercise reasonable care. But this does not mean\n\nthat warranty is necessarily contractual or non-tortious in nature.”). To demonstrate a\n\nbreach of duty in a strict liability matter, a plaintiff must prove that a seller (manufacturer\n\nor distributor) placed on the market a product in a “defective condition.”\n\n       In this context, the concept of defective condition is a legal term of art, which\n\ndenotes neither its colloquial import nor a scientifically immutable fact.           “The term\n\n‘defect’ in design cases is ‘an epithet -- an expression for the legal conclusion rather\n\nthan a test for reaching that conclusion.’” Prentis, 365 N.W.2d at 182 (quoting John W.\n\nWade, ON PRODUCT “DESIGN DEFECTS”           AND   THEIR ACTIONABILITY, 33 Van. L. Rev. 551,\n\n552 (1980)); accord John W. Wade, ON              THE   NATURE   OF   STRICT TORT LIABILITY   FOR\n\nPRODUCTS, 44 Miss. L.J. 825, 831-32 (1973) (see infra n.21).                  Stated otherwise,\n\nevidentiary considerations (e.g., what evidence tends to prove the existence of a legal\n\ndefect) should not be mistaken for the question of whether a substantive duty in strict\n\nliability exists or should exist, or what constitutes a breach of that duty.            Accord\n\nScampone, 57 A.3d at 606 (evidence of whether nursing home was similar to hospital\n\nnot dispositive of whether nursing home owed patient substantive duty in tort); Gilbert v.\n\nKorvette, Inc., 327 A.2d 94, 96-97 (Pa. 1974) (correcting confusion regarding res ipsa\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 89\n\floquitur doctrine, which was “conceived as a shorthand statement of the evidentiary rule\n\nallowing negligence to be established by circumstantial proof” but erroneously\n\ndeveloped into heightened burden of proving duty of care).            In Pennsylvania, the\n\nquestion of whether those who make or market products have duties in strict liability (in\n\naddition to negligence) has been answered in the affirmative by the 1966 decision in\n\nWebb. The question which has proven substantially more difficult has been one of\n\nproof: what evidence is relevant to prove a “defective condition” and how should that\n\nevidence be weighed.\n\n\n\n                3.     The Standard of Proving “Defective Condition”\n\n                      In the Context of a Design-Related Claim21\n\n       Not least because of its colloquial use and attendant implications of a scientific\n\nlevel of certainty, courts across jurisdictions have struggled to articulate the legal notion\n\nof “defect” in a way that would account for such an alleged condition, encompassing the\n\nmyriad products on the market, in a way that can effectively resonate with a jury. The\n\ndifficulty persists particularly with respect to defects in design. See Bugosh, 971 A.2d at\n\n1234 (Saylor, J., dissenting); see also Owen, 73 Mo. L. Rev. at 291-92 & n.2 (citing\n\ncases from other jurisdictions).     Dean John W. Wade22 explained the difficulty as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n21\n       Our decision is limited to the context of a “design defect” claim by the facts of this\nmatter, albeit the foundational principles upon which we touch may ultimately have\nbroader implications by analogy.\n\n22\n      John W. Wade was dean of Vanderbilt University’s law school from 1952 to\n1971, and a senior authority in the publication of the case law book “Prosser, Wade and\nSchwartz’s Torts, Cases and Materials.”\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 90\n\f                     [T]he term “defective” raises many difficulties. Its\n              natural application would be limited to the situation in which\n              something went wrong in the manufacturing process, so that\n              the article was defective in the sense that the manufacturer\n              had not intended it to be in that condition. To apply it also to\n              the case in which a warning is not attached to the chattel or\n              the design turns out to be a bad one or the product is likely\n              to be injurious in its normal condition, is to use the term in a\n              Pickwickian sense, with a special, esoteric meaning of its\n              own. It is not without reason that some people, in writing\n              about it, speak of the requirement of being “legally\n              defective,” including the quotation marks. To have to define\n              the term to the jury, with a meaning completely different from\n              the one they would normally give to it, is to create the\n              chance that they will be misled. To use it without defining it\n              to the jury is almost to ensure that they will be misled. . . .\n              Finally, the term “defective” gives an illusion of certainty by\n              suggesting a word with a purported specific meaning rather\n              than a term connoting a standard involving the weighing of\n              factors.\nPhillips, 841 A.2d 1017-18 (Saylor, J., concurring) (quoting Wade, 44 Miss. L. J. at 831-\n\n32) (footnote omitted).\n\n       In addressing the disputed notion of “defective condition,” we start with the\n\nassumption that, as with any other tort relationship, the supplier and the consumer are\n\nprotecting legitimate but conflicting interests; the purpose of the court at common law is\n\nto evaluate the interests and articulate the principles based upon where the line is\n\ndrawn in individual cases. See Glenn v. Point Park Coll., 272 A.2d 895, 899 (Pa. 1971).\n\nIn any particular case, argumentation by a party -- with whatever creative flair is offered\n\n-- seeks to give ascendancy to that party’s interests; the most persuasive arguments\n\nadvance the interests of all parties, preferably in actuality but often simply in\n\nappearance. The role of the court in deciding questions of law, and dispositive motions,\n\nis to assess the validity of the argumentation and test it against the facts, the governing\n\nlaw, policy, and reason. The court’s process “results in according or denying a privilege\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 91\n\fwhich, in turn, determines liability.” Id. In articulating rules at common law in this area,\n\nthen, we also outline the socially acceptable bounds of a product’s danger that form the\n\npredicate for conduct which the law regards as privileged. See id. This function helps\n\nto ensure regularity and predictability in the processes of law.\n\n       In the products liability arena, the individual consumer or user of the product\n\nretains primary interests in the safe continued use of a product and, relatedly, in the\n\ncost of any injury caused by the product.        See Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1387 (quoting\n\nRESTATEMENT (2D)    OF   TORTS § 402A cmt. c). The consumer has additional economic,\n\nmoral, and visceral interests in the sales price of the product, the availability of new or\n\ninnovative products, and in any spillover effects (e.g., increased social welfare and\n\nreduced strain on public resources related to fewer injuries and improved health;\n\nincreased employment, investment opportunities, value of shareholder equity). Accord,\n\ne.g., Tooey v. AK Steel Corp., 81 A.3d 851, 857 (Pa. 2013) (cost of workers’\n\ncompensation scheme is paid by employer but, ultimately, passed on to consuming\n\npublic). These interests are also shared by members of the public generally, albeit\n\nmore diffusely. For the individual supplier, the assumed primary interest is to generate\n\na sustained profit, above the cost of doing business. Accord Wertheimer, 60 U. Cin. L.\n\nRev. at 1185. A supplier also retains complementary economic interests in maintaining\n\na reputable name and in providing new or innovative products, which requires, among\n\nother things, financial flexibility beyond mere profitability. See Beard, 41 A.3d at 837 &\n\nn.16; Miller, 221 A.2d at 334-35 (Second Restatement reflects expectation that\n\nmanufacturers and sellers will stand behind their products). Another motivating factor\n\nmay be a moral interest in providing a safe product with minimal negative externalities\n\nor spillover effects (e.g., environmental impact). Concomitantly, suppliers across the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 92\n\fsame and/or related industries may share similar, albeit diluted, interests regarding\n\nprofitability and reputability on industry-wide bases.23\n\n       As they have been passed down to the present, the common law principles that\n\ndelineate the strict liability cause of action, and the limits upon strict liability, reflect a\n\nbalance of interests respecting what is socially or economically desirable.            Accord\n\nWhitner v. Von Hintz, 263 A.2d 889, 893 (Pa. 1970) (common law notion of “proximate\n\ncause” allows periodic adjustment between recovery for wrong and limits upon liability\n\nto advance desirable policy outcomes).          The calculus is sensitive to the varying\n\nmagnitude of the interests and, sometimes perversely, to the force with which each\n\ninterest is asserted from time to time. Compare Escola, 150 P.2d at 441 (Traynor, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an\n\noverwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury\n\ncan be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing\n\nbusiness.”); Prosser, 69 Yale L. J. at 1119-22 (rejecting idea that “liability should never\n\nrest upon anything but fault,” as “a position certainly out of date in this day and\n\ngeneration”) with Bugosh, 971 A.2d at 1235 & n.9 (Saylor, J., dissenting) (citing Prentis,\n\n365 N.W.2d at 185) (justifications for limiting liability include: “incentivizing safer design\n\nby rewarding careful manufacturers; the recognition that a verdict for a plaintiff in a\n\n23\n       The more diffuse industry-wide and public interests are represented by the\nseveral amici curiae filing briefs in this matter.

Other jurisdictions and the Third Restatement\n\nhave combined the two standards. See generally Owen, 73 Mo. L. Rev. at 299-300.\n\nWe describe the alternatives.\n\n\n\n                           Consumer Expectations Standard\n\n       The consumer expectations test defines a “defective condition” as a condition,\n\nupon normal use, dangerous beyond the reasonable consumer’s contemplations. See,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 94\n\fe.g., Welch, 481 F.2d at 254; see also David G. Owen, PRODUCTS LIABILITY LAW , at § 5.6\n\n(Hornbook Series) (2d ed. 2008) (hereinafter referred to as “Owen, HORNBOOK”)\n\n(describing provenance and alternative formulations). The test offers a standard of\n\nconsumer expectations which, in typical common law terms, states that: the product is\n\nin a defective condition if the danger is unknowable and unacceptable to the average or\n\nordinary consumer.         See Welch, 481 F.2d at 254 (“A product is defective and\n\nunreasonably dangerous[, inter alia,] if the risks are greater than a reasonable buyer\n\nwould expect.”). The test has been described as reflecting the “surprise element of\n\ndanger.” Owen, HORNBOOK, at 303 n.12 (quoting Hon. Roger Traynor, THE W AYS          AND\n\nMEANINGS    OF   DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS     AND   STRICT LIABILITY, 32 Tenn. L. Rev. 363, 370\n\n(1965)).   The product is not defective if the ordinary consumer would reasonably\n\nanticipate and appreciate the dangerous condition of the product and the attendant risk\n\nof injury of which the plaintiff complains (e.g., a knife). See Vincer v. Esther Williams\n\nAll-Aluminum Swimming Pool Co., 230 N.W.2d 794, 798 (Wis. 1975); see also\n\nRESTATEMENT (2D)      OF   TORTS § 402A cmt. i (“The article sold must be dangerous to an\n\nextent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who\n\npurchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its\n\ncharacteristics.”).   The nature of the product, the identity of the user, the product’s\n\nintended use and intended user, and any express or implied representations by a\n\nmanufacturer or other seller are among considerations relevant to assessing the\n\nreasonable consumer’s expectations. See, e.g., Mikolajczyk, 901 N.E.2d at 336; Jarke\n\nv. Jackson Prods., 631 N.E.2d 233, 238-40 (Ill. App. 1st Dist. 1994); Owen, HORNBOOK,\n\nat 303, 307-09; see also RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A cmt. i (“Good butter is not\n\nunreasonably dangerous merely because, if such be the case, it deposits cholesterol in\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 95\n\fthe arteries and leads to heart attacks; but bad butter, contaminated with poisonous fish\n\noil, is unreasonably dangerous.”).\n\n       The language of the consumer expectations test derives from the Second\n\nRestatement’s commentary on the principles designated to limit liability, i.e., “defective\n\ncondition” and “unreasonably dangerous.” RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A cmts. g\n\n& i. Several commentators have suggested that this test reflects the warranty law roots\n\nof strict liability in tort, and serves to vindicate significant interests central to the public\n\npolicy justifying the strict liability cause of action in the first place:\n\n\n                       Powerful reasons support protections of a consumer’s\n               expectations of product safety that arise from the safety\n               representations of a manufacturer or other seller, whether\n               those representations be express or implied. When making\n               safety “promises” in an effort to sell its products, a\n               manufacturer seeks to convince potential buyers that its\n               affirmations are both valuable and true. Safety information is\n               valuable to users because it provides a “frame of reference”\n               that permits a user to shift his or her limited cognitive and\n               other resources away from self-protection toward the pursuit\n               of other goals -- which in turn shifts responsibility for\n               protecting the user to the manufacturer. In this manner, true\n               safety information adds value to the product by enhancing\n               the user’s autonomy, for which value the consumer fairly\n               pays a price. So, if the information is not true but false, the\n               purchaser loses significant autonomy, as well as the benefit\n               of the bargain. Since an important purpose of the law is to\n               promote autonomy, and the equality of the buyer to the seller\n               as reflected in their deal, the law fairly may demand that the\n               seller rectify the underlying falsity and resulting inequality in\n               the exchange transaction if harm results.\nOwen, HORNBOOK, at 303 (footnote omitted); compare Putman, 338 F.2d at 913 n.8\n\n(“Liability in warranty arises where damage is caused by the failure of a product to\n\nmeasure up to express or implied representations on the part of the manufacturer or\n\nother supplier.”).\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 96\n\f       Application of the consumer expectations test in its purest form, however, has\n\ntheoretical and practical limitations. First, products whose danger is obvious or within\n\nthe ordinary consumer’s contemplation would be exempt from strict liability; some\n\ntherefore have said that related consumer safety expectations regarding the presence\n\nof the danger are too low. See, e.g., Ahrens v. Ford Motor Co., 340 F.3d 1142 (10th\n\nCir. 2003) (affirming district court decision that manufacturer not liable for defective\n\ndesign of tractor without seatbelt or for failing to warn of danger because plaintiff failed\n\nto adduce sufficient evidence that risk of danger was beyond contemplation of ordinary\n\nconsumer).    Second, a product whose danger is vague or outside the ordinary\n\nconsumer’s contemplation runs the risk of being subjected to arbitrary application of the\n\nstrict liability doctrine; jury determinations of consumer expectations regarding the\n\npresence of danger are unpredictable. This difficulty is characteristic of products of\n\nrelatively complex design. See, e.g., Heaton v. Ford Motor Co., 435 P.2d 806 (Or.\n\n1967). The Heaton Court explained:\n\n                     [A product] should be strong enough to perform as the\n              ordinary consumer expects. . . . The jury is supposed to\n              determine the basically factual question of what reasonable\n              consumers do expect from the product. Where the jury has\n              no experiential basis for knowing this, the record must\n              supply such a basis. In the absence of either common\n              experience or evidence, any verdict would, in effect, be the\n              jury’s opinion of how strong the product [s]hould be. Such\n              an opinion by the jury would be formed without the benefit of\n              data concerning the cost or feasibility of designing and\n              building stronger products. Without reference to relevant\n              factual data, the jury has no special qualifications for\n              deciding what is reasonable.\nId. at 809; see also Soule v. Gen. Motors Corp., 882 P.2d 298, 308 (Cal. 1994) (“[A]\n\ncomplex product, even when it is being used as intended, may often cause injury in a\n\nway that does not engage its ordinary consumers’ reasonable minimum assumptions\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 97\n\fabout safe performance. For example, the ordinary consumer of an automobile simply\n\nhas ‘no idea’ how it should perform in all foreseeable situations, or how safe it should be\n\nmade against all foreseeable hazards.”).\n\n       The consumer expectations test, because of the “obvious defect” exception and\n\nvagueness concerns, has practical limitations in vindicating the basic public policy\n\nundergirding strict liability, i.e., that those who sell a product are held responsible for\n\ndamage caused to a consumer despite the reasonable use of the product and that any\n\nproduct is, presumptively, subject to liability on a theory of strict liability premised upon\n\nthis policy. See Miller, 221 A.2d at 334-35 (Jones, J., concurring and dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                  Risk-Utility Standard\n\n       The difficulty related to vindicating the salient public policy in cases in which the\n\nalleged defective condition is premised upon either an obvious danger or a danger\n\noutside the ordinary consumer’s contemplation suggests that a different approach is\n\nnecessary and appropriate for judging the reasonableness of danger, at least respecting\n\nsome products. American jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, apply a test balancing\n\nrisks and utilities or, stated in economic terms, a cost-benefit analysis. See Owen,\n\nHORNBOOK, at § 5.7; Azzarello, 391 A.2d at 1026. The test offers a standard which, in\n\ntypical common law terms, states that: a product is in a defective condition if a\n\n“reasonable person” would conclude that the probability and seriousness of harm\n\ncaused by the product outweigh the burden or costs of taking precautions. See, e.g.,\n\nDenny v. Ford Motor Co., 662 N.E.2d 730, 735 (N.Y. 1995); Barker, 573 P.2d at 456;\n\naccord Welch, 481 F.2d at 256 (product is defective if reasonable seller would not sell\n\nproduct knowing of risks involved). Stated otherwise, a seller’s precautions to advert\n\nthe danger should anticipate and reflect the type and magnitude of the risk posed by the\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 98\n\fsale and use of the product.        See Owen, HORNBOOK, at 315 (risk-utility standard\n\n“demands that manufacturers adopt precautions proportionate to the magnitude of the\n\nexpected risk”).\n\n       The risk-utility test offers courts an opportunity to analyze post hoc whether a\n\nmanufacturer’s conduct in manufacturing or designing a product was reasonable, which\n\nobviously reflects the negligence roots of strict liability. See Blue v. Envt’l Eng’g, Inc.,\n\n828 N.E.2d 1128, 1140-41 (Ill. 2005) (“[I]t has been observed that the kind of hindsight\n\nanalysis inherent in the risk-utility test, which requires juries to weigh the risk inherent in\n\nthe product's design, has all the earmarks of determining negligence.”); see also U.S. v.\n\nCarroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d at 174 (Judge Learned Hand’s formula).                     Other\n\njurisdictions have generally cited favorably the works of Dean Wade, which articulated\n\nfactors relevant to the manufacturer’s risk-utility calculus implicated in manufacturing or\n\ndesigning a product. See, e.g., Calles v. Scripto-Tokai Corp., 864 N.E.2d 249, 260-61\n\n(Ill. 2007) (citing cases from multiple jurisdictions). The factors are:\n\n              (1) The usefulness and desirability of the product—its utility\n              to the user and to the public as a whole.\n              (2) The safety aspects of the product—the likelihood that it\n              will cause injury, and the probable seriousness of the injury.\n              (3) The availability of a substitute product which would meet\n              the same need and not be as unsafe.\n              (4) The manufacturer’s ability to eliminate the unsafe\n              character of the product without impairing its usefulness or\n              making it too expensive to maintain its utility.\n              (5) The user’s ability to avoid danger by the exercise of care\n              in the use of the product.\n              (6) The user’s anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent\n              in the product and their availability, because of general\n              public knowledge of the obvious condition of the product, or\n              of the existence of suitable warnings or instructions.\n              (7) The feasibility, on the part of the manufacturer, of\n              spreading the loss by setting the price of the product or\n              carrying liability insurance.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 99\n\fId. (quoting Wade, 44 Miss. L. J. at 837–38). But, while these considerations may\n\nprovide a holistic perspective on a manufacturer’s choice to bring a product to market,\n\nthey may not be immediately responsive in the (typical) case implicating allegations\n\nrelating to a particular design feature. See Owen, HORNBOOK, at 315 (“[T]he issue\n\nproperly litigated almost always concerns the narrow “micro-balance” of pros and cons\n\nof a manufacturer’s failure to adopt some particular design feature that would have\n\nprevented the plaintiff’s harm. . . .”); but see Beard, 41 A.3d at 838 (trial courts not\n\nrestricted to considering single use of multi-use product in design defect, threshold, risk-\n\nutility balancing). The difficulty in presenting the issue to the jury, Professor Owen\n\nsuggests, is resolved by reference to Judge Learned Hand’s formula, which “succinctly\n\ncaptures the common sense idea that products are unacceptably dangerous if they\n\ncontain dangers that might cost-effectively (and practicably) be removed.”             Owen,\n\nHORNBOOK, at 315 (applying Hand formula in strict liability means that jury will decide\n\nwhether seller “fails to adopt a burden of precaution of less magnitude than the harm it\n\nis likely to prevent”).\n\n       Application of a risk-utility balancing test in its purest form likewise has theoretical\n\nand practical shortcomings. The goal and strength of a pure risk-utility test is to achieve\n\nefficiency or “to maximize the common good”; yet, this is also its perceived weakness.\n\nSee Owen, HORNBOOK, at 316. For, while efficiency is certainly a salutary goal of the\n\nlaw, it is not its only purpose and, in some respects, it conflicts with bedrock moral\n\nintuitions regarding justice in determining proper compensation for injury to persons or\n\nproperty in individual cases. Compare id. at 318 (“manufacturer applying cost-benefit\n\nanalysis to safety decision-making in good faith thereby necessarily respects the\n\nequality and safety rights of consumers as a group”) with William E. Nelson, THE MORAL\n\nPERVERSITY    OF THE   HAND CALCULUS, 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 759, 761 (2001) (describing\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 100\n\flimitations of risk-utility analysis in negligence context; “[U]ltimately the Hand calculus is\n\nnot about social efficiency, love, friendship or moral arrogance.           It is only about\n\ncompensation. The Hand calculus does not tell an entrepreneur whether or not to\n\nengage in conduct that will hurt one person and help another. . . . The Hand calculus\n\nserves a much narrower function. It tells an entrepreneur only that, if she engages in\n\nconduct that causes others to lose more than she gains, she will have to compensate\n\nthem for their losses, but that, if she gains more than they lose, no duty of\n\ncompensation will arise. . . . It is this very narrowness of the Hand calculus that makes\n\nit so morally perverse. . . . ”).      We should be mindful that public policy adjusts\n\nexpectations of efficiency and intuitions of justice considerations, informing a seller’s\n\nconduct toward consumers as a group, and ensuring proper compensation in individual\n\ncases by judicial application of the strict liability cause of action.\n\n       Of course, several other causes of action in tort incorporate a risk-utility hindsight\n\nanalysis: for example, negligence and strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities\n\n(i.e., the use of product in manner and context where danger is substantial,\n\nunavoidable, and dissonant among neighboring uses, see Owen, HORNBOOK, at 328).\n\nNeither of those actions involves a pure application of the risk-utility calculus. Accord\n\nNelson, 45 St. Louis U. L. J. at 767 (“In sum, it might be right to understand the Hand\n\ncalculus as a device for articulating our moral intuitions rather than a device for\n\nsuperceding them.”); accord Blue, 828 N.E.2d at 1140-41 (hindsight analysis inherent in\n\nrisk-utility test has earmarks of determining negligence). Nor are these causes of action\n\nthe same, albeit when they define the scope of compensation, they use similar rhetoric\n\nimplicating danger / risk and reasonableness. See generally, supra, n.18 (explaining\n\nCronin). The distinction draws upon the public policy that each cause of action\n\nvindicates, which incorporates moral intuitions drawn from communal social experience\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 101\n\ffor the purposes of modifying (most often attenuating) the effect of a risk-utility\n\napplication to ascertain appropriate compensation. Ultimately, distinct duties (whether\n\nstatutory or common law) and related causes of action develop to reflect determinations\n\nregarding a desirable allocation of risk. Cf. Kernan v. Am. Dredging Co., 355 U.S. 426,\n\n438 (1958) (Federal Employers’ Liability Act aimed at “adjusting equitably between the\n\nworker and his corporate employer the risks inherent in the railroad industry . . . plainly\n\nrejected many of the refined distinctions necessary in common-law tort doctrine for the\n\npurpose of allocating risks between persons who are more nearly on an equal footing as\n\nto financial capacity and ability to avoid the hazards involved.”).\n\n\n\n                                     Combined Tests\n\n       A number of jurisdictions have expressly or implicitly combined the consumer\n\nexpectations and risk-utility standards. One approach is to state the two standards in\n\nthe alternative; a plaintiff’s injury is compensable whether either test is met. See, e.g.,\n\nBarker, 573 P.2d at 457-58 (discussed infra); Calles, 864 N.E.2d at 257; Welch, 481\n\nF.2d at 254 (“A product is defective and unreasonably dangerous when a reasonable\n\nseller would not sell the product if he knew of the risks involved or if the risks are greater\n\nthan a reasonable buyer would expect.”).          The combined standard, which states\n\nconsumer expectations and risk-utility tests in the alternative, retains the features of\n\neach test, in practice, offering the parties a composite of the most workable features of\n\nboth tests. See Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Beck, 593 P.2d 871, 884-85 (Alaska 1979)\n\nsuperseded in part by Alaska Stat. § 09.17.060 (1986); accord Soule, supra.\n\n       A second approach is to incorporate the risk calculus into a test of consumer\n\nexpectations or, vice versa, to incorporate consumer expectations into the risk-utility\n\ndetermination.    See, e.g., Vautour, 784 A.2d at 1182 (internal citations omitted)\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 102\n\f(“[P]roduct ‘must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated\n\nby the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the\n\ncommunity as to its characteristics.’ . . .

In\n\nCalifornia, for example, the Barker court allocated to the supplier the burden to prove\n\nthe adequacy of a product’s design under the “risk-benefit” standard (i.e., to disprove a\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case that a product is defective). The Court reasoned that most of\n\nthe evidentiary matters which may be relevant in a typical case involve technical issues\n\npeculiarly within the knowledge of the manufacturer. 573 P.2d at 455. Commentators\n\nhave suggested that another California case, see Soule, supra, offered yet another\n\nvariation by which the applicability of either prong of the combined Barker test depends\n\nupon the complexity of the product. See Owen, HORNBOOK, at 325; Henderson, 83\n\nCornell L. Rev. at 899 (Soule “found the test unsuitable for cases involving product\n\ndesigns of any complexity. The court in Soule held that it would thereafter countenance\n\nuse of a limited consumer expectations test in cases ‘in which the everyday experience\n\nof the product’s users permits a conclusion that the product’s design violated minimum\n\nsafety assumptions.’”) (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 103\n\f       It is questionable, however, that the Soule court sought to foreclose strict liability\n\nclaims premised upon a simple / complex classification, as the commentators have\n\nsuggested. Such a standard begs -- or shifts -- the question of which designs are\n\ncomplex enough for application of the preferred test. Moreover, the implication that a\n\ndistinct class of “simple” products is subject to a consumer expectations standard of\n\nliability which is relatively unsuccessful at producing fair results is contradicted by\n\nSoule’s continued adherence to that standard. See Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at\n\n879-82 (disappointment of consumer expectations is inappropriate standard for\n\ndefectiveness in classic design cases).       Ourselves having had the experience of\n\nattempting to bring various principles to bear upon a single complex case, we believe\n\nthat, placed into its proper context, Soule may be read as simply commenting upon the\n\ncourt’s experience with analogous matters and offering guidance to aid trial courts in\n\nproperly guiding the parties and the jury through the litigation process:\n\n                     As we have seen, the consumer expectations test is\n              reserved for cases in which the everyday experience of the\n              product’s users permits a conclusion that the product’s\n              design violated minimum safety assumptions, and is thus\n              defective regardless of expert opinion about the merits of the\n              design. It follows that where the minimum safety of a product\n              is within the common knowledge of lay jurors, expert\n              witnesses may not be used to demonstrate what an ordinary\n              consumer would or should expect. Use of expert testimony\n              for that purpose would invade the jury’s function (see Evid.\n              Code, § 801, subd. (a)), and would invite circumvention of\n              the rule that the risks and benefits of a challenged design\n              must be carefully balanced whenever the issue of design\n              defect goes beyond the common experience of the product's\n              users.\n\n                     By the same token, the jury may not be left free to find\n              a violation of ordinary consumer expectations whenever it\n              chooses. Unless the facts actually permit an inference that\n              the product’s performance did not meet the minimum safety\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 104\n\f               expectations of its ordinary users, the jury must engage in\n               the balancing of risks and benefits required by the second\n               prong of Barker.\n882 P.2d at 308-09 (emphasis and footnote omitted). The Soule court concluded that,\n\nin light of precedent, the evidence offered by the plaintiff was not probative of the issue\n\nplaced in dispute (there, ordinary consumer expectations regarding excessive\n\nweakness or porosity in a bracket weld); but, the evidence offered raised an inference of\n\ndefect under the risk-benefit analysis and, therefore, the trial court should have properly\n\nlimited its instructions to the jury to that test. The all-too-common difficulty with the\n\ncommentators’ interpretation of Soule is that the court’s fact-bound evidentiary holding\n\nis taken out of its context, mistaken for establishment of a distinct burden of proof, and\n\ntreated as doctrine. Compare Scampone, 57 A.3d at 606; Gilbert, 327 A.2d at 96-97.\n\n       The Third Restatement also offers a variation upon those tests primarily based\n\nupon a risk-utility determination by requiring proof of a reasonable alternative design.\n\nSee Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 884-87 (explaining standard of proof premised\n\nupon risk-utility balancing and proof of alternative design).       The Third Restatement\n\nstates, in illustrative part:\n\n                       § 1 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for\n               Harm Caused by Defective Products\n                       One engaged in the business of selling or otherwise\n               distributing products who sells or distributes a defective\n               product is subject to liability for harm to persons or property\n               caused by the defect.\n\n\n                       § 2 Categories of Product Defect\n                       A product is defective when, at the time of sale or\n               distribution, it contains a manufacturing defect, is defective in\n               design, or is defective because of inadequate instructions or\n               warnings. A product:\n                       (a) contains a manufacturing defect when the product\n               departs from its intended design even though all possible\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 105\n\f             care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the\n             product;\n                    (b) is defective in design when the foreseeable risks\n             of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or\n             avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design\n             by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the\n             commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the\n             alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe;\n                    (c) is defective because of inadequate instructions or\n             warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the\n             product could have been reduced or avoided by the\n             provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller\n             or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain\n             of distribution, and the omission of the instructions or\n             warnings renders the product not reasonably safe.\n\n\n                     § 3 Circumstantial Evidence Supporting Inference of\n             Product Defect\n                     It may be inferred that the harm sustained by the\n             plaintiff was caused by a product defect existing at the time\n             of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific defect,\n             when the incident that harmed the plaintiff:\n                     (a) was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of\n             product defect; and\n                     (b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of\n             causes other than product defect existing at the time of sale\n             or distribution.\n\n                           *      *       *      *\n\n\nRESTATEMENT (3D)     OF   TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY §§ 1-3 (1998) (Liability Rules\n\nApplicable to Products Generally).\n\n      Section 1 of the Third Restatement articulates the general policy of strict liability.\n\nSections 2 through 4, as well as Sections 6 and 7, address evidentiary questions.\n\nNotably, Section 2 identifies three types of defects and, at least with respect to “design”\n\ndefect (subsection (b)), states a general rule, which defines a defect by reference to the\n\nrelative risk-utility calculi for the allegedly defective product and an alternatively\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 106\n\fdesigned product.     See also Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 888-89 (alternative\n\ndesign is proof of technological feasibility, “an empirical factor for courts to consider in\n\nthe normative process of risk-utility balancing”). Application of this general rule is, as a\n\nresult, limited -- and compensation is available -- only for those products for which an\n\nalternative design can be shown to exist. The Restatement illustrates its view that other\n\nevidence may be probative in a design defect case by articulating special rules. Thus,\n\nSections 3, 4, and comment e to Section 2 of the Third Restatement establish\n\nalternative means for proving a design defect “in circumstances in which common\n\nexperience teaches that an inference of defect may be warranted under the specific\n\nfacts,” where the seller or distributor violates statutory and regulatory norms, and “when\n\nthe product design is manifestly unreasonable.” Meanwhile, Sections 6 and 7 address\n\nspecial rules of liability for specific products: prescription drugs and medical devices,\n\nand food products. See id. at §§ 6-7; see also § 6 cmt. f (Section 6 principle articulates\n\njudgment that liability attaches only when certain type and quantum of evidence is\n\nadduced by plaintiff; noting expectation that, under “this very demanding objective\n\nstandard, liability is likely to be imposed only under unusual circumstances”). In relation\n\nto prescription drugs, for example, the special rule reflects in part an understanding that,\n\nfor some products, there is no alternative design.\n\n\n\n          4.      The Appropriate Post-Azzarello Strict Liability Construct\n\n                     a.     The “Move” to the Third Restatement\n\n       Guided by this decisional and doctrinal universe, we address the parties’\n\ncompeting arguments, which rely, to a great extent, upon jurisprudential and policy\n\nassertions. Initially, from a jurisprudential perspective, Omega Flex argues that the\n\nThird Restatement offers a clearer and more precise articulation of strict liability doctrine\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 107\n\fthan does the Second Restatement, and adoption of the new formulation would return\n\nPennsylvania into the mainstream in this arena. Omega Flex adds that a move to the\n\nThird Restatement is also the next logical step in the evolution of the law given that\n\nseveral Justices of this Court and members of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third\n\nCircuit, in Berrier, have articulated its merits and supported its application.        The\n\nTinchers respond that the Court has yet to “adopt” the Third Restatement and non-\n\nprecedential opinions are not a basis upon which to do so. Of course, non-precedential\n\nexpressions from this Court do not bind us to a course of action, nor do precedential\n\nexpressions of non-binding courts -- what matters is the persuasiveness of the\n\nreasoning and the current decisional context. In particular, the separate expressions of\n\nJustice Saylor have proven invaluable in crystallizing awareness of the difficulties in this\n\narea of law.\n\n       Omega Flex also argues that the Third Restatement is the better articulation of\n\nthe law, one specifically intended to address design defects and representing the\n\nmainstream view on the topic.       According to Omega Flex, the present iteration of\n\nPennsylvania law improperly lowers the burden of proof upon plaintiffs generally.\n\nOmega Flex posits that the Third Restatement, in contrast, is a “closely reasoned and\n\nbalanced approach” that enhances the fairness and efficacy of the liability scheme.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 48 (citing Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1021 (Saylor, J., concurring); Bugosh,\n\n971 A.2d at 1231 (Saylor, J., dissenting); General Services, 898 A.2d at 616 (Newman,\n\nJ., concurring and dissenting)). According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement is\n\nalready widely accepted and, as illustrated by this case, does not place an overly\n\nonerous burden of proof upon plaintiffs.      Finally, Omega Flex claims that the Third\n\nRestatement is not a departure from but a refinement of the Second Restatement,\n\nwhich “simply elevates the availability of a safer alternative design from a factor to be\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 108\n\fconsidered in the risk-utility analysis to a requisite element of a cause of action for\n\ndefective design.” Appellant’s Reply Brief at 17, 21. According to Omega Flex, the\n\nSecond Restatement did not specifically articulate the alternative design requirement\n\nbecause that Restatement “was focused on manufacturing, not design, defects.” Id. at\n\n20.\n\n       The Tinchers respond that the Third Restatement replaces the Second\n\nRestatement liability scheme with a negligence standard, which heightens the plaintiff’s\n\nburden of proof and, as a result, “compromises the deeply-rooted social policy of\n\nprotecting citizens through the imposition of strict liability under [the Second]\n\nRestatement.”     Appellees’ Brief at 23.     The Tinchers do not share Omega Flex’s\n\n“refinement” view of the Third Restatement, but instead describe the iteration as a\n\n“radical departure from established precedent [that] is not prudent or necessary.” Id. at\n\n26. The Tinchers also assert that the Third Restatement has limited support in other\n\njurisdictions. Moreover, the Tinchers claim that the Third Restatement standard will\n\nresult in a denial of compensation for meritorious claims by raising the cost of pursuing\n\nthe claims: “[t]he plaintiff will have to become an expert in the technology that caused\n\nthe plaintiff’s injury, and will need to re-design the product himself.” Id. at 34.\n\n       In essential part, both parties ask this Court to engage questions of whether their\n\npreferred iteration of the Restatement embodies a good, better, or more desirable public\n\npolicy. As we have explained, as an adjudicative body, this Court is not particularly\n\nwell-suited to such a broad task.         The appropriate question is which, if either,\n\nRestatement articulates the standard of proof in terms that effectuate the public policy of\n\nthis Commonwealth.\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we conclude that “adoption” of the Third Restatement\n\napproach is problematic. For one thing, articulating the burden of proof in terms of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 109\n\fevidence (alternative design) deemed probative of the general principle of strict liability\n\nproscriptively limits the applicability of the cause of action to certain products as to\n\nwhich that sort of evidence is available. The approach suggests a priori categorical\n\nexemptions for some products -- such as novel products with no alternative design --\n\nbut not others. The Connecticut Supreme Court suggested a similar insight: “in some\n\ninstances, a product may be in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the\n\nuser even though no feasible alternative design is available.” Potter, 694 A.2d at 1332.\n\n      Of course, the courts, legislatures, and the American Law Institute cannot\n\nforesee all the myriad products and circumstances that may arise.          The alternative\n\nmeans of proving liability in special cases recognized in the Third Restatement are\n\ndesigned to alleviate some of the harsh results of the general rule which are currently\n\nforeseeable, suggesting some limited liability in circumstances in which the special rules\n\nof Sections 2 -- comment e, 3, 4, 6, or 7 apply. Nevertheless, a question remains\n\nwhether the general and special rules taken together state a general principle of liability\n\nconsistent with the public policy that compensation is available for an injury caused by\n\nany type of defective product.     Compare Scampone, 57 A.3d at 606 (rejecting as\n\ninconsistent with negligence public policy nursing home’s argument that nursing home\n\nlacked duty of care to patients because prior decisional law had addressed only\n\nnegligence liability of hospitals and plaintiff had not adduced proof that nursing home\n\noffered same healthcare services as hospital).          In either case, this jurisdiction’s\n\nexperience with the repercussions of attempting to articulate specific principles of\n\nliability of broad application in implementing the strict liability cause of action make us\n\nreticent to go far beyond the necessities of an individual case and embrace a broad new\n\napproach premised upon what may prove to be procrustean categorical restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 110\n\f       Our reticence respecting the Third Restatement scheme is not a judgment on our\n\npart that, as a matter of policy, articulating categorical exemptions from strict liability is\n\nnot a viable or desirable alternative. Courts, which address evidence and arguments in\n\nindividual cases, are neither positioned, nor resourced, to make the kind of policy\n\njudgments required to arrive at an a priori decision as to which individual products, or\n\ncategories and types of products, should be exempt. Neither courts, nor the American\n\nLaw Institute for that matter, are in the business of articulating general principles tailored\n\nto anoint special “winners” and “losers” among those who engage in the same type of\n\nconduct. In our view, the question of “special tort-insulated status” for certain suppliers -\n\n- for example, manufacturers of innovative products with no comparable alternative\n\ndesign -- optimally “requires an assessment and balancing of policies best left to the\n\nGeneral Assembly.” Scampone, 57 A.3d at 599; Ayala, supra; but see, e.g., Hahn, 673\n\nA.2d 888 (where adequacy of warnings associated with prescription drugs is at issue,\n\nstrict liability is not recognized as basis for liability). As we explained in Scampone:\n\n                     Immunity or exemption from liability is the exception\n              to the general rule that an entity must meet the obligations it\n              incurs in functioning. . . . [A]ny other cause of action at\n              common law. . . evolves through either directly applicable\n              decisional law or by analogy, meaning that a defendant is\n              not categorically exempt from liability simply because\n              appellate decisional law has not specifically addressed a\n              theory of liability in a particular context.         Categorical\n              exemptions from liability exist (following the dismantling by\n              this Court of judicial immunities in the 1960s and 1970s) only\n              where the General Assembly has acted to create explicit\n              policy-based immunities, e.g., to protect the public purse.\n              Where either no immunity exists, or the legislative branch\n              created exceptions to an immunity legislatively conferred,\n              the default general rule of possible liability operates.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 111\n\fScampone, 57 A.3d at 599 (also explaining, inter alia, that from judicial perspective,\n\nduty at law is independent of financial status of individual defendants or of particular\n\nindustries).\n\n       The methodology employed by the reporters suggests additional potential\n\nweaknesses in the strict liability schemata of the Third Restatement that should caution\n\ncourts against categorical pronouncements. Citing representative cases from several\n\njurisdictions, the reporters offer that an alternative-design driven risk-utility general rule -\n\n- with a special consumer expectations rule for cases in which the design defect is\n\ndemonstrable -- reflects the consensus among American jurisdictions as to the\n\napplicable liability construct in “classic design cases.” See Henderson, 83 Cornell L.\n\nRev. at 887-901.      Notably, while recognizing that “tort cases are particularly fact-\n\nsensitive,” the reporters purported to undertake an “empirical study of case law” to\n\ndetermine whether the alternative-design driven risk-utility general rule has support in\n\nthe decisional law in a majority of jurisdictions. The reporters commented that: “[t]ort\n\ncases are particularly fact-sensitive and courts are consequently prone to pepper their\n\ndecisions with dicta and footnotes to allow ‘wiggle room’ for cases that may arise in the\n\nfuture. In contrast to legal treatise writers and restaters who, in synthesizing the law,\n\ntend to speak precisely and categorically, courts in their published opinions are more\n\nlikely to be open-textured and indecisive.” Id. at 888. This approach no doubt fulfills the\n\nrole of the American Law Institute in its own salutary task of restating and clarifying a\n\nview of strict liability that can be reduced to decisive terms. We also respect the effort\n\nof the Third Restatement reporters in approaching that non-judicial task practically and\n\nwith humility.    But, what drives the Institute and treatise writers does not make\n\ncomparative modesty, nuance, and reticence in the judiciary mistaken (much less\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 112\n\findecisive) in a jurisdiction, like Pennsylvania, where the area, to date, has been the\n\nexclusive province of the common law.\n\n       That evidence of the existence and specifications of an alternative design is\n\nrelevant and even highly probative to prove disputed issues in a products liability case,\n\nsuch as technological feasibility, cost, etc., is certainly true. That the more typical case\n\nimplicates the type of products and circumstances in which evidence of an alternative\n\nproduct design is the most persuasive and efficient means of convincing the trier of fact\n\nmay also be true. That offering evidence of an alternative product design may be the\n\npreferred legal strategy of the plaintiff’s bar in certain cases -- or may be a strategy the\n\ndefense bar would like to impose on the plaintiff’s bar in certain cases -- again may also\n\nbe true. But, while the reporters’ intuition that meritorious cases are premised upon\n\ncertain types of evidence may have some general validity and support in practice (and\n\nmay prove helpful to litigants in articulating claims and preparing defenses), the\n\nreporters’ commentary candidly betrays a problem -- for the judiciary at least -- of\n\nperspective. Principally, at least in a climate where suggestions are made along the\n\nlines of simply “adopting” or “moving to” a Restatement construct, it is our view that the\n\nreporters’ “precise and categorical” perspective insufficiently accounts for the\n\nimperatives of the courts’ more modest decisional role, by, for example, describing the\n\nreasoned and purposeful articulation of general principles as “dicta.”\n\n       As a jurisprudential matter, articulating common law principles in terms of\n\nextrapolations from evidence relevant in the typical case is problematic for good\n\nreasons. It is worth reiterating that:\n\n                    [T]his Court’s decisions are read against the facts\n              because “our decisional law generally develops\n              incrementally, within the confines of the circumstances of\n              cases as they come before the Court. For one thing, it is\n              very difficult for courts to determine the range of factual\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 113\n\f              circumstances to which a particular rule should apply in light\n              of the often myriad possibilities.” [Maloney, 984 A.2d at 489-\n              90.] Depending on the perspective of the Court, prospective\n              or retrospective, this insight has separate but related\n              implications.     Prospectively, we endeavor to render\n              determinations that “spring [ ] from the facts before us in\n              th[e] appeal, while recognizing that our task is not simply to\n              decide this case, but also to provide guidance upon the\n              broader legal issue,” especially where the issue is one of first\n              impression. “By necessity, this undertaking requires breadth\n              of vision and consideration of both sides of the coin: the\n              facts of a given case on one side, and the law, which will\n              almost always be more conceptual, on the other.”\n              [Thierfelder v. Wolfert, 52 A.3d 1251, 1264 n.9 (Pa. 2012)].\n              On the other hand, recognizing the necessary narrowness of\n              the individual decisional task and the limitations of imperfect\n              foresight, we aspire to embrace precision and avoid “the\n              possibility that words or phrases or sentences may be taken\n              out of context and treated as doctrines.” Maloney, 984 A.2d\n              at 490 (quoting Northwestern Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Maggio, 976\n              F.2d 320, 323 (7th Cir. 1992)).\n\n\nScampone, 57 A.3d at 604-05. Particularly relevant here, we added: “In considering\n\ndecisions retrospectively, when called upon to apply them, the law does not lose its\n\nprecedential mantle based simply on formulaic reading; the intent of the principle that\n\ndecisions are to be read against their facts is simply to prevent ‘wooden application of\n\nabstract principles to circumstances in which different considerations may pertain.’” Id.\n\nat 605 (quoting Maloney, 984 A.2d at 485-86). As a practical matter, courts articulate\n\ngeneral principles -- what the Restatement reporters may in some instances call “dicta” -\n\n- before applying them to the facts in order to place a set a facts in perspective, to\n\nexplain and ground the disposition.      This is because, at its best, decisional law is\n\nprinciple-driven and not result-driven (although just results are certainly the overarching\n\ngoal).   And, a reasoned decision will always permit easy or intuitive drafting and\n\nexplication of the relevant principles. Candid decision-making articulates governing,\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 114\n\fand occasionally competing principles, and has the flexibility to reassess a prior\n\nprinciple upon confrontation with nuance, better or different advocacy, or articulation of\n\na previously unperceived principle of salutary value.\n\n       Insight into the reporters’ perspective on how the nature of decisions at common\n\nlaw informs their consensus effort to speak otherwise, i.e., to “speak precisely and\n\ncategorically” by classifying defect claims (i.e., classic design cases, prescription drugs\n\ncases, etc.) and inserting evidentiary prerequisites into general and special rules\n\napplicable to the distinct categories to which they pertain, should serve as a reminder of\n\ncomparative judicial modesty. The Third Restatement approach presumes too much\n\ncertainty about the range of circumstances, factual or otherwise, to which the “general\n\nrule” articulated should apply.\n\n       Indeed, relying upon a confined universe of reported appellate cases to draw\n\nevidence-based (versus principle-based) rules is problematic as a general matter in our\n\nmature legal system. This is so because the small class of cases posing issues of\n\nsufficient consequence to result in reported, precedential decisions naturally tends to\n\nraise narrow unsettled issues and / or fact-sensitive applications, rather than to provide\n\nvehicles to illustrate those parts of the law that are so “well accepted” as to reflect\n\nemergent general rules.      Of course, these cases may, by analogy and distinction,\n\nilluminate general principles at issue; but, purporting to limit the general rule to the facts\n\nof those cases is anathema to the common law. Stated otherwise, simply because in\n\ncases of factually-marginal applications courts have found evidence relating to\n\nalternative designs to be particularly probative and persuasive, in our minds, does not\n\nnecessarily support a thesis that adducing such evidence is dispositive of whether a\n\nplaintiff has carried his / her burden of proof. See, e.g., Soule, 882 P.2d at 308. The\n\nprincipal point is that a jurisdiction is free to adopt a policy that reduces a supplier’s\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 115\n\fexposure to strict liability for a product. But, it would either be naïve or inaccurate to\n\ndeclare that existing decisional law in Pennsylvania expressly articulates, or\n\ncontemplates, only the general principle in the terms of the Third Restatement. And, if\n\nadopted as a broadly applicable legal regime, the Third Restatement would engender a\n\nself-fulfilling prophecy by providing for a future restatement, going forward, of only those\n\ncases that meet the evidentiary threshold the regime permits.\n\n       Additionally, the Third Restatement construct, because unmoored from guidance\n\nupon the broader legal issue, would likely impede the principled development of the law\n\nin this arena.   Although “[b]right lines and broad rules always offer a superficially\n\nenticing option,” they also risk elevating the lull of simplicity to doctrine. See, e.g.,\n\nScampone, 57 A.3d at 598; Azzarello.          And, finally, our reticence respecting broad\n\napproval of the Third Restatement is separately explainable by looking no further than\n\nto the aftermath of Azzarello, whose negligence rhetoric-related doctrinal proscription\n\narising from a peculiar set of circumstances had long-term deleterious effects on the\n\ndevelopment of strict liability law in Pennsylvania. Azzarello and Scampone illustrate, in\n\ndifferent ways, how dogmatic pronouncements are difficult to apply in individual cases\n\nwithout guidance upon the broader legal issue and the result is often that litigation will\n\nderail into irrelevant, unreasoned, or unprincipled factual disputes (an issue to which we\n\nalso adverted in our discussion of Soule, supra). As a Court, in this dynamic area, we\n\nmust settle for the incremental approach.24\n\n24\n       Commentary by Dean Wade and Dean W. Page Keeton of the University of\nTexas offered related approaches to the standard of proof in design defect cases\npremised upon imputation of knowledge of risks when such knowledge was unavailable\nprior to marketing. Although offering invaluable insight, an imputation of knowledge\napproach has not gained substantial traction because of difficulties identified by the\nauthors themselves. See generally John W. Wade, THE PASSAGE OF TIME: THE\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY: ON THE EFFECT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE\nUNAVAILABLE PRIOR TO MARKETING, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 734 (1983).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 116\n\f       Our previous analysis illustrates that the Third Restatement does not offer an\n\narticulation of the law sufficient to persuade us to simply abandon the Second\n\nRestatement formulation of the strict products liability cause of action and “move” to the\n\nThird Restatement.       Unlike the Third Restatement, we believe that the Second\n\nRestatement already adopted, and properly calibrated, permits the plaintiffs to tailor\n\ntheir factual allegations and legal argumentation to the circumstances as they present\n\nthemselves in the real-world crucible of litigation, rather than relying upon an evidence-\n\nbound standard of proof.\n\n\n\n                           b.     Prevailing Standard of Proof\n\n       Having overruled Azzarello and declined the invitation to fill the void by simply\n\n“adopting” the Third Restatement formulation, we proceed to address the appropriate\n\nstandard of proof of a strict liability claim in Pennsylvania.\n\n       Initially, we note that, although Pennsylvania remains a Second Restatement\n\njurisdiction, “adoption” of its principles into our common law is distinct in concept and\n\napplication from the adoption of a statute by the General Assembly.             Although the\n\nreporter’s words have intrinsic significance because their purpose is to explain the legal\n\nprinciple clearly, they are not entitled to the fidelity due a legislative body’s expression of\n\npolicy, whose judgment and intent, wise or unwise, a court generally is obligated to\n\neffectuate, absent constitutional infirmity. The language of a restatement, as a result, is\n\nnot necessarily susceptible to “statutory”-type construction or parsing. An effective and\n\nvaluable restatement of the law offers instead a pithy articulation of a principle of law\n\nwhich, in many cases, including novel or difficult ones, represents a starting template for\n\nmembers of the judiciary, whose duty is then to employ an educated, candid, and\n\ncommon-sense approach to ensure dispensation of justice to the citizenry.                 The\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 117\n\fcommon law relies in individual cases upon clear iterations of the facts and skillful\n\nadvocacy, and evolves in principle by analogy, distinction, and reasoned explication.\n\nAccord Scampone, 57 A.3d at 605. This is the essence of justice at common law.\n\n       With this qualification in mind, we explain: (1) that the strict liability cause of\n\naction sounds in tort; (2) that the notion of “defective condition unreasonably dangerous”\n\nis the normative principle of the strict liability cause of action, which reflects the standard\n\nof review or application of the tort, and its history; and (3) the appropriate interplay of\n\nprinciple and evidence.25\n\n       It is important to remember that the action sounds in tort, i.e. the cause involves\n\nbreach of duties “imposed by law as a matter of social policy,” rather than contract, i.e.,\n\nthe cause involves breach of duties “imposed by mutual consensus agreements\n\nbetween particular individuals.” Ash, 932 A.2d at 884; see RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS\n\n§ 402A(2). Nevertheless, the tortious conduct at issue is not the same as that found in\n\ntraditional claims of negligence and commonly associated with the more colloquial\n\nnotion of “fault.”   In this sense, introducing a colloquial notion of “fault” into the\n\nconversation relating to strict product liability in tort detracts from the precision required\n\nto keep this legal proposition within rational bounds.26\n\n25\n         While the Second Restatement formulation of the principles governing the strict\nliability cause of action in tort may have proven substantially less than clear, the policy\nthat formulation embodies has not been challenged here and has largely remained\nuncontroverted. Accord Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 868 (premised upon survey of\ndecisional law, noting rejection of “extreme positions that question the need to develop\na general standard for defective design,” such as absolute liability and no strict liability\n(“defer[ing] responsibility for design choices exclusively to the market”), as unnecessary\n“tilting at windmills”).\n\n26\n         But see Sherk, 450 A.2d at 621 (equating liability without proof of negligence,\ni.e., breach of duty of care, to liability without fault). Consider a counterexample of tort\nliability without fault and its reasoned justification. We have explained that:\n\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 118\n\f         As we explain, after reviewing the provenance of the cause of action, the Second\n\nRestatement reporter’s choice of words, and the evolution of the cause of action in\n\napplication, we hold that, in Pennsylvania, the cause of action in strict products liability\n\nrequires proof, in the alternative, either of the ordinary consumer’s expectations or of\n\nthe risk-utility of a product. To maintain the integrity and fairness of the strict products\n\nliability cause of action, each part of this standard of proof remains subject to its\n\ntheoretical limitations, as explained above.       We believe that the demands of strict\n\nliability policy are met because the composite standard retains the best functioning\n\nfeatures of each test, when applied in the appropriate factual context.

City of Philadelphia, 613 A.2d 1178, 1181 (Pa.\n               1992). “Vicarious liability, sometimes referred to as imputed\n               negligence, means in its simplest form that, by reason of\n               some relation existing between A and B, the negligence of A\n               is to be charged against B although B has played no part in\n               it, has done nothing whatever to aid or encourage it, or\n               indeed has done all that he possibly can to prevent it.” Id.\n               (quoting Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 69, at 499 (5th ed.\n               1984)).

In other cases, however, the substantive or procedural\n\nconventions appurtenant to theories of negligence (e.g., requirement to join all potential\n\ntortfeasors) and breach of warranty (e.g., requirement of privity), deemed at the time\n\nnecessary to vindicate interests that underpinned the respective theories, failed to\n\ngenerate fair, coherent results and doctrine, in the face of evolving or newly-revealed\n\ncircumstances (i.e., an increasingly vibrant market for products) and an evolving interest\n\nin protecting consumers.     See, e.g., Webb, 220 A.2d at 854 (trial court dismissed\n\nnegligence claim, reasoning that plaintiff had not joined all parties against whom\n\ninference of negligence could be drawn); Miller, 221 A.2d at 324 (trial court dismissed\n\nbreach of warranty claim, reasoning that infant-plaintiff was not in privity with\n\nmanufacturer, distributor, or retailer). Although courts subsequently abandoned some\n\nnarrow pleading and proof conventions (in the case of privity, for example) or justified\n\nresults on equitable bases in other cases, the doctrinal strain opened the possibility of a\n\nseparate tort that tailored itself to the articulated policy goals. See, e.g., Salvador, 319\n\nA.2d at 907 (discarded burden to prove horizontal privity); Henningsen v. Bloomfield\n\nMotors, Inc., 161 A.2d 69 (N.J. 1960) (disclaimer of implied warranty of merchantability\n\nby dealer and attempted elimination of all obligations other than replacement of\n\ndefective parts violate public policy and are void).27\n\n27\n       In 1960, Dean Prosser also explained the systemic efficiency benefits deriving\nfrom a single cause of action in strict liability. According to Dean Prosser:\n\n                    It [wa]s already possible to enforce strict liability by\n            resort to a series of actions, in which the retailer is first held\n            liable on a warranty to his purchaser, and indemnity on a\n            warranty is then sought successively from other suppliers,\n            until the manufacturer finally pays the damages, with the\n            added costs of repeated litigation. This is an expensive,\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 120\n\f       The emergent single cause of action in tort -- strict liability -- retained,\n\nnevertheless, those aspects of negligence and breach of warranty liability theories from\n\nwhich it evolved. Stated otherwise, the theory of strict liability as it evolved overlaps in\n\neffect with the theories of negligence and breach of warranty. (Parenthetically, this\n\nplaces into context Section 402A(2), which states that the rule of strict liability “applies\n\nalthough (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his\n\nproduct, and (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into\n\nany contractual relation with the seller.”). As we explained above, this is not an unusual\n\ndevelopment in the common law: for example, negligence and strict liability for\n\nabnormally dangerous activities also overlap in the sense that they both are premised\n\nupon a risk-utility hindsight analysis with different public policy overlays to modify their\n\napplication to distinct conduct. Relevant here, public policy also adjusts expectations of\n\nefficiency and intuitions of justice considerations in the context of products liability,\n\ninforming a seller’s conduct toward consumers as a group and ensuring compensation\n\nin individual cases by judicial application of the strict liability cause of action.\n\nEssentially, strict liability is a theory that effectuates a further shift of the risk of harm\n\nonto the supplier than either negligence or breach of warranty theory by combining the\n\nbalancing of interests inherent in those two causes of action.\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\n            time-consuming, and wasteful process, and it may be\n            interrupted by insolvency, lack of jurisdiction, disclaimers, or\n            the statute of limitations, anywhere along the line. What is\n            needed is a blanket rule which makes any supplier in the\n            chain liable directly to the ultimate user, and so short-circuits\n            the whole unwieldy process. This is in the interest, not only\n            of the consumer, but of the courts, and even on occasion of\n            the suppliers themselves.\n\n69 Yale L. J. at 1123-24 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 121\n\f       The core insight, which the Supreme Court of California pioneered in the 1978\n\nBarker decision, is that the standard of proof in a strict liability cause of action properly\n\nreflects this duality of purpose. The Barker Court thus articulated a standard of proof\n\nwhich stated the consumer expectations test and the risk-utility test in the alternative.\n\nThe alternative test standard of proof is a “composite” that retains “the most workable\n\nfeatures of each of the other tests.” Caterpillar, 593 P.2d at 884-85.\n\n       One other insight completes the picture: a duality in the strict liability cause of\n\naction is evident in the expectation that all sellers in the distributive chain are legally\n\nresponsible for the product in strict liability.    Dean Prosser explained the expected\n\nresults of applying strict liability:\n\n                      Where the action is against the manufacturer of the\n               product, an honest estimate might very well be that there is\n               not one case in a hundred in which strict liability would result\n               in recovery where negligence does not. . . . All this,\n               however, is but half of the picture. There are other sellers\n               than the manufacturer of the product. It will pass through the\n               hands of a whole line of other dealers, and the plaintiff may\n               have good reason to sue any or all of them. . . . It is here\n               that negligence liability breaks down. The wholesaler, the\n               jobber, and the retailer normally are simply not negligent.\n               They are under no duty to test or inspect the chattel, and\n               they do not do so; and when, as is usually the case today, it\n               comes to them in a sealed container, examination becomes\n               impossible without destroying marketability. No inference of\n               negligence can arise against these sellers, and res ipsa\n               loquitur is of no use at all.\nProsser, 69 Yale L. J. at 1116-17 (footnote omitted).\n\n       Thus, in placing a product on the market, a manufacturer acts to design (and\n\nmanufacture) the product and, along with other distributors, to sell the product, including\n\nmaking the product attractive for sale by making implicit representations of the product’s\n\nsafety. See Knitz v. Minster Mach. Co., 432 N.E.2d 814, 818 (Ohio 1982) (quoting\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 122\n\fGreenman v. Yuba Power Prods., 377 P.2d 897 (Cal. 1963)) (Second Restatement\n\nstandard “followed as a logical development from commercial warranty origins of strict\n\nliability in tort” and reflected “the commercial reality that ‘(i)mplicit in . . .

A manufacturer, in designing the\n\nproduct, engages in a risk-utility calculus; the policy-driven post hoc risk-utility calculus\n\nnecessary to determine whether the design choice thus made may justly require\n\ncompensation for injury explains the relevance of that standard of proof in strict liability.\n\nMeanwhile, a seller of the product -- whether the manufacturer or the supplier in the\n\nchain of distribution -- implicitly represents by placing a product on the market that the\n\nproduct is not in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous.             Accord Markle v.\n\nMulholland’s Inc., 509 P.2d 529, 532 (Or. 1973) (implied representation of merchantable\n\nquality accounts for Restatement formulation, whose “language is consistent only with\n\nsomething conceptually similar to an expectation by the consumer of merchantable\n\nquality.

This\n\nexpectation is given legal sanction by the law through an assumption that the seller, by\n\nso placing the article in the stream of commerce, has represented that the article is not\n\nunreasonably dangerous if put to its intended use.”).                  Express and implied\n\nrepresentations by the manufacturer and other suppliers in the distributive chain,\n\ncontextualized by common human experience to evolve the notion of fault in strict\n\nliability, explain the relevance of evidence regarding consumer expectations, both as an\n\nindependent source of liability (e.g., expectations created by advertising or warnings)\n\nand as part of the calculus of risk (e.g., expectations that drive product design choices).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 123\n\f       The dual analytical structure also explains the historical ebb and flow of\n\nconsumer expectations / risk-utility and warranty / negligence rhetoric that pervades\n\ndecisional law. Essentially, given that a term like “defective condition unreasonably\n\ndangerous” is not self-defining, courts have offered multiple definitions applicable in the\n\nseveral contexts in which a definitional issue has arisen, all effectuating the single policy\n\nthat those who sell a product are held responsible for damages caused to a consumer\n\nby the reasonable use of the product. See, e.g., Miller, 221 A.2d at 334-35 (Jones, J.,\n\nconcurring and dissenting); accord Barker, 573 P.2d at 453 (“term defect as utilized in\n\nthe strict liability context is neither self-defining nor susceptible to a single definition\n\napplicable in all contexts”). The exposition of strict liability in Pennsylvania and in other\n\njurisdictions illustrates that the original disputes implicated tensions over how warranty\n\nprinciples limited liability on a strict liability in tort theory. Decisional law that derived\n\nfrom the tension reflected a period of expanding liability (because plaintiffs were not\n\nrequired to prove privity as in a breach of warranty action, see, e.g., Miller). These\n\ntypes of disputes waned as the law settled in, both by way of decisional law discarding\n\nprivity in breach of warranty cases and by clarification of this part of the law in the late\n\n1960s and early 1970s, which may have aided suppliers to internalize the effects of\n\nwarranty-type strict liability into their conduct and to pass the attendant costs on to\n\nconsumers. In a sense, then, the consumer expectations gauge for strict liability has\n\nhad some apparent success in vindicating the policy of strict liability.\n\n       Modern decisional law reflects that the focus of disputes -- or at least those\n\ndisputes making their way into the appellate courts -- has increasingly been upon the\n\nnegligence-derived risk-utility alternative formulation of the standard. The prominence\n\nof the legal issue in decisional law coincides with the advent of design defect claims, in\n\nwhich issues of proof tend to more complexity than where a manufacturing defect is in\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 124\n\fdispute. This development reflected the complex litigation calculus implicated in a strict\n\nliability claim premised upon this type of defect resulting from either lack of proof (for\n\nexample in the case of known or foreseeable risks for which an available cure may or\n\nmay not have been available at the time of design) or the relative deterrent inefficacy of\n\na theory of liability for unknowable risks, short of exiting the market.

J. at 1116 (“So long as there is the possibility that negligence may not be found,\n\nthe defendant is encouraged by vain hopes, and the plaintiff gnawed by lingering\n\ndoubts; and a case which can be decided for the defendant is worth less, in terms of\n\nsettlement, than one which can not.       And so long as the defendant can introduce\n\nevidence of his own due care, the possibility remains that it may influence the size of\n\nthe verdict, as jurymen impressed with it stubbornly hold out for no liability, or a smaller\n\nsum.”) (emphasis omitted). Yet, some types of disputes are absent from the decisional\n\nlaw and may, indeed, provide rather strong evidence of strict liability as a deterrent by\n\npreventing bringing a product to market or encouraging settlement of claims -- it must\n\nbe remembered that an appellate expression is not necessary to illustrate the point that\n\ndesigners are properly deterred by strict liability from using consumers as guinea pigs.\n\nSee Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 901 (“Some courts, in dicta, hold out the\n\npossibility that the risk-utility imbalance might be so egregious that the product should\n\nnot be marketed at all.     Actual holdings to this effect, however, are non-existent.”)\n\n(footnote omitted).28\n\n28\n       Parenthetically, the number of manufacturing claims is significantly lower than\nthat of design defect claims. Dean Prosser explained: “It is true also that [the plaintiff]\nseldom, if ever, has any direct evidence of what went on in the defendant’s plant. But in\nevery jurisdiction, he is aided by the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, or by its practical\nequivalent.” Prosser, 69 Yale L. J. at 1114 (footnote omitted). In a design defect case,\nthe doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is generally of little help in light of the complexities of\nconduct involved.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 125\n\f       In either case, that the theory of strict liability -- like all other tort causes of action\n\n-- is not fully capable of providing a sufficient deterrent incentive to achieve perfect\n\nsafety goals is not a justification for jettisoning or restricting the duty in strict liability,\n\nwhose compensatory objective remains part of the public policy of this Commonwealth.\n\nSee Ash, 932 A.2d at 882 (purpose of torts law is to “put an injured person in a position\n\nas near as possible to his position prior to the tort”); accord Scampone, 57 A.3d at 596;\n\nExcavation Tech., Inc. v. Columbia Gas Co. of Pa., 985 A.2d 840, 844 (Pa. 2009)\n\n(“object of tort law is to modify behavior through allocation of financial risk on party best\n\npositioned to prevent harm”) (citation omitted); Trosky v.

Rev. 1801 (1997).\n\n       Finally, we remark upon evidentiary issues necessarily implicated by the\n\nstandard of proof we have articulated. Derived from its negligence-warranty dichotomy,\n\nthe strict liability cause of action theoretically permits compensation where harm results\n\nfrom risks that are known or foreseeable (although proof of either may be unavailable) --\n\na circumstance similar to cases in which traditional negligence theory is implicated --\n\nand also where harm results from risks unknowable at the time of manufacture or sale --\n\na circumstance similar to cases in which traditional implied warranty theory is\n\nimplicated. The difficulty is in cabining liability premised upon a risk unknowable at the\n\ntime of manufacture / sale, which was logically unavoidable, in circumstances in which\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 126\n\fliability and attendant compensation was potentially limitless (in other words, 100\n\npercent of risk would be shifted to suppliers). Imputing knowledge, and assessing the\n\navoidability of risk -- was theoretically counterintuitive and offered practical difficulties,\n\nas illustrated by the Wade-Keeton debate. See generally John W. Wade, THE PASSAGE\n\nOF TIME: THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY: ON THE EFFECT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY OF\n\nKNOWLEDGE UNAVAILABLE PRIOR        TO   MARKETING, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 734 (1983). Both\n\nrationing and policy -- as expressed in the qualification “unreasonably dangerous” --\n\nsupported limitations.    The risk-utility calculus has been suggested as a normative\n\nsolution to cabin liability exposure regardless of the type of claim asserted (i.e., of either\n\na known / foreseeable or an unknown risk). Accord Beard, 41 A.3d at 838 (meaningful\n\nrisk-utility evaluation is effort to implement rational limits on strict liability in tort).\n\nBecause the circumstance is not before us, and in light of the complexities and dearth of\n\npersuasive authority, we will await the appropriate case to speak definitively to this\n\nissue.\n\n         By comparison, the Tinchers’ claim was essentially premised upon the allegation\n\nthat the risk of harm related to TracPipe’s thickness was both foreseeable and\n\navoidable, as illustrated by the resistance to lightning of black iron pipe.           These\n\nallegations, at least, bear the indicia of negligence. Indeed, in some respects this is the\n\n“typical” case, which explains both the insight that in design cases, the character of the\n\nproduct and the conduct of the manufacturer are largely inseparable, and the Third\n\nRestatement’s approach of requiring an alternative design as part of the standard of\n\nproof. See, e.g., Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1013-14 (Saylor, J., concurring); Henderson, 83\n\nCornell L. Rev. at 876-87 (“Developing a General Defectiveness Standard for Classic\n\nDesign Cases”). Indeed, the Tinchers themselves sought summary relief and dismissal\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 127\n\fof this case premised upon the argument that the same result would have obtained\n\nunder either the Second or the Third Restatement iteration of the law.\n\n       But, the point that we have stressed repeatedly in this Opinion, is that courts do\n\nnot try the “typical” products case exclusively and a principle of the common law must\n\npermit just application to myriad factual circumstances that are beyond our power to\n\nconceive. Circumstances like product diversity, general uncertainties inherent in the\n\ncreative process, difficulties in recreating the design process, difficulties in the discovery\n\nprocess, to name just a few, may contribute to whether cases other than the typical\n\ncase will generate a dispute and resulting decisional precedent. Nevertheless, in many\n\ncircumstances, courts may be called upon to examine whether the rule has outrun the\n\nreason. Self-selection of cases (consumers and manufacturers internalizing the policy\n\nvindicated by the strict liability theory and modifying conduct as a result), variations in\n\nthe quality and nuance in competing argumentation from counsel, including in the\n\nfashioning of suggested jury charges applicable to a particular case, courts’ articulation\n\nof relevant normative principles as they pertain to specific factual scenarios, and\n\nscholarly commentary will likely contribute to the continually developing decisional law.\n\n       The delivery of justice in this area requires a recognition and appreciation of the\n\nappropriate and significant roles played by advocates, trial judges, and the appellate\n\njudiciary. Particularly relevant here, we note that the area of strict liability law remains\n\ncomplex and our decision here does not purport to foresee and account for the myriad\n\nimplications or potential pitfalls as yet unarticulated or unappreciated. Thus, at the trial\n\nlevel, and as with other legal concepts, “it is incumbent upon the parties, through their\n\nattorneys, to aid courts in narrowing issues and formulating appropriate instructions to\n\nguide juries in their factual determinations. . . .” It is worth reiterating that “[b]right lines\n\nand broad rules always offer a superficially enticing option.            However, we cannot\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 128\n\felevate the lull of simplicity over the balancing of interests embodied by the principles\n\nunderpinning [the jurisprudence of the relevant area of law].” Scampone, 57 A.3d at\n\n598. The principal point is that judicial modesty counsels that we be content to permit\n\nthe common law to develop incrementally, as we provide reasoned explications of\n\nprinciples pertinent to factual circumstances of the cases that come before the Court.\n\nSee Scampone, 57 A.3d at 605; Barker, 573 P.2d at 453 (difficulties inherent in giving\n\ncontent to defectiveness standard “could best be resolved by resort to the ‘cluster of\n\nuseful precedents’ which have been developed in the product liability field. . . .”).\n\n\n\n                   5.     Litigation Considerations Deriving from the\n\n                              New Strict Liability Construct\n\n                        a.     Judge and Jury; Jury Instructions\n\n        Having outlined these principles of strict liability law, we next offer the following\n\nguidance relating to the appropriate provinces of the judge and jury, and to adequate,\n\ntargeted jury instructions in a strict liability case. As noted, the Azzarello Court held\n\nthat, as a gauge for whether a product is unreasonably dangerous, the balancing of\n\nrisks and utilities, when implicated, was an issue of law dependent upon social policy to\n\nbe decided by the trial court. The jury would then simply resolve any “dispute as to the\n\ncondition of a product,” as a separate question.         391 A.2d at 1025-27.      We have\n\nexplained why we believe that severing findings relating to the risk-utility calculus from\n\nfindings related to the condition of the product is impracticable and inconsistent with the\n\ntheory of strict liability. We offer additional guidance to confirm our departure from that\n\naspect of Azzarello that assigned these roles to the judge and jury in a strict liability\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 129\n\f       As is generally the case, the plaintiff is the master of the claim in the first\n\ninstance. The immediate implication is that counsel must articulate the plaintiff’s strict\n\nliability claim by alleging sufficient facts to make a prima facie case premised upon\n\neither a “consumer expectations” or “risk-utility” theory, or both. The calculus for a\n\nplaintiff and a plaintiff’s advocate in choosing to pursue either theory or both will likely\n\naccount, among other things, for the nature of the product, for the theoretical limitations\n\nof either alternative standard of proof, for whether pursuing both theories simultaneously\n\nis likely to confuse the finder of fact and, most importantly, for the evidence available or\n\nlikely to become available for trial. As discovery and case preparation proceed, and the\n\nevidentiary record evolves, the plaintiff may choose to pursue or abandon either theory,\n\nor pursue both, if the evidence so warrants.        A defendant may also seek to have\n\ndismissed any overreaching by the plaintiff via appropriate motion and objection. The\n\ntrial court is to act in its ordinary gate-keeper role, e.g., monitoring litigation, mediating\n\nor adjudicating any subsidiary differences, and pending objections and motions,\n\nincluding those seeking to narrow, or expand, the theories of litigation to be pursued at\n\ntrial. See, e.g., Soule, 882 P.2d at 303, 309.29\n\n29\n        For example, in Soule, the trial court gave the standard two-prong Barker\ninstruction for design defect without modification, over the defendant-manufacturer’s\nobjection. The defendant argued that, given the nature of the product, instructing the\njury on the consumer expectations standard was error. On appeal, the Supreme Court\nof California agreed:\n\n                   [T]he jury may not be left free to find a violation of\n            ordinary consumer expectations whenever it chooses.\n            Unless the facts actually permit an inference that the\n            product’s performance did not meet the minimum safety\n            expectations of its ordinary users, the jury must engage in\n            the balancing of risks and benefits required by the second\n            prong of Barker.        Accordingly, as Barker indicated,\n            instructions are misleading and incorrect if they allow a jury\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 130\n\f       One crucial aspect of the trial court’s role is, of course, the task of defining the\n\nstrict liability legal universe within which a particular jury operates for purposes of\n\ndischarging its function. See Commonwealth v. Graham, 9 A.3d 196, 201-02 & n.9 (Pa.\n\n2010); see, e.g., Soule, supra. To reiterate, a jury charge is adequate “unless the\n\nissues are not made clear, the jury was misled by the instructions, or there was an\n\nomission from the charge amounting to a fundamental error.” Chambers, 980 A.2d at\n\n49-50; see also Price v. Guy, 735 A.2d 668, 670 (Pa. 1999).\n\n       In this case, in critical part, the trial court instructed the jury in accordance with\n\nthe law as articulated in Azzarello and its progeny. See N.T., 10/19/2010, at 794-98.\n\nWe have now overruled Azzarello and we have additionally explained foundational\n\nissues related to the strict liability cause of action in Pennsylvania -- the public policy\n\nwhich the cause of action vindicates, the duty recognized by the public policy, and the\n\nstandard and burden of proof necessary to prove breach that duty. Going forward,\n\nconsistent with this decision, when a plaintiff proceeds on a theory that implicates a risk-\n\nutility calculus, proof of risks and utilities are part of the burden to prove that the harm\n\nsuffered was due to the defective condition of the product. The credibility of witnesses\n\nand testimony offered, the weight of evidence relevant to the risk-utility calculus, and\n\nwhether a party has met the burden to prove the elements of the strict liability cause of\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\n            to avoid this risk-benefit analysis in a case where it is\n            required. Instructions based on the ordinary consumer\n            expectations prong of Barker are not appropriate where, as a\n            matter of law, the evidence would not support a jury verdict\n            on that theory. Whenever that is so, the jury must be\n            instructed solely on the alternative risk-benefit theory of\n            design defect announced in Barker.\n\n882 P.2d at 303, 309.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 131\n\faction are issues for the finder of fact, whether that finder of fact is judge or jury. A\n\nquestion of whether the party has met its burden of proof is properly “removed” -- for\n\nexample, via adjudication of a dispositive motion -- “from the jury’s consideration only\n\nwhere it is clear that reasonable minds [cannot] differ on the issue.” Hamil v. Bashline,\n\n392 A.2d 1280, 1284-85 (Pa. 1978). Thus, the strict liability construct we articulate\n\ntoday comfortably accommodates the gate-keeping role ordinarily relegated to the trial\n\ncourt in tort actions.\n\n       Our decision today allows for application of standards of proof in the alternative.\n\nObviously, other examples of such decisional paradigms exist. See, e.g., 18 Pa.C.S. §\n\n2503 (describing offense of voluntary manslaughter as action under heat of passion or\n\npremised upon imperfect belief of self-defense). In charging the jury, the trial court’s\n\nobjective is “to explain to the jury how it should approach its task and the factors it\n\nshould consider in reaching its verdict.”         Chambers, 980 A.2d at 49 (quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Hartman, 638 A.2d 968, 971 (Pa. 1994)). Where evidence supports\n\na party-requested instruction on a theory or defense, a charge on the theory or defense\n\nis warranted. Id. At that point, “[t]he trial court has broad discretion in phrasing its\n\ninstructions, and may choose its own wording so long as the law is clearly, adequately,\n\nand accurately presented to the jury for its consideration.” Sepulveda, 55 A.3d at 1141.\n\n       It is essential for the bench and bar to recognize that the test we articulate today\n\nis not intended as a rigid formula to be offered to the jury in all situations. The alternate\n\ntheories of proof contour the notion of “defective condition” in principled terms intended\n\nas comprehensive guidelines that are sufficiently malleable to account for product\n\ndiversity and a variety of legal claims, products, and applications of theory. The crucial\n\nrole of the trial court is to prepare a jury charge that explicates the meaning of “defective\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 132\n\fcondition” within the boundaries of the law, i.e., the alternative test standard, and the\n\nfacts that pertain. Cf. Soule, 882 P.2d at 308-11.\n\n\n\n                              b.     The Burden of Proof\n\n       Another consideration derived from existing precedent implicates the burden of\n\nproof in a strict liability case. As we have noted, California pioneered the alternate\n\nconsumer expectations / risk-utility balancing test as a prevailing standard of proof in\n\nstrict liability cases. See Barker, 573 P.2d at 457-58. The Barker court also concluded\n\nthat it was appropriate, when proceeding upon a risk-utility theory, to shift to the\n\ndefendant the burden of production and persuasion to demonstrate that an injury-\n\nproducing product is not defective in design.        Id. at 455.    Other jurisdictions have\n\nsubscribed to the Barker standard of proof, although only some of those courts have\n\nalso shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. Compare, e.g., Lamkin v. Towner,\n\n563 N.E.2d 449, 457 (Ill. 1990) with Knitz, 432 N.E.2d at 818. The similarity of the\n\napproach we have approved to the Barker standard of proof may raise a question of\n\nwhether Pennsylvania should also require a shifting of the burden of proof to the\n\ndefendant when the plaintiff proceeds upon a risk-utility theory.\n\n       Recently, in a case involving criminal law, this Court explained that: “[t]he\n\nfunction of a standard of proof, as that concept is embodied in the Due Process Clause\n\nand in the realm of factfinding, is to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of\n\nconfidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions\n\nfor a particular type of adjudication. While the risk of error in a particular adjudication\n\ndoes not vary depending on the standard of proof adopted, the burden allocates that\n\nrisk between the parties.” Sanchez, 36 A.3d at 65 (citations omitted). In strict liability\n\ncases, as ordinarily in other civil actions, the burden of proof is sustained by a\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 133\n\fpreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., Summers v. Certainteed Corp., 997 A.2d\n\n1152, 1163-64 (Pa. 2010) (quoting Hamil, 392 A.2d at 1284-85). A more stringent\n\nburden of production and persuasion imposes a higher risk of an erroneous decision on\n\nthe party upon which the burden rests.        Thus, shifting the burden of proof onto a\n\ndefendant places the risk of an erroneous decision upon the defendant.                  The\n\ndetermination of whether such a shift is suitable rests, as the Barker court also noted,\n\nprimarily on considerations of whether the shift vindicates the public policy at issue. In\n\naddition, we consider difficulties of adducing evidence to prove a negative, the parties’\n\nrelative access to evidence, and whether placing the burden of proof on one party is\n\nnecessary to help enforce a further right, constitutional or otherwise. See Sanchez, 36\n\nA.3d at 67.\n\n       Applying similar criteria, the Barker court reasoned that placing the burden on the\n\ndefendant was appropriate “[b]ecause most of the evidentiary matters which may be\n\nrelevant to the determination of the adequacy of a product’s design under the ‘risk-\n\nbenefit’ standard e.g., the feasibility and cost of alternative designs are similar to issues\n\ntypically presented in a negligent design case and involve technical matters peculiarly\n\nwithin the knowledge of the manufacturer.” According to Barker, the shift in the burden\n\nof proof reflected the policy judgment that “one of the principal purposes behind the\n\nstrict product liability doctrine is to relieve an injured plaintiff of many of the onerous\n\nevidentiary burdens inherent in a negligence cause of action.” 573 P.2d at 455.\n\n       The parties obviously have not briefed the question of burden-shifting in risk-\n\nutility cases -- they had no reason to -- and we need not decide it to resolve this appeal,\n\nnor is it apparent that it will matter upon remand.      We note, however, that whatever\n\nmay be the merit of the Barker court’s concerns, countervailing considerations may also\n\nbe relevant. For example, it is consistent with the treatment of tort causes of action\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 134\n\fgenerally, and the notion that Pennsylvania does not presume a product to be defective\n\nuntil proven otherwise, to assign the burden of proof in a strict liability case to the\n\nplaintiff. Moreover, proving a negative is generally not desirable as a jurisprudential\n\nmatter because of fairness concerns related to anticipating and rebutting allegations,\n\nand because of the encumbrances placed upon the judicial system by an open-ended\n\napproach to pleading and trying a case. Finally, evidence relevant to a risk-utility test,\n\nincluding the feasibility and cost of alternative designs, while involving technical matters,\n\nwould seem to be within the knowledge of expert witnesses available to either plaintiff or\n\ndefendant in many cases; and liberal discovery may also aid the plaintiff.\n\n       These interests, and others that we may not perceive, are implicated in\n\nanswering the question of whether the burden should be on the plaintiff or on the\n\ndefendant, generally or in particular cases involving a risk-utility theory. The ultimate\n\nanswer to the question best awaits balancing in an appropriate case, specifically raising\n\nthe question, with attendant briefing from parties.\n\n\n\n                               c.     Related Legal Issues\n\n       We recognize – and the bench and bar should recognize -- that the decision to\n\noverrule Azzarello and articulate a standard of proof premised upon alternative tests in\n\nrelation to claims of a product defective in design may have an impact upon other\n\nfoundational issues regarding manufacturing or warning claims, and upon subsidiary\n\nissues constructed from Azzarello, such as the availability of negligence-derived\n\ndefenses, bystander compensation, or the proper application of the intended use\n\ndoctrine. Accord Bugosh, 971 A.2d at 1244-45 & 1248-49. These considerations and\n\neffects are outside the scope of the facts of this dispute and, understandably, have not\n\nbeen briefed by the Tinchers or Omega Flex.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 135\n\f       This Opinion does not purport to either approve or disapprove prior decisional\n\nlaw, or available alternatives suggested by commentators or the Restatements, relating\n\nto foundational or subsidiary considerations and consequences of our explicit holdings.\n\nIn light of our prior discussion, the difficulties that justify our restraint should be readily\n\napparent.

Conclusion / Mandate\n\n       At the Court’s request, the parties briefed a question concerning whether\n\nadoption of the Third Restatement, if such a decision were to be made, would have\n\nretroactive or prospective effect. Having declined to “adopt” the Third Restatement, we\n\nneed not reach the question of retroactive or prospective application of the ruling.\n\nNevertheless, in light of the decision to overrule Azzarello, questions remain regarding\n\nwhether Omega Flex should benefit from the application of our Opinion upon remand\n\nand, moreover, whether Omega Flex is entitled to a new trial.            Here, Omega Flex\n\npreserved and presented its claim that Azzarello should be overruled to the trial court\n\nand on appeal; as a result, we hold that Omega Flex is entitled to the benefit of our\n\ndecision in this regard. Whether Omega Flex is entitled to additional relief, including a\n\nnew trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not apparent upon the record before\n\nus.   See Price, 735 A.2d at 672 (new trial appropriate if erroneous jury instruction\n\namounts to fundamental error or the record is insufficient to determine whether error\n\naffected verdict); Degenhardt, 669 A.2d at 950 (judgment notwithstanding verdict is\n\nappropriate only if no two reasonable minds could disagree that verdict should be in\n\nfavor of movant).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 136\n\f       For these reasons, we reverse in part the decision of the Superior Court in this\n\nmatter, and remand to the trial court for further action upon post-trial motions.

CHIEF JUSTICE CASTILLE                              DECIDED: November 19, 2014\n      Omega Flex, Inc., appeals the decision of the Superior Court to affirm the\n\njudgment on the verdict entered in favor of Terrence D. Tincher and Judith R. Tincher\n\n(the “Tinchers”) by the Chester County Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division. We\n\nreverse the Superior Court decision in part, upon reasoning different from that\n\narticulated by the courts below, and we remand to the trial court for further action upon\n\nOmega Flex’s post-trial motions, consistent with the principles elucidated in this\n\nOpinion. We hold that:\n\n             1.   This Court’s decision in Azzarello v. Black Brothers\n             Company, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1957128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1957128/azzarello-v-black-bros-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1978) is hereby overruled.\n\n             2.     Having considered the common law of Pennsylvania,\n             the provenance of the strict product liability cause of action,\n             the interests and the policy which the strict liability cause of\n\f              action vindicates, and alternative standards of proof utilized\n              in sister jurisdictions, we conclude that a plaintiff pursuing a\n              cause upon a theory of strict liability in tort must prove that\n              the product is in a “defective condition.” The plaintiff may\n              prove defective condition by showing either that (1) the\n              danger is unknowable and unacceptable to the average or\n              ordinary consumer, or that (2) a reasonable person would\n              conclude that the probability and seriousness of harm\n              caused by the product outweigh the burden or costs of\n              taking precautions.        The burden of production and\n              persuasion is by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n              3.     Whether a product is in a defective condition is a\n              question of fact ordinarily submitted for determination to the\n              finder of fact; the question is removed from the jury’s\n              consideration only where it is clear that reasonable minds\n              could not differ on the issue. Thus, the trial court is\n              relegated to its traditional role of determining issues of law,\n              e.g., on dispositive motions, and articulating the law for the\n              jury, premised upon the governing legal theory, the facts\n              adduced at trial and relevant advocacy by the parties.\n\n              4.     To the extent relevant here, we decline to adopt the\n              Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability §§ 1 et seq.,\n              albeit appreciation of certain principles contained in that\n              Restatement has certainly informed our consideration of the\n              proper approach to strict liability in Pennsylvania in the post-\n              Azzarello paradigm.\n\n\n\n                                   I.       Background\n\n        Around 2:30 a.m. on June 20, 2007, neighbors reported a fire that had erupted at\n\nthe home of the Tinchers in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.            The residence was the\n\ncentral unit of a two-story triplex built in 1998-99, and purchased by the Tinchers in\n\n2005.     The fire was eventually extinguished and no persons were harmed.\n\nSubsequently, investigators concluded that a lightning strike near the Tinchers’ home\n\ncaused a small puncture in the corrugated stainless steel tubing (“CSST”) transporting\n\nnatural gas to a fireplace located on the first floor of the residence. The CSST installed\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 2\n\fin the Tinchers’ home was manufactured and sold by Omega Flex as part of a gas\n\ntransportations system marketed as the TracPipe System.           The heat attending the\n\nmelting of the CSST caused by the lightning strike ignited the natural gas and fueled a\n\nfire estimated to have burned for over an hour. The fire caused significant damage to\n\nthe Tinchers’ home and belongings.\n\n        After the fire, the Tinchers reported the incident to their insurer, United Services\n\nAutomobile Association (“USAA”). USAA compensated the Tinchers for their loss up to\n\nthe limit of their policy and received an assignment of liability claims. The Tinchers\n\nsuffered an additional out-of-pocket loss because a portion of their claimed loss\n\nexceeded the limits of the USAA policy.\n\n        In January 2008, the Tinchers filed a complaint against Omega Flex in the\n\nChester County Court of Common Pleas.1 USAA prosecuted the claims in the name of\n\nthe Tinchers to obtain reimbursement of the insurance proceeds payout, but the\n\nTinchers retained an interest in the litigation to recover the losses exceeding their\n\ninsurance coverage. The Tinchers asserted claims premised upon theories of strict\n\nliability, negligence, and breach of warranty.\n\n        In relevant part, the Tinchers’ complaint relies upon the theory of strict liability\n\narticulated in Section 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts, but as followed and\n\nconstrued in Pennsylvania. Complaint, 3/18/2008, at ¶¶ 19-25 (citing RESTATEMENT (2D)\n\nOF   TORTS § 402A). The Tinchers alleged that Omega Flex is liable for damages to their\n\nhome caused by the placement on the market and sale of the TracPipe System.\n\n1\n       The Tinchers also named as defendants R & L Plumbing Contractors, Inc.,\nJoseph Rosati Plumbing, Inc., and Joseph R. Rosati, Jr., individually and d/b/a Joseph\nRosati Plumbing & Heating. Omega Flex asserted cross-claims against its co-\ndefendants. In October 2010, the Tinchers and Omega Flex voluntarily dismissed with\nprejudice all claims against these additional parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 3\n\fAccording to the Tinchers, the CSST incorporated into the TracPipe System is\n\ndefective, and unreasonably dangerous to intended users, because its walls are too thin\n\nto withstand the effects of lightning. The Tinchers requested compensatory damages,\n\ninterest, fees, and costs of litigation. Omega Flex answered the complaint denying the\n\nTinchers’ allegations. The matter was assigned to the Honorable Ronald C. Nagle,\n\nSenior Judge of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas. The parties proceeded\n\nwith discovery and the filing of dispositive motions, which the trial court denied.\n\n         In September 2010, in anticipation of trial, Omega Flex filed a motion in limine\n\nrequesting the application of Sections 1 and 2 of the Third Restatement of Torts to the\n\nTinchers’ strict liability claim. Omega Flex also proposed jury instructions and findings\n\nof fact consistent with the provisions of the Third Restatement. The Tinchers opposed\n\nOmega Flex’s motion in limine and offered proposed jury instructions and findings of\n\nfact consistent with the Second Restatement and Azzarello, supra. The trial court did\n\nnot resolve Omega Flex’s motion before trial. See Notes of Testimony, 8/12/2011, at\n\n17-22.\n\n         In October 2010, the parties proceeded to trial before a jury. At trial, the Tinchers\n\noffered evidence regarding the events of June 20, 2007, the subsequent investigation\n\ninto the cause of the fire, the losses sustained by the Tinchers, and USAA’s process of\n\nadjusting the insurance claim. The parties generally agreed that lightning had caused\n\nthe fire, although they disagreed as to the sequence of events or the cause of ignition in\n\nthe area of the fireplace. The Tinchers offered evidence that lightning transferred an\n\nelectrical charge to parts of the home, including the TracPipe System; the electrical\n\ncurrent then sought ground and created different electrical charges in the various metal\n\ncomponents of the structure. The Tinchers’ expert witnesses testified that a flow of\n\nenergy between a differently charged TracPipe and another metal component of the\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 4\n\fhome caused an electrical arc, and the accompanying heat punctured the CSST and\n\nignited the natural gas that the CSST transported. According to the Tinchers’ expert,\n\nthe perforation in the corrugated stainless steel tubing from the Tinchers’ home was\n\n“characteristic of a lightning strike, not anything else.” By comparison, Omega Flex’s\n\nwitnesses testified that lightning measured near the Tinchers’ home on the night of the\n\nfire did not carry sufficient energy to puncture the CSST. According to these witnesses,\n\nonce lightning entered the house, lightning-related high voltages -- although with low\n\nenergy -- broke down the insulation on electrical wires and, if the circuit breakers did not\n\ninterrupt the current, the electrical current caused the fire. Omega Flex also responded\n\nthat the conditions of the Tinchers’ home after the fire and after the investigation, during\n\nwhich part of the evidence had been removed from its original location, made it\n\nimpossible to confirm the Tinchers’ theory. Finally, Omega Flex offered evidence that\n\nan attempt had been made to bond the TracPipe System to the cold water pipe at the\n\nTinchers’ residence which, if successful, would have prevented the electrical arc -- and\n\nthe resulting fire -- from occurring. Witnesses testified that, after the fire, a bonding\n\nclamp had been found connected to the CSST and near but disconnected from the cold\n\nwater pipe. The parties offered competing testimony as to whether the clamp had been\n\nattached to the cold water pipe before the fire.\n\n       Relevant to their strict liability theory, the Tinchers offered testimony regarding a\n\ndefect in the TracPipe from experts in electrical engineering and metallurgy, electrical\n\narc physics, and material science -- Mr. Mark Goodson and Dr. Thomas Eager,\n\nrespectively. These experts opined that CSST is inherently defective because its wall is\n\n1/100 of an inch thick -- the width of four sheets of paper -- and, as a result, the\n\nprobability is “very high,” “close to a hundred percent,” that a lightning-generated current\n\nwill perforate it. By comparison, an alternative natural gas conduit made of black iron\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 5\n\fpipe is ten times thicker for a half-inch diameter pipe similar to the CSST present in the\n\nTincher home. According to the witnesses, CSST withstands the transfer of ten times\n\nless energy than black iron pipe and, given the same energy, the amount of time to\n\npuncture CSST is 1/100 the amount of time required to puncture black iron pipe.\n\nExperts estimated that an electric arc is fifty thousand to a million times more likely to\n\nperforate CSST than black iron pipe.\n\n       The witnesses acknowledged that the energy transferred by any particular\n\nlightning strike is difficult to predict and cannot be replicated in a lab, but concluded that\n\nthe probability was high that CSST would be punctured by occurrences within expected\n\nranges of electrical current.    Such results, according to the Tinchers’ experts, are\n\nobservable and predictable with equations developed in the Nineteenth Century.\n\nNevertheless, the experts noted that Omega Flex had not conducted testing on the\n\nTracPipe’s ability to withstand lightning strikes, although testing for resistance to\n\nlightning was necessary and available. Moreover, according to the Tinchers’ evidence,\n\nthe Omega Flex installation guide failed to direct compliance with lightning-related fire\n\nprotection codes.\n\n       The Tinchers’ witnesses also testified that Omega Flex recommended grounding\n\nthe TracPipe system by plugging any natural gas-fueled appliances into three-prong\n\noutlets. Additional grounding, although attempted at the Tinchers’ residence, was not\n\nrequired by the installation instructions provided by Omega Flex to professionals to\n\nwhom TracPipe was marketed and sold for installation in consumers’ homes.\n\nMoreover, according to the Tinchers’ experts, the bonding of the TracPipe System at\n\none location would be insufficient to protect the CSST from the effects of lightning. To\n\nbe effective, the witnesses testified, bonding would be required every ten feet, which the\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 6\n\fexperts deemed to be an impractical and unfeasible solution. The alternative would be\n\nto encase the CSST in black iron pipe. See N.T., 10/13/2010, at 291-98, 357-420.\n\n       After the Tinchers rested, Omega Flex moved for a nonsuit, citing the standard of\n\nthe Second Restatement and Azzarello; Omega Flex expressly assumed that the trial\n\ncourt had denied its request to apply the Third Restatement. N.T., 10/18/2010, at 514-\n\n16. The trial court denied the motion for a nonsuit. Id. at 525-26.\n\n       Subsequently, Omega Flex introduced the testimony of its own experts relating to\n\nthe defect in the TracPipe System alleged by the Tinchers. The witnesses were Dr.\n\nJames Dydo, an expert in metallurgy and mechanical engineering with a focus on fuel\n\ngas piping, and Dr. Michael Stringfellow, an expert in physics with a focus on lightning\n\nand the protection of structures from lightning. The Omega Flex experts opined that the\n\nTracPipe System is not defective or unreasonably dangerous. According to the defense\n\nexperts, CSST is a technology with significant advantages, including resistance to\n\ncorrosion, structural shifts, and mechanical ruptures; ease of installation, relocation, and\n\nretrofitting; and fewer joints accompanied by decreased susceptibility to natural gas\n\nleaks at any required joints. The experts noted that these net benefits are marked\n\nadvantages over black iron pipe arising from the flexibility of CSST. If CSST’s walls\n\nwere thickened, according to the experts, there would be little practical difference\n\nbetween CSST and black iron pipe.\n\n       The defense witnesses also testified that the TracPipe System meets and\n\nexceeds all standards for minimum performance governing CSST developed by the\n\nAmerican National Standards Institute, a clearinghouse for trade groups. Additionally,\n\nthe witnesses stated, installation of the TracPipe System conforms with the Fuel Gas\n\nCode and the National Electric Code in force in 1998-99. The experts emphasized that\n\nthese applicable standards did not anticipate intrusion by lightning as a possible safety\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 7\n\fconcern, suggesting that it was unnecessary for Omega Flex to have foreseen any\n\ndanger from lightning.\n\n       Finally, Omega Flex’s experts agreed that the installation instructions for the\n\nTracPipe System did not require installation of a bonding clamp. The witnesses also\n\nnoted, however, that a disconnected clamp was consistent with Omega Flex’s\n\nassessment of the circumstances surrounding the fire. The experts offered that the\n\nattempt to bond the TracPipe System to the cold water pipe was inadequate and that a\n\nsuccessful attempt would have likely averted the resulting fire. Id. at 657-712.\n\n       After resting its defense, Omega Flex offered a motion for a directed verdict\n\npremised upon Second Restatement principles and Azzarello. Omega Flex argued that\n\nproof of the overall risks and benefits of the TracPipe System, and of any reasonable\n\nalternative designs, showed that TracPipe was not unreasonably dangerous. The trial\n\ncourt denied the motion for a directed verdict.             Both parties then offered closing\n\narguments on their respective theories of the case.               Subsequently, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury with respect to the Tinchers’ strict liability claim as follows:\n\n\n                      The contention of the [Tinchers] in this case is that\n              there is a defect in this product, this TracPipe. To state a\n              products liability claim, essentially it’s strict liability, a plaintiff\n              must prove, first, that the product was defective. Second,\n              that if [sic] a defect existed when it left the hands of the\n              defendant, that is, left the process by which it was produced\n              at the defendant[‘s] plant. And three, that the defect caused\n              the harm.\n\n                       A product is defective when it is not safe for its\n              intended purpose. That is, it leaves the suppliers’ control\n              lacking any element necessary to make it safe for its\n              intended use. The inquiry is whether or not there is a defect,\n              not whether the defendant[’s] conduct was negligent. In\n              strict liability there is no consideration of negligence. It is\n              simply, was the product defective or wasn’t it defective.\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 8\n\f                    *      *      *       *\n\n         Defective design. The manufactur[er] of a product is\nreally a guarantor of its safety. When we talk about strict\nliability, the product must be provided with every element\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use. And without\nany conditions that make[] it unsafe for its intended use. If\nyou find that the product in this case, the TracPipe, at the\ntime it left the defendant[’s] control, lacked any elements\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use, or contained\nany condition that made it unsafe for its intended use, and\nthere was an alternative more practical design, more safer\n[sic] design, then the product is considered defective and the\ndefendant is liable for the harm, if you find that defect\ncaused the harm[,] was the proximate cause of the harm to\nthe plaintiffs.\n\n         Now, ladies and gentlemen, a product is not defective\nmerely because it is possible to be injured while using the\nproduct. The imposition of strict liability is not meant to\ntransform manufacturers into insurers of all injuries that are\npotentially possible and [sic] at the hands of a product. A\nmanufacturer of a product may be a guarantor of the\nproduct[’s] safety, but under no circumstances is the\nmanufacturer an insurer of the safety of the product. The\nlaw does not force the manufacturer to become the insurer\nof the product under all conditions and uses.                A\nmanufacturer is not required to make an already safe\nproduct safer, or to utilize the safest of all designs. The\nmanufacturer is not required to produce or design a product\nincorporating only features representing the ultimate in\nsafety design. To prevail on a design defect theory, plaintiffs\nmust prove that the product is defective and that at the time\nit left the control of the manufacturer it lacked the feature\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use, or contained a\nfeature that made it unsafe for its intended use.\n\n        In other words, you may not find that the TracPipe\nproduct is defective merely because it could have been\nmade safer. Instead, you may only render a verdict for the\nplaintiff if you conclude and are convinced that the TracPipe\nis in fact defective and was so when it left the hands of the\n\n\n                        [J-80-2013] - 9\n\fmanufacturer and that defect was the proximate cause of the\n[Tinchers’] loss.\n\n         As I said before, and I instruct you that in order to\nestablish strict liability for putting a defective product in the\nstream of commerce, the plaintiffs are not required to prove\nthat the defendant was negligent. Negligence and strict\nliability are two separate concepts. I’ll get to negligence in a\nsecond. And no consideration should be given to negligence\nwhen considering strict liability for a defective product. It’s\ntwo different concepts. I understand it’s not the easiest thing\nto keep in mind. I’m trying to point out there is a difference\nbetween strict liability for putting a defective product that was\ndefective when it was designed and made in this stream of\ncommerce that causes harm to someone else, an intended\nuser, not just any user, but an intend[ed] user of that\nproduct.\n\n         Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, if this product was\nmanufactured and, obviously, the -- with all of the testimony\nin this case and the steps that were taken during the design\nand manufacturing process, Omega Flex knew it was going\nto be used for its intended purposes, to carry gas[,] natural\ngas, the manufacturer supplying the pipe guaranteed it\nwould be safe for its intend[ed] use. That is what strict\nliability means. So if something that is intended to be safe\nfor the use intended to be made of it is not, and it’s proven\nthat it’s not, and that proof has to come from the plaintiff, and\nthat defect is the proximate cause of what happens, there is\na lot of testimony in this case about that, then that is what\nstrict liability means. It does not have anything to do with\nnegligence in that aspect of the case. That is why the risk of\nloss, or if there is, or if you find there is a defect in strict\nliability, the risk of loss is placed upon the supplier or\nmanufacturer that put that product in this stream of\ncommerce. The risk of loss for injuries resulting from the\ndefective product is best warned [sic] by the person who\nmanufactured it, principally because they are the ones that\nput it in the stream of commerce and said it would work for\nits intended purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                       [J-80-2013] - 10\n\fN.T., 10/19/2010, at 794-98. Additionally, the trial court defined “proximate cause,” and\n\ninstructed the jury with respect to damages.          Id. at 802-07.    After the trial court\n\nconcluded its instructions on the law, counsel for Omega Flex noted for the record that\n\nOmega Flex had proposed instructions based upon the Third Restatement with respect\n\nto the strict liability claim and that any Second Restatement instructions it proposed\n\nwere offered in the alternative. The trial court responded that it had declined to instruct\n\nthe jury in accordance with Third Restatement principles because Pennsylvania\n\nappellate courts, and the Supreme Court especially, had not adopted the Third\n\nRestatement.\n\n       Subsequently, the jury returned to the courtroom with several questions.\n\nRelevant here, the trial court answered the jury by repeating definitions for the terms\n\n“defect” and “defective design” as offered in the original instructions.\n\n       On October 20, 2010, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Tinchers on the\n\nproducts liability claim, and awarded compensatory damages totaling $958,895.85.\n\nDamages were divided as follows: $406,532.90 (building); $988.83 (additional property\n\nand structures); $503,945.58 (contents); and $47,428.64 (alternate living expenses).\n\nThe trial court added $69,336.05 in delay damages, and entered judgment on the\n\nverdict.2   In November 2010, Omega Flex filed a motion for post-trial relief and\n\nsupporting brief requesting, among other things, a new trial premised upon trial court\n\nerrors in denying its motion in limine and in failing to instruct the jury on the law as\n\narticulated in the Third Restatement.        Additionally, Omega Flex sought judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the theory that the evidence introduced at trial was\n\ninsufficient to prove a claim of strict liability under Third Restatement principles.\n\n2\n      The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Omega Flex on the negligence claim.\nThere are no claims before this Court related to this part of the verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 11\n\f       Relating to the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Omega Flex\n\nargued that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to prove a\n\nstrict liability claim under the Third Restatement. In overlapping claims of error, Omega\n\nFlex also asserted that the Tinchers had not met their burden of proof under the so-\n\ncalled “fireworthiness” doctrine, which, as Omega Flex explained in its supporting brief,\n\nwas a Third-Restatement-like approach similar to the more familiar “crashworthiness”\n\nexception to the Second Restatement.

With respect to the motion for a new trial, Omega Flex\n\nalleged that the trial court erred in denying its motion in limine seeking to conduct the\n\ntrial in accordance with Third Restatement principles, and in failing to issue a jury\n\ncharge premised upon the Third Restatement or the fireworthiness / crashworthiness\n\ndoctrine.\n\n       In the brief supporting the post-trial motion, Omega Flex distilled what were\n\nseveral Third Restatement and fireworthiness doctrine claims into two main arguments.\n\nFirst, according to Omega Flex, judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial were\n\nappropriate under the Second Restatement because lightning protection, the safe\n\nconduction of electricity, or even a foreseeable event such as the fire are not intended\n\nuses of the TracPipe System. In the alternative, Omega Flex argued that, once the\n\nTinchers offered evidence that lightning was a “foreseeable” event, the dispute\n\nparadigm changed from a typical Second Restatement design defect case to a\n\nfireworthiness / crashworthiness case, which required the trial court to issue a jury\n\ninstruction that the Tinchers had the burden to prove the existence of an alternative\n\nsafer design similar to the burden articulated by the Third Restatement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 12\n\f       Second, Omega Flex argued that a new trial was appropriate because the trial\n\ncourt failed to charge the jury on the Third Restatement, which in its view stated the\n\nrelevant principle of law applicable to the circumstances alleged by the Tinchers.\n\nOmega Flex argued that application of the Third Restatement was supported by\n\nresponsive opinions authored and joined by several Justices of this Court and the\n\ndecision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Berrier v. Simplicity Mfg.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264569\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264569/berrier-v-simplicity-mfg-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2009).

Returning to its\n\nfireworthiness doctrine theory, Omega Flex emphasized that the trial court’s Azzarello-\n\nbased instructions on the Second Restatement confused the jury: first, by mentioning,\n\nwithout explaining, the relevance of evidence of a proposed alternative design, i.e., the\n\nblack pipe system; second, by failing to guide the jury on the burden of proof relating to\n\nthe alternative design; and, third, by failing to explain how the jury should consider the\n\nrole of lightning in assessing liability. Additionally, Omega Flex argued that the failure to\n\ncharge the jury, and relatedly the absence from the verdict sheet, of foreseeability-\n\nbased principles and elements related to the existence of a safer alternative design,\n\nerroneously lessened the Tinchers’ burden of proof. Id. at 31-40.\n\n       In response, the Tinchers asserted that the “fireworthiness” instruction requested\n\nby Omega Flex had no applicability to the Tinchers’ circumstances.            The Tinchers\n\nexplained that the decision in General Services was distinguishable on the facts: in\n\nGeneral Services, the product released harmful chemicals when exposed to a fire\n\ncaused by unrelated events; because the fire was not an intended use of the product,\n\nthis Court held that strict liability principles were inapplicable.    By comparison, the\n\nTinchers noted that the allegations in this matter were that the defect in CSST even\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 13\n\fwhen employed for its intended use, i.e., carrying natural gas, caused the fire; these\n\nallegations implicated a manufacturer’s strict liability for the alleged defect.       The\n\nTinchers then argued that the evidence offered at trial was sufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s gateway decision related to the risk-utility analysis as well as the jury’s ultimate\n\nverdict. The Tinchers also responded that the Third Restatement was not applicable in\n\nPennsylvania and that, until this Court adopts the Third Restatement, the governing law\n\nremains the Second Restatement.        Moreover, the Tinchers asserted that the Third\n\nCircuit’s prediction that this Court would eventually adopt the Third Restatement is\n\npremature and unwarranted, citing the Superior Court decisions in Gaudio, supra, and\n\nFrench v. Commonwealth Associates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2306029\"><a href=\"/opinion/2306029/french-v-commonwealth-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Super. 2009). Appellees’ Brief\n\nin Opposition to Motion for Post-Trial Relief, 3/9/2011, at 2-15. At oral argument on the\n\npost-trial motion, the parties offered similar arguments focusing on the fireworthiness\n\ndoctrine. Omega Flex noted that the case was appropriate for application of the Third\n\nRestatement and emphasized the claims of jury confusion, but agreed not to press\n\narguments relating to the adoption of the Third Restatement at the trial court level. N.T.,\n\n3/11/2011, at 9-10; 39-43. The trial court denied the motion. On June 2, 2011, the trial\n\ncourt entered judgment on the verdict, in the amount of $1,028,231.90.\n\n       Omega Flex appealed the judgment to the Superior Court.              The trial court\n\nordered Omega Flex to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal.\n\nOrder, 6/17/2011 (per curiam) (citing Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)). In its Rule 1925(b) statement,\n\nOmega Flex raised related claims of error, in relevant part, that the evidence introduced\n\nat trial was insufficient to prove claims of strict liability under the Second and Third\n\nRestatements; and that the jury should have been charged and offered a verdict form\n\npremised upon the Third Restatement or the related theory of fireworthiness /\n\ncrashworthiness.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 14\n\f       In the post-trial relief and Rule 1925(a) opinions, the trial court rejected Omega\n\nFlex’s arguments. The trial court found no error in declining to apply and instruct the\n\njury on the Third Restatement, reasoning that this Court had yet to adopt that iteration of\n\ntort law to replace the Second Restatement. The trial court noted that, while Omega\n\nFlex “may have the right to advance on appeal to our Supreme Court that it should\n\nadopt the [Third Restatement], under current law, [the Tinchers] bore no burden to\n\nprove a safer alternate design existed in accordance with the latter standard.” Trial\n\nCourt Op., 8/5/2011, at 11.\n\n       In addition, the trial court explained that a “fireworthiness” instruction -- as an\n\nextension of the “crashworthiness” doctrine, requiring “a more rigorous standard of proof\n\nthan the usual [Second Restatement] claim,” was not appropriate either, because\n\nTracPipe had been employed for its intended use. According to the trial court, the\n\nTinchers’ case did not relate to how the TracPipe performed during the fire, as in\n\nGeneral Services; rather, the defect in the TracPipe they pursued was the proximate\n\ncause of the Tinchers’ injuries. The trial court held that the trial court rather than the\n\njury properly decided the question of a feasible alternative design, and that the Tinchers\n\nhad carried their burden of proof.\n\n       The parties offered arguments in their briefing to the Superior Court on issues\n\nsimilar to those raised in the post-trial motion and Rule 1925(b) statement. Relating to\n\nthe Third Restatement, Omega Flex acknowledged that decisions of this Court bound\n\nthe lower court, but offered that this case would be a fitting vehicle for this Court to\n\nrevisit strict liability standards.   According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement\n\nexpressly incorporates foreseeability standards into the strict liability analysis, and\n\nrequires a plaintiff to establish the existence of a reasonable alternative design for the\n\nfactfinder.   The trial court, Omega Flex argued, following existing decisional law,\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 15\n\finstructed the jury inadequately, noting in particular that the Tinchers were not “required\n\nto prove the existence of a feasible alternative design to prevail on [their] strict-liability\n\nclaim.” Omega Flex claimed that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict premised upon error in instructing the jury, and requested a\n\nnew trial on this basis. Appellant’s Super. Ct. Brief at 33-36. The Tinchers responded\n\nthat Omega Flex’s arguments relating to the Third Restatement have no legal support.\n\nAccording to the Tinchers, the Second Restatement and its derivative decisional law\n\nremains the law in Pennsylvania, and this Court rejected moving to the Third\n\nRestatement on several occasions, including after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\n\nThird Circuit predicted its adoption.\n\n       In September 2012, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment, among other\n\nthings holding that the trial court did not err in declining to adopt the Third Restatement.\n\nThe court also rejected Omega Flex’s claim of error premised upon the fireworthiness\n\ntheory, concluding that although the occurrence of lightning was arguably random and\n\ninfrequent, lightning is a naturally occurring phenomenon outside the control of the\n\nTinchers, who were using the product for its intended use. As a result, the court held\n\nthat the Tinchers’ claims implicated notions of strict liability, and the Tinchers had\n\ncarried their burden of proof under the Second Restatement and Azzarello. Moreover,\n\nthe court concluded that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedent, which\n\nremained premised upon the Second Restatement, following this Court’s then-recent\n\ndecision in Beard v. Johnson & Johnson, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2297606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2297606/beard-v-johnson-and-johnson-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 2012).

The Tinchers agree that Azzarello\n\nwas wrongly decided but argue in favor of otherwise retaining the principles of liability of\n\nthe Second Restatement.\n\n        Omega Flex begins by noting that Pennsylvania recognized strict liability in 1966.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 16 (citing Webb v. Zern, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1966); RESTATEMENT\n\n(2D)   OF   TORTS § 402A).    According to Omega Flex, the Second Restatement was\n\n“focused” on allegations of manufacturing defects rather than design defects and did not\n\naddress the latter “meaningfully, if at all.”         Nevertheless, Omega Flex recounts,\n\nPennsylvania and other jurisdictions have applied the Second Restatement articulation\n\nto design defects.        Omega Flex states that early applications of the Second\n\nRestatement in Pennsylvania called for a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the\n\n\n\n                                          [J-80-2013] - 17\n\fproduct, as designed, was defective or unreasonably dangerous; this approach “was\n\nsquarely in the mainstream of American tort law.” But, in 1978, according to Omega\n\nFlex, the decision in Azzarello altered the legal landscape of products liability in\n\nPennsylvania by divorcing products strict liability from principles of negligence, and by\n\ndirecting the trial court -- rather than the jury -- to make the only determination, upon a\n\nlower burden of proof, regarding the defectiveness / dangerousness of the product.\n\n       Omega Flex argues that Azzarello is theoretically unsound and unworkable in\n\npractice, suggesting that we should disapprove the decision.           Initially, Omega Flex\n\nclaims that a core principle familiar in negligence law -- reasonableness -- inherently\n\ninfuses strict liability law: a product is defective only if “unreasonably” dangerous.\n\nOmega Flex explains that a manufacturer is not the insurer of the consumer for any\n\ninjury caused by its product and may be held liable only if the product is “defective.” As\n\na practical matter, according to Omega Flex, a design is not defective “in the abstract,”\n\nas a function of the injury caused a particular plaintiff, but as a function of its risks and\n\nutilities. Omega Flex emphasizes that any product may cause injury, yet not every\n\nproduct is “defective” as that concept is properly understood in the law of strict liability --\n\nof note are inherently dangerous products such as knives and lighters. On this premise,\n\nOmega Flex suggests that the risk-utility calculus is essentially a matter of whether the\n\nmanufacturer departed from the proper and reasonable standards of care.                    “To\n\ncondemn a design for being unreasonably dangerous is inescapably to condemn the\n\ndesigner for having been negligent.”          Appellant’s Brief at 29 (citing James A.\n\nHenderson, Jr. and Aaron D. Twerski, ACHIEVING A CONSENSUS           ON   DEFECTIVE PRODUCT\n\nDESIGN, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 867, 919 (1998)). From this perspective, Omega Flex\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 18\n\fargues, the conceptual wall of separation between strict liability and negligence initially\n\narticulated by Azzarello has “no practical significance.”3\n\n       Omega Flex notes that the Azzarello Court did not purport to depart from the\n\nSecond Restatement principle that a defective design analysis is an inquiry into the care\n\nexercised by the manufacturer; the decision did not require proof of a defect separate\n\nfrom proof that the product was unreasonably dangerous. The difficulty, according to\n\nOmega Flex, is that the Court’s decision nevertheless prohibited the trial court from\n\nsubmitting to the jury the factual question of whether the product was unreasonably\n\ndangerous. Omega Flex notes that, per Azzarello, juries are instructed to determine\n\nwhether a product is defective unmoored from any inquiry into the product’s risks and\n\nutilities and the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s conduct. Omega Flex suggests\n\nthat the Azzarello approach creates an illusory separation between a product defect and\n\na manufacturer’s conduct, which constitutes a departure from the Second Restatement\n\nthe Court was purporting to follow.\n\n       Additionally, Omega Flex criticizes the Azzarello decision for relegating the risk-\n\nutility inquiry to a threshold matter of whether the defect issue may be submitted to the\n\njury, and placing that inquiry into the hands of the trial judge. Omega Flex suggests that\n\nthe Azzarello decision thereby lowers the burden on the plaintiff to prove that a product\n\n\n3\n       Omega Flex surmises that the conceptual separation and the related idea that\nthe notion of “foreseeability” has no role in a strict liability case framed the parties’\ndispute as one over whether exposure to lightning was an intended condition of using\nthe TracPipe System. The Superior Court, according to Omega Flex, focused instead\non whether the Tinchers could have avoided the harm rather than on the product,\nnecessarily injecting negligence concepts into the strict liability inquiry. Premised upon\nthese descriptions, Omega Flex emphasizes that this case reflects an “overlap” of\nnegligence principles with the proper application of strict liability law.

Omega Flex argues that Azzarello creates an anomalous process:\n\nAzzarello requires a risk-utility analysis dispositive of the claim, but prevents the jury-\n\nfactfinder from reviewing the relevant evidence and, in essence, does not permit either\n\nthe trial court or the jury to actually decide whether a product is unreasonably\n\ndangerous because its risks outweigh its benefits. “[T]rial courts are permitted to decide\n\nonly whether the evidence is sufficient to submit th[e cost-benefit] issue to the jury, but\n\nthey are prohibited from actually submitting it.” Id. at 31 (quoting John M.

Omega Flex does not\ndevelop this assertion and, as a result, we do not address it in any detail.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 20\n\fany reference to whether the product was unreasonably dangerous.             Omega Flex\n\nargues that, absent a determination of whether the risk was unreasonable, the jury may\n\nwell have found that any risk -- including a justified risk -- rendered the TracPipe System\n\ndefective. The Azzarello instruction, Omega Flex claims, does not offer the jury any\n\nguidance as to the critical concepts of defect and whether the product is “safe for its\n\nintended use.” Moreover, Omega Flex argues that the use of the term of art “guarantor”\n\nin relation to the product, without any explanation of its meaning, misleads the jury into\n\nholding manufacturers absolutely liable for any injuries caused by the product. Omega\n\nFlex further offers that the jury’s verdict in its favor on the negligence claim here\n\nsuggests confusion of the jury with respect to the standards applicable to the strict\n\nliability claim. The Azzarello instructions, Omega Flex emphasizes, have “profoundly\n\nunfair consequences” to a manufacturer against whom design defect claims are made.\n\nId. at 35-38.\n\n       Premised upon its criticism, Omega Flex advocates that this Court should\n\ndisapprove the Azzarello decision. Omega Flex acknowledges the principle of stare\n\ndecisis but argues that the Court is not bound to perpetuate the application of unsound\n\nand unworkable precedent.       Appellant’s Brief at 41-42 (citing, inter alia, Stilp v.\n\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192923\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192923/stilp-v-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 966-67 (Pa. 2006); Hack v.

Omega\n\nFlex recommends the Third Restatement on the grounds that its articulation of the law is\n\nspecifically intended to address design defects and represents the current mainstream\n\nview on the topic. According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement was drafted by “two\n\nprominent product-liability scholars,” Professors James Henderson and Aaron Twerski,\n\nand was reviewed in a comprehensive process. Appellant’s Brief at 45. Omega Flex\n\ndescribes the Third Restatement as requiring, in design defect cases, a balancing of\n\nrisks and benefits by the finder of fact, upon consideration of a broad range of factors.\n\nThe critical distinction in approaches, as described by Omega Flex, is that “the plaintiff\n\ncould not simply criticize the existing design; instead, the plaintiff would be required to\n\nprove that the manufacturer could and should have adopted a reasonable alternative\n\ndesign.” Id. at 47 (citing RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2(b) cmt. d).\n\nOmega Flex argues that the Third Restatement approach is already the accepted\n\npractice in “crashworthiness” cases (as an exception to Azzarello) and is “neither\n\ninsurmountable nor unduly onerous,” permitting plaintiffs to prevail “regularly” in such\n\ncases.

According to Omega Flex, the Court has the opportunity in this case “to return\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 22\n\fPennsylvania to the mainstream of American tort law in strict-liability design-defect\n\ncases” by embracing the Third Restatement’s “closely reasoned and balanced\n\napproach.” Id. at 48-49 (quoting Phillips and Bugosh, supra). Premised upon these\n\narguments, Omega Flex requests a new trial on the strict liability claim conducted under\n\nthe Third Restatement approach.\n\n       The Tinchers respond that the decision of the Superior Court should be affirmed,\n\nand strict liability actions in Pennsylvania should continue to be governed by the Second\n\nRestatement.5 According to the Tinchers, establishing the liability of a manufacturer on\n\n5\n       Initially, the Tinchers suggest that the “Court should decline consideration of the\nissue [on which we granted allowance of appeal], as it is not outcome determinative,\nand affirm the lower court ruling.” According to the Tinchers, the circumstances of this\nparticular case required the Tinchers to offer evidence at trial that was sufficient to meet\nthe requirements of the Second Restatement and Azzarello, as well as the Third\nRestatement. The Tinchers argue that, as a result, “[l]iability for the defective design of\nthe TracPipe product” -- and the jury’s verdict -- “is appropriate under either\nRestatement standard.” The Tinchers claim that a judicial determination of the issue\nupon which we granted appeal would be an advisory opinion with no legal effect.\nAppellees’ Brief at 11-17.\n\n       The suggested approach is unpersuasive. The case was tried as it was tried,\nwhich was according to the Second Restatement and Azzarello. This Court granted\nallowance of appeal to address an issue of law, properly preserved and presented by\nOmega Flex, regarding the very manner in which the legal theories and options were\napportioned between court and jury, and then the issues as posed to the jury. The\nquestion of whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict is outside\nthe scope of the appeal.\n\n        Moreover, even if sufficiency of the evidence were implicated and was disputed\non appeal, this Court does not test the sufficiency of the evidence in the abstract: the\nCourt would have to engage the manner in which the Tinchers articulated their claims,\nthe theory of strict liability they pursued and, most importantly, the manner in which the\ntrial court responded and actually instructed the jury on the strict liability claim. A trial\ncourt’s charge defines the legal universe in which a jury operates for the purposes of the\nverdict. See Commonwealth v. Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2555812\"><a href=\"/opinion/2555812/commonwealth-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201-02 & n.9 (Pa. 2010). Yet, in\nthis argument, the Tinchers invite the Court to address whether the principles of the\nThird Restatement (a theory outside the legal universe of the jury’s task here) was an\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 23\n\fa strict liability theory is a two-step process in Pennsylvania: (1) the trial court\n\ndetermines as a threshold matter whether a product is unreasonably dangerous and, as\n\na result, whether strict liability should be submitted to the jury; and (2) the jury-factfinder\n\ndecides whether the product at issue lacks any element necessary to make it safe for its\n\nintended use -- or, is defective. The determination of whether a product is unreasonably\n\ndangerous implicates a balancing of risks and utilities. Appellees’ Brief at 19-20 (citing\n\nAzzarello, 391 A.2d at 1026).\n\n       The Tinchers posit that concepts of negligence have no place in strict liability\n\nactions, explaining that strict liability is premised upon a social policy of holding\n\nmanufacturers responsible for casting a defective product into the stream of commerce.\n\nStrict liability, the Tinchers argue, reflects a change in social policy from the principle of\n\ncaveat emptor -- buyer beware -- to the view that a supplier of products is a guarantor of\n\nits products’ safety.    The Tinchers suggest that, in the modern marketplace, the\n\nemphasis is on protecting consumers and shifting the risk of loss for injury onto\n\nsuppliers of products because suppliers are in a better position to absorb or distribute\n\nthe loss as a cost of doing business. Id. at 21 (quoting Azzarello, supra). According to\n\nthe Tinchers, twenty-five years after Azzarello, the fundamental reasons for retaining a\n\nseparation between negligence and strict liability remain, and the Second Restatement\n\nstrikes the appropriate balance. The Second Restatement, the Tinchers argue, “makes\n\nit clear that the imposition of strict liability for a product defect is not affected by the fact\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\nappropriate basis for that jury’s verdict. It would not be. See Schmidt, 11 A.3d at 944\n(“The bare litmus of sufficiency review cannot correct a fundamental error in the\ninstructions to lay jurors concerning just what it is that they are deciding.”). Accord\nAppellant’s Reply Brief at 5. Accordingly, we reject the Tinchers’ invitation to summarily\naffirm the decision of the Superior Court on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 24\n\fthat the manufacturer or other supplier has exercised ‘all possible care’”; in the\n\nTinchers’ view, the compartmentalizing of negligence and strict liability is necessary to\n\nensure that manufacturers are held responsible for their products regardless of fault. Id.\n\nat 22 (quoting Phillips, supra).\n\n       According to the Tinchers, the decision in Azzarello “represents strict liability in\n\nits purest form” because it places the emphasis on scrutinizing the product rather than\n\nthe manufacturer’s conduct. The Tinchers note that a manufacturer’s liability is limited\n\nto defective products. The Tinchers claim that “defect” is difficult to define: the critical\n\nconsideration is whether the product is unreasonably dangerous.           According to the\n\nTinchers, because the question of unreasonable dangerousness “could easily be\n\nconfused by a jury as importing concepts of negligence into a strict liability analysis,” the\n\nAzzarello Court directed that decision to the trial court rather than to the jury. The\n\ndecision, the Tinchers explain, implicates the balancing of social policies “best\n\nperformed by the [trial] court in making a determination [of] law” and acting as a gate-\n\nkeeper to prevent claims regarding certain products from reaching the jury.\n\n       The Tinchers argue that the Third Restatement abandons a pure strict liability\n\nanalysis in favor of negligence principles.       According to the Tinchers, the Third\n\nRestatement explicitly provides for consideration of “foreseeable risks of harm proposed\n\nby the product,” which is a negligence standard. The Tinchers suggest that the Third\n\nRestatement is not a “natural” and “modest” evolution of strict liability but a “calamitous”\n\ndisplacement of the social policy established by forty-seven years of Second\n\nRestatement precedent. The Tinchers argue that “[s]uch a radical departure . . . is not\n\nprudent or necessary.”\n\n       The Tinchers also note that a “clear minority” of states have adopted the Third\n\nRestatement: one state -- Iowa – expressly, and several others have adopted single\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 25\n\fsections of the Restatement or have used the doctrine as guidance for the formulation\n\nof the common law.

Other states, according to the Tinchers, have considered\n\nand explicitly declined to adopt the Third Restatement.

This exception, according to the Tinchers, is accepted as such in\n\n“virtually every [U.S.] jurisdiction” and is typically applied to cases in which an alleged\n\ndefect did not cause the automobile accident or initial impact, but served to increase the\n\nseverity of the injury. The Tinchers argue that “crashworthiness” doctrine cases offer no\n\nindication that a jurisdiction has embraced the alternative design requirements of the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 26\n\fThird Restatement. Appellees’ Brief at 31 (citing Patrick Lavelle, CRASHING INTO PROOF\n\nOF A   REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE DESIGN; THE FALLACY        OF THE   RESTATEMENT (THIRD)   OF\n\nTORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY, 38 Duq. L. Rev. 1059, 1098-99 (2000)).            The Tinchers\n\nmaintain that any suggestion -- including in the reporters’ commentary to Section 2(b) --\n\nthat the Third Restatement standards are widely accepted is inaccurate and misleading\n\nbecause it is simply premised upon cases addressing the crashworthiness doctrine\n\nexception. Id. at 32 (citing RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2(b) cmt.\n\nd & nn. II-A, II-C (1997)).\n\n        Finally, the Tinchers argue that the Third Restatement would accomplish a\n\n“radical departure” from existing public policy because it would impose “an undue\n\nhardship on plaintiffs in the pursuit of meritorious claims.” According to the Tinchers,\n\nthe Third Restatement shifts the emphasis from the existing product to speculation of\n\nwhat similar product could have been designed.           In the Tinchers’ view, the Third\n\nRestatement represents “an instrument of tort reform” rather than an articulation of\n\nexisting law, which will impose a prohibitive cost on plaintiffs and counsel to produce\n\nalternative designs in the pursuit of otherwise meritorious claims. Id. at 33-34 (citing\n\nGary Wilson et al, THE FUTURE   OF   PRODUCTS LIABILITY   IN   AMERICA, 27 Wm. Mitchell L.\n\nRev. 85, 99-100 (2000); Frank J. Vandall and Joshua F. Vandall, A CALL             FOR AN\n\nACCURATE RESTATEMENT (THIRD)     OF   TORTS: DESIGN DEFECT, 33 U. Mem. L. Rev. 909,\n\n923 (2003)).     The Third Restatement, according to the Tinchers, is a boon to\n\nmanufacturers by placing at a “tremendous disadvantage” injured consumers who\n\nwould necessarily have to become experts and seek to redesign the product that\n\ncaused the injury; the cost of this exercise may exceed the benefit of a recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the Tinchers argue that the attendant costs of representing an injured\n\nplaintiff in a Third Restatement jurisdiction would discourage counsel from representing\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 27\n\finjured consumers. The Tinchers suggest that application of the Third Restatement\n\nwould vitiate the public policy upon which products liability law is premised, i.e., of\n\nholding manufacturers liable for defects in products placed in the stream of commerce;\n\nmanufacturers are in a better position to absorb the costs of injuries than are individual\n\nconsumers.\n\n       In an alternative argument, the Tinchers suggest that the Court could disapprove\n\nAzzarello but continue to apply the Second Restatement rather than the Third\n\nRestatement articulation of the law. The Tinchers note that this resolution of the matter\n\nwould protect the social policies underlying products liability yet remove any difficulties\n\ncaused by the decision in Azzarello.      See Appellees’ Brief at 41 n.16.       Ultimately,\n\nhowever, the Tinchers ask the Court to affirm the decision of the Superior Court.\n\n       In reply, Omega Flex reiterates its position that the differences between the\n\nSecond Restatement and the Third Restatement are modest; the difficulty with\n\nPennsylvania’s approach to products liability instead results from the application of\n\nAzzarello. Omega Flex suggests that the Tinchers do not oppose a disposition of this\n\nappeal in which the Court would disapprove Azzarello, although the parties disagree\n\nwhether the Court should go further and adopt the Third Restatement. With regard to\n\nthe Third Restatement, Omega Flex argues that the “reasonable alternative design”\n\nelement of proof does not erect the types of insurmountable barriers to meritorious\n\nclaims that the Tinchers portray: plaintiffs may adduce proof of existing products (i.e.,\n\npredecessor products or competitor products) or no expert proof at all if the feasibility of\n\nan alternative design is obvious and understandable to lay persons. Appellant’s Reply\n\nBrief at 20 (citing RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. f). Omega\n\nFlex presents the Third Restatement as a refinement of its predecessor with specific\n\nprovisions for design defects, whose approach has already been accepted in the form of\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 28\n\fnumerous exceptions to the general Second Restatement rules. Moreover, Omega\n\nFlex claims that, contrary to the Tinchers’ representations, adherence to the Second\n\nRestatement view has become the minority position. Omega Flex concludes that the\n\ncase should be retried before a jury properly instructed, and the instruction should be\n\npremised upon the Third Restatement.\n\n\n\n                                    III.   Analysis\n\n                      A.     The Scope and Standard of Review\n\n      As a preliminary matter, we observe that the parties pose and argue a seemingly\n\npristine question of law, little dependent on the facts of record, primarily regarding\n\nwhether this Court should replace the strict liability analysis of the Second Restatement\n\nwith the analysis of the Third Restatement. In part, this is a function of how the issues\n\nwere presented to the lower courts and of the lower courts’ recognition that the question\n\nof whether to “move” to the Third Restatement has been a matter of debate and\n\nspeculation in interested legal circles and in federal court cases (as well as in separate\n\nopinions in this Court); all recognize that, as a common law matter, the decision of\n\nwhether to adopt principles from the Third Restatement would ultimately be made by\n\nthis Court. As a result of this background circumstance, the lower courts offered no\n\nprincipled assessment or practical perspective regarding the core, and strictly legal,\n\npositions now presented by the parties to this Court. While the importance of lower\n\ncourts’ analysis of a proposed change in the law as applied to the facts of a particular\n\ncase and the centrality of such analysis to the development of the common law cannot\n\nbe understated, we note, nevertheless, that there is no suggestion by either party that\n\nthe issue so presented was waived.

Accordingly, we proceed to a\n\nreview of the merits of the parties’ dispute.\n\n       Properly framed, then, the question before the Court is whether Omega Flex was\n\nentitled to relief, in the form of judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial,\n\npremised upon its argument that the jury should have been instructed on the law\n\nrepresented by the Third Restatement. The relevant facts are not in dispute and the\n\nissue posed is one of law. Accordingly, our review of the Superior Court’s decision is\n\nplenary and de novo. Walnut Street Assocs., Inc. v.

A jury charge is adequate “unless the issues are\n\nnot made clear, the jury was misled by the instructions, or there was an omission from\n\nthe charge amounting to a fundamental error.” Commonwealth v.

An\n\naward of judgment notwithstanding the verdict “is appropriate only if, reading the record\n\nin the light most favorable to [the verdict winner], and affording [the verdict winner] the\n\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences, we would conclude that there is insufficient\n\ncompetent evidence to sustain the verdict.” General Services, 898 A.2d at 604.\n\n       The parties’ present dispute implicates foundational notions in the law of strict\n\nliability. To decide the dispute, we necessarily address: (1) what evidence is sufficient\n\nunder Pennsylvania law to prove a claim of strict liability in tort; (2) the proper role of the\n\ntrial judge; and (3) the appropriate manner of instructing the jury. As we will explain,\n\nthese questions can be further complicated by the particulars of the tort, or the product,\n\nat issue.\n\n       Furthermore, central to the parties’ dispute are questions of whether this Court\n\nshould disapprove the 1978 decision in Azzarello, and whether the Court should\n\nabandon the Second Restatement articulation of the strict liability cause of action and,\n\nin its place, “adopt” as the law of Pennsylvania the Third Restatement formulation of\n\nstrict liability in tort. These questions implicate separate foundational principles of stare\n\ndecisis and judicial restraint.\n\n       The doctrine of stare decisis “commands judicial respect for prior decisions of\n\nthis Court and the legal rules contained in those decisions.” Stilp, 905 A.2d at 954 n.31;\n\nsee also Kendrick v.

Notably, its\n\nequitable powers afford the Court the authority to modify the common law forms of\n\naction to the right involved, rather than limiting the authority to testing the right by the\n\nforms of action.

See\n\nalso PA. CONST. art.

No. 1001(b) (“There shall be a civil action in\n\nwhich “shall be brought all claims for relief heretofore asserted in (1) the action for\n\nassumpsit, (2) the action of trespass, and (3) the action in equity”).\n\n       Reliance upon the inherent and necessary flexibility of common law rules does\n\nnot provide, however, the dispositive answer to the question of whether “adoption” of\n\nthe American Law Institute’s new formulation for tort law is appropriate or advisable.\n\nThis Court has grown more careful over the years when presented with invitations to\n\nissue broad-based pronouncements in areas where it is apparent that such\n\npronouncements are better suited to the information-gathering and give-and-take\n\nbalancing of competing concerns available in the legislative arena. Thus, for example, it\n\nis difficult to imagine a modern court simply adopting something so broad-based and\n\nlegislative in character as an outside organization’s Restatement of the Law, even if it is\n\nthe product of an esteemed organization.         That being said, the fact is that, in this\n\nparticular area of the law, the Court has played a major developmental role; and when\n\nan issue is properly joined in a case, we are of course duty-bound to resolution and\n\nexplication of the matter. And, in this process, while the line of demarcation between\n\nadvancing or correcting the common law -- or, perhaps, accounting for nuance not\n\nadvanced, perceived, or predicted in the crucible of prior cases -- and a foray into\n\nlegislative policy-making is a gray area, some principles governing decision are readily\n\napparent.\n\n       The first principle applies generally and involves the policy-making authority of\n\nthe General Assembly. In considering whether a long-established common law rule is\n\nout of step with modern experience, we assume that the General Assembly is aware of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 33\n\fthe rule, which, if unchanged by legislation, presumably reflects continued legislative\n\npolicy.

Change is more often\n\ngradual because a court seldom is in possession of sufficient information concerning all\n\nrelevant factors to justify support of a rule of general application inconsistent with the\n\nexisting common law formulation of the tort.        See Official Comm. of Unsecured\n\nCreditors of Allegheny Health Educ. & Research Found. v.

Unlike the legislative process, the adjudicatory\n\nprocess is structured to cast a narrow focus on matters framed by litigants before the\n\nCourt in a highly directed fashion.” Id. Consistency with the general rule permits the\n\nCourt to benefit from the honed sensibilities and accumulated wisdom of the rule’s\n\napplication in a myriad of individual cases.\n\n       Two other considerations are specific to the nature and recognized role of a\n\n“Restatement” of law in the development of Pennsylvania common law. Restatements\n\nof law published by the American Law Institute purport to offer a synthesis of American\n\ncommon law, which articulates the reasoned, mainstream, modern consensus on\n\nprinciples of broad application intended to govern large numbers of cases.

In this sense, the adoption of a\n\nrestatement formulation intended to advance the law cannot be so unmoored from\n\nexisting common law and produce such a policy shift that it amounts in actuality or\n\npublic perception to a derogation of legislative authority, and the concomitant\n\nsuggestion that such authority is reposed in the Judiciary or in the American Law\n\nInstitute.   Consistent with this principle, the Court must generally show restraint in\n\n6\n       The Institute is a non-profit organization of 4000 lawyers, judges, and law\nprofessors, established to produce scholarly work to clarify, modernize, and otherwise\nimprove the law. Among other tasks, the Institute drafts, discusses, revises, and\npublishes Restatements of the Law.\n\n       The parties here, and several commentators, have engaged in a debate over\nwhether the Third Restatement of Torts, Products Liability, does indeed articulate the\nmodern consensus in the area of strict liability. Some commentators have questioned\nwhether the reporters of the Third Restatement favored an industry viewpoint in their\ntask. Compare Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 867 (reporters defend process of drafting\nThird Restatement) with John F. Vargo, THE EMPEROR’S NEW CLOTHES: THE AMERICAN\nLAW INSTITUTE ADORNS A “NEW CLOTH” FOR SECTION 402A PRODUCTS LIABILITY DESIGN\nDEFECTS -- A SURVEY OF THE STATES REVEALS A DIFFERENT W EAVE, 26 U. Mem. L. Rev.\n493 (1996) (criticizing drafting process of Third Restatement, surveying law in fifty\nstates, and cataloguing several approaches to strict liability). As an institution, this\nCourt is not particularly equipped to resolve such disputes, and in light of our\ndisposition, we find it unnecessary to engage the debate.

See City of Philadelphia, 81 A.3d at 55; accord Pegram v.

Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1385. As with any other common law rules, the\n\nnormative principles of an “adopted” section of a restatement are properly tested\n\nagainst the facts of each case. “For one thing, it is very difficult for courts to determine\n\nthe range of factual circumstances to which a particular rule should apply in light of the\n\noften myriad possibilities”; of particular concern is “the possibility that words or phrases\n\nor sentences may be taken out of context and treated as doctrines.” Maloney, 984 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 36\n\fat 489–90. In this regard, we underscore the importance of avoiding formulaic reading\n\nof common law principles and “wooden application of abstract principles to\n\ncircumstances in which different considerations may pertain.” Scampone, 57 A.3d at\n\n605 (citing Maloney, 984 A.2d at 485-86). Thus, as to any particular claim in a disputed\n\nmatter, a court should consider whether the application is logical and serves the\n\ninterests of justice, and whether the general principle has been accepted elsewhere.7\n\n“[T]he court always retains the right and the duty to test the reason behind a common\n\nlaw rule in determining the applicability of such rule to the facts before it. In the face of\n\ncontrary arguments as to why the rule should not apply in a given case, it is not enough\n\nto say merely that the rule as stated contains no exceptions.” Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1385.\n\nStated otherwise, “[w]here the facts of a case demonstrate that the rule outruns the\n\nreason, the court has the power, indeed the obligation, to refuse to apply the rule, a\n\npower for the most part unavailable where the rule is legislatively ordained.” Id.\n\n\n\n               B.

The evolution of strict liability jurisprudence has four\n\ndistinct, relevant periods: early cases addressing the evolution of strict liability and the\n\nadoption of the Second Restatement’s articulation of the cause of action; the advent of\n\nAzzarello; post-Azzarello jurisprudence; and recent judicial expressions addressing the\n\nThird Restatement.\n\n       At the outset, we note that disputes over liability for personal and economic harm\n\ncaused by products, although perhaps not articulated in those same terms, likely\n\naccompanied the earliest division of labor. Efficiency, specialization, and the evolution\n\nof expertise, separately and as precursors to invention and innovation, were significant\n\nbenefits of this division of labor.8    But, the same division of labor, especially in its\n\nincreasingly complex permutations, caused a physical and moral separation between\n\nsellers and buyers that inevitably generated disputes. The resolution of these disputes\n\nin English and American jurisdictions over the several centuries created a rich body of\n\nexperience-based common sensibilities and wisdom from which the modern principles\n\n\n8\n       David Hume said of the “partition of employments”:\n\n                     When every individual person labours a-part, and only\n              for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable\n              work; his labour being employ’d in supplying all his different\n              necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular\n              art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal,\n              the least failure in either of these particulars must be\n              attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a\n              remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction\n              of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of\n              employments, our ability [in]creases: And by mutual succor\n              we are less expos’d to fortune and accidents. ’Tis by this\n              additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes\n              advantageous.\n\nDavid Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature (1739).\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 38\n\fof the common law of products liability evolved.

Redress for injury caused\n\nby   other   products   was    available      in    tort    (by   asserting,   e.g.,   negligence,\n\nmisrepresentation, or fraud claims) or by asserting breach of warranty claims. These\n\ncauses of action, and their attendant respective forms of pleading, remain available to\n\nplaintiffs today, forming the greater body of products liability law. Accord Lance, 85\n\nA.3d at 440 n.8.\n\n       By the 1960s, plaintiffs had sought to establish liability of sellers of products\n\nprimarily via actions in negligence and breach of warranty, on the assumption that these\n\nrecognized causes of action provided the best approximation of justice in individual\n\ncases then available. Negligence, in tort, spoke to the notion of redress for a legal\n\nwrong or direct and forcible injury to the person, land, or chattels of another. See R.F.V.\n\nHeuston, SALMOND    ON THE    LAW   OF   TORTS 4 (17th ed. 1977). Negligence theory also\n\noffered the convenience that it did not require proof of knowledge of a particular defect\n\nin the product, but simply the failure to exercise due care had the defect been\n\nforeseeable. Meanwhile, a breach of warranty action, sounding in assumpsit, was at its\n\norigin an action in tort, which “transformed into an action of contract, becoming\n\nafterwards a remedy where there was neither tort nor contract.” James Barr Ames, The\n\nHistory of Assumpsit in 3 SELECT ESSAYS            IN   ANGLO-AMERICAN LEGAL HISTORY 1, 298\n\n(1909). The word assumpsit suggested the making of a promise and, originally, the\n\nactionable conduct was the breach of an express promise.                   The cause of action\n\nevolved, however, to encompass the breach of an implied promise, and even of a\n\nfictitious promise. See id. (commenting upon “assumpsit” as illustration of “the flexibility\n\nand power of self-development of the Common Law”). “[W]arranty (unlike negligence\n\n\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 41\n\fwhich is a tort concept based on fault) is not a concept based on fault or on the failure to\n\nexercise reasonable care.       But this does not mean that warranty is necessarily\n\ncontractual or non-tortious in nature.     Liability in warranty arises where damage is\n\ncaused by the failure of a product to measure up to express or implied representations\n\non the part of the manufacturer or other supplier.

Elements of both the negligence and breach of warranty causes of action, as they\n\nhad thus developed, foreshadowed the evolution of jurisprudence in the area of strict\n\nliability, and increasingly resonated with courts.\n\n\n\n                 1.     The Second Restatement and the Early Cases\n\n       Early decisional law in Pennsylvania explained the genesis and nature of the\n\nstrict liability cause of action, with reference to Section 402A of the Second\n\nRestatement. Section 402A of the Second Restatement states:\n\n                    § 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for\n              Physical Harm to User or Consumer\n\n                     (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition\n              unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his\n              property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby\n              caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\n                     (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling\n              such a product, and\n                     (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or\n              consumer without substantial change in the condition in\n              which it is sold.\n\n                    (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although\n                    (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the\n              preparation and sale of his product, and\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 42\n\f                     (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product\n               from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A (1965).\n\n        The commentary to the Second Restatement traces the roots of the higher\n\ndegree of responsibility placed upon sellers of goods to English criminal statutes of the\n\nThirteenth Century that imposed penalties upon persons who supplied “corrupt food and\n\ndrink.” RESTATEMENT (2D)     OF   TORTS § 402A cmt. b. As these criminal statutes were\n\nrepealed, judicial decisions referred in dicta to the civil liability of sellers to those to\n\nwhom they sold “corrupt victuals.” See Prosser, 69 Yale L.J. at 1104. Early American\n\njurisprudence denominated the special civil responsibility as “warranty,” imposed upon\n\nthe seller of food in favor of the direct purchaser. At the beginning of the Twentieth\n\nCentury, judicial decisions extended sellers’ “strict liability” beyond the direct purchaser\n\nto injured consumers. Id. The decisions articulated an exception to the general rule of\n\nmore direct liability premised upon proof of negligence or privity of contract. “In the\n\nbeginning, these decisions displayed considerable ingenuity in evolving more or less\n\nfictitious theories of liability to fit the case. The various devices included an agency of\n\nthe intermediate dealer or another to purchase for the consumer, or to sell for the seller;\n\na theoretical assignment of the seller’s warranty to the intermediate dealer; a third party\n\nbeneficiary contract; and an implied representation that the food was fit for consumption\n\nbecause it was placed on the market, as well as numerous others.” RESTATEMENT (2D)\n\nOF   TORTS § 402A cmt. b. Later jurisprudence settled upon a theory of warranty “running\n\nwith the goods” or made directly to the consumer; the alternative was strict liability in\n\ntort. After 1950, jurisdictions extended the rule of strict liability beyond the sale of food\n\nfor human consumption, to other products intended for intimate bodily use. Finally, in\n\nthe late 1950s, courts began applying these developed rules of strict liability to the sale\n\nof any product.

In\n\nWebb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court vacated the trial court’s order to dismiss the case and\n\nremanded with instructions for the trial court to permit the plaintiff to amend his\n\ncomplaint to add a cause of action premised upon the theory of strict liability in tort as\n\narticulated by the Second Restatement. The plaintiff in Webb had been severely injured\n\nwhen a beer keg exploded and, as a result, filed a complaint “in trespass,” asserting an\n\n“exclusive control” theory of negligence -- essentially res ipsa loquitur, see, e.g., Loch v.\n\nConfair, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1953) -- against the beer distributor, the brewer who had filled\n\nthe keg, and the manufacturer of the keg.           The trial court sustained preliminary\n\nobjections, reasoning that the plaintiff had not joined in the suit before the expiration of\n\nthe statute of limitations all parties against whom an inference of negligence could be\n\ndrawn, i.e., the plaintiff’s father, who had purchased the keg, and the plaintiff’s brother,\n\nwho had tapped the keg.

The relevant reasoning of the Webb Court in its entirety reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n                       We need not, however, determine whether or not the\n              lower court erred with regard to the law of exclusive control,\n              for there is another and clearer issue which is determinative\n              of this appeal. That issue is the nature and scope of the\n              liability in trespass of one who produces or markets a\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 44\n\f              defective product for use or consumption. The development\n              of the law in that area is chronicled in the Concurring and\n              Dissenting Opinions of Justices Jones and Roberts to the\n              decision of this Court in Miller v.

One will also find there citations to modern case law\n              and commentaries which extend and recommend the\n              extension of the law of strict liability in tort for defective\n              products. The new Restatement of Torts reflects this\n              modern attitude. Section 402A thereof states: [Quoting in\n              full Section 402A of the Second Restatement.]\n\n                    We hereby adopt the foregoing language as the law\n              of Pennsylvania.\n\n                    The plaintiff in this litigation, therefore, must be given\n              an opportunity to plead and prove his case. . . .\n220 A.2d at 854.     Mr. Justice Eagen filed a joining concurring opinion, noting his\n\npreference for a limited application of the Second Restatement. Mr. Chief Justice Bell\n\nfiled a dissenting opinion. See n.10 infra.\n\n       The several opinions filed in Miller offer substantially more insight than Webb into\n\nthe genesis of the strict liability tort in Pennsylvania and the Court’s decision to adopt\n\nthe Second Restatement to define its parameters. The Miller plaintiff was the estate\n\nadministrator of a deceased infant, who was fatally injured when a vaporizer-humidifier\n\nused to relieve congestion in his nose shot boiling water on his body. The plaintiff filed\n\na complaint asserting a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability against the\n\nmanufacturer, the distributor, and the retail pharmacy that had sold the vaporizer-\n\nhumidifier to the deceased infant’s aunt. The infant had used the product in the aunt’s\n\nhome, next door to his family’s home.         In relevant part, the trial court sustained\n\npreliminary objections to the complaint, on the ground that the implied warranty did not\n\nextend to the deceased infant because he had not been in privity of contract with any of\n\nthe defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 45\n\f       The Miller Court reversed the judgment as a matter of law entered in favor of a\n\nretailer because the deceased infant, who was harmed by the vaporizer-humidifier sold\n\nby the retailer, was “in the buyer’s family” and, notwithstanding the infant’s lack of privity\n\nwith the retailer, his representative had met the prerequisites for pursuing a breach of\n\nwarranty action under the plain language of the Uniform Commercial Code.                  (By\n\ncomparison, the Webb plaintiff had pursued an action in tort on a theory of negligence.)\n\nAdditionally, the Miller Court affirmed the judgment in favor of the manufacturer and of\n\nthe distributor, reasoning that the Code’s provisions did not extend warranty liability to\n\nremote sellers in the chain of distribution. Id. at 324 (citing 12A P.S. § 2-318). In both\n\nrespects, according to the Court, the language of the Uniform Commercial Code was\n\ndispositive. The Miller Court viewed abandoning the requirement of privity in warranty\n\nactions as unnecessary, noting the expectation that strict liability in tort would vindicate\n\npublic policy relating to products liability and accomplished a similar result to\n\nabandoning privity.\n\n       Justice Jones concurred in the decision to reverse the judgment against the\n\nretailer, but dissented from the Court’s disposition with respect to the manufacturer and\n\ndistributor of the product. The dissent was premised in part upon the view that, if the\n\nCourt retained the requirement of privity, the Court should adopt the Second\n\nRestatement and thereby relegate all actions in the products liability field to tort. The\n\ndissent described the state of the law then existing:\n\n                     In the field of product liability, resort for redress for\n              injury arising from a defective product may be had either in\n              tort or assumpsit. In [Loch v. Confair, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.\n              1949)], we said “that a person who has effected the\n              purchase of particular goods and sustains injury because of\n              unfitness for an intended purpose may institute an action in\n              assumpsit based upon a breach of implied warranty Or an\n              action in trespass based upon specific averments of\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 46\n\f             negligence. In both instances the elements of damage may\n             be identical, viz, the damage naturally and proximately\n             resulting from a breach of implied warranty or a breach of\n             duty. . . . An election of remedies in this regard has,\n             however, never been held by this Court to authorize\n             institution of a contract action based upon averments of\n             negligence. Nor, conversely, has it authorized institution of a\n             negligence action based upon averments of contract.\n             Essential distinctions which exist have been recognized.”\n             [63 A.2d at 26]. Thus, while a person injured by a defective\n             product has an election of remedies, however, each remedy\n             has acquired distinct characteristics.\n221 A.2d at 329 (Jones, J., concurring and dissenting) (footnote omitted).\n\n      Justice Jones then expressed support for the approach of the Second\n\nRestatement whose purpose, he stated, was to ensure “that the costs of injuries\n\nresulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products\n\non the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect\n\nthemselves.” Id. at 334.\n\n      According to Justice Jones, the judgments that would result from application of\n\nthe Second Restatement were “not a far cry” from the doctrines of res ipsa loquitur and\n\nof exclusive control.   The dissent viewed manufacturers and sellers, proximate or\n\nremote, of products for consumption by the public as subject “to a special responsibility\n\nto any member of the using and consuming public who may be injured by the use and\n\nconsumption of the product.”     The dissent reasoned that the public expects such\n\nmanufacturers and sellers to stand behind their products; therefore, the financial burden\n\nof injuries caused by defective products “should fall upon those who make and market\n\nthe products and the consuming public is entitled to the maximum protection.” Id. at\n\n334-35.\n\n      In his dissent, Justice Roberts, joined by Mr. Justice Musmanno, would also have\n\nreversed the summary judgment entered by the trial court as to all defendants. These\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 47\n\fdissenters reasoned that the majority’s decision elevated form over substance, and they\n\nwould have allowed the cause of action in the matter to proceed either in assumpsit, on\n\nthe basis of a breach of warranty, or in trespass, on the basis of strict liability. In this\n\nregard, the dissent suggested that the same results would obtain whether a plaintiff\n\nchose to pursue his products liability claim on a breach of warranty theory or under the\n\nSecond Restatement.\n\n       The dissenters remarked that the duty of sellers of products for human\n\nconsumption “extended beyond the mere avoidance of negligence,” and had been\n\ncharacterized as a “special responsibility . . . in the nature of an implied warranty that\n\nsuch products would be fit for human consumption. . . .” The duty had been limited to\n\nthe immediate buyer; but, the dissent noted, courts “recognized the injustice inherent in\n\nsuch a limitation” and had developed theories of strict liability in defective food cases.\n\nAt the same time, according to the dissent, the privity requirement was not eliminated as\n\nto non-food products, which presented equal dangers. The dissenters questioned the\n\nmerit of that distinction. From a practical perspective, the dissent also noted that the\n\ndoctrine of privity did not insulate defendants from liability because an action by a\n\nconsumer against a seller simply started a chain reaction of indemnity; “[a]ll that is really\n\naccomplished by the restriction [of privity] is to expose [the] plaintiff to the risk that the\n\nretail seller may not be financially able to make redress and to deprive [the plaintiff] of\n\nthe opportunity of proceeding directly against the more financially able parties in the\n\ndistributive chain.” 221 A.2d at 336-38.\n\n       The dissent then expressed its disapproval of the “conceptual abstractions and\n\nniceties of pleading” that had obscured what it believed was essentially a strict liability\n\ncause of action and the considerations that supported it, and encouraged the Court to\n\nadopt the Second Restatement. In the dissent’s view:\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 48\n\f                      The public interest in affording the maximum\n             protection possible under the law to human life, health and\n             safety; the inability of the consumer to protect himself; the\n             seller’s implied assurance of the safety of a product on the\n             open market; the superior ability of the manufacturer or\n             seller to distribute the risk of loss; the needless circuity of\n             recovery and the expensive, time consuming, wasteful and\n             often unjust process which insistence upon privity frequently\n             occasions -- all support the extension of the protection of\n             strict liability beyond the food cases to those involving other\n             consumer goods as well.\n221 A.2d at 338-39.\n\n      Thus, the 6 to 1 Webb decision itself contained no developed majority\n\nexpression, despite the important transitional point it marked in Pennsylvania law.10\n\n      The commentary to the Second Restatement and the Court’s decisional law over\n\nthe subsequent decade reflect early foundational debates among members of the Court\n\nconcerning the tort.11 In a series of cases, the Court addressed narrow applications of\n\nbroader questions relating to burdens of proof, evidence, and jury instructions in strict\n\n10\n        In Webb, Chief Justice Bell dissented, premised primarily upon the argument that\nthe majority was overruling numerous decisions sub silentio in favor of a “new rule . . .\n[that] so completely changes, not by legislative action but by judicial ukase, the law with\nrespect to trespass actions for injuries resulting from non-inherently dangerous products\nthat are either manufactured or bottled or sold by any vendor . . . that in [the Chief\nJustice’s] opinion it is not only very unfair but absolutely Unjustifiable in Justice or in\nLaw.” 220 A.2d at 855 (Bell, C.J., dissenting).\n\n11\n       In the interim, the Court addressed several corollary matters, without offering any\ninsight into foundational matters of concern here.

The Court\n\nreasoned that for liability to attach per Section 402A, “the seller need only sell a\n\ndefective product [and need not] have caused the defect.” The Court added that the\n\ntrial court should instruct the jury that a plaintiff “is not required to prove that the\n\ndefendants were negligent, that the defendants can be held liable even if they exercised\n\nall possible care and that no consideration should be given to negligence.” But, the\n\nCourt explained, sellers in a distributive chain who precede a seller that caused the\n\ndefect do not sell a defective product and are not liable. In this sense, according to the\n\nCourt, the plaintiff’s theory of the case is relevant and the trial court has discretion to\n\ntailor the charge to reflect the evidence and theories of the parties.

The plaintiff proceeded on theories of negligence and strict liability in the\n\ndesign and manufacture of the brake locking mechanism. At the close of evidence, the\n\ntrial court granted summary relief to the manufacturer on the negligence claim and\n\nsubmitted the strict liability claims to the jury; the jury was dismissed when it could not\n\nagree on a verdict. Subsequently, the trial court granted the manufacturer’s motion for\n\njudgment on the record.     On appeal, this Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and\n\nawarded the plaintiff a new trial.     Justice Pomeroy’s OAJC reasoned that evidence\n\nrelating to the accident, in addition to the occurrence of five similar malfunctions of the\n\nlocking mechanism, was sufficient to show that the product was defective, even absent\n\ndirect evidence of a specific defect. According to the OAJC, in the absence of other\n\nidentifiable causes, the malfunction itself was evidence of a defective condition; “[t]his\n\nrule reflects the fact that liability under [Section] 402A turns on a lack of fitness in the\n\ndefendant’s product, as in the case of an action for breach of warranty, rather than on\n\nthe breach of a particular duty of care by the defendant, as in the case of an action for\n\nnegligence.” The OAJC continued: “[w]hile a plaintiff’s hand in a strict liability case will\n\nobviously be strengthened by evidence of a specific defect in the defendant’s product\n\nsuch evidence is not necessary to take . . . the plaintiff’s case to a jury.” Id. at 920.\n\n       Finally, the OAJC commented upon the relevance of proof that the crane\n\noperator had left the controls while the pipe was suspended. According to the OAJC,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 51\n\fthe operator’s alleged negligence was legally significant as a potential superseding\n\ncause of the plaintiff’s injuries. Kuisis, 319 A.2d at 920; see also Rogers, 565 A.2d at\n\n755. But, the opinion continued, operator negligence was not a superseding cause of\n\nthe plaintiff’s injuries unless the negligent conduct was outside the manufacturer’s\n\n“reasonable range of foreseeability.”       Justice Pomeroy opined that the principle of\n\nforeseeability “carries over from traditional negligence law to strict liability cases. . . . It\n\nmakes no difference in this regard whether the operator’s conduct is characterized as\n\nan intervening act of negligence or as an ‘abnormal use’ of the crane; where under\n\n[Section] 402A a particular use of a product is abnormal depends on whether the use\n\nwas reasonably foreseeable by the seller.” Kuisis, 319 A.2d at 920-21 & n.13. Other\n\nproof relevant to the question of foreseeability, the OAJC added, was the passage of\n\ntwenty years since the crane had been manufactured and any interim alterations. Id. at\n\n922 & n.15.12\n\n       Following the decision in Kuisis, the Court revisited questions relating both to a\n\nplaintiff’s burden of proving a strict liability claim, and relevant jury instructions, in\n\n12\n       In parallel developments, the Court dispensed with privity prerequisites for stating\na breach of an implied warranty claim, by reference to the Second Restatement.

The Court affirmed by unanimous mandate the decision of the\n\nSuperior Court to reverse the judgment on the verdict granted to the defendant and to\n\naward the plaintiff a new (third) trial. The decision generated several opinions, among\n\nthem the OAJC of Chief Justice Jones, joined by Justice Nix, parts of which later\n\nbecame law in Azzarello. See 391 A.2d at 1027 and discussion infra. Justices Roberts\n\nand Pomeroy filed separate concurring opinions, while Justices Eagen, O’Brien, and\n\nManderino concurred in the result without opinion.\n\n       The Berkebile OAJC commenced its analysis by noting the necessity “to clarify\n\nthe concepts of strict liability in Pennsylvania,” so as to avoid further confusion in the\n\ncase upon remand for a third trial. In concurring, Justices Roberts and Pomeroy would\n\nhave decided the matter on the separate issue of strict liability for a failure to warn. 337\n\nA.2d at 903-04.\n\n       In Berkebile, following the death of her husband in a helicopter crash, the\n\nadministratrix of the estate sued the manufacturer, premised upon theories of strict\n\nliability for defective design of the helicopter’s rotor system, for defective manufacturing\n\nand design of the rotor blade, for inadequate warnings regarding the inherent risks and\n\nlimitations of the rotor system, and for misrepresentation of the helicopter’s safety in the\n\nmanufacturer’s advertising brochures. The defendant denied the existence of a defect\n\nand argued that the decedent’s abnormal use had caused the crash.\n\n       The Berkebile OAJC reiterated that strict liability, as a cause of action,\n\nimplemented a policy of consumer protection. According to the OAJC, “[t]he increasing\n\ncomplexity of the manufacturing and distributional process placed upon the injured\n\nplaintiff a nearly impossible burden of proving negligence where, for policy reasons, it\n\nwas felt that a seller should be responsible for injuries caused by defects in his\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 53\n\fproducts.” Id. at 898 (citing RESTATEMENT (2D)      OF     TORTS § 402A cmt. c). The OAJC\n\nexplained that, in a strict liability matter, proof of a seller’s due care and breach of due\n\ncare are unnecessary because liability attaches “without fault.” Id. (citing Salvador, 319\n\nA.2d at 907). Instead, to recover, a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective,\n\nand that the defect was a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.          In addition,\n\naccording to the OAJC, the plaintiff has the burden to prove that the defect causing the\n\ninjury existed at the time that the product left the seller’s hands. The OAJC then warned\n\nof attempts by a defendant-seller at “indirectly . . . injecting negligence concepts into\n\nstrict liability theory.” Id. at 899.\n\n       The Berkebile OAJC also parsed the language of the Second Restatement,\n\nopining that the Restatement imposes a seemingly contradictory burden of proving that\n\na “defect” is “unreasonably dangerous.” According to the OAJC, the standards are\n\nreconcilable if the purpose of the “unreasonably dangerous” qualification is “to\n\ndifferentiate those products which are by their very nature unsafe but not defective from\n\nthose which can truly be called defective.” The OAJC rejected the notion that defect\n\nshould be defined based upon the negligence-oriented reasonable man concept, which\n\ntended to dilute the strict liability concept, and offered that the “unreasonably dangerous\n\nclause” should be included in articulating the issue of proximate cause to the jury. Chief\n\nJustice Jones explained that the result of limiting the liability of a seller premised upon a\n\n“reasonable man” standard, which the clause “unreasonably dangerous” could suggest,\n\nprotects the seller from becoming “an insurer of his products with respect to all harm\n\ngenerated by their use.” But, such standard would also require an injured consumer-\n\nplaintiff to prove an element of negligence, which means in practice that, regardless of\n\nthe injured consumer’s expectations regarding the product, the injured consumer would\n\nbe unable to recover if an “ordinary consumer” would have expected the product’s\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-80-2013] - 54\n\fdefective condition. Chief Justice Jones opined that it is unnecessary to place the\n\nadditional burden upon the injured consumer to limit a seller’s liability because the seller\n\nis adequately protected “by the necessity of proving that there was a defect in the\n\nmanufacture or design of the product, and that such defect was a proximate cause of\n\nthe injuries.” Id. at 899-900 (quoting Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1180351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1180351/cronin-v-jbe-olson-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1161\n\n(Cal. 1972), whose holding we address infra). As a result, the OAJC concluded that the\n\njury should not be instructed as to the reasonable man standard or reasonableness “in\n\nany form.” Id. at 900.\n\n       Chief Justice Jones added that proof of strict liability is not premised upon\n\nwhether the seller could have foreseen a particular injury, for to articulate the burden of\n\nproof in terms of foreseeability is to require the plaintiff to prove that the seller exercised\n\ndue care. But, because the seller is liable in strict liability regardless of any negligence,\n\nwhether the seller could have foreseen a particular injury is irrelevant. Once a product\n\nis proved defective, the seller is responsible for all the unforeseen harm it caused, no\n\nmatter how remote. Moreover, Chief Justice Jones reasoned, a plaintiff’s negligence\n\ndoes not bar recovery in strict liability, although evidence that would tend to prove such\n\nnegligence may be relevant for the purpose of rebutting the plaintiff’s contentions of\n\ndefect and proximate cause. Id. at 901.\n\n       Finally, the Berkebile OAJC addressed the viability of the plaintiff’s failure to warn\n\nclaims, reasoning that the trial court had erred in failing to charge the jury on the point.\n\nChief Justice Jones stated: “A ‘defective condition’ is not limited to defects in design or\n\nmanufacture. The seller must provide with the product every element necessary\n\nto make it safe for use.       One such element may be warnings and/or instructions\n\nconcerning use of the product. A seller must give such warning and instructions as are\n\nrequired to inform the user or consumer of the possible risks and inherent limitations of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 55\n\fhis product.” Id. at 902 (emphasis added) (citing RESTATEMENT (2D)      OF   TORTS § 402A\n\ncmt. c).    The portion of the Berkebile lead opinion emphasized above was quoted\n\nsubsequently out of context by the majority in Azzarello as the standard of proof in a\n\nstrict liability action.\n\n        Looking back, it is now apparent that the first decade of applying the doctrine of\n\nstrict liability in Pennsylvania offered a series of missed opportunities to develop a\n\nvibrant and coherent body of common law on the issue. The difficulties arose from the\n\nhappenstance of the idiosyncratic procedural postures of cases in which the Court\n\nnevertheless apparently sought to make conceptual advances in the arena. To start,\n\nthe Webb Court “adopted” the Second Restatement and remanded the case to the trial\n\ncourt for application, without offering much explanation of either how Section 402A\n\nderived from or complemented existing common law, or direction concerning its\n\napplication by the lower courts, including the realm of jury charges. The procedural\n\nposture of Webb -- an appeal from a trial court decision sustaining preliminary\n\nobjections -- and some consensus regarding the direction of the law, perhaps explain\n\nthe approach. The concurring and dissenting expressions in Miller, upon which the\n\nWebb Court relied, offered a more reasoned explanation for the availability of strict\n\nliability in tort as a separate cause of action and attenuated, to a degree, the stark\n\napproach of the summary Webb majority decision. But, the responsive expressions --\n\noffered in the context of a breach of warranty case no less -- suggested little in terms of\n\nan explication of essential foundational concepts or practical application, which are\n\ngenerally the sine qua non of common law decisions.\n\n        And so, much like the Second Restatement articulation of strict liability,\n\nPennsylvania decisional law did not speak affirmatively to the plaintiff’s burden of proof\n\nin strict liability cases but addressed it by negation, i.e., as compared to then-more\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 56\n\ffamiliar theories of breach of warranty initially and, later, negligence. In the subsequent\n\ndecade, foundational issues regarding the strict liability in tort cause of action did not\n\nreach the Supreme Court or, when questions were presented, expressions failed to\n\ncommand clear majority support.        To the extent that the Court spoke to broader\n\nconsiderations, several trends became evident: the original prominence of warranty-\n\nrelated attempts to limit application of strict liability theory decreased, and the relevance\n\nof negligence-related encroachments commenced its ascent; rhetoric emerged not only\n\nto distinguish strict liability from its negligence roots, but also to excise negligence\n\nprinciples and terms (such as foreseeability) from strict liability theory; the reliance upon\n\nformulaic reiteration of consumer protection-related policies, offered as a bulwark\n\nagainst attempts to dilute the application of strict liability theory in individual cases; and\n\nthen a focus in strict liability theory that ultimately turned upon a statutory construction-\n\ntype of analysis of the Second Restatement. Experience suggests that these trends,\n\nand fits and starts, have proven antithetical to the orderly evolution of our decisional\n\nlaw, one that must be responsive to new problems, perspectives, and consequences.\n\n\n\n                                      2.     Azzarello\n\n       In 1978, the Court was confronted with the question of whether the trial court had\n\nadequately charged a jury on the law of products liability in Pennsylvania.              The\n\nAzzarello plaintiff had been injured when he pinched his hand between two hard rubber\n\nrolls in a coating machine manufactured by Black Brothers Company.               The plaintiff\n\nproceeded on a theory of strict liability against the manufacturer, but the manufacturer\n\nalso joined the plaintiff’s employer as a co-defendant, asserting that the employer’s\n\nnegligence was the sole or contributing cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. See Azzarello,\n\n391 A.2d at 1022. In a unanimous opinion, the Court held that the jury charge issued by\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 57\n\fthe trial court was misleading and affirmed the decision of the Superior Court, which had\n\ngranted the plaintiff a new trial. The Azzarello Court approved an alternative charge.\n\nId. at 1027 n.12.\n\n       The Court addressed two related and important questions: whether a\n\ndetermination as to the risk of loss in a strict liability case is a decision for the judge or\n\nthe jury, and whether the words “unreasonably dangerous” have any place in the strict\n\nliability jury instruction. The Court concluded that the words “unreasonably dangerous”\n\nexplain the term “defective” but have “no independent significance and merely represent\n\na label to be used where it is determined that the risk of loss should be placed upon the\n\nsupplier.” The words “unreasonably dangerous” limit liability and signal that a seller is\n\nnot an insurer but a guarantor of the product. However, the difficulty with the use of the\n\nterm in jury instructions, the Court reasoned, was that it signaled to the jury that the\n\nconsumer has the burden to prove an element of negligence. According to the Court, in\n\nstrict liability cases, burdening a plaintiff with proof of negligence is unwarranted; the\n\nseller’s liability is limited “by the necessity of proving that there was a defect in the\n\nmanufacture or design of the product, and that such defect was a (legal) cause of the\n\ninjuries.” Id. at 1025 (quoting Cronin, 501 P.2d at 1161-62); see also Berkebile, 337\n\nA.2d at 899-900.\n\n       The Azzarello Court further reasoned that a change in terminology to avoid\n\nreferences to negligence principles would be insufficient to articulate instructions\n\nappropriate for a lay jury. Indeed, according to the Court, the formulation of the Second\n\nRestatement was not intended to articulate jury instructions but employed principles\n\ndesigned instead to predict responsibility and to guide the professional bench and bar.\n\nThe Court then concluded that the best means to implement the principles of the\n\nSecond Restatement was to direct: (1) that the phrases “defective condition” and\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 58\n\f“unreasonably dangerous,” which predict whether recovery would be justified, are\n\nissues of law and policy entrusted solely for decision to the trial court; and (2) that the\n\ninquiry into whether a plaintiff has proven the factual allegations in the complaint is a\n\nquestion for the jury. According to the Court, in cases of an alleged defective design,\n\nthe dispositive question is whether the product is safe for its intended use. The Court\n\nemphasized that the seller is the “guarantor” of the product, and a jury could find a\n\ndefect “where the product left the supplier’s control lacking any element necessary to\n\nmake it safe for its intended use or possessing any feature that renders it unsafe for the\n\nintended use.” Id. at 1027 (citing Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 902). Having concluded that\n\nthe jury should not be instructed on the “unreasonably dangerous” standard, the Court\n\nthen affirmed the Superior Court’s decision to remand the case to the trial court for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n\n\n                  3.      Post-Azzarello Design Defect Jurisprudence\n\n       Following Azzarello, decisional focus in strict liability cases shifted to reflect an\n\nincreasing concern with segregating strict liability and negligence concepts. The Court\n\naddressed several evidentiary questions, in the process touching upon foundational\n\nnotions of strict liability relevant to a design defect claim.13\n\n\n13\n        The jurisprudence of strict liability for failure to warn also developed in parallel.\nSee, e.g., Sherk v.

The plaintiff had injured his legs when he accidentally depressed the control\n\nbuttons, which caused the hoist to swing its load into his body. The Court rejected the\n\ndefendant’s claim that the trial court erred in excluding expert testimony relating to\n\nindustry standards and practices, e.g., that ninety percent of similar hoists lacked a\n\nguard around the control panel and that a nationwide trade group had certified the\n\nproduct design as safe.\n\n       Before addressing whether particular expert testimony was relevant to a strict\n\nliability cause of action, the Lewis Court set out its view of the applicable substantive\n\nlaw. The Court noted that strict liability in tort was a cause of action available when an\n\ninjury is caused by a defect in design.

The Court noted a\n\n“consumer expectations” approach, which is an inquiry into whether the product “failed\n\nto perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended\n\nor reasonably foreseeable manner.” Id. at 593 (citing Barker v. Lull Engineering Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1166422\"><a href=\"/opinion/1166422/barker-v-lull-engineering-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1978)).      A second accepted approach, according to the Court,\n\ninvolves “risk-utility” balancing.   Id. (citing Barker, supra, and A. Weinstein et al,\n\nPRODUCTS LIABILITY AND THE REASONABLY SAFE PRODUCT, at 43-59 (1978)). However, in\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\nease of removing safety device, warning on blender sufficient to caution operator\nagainst conduct that caused injury).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 60\n\fPennsylvania, the Court explained, Azzarello articulated a distinct approach: “the jury\n\nmay find a defect where the product left the supplier’s control lacking any element\n\nnecessary to make it safe for its intended use or possessing any feature that renders it\n\nunsafe for the intended use.” Id. (citing Azzarello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956643\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956643/com-v-kingsley/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\n\n       The Lewis Court observed that jurisdictions with various approaches agreed that\n\nrelevant at trial is the condition of the product rather than the reasonableness of the\n\nmanufacturer’s conduct. As a result, the Court concluded, a strict liability claim does not\n\nsound in negligence -- a proposition in harmony with the Azzarello decision. The Court\n\nheld that, because “due care” has no bearing upon liability in a strict liability case, proof\n\nof industry standards -- which go to a negligence concept of reasonable care -- are\n\nirrelevant and “created a strong likelihood of diverting the jury’s attention from [the\n\nproduct] to the reasonableness of the [manufacturer-defendant’s] conduct in choosing\n\nits design.” Id. at 593-94.\n\n       Mr. Justice Larsen concurred, adding that because of their “inherently self-\n\nserving nature,” admission of industry standards evidence would be highly prejudicial to\n\nthe consumer. In a dissent, Mr. Justice Flaherty criticized the majority’s approach to\n\nstrict liability claims, noting that evidence of injury alone is insufficient to prove a strict\n\nliability claim; rather, industry standards are relevant to the question of defect. This is\n\nso, the dissent said, because suppliers are liable only if an unsafe product is placed on\n\nthe market: strict liability “does not impose liability for failing to make an already safe\n\nproduct somewhat safer, or for failing to utilize the safest of all possible designs. We\n\nare simply not dealing with conceptual Platonic ideals of perfection when a jury\n\nconsiders whether any given product is safe.” Id. at 595. In a separate dissent, Mr.\n\nJustice Hutchinson, also joined by Justice Flaherty, opined that industry standards are\n\nwritten by specialized individuals with knowledge of product design superior to that of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 61\n\fcourts and, as a result, evidence of such standards is relevant to the question of defect.\n\nJustices Flaherty and Hutchinson concluded that evidence of industry standards was\n\nadmissible although not necessarily highly probative.\n\n       Later, in Kimco Development Corporation v. Michael D’s Carpet Outlets, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1993), the Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court, and held\n\nthat the comparative negligence of a co-defendant is not a basis upon which to\n\ndecrease the amount of damages available premised upon a strict liability claim. In\n\nKimco, a shopping center owner and several tenants sued the manufacturer of\n\npolyurethane foam carpet padding, which caught fire and damaged the shopping center,\n\nas well as the tenant in whose store the fire broke out; the tenant-defendant\n\ncountersued the manufacturer and shopping center owner. The parties asserted claims\n\nof negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability in tort. The jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of the plaintiffs on theories of strict liability and negligence, apportioning\n\nnegligence responsibility 80/20 to the tenant-defendant and manufacturer, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the jury found in favor of the tenant-defendant and against the manufacturer\n\non a strict liability theory.   The trial court denied a motion to reduce the tenant-\n\ndefendant’s strict liability verdict against the manufacturer premised upon the\n\napportionment of responsibility in negligence. The Superior Court affirmed.\n\n       On appeal, this Court rejected the manufacturer’s argument that comparative\n\nnegligence is a defense to a claim in strict liability. Initially, the Court noted that “[t]he\n\nlaw amongst the various states is in considerable disarray on the point in question.”\n\nThe Court then reasoned that applying contributory negligence principles to strict liability\n\nclaims would cause “conceptual confusion” and would undermine the purpose of strict\n\nliability: “[t]hroughout the development of [Section] 402A liability, we have been\n\nadamant that negligence concepts have no place in a strict liability action.” Id. at 605-\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 62\n\f06 (citing Azzarello, McCown, and Berkebile). According to the Court, in strict liability,\n\n“the focus is on the nature of the product and the consumer’s reasonable expectations\n\nwith regard to the product, rather than upon the conduct of either the manufacturer or\n\nthe person injured.” The Court concluded that permitting recoveries to be reduced\n\npremised on negligence concepts would weaken the deterrent effect of the policy to\n\nprotect the consumer and to shift the risk of loss to the supplier of the defective product\n\n“without regard to fault or privity of contract.”       Id. at 605-07.14   Justice Flaherty\n\ndissented, premised upon the argument that strict liability without regard to\n\nproportionate faults burdened business enterprises with liabilities that worked serious\n\ndetriment to the economy.\n\n\n\n                   4.     Recent Cases and the Third Restatement\n\n      In 1998, the ALI proposed a new restatement of the law relating specifically to\n\nproducts liability. See RESTATEMENT (3D)   OF   TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY §§ 1-8 (1998)\n\n(Liability Rules Applicable to Products Generally). As is evident from the premise of this\n\nlitigation, this Court has not yet determined whether to adopt the formulation of the Third\n\nRestatement as the law of Pennsylvania. However, the suggestion for a “move” to the\n\nThird Restatement, or adoption of certain of its principles, has been made in several\n\nnon-precedential opinions.\n\n14\n         By comparison, doctrinal separation played a noticeably less prominent role in an\nearlier decision relating to whether contributory negligence was an available defense to\na strict liability claim. In McCown v. International Harvester Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1945597\"><a href=\"/opinion/1945597/mccown-v-international-harvester-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.\n1975), the Court held that contributory negligence was not an available defense in a\nstrict liability case because such recognition would contradict the normal expectation of\nproduct safety upon which the strict liability cause of action is premised. “One does not\ninspect a product for defects or guard against the possibility of product defects when\none assumes the item to be safe.” Id. at 382.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 63\n\f       In 2003, the question before a six-Justice Court was whether a supplier was\n\nresponsible in strict liability to a consumer-plaintiff other than the intended user of the\n\nproduct.   See Phillips v. Cricket Lighters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1967435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1967435/phillips-v-cricket-lighters/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 2003) (OAJC).             The\n\nplaintiff had alleged that the butane lighter designed and manufactured by the defendant\n\nwas defective because it lacked a safety device that would have prevented a two year-\n\nold from setting the tragic fire that killed the child, his sibling and his mother. In relevant\n\npart, the Court reversed the decision of the Superior Court and reinstated the trial\n\ncourt’s summary judgment order. The Court was deeply divided in its reasoning.\n\n       The single Justice OAJC authored by Mr. Chief Justice Cappy concluded that a\n\nproduct is not defective if it is safe for its intended user. Id. at 1005. The OAJC rejected\n\nthe plaintiff’s argument that a manufacturer should be responsible for harm to a\n\nforeseeable albeit unintended user, opining that foreseeability concepts have no\n\napplication in strict liability theory and foreseeable users may recover by proving\n\nnegligence.    Among other things, the OAJC recognized that some strict liability\n\ndecisions had relied upon foreseeability principles but the opinion denounced the\n\npractice and would have reaffirmed the firm conceptual distinction between strict liability\n\nand negligence causes of action. Id. at 1007 (citing Davis v. Berwind Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1970034\"><a href=\"/opinion/1970034/davis-v-berwind-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1997)). “Recognition that strict liability is not a type of mongrel derivative of\n\nnegligence is also consistent with the historical development of this cause of action.\n\nStrict liability was intended to be a cause of action separate and distinct from\n\nnegligence, designed to fill a perceived gap in our tort law.” Id. (citing Azzarello, 391\n\nA.2d at 1023-24). In a footnote, the OAJC noted the supplier’s alternative argument\n\nrelating to the Third Restatement, but deemed it waived. Mr. Justice Nigro concurred in\n\nthe result, without an opinion.       Madame Justice Newman filed a concurring and\n\ndissenting opinion, in which she agreed with the OAJC that the strict liability claims\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 64\n\ffailed because the lighter was safe for its intended use by adults; Justice Newman\n\ndissented from that part of the opinion addressing the disposition of the plaintiff’s\n\nnegligence claim. Id. at 1024 (Newman, J., concurring and dissenting).\n\n       Mr. Justice Saylor authored a concurring opinion, which this author and Mr.\n\nJustice Eakin joined.    Justice Saylor advocated taking the opportunity to address\n\nfoundational matters, to reassess Pennsylvania’s Second Restatement approach, and\n\nto examine the range of readily accessible, corrective measures, including adoption of\n\nthe Third Restatement. In relevant part, the concurrence addressed three points: first,\n\nthat strict liability doctrine is embedded with concepts central to negligence theory;\n\nsecond, that ambiguities and inconsistencies in prevailing strict liability jurisprudence\n\naffected the proper disposition of the appeal; and third, that the Third Restatement’s\n\napproach would provide the most viable route to clarification and remediation of strict\n\nliability jurisprudence in Pennsylvania.\n\n       On the first point, Justice Saylor noted that the Second Restatement articulation\n\nfor the strict liability cause of action posed difficulties in application to design defect\n\nclaims. At origin, Justice Saylor explained, the standard derived from manufacturing\n\ndefect cases, in which “something went wrong in the manufacturing process” and the\n\nresulting product was not as safe as intended. The core objectives of the Second\n\nRestatement had been to relieve consumer-plaintiffs of the burden of proving that the\n\nsupplier had exercised due care in the manufacturing process (necessary to prove\n\nnegligence), and to spread the risk of loss among consumers. But, Justice Saylor\n\nobserved, courts had since recognized the “limitations of the just implementation of loss\n\nspreading via judicially crafted doctrine.” Id. at 1013 n.3 (citing Duchess v. Langston\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310683\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310683/duchess-v-langston-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1145 (Pa. 2001)). Consistent with its purposes, the Second\n\nRestatement declared a supplier liable even if it exercised all possible care in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 65\n\fpreparation and sale of the product. But, application of the doctrine was limited to\n\ndefective products unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or his property.                  The\n\nconcurrence noted that the Second Restatement formulation, as a result, contained an\n\ninternal tension: the strict liability rule “was tempered by a negligence-based concept of\n\ndefect.” In application to design defect claims, the concurrence further observed, courts\n\nin Pennsylvania recognized “an integral role for risk-utility (or cost-benefit) balancing,\n\nderived from negligence theory.” Id. at 1013-14 (citing Azzarello, 391 A.2d at 1026;\n\nBurch v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (Pa. Super. 1983); Dambacher v.\n\nMallis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 (Pa. Super. 1984)). As a result, while the rhetoric of retaining\n\na firm separation between strict liability and negligence remained pervasive in\n\ndecisional law, in application, the distinction was unnecessary: “[i]n design cases the\n\ncharacter of the product and the conduct of the manufacturer are largely inseparable.”\n\nThe concurrence advocated recognition of the essential role played by negligence-\n\nderived risk-utility balancing in design defect litigation. Id. at 1015-16.\n\n       Relating to the second point, the concurrence offered a critique of Azzarello,\n\nwhich is particularly relevant since Omega Flex echoes the analysis in this appeal.\n\nAccording to the concurrence, courts have implemented the Azzarello decision by: (1)\n\nassigning the risk-utility balancing to trial courts on the facts most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff; and (2) providing juries with minimalistic instructions that, in an effort to insulate\n\nthe jury from negligence terminology, “lack essential guidance concerning the nature of\n\nthe central conception of product defect.” Because the jury is not permitted to consider\n\nthe cost-benefit factors, neither judge nor jury “actually decide whether the true benefits\n\nof the proposed alternative design outweigh the true cost” and whether the product is in\n\nfact unreasonably dangerous or defective. Furthermore, the concurrence added that,\n\nby omitting the critical “unreasonably dangerous” limitation on liability or cost-benefit\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 66\n\finstructions, the Azzarello-approved charge fails to define the term “defect” clearly, and\n\nconsequently fails to guide the jury in distinguishing products safe and unsafe for their\n\nintended use.    The concurrence also noted that the use of the term “guarantor” in\n\nrelation to the manufacturer is not a sufficient limitation on liability, especially because\n\nthe term “to a lay jury will surely seem indistinguishable from ‘insurer.’” 841 A.2d at\n\n1016-18 (citing Thomas, 71 Temp. L. Rev. at 225 & 232). The concurrence advocated\n\ncorrection of this jurisprudence in the interest of justice.\n\n        On the final point, the concurrence suggested the Third Restatement as a viable\n\nalternative articulation of the standard of proof, with the potential to resolve the\n\npersisting difficulties and to enhance fairness and efficacy in the liability schema. Id. at\n\n1021.    According to the concurrence, the Third Restatement’s negligence-derived\n\nstandard represents “the distilled expression of thirty years of design-defect litigation.”\n\nThe concurrence summarized the general rule of the Third Restatement as follows: “a\n\nproduct is deemed defective in design when the foreseeable risks could have been\n\nreduced or avoided by the use of a reasonable alternative design, and when the failure\n\nto utilize such a design has caused the product to be ‘not reasonably safe.’” The\n\nconcurrence explained that design defect liability under the Third Restatement is\n\npredicated upon a concept of responsibility in which the determination is made by\n\nreference to an independent assessment of advantages and disadvantages, rather than\n\nby reference to the manufacturer’s own design or marketing standards, which are in fact\n\nalleged to be unreasonable by the plaintiff.         Moreover, the concurrence stressed,\n\nproducts are not defective simply because they are dangerous. Relevant to the issue in\n\nPhillips, the concurrence added that the Third Restatement expressly incorporates\n\nnotions of reasonable foreseeability that would temper the exclusive reliance on the\n\nrisk-utility test. In the view of the concurrence, the Third Restatement provided the best-\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 67\n\fbalanced and reasoned approach to strict liability in Pennsylvania. On a final note, the\n\nconcurrence opined that application of the strict liability doctrine should be closely\n\nlimited until the existing substantial deficiencies in the strict liability schema are\n\naddressed and remedied by the Court.\n\n       In 2006, the Court decided General Services, the case upon which Omega Flex\n\nrelies extensively. The Court there awarded the supplier a new trial, holding that the\n\ntrial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that a supplier is liable only for harm that\n\noccurs in connection with the intended use of a product by an intended user. 898 A.2d\n\nat 600 (citing Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1007 (OAJC); id. at 1018 (Saylor, J., concurring,\n\njoined by Castille & Eakin, JJ.); id. at 1023 (Newman, J., concurring and dissenting). In\n\nGeneral Services, a Commonwealth agency asserted claims in strict liability against,\n\ninter alia, the manufacturer of a synthetic chemical detected on surfaces and in the\n\nambient air of the Transportation and Safety Building, an office tower in Harrisburg,\n\nfollowing a fire that consumed building materials containing the chemical. The supplier\n\noffered proposed jury instructions, which the trial court rejected, that would have\n\ndistinguished between the supplier’s liability exposure for fire-related and other\n\ncontamination with the synthetic chemical.\n\n       In an opinion by Justice Saylor, the General Services Court noted the consensus\n\nin Phillips, supra, against “expanding the scope of manufacturer liability without fault in a\n\ngeneralized fashion” pending an overhaul of strict liability doctrine by the Court. In this\n\nrespect, the Court acknowledged that accidental combustion of the building materials\n\nwas foreseeable and that an argument could be made for the notion that safety for an\n\nintended use of the materials should be deemed to encompass safety under such\n\ncircumstances. The Court nevertheless rejected the argument that expansion of liability\n\npremised upon negligence-based foreseeability considerations was warranted,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 68\n\femphasizing an incongruity with simultaneously constraining a supplier’s resort to\n\nnegligence-based use-related defenses. See 898 A.2d at 600-04. Absent expansion of\n\nliability, the Court explained, the Commonwealth agency could not recover damages\n\ncaused by the incineration of building materials, which was not a use intended by the\n\nmanufacturer. A cause of action in strict liability remained viable for harm caused by\n\ncontamination of the Commonwealth agency’s office building through off-gassing of the\n\nchemical. Id. at 604.15\n\n       Poised to address foundational questions relating to the application of the strict\n\nliability doctrine in Pennsylvania, in 2008, the Court granted allowance of appeal in\n\nBugosh v. I.U. North Am., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2308557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2308557/bugosh-v-iu-north-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 2008) (per curiam).                 In 2009,\n\nhowever, the Court dismissed the ensuing appeal as improvidently granted; Justice\n\nSaylor, joined by this author, dissented from the summary disposition. See Bugosh,\n\n971 A.2d at 1228; id. at 1229-44 (Saylor J., dissenting, joined by Castille, C.J.).\n\n       In a dissenting statement, Justice Saylor reiterated that foundational concerns\n\npersisted in the area of strict liability and, by way of background, recapitulated the main\n\n\n15\n       Also of note, in General Services, Justice Newman dissented in part, and Mr.\nJustice Baer joined Justice Newman’s expression. The dissent argued that the matter\nimplicated not a misuse of the product by a user, as Phillips had, but a situation in which\nduring an intended use by an intended user, the product was exposed to easily\nanticipated conditions. Justice Newman would have found the doctrine of strict liability\napplicable, on a theory akin to the “crashworthiness exception,” and would have denied\nthe manufacturer’s request for a new trial. Id. at 619. Omega Flex argues that the\nTinchers relied upon the theory described by the dissent and rejected by the General\nServices majority. But, the General Services majority noted that its “discussion [did] not\naddress a situation in which a defect in the building materials is the cause of\ncombustion occurring during their ordinary use.” 898 A.2d at 601 n.11. The Tinchers’\nallegations are precisely that a defect in the CSST was a cause of the fire occurring\nduring the CSST’s ordinary use. The decision in General Services is, as a result,\ndistinguishable on its face, notwithstanding Omega Flex’s arguments to the contrary.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 69\n\fpoints of the Phillips concurrence. The dissent also noted that the categorical divide\n\nbetween strict liability and negligence principles, articulated in the cases, is most readily\n\njustified in manufacturing defect cases; claims implicating design or warning defect,\n\nhowever, are far more problematic.        Relevant to design defect claims, the dissent\n\nexplained that doctrinal limiting principles evolved to contain the liability of product\n\nsuppliers because traditional notions of strict liability were ill-suited to a tort regime with\n\na largely open-ended damages scheme and the reality that all product designs are\n\ncapable of contributing to human injury. According to the dissent, the alternative of a\n\njudicially imposed mandatory insurance scheme upon the business community is\n\nunpalatable and incongruent with the general rejection of a pure loss-spreading tort\n\nsystem. Id. at 1234-35 & n.10 (citing Cafazzo v. Central Med.

The dissent suggested a\n\nnegligence-derived risk-utility approach to limiting supplier liability, aimed at establishing\n\nliability boundaries and reconciling strict liability doctrine with the historical grounding of\n\ntort law in notions of corrective justice. In this regard, the dissent noted with approval\n\ndecisional law regarding policy justifications for limiting supplier liability: “incentivizing\n\nsafer design by rewarding careful manufacturers; the recognition that a verdict for a\n\nplaintiff in a product liability case is tantamount to a determination that an entire product\n\nline is defective, and therefore, the higher threshold of fault is justified; a fault system\n\nincorporates greater intrinsic fairness by not burdening manufacturers and their\n\ncustomers with the cost of insuring against all possible losses; and liberalized modern\n\ndiscovery rules should enable plaintiffs to learn the facts surrounding manufacturers’\n\ndeliberate design decisions.” Id. at 1235 & n.9 (citing Prentis v.

The dissent suggested that existing jurisprudence\n\nattempting to justify the doctrinal divide upon loss-spreading and deterrence-based\n\nrationales was stated in “too conclusory terms” and “too powerful” language to be well-\n\nreasoned. “Courts are not experts in manufacturer behavior, and there are equally\n\nreasonable arguments to be made that a negligence-based standard does more to\n\nencourage safer products than an absolute liability scheme.          Moreover, courts and\n\ncommentators have noted that these types of unsupported social policy judgments can\n\nhave tremendous social consequences.” Id. at 1239 (citing Prentis, supra; David G.\n\nOwen, SYMPOSIUM: A TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR DAVID FISCHER: DESIGN DEFECTS, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mo.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nRev. 291, 296 (2008)). Among the consequences, the dissent noted that when a verdict\n\nfor the plaintiff in a design defect case effectively suggests that an entire product line is\n\ndefective, the consequence may involve a significant portion of a supplier’s assets and\n\ndeprive the public of the product. On a broader scale, such a liability scheme has the\n\npotential to unduly disrupt product investment and innovation. Id.; see also Beard, 41\n\nA.3d at 837 (same). According to the dissent, these potential effects are relevant in any\n\nviable strict liability scheme.\n\n       The dissent recognized some force in the argument that the General Assembly is\n\nbest positioned to alter the existing product liability schema. But, the dissent noted,\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 71\n\fbecause the Legislature had not occupied the arena, which remained in a state of\n\nsubstantial disrepair that had “taken our jurisprudence too far from the legitimate home\n\nof tort law in the concept of corrective justice,” action by the Court was permissible and\n\nnecessary.   “To the degree a distinct category of ‘strict’ product liability doctrine is\n\nnecessary, at most, it always has been, and rationally should be, one of quasi-strict\n\nliability, tempered, in design and warning cases, with the legitimate involvement of\n\nnotions of foreseeability and reasonableness within the purview of the fact finder.” Id. at\n\n1240. The dissent then suggested filling the “substantial void” that would be left by\n\ndisapproval of Azzarello with a prospective movement to the Third Restatement\n\nposition.\n\n       Importantly, as an alternative, the dissent suggested that, while continuing the\n\nsearch for the perfect vehicle by which to devise a replacement strict liability scheme,\n\nthe Court could “at least depart from Azzarello prospectively, thus clearing a path for our\n\ncommon pleas and intermediate appellate courts to consider the reasoned\n\nrecommendations of the Third Restatement, as well as other reasoned alternatives\n\nand/or refinements.”    Bugosh, 942 A.2d at 1241.        This latter approach would be\n\nadequate because the difficulties described by the dissent are with Azzarello rather than\n\nthe Second Restatement itself.       In the dissent’s view, the Court should start by\n\nreaffirming the understanding that “modern products liability law rests fundamentally on\n\nthe premise that manufacturers are fairly held to answer in the courts for the basic\n\nsafety of their products’ designs.” Id. at 1242 (citing Owen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mo.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 291). The\n\ndissent suggested that, in that scenario, the Legislature could appropriately undertake\n\ntimely, comprehensive reform in light of the broader tools that it has available for\n\nweighing competing interests.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 72\n\f       In 2008, in parallel to the proceedings in Bugosh, the Court denied the request of\n\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for certification of a question of law\n\nrelating to the application under Pennsylvania law of the intended use doctrine to\n\nprevent recovery in strict liability by innocent bystanders. See Berrier, 959 A.2d at 901\n\n(per curiam).        In a concurring statement, Justice Saylor noted his preference for\n\naddressing the global issues pervading strict liability doctrine, before engaging in the\n\ncollateral effects implicated by the certified question. Relating to the application of the\n\nintended user doctrine to limit liability, the concurrence observed that fair compensation\n\nto bystanders was not precluded but, rather, it was channeled into negligence theory,\n\nwhere claims would rise or fall on their merits. Id. (Saylor, J., concurring, joined by\n\nCastille, C.J.).16\n\n       In other relevant developments, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\n\nhas predicted that, if this Court were to directly confront the issue, we would adopt the\n\nThird Restatement’s formulation of the strict liability doctrine. See Berrier, 563 F.3d at\n\n40.   The Third Circuit reasoned that Justice Saylor’s concurring opinion in Phillips\n\nforeshadowed this Court’s adoption of Sections 1 and 2 of the Third Restatement’s\n\ndefinition of the strict liability cause of action. Id. at 53. The Berrier Court went on to\n\napply Third Restatement principles to permit a bystander, as distinguished from a user\n\n16\n       In several recent cases, the Court resolved other claims tangential to\nfundamental concepts of strict liability.

The Continuing Viability of Azzarello and Its Progeny\n\n       In this case, the question is posed of whether the rationale of Azzarello, and its\n\nprogeny, should retain viability.    Precedent, of course, is not infallible; if we are to\n\nensure both the perception and the reality of justice, we must be willing to reexamine\n\nprecedent if it is demonstrated that a prior rule does not serve, or no longer adequately\n\nserves, the interests of justice. See Ayala, 305 A.2d at 888; Carney, 79 A.3d at 505.\n\n       Here, the parties agree that the decision in Azzarello articulates governing legal\n\nconcepts which fail to reflect the realities of strict liability practice and to serve the\n\ninterests of justice. Several members of this Court have suggested in the past this very\n\nassessment of Azzarello.        See, e.g., Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1016-18 (Saylor, J.,\n\nconcurring, joined by Castille and Eakin, JJ.); Berrier, 959 A.2d at 901 (Saylor, J.,\n\n\n17\n       Until Berrier, in diversity jurisdiction matters, the Third Circuit applied\nPennsylvania law as articulated in Azzarello.

The Circuit recognized that\nthis Court had not expressly approved of risk-utility approach in design defect matters;\nthe Third Circuit relied instead upon Superior Court precedent and inquired into\nconsistency with this Court’s pronouncements in existing decisional law.

We agree that reconsideration of Azzarello is\n\nnecessary and appropriate and, to the extent that the pronouncements in Azzarello are\n\nin tension with the principles articulated in this Opinion, the decision in Azzarello is\n\noverruled. We add the following observations.\n\n        As we have noted, Azzarello held that the phrase “unreasonably dangerous” is\n\nper se misleading to lay jurors and, as a result, the Court dictated that any questions\n\nrelating to the risks and utilities of a product are to be decided by the trial court as a\n\nmatter of law and policy.      Moreover, Azzarello approved, and thereby essentially\n\nrequired, instructions which informed the jury that, for the purposes of a supplier’s strict\n\nliability in tort, “the product must, therefore, be provided with every element necessary\n\nto make it safe for its intended) use.” 391 A.2d at 1025 & 1027 n.12. Subsequent\n\ndecisional law has applied Azzarello broadly, to the point of directing that negligence\n\nconcepts have no place in Pennsylvania strict liability doctrine; and, as we explain,\n\nthose decisions essentially led to puzzling trial directives that the bench and bar\n\nunderstandably have had difficulty following in practice, including in the present matter.\n\nCf. Phillips, supra.\n\n        The Azzarello Court premised its broad holding on the assumption that the term\n\n“unreasonably dangerous” is misleading to jurors because it “tends to suggest\n\nconsiderations which are usually identified with the law of negligence.” 391 A.2d at\n\n1025.    Although that general notion had some support in prior observations in\n\nPennsylvania cases, see Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 899-900 (Jones, C.J.), the Azzarello\n\nCourt cemented the notion by focusing on the expression “unreasonably dangerous” out\n\nof the context of the jury charge in which it appeared and pressing upon it a deceptively\n\nsimple, and indeed dogmatic, significance. See Commonwealth v. Murphy, 739 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 75\n\f141, 146 (Pa. 1999) (Court evaluates jury charge to determine whether it is accurate\n\nand clear statement of law; charge is read and considered in its entirety, and its general\n\neffect controls); accord Commonwealth v.

The\n\nCourt parsed the language of the Second Restatement, particularly the terms “defective\n\ncondition” and “unreasonably dangerous,” for a precise meaning and the reporter’s\n\nintent in the utilization of those terms. See 391 A.2d at 1024-25 (“We must focus upon\n\ntwo requirements set forth in Section 402A for liability (physical injury) that the product\n\nbe ‘in defective condition’ and that it be ‘unreasonably dangerous.’”) (emphasis added).\n\nBut, Section 402A does not articulate legal “requirements” as a statute may; and,\n\nmoreover, the “intent” of the reporter is, of course, not due the same weight as a\n\npronouncement of legislative intent in statutory construction. Any given restatement\n\nsection simply states, or restates, principles of the common law, general rules reflecting\n\na purported consensus, whose validity ultimately depends on the reasoning that\n\nsupports them. Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1385. Yet, the Azzarello Court seemed to engage in\n\na statutory-type construction of Section 402A, including by proceeding to presume every\n\npart of Section 402A effective. The rule derived by Azzarello premised upon this type of\n\nanalysis is that negligence concepts and rhetoric -- although addressed in the negative\n\nby the Restatement -- somehow affected a plaintiff’s burden of proof in all strict liability\n\ncases, regardless of the pertinent facts.\n\n       Speaking in generalities, the Azzarello Court concluded that negligence-related\n\nrhetoric saddles a plaintiff in a strict liability case with an additional and unwarranted\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 76\n\fburden of proof in every case. 391 A.2d at 1025 (quoting Cronin v.

The facts of Azzarello, when viewed with the\n\nappropriate judicial modesty, did not require such a broad pronouncement. The issue of\n\n“jury confusion” there arose in a distinct, fact-bound context of a jury trial in which claims\n\nof strict liability and counter-claims of negligence were asserted against distinct parties.\n\nThe Azzarello Court offered no explanation of either the nature of the perceived\n\nunwarranted additional burden nor how that burden altered the liability calculus for the\n\nAzzarello jury.   Nor did the Azzarello Court explain the leap in logic necessary to\n\nextrapolate that every lay jury would relate reasonableness and other negligence\n\nterminology, when offered in a strict liability charge, to a “heavier,” negligence-based\n\nburden of proof. Jury charges are generally delivered orally to ordinary citizens, and not\n\nby written transmission to be pored over by scholars or lawyers aware of other forms of\n\nliability not always at issue. See Sepulveda, 55 A.3d at 1142. The concern with across-\n\nthe-board jury confusion, especially where counsel is there to suggest adaptation of\n\nstandard charges and to hear the charge as a whole, is simply overstated. See id.\n\nDistinctions in theories of products liability are no more or less confusing than in other\n\ndifficult areas of law -- note, as but one example, the shifting burdens, levels of proof,\n\nand consensus requirements in the penalty phase of a capital case. It is generally\n\n“incumbent upon the parties, through their attorneys, to aid courts in narrowing issues\n\nand formulating appropriate instructions to guide juries in their factual determinations . .\n\n. .”   Scampone, 57 A.3d at 598.        Yet, the Azzarello Court issued a decision that\n\nconflated a determination of the facts and its related yet distinct conceptual\n\nunderpinnings, which essentially perpetuated jury confusion in future strict liability\n\ncases, rather than dissipating it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 77\n\f        The Azzarello Court found support for its holding not in the Restatement itself, or\n\nin any source of Pennsylvania law, but in the decisions of the Supreme Court of\n\nCalifornia in Cronin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1180351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1180351/cronin-v-jbe-olson-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and of the New Jersey Superior Court in Glass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2288144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2288144/glass-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Pennsylvania, unfortunately, did not adjust its\n\njurisprudence in light of these developments that eroded Azzarello’s underpinnings.\n\n        It is also worth noting that Azzarello was distinguishable from Cronin on the facts.\n\nIn Cronin, the defendant challenged on appeal the trial court’s decision to deny an\n\ninstruction to the jury, which provided in pertinent part that, in addition to adducing proof\n\nof a defect, the plaintiff had the burden of proving “[t]hat the defective condition made it\n\nunreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.”            501 P.2d at 1158 n.6.       The\n\ndefendant suggested a distinction between the two elements of proof, reminiscent of\n\nliability for an abnormally dangerous activity, such as blasting. See RESTATEMENT (2D)\n\nOF   TORTS § 519(1) (“One who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject\n\nto liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of another resulting from the activity,\n\nalthough he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm.”) (emphasis added);\n\nsee also id. §§ 520-524A. The Cronin Court rejected the defendant’s challenge to the\n\njury instructions, on the ground that it placed an unwarranted burden of proof on the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 78\n\f       Importantly, decisional law eschews the Cronin defendant’s application of\n\nSection 402A, and the causes of action in strict liability for products and for an\n\nabnormally dangerous activity are recognized as carrying distinct burdens for the\n\nplaintiff. By comparison, in Azzarello, the error of which the plaintiff complained on\n\nappeal was that speaking of reasonableness in a jury instruction issued in a case in\n\nwhich only negligence allegations were made against a cross-defendant/employer\n\ntended to mislead the jury as to the plaintiff’s burden of proof in its own distinct strict\n\nliability case against the defendant/manufacturer.       While similar considerations may\n\nhave been pertinent, certainly a nuanced analysis of the Cronin decision in the context\n\nof the Azzarello arguments would have served for better generalized guidance to the\n\nbench and bar.\n\n       This case speaks volumes to the necessity of reading legal rules -- especially\n\nbroad rules -- against their facts and the corollary that judicial pronouncements should\n\nemploy due modesty. See Maloney, 984 A.2d at 489–90 (“For one thing, it is very\n\ndifficult for courts to determine the range of factual circumstances to which a particular\n\nrule should apply in light of the often myriad possibilities”; of particular concern is “the\n\npossibility that words or phrases or sentences may be taken out of context and treated\n\nas doctrines.”). As courts have struggled with the application of the deceptively simple\n\nAzzarello rule that a jury must be insulated from negligence concepts and rhetoric in\n\nstrict liability cases, decisional law has lapsed into an arguably unprincipled formulaic\n\napplication of rhetoric, threatening to render the strict liability cause of action hopelessly\n\nunmoored in modern circumstances.\n\n       Compounding the problem of extrapolating broad lessons from very particular\n\ncircumstances, the Azzarello Court accomplished its goal of insulating juries from\n\nnegligence concepts and rhetoric by: (1) holding that the determination “as to the risk of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 79\n\floss” is a decision to be made by the trial court rather than the jury; and (2) “approving”\n\njury instructions in strict liability cases generally. The Court explained this decision by\n\nsaying that: “While a lay finder of fact is obviously competent in resolving a dispute as to\n\nthe condition of a product, an entirely different question is presented where a decision\n\nas to whether that condition justifies placing liability upon the supplier must be made.”\n\nThe Court then suggested that it is within the trial court’s bailiwick to answer questions\n\nof law whose resolution “depends upon social policy” such as: “Should an ill-conceived\n\ndesign which exposes the user to the risk of harm entitle one injured by the product to\n\nrecover? Should adequate warnings of the dangerous propensities of an article insulate\n\none who suffers injuries from those propensities? When does the utility of a product\n\noutweigh the unavoidable danger it may pose?” According to the Court, “[i]t is a judicial\n\nfunction to decide whether, under plaintiff’s averment of the facts, recovery would be\n\njustified; and only after this judicial determination is made is the cause submitted to the\n\njury to determine whether the facts of the case support the averments of the complaint.\n\nThey do not fall within the orbit of a factual dispute which is properly assigned to the jury\n\nfor resolution.” Without further explanation of these broad assumptions, bottomed on\n\nnotions of social policy, the Court concluded that “[a] standard suggesting the existence\n\nof a ‘defect’ if the article is unreasonably dangerous or not duly safe is inadequate to\n\nguide a lay jury” and adopted in its stead a formulation by which the seller would be held\n\nliable unless the seller “provide[d] with the product every element necessary to make it\n\nsafe for use.” 391 A.2d at 1025-27 (quoting Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 902 (Jones, C.J.)).\n\nThe 1987 decision in Lewis acknowledged Azzarello’s innovation, noting that it offered a\n\ndistinct standard from either a risk-utility test or a consumer expectation test. 528 A.2d\n\nat 593.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 80\n\f        The Azzarello Court attributed the new standard of proof to the one-justice lead\n\nopinion of Chief Justice Jones in Berkebile, which the Court quoted out of context.\n\nAdditionally, the endorsed jury charge significantly altered the import of the Berkebile\n\npassage. Compare Berkebile, 337 A.2d at 902 (Jones, C.J.) (emphasis added) (“seller\n\nmust provide with the product every element necessary to make it safe for use”;\n\nnotion of defect includes claim for failure to warn, in addition to claims for manufacturing\n\nand design defects) (emphasis added) with Azzarello, 391 A.2d at 1027 n.12 (“product\n\nmust, therefore, be provided with every element necessary to make it safe for (its\n\nintended) use, and without any condition that makes it unsafe for (its intended) use”)\n\n(emphasis added).        Predictably, the “approval” of such jury instructions operated to\n\ndiscourage the exercise of judicial discretion in charging the jury, including in the\n\nTinchers’ case, and likely stunted the development of the common law in this area from\n\nproceeding in a more logical, experience-based and reason-bound fashion. See, e.g.,\n\nN.T., 10/20/2010, at 825 (emphasis added).\n\n        The greater difficulty is that the Azzarello standard is impracticable.        As an\n\nillustration of its new standard’s application, the Azzarello Court offered that a supplier is\n\nnot an insurer of a product, although it is a guarantor; these terms of art, with no further\n\nexplanation of their practical import, also mirrored the standard jury charge approved by\n\nAzzarello.     The Court did not purport to articulate a departure from the Second\n\nRestatement formulation, nor did it discuss the reasoning for or implications of doing so.\n\nYet, the Azzarello Court chose this iteration of the law to fill the legal void caused by its\n\nbright-line rule that any negligence rhetoric carries an undue risk of misleading lay jurors\n\nin strict liability cases.\n\n        Omega Flex, subscribing to existing criticism of this scheme, faults Azzarello for\n\n(1) removing from the jury the risk-utility calculus implicated in what Azzarello called “the\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 81\n\frisk of loss” determination; and (2) requiring the trial court to make the determination\n\nbefore the facts even are in evidence, premised merely upon the plaintiff’s allegations\n\nand with all inferences benefitting the plaintiff. Although the argument is not explicitly\n\nmade to this Court, the obvious suggestion is that the scheme burdens the defendant’s\n\nright to a fair jury trial. Setting aside any potential, but here unpreserved, due process\n\nor right to a jury claims, the unsupported assumptions and conclusory statements upon\n\nwhich Azzarello’s directives are built are problematic on their face.\n\n       First, the notion that a legal inquiry into “whether that condition justifies placing\n\nliability upon the supplier” (product is unreasonably dangerous) is, albeit distinguishable,\n\nentirely separable from a factual inquiry into the predicate “condition of a product”\n\n(defective condition of product) when determining whether to affix liability upon a\n\nsupplier is incompatible with basic principles of strict liability. Thus, in a jurisdiction\n\nfollowing the Second Restatement formulation of strict liability in tort, the critical inquiry\n\nin affixing liability is whether a product is “defective”; in the context of a strict liability\n\nclaim, whether a product is defective depends upon whether that product is\n\n“unreasonably dangerous.” Yet, Azzarello divorced one inquiry from the other: under\n\nthe Azzarello scheme, the trial court serves as the gate-keeper of one question with the\n\napparent task of deciding as a matter of law and policy whether a product is one even\n\nsusceptible to a strict liability claim. As a practical matter, the Azzarello decision did not\n\nindicate at which point of the trial the court should consider the question, nor what\n\npleadings or evidence would be relevant to the inquiry; the Court did suggest, however,\n\nthat the matter “d[id] not fall within the orbit of a factual dispute.” 391 A.2d at 1026.\n\n       Second, the practical reality, as exemplified by the matter before us, is that trial\n\ncourts simply do not necessarily have the expertise to conduct the social policy inquiry\n\ninto the risks and utilities of a plethora of products and to decide, as a matter of law,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 82\n\fwhether a product is unreasonably dangerous except perhaps in the most obvious of\n\ncases (e.g., where injury is caused by a knife), where a gate-keeper’s function is hardly\n\nnecessary.    In this case, Omega Flex moved for summary judgment before trial, a\n\nnonsuit after the close of the Tinchers’ case, and then renewed the motion for a nonsuit\n\nafter both parties rested, asking the court to determine whether the TracPipe System\n\nwas unreasonably dangerous. Although the trial court denied all motions, the court\n\naddressed the merits of the risk-utility calculus on the record only in the context of the\n\nmotions for nonsuit. See N.T., 10/18/2010, at 514-15 (“The [trial c]ourt had denied the\n\n[summary judgment] motion, presumably, although I don’t know for sure, because it\n\nthought this might be an issue of fact that needed to be heard at trial.”). Given the\n\nopportunity to rule on Omega Flex’s motions for nonsuit, the trial court reviewed the\n\nevidence introduced at trial before denying the motions, in addition to evidence deemed\n\ninadmissible at trial -- i.e., proof of a redesigned TracPipe System, marketed as\n\n“Counterstrike,” that was resistant to lightning strikes. See id. at 514-26 & 721-41; Tr.\n\nCt. Op., 8/5/2011, at 11-20. This matter illustrates that the assumptions upon which the\n\nAzzarello Court assigned the task of determining whether a product is unreasonably\n\ndangerous are impractical. In the alternative, a strict reading of Azzarello is undesirable\n\nbecause it would encourage trial courts to make either uninformed or unfounded\n\ndecisions of social policy that then substantially determine the course and outcome of\n\nthe trial.\n\n        Subsequent application of Azzarello elevated the notion that negligence concepts\n\ncreate confusion in strict liability cases to a doctrinal imperative, whose merits were not\n\nexamined to determine whether such a bright-line rule was consistent with reason in\n\nlight of the considerations pertaining to the case. Beyond the merits of the narrow\n\nholdings in the several cases, the effect of the per se rule that negligence rhetoric and\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 83\n\fconcepts were to be eliminated from strict liability law was to validate the suggestion\n\nthat the cause of action, so shaped, was not viable, and to invite calls for reform. In\n\n2009, the Third Circuit predicted that this Court would simply adopt the Third\n\nRestatement approach to the strict liability doctrine; this Court has not taken that\n\ndecisional leap.\n\n\n\n         D.     The Strict Product Liability Cause of Action in Pennsylvania\n\n       Overruling Azzarello leaves a gap, going forward, in our strict liability\n\njurisprudence. The preferable solution may be to have the General Assembly address\n\nthis arena of substantive law.       But, so long as the possibility of comprehensive\n\nlegislative reform remains unlikely or uncertain, this Court retains the authority and duty\n\nat common law to take necessary action to avoid injustice, uncertainty, delay, and the\n\npossibility of different standards and procedures being employed in different courtrooms\n\nthroughout the Commonwealth.

Disagreement among jurisdictions\n\nremains in defining the nature of that duty. Thus, the policy of some jurisdictions is that\n\nthose who engage in the business of selling a product are subject to a duty of due care\n\nin manufacturing and selling the product.        See, e.g., Prentis, 365 N.W.2d at 186\n\n(Michigan).20 By comparison, the policy of those jurisdictions that have incorporated the\n\nSecond Restatement into their common law is that those who engage in the business of\n\nselling a product are subject to both a duty of care in manufacturing and selling the\n\nproduct and a duty to sell a product free from a “defective condition.” The duty spoken\n\nof in strict liability is intended to be distinct from the duty of due care in negligence.\n\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A(2).\n\n       The duty in strict liability pertains to the duty of a manufacturer and of suppliers in\n\nthe chain of distribution to the ultimate consumer.

In incorporating the strict liability cause of\n\naction into Pennsylvania common law, the Webb Court expressly relied upon the\n\nSecond Restatement and relevant scholarly commentary to supply its justification. 220\n\nA.2d at 854.       Indeed, comments b, c, g, and m to Section 402A of the Second\n\nRestatement offer reasoned consideration of factors relevant in Pennsylvania to explain\n\nthe existence and nature of a seller’s duty in tort to a consumer. In part, comment c\n\nexplains that:\n\n                          [A] seller, by marketing his product for use and\n                 consumption, has undertaken and assumed a special\n                 responsibility toward any member of the consuming public\n                 who may be injured by it; that public has a right to and does\n                 expect, in [the] case of products which it needs and for which\n                 it is forced to rely upon the seller, that reputable sellers will\n                 stand behind their goods; that public policy demands that the\n                 burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for\n                 consumption be placed upon those who market them, and\n                 be treated as a cost of production against which liability\n                 insurance can be obtained; and that consumer of such\n                 products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the\n                 hands of someone, and proper persons to afford it are those\n                 who market the products.\nRESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS § 402A cmt. c.\n\n       This reasoning explains the nature of the non-delegable duty articulated by the\n\nSecond Restatement and recognized in Webb.

Its\n              natural application would be limited to the situation in which\n              something went wrong in the manufacturing process, so that\n              the article was defective in the sense that the manufacturer\n              had not intended it to be in that condition. To apply it also to\n              the case in which a warning is not attached to the chattel or\n              the design turns out to be a bad one or the product is likely\n              to be injurious in its normal condition, is to use the term in a\n              Pickwickian sense, with a special, esoteric meaning of its\n              own. It is not without reason that some people, in writing\n              about it, speak of the requirement of being “legally\n              defective,” including the quotation marks. To have to define\n              the term to the jury, with a meaning completely different from\n              the one they would normally give to it, is to create the\n              chance that they will be misled. To use it without defining it\n              to the jury is almost to ensure that they will be misled. . . .\n              Finally, the term “defective” gives an illusion of certainty by\n              suggesting a word with a purported specific meaning rather\n              than a term connoting a standard involving the weighing of\n              factors.\nPhillips, 841 A.2d 1017-18 (Saylor, J., concurring) (quoting Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Miss.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

See Coyle, 584 A.2d at 1387 (quoting\n\nRESTATEMENT (2D)    OF   TORTS § 402A cmt. c). The consumer has additional economic,\n\nmoral, and visceral interests in the sales price of the product, the availability of new or\n\ninnovative products, and in any spillover effects (e.g., increased social welfare and\n\nreduced strain on public resources related to fewer injuries and improved health;\n\nincreased employment, investment opportunities, value of shareholder equity).

See Welch, 481 F.2d at 254 (“A product is defective and\n\nunreasonably dangerous[, inter alia,] if the risks are greater than a reasonable buyer\n\nwould expect.”).

Several commentators have suggested that this test reflects the warranty law roots\n\nof strict liability in tort, and serves to vindicate significant interests central to the public\n\npolicy justifying the strict liability cause of action in the first place:\n\n\n                       Powerful reasons support protections of a consumer’s\n               expectations of product safety that arise from the safety\n               representations of a manufacturer or other seller, whether\n               those representations be express or implied. When making\n               safety “promises” in an effort to sell its products, a\n               manufacturer seeks to convince potential buyers that its\n               affirmations are both valuable and true. Safety information is\n               valuable to users because it provides a “frame of reference”\n               that permits a user to shift his or her limited cognitive and\n               other resources away from self-protection toward the pursuit\n               of other goals -- which in turn shifts responsibility for\n               protecting the user to the manufacturer. In this manner, true\n               safety information adds value to the product by enhancing\n               the user’s autonomy, for which value the consumer fairly\n               pays a price. So, if the information is not true but false, the\n               purchaser loses significant autonomy, as well as the benefit\n               of the bargain. Since an important purpose of the law is to\n               promote autonomy, and the equality of the buyer to the seller\n               as reflected in their deal, the law fairly may demand that the\n               seller rectify the underlying falsity and resulting inequality in\n               the exchange transaction if harm results.\nOwen, HORNBOOK, at 303 (footnote omitted); compare Putman, 338 F.2d at 913 n.8\n\n(“Liability in warranty arises where damage is caused by the failure of a product to\n\nmeasure up to express or implied representations on the part of the manufacturer or\n\nother supplier.”).\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 96\n\f       Application of the consumer expectations test in its purest form, however, has\n\ntheoretical and practical limitations. First, products whose danger is obvious or within\n\nthe ordinary consumer’s contemplation would be exempt from strict liability; some\n\ntherefore have said that related consumer safety expectations regarding the presence\n\nof the danger are too low.

Ford Motor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163793\"><a href=\"/opinion/163793/ahrens-v-ford-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th\n\nCir. 2003) (affirming district court decision that manufacturer not liable for defective\n\ndesign of tractor without seatbelt or for failing to warn of danger because plaintiff failed\n\nto adduce sufficient evidence that risk of danger was beyond contemplation of ordinary\n\nconsumer).    Second, a product whose danger is vague or outside the ordinary\n\nconsumer’s contemplation runs the risk of being subjected to arbitrary application of the\n\nstrict liability doctrine; jury determinations of consumer expectations regarding the\n\npresence of danger are unpredictable. This difficulty is characteristic of products of\n\nrelatively complex design. See, e.g., Heaton v.

But, while these considerations may\n\nprovide a holistic perspective on a manufacturer’s choice to bring a product to market,\n\nthey may not be immediately responsive in the (typical) case implicating allegations\n\nrelating to a particular design feature. See Owen, HORNBOOK, at 315 (“[T]he issue\n\nproperly litigated almost always concerns the narrow “micro-balance” of pros and cons\n\nof a manufacturer’s failure to adopt some particular design feature that would have\n\nprevented the plaintiff’s harm. . . .”); but see Beard, 41 A.3d at 838 (trial courts not\n\nrestricted to considering single use of multi-use product in design defect, threshold, risk-\n\nutility balancing). The difficulty in presenting the issue to the jury, Professor Owen\n\nsuggests, is resolved by reference to Judge Learned Hand’s formula, which “succinctly\n\ncaptures the common sense idea that products are unacceptably dangerous if they\n\ncontain dangers that might cost-effectively (and practicably) be removed.”             Owen,\n\nHORNBOOK, at 315 (applying Hand formula in strict liability means that jury will decide\n\nwhether seller “fails to adopt a burden of precaution of less magnitude than the harm it\n\nis likely to prevent”).\n\n       Application of a risk-utility balancing test in its purest form likewise has theoretical\n\nand practical shortcomings. The goal and strength of a pure risk-utility test is to achieve\n\nefficiency or “to maximize the common good”; yet, this is also its perceived weakness.\n\nSee Owen, HORNBOOK, at 316. For, while efficiency is certainly a salutary goal of the\n\nlaw, it is not its only purpose and, in some respects, it conflicts with bedrock moral\n\nintuitions regarding justice in determining proper compensation for injury to persons or\n\nproperty in individual cases. Compare id. at 318 (“manufacturer applying cost-benefit\n\nanalysis to safety decision-making in good faith thereby necessarily respects the\n\nequality and safety rights of consumers as a group”) with William E. Nelson, THE MORAL\n\nPERVERSITY    OF THE   HAND CALCULUS, 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 759, 761 (2001) (describing\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 100\n\flimitations of risk-utility analysis in negligence context; “[U]ltimately the Hand calculus is\n\nnot about social efficiency, love, friendship or moral arrogance.           It is only about\n\ncompensation. The Hand calculus does not tell an entrepreneur whether or not to\n\nengage in conduct that will hurt one person and help another. . . . The Hand calculus\n\nserves a much narrower function. It tells an entrepreneur only that, if she engages in\n\nconduct that causes others to lose more than she gains, she will have to compensate\n\nthem for their losses, but that, if she gains more than they lose, no duty of\n\ncompensation will arise. . . . It is this very narrowness of the Hand calculus that makes\n\nit so morally perverse. . . . ”).      We should be mindful that public policy adjusts\n\nexpectations of efficiency and intuitions of justice considerations, informing a seller’s\n\nconduct toward consumers as a group, and ensuring proper compensation in individual\n\ncases by judicial application of the strict liability cause of action.\n\n       Of course, several other causes of action in tort incorporate a risk-utility hindsight\n\nanalysis: for example, negligence and strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities\n\n(i.e., the use of product in manner and context where danger is substantial,\n\nunavoidable, and dissonant among neighboring uses, see Owen, HORNBOOK, at 328).\n\nNeither of those actions involves a pure application of the risk-utility calculus. Accord\n\nNelson, 45 St. Louis U. L. J. at 767 (“In sum, it might be right to understand the Hand\n\ncalculus as a device for articulating our moral intuitions rather than a device for\n\nsuperceding them.”); accord Blue, 828 N.E.2d at 1140-41 (hindsight analysis inherent in\n\nrisk-utility test has earmarks of determining negligence). Nor are these causes of action\n\nthe same, albeit when they define the scope of compensation, they use similar rhetoric\n\nimplicating danger / risk and reasonableness. See generally, supra, n.18 (explaining\n\nCronin). The distinction draws upon the public policy that each cause of action\n\nvindicates, which incorporates moral intuitions drawn from communal social experience\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 101\n\ffor the purposes of modifying (most often attenuating) the effect of a risk-utility\n\napplication to ascertain appropriate compensation. Ultimately, distinct duties (whether\n\nstatutory or common law) and related causes of action develop to reflect determinations\n\nregarding a desirable allocation of risk. Cf. Kernan v. Am.

One approach is to state the two standards in\n\nthe alternative; a plaintiff’s injury is compensable whether either test is met.

The combined standard, which states\n\nconsumer expectations and risk-utility tests in the alternative, retains the features of\n\neach test, in practice, offering the parties a composite of the most workable features of\n\nboth tests. See Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Beck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1134663\"><a href=\"/opinion/1134663/caterpillar-tractor-co-v-beck/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 884-85 (Alaska 1979)\n\nsuperseded in part by Alaska Stat. § 09.17.060 (1986); accord Soule, supra.\n\n       A second approach is to incorporate the risk calculus into a test of consumer\n\nexpectations or, vice versa, to incorporate consumer expectations into the risk-utility\n\ndetermination.    See, e.g., Vautour, 784 A.2d at 1182 (internal citations omitted)\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 102\n\f(“[P]roduct ‘must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated\n\nby the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the\n\ncommunity as to its characteristics.’ . . .

In\n\nCalifornia, for example, the Barker court allocated to the supplier the burden to prove\n\nthe adequacy of a product’s design under the “risk-benefit” standard (i.e., to disprove a\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case that a product is defective). The Court reasoned that most of\n\nthe evidentiary matters which may be relevant in a typical case involve technical issues\n\npeculiarly within the knowledge of the manufacturer. 573 P.2d at 455. Commentators\n\nhave suggested that another California case, see Soule, supra, offered yet another\n\nvariation by which the applicability of either prong of the combined Barker test depends\n\nupon the complexity of the product. See Owen, HORNBOOK, at 325; Henderson, 83\n\nCornell L. Rev. at 899 (Soule “found the test unsuitable for cases involving product\n\ndesigns of any complexity. The court in Soule held that it would thereafter countenance\n\nuse of a limited consumer expectations test in cases ‘in which the everyday experience\n\nof the product’s users permits a conclusion that the product’s design violated minimum\n\nsafety assumptions.’”) (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 103\n\f       It is questionable, however, that the Soule court sought to foreclose strict liability\n\nclaims premised upon a simple / complex classification, as the commentators have\n\nsuggested. Such a standard begs -- or shifts -- the question of which designs are\n\ncomplex enough for application of the preferred test. Moreover, the implication that a\n\ndistinct class of “simple” products is subject to a consumer expectations standard of\n\nliability which is relatively unsuccessful at producing fair results is contradicted by\n\nSoule’s continued adherence to that standard. See Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at\n\n879-82 (disappointment of consumer expectations is inappropriate standard for\n\ndefectiveness in classic design cases).       Ourselves having had the experience of\n\nattempting to bring various principles to bear upon a single complex case, we believe\n\nthat, placed into its proper context, Soule may be read as simply commenting upon the\n\ncourt’s experience with analogous matters and offering guidance to aid trial courts in\n\nproperly guiding the parties and the jury through the litigation process:\n\n                     As we have seen, the consumer expectations test is\n              reserved for cases in which the everyday experience of the\n              product’s users permits a conclusion that the product’s\n              design violated minimum safety assumptions, and is thus\n              defective regardless of expert opinion about the merits of the\n              design. It follows that where the minimum safety of a product\n              is within the common knowledge of lay jurors, expert\n              witnesses may not be used to demonstrate what an ordinary\n              consumer would or should expect. Use of expert testimony\n              for that purpose would invade the jury’s function (see Evid.\n              Code, § 801, subd. (a)), and would invite circumvention of\n              the rule that the risks and benefits of a challenged design\n              must be carefully balanced whenever the issue of design\n              defect goes beyond the common experience of the product's\n              users.\n\n                     By the same token, the jury may not be left free to find\n              a violation of ordinary consumer expectations whenever it\n              chooses. Unless the facts actually permit an inference that\n              the product’s performance did not meet the minimum safety\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 104\n\f               expectations of its ordinary users, the jury must engage in\n               the balancing of risks and benefits required by the second\n               prong of Barker.\n882 P.2d at 308-09 (emphasis and footnote omitted). The Soule court concluded that,\n\nin light of precedent, the evidence offered by the plaintiff was not probative of the issue\n\nplaced in dispute (there, ordinary consumer expectations regarding excessive\n\nweakness or porosity in a bracket weld); but, the evidence offered raised an inference of\n\ndefect under the risk-benefit analysis and, therefore, the trial court should have properly\n\nlimited its instructions to the jury to that test. The all-too-common difficulty with the\n\ncommentators’ interpretation of Soule is that the court’s fact-bound evidentiary holding\n\nis taken out of its context, mistaken for establishment of a distinct burden of proof, and\n\ntreated as doctrine. Compare Scampone, 57 A.3d at 606; Gilbert, 327 A.2d at 96-97.\n\n       The Third Restatement also offers a variation upon those tests primarily based\n\nupon a risk-utility determination by requiring proof of a reasonable alternative design.\n\nSee Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 884-87 (explaining standard of proof premised\n\nupon risk-utility balancing and proof of alternative design).       The Third Restatement\n\nstates, in illustrative part:\n\n                       § 1 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for\n               Harm Caused by Defective Products\n                       One engaged in the business of selling or otherwise\n               distributing products who sells or distributes a defective\n               product is subject to liability for harm to persons or property\n               caused by the defect.\n\n\n                       § 2 Categories of Product Defect\n                       A product is defective when, at the time of sale or\n               distribution, it contains a manufacturing defect, is defective in\n               design, or is defective because of inadequate instructions or\n               warnings. A product:\n                       (a) contains a manufacturing defect when the product\n               departs from its intended design even though all possible\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 105\n\f             care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the\n             product;\n                    (b) is defective in design when the foreseeable risks\n             of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or\n             avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design\n             by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the\n             commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the\n             alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe;\n                    (c) is defective because of inadequate instructions or\n             warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the\n             product could have been reduced or avoided by the\n             provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller\n             or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain\n             of distribution, and the omission of the instructions or\n             warnings renders the product not reasonably safe.\n\n\n                     § 3 Circumstantial Evidence Supporting Inference of\n             Product Defect\n                     It may be inferred that the harm sustained by the\n             plaintiff was caused by a product defect existing at the time\n             of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific defect,\n             when the incident that harmed the plaintiff:\n                     (a) was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of\n             product defect; and\n                     (b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of\n             causes other than product defect existing at the time of sale\n             or distribution.\n\n                           *      *       *      *\n\n\nRESTATEMENT (3D)     OF   TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY §§ 1-3 (1998) (Liability Rules\n\nApplicable to Products Generally).\n\n      Section 1 of the Third Restatement articulates the general policy of strict liability.\n\nSections 2 through 4, as well as Sections 6 and 7, address evidentiary questions.\n\nNotably, Section 2 identifies three types of defects and, at least with respect to “design”\n\ndefect (subsection (b)), states a general rule, which defines a defect by reference to the\n\nrelative risk-utility calculi for the allegedly defective product and an alternatively\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 106\n\fdesigned product.     See also Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 888-89 (alternative\n\ndesign is proof of technological feasibility, “an empirical factor for courts to consider in\n\nthe normative process of risk-utility balancing”). Application of this general rule is, as a\n\nresult, limited -- and compensation is available -- only for those products for which an\n\nalternative design can be shown to exist. The Restatement illustrates its view that other\n\nevidence may be probative in a design defect case by articulating special rules. Thus,\n\nSections 3, 4, and comment e to Section 2 of the Third Restatement establish\n\nalternative means for proving a design defect “in circumstances in which common\n\nexperience teaches that an inference of defect may be warranted under the specific\n\nfacts,” where the seller or distributor violates statutory and regulatory norms, and “when\n\nthe product design is manifestly unreasonable.” Meanwhile, Sections 6 and 7 address\n\nspecial rules of liability for specific products: prescription drugs and medical devices,\n\nand food products. See id. at §§ 6-7; see also § 6 cmt. f (Section 6 principle articulates\n\njudgment that liability attaches only when certain type and quantum of evidence is\n\nadduced by plaintiff; noting expectation that, under “this very demanding objective\n\nstandard, liability is likely to be imposed only under unusual circumstances”). In relation\n\nto prescription drugs, for example, the special rule reflects in part an understanding that,\n\nfor some products, there is no alternative design.\n\n\n\n          4.      The Appropriate Post-Azzarello Strict Liability Construct\n\n                     a.     The “Move” to the Third Restatement\n\n       Guided by this decisional and doctrinal universe, we address the parties’\n\ncompeting arguments, which rely, to a great extent, upon jurisprudential and policy\n\nassertions. Initially, from a jurisprudential perspective, Omega Flex argues that the\n\nThird Restatement offers a clearer and more precise articulation of strict liability doctrine\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 107\n\fthan does the Second Restatement, and adoption of the new formulation would return\n\nPennsylvania into the mainstream in this arena. Omega Flex adds that a move to the\n\nThird Restatement is also the next logical step in the evolution of the law given that\n\nseveral Justices of this Court and members of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third\n\nCircuit, in Berrier, have articulated its merits and supported its application.        The\n\nTinchers respond that the Court has yet to “adopt” the Third Restatement and non-\n\nprecedential opinions are not a basis upon which to do so. Of course, non-precedential\n\nexpressions from this Court do not bind us to a course of action, nor do precedential\n\nexpressions of non-binding courts -- what matters is the persuasiveness of the\n\nreasoning and the current decisional context. In particular, the separate expressions of\n\nJustice Saylor have proven invaluable in crystallizing awareness of the difficulties in this\n\narea of law.\n\n       Omega Flex also argues that the Third Restatement is the better articulation of\n\nthe law, one specifically intended to address design defects and representing the\n\nmainstream view on the topic.       According to Omega Flex, the present iteration of\n\nPennsylvania law improperly lowers the burden of proof upon plaintiffs generally.\n\nOmega Flex posits that the Third Restatement, in contrast, is a “closely reasoned and\n\nbalanced approach” that enhances the fairness and efficacy of the liability scheme.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 48 (citing Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1021 (Saylor, J., concurring); Bugosh,\n\n971 A.2d at 1231 (Saylor, J., dissenting); General Services, 898 A.2d at 616 (Newman,\n\nJ., concurring and dissenting)). According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement is\n\nalready widely accepted and, as illustrated by this case, does not place an overly\n\nonerous burden of proof upon plaintiffs.      Finally, Omega Flex claims that the Third\n\nRestatement is not a departure from but a refinement of the Second Restatement,\n\nwhich “simply elevates the availability of a safer alternative design from a factor to be\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 108\n\fconsidered in the risk-utility analysis to a requisite element of a cause of action for\n\ndefective design.” Appellant’s Reply Brief at 17, 21. According to Omega Flex, the\n\nSecond Restatement did not specifically articulate the alternative design requirement\n\nbecause that Restatement “was focused on manufacturing, not design, defects.” Id. at\n\n20.\n\n       The Tinchers respond that the Third Restatement replaces the Second\n\nRestatement liability scheme with a negligence standard, which heightens the plaintiff’s\n\nburden of proof and, as a result, “compromises the deeply-rooted social policy of\n\nprotecting citizens through the imposition of strict liability under [the Second]\n\nRestatement.”     Appellees’ Brief at 23.     The Tinchers do not share Omega Flex’s\n\n“refinement” view of the Third Restatement, but instead describe the iteration as a\n\n“radical departure from established precedent [that] is not prudent or necessary.” Id. at\n\n26. The Tinchers also assert that the Third Restatement has limited support in other\n\njurisdictions. Moreover, the Tinchers claim that the Third Restatement standard will\n\nresult in a denial of compensation for meritorious claims by raising the cost of pursuing\n\nthe claims: “[t]he plaintiff will have to become an expert in the technology that caused\n\nthe plaintiff’s injury, and will need to re-design the product himself.” Id. at 34.\n\n       In essential part, both parties ask this Court to engage questions of whether their\n\npreferred iteration of the Restatement embodies a good, better, or more desirable public\n\npolicy. As we have explained, as an adjudicative body, this Court is not particularly\n\nwell-suited to such a broad task.         The appropriate question is which, if either,\n\nRestatement articulates the standard of proof in terms that effectuate the public policy of\n\nthis Commonwealth.\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we conclude that “adoption” of the Third Restatement\n\napproach is problematic. For one thing, articulating the burden of proof in terms of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 109\n\fevidence (alternative design) deemed probative of the general principle of strict liability\n\nproscriptively limits the applicability of the cause of action to certain products as to\n\nwhich that sort of evidence is available. The approach suggests a priori categorical\n\nexemptions for some products -- such as novel products with no alternative design --\n\nbut not others. The Connecticut Supreme Court suggested a similar insight: “in some\n\ninstances, a product may be in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the\n\nuser even though no feasible alternative design is available.” Potter, 694 A.2d at 1332.\n\n      Of course, the courts, legislatures, and the American Law Institute cannot\n\nforesee all the myriad products and circumstances that may arise.          The alternative\n\nmeans of proving liability in special cases recognized in the Third Restatement are\n\ndesigned to alleviate some of the harsh results of the general rule which are currently\n\nforeseeable, suggesting some limited liability in circumstances in which the special rules\n\nof Sections 2 -- comment e, 3, 4, 6, or 7 apply. Nevertheless, a question remains\n\nwhether the general and special rules taken together state a general principle of liability\n\nconsistent with the public policy that compensation is available for an injury caused by\n\nany type of defective product.     Compare Scampone, 57 A.3d at 606 (rejecting as\n\ninconsistent with negligence public policy nursing home’s argument that nursing home\n\nlacked duty of care to patients because prior decisional law had addressed only\n\nnegligence liability of hospitals and plaintiff had not adduced proof that nursing home\n\noffered same healthcare services as hospital).          In either case, this jurisdiction’s\n\nexperience with the repercussions of attempting to articulate specific principles of\n\nliability of broad application in implementing the strict liability cause of action make us\n\nreticent to go far beyond the necessities of an individual case and embrace a broad new\n\napproach premised upon what may prove to be procrustean categorical restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 110\n\f       Our reticence respecting the Third Restatement scheme is not a judgment on our\n\npart that, as a matter of policy, articulating categorical exemptions from strict liability is\n\nnot a viable or desirable alternative. Courts, which address evidence and arguments in\n\nindividual cases, are neither positioned, nor resourced, to make the kind of policy\n\njudgments required to arrive at an a priori decision as to which individual products, or\n\ncategories and types of products, should be exempt. Neither courts, nor the American\n\nLaw Institute for that matter, are in the business of articulating general principles tailored\n\nto anoint special “winners” and “losers” among those who engage in the same type of\n\nconduct. In our view, the question of “special tort-insulated status” for certain suppliers -\n\n- for example, manufacturers of innovative products with no comparable alternative\n\ndesign -- optimally “requires an assessment and balancing of policies best left to the\n\nGeneral Assembly.” Scampone, 57 A.3d at 599; Ayala, supra; but see, e.g., Hahn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052785\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052785/hahn-v-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (where adequacy of warnings associated with prescription drugs is at issue,\n\nstrict liability is not recognized as basis for liability). As we explained in Scampone:\n\n                     Immunity or exemption from liability is the exception\n              to the general rule that an entity must meet the obligations it\n              incurs in functioning. . . . [A]ny other cause of action at\n              common law. . . evolves through either directly applicable\n              decisional law or by analogy, meaning that a defendant is\n              not categorically exempt from liability simply because\n              appellate decisional law has not specifically addressed a\n              theory of liability in a particular context.         Categorical\n              exemptions from liability exist (following the dismantling by\n              this Court of judicial immunities in the 1960s and 1970s) only\n              where the General Assembly has acted to create explicit\n              policy-based immunities, e.g., to protect the public purse.\n              Where either no immunity exists, or the legislative branch\n              created exceptions to an immunity legislatively conferred,\n              the default general rule of possible liability operates.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 111\n\fScampone, 57 A.3d at 599 (also explaining, inter alia, that from judicial perspective,\n\nduty at law is independent of financial status of individual defendants or of particular\n\nindustries).\n\n       The methodology employed by the reporters suggests additional potential\n\nweaknesses in the strict liability schemata of the Third Restatement that should caution\n\ncourts against categorical pronouncements. Citing representative cases from several\n\njurisdictions, the reporters offer that an alternative-design driven risk-utility general rule -\n\n- with a special consumer expectations rule for cases in which the design defect is\n\ndemonstrable -- reflects the consensus among American jurisdictions as to the\n\napplicable liability construct in “classic design cases.” See Henderson, 83 Cornell L.\n\nRev. at 887-901.      Notably, while recognizing that “tort cases are particularly fact-\n\nsensitive,” the reporters purported to undertake an “empirical study of case law” to\n\ndetermine whether the alternative-design driven risk-utility general rule has support in\n\nthe decisional law in a majority of jurisdictions. The reporters commented that: “[t]ort\n\ncases are particularly fact-sensitive and courts are consequently prone to pepper their\n\ndecisions with dicta and footnotes to allow ‘wiggle room’ for cases that may arise in the\n\nfuture. In contrast to legal treatise writers and restaters who, in synthesizing the law,\n\ntend to speak precisely and categorically, courts in their published opinions are more\n\nlikely to be open-textured and indecisive.” Id. at 888. This approach no doubt fulfills the\n\nrole of the American Law Institute in its own salutary task of restating and clarifying a\n\nview of strict liability that can be reduced to decisive terms. We also respect the effort\n\nof the Third Restatement reporters in approaching that non-judicial task practically and\n\nwith humility.    But, what drives the Institute and treatise writers does not make\n\ncomparative modesty, nuance, and reticence in the judiciary mistaken (much less\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 112\n\findecisive) in a jurisdiction, like Pennsylvania, where the area, to date, has been the\n\nexclusive province of the common law.\n\n       That evidence of the existence and specifications of an alternative design is\n\nrelevant and even highly probative to prove disputed issues in a products liability case,\n\nsuch as technological feasibility, cost, etc., is certainly true. That the more typical case\n\nimplicates the type of products and circumstances in which evidence of an alternative\n\nproduct design is the most persuasive and efficient means of convincing the trier of fact\n\nmay also be true. That offering evidence of an alternative product design may be the\n\npreferred legal strategy of the plaintiff’s bar in certain cases -- or may be a strategy the\n\ndefense bar would like to impose on the plaintiff’s bar in certain cases -- again may also\n\nbe true. But, while the reporters’ intuition that meritorious cases are premised upon\n\ncertain types of evidence may have some general validity and support in practice (and\n\nmay prove helpful to litigants in articulating claims and preparing defenses), the\n\nreporters’ commentary candidly betrays a problem -- for the judiciary at least -- of\n\nperspective. Principally, at least in a climate where suggestions are made along the\n\nlines of simply “adopting” or “moving to” a Restatement construct, it is our view that the\n\nreporters’ “precise and categorical” perspective insufficiently accounts for the\n\nimperatives of the courts’ more modest decisional role, by, for example, describing the\n\nreasoned and purposeful articulation of general principles as “dicta.”\n\n       As a jurisprudential matter, articulating common law principles in terms of\n\nextrapolations from evidence relevant in the typical case is problematic for good\n\nreasons. It is worth reiterating that:\n\n                    [T]his Court’s decisions are read against the facts\n              because “our decisional law generally develops\n              incrementally, within the confines of the circumstances of\n              cases as they come before the Court. For one thing, it is\n              very difficult for courts to determine the range of factual\n\n\n                                         [J-80-2013] - 113\n\f              circumstances to which a particular rule should apply in light\n              of the often myriad possibilities.” [Maloney, 984 A.2d at 489-\n              90.] Depending on the perspective of the Court, prospective\n              or retrospective, this insight has separate but related\n              implications.     Prospectively, we endeavor to render\n              determinations that “spring [ ] from the facts before us in\n              th[e] appeal, while recognizing that our task is not simply to\n              decide this case, but also to provide guidance upon the\n              broader legal issue,” especially where the issue is one of first\n              impression. “By necessity, this undertaking requires breadth\n              of vision and consideration of both sides of the coin: the\n              facts of a given case on one side, and the law, which will\n              almost always be more conceptual, on the other.”\n              [Thierfelder v.

As a practical matter, courts articulate\n\ngeneral principles -- what the Restatement reporters may in some instances call “dicta” -\n\n- before applying them to the facts in order to place a set a facts in perspective, to\n\nexplain and ground the disposition.      This is because, at its best, decisional law is\n\nprinciple-driven and not result-driven (although just results are certainly the overarching\n\ngoal).   And, a reasoned decision will always permit easy or intuitive drafting and\n\nexplication of the relevant principles. Candid decision-making articulates governing,\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 114\n\fand occasionally competing principles, and has the flexibility to reassess a prior\n\nprinciple upon confrontation with nuance, better or different advocacy, or articulation of\n\na previously unperceived principle of salutary value.\n\n       Insight into the reporters’ perspective on how the nature of decisions at common\n\nlaw informs their consensus effort to speak otherwise, i.e., to “speak precisely and\n\ncategorically” by classifying defect claims (i.e., classic design cases, prescription drugs\n\ncases, etc.) and inserting evidentiary prerequisites into general and special rules\n\napplicable to the distinct categories to which they pertain, should serve as a reminder of\n\ncomparative judicial modesty. The Third Restatement approach presumes too much\n\ncertainty about the range of circumstances, factual or otherwise, to which the “general\n\nrule” articulated should apply.\n\n       Indeed, relying upon a confined universe of reported appellate cases to draw\n\nevidence-based (versus principle-based) rules is problematic as a general matter in our\n\nmature legal system. This is so because the small class of cases posing issues of\n\nsufficient consequence to result in reported, precedential decisions naturally tends to\n\nraise narrow unsettled issues and / or fact-sensitive applications, rather than to provide\n\nvehicles to illustrate those parts of the law that are so “well accepted” as to reflect\n\nemergent general rules.      Of course, these cases may, by analogy and distinction,\n\nilluminate general principles at issue; but, purporting to limit the general rule to the facts\n\nof those cases is anathema to the common law. Stated otherwise, simply because in\n\ncases of factually-marginal applications courts have found evidence relating to\n\nalternative designs to be particularly probative and persuasive, in our minds, does not\n\nnecessarily support a thesis that adducing such evidence is dispositive of whether a\n\nplaintiff has carried his / her burden of proof. See, e.g., Soule, 882 P.2d at 308. The\n\nprincipal point is that a jurisdiction is free to adopt a policy that reduces a supplier’s\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 115\n\fexposure to strict liability for a product. But, it would either be naïve or inaccurate to\n\ndeclare that existing decisional law in Pennsylvania expressly articulates, or\n\ncontemplates, only the general principle in the terms of the Third Restatement. And, if\n\nadopted as a broadly applicable legal regime, the Third Restatement would engender a\n\nself-fulfilling prophecy by providing for a future restatement, going forward, of only those\n\ncases that meet the evidentiary threshold the regime permits.\n\n       Additionally, the Third Restatement construct, because unmoored from guidance\n\nupon the broader legal issue, would likely impede the principled development of the law\n\nin this arena.   Although “[b]right lines and broad rules always offer a superficially\n\nenticing option,” they also risk elevating the lull of simplicity to doctrine. See, e.g.,\n\nScampone, 57 A.3d at 598; Azzarello.          And, finally, our reticence respecting broad\n\napproval of the Third Restatement is separately explainable by looking no further than\n\nto the aftermath of Azzarello, whose negligence rhetoric-related doctrinal proscription\n\narising from a peculiar set of circumstances had long-term deleterious effects on the\n\ndevelopment of strict liability law in Pennsylvania. Azzarello and Scampone illustrate, in\n\ndifferent ways, how dogmatic pronouncements are difficult to apply in individual cases\n\nwithout guidance upon the broader legal issue and the result is often that litigation will\n\nderail into irrelevant, unreasoned, or unprincipled factual disputes (an issue to which we\n\nalso adverted in our discussion of Soule, supra). As a Court, in this dynamic area, we\n\nmust settle for the incremental approach.24\n\n24\n       Commentary by Dean Wade and Dean W. Page Keeton of the University of\nTexas offered related approaches to the standard of proof in design defect cases\npremised upon imputation of knowledge of risks when such knowledge was unavailable\nprior to marketing. Although offering invaluable insight, an imputation of knowledge\napproach has not gained substantial traction because of difficulties identified by the\nauthors themselves. See generally John W. Wade, THE PASSAGE OF TIME: THE\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY: ON THE EFFECT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE\nUNAVAILABLE PRIOR TO MARKETING, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 734 (1983).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 116\n\f       Our previous analysis illustrates that the Third Restatement does not offer an\n\narticulation of the law sufficient to persuade us to simply abandon the Second\n\nRestatement formulation of the strict products liability cause of action and “move” to the\n\nThird Restatement.       Unlike the Third Restatement, we believe that the Second\n\nRestatement already adopted, and properly calibrated, permits the plaintiffs to tailor\n\ntheir factual allegations and legal argumentation to the circumstances as they present\n\nthemselves in the real-world crucible of litigation, rather than relying upon an evidence-\n\nbound standard of proof.\n\n\n\n                           b.     Prevailing Standard of Proof\n\n       Having overruled Azzarello and declined the invitation to fill the void by simply\n\n“adopting” the Third Restatement formulation, we proceed to address the appropriate\n\nstandard of proof of a strict liability claim in Pennsylvania.\n\n       Initially, we note that, although Pennsylvania remains a Second Restatement\n\njurisdiction, “adoption” of its principles into our common law is distinct in concept and\n\napplication from the adoption of a statute by the General Assembly.             Although the\n\nreporter’s words have intrinsic significance because their purpose is to explain the legal\n\nprinciple clearly, they are not entitled to the fidelity due a legislative body’s expression of\n\npolicy, whose judgment and intent, wise or unwise, a court generally is obligated to\n\neffectuate, absent constitutional infirmity. The language of a restatement, as a result, is\n\nnot necessarily susceptible to “statutory”-type construction or parsing. An effective and\n\nvaluable restatement of the law offers instead a pithy articulation of a principle of law\n\nwhich, in many cases, including novel or difficult ones, represents a starting template for\n\nmembers of the judiciary, whose duty is then to employ an educated, candid, and\n\ncommon-sense approach to ensure dispensation of justice to the citizenry.                 The\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 117\n\fcommon law relies in individual cases upon clear iterations of the facts and skillful\n\nadvocacy, and evolves in principle by analogy, distinction, and reasoned explication.\n\nAccord Scampone, 57 A.3d at 605. This is the essence of justice at common law.\n\n       With this qualification in mind, we explain: (1) that the strict liability cause of\n\naction sounds in tort; (2) that the notion of “defective condition unreasonably dangerous”\n\nis the normative principle of the strict liability cause of action, which reflects the standard\n\nof review or application of the tort, and its history; and (3) the appropriate interplay of\n\nprinciple and evidence.25\n\n       It is important to remember that the action sounds in tort, i.e. the cause involves\n\nbreach of duties “imposed by law as a matter of social policy,” rather than contract, i.e.,\n\nthe cause involves breach of duties “imposed by mutual consensus agreements\n\nbetween particular individuals.” Ash, 932 A.2d at 884; see RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS\n\n§ 402A(2). Nevertheless, the tortious conduct at issue is not the same as that found in\n\ntraditional claims of negligence and commonly associated with the more colloquial\n\nnotion of “fault.”   In this sense, introducing a colloquial notion of “fault” into the\n\nconversation relating to strict product liability in tort detracts from the precision required\n\nto keep this legal proposition within rational bounds.26\n\n25\n         While the Second Restatement formulation of the principles governing the strict\nliability cause of action in tort may have proven substantially less than clear, the policy\nthat formulation embodies has not been challenged here and has largely remained\nuncontroverted. Accord Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 868 (premised upon survey of\ndecisional law, noting rejection of “extreme positions that question the need to develop\na general standard for defective design,” such as absolute liability and no strict liability\n(“defer[ing] responsibility for design choices exclusively to the market”), as unnecessary\n“tilting at windmills”).\n\n26\n         But see Sherk, 450 A.2d at 621 (equating liability without proof of negligence,\ni.e., breach of duty of care, to liability without fault). Consider a counterexample of tort\nliability without fault and its reasoned justification.

To maintain the integrity and fairness of the strict products\n\nliability cause of action, each part of this standard of proof remains subject to its\n\ntheoretical limitations, as explained above.       We believe that the demands of strict\n\nliability policy are met because the composite standard retains the best functioning\n\nfeatures of each test, when applied in the appropriate factual context.

This is an expensive,\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 120\n\f       The emergent single cause of action in tort -- strict liability -- retained,\n\nnevertheless, those aspects of negligence and breach of warranty liability theories from\n\nwhich it evolved. Stated otherwise, the theory of strict liability as it evolved overlaps in\n\neffect with the theories of negligence and breach of warranty. (Parenthetically, this\n\nplaces into context Section 402A(2), which states that the rule of strict liability “applies\n\nalthough (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his\n\nproduct, and (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into\n\nany contractual relation with the seller.”). As we explained above, this is not an unusual\n\ndevelopment in the common law: for example, negligence and strict liability for\n\nabnormally dangerous activities also overlap in the sense that they both are premised\n\nupon a risk-utility hindsight analysis with different public policy overlays to modify their\n\napplication to distinct conduct. Relevant here, public policy also adjusts expectations of\n\nefficiency and intuitions of justice considerations in the context of products liability,\n\ninforming a seller’s conduct toward consumers as a group and ensuring compensation\n\nin individual cases by judicial application of the strict liability cause of action.\n\nEssentially, strict liability is a theory that effectuates a further shift of the risk of harm\n\nonto the supplier than either negligence or breach of warranty theory by combining the\n\nbalancing of interests inherent in those two causes of action.\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\n            time-consuming, and wasteful process, and it may be\n            interrupted by insolvency, lack of jurisdiction, disclaimers, or\n            the statute of limitations, anywhere along the line.

The Barker Court thus articulated a standard of proof\n\nwhich stated the consumer expectations test and the risk-utility test in the alternative.\n\nThe alternative test standard of proof is a “composite” that retains “the most workable\n\nfeatures of each of the other tests.” Caterpillar, 593 P.2d at 884-85.\n\n       One other insight completes the picture: a duality in the strict liability cause of\n\naction is evident in the expectation that all sellers in the distributive chain are legally\n\nresponsible for the product in strict liability.    Dean Prosser explained the expected\n\nresults of applying strict liability:\n\n                      Where the action is against the manufacturer of the\n               product, an honest estimate might very well be that there is\n               not one case in a hundred in which strict liability would result\n               in recovery where negligence does not. . . . All this,\n               however, is but half of the picture. There are other sellers\n               than the manufacturer of the product. It will pass through the\n               hands of a whole line of other dealers, and the plaintiff may\n               have good reason to sue any or all of them. . . . It is here\n               that negligence liability breaks down. The wholesaler, the\n               jobber, and the retailer normally are simply not negligent.\n               They are under no duty to test or inspect the chattel, and\n               they do not do so; and when, as is usually the case today, it\n               comes to them in a sealed container, examination becomes\n               impossible without destroying marketability. No inference of\n               negligence can arise against these sellers, and res ipsa\n               loquitur is of no use at all.\nProsser, 69 Yale L. J. at 1116-17 (footnote omitted).\n\n       Thus, in placing a product on the market, a manufacturer acts to design (and\n\nmanufacture) the product and, along with other distributors, to sell the product, including\n\nmaking the product attractive for sale by making implicit representations of the product’s\n\nsafety.

Essentially, given that a term like “defective condition unreasonably\n\ndangerous” is not self-defining, courts have offered multiple definitions applicable in the\n\nseveral contexts in which a definitional issue has arisen, all effectuating the single policy\n\nthat those who sell a product are held responsible for damages caused to a consumer\n\nby the reasonable use of the product. See, e.g., Miller, 221 A.2d at 334-35 (Jones, J.,\n\nconcurring and dissenting); accord Barker, 573 P.2d at 453 (“term defect as utilized in\n\nthe strict liability context is neither self-defining nor susceptible to a single definition\n\napplicable in all contexts”). The exposition of strict liability in Pennsylvania and in other\n\njurisdictions illustrates that the original disputes implicated tensions over how warranty\n\nprinciples limited liability on a strict liability in tort theory. Decisional law that derived\n\nfrom the tension reflected a period of expanding liability (because plaintiffs were not\n\nrequired to prove privity as in a breach of warranty action, see, e.g., Miller). These\n\ntypes of disputes waned as the law settled in, both by way of decisional law discarding\n\nprivity in breach of warranty cases and by clarification of this part of the law in the late\n\n1960s and early 1970s, which may have aided suppliers to internalize the effects of\n\nwarranty-type strict liability into their conduct and to pass the attendant costs on to\n\nconsumers. In a sense, then, the consumer expectations gauge for strict liability has\n\nhad some apparent success in vindicating the policy of strict liability.\n\n       Modern decisional law reflects that the focus of disputes -- or at least those\n\ndisputes making their way into the appellate courts -- has increasingly been upon the\n\nnegligence-derived risk-utility alternative formulation of the standard. The prominence\n\nof the legal issue in decisional law coincides with the advent of design defect claims, in\n\nwhich issues of proof tend to more complexity than where a manufacturing defect is in\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 124\n\fdispute. This development reflected the complex litigation calculus implicated in a strict\n\nliability claim premised upon this type of defect resulting from either lack of proof (for\n\nexample in the case of known or foreseeable risks for which an available cure may or\n\nmay not have been available at the time of design) or the relative deterrent inefficacy of\n\na theory of liability for unknowable risks, short of exiting the market. Accord Prosser, 69\n\nYale L. J. at 1116 (“So long as there is the possibility that negligence may not be found,\n\nthe defendant is encouraged by vain hopes, and the plaintiff gnawed by lingering\n\ndoubts; and a case which can be decided for the defendant is worth less, in terms of\n\nsettlement, than one which can not.       And so long as the defendant can introduce\n\nevidence of his own due care, the possibility remains that it may influence the size of\n\nthe verdict, as jurymen impressed with it stubbornly hold out for no liability, or a smaller\n\nsum.”) (emphasis omitted). Yet, some types of disputes are absent from the decisional\n\nlaw and may, indeed, provide rather strong evidence of strict liability as a deterrent by\n\npreventing bringing a product to market or encouraging settlement of claims -- it must\n\nbe remembered that an appellate expression is not necessary to illustrate the point that\n\ndesigners are properly deterred by strict liability from using consumers as guinea pigs.\n\nSee Henderson, 83 Cornell L. Rev. at 901 (“Some courts, in dicta, hold out the\n\npossibility that the risk-utility imbalance might be so egregious that the product should\n\nnot be marketed at all.

Derived from its negligence-warranty dichotomy,\n\nthe strict liability cause of action theoretically permits compensation where harm results\n\nfrom risks that are known or foreseeable (although proof of either may be unavailable) --\n\na circumstance similar to cases in which traditional negligence theory is implicated --\n\nand also where harm results from risks unknowable at the time of manufacture or sale --\n\na circumstance similar to cases in which traditional implied warranty theory is\n\nimplicated. The difficulty is in cabining liability premised upon a risk unknowable at the\n\ntime of manufacture / sale, which was logically unavoidable, in circumstances in which\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 126\n\fliability and attendant compensation was potentially limitless (in other words, 100\n\npercent of risk would be shifted to suppliers). Imputing knowledge, and assessing the\n\navoidability of risk -- was theoretically counterintuitive and offered practical difficulties,\n\nas illustrated by the Wade-Keeton debate. See generally John W. Wade, THE PASSAGE\n\nOF TIME: THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY: ON THE EFFECT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY OF\n\nKNOWLEDGE UNAVAILABLE PRIOR        TO   MARKETING, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 734 (1983). Both\n\nrationing and policy -- as expressed in the qualification “unreasonably dangerous” --\n\nsupported limitations.    The risk-utility calculus has been suggested as a normative\n\nsolution to cabin liability exposure regardless of the type of claim asserted (i.e., of either\n\na known / foreseeable or an unknown risk). Accord Beard, 41 A.3d at 838 (meaningful\n\nrisk-utility evaluation is effort to implement rational limits on strict liability in tort).\n\nBecause the circumstance is not before us, and in light of the complexities and dearth of\n\npersuasive authority, we will await the appropriate case to speak definitively to this\n\nissue.\n\n         By comparison, the Tinchers’ claim was essentially premised upon the allegation\n\nthat the risk of harm related to TracPipe’s thickness was both foreseeable and\n\navoidable, as illustrated by the resistance to lightning of black iron pipe.           These\n\nallegations, at least, bear the indicia of negligence. Indeed, in some respects this is the\n\n“typical” case, which explains both the insight that in design cases, the character of the\n\nproduct and the conduct of the manufacturer are largely inseparable, and the Third\n\nRestatement’s approach of requiring an alternative design as part of the standard of\n\nproof. See, e.g., Phillips, 841 A.2d at 1013-14 (Saylor, J., concurring); Henderson, 83\n\nCornell L. Rev. at 876-87 (“Developing a General Defectiveness Standard for Classic\n\nDesign Cases”). Indeed, the Tinchers themselves sought summary relief and dismissal\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 127\n\fof this case premised upon the argument that the same result would have obtained\n\nunder either the Second or the Third Restatement iteration of the law.\n\n       But, the point that we have stressed repeatedly in this Opinion, is that courts do\n\nnot try the “typical” products case exclusively and a principle of the common law must\n\npermit just application to myriad factual circumstances that are beyond our power to\n\nconceive. Circumstances like product diversity, general uncertainties inherent in the\n\ncreative process, difficulties in recreating the design process, difficulties in the discovery\n\nprocess, to name just a few, may contribute to whether cases other than the typical\n\ncase will generate a dispute and resulting decisional precedent. Nevertheless, in many\n\ncircumstances, courts may be called upon to examine whether the rule has outrun the\n\nreason. Self-selection of cases (consumers and manufacturers internalizing the policy\n\nvindicated by the strict liability theory and modifying conduct as a result), variations in\n\nthe quality and nuance in competing argumentation from counsel, including in the\n\nfashioning of suggested jury charges applicable to a particular case, courts’ articulation\n\nof relevant normative principles as they pertain to specific factual scenarios, and\n\nscholarly commentary will likely contribute to the continually developing decisional law.\n\n       The delivery of justice in this area requires a recognition and appreciation of the\n\nappropriate and significant roles played by advocates, trial judges, and the appellate\n\njudiciary. Particularly relevant here, we note that the area of strict liability law remains\n\ncomplex and our decision here does not purport to foresee and account for the myriad\n\nimplications or potential pitfalls as yet unarticulated or unappreciated. Thus, at the trial\n\nlevel, and as with other legal concepts, “it is incumbent upon the parties, through their\n\nattorneys, to aid courts in narrowing issues and formulating appropriate instructions to\n\nguide juries in their factual determinations. . . .” It is worth reiterating that “[b]right lines\n\nand broad rules always offer a superficially enticing option.            However, we cannot\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-80-2013] - 128\n\felevate the lull of simplicity over the balancing of interests embodied by the principles\n\nunderpinning [the jurisprudence of the relevant area of law].” Scampone, 57 A.3d at\n\n598. The principal point is that judicial modesty counsels that we be content to permit\n\nthe common law to develop incrementally, as we provide reasoned explications of\n\nprinciples pertinent to factual circumstances of the cases that come before the Court.\n\nSee Scampone, 57 A.3d at 605; Barker, 573 P.2d at 453 (difficulties inherent in giving\n\ncontent to defectiveness standard “could best be resolved by resort to the ‘cluster of\n\nuseful precedents’ which have been developed in the product liability field. . . .”).\n\n\n\n                   5.     Litigation Considerations Deriving from the\n\n                              New Strict Liability Construct\n\n                        a.     Judge and Jury; Jury Instructions\n\n        Having outlined these principles of strict liability law, we next offer the following\n\nguidance relating to the appropriate provinces of the judge and jury, and to adequate,\n\ntargeted jury instructions in a strict liability case. As noted, the Azzarello Court held\n\nthat, as a gauge for whether a product is unreasonably dangerous, the balancing of\n\nrisks and utilities, when implicated, was an issue of law dependent upon social policy to\n\nbe decided by the trial court. The jury would then simply resolve any “dispute as to the\n\ncondition of a product,” as a separate question.         391 A.2d at 1025-27.      We have\n\nexplained why we believe that severing findings relating to the risk-utility calculus from\n\nfindings related to the condition of the product is impracticable and inconsistent with the\n\ntheory of strict liability. We offer additional guidance to confirm our departure from that\n\naspect of Azzarello that assigned these roles to the judge and jury in a strict liability\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 129\n\f       As is generally the case, the plaintiff is the master of the claim in the first\n\ninstance. The immediate implication is that counsel must articulate the plaintiff’s strict\n\nliability claim by alleging sufficient facts to make a prima facie case premised upon\n\neither a “consumer expectations” or “risk-utility” theory, or both. The calculus for a\n\nplaintiff and a plaintiff’s advocate in choosing to pursue either theory or both will likely\n\naccount, among other things, for the nature of the product, for the theoretical limitations\n\nof either alternative standard of proof, for whether pursuing both theories simultaneously\n\nis likely to confuse the finder of fact and, most importantly, for the evidence available or\n\nlikely to become available for trial. As discovery and case preparation proceed, and the\n\nevidentiary record evolves, the plaintiff may choose to pursue or abandon either theory,\n\nor pursue both, if the evidence so warrants.        A defendant may also seek to have\n\ndismissed any overreaching by the plaintiff via appropriate motion and objection. The\n\ntrial court is to act in its ordinary gate-keeper role, e.g., monitoring litigation, mediating\n\nor adjudicating any subsidiary differences, and pending objections and motions,\n\nincluding those seeking to narrow, or expand, the theories of litigation to be pursued at\n\ntrial. See, e.g., Soule, 882 P.2d at 303, 309.29\n\n29\n        For example, in Soule, the trial court gave the standard two-prong Barker\ninstruction for design defect without modification, over the defendant-manufacturer’s\nobjection. The defendant argued that, given the nature of the product, instructing the\njury on the consumer expectations standard was error. On appeal, the Supreme Court\nof California agreed:\n\n                   [T]he jury may not be left free to find a violation of\n            ordinary consumer expectations whenever it chooses.\n            Unless the facts actually permit an inference that the\n            product’s performance did not meet the minimum safety\n            expectations of its ordinary users, the jury must engage in\n            the balancing of risks and benefits required by the second\n            prong of Barker.        Accordingly, as Barker indicated,\n            instructions are misleading and incorrect if they allow a jury\n(continuedQ)\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 130\n\f       One crucial aspect of the trial court’s role is, of course, the task of defining the\n\nstrict liability legal universe within which a particular jury operates for purposes of\n\ndischarging its function.

See N.T., 10/19/2010, at 794-98.\n\nWe have now overruled Azzarello and we have additionally explained foundational\n\nissues related to the strict liability cause of action in Pennsylvania -- the public policy\n\nwhich the cause of action vindicates, the duty recognized by the public policy, and the\n\nstandard and burden of proof necessary to prove breach that duty. Going forward,\n\nconsistent with this decision, when a plaintiff proceeds on a theory that implicates a risk-\n\nutility calculus, proof of risks and utilities are part of the burden to prove that the harm\n\nsuffered was due to the defective condition of the product. The credibility of witnesses\n\nand testimony offered, the weight of evidence relevant to the risk-utility calculus, and\n\nwhether a party has met the burden to prove the elements of the strict liability cause of\n\n\n(Qcontinued)\n            to avoid this risk-benefit analysis in a case where it is\n            required. Instructions based on the ordinary consumer\n            expectations prong of Barker are not appropriate where, as a\n            matter of law, the evidence would not support a jury verdict\n            on that theory. Whenever that is so, the jury must be\n            instructed solely on the alternative risk-benefit theory of\n            design defect announced in Barker.\n\n882 P.2d at 303, 309.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 131\n\faction are issues for the finder of fact, whether that finder of fact is judge or jury. A\n\nquestion of whether the party has met its burden of proof is properly “removed” -- for\n\nexample, via adjudication of a dispositive motion -- “from the jury’s consideration only\n\nwhere it is clear that reasonable minds [cannot] differ on the issue.” Hamil v.

Thus, the strict liability construct we articulate\n\ntoday comfortably accommodates the gate-keeping role ordinarily relegated to the trial\n\ncourt in tort actions.\n\n       Our decision today allows for application of standards of proof in the alternative.\n\nObviously, other examples of such decisional paradigms exist. See, e.g., 18 Pa.C.S. §\n\n2503 (describing offense of voluntary manslaughter as action under heat of passion or\n\npremised upon imperfect belief of self-defense). In charging the jury, the trial court’s\n\nobjective is “to explain to the jury how it should approach its task and the factors it\n\nshould consider in reaching its verdict.”         Chambers, 980 A.2d at 49 (quoting\n\nCommonwealth v.

At that point, “[t]he trial court has broad discretion in phrasing its\n\ninstructions, and may choose its own wording so long as the law is clearly, adequately,\n\nand accurately presented to the jury for its consideration.” Sepulveda, 55 A.3d at 1141.\n\n       It is essential for the bench and bar to recognize that the test we articulate today\n\nis not intended as a rigid formula to be offered to the jury in all situations. The alternate\n\ntheories of proof contour the notion of “defective condition” in principled terms intended\n\nas comprehensive guidelines that are sufficiently malleable to account for product\n\ndiversity and a variety of legal claims, products, and applications of theory. The crucial\n\nrole of the trial court is to prepare a jury charge that explicates the meaning of “defective\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 132\n\fcondition” within the boundaries of the law, i.e., the alternative test standard, and the\n\nfacts that pertain. Cf. Soule, 882 P.2d at 308-11.\n\n\n\n                              b.     The Burden of Proof\n\n       Another consideration derived from existing precedent implicates the burden of\n\nproof in a strict liability case. As we have noted, California pioneered the alternate\n\nconsumer expectations / risk-utility balancing test as a prevailing standard of proof in\n\nstrict liability cases. See Barker, 573 P.2d at 457-58. The Barker court also concluded\n\nthat it was appropriate, when proceeding upon a risk-utility theory, to shift to the\n\ndefendant the burden of production and persuasion to demonstrate that an injury-\n\nproducing product is not defective in design.        Id. at 455.    Other jurisdictions have\n\nsubscribed to the Barker standard of proof, although only some of those courts have\n\nalso shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. Compare, e.g., Lamkin v. Towner,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2168121\"><a href=\"/opinion/2168121/lamkin-v-towner/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 457 (Ill. 1990) with Knitz, 432 N.E.2d at 818. The similarity of the\n\napproach we have approved to the Barker standard of proof may raise a question of\n\nwhether Pennsylvania should also require a shifting of the burden of proof to the\n\ndefendant when the plaintiff proceeds upon a risk-utility theory.\n\n       Recently, in a case involving criminal law, this Court explained that: “[t]he\n\nfunction of a standard of proof, as that concept is embodied in the Due Process Clause\n\nand in the realm of factfinding, is to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of\n\nconfidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions\n\nfor a particular type of adjudication. While the risk of error in a particular adjudication\n\ndoes not vary depending on the standard of proof adopted, the burden allocates that\n\nrisk between the parties.” Sanchez, 36 A.3d at 65 (citations omitted). In strict liability\n\ncases, as ordinarily in other civil actions, the burden of proof is sustained by a\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-80-2013] - 133\n\fpreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., Summers v. Certainteed Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1542665\"><a href=\"/opinion/1542665/summers-v-certainteed-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1163-64 (Pa. 2010) (quoting Hamil, 392 A.2d at 1284-85). A more stringent\n\nburden of production and persuasion imposes a higher risk of an erroneous decision on\n\nthe party upon which the burden rests.        Thus, shifting the burden of proof onto a\n\ndefendant places the risk of an erroneous decision upon the defendant.                  The\n\ndetermination of whether such a shift is suitable rests, as the Barker court also noted,\n\nprimarily on considerations of whether the shift vindicates the public policy at issue. In\n\naddition, we consider difficulties of adducing evidence to prove a negative, the parties’\n\nrelative access to evidence, and whether placing the burden of proof on one party is\n\nnecessary to help enforce a further right, constitutional or otherwise. See Sanchez, 36\n\nA.3d at 67.\n\n       Applying similar criteria, the Barker court reasoned that placing the burden on the\n\ndefendant was appropriate “[b]ecause most of the evidentiary matters which may be\n\nrelevant to the determination of the adequacy of a product’s design under the ‘risk-\n\nbenefit’ standard e.g., the feasibility and cost of alternative designs are similar to issues\n\ntypically presented in a negligent design case and involve technical matters peculiarly\n\nwithin the knowledge of the manufacturer.” According to Barker, the shift in the burden\n\nof proof reflected the policy judgment that “one of the principal purposes behind the\n\nstrict product liability doctrine is to relieve an injured plaintiff of many of the onerous\n\nevidentiary burdens inherent in a negligence cause of action.” 573 P.2d at 455.\n\n       The parties obviously have not briefed the question of burden-shifting in risk-\n\nutility cases -- they had no reason to -- and we need not decide it to resolve this appeal,\n\nnor is it apparent that it will matter upon remand.      We note, however, that whatever\n\nmay be the merit of the Barker court’s concerns, countervailing considerations may also\n\nbe relevant. For example, it is consistent with the treatment of tort causes of action\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 134\n\fgenerally, and the notion that Pennsylvania does not presume a product to be defective\n\nuntil proven otherwise, to assign the burden of proof in a strict liability case to the\n\nplaintiff. Moreover, proving a negative is generally not desirable as a jurisprudential\n\nmatter because of fairness concerns related to anticipating and rebutting allegations,\n\nand because of the encumbrances placed upon the judicial system by an open-ended\n\napproach to pleading and trying a case. Finally, evidence relevant to a risk-utility test,\n\nincluding the feasibility and cost of alternative designs, while involving technical matters,\n\nwould seem to be within the knowledge of expert witnesses available to either plaintiff or\n\ndefendant in many cases; and liberal discovery may also aid the plaintiff.\n\n       These interests, and others that we may not perceive, are implicated in\n\nanswering the question of whether the burden should be on the plaintiff or on the\n\ndefendant, generally or in particular cases involving a risk-utility theory. The ultimate\n\nanswer to the question best awaits balancing in an appropriate case, specifically raising\n\nthe question, with attendant briefing from parties.\n\n\n\n                               c.     Related Legal Issues\n\n       We recognize – and the bench and bar should recognize -- that the decision to\n\noverrule Azzarello and articulate a standard of proof premised upon alternative tests in\n\nrelation to claims of a product defective in design may have an impact upon other\n\nfoundational issues regarding manufacturing or warning claims, and upon subsidiary\n\nissues constructed from Azzarello, such as the availability of negligence-derived\n\ndefenses, bystander compensation, or the proper application of the intended use\n\ndoctrine. Accord Bugosh, 971 A.2d at 1244-45 & 1248-49. These considerations and\n\neffects are outside the scope of the facts of this dispute and, understandably, have not\n\nbeen briefed by the Tinchers or Omega Flex.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 135\n\f       This Opinion does not purport to either approve or disapprove prior decisional\n\nlaw, or available alternatives suggested by commentators or the Restatements, relating\n\nto foundational or subsidiary considerations and consequences of our explicit holdings.\n\nIn light of our prior discussion, the difficulties that justify our restraint should be readily\n\napparent.   The common law regarding these related considerations should develop\n\nwithin the proper factual contexts against the background of targeted advocacy.\n\n\n\n                               IV.    Conclusion / Mandate\n\n       At the Court’s request, the parties briefed a question concerning whether\n\nadoption of the Third Restatement, if such a decision were to be made, would have\n\nretroactive or prospective effect. Having declined to “adopt” the Third Restatement, we\n\nneed not reach the question of retroactive or prospective application of the ruling.\n\nNevertheless, in light of the decision to overrule Azzarello, questions remain regarding\n\nwhether Omega Flex should benefit from the application of our Opinion upon remand\n\nand, moreover, whether Omega Flex is entitled to a new trial.            Here, Omega Flex\n\npreserved and presented its claim that Azzarello should be overruled to the trial court\n\nand on appeal; as a result, we hold that Omega Flex is entitled to the benefit of our\n\ndecision in this regard. Whether Omega Flex is entitled to additional relief, including a\n\nnew trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not apparent upon the record before\n\nus.   See Price, 735 A.2d at 672 (new trial appropriate if erroneous jury instruction\n\namounts to fundamental error or the record is insufficient to determine whether error\n\naffected verdict); Degenhardt, 669 A.2d at 950 (judgment notwithstanding verdict is\n\nappropriate only if no two reasonable minds could disagree that verdict should be in\n\nfavor of movant).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-80-2013] - 136\n\f       For these reasons, we reverse in part the decision of the Superior Court in this\n\nmatter, and remand to the trial court for further action upon post-trial motions. Upon\n\nremand, the trial court may direct the parties to file supplemental post-verdict motions or\n\nbriefs articulating their positions regarding the proper disposition of the matter in light of\n\nour decision to overrule Azzarello and the further guidance articulated in this Opinion.\n\n       Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\n       Former Justice McCaffery did not participate in the decision of this case.\n\n       Mr. Justice Baer, Madame Justice Todd and Mr. Justice Stevens join the opinion.\n\n       Mr. Justice Saylor files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice\nEakin joins.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-80-2013] - 137\n\f</pre>",
