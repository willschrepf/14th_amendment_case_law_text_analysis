JONES, Circuit Judge:\n      The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a motion for further relief in this\n40-year-old case in order to gain oversight and some level of control over\nLouisiana’s school voucher program.         The program provides dynamic\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 2   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\neducational opportunities in the form of scholarships for thousands of\nstudents—85% of whom were African American in 2013—to attend better\npublic and private schools. The district court granted the DOJ’s motion for\nfurther relief and thus mandated annual reporting requirements for\nLouisiana’s school voucher program. Concerned by this interference with the\nvoucher program, parents of African-American students and the Louisiana\nBlack Alliance for Educational Options (“Appellants”) moved to vacate the\ndistrict court’s order under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), 60(b)(4), and\n60(b)(5).   The district court denied the motion.      We hold that the order\nconcerning the voucher program is beyond the scope of the district court’s\ncontinuing jurisdiction in this case and is therefore void for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. The district court should have granted the Rule 60(b)(4)\nmotion. The order is reversed and the injunction is therefore dissolved.\n                                        I\n      Given that the Department of Justice challenged Louisiana’s voucher\nprogram through a forty-year-old lawsuit, it is not surprising that this case has\na lengthy and complicated history.\n                                        A\n      Before 1969, Louisiana operated “dual racially segregated systems of\npupil assignment.” Brumfield v. Dodd, 405 F. Supp. 338, 342 (E.D. La. 1975).\nAny African-American students attending formerly all-white schools “did so\nunder the exercise of ‘freedom of choice’ options,” rather than any non-\ndiscriminatory assignment practice. Id. Between 1969 and 1970, almost all\nschool boards were ordered by various federal district courts to begin assigning\nstudents on a race-neutral basis. Id. A significant increase in private school\nattendance coincided with these court orders. Id. The Louisiana State Board\nof Education (now the Louisiana Department of Education) was empowered by\n\n\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028     Page: 3   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-31010\nthe state legislature to assist these private schools by providing textbooks,\nclassroom materials, and transportation. Id.\n         In 1971, a group of African-American families commenced this Brumfield\nlawsuit in federal court, and the United States intervened in the lawsuit\nshortly after the filing. Id. at 340. In 1975, a three-judge district court panel\nheld that Louisiana’s practice of subsidizing racially discriminatory private\nschools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId. at 348. In an order attached to the findings of fact and conclusions of law,\nthe three-judge panel ordered the state to take four actions:\n         • Cease “distributing or otherwise making available textbooks,\n           library books, transportation, school supplies, equipment, and\n           any other type of assistance, or funds for such assistance, to any\n           racially discriminatory private school or to any racially\n           segregated private school;”\n\n         • Implement a process for private schools to be certified as non-\n           discriminatory and thus be eligible for assistance from the\n           state;\n\n         • Create an accounting of all assistance provided to racially\n           discriminatory private schools since 1968; and\n\n         • Repossess all textbooks and classroom materials that had been\n           given to discriminatory private schools.\n\nThe court retained continuing jurisdiction with regard to the issues in the\norder.\n         The state operated under the 1975 injunction for a decade before the\nUnited States and Louisiana agreed in 1985 to refine through a consent decree\nthe certification process for assistance-eligible private schools. The consent\ndecree required the state to provide the DOJ with copies of all initial\ncertification applications and all annual compliance reports until 1988, copies\nof all complaints of racial discrimination by private schools applying for\n\n                                          3\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\ncertification for as long as the consent decree exists, and a list by category of\nall the funds provided to each private school for as long as the consent decree\nexists.   This certification regime has come to be known as Brumfield\ncertification.\n                                         B\n      In 2012, the Louisiana legislature passed the Student Scholarships for\nEducational Excellence Act. La. Rev. Stat. Ann §§ 17:4011–4025. The voucher\nprogram provides scholarships to attend public and Brumfield-certified private\nschools for students whose family income is below 250 percent of the federal\npoverty line and who are entering kindergarten or previously attended a school\nreceiving a grade of “C” or lower, with preference for students in “D” and “F”\nschools. Id. at § 17:4013. Applicants to the program list their top five schools\nin order of preference. The eligible applications are submitted to a third-party\nvendor, OneApp, that runs a lottery algorithm on the applicant pool. If the\nhighest ranked school on an applicant’s list has available seats, the applicant\nwill be awarded a scholarship to that school. If there are fewer seats than\napplicants to a particular school, the lottery algorithm optimally matches the\nstudents with schools, taking into account their preferences.          Results are\nadjusted based on a few statutory preferences, such as having a sibling in a\nparticular school. Id. at § 17:4015(3)(b). Applicants are then informed of their\naward and given an opportunity to accept or reject it. This lottery process is\nperformed three times a year. The amount of the scholarship is capped at the\naverage per-pupil spending for the public school district in which the applicant\ncurrently resides. Id. at § 17:4016(A). If the applicant is offered a slot to attend\na private school, and that private school’s tuition is less than the per-pupil\nspending of the applicant’s current school, then the amount of the scholarship\nwill be reduced to the amount of the private school tuition. Id.\n\n\n                                         4\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028    Page: 5   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-31010\n      In 2012–2013, Louisiana received more than 10,000 applications and\nawarded 4,900 scholarships. More than 90% of the recipients were minorities.\nThe following year, the state awarded roughly 6,800 scholarships, 85% of which\nwent to African-Americans.\n                                      C\n      The DOJ’s scrutiny of the voucher program began with a July 20, 2012\nletter requesting information from the Louisiana Department of Education. In\nthe letter, the DOJ stated that it wanted to review the possible impact of the\nvoucher program on “Brumfield-approved schools participating in the\nprogram, as well as the possible impact on the public schools and/or public\nschool systems” operating under court orders in other cases. To that end, the\nDOJ requested not only information and documents related to the mechanics\nof the program but also the name, address, grades, race, and public school\nhistory of every student receiving vouchers and every student who had been\noffered but declined a voucher. Louisiana responded by answering some of the\nquestions, but maintained that the “additional [unanswered] questions appear\nto be unrelated to Brumfield v. Dodd approval.”\n      Rather than file a new lawsuit, the DOJ moved to compel discovery\nunder this case in order to get the information it sought about the voucher\nprogram. The magistrate judge granted the motion to compel discovery, but\nspecified that the information could only be used in the present case and only\nby the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ.\n      The DOJ subsequently moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n59(e) to alter the magistrate judge’s order to allow the requested information\nto be shared within the DOJ and to be used in the various separate school\n\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\f     Case: 14-31010      Document: 00513266028        Page: 6     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-31010\ndesegregation cases still pending in many Louisiana parishes. 1 The magistrate\njudge granted the motion to amend.\n      In August 2013, the DOJ filed a motion for further relief. The DOJ\nrequested an order pursuant to the 1985 consent decree enjoining Louisiana\nfrom awarding any school vouchers to students who currently attend public\nschool districts subject to ongoing desegregation orders. Up to this point,\nhowever, the orders in this case dealt only with the proper steps required for\nthe state to provide money and assistance to non-discriminatory private\nschools. The Brumfield case never involved any desegregation issues in public\nschools. The DOJ alleged no violation of the consent decree or any other\nconstitutional violation relating to the funding of private schools in this case.\nInstead, the DOJ argued that a further injunction was needed in this case\nbecause the state had failed to “seek the approval of the appropriate federal\ncourt prior to awarding the vouchers to students” attending public schools that\nremained subject to desegregation orders in other cases.\n      A telephone conference was held on September 18, 2013, to discuss the\nDOJ’s pending motion for further relief. Following the conference, the district\ncourt entered an order setting a hearing in November and requiring the parties\nto brief two issues:\n            (1) Does the desegregation order issued in Brumfield v.\n      Dodd, 405 F. Supp. 338 (E.D. La. 1975) apply to the State of\n      Louisiana’s Student Scholarships for Educational Excellence\n      Program (“Voucher Program”) so as to require the State to obtain\n      authorization from the Court prior to implementation? (2) If the\n      desegregation order applies to the Program, is there any need to\n      amend existing orders to ensure a process of review of the Voucher\n      Program or similar ones in the future?\n\n\n\n\n      1 Many, or most, of such cases originated in the 1960s and 1970s, but they have never\nbeen dismissed.\n                                            6\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\nThe court also required Louisiana’s briefing to include “an analysis of the\nvoucher awards for the 2013–2014 school year respecting impact on school\ndesegregation in each school district presently under a federal desegregation\norder.”\n      Louisiana hired an expert to produce reports on the voucher program’s\nimpact for the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 school years. The expert, Christine\nRossell, is a professor of political science at Boston University who has 26\nyears’ experience designing and analyzing school desegregation plans. For\nboth school years facing scrutiny, she found that the program “had no negative\neffect on school desegregation in the 34 school districts under a desegregation\ncourt order.” The DOJ has produced no evidence to the contrary.\n      Five days after the September 18 order, the DOJ filed a supplement to\nits original motion for further relief. Without withdrawing its original motion\nfor a permanent injunction to stop the program, the DOJ rephrased its goals\nas seeking an annual process that would allow the federal government to\nreview Louisiana’s voucher awards in perpetuity.\n      On November 22, 2013, the district court held a hearing on the two\nquestions it posed in the September 18 order: (1) do the orders in the Brumfield\ncase apply to the voucher program, thus requiring court approval of the\nprogram; and (2) is there a need to amend the orders? At the hearing, the DOJ\nconceded that it had no objections to the existing Brumfield certification\nprocess for private schools and that Louisiana had complied with that\ncertification process and the consent decree.      The DOJ disclaimed that\nLouisiana had been funding discriminatory private schools. Instead, the DOJ\nexplained, its ongoing goal is “to determine whether or not assignments to\nthose [private] schools are impeding desegregation in public schools that those\n[voucher] students might have been assigned to.” To meet that goal, the DOJ\nrequested a second certification process essentially to pre-approve voucher\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028     Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\nawards. Rather than replace it, the proposed process would run parallel to the\nexisting Brumfield certification process for private schools receiving aid.\n      The district court issued an oral ruling at the November hearing,\nultimately deciding that it had jurisdiction and that some modification to the\nexisting thirty-year-old order would be necessary. The district court explained\nits ruling on jurisdiction in two sentences. First, the court stated that the\nvoucher program fell under the existing orders because “this Court has an\nobligation, as well as all parties on both sides have an obligation, to take\nreasonable steps in the process whereby the voucher program is not being used\nto promote segregation; and, in that regards [sic], the Constitution mandates\nit, this case mandates it, so it does apply.” The court added: “If the voucher\nsystem is being used to assign children to segregated school systems in the\nprivate arena, that’s in violation of the consent decree and the injunctions\nhere.” The court so reasoned in spite of the fact that the DOJ had already\nconceded that there had been no Brumfield consent decree violation here, and\nthat the private schools themselves are not “segregated.”       The court then\nassumed that resolving the jurisdictional issue also resolved whether a\nmodification was proper. Once the court had ruled that a modification would\nbe forthcoming, it required both parties to submit proposals.\n      On April 8, 2014, the district court entered an order creating a process\nfor continuing federal oversight of the voucher program to operate alongside\nthe existing private school certification process. Beyond the word “order,” the\nApril Order contains no label or helpful phrases to indicate whether it is a\nmodification to the 1975 order, a modification to the 1985 consent decree, or an\nentirely new injunction. The document is written in a similar format and\nstructure to the previous orders: the district court lays out a series of annual\ndeadlines for each step of the voucher award process.           First, the order\nestablishes that the outlined process will apply to “the 2014-2015 school year,\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028    Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-31010\nand for all future years….” The process requires Louisiana to report racial\ndata for each public school in the state, as well as state test scores for each\npublic school. For every applicant to the voucher program, Louisiana must\nprovide the DOJ with the following information: name, ID number, address,\nzoned school district, previous public school, grade level, race, whether the\ncurrent school is participating in the scholarship program, the applicant’s\nschool preference list, whether the student was deemed eligible to participate\nin the program, reasons for ineligibility, reasons for preferences in award of\nscholarship, and the name of the school for which Louisiana plans to offer a\nscholarship. The applicant information must be provided to the DOJ for review\nten days before the third-party vendor, OneApp, plans on notifying the\napplicants of their awards to allow for what the DOJ envisioned as a give-and\ntake-process for voucher awards. Finally, the order makes clear that any\ninformation provided under the orders of this case may be used in any of the\nschool desegregation cases in Louisiana and may be shared with other\nemployees of the DOJ beyond those of the Civil Rights Division.\n                                      D\n      On September 30, 2013, after the DOJ filed a motion for further relief,\nthe parents of African-American students and the Louisiana Black Alliance for\nEducational Option—appellants here—filed a motion to intervene as of right,\nwhich the DOJ opposed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). The district court denied the\nmotion for intervention, asserting that the intervenors lacked an interest in\nthe litigation.   The intervenors appealed the denial to this court, which\nreversed the district court on April 10, 2014. Brumfield v. Dodd (Brumfield I),\n749 F.3d 339 (5th Cir. 2014). This court did not find credible the DOJ’s claim\nthat the supplement to its motion for further relief abandoned its pursuit of a\npermanent injunction, because the supplement still argued that the state could\nnot operate the voucher program until the court approves it.       Id. at 342.\n                                      9\n\f   Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028    Page: 10   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\nAdditionally, this court recognized that even though the DOJ claimed no\ninterest in halting the program, a modification of the 1985 decree requiring\nLouisiana to get court approval meant that “the [federal] government will have\nthe ability to attempt to adjust some element of the scholarship program—\neither by changing which students receive the aid or by changing the schools\nin which they are placed—if not to urge that the program be killed entirely.”\nId. at 343. This court held that the parents’ interests met the requirements\nfor intervention. Id.\n      Because of the district court’s erroneous denial of their motion for\nintervention, the intervenors were unable to participate in important court\nproceedings. Consequently, they lost the right to participate in the November\nhearing that determined whether the court had jurisdiction and whether the\nprior case orders needed to be modified. The intervenors were also unable to\nparticipate in the oversight plan suggestion process.\n      The intervenors finally joined as parties a few days after the district\ncourt entered the April 8, 2014 order creating a new oversight process for the\nvoucher program. The intervenors could not directly appeal the order created\nwhile they were excluded as parties, but they moved to vacate the order by\narguing that the judgment was either void under Rule 60(b)(4) for lack of\njurisdiction or should be vacated under Rule 60(b)(5) due to changed\ncircumstances. Additionally, the intervenors moved to alter or amend the\njudgment under Rule 59(e). The motions were denied. The district court stated\nthat it had adequately addressed its jurisdiction in the November oral ruling\nand did not elaborate further. As for the 60(b)(5) motion, the district court held\nthat the cited law was not helpful to intervenors, because the cases were\ndistinguishable from and preceded the April 8 order. The 59(e) motion was\nrejected as duplicative of the arguments presented under Rule 60(b).\n\n\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 14-31010        Document: 00513266028          Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n       The Intervenors have appealed the denial of their motion to vacate the\nApril 8 order that established an ongoing oversight process for the voucher\nprogram.\n                                              II\n       This court’s review of intervenor’s Rule 60(b)(4) motion is de novo.\nJackson v. FIE Corp., 302 F.3d 515, 521–22 (5th Cir. 2002). The rule states\nthat a “court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final\njudgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) if the judgment\nis void.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) “Rule 60(b)(4) motions leave no margin for\nconsideration of the district court’s discretion as the judgments themselves are\nby definition either legal nullities or not.” Carter v. Fenner, 136 F.3d 1000,\n1005 (5th Cir. 1998).\n       Unlike the 60(b)(4) motion, Rule 60(b)(5) and Rule 59(e) motions “are\ndirected to the sound discretion of the district court, and its denial of relief\nupon such motion will be set aside on appeal only for abuse of that discretion.”\nSeven Elves v. Eskenazi, 635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir. 1981). 2\n                                              III\n       The DOJ initially contends that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction\nbecause the oversight regime created by the district court is only a “discovery\norder” that did not continue, modify, or refuse to dissolve an injunction. 3\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). We disagree. The oversight regime is clearly not a mere\n\n\n\n       2 Because we decide this case by applying Rule 60(b)(4), we express no view on the\napplicability of Rule 59(e) or 60(b)(5). Obviously, however, had the district court awaited this\ncourt's decision on intervention in Brumfield I, this would be a direct appeal rather than one\nrequesting post-judgment relief.\n\n       3 Alternatively, the DOJ argues that even if the oversight regime prescribes an\ninjunction, the denial of a motion to vacate the injunction is still not appealable under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) because the injunction pertained only to the pending proceedings and\nwas a step in the normal pretrial process.\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 12    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\ndiscovery order, and the DOJ’s position is completely at odds with the facts of\nthe proceedings in the district court. Because the April 8, 2014 order is an\ninjunction, the district court’s denial of the 60(b)(4) motion amounts to a\nrefusal to dissolve an injunction, making the denial appealable under this\ncourt’s precedent.\n      Even if an order is not a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291, the court of appeals has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1),\nwhich “gives this Court jurisdiction over interlocutory orders ‘granting,\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing, or dissolving injunctions.’” Shanks v. City of\nDallas, Tex., 752 F.2d 1092, 1095 (5th Cir. 1985).\n      Because the district court did not carefully label or describe the April 8\norder, there is some confusion as to whether it is a modification of the 1975\ninjunction or the 1985 consent decree, or an entirely new injunction. The\ndocument is labeled as an “ORDER,” and the paragraph that precedes the\nmonitoring    regime    states   only   that   the   court   has   reviewed    the\nrecommendations submitted by both parties. The DOJ seizes on the district\ncourt’s thumbnail introduction to argue that the April Order governs no more\nthan discovery because it relates to the sharing of information.\n      The content of the April Order makes clear that it is not for discovery.\nThe 1975 and 1985 certification processes also mandate a sharing of\ninformation, but all parties accept that the Brumfield certification regime is\nan injunction. The April Order creates a new and different certification regime\nfor the voucher program that will be repeated annually and indefinitely.\nBecause this oversight process is exactly the relief sought by the DOJ’s motion\nfor further relief, it is unlikely to lead to further judicial proceedings as would\nbe expected of a discovery order.       This process is not, as the government\ncontends, like a pretrial information swap that is limited in scope and duration.\nThe new oversight regime requires the state to engage in a costly activity:\n                                        12\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\ncompiling a long list of information pertaining to thousands of applicants and\nthousands of students as they continue to benefit from the voucher program.\nThis is a burdensome, costly, and endless process.\n      The DOJ’s previous actions also make clear that it never viewed its\nmotion for further relief as no more than a discovery order. After this case lay\ndormant for decades, the DOJ revived it with a motion to compel discovery,\nwhich the magistrate judge granted. After the DOJ received interrogatory\nresponses through the discovery request, the DOJ filed a motion for further\nrelief, not a second discovery motion, asking the court to enjoin the program.\nBefore the November hearing on the motion for further relief, the district court\nordered the parties to prepare briefing on whether there was “any need to\namend existing orders.”     (emphasis added).     During the November 2013\nhearing, the DOJ stated that it wanted to review and approve potential\nvoucher awards in each application cycle before the state made final awards.\nReferring to that arrangement, the DOJ explained, “that’s the modification to\nthe process [the prior consent decree and injunction] that we’re looking for.” It\nis disingenuous for the DOJ now to argue that the motion for further relief was\na request for a discovery order and the oversight regime is only for discovery.\n      Additionally, the district court repeatedly referred to the forthcoming\nrelief as a modification to the existing orders. During the November hearing,\nthe district court asked the parties how “a modification of the decree” would\nwork. After determining he had jurisdiction over the DOJ’s motion for further\nrelief, the court ordered the parties to submit proposed “modifications to the\nconsent decree . . . .” Thus, the court and the parties treated the April Order\nnot as discovery, but a further injunction.\n      Since the April Order was an injunction, the denial of the motion to\nvacate the April Order amounts to a refusal to dissolve an injunction under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). This court addressed a similar scenario in Kerwit Med.\n                                       13\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028      Page: 14    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\nProds., Inc. v. N. & H. Instruments, Inc., 616 F.2d 833, 835–36 (5th Cir. 1980).\nIn Kerwit, a 1971 consent judgment resulted in an injunction against the\nappellants. Id. at 835. In 1978, the appellants moved unsuccessfully under\nRule 60(b)(4) to vacate the judgment. Id. Appellees argued that denial of the\nRule 60(b) motion was premature because the court had not completely\ndisposed of the litigation. Id. This court, however, recognized that a denial of\na Rule 60(b) motion under such circumstances effectively “continue[s] or\nrefuse[s] to dissolve an injunction.” Id. at 836. Therefore, the denial itself was\nappealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Id. As in Kerwit, the denial of the\nintervenors’ motion to vacate here “refused to dissolve an injunction,” and the\ncourt’s order is appealable.\n                                        IV\n      Turning to the merits of the appeal, Rule 60(b)(4) states that a “court\nmay relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or\nproceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) if the judgment is void.” Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(b)(4). An order “is void only if the court that rendered it lacked\njurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or it acted in a manner\ninconsistent with due process of law.” Williams v. New Orleans Pub. Serv.,\nInc., 728 F.2d 730, 735 (5th Cir. 1984). Other errors in an underlying order\nwill not afford grounds for relief under the narrow ambit of Rule 60(b)(4) as\nthey would if the order itself had been directly appealed. Carter v. Fenner,\n136 F.3d 1000, 1005 (5th Cir. 1998).\n      We conclude that the April Order is void for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction because the voucher program is outside the scope of the district\ncourt’s continuing jurisdiction in this case.       Jurisdiction in an ongoing\ninstitutional reform case “only goes so far as the correction of the constitutional\ninfirmity.” United States v. Texas, 158 F.3d 299, 311 (5th Cir. 1998). The\noriginal 1975 decision held that the state violated the Equal Protection Clause\n                                        14\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 15     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\nby providing public aid to discriminatory and segregated private schools.\nBrumfield v. Dodd, 405 F. Supp. 338, 348 (E.D. La. 1975). In the 1975 order,\nthe district court retained continuing jurisdiction for the remedial purpose laid\nout in the order, which was to prevent future state aid to discriminatory\nprivate schools. For three reasons, the April 8 Order goes beyond correcting—\nand indeed has nothing to do with—the violation originally litigated in this\ncase. First, the voucher program’s potential impact on desegregation orders\nfor public schools in separate federal desegregation cases is distinct from\neliminating public funding for discriminatory private schools. Second, the\nvoucher program aid is for students rather than private schools. Finally, even\nif the voucher program aids private schools, it is not being given to\ndiscriminatory private schools.            The district court’s order exceeded the\nconstitutional infirmity on which this case was predicated and is therefore\nvoid.\n                                              A\n        The district court did not provide a detailed explanation for its ruling on\nthe issue of its jurisdiction. At the November 2013 hearing, the district court\norally held that “the voucher program would still be under the ambit” of the\noriginal orders in this case.         The court only provided a few sentences of\nexplanation. In part, the court explained that “this Court has an obligation, as\nwell as all parties on both sides have an obligation, to take reasonable steps in\nthe process whereby the voucher program is not being used to promote\nsegregation; and, in that regards [sic], the Constitution mandates it, this case\nmandates it, so it does apply.” 4          When the court denied the Intervenors’\n\n\n        4The district court gave some indication as to how it viewed the scope of the present\ncase by asking the DOJ whether it was better to monitor the impact of the desegregation\norders in the parish cases “in this overall case; or is it more effective to do it in the\nindividualized case?” This reveals a misunderstanding of the issue in this case. The present\ncase is not the “overall” statewide version of the parish desegregation cases. The parish cases\n                                             15\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 16     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\nRule 60(b)(4) motion, it did not respond to their lack of jurisdiction argument\nexcept to state that jurisdiction was “addressed at the November 22\nhearing . . . .”\n                                             B\n       The correct analysis of the scope of the court’s continuing jurisdiction\nbegins by identifying the constitutional infirmity addressed by this case in\n1975. United States v. Texas, 158 F.3d at 311. The original 1975 decision ruled\nthat “[b]ecause [the Louisiana statutes governing school funds] are\nimplemented by defendants so as to allow substantial state assistance to\nracially segregated private schools, the statutes run afoul of the equal\nprotection clause.” Brumfield, 405 F. Supp. at 348. Based on this holding, the\ncourt enjoined further state aid to discriminatory private schools and created\nthe Brumfield certification process to ensure that only non-discriminatory\nprivate schools were eligible for state aid. The 1975 order and 1985 consent\ndecree require information about the private schools; those orders do not\nconcern public school districts, the desegregation of which the DOJ and federal\ncourts continue to monitor in separate cases. See, e.g., Moore v. Tangipahoa\nParish Sch. Bd., 507 F. App’x 389, 390 (5th Cir. 2013). The Brumfield orders\nalso do not prevent aid to non-discriminatory private schools. Consequently,\nany order issued under the district court’s continuing jurisdiction over this case\nhad to be related to correcting the constitutional violation of providing state\naid to racially discriminatory private schools.\n\n\n\n\nresulted in public schools desegregation orders; this case is not a desegregation case at all,\nbut solely dealt with ending unconstitutional funding of private schools.\n       The court later added: “If the voucher system is being used to assign children to\nsegregated school systems in the private arena, that’s in violation of the consent decree and\nthe injunctions here.” This is factually incorrect. The DOJ has neither alleged that the\nprogram assigned children to segregated schools nor that the consent decree had been\nviolated.\n                                             16\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 17   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n      The DOJ’s concern that the voucher program may affect desegregation\nin public schools covered by other court orders is simply unrelated to the\nconstitutional infirmity that was litigated and decided in this case. The DOJ\nhas not alleged that the state has violated the 1975 order or the consent decree,\nthat the state has found a way to comply with the 1975 order or the consent\ndecree while still giving aid to discriminatory private schools, or that providing\nvouchers to students promotes discriminatory policies in private schools. The\nonly evidence before the trial court shows that there have been no negative\neffects on the desegregation of Louisiana’s public schools. Instead, the DOJ\ncontends that the state’s voucher program might potentially frustrate the\ndesegregation of public school districts in other pending cases.        The DOJ\nadmits that this position amounts to a fishing expedition. Its concession,\nmoreover, that Louisiana public school desegregation has not been adversely\naffected by the voucher program essentially acknowledges the legal and factual\ndisconnection of the Brumfield case from the parish cases.\n      The state’s voucher program is also outside the scope of this case because\nit provides aid to students rather than to private schools. First, the voucher\nprogram allows students to state their preference for public or private schools\non their applications.   It is then the students’ choice to accept the state\nscholarship so no money is given to a school, public or private, without the\napproval of the students’ families.     Second, the scholarship pays for the\nindividual student’s education; it does not aid private school operations. That\nis made clear by the fact that the scholarship is capped at the amount the state\nwould have spent on the child had the child attended a local public school. La.\nRev. Stat. § 17:4016. The scholarship covers the marginal cost of educating an\nadditional child.\n      Although it involved the Establishment Clause, Zobrest v. Catalina\nFoothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 113 S. Ct. 2462 (1993), considered an almost\n                                       17\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 18   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\nidentical issue: whether a statute that provided sign language interpreters for\ndeaf students in religious schools amounted to unconstitutional aid for\nreligious private schools. Id. at 12–13. The Court recognized that the effect of\nthe statute was not to subsidize private school functions but to assist disabled\nchildren. Id. at 12. Similarly, the Louisiana program is not designed to aid\nexisting private schools. The money follows the child, whether to public or\nprivate school. If the child chooses to remain at his or her current public school,\nno money is given to the alternative voucher program school. This program is\nhardly analogous to the public in-kind aid rendered to private schools in the\n1970s, which subsidized the schools. Brumfield, 405 F. Supp. at 347. The\ncurrent Louisiana voucher program is best characterized as aid to poor\nchildren rather than aid to private schools.        Therefore, it is outside the\njurisdiction of this case.\n      Finally, even if the vouchers constituted aid to private schools, the\ndistrict court did not have jurisdiction over the program, because the aid did\nnot go to discriminatory private schools.     Aid to racially non-discriminatory\nprivate schools is not subject to the court orders in this case. Because the DOJ\nhas conceded that the Brumfield certification process is working properly and\nthat all the private schools participating in the voucher program are Brumfield\ncertified, the April Order concerning the voucher program is not correcting the\nconstitutional infirmity—aid to racially discriminatory private schools—\nbecause the infirmity is not even alleged to exist. On this basis as well, the\nApril Order exceeds the continuing jurisdiction of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 19     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n                                             C.\n       Our colleague takes issue with this decision for two reasons. 5                   His\nthoughtful dissent merits a reply.\n       Initially, the issue of Intervenors’ standing to appeal is, for good reason,\nno longer challenged by the government or briefed by the parties. Although\njurisdictional, the Intervenors’ presence on appeal is settled by the law of the\ncase and the scope of the district court’s order. In Brumfield I, this court\nrejected the government’s characterization of its “data request” as anything\nother than a step on the road to enjoining the voucher program unless and\nuntil the state receives “authorization from the court prior to implementation.”\n749 F.3d at 342. Whether the government succeeds in its ultimate goal is not\nthe point.      Citing numerous prior cases, the court explained that the\nIntervenors’ interests are indeed affected by ongoing district court proceedings,\nand, “[t]he parents challenge the very premise that the Scholarship Program\nis subject to any such proceedings.” Id. at 343. 6 The court also thoroughly\n\n\n\n       5  The dissent also engages in editorial commentary about, on one hand, the\neducational success of Louisiana’s school voucher program and on the other hand, the need\nfor continuing vigilance over public school desegregation. As these expressions of opinion are\nirrelevant and the materials cited are far afield of the dissent, we do not respond.\n\n       6To reiterate, DOJ has never withdrawn its motion to modify the 1985 consent decree.\nThis court responded:\n       To be sure, the United States is claiming that, at the moment, it has no\n       intention of halting the voucher program or depriving anyone of an existing\n       scholarship. Yet, if a modification of the decree requiring court approval means\n       anything, it signifies that the government will have the ability to attempt to\n       adjust some element of the Scholarship Program—either by changing which\n       students receive the aid or changing the schools in which they are placed—if\n       not to urge that the program be killed entirely. The possibility is therefore real\n       that if the parents are not able adequately to protect their interests, some\n       students who otherwise would get vouchers might not get them or might not\n       get to select a particular school they otherwise would choose. The parents need\n       not wait to see whether that ultimately happens; they have already described\n       an interest justifying intervention.\nBrumfield I, 749 F.3d at 343-44.\n                                             19\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 20   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\nexplained why the Intervenors need only prove that their interests “may” be\nimpaired or impeded by the pending proceedings, not that they will be harmed.\nId. at 344.    “It would indeed be a questionable rule that would require\nprospective intervenors to wait on the sidelines until after a court has already\ndecided enough issues contrary to their interests. The very purpose of\nintervention is to allow interested parties to air their views so that a court may\nconsider them before making potentially adverse decisions.” Id. at 345. An\neven more perverse rule would deny these Intervenors’ right to appeal now,\nwhen they were erroneously prevented by the district court from airing their\nviews before it ruled against their interests as described in Brumfield I.\nFinally, the district court order directly affects the Intervenors insofar as it\n(1) requires the state to disclose to the federal government personal\ninformation about each student who applied for a voucher, (2) affords DOJ a\npre-voucher award review of this information, and (3) compels yearly updated\ndisclosures.\n      With more plausibility, the dissent contends that in allowing relief for\n“void” judgments, Rule 60(b)(4) is limited to cases where the lower court lacked\njurisdiction of the subject matter or the parties. Short of such circumstances,\nthe dissent asserts, Rule 60(b)(4) relief is unavailing to the Intervenors. We\ncordially disagree. This court’s case law is more nuanced. Williams, 728 F.2d\nat 735, held that a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) only if the court lacked\njurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, “or it acted in a manner\ninconsistent with due process of law.” In any event, the Supreme Court’s most\nrecent pronouncement concerning this rule did not mention these criteria.\nUnited Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 270, 130 S. Ct. 1367,\n1377 (2010). Instead, the Court stated:\n      Although the term ‘void’ describes a result, rather than the\n      conditions that render a judgment unenforceable, it suffices to say\n\n                                       20\n\f      Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028         Page: 21     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-31010\n        that a void judgment is one so affected by a fundamental infirmity\n        that the infirmity may be raised even after the judgment becomes\n        final . . . . The list of such infirmities is exceedingly short,\n        otherwise, Rule 60(b)(4)'s exception to finality would swallow the\n        rule.\nId.\n        The Court decided, however, that Espinosa presented no opportunity to\nreview lower courts’ assertions, construing Rule 60(b)(4), that a judgment is\nvoid because of a jurisdictional defect only in the exceptional case “in which the\ncourt that rendered judgment lacked even an ‘arguable basis’ for jurisdiction.”\nId. The Supreme Court, in sum, has not definitively interpreted this rule.\n        The dissent relies on various cases, not one of which is remotely similar\nto the instant case factually, temporally, or legally, 7 while it attempts to\ndistinguish the apposite precedent from this court and the Supreme Court. In\nUnited States v. Texas, supra, this court applied the Supreme Court’s decisions\nthat have systematically confined federal courts’ desegregation jurisdiction to\nremedial orders that do not exceed “the correction of the constitutional\ninfirmity.” 158 F.3d at 311. This court reiterated that, “[a]bsent any showing\nthat school authorities ‘have in some manner caused unconstitutional\nsegregation,’ the district court lacks any power to enjoin a change in school\nboundaries.”     Id. at 309 (citing Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler,\n427 U.S. 424, 434, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 2704 (1976) (quoting Swann v. City of\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, 402 U.S. 1, 28, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 1282 (1971))).\nAccording to the dissent, these cases concern “remedies” rather than the courts’\nabsence of “subject matter jurisdiction.” Consequently, the courts could abuse\n\n\n\n        7Turner Const.

Courts\nno more have power to invoke remedies against public bodies without liability\njudgments than they do to adjudicate controversies not fitting within under\nfederal jurisdictional standards. 8\n       Second, the lack of remedial power is compounded in this case because\nno federal constitutional violation has been alleged, litigated or adjudicated\nconcerning Louisiana’s voucher program. As we have noted, the DOJ concedes\nit cannot even allege such a violation, and the only record evidence, including\nthat cited by the dissent, points in favor of the program’s constitutionality. At\nleast in United States v. Texas and other desegregation decisions of the\nSupreme Court and this court, prior litigation had proven that public entities\nran segregated public schools; desegregation orders were tailored to remedy\nthe vestiges of segregation; and the courts’ subsequent orders pertained (even\n\n\n       8   A string of cases in this circuit has followed the Supreme Court’s desegregation\nrulings and reversed unauthorized orders that were claimed to spring from an old state-wide\nTexas desegregation decree. See Samnorwood I.S.D. v. Texas Educ. Agency, 533 F.3d 258\n(5th Cir. 2008) (court lacked authority to enforce desegregation decree against districts that\nhad never been sued); United States v. Texas (Hearne), 457 F.3d 472, 484 (5th Cir. 2006)\n(court lacked authority under decree to prohibit student transfers without showing of\ndistrict's unconstitutional behavior); United States v. State of Texas (Goodrich), 158 F.3d 299,\n309 (5th Cir. 1998) (court could not prevent detachment and annexation by school district\nwithout showing that authorities caused segregation); United States v. Texas, 680 F.2d 356,\n372 (5th Cir. 1982) (bilingual education mandate could not be imposed under statewide\ndecree without a finding of liability). The limit of federal courts’ remedial jurisdiction is plain\nunder these rulings. At what point does the imposition of novel “remedial orders” pursuant\nto increasingly antique desegregation consent decrees, without predicate liability findings,\nbecome not merely unauthorized, but abusive of federal courts’ power?\n                                               22\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 23     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\nif tenuously, given the passage of time) to the already-found violations. (Still,\nthe law confirms that additional “remedies” were beyond the courts’ power.)\n       Treating these cases narrowly, the dissent contends that “the existence\nof federal question jurisdiction in this section 1983 case that was filed more\nthan four decades ago should end our inquiry.” But what DOJ is doing here is\nnot “this section 1983 case” from forty years ago, nor is this dispute even\nrelated to the forty-year-old case. The original lawsuit here concerned the\nstate’s subsidy to racially discriminatory private schools; public schools were\nin no way involved nor did they participate. The court ordered the state to\ncease such funding and certify the private schools as non-discriminatory in\norder to obtain state aid. This remedy was tailored to the precise violations\nfound and, again, had nothing to do with desegregation of the public schools.\nThere is no dispute that the state has complied in good faith over the past\ndecades.\n       Now, however, the DOJ seeks to “reopen” this dormant case in order to\n(a) conduct an ongoing inquisition about the voucher program; (b) acquire\nreams of data from the state about both the public schools and thousands of\nprivate individuals who have signed up for the program; (c) ascertain the racial\nimpact of the program on public schools in many parishes that are subject to\nseparate court cases and desegregation decrees; and (d) maybe, someday assert\nthat the new voucher program unconstitutionally affects the public schools. 9\n(It bears mention that DOJ agrees that the Brumfield certification process isn’t\nrelated to and has nothing to do with the voucher program.)\n\n\n\n\n       9The dissent acknowledges the fundamental difference between the voucher dispute\nand the original case: “What the district court did was order that the State of Louisiana turn\nover demographic information about the enrollment to the Department of Justice, which\nwants to determine if the voucher program will have a negative effect on schools subject to\ndesegregation plans.”\n                                             23\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 24   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\n      A hypothetical explains why the court’s order in this case is void for lack\nof jurisdiction. Suppose a consent decree were formulated to enjoin a state\nfrom failing to provide adequate prisoner medical care required by the Eighth\nAmendment. The state complies with the decree in good faith. Decades later,\na party tries to “reopen” the case, asserting that the state is now violating the\nEighth Amendment by allowing rats to run wild in the prisons. No one would\ndoubt that the federal court must dismiss the motion because it lacks\njurisdiction to decide matters unrelated to the scope of the original decree. If\nthe court had no power to decide a new controversy through the medium of an\nold, unrelated decree, surely it has no power to order the state, under the guise\nof the original decree and without any new finding of illegal activity, to begin\nmassive reporting on rat populations and control throughout the prison\nsystem. The DOJ here is chasing rats.\n      The court’s order, imposing a vast and intrusive reporting regime on the\nState without any finding of unconstitutional conduct related to the Brumfield\nlitigation, much less the filing of a proper lawsuit, “was so affected by\nfundamental infirmity” that the infirmity was properly raised after judgment,\nEspinosa, 559 U.S. at 570, 130 S. Ct. at 1377, and the court acted without\njurisdiction and “in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.” Williams,\n728 F.2d at 735.\n                                   CONCLUSION\n      DOJ’s attempt to shoehorn its regulation of the voucher program into an\nentirely unrelated forty-year-old case represents more than ineffective\nlawyering. Despite the district court’s contrary conclusion, it seems plain that\nDOJ’s expressed concern—how the voucher program affects statewide public\nschools racially—has nothing to do with the narrow issues considered in the\nBrumfield litigation. DOJ’s bold strategy, if upheld, would circumvent the\nordinary litigation process in two ways. The reports it seeks do not fall under\n                                       24\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028       Page: 25    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-31010\nthe auspices of discovery permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nwhich authorize the compelled production of information only after a complaint\nalleges violations of law. Here, there was no complaint, hence no basis for DOJ\nto intrude into the affairs of Louisiana and its disadvantaged student\npopulation. American discovery follows the common law adversary process,\nnot the civil law’s inquisitorial process, yet DOJ seeks to be the inquisitor.\nEven more disturbing, DOJ’s motion, as explained in the November 2013\nhearing, essentially foretells its attempt—through pre-award “back and forth”\nwith the state on every single voucher—to regulate the program without any\nlegal judgment against the state. This court may not speculate why DOJ chose\nto avoid the path of litigation to prove a violation and thereafter enforce a\nremedy against the state and its school children. What is clear is that DOJ\nchose an unauthorized means to accomplish the same result.\n      The district court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the\nDOJ’s motion for further relief, which was outside the continuing jurisdiction\nof the 1975 order and the 1985 consent decree. Therefore, the April Order is\nvoid and the denial of the 60(b)(4) motion is reversed.\n      For the foregoing reasons, the April 2014 order of the district court is\nREVERSED,       the   injunctive    requirements     for     “further   relief”   are\nDISSOLVED, and the case is remanded with instructions to DISMISS the\nMotion for Further Relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028      Page: 26   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n\n\nGREGG COSTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n      Louisiana, with post-Katrina New Orleans leading the way, has become\nan important, and early studies show successful, 1 laboratory for education\nreform. One of those reforms provides scholarships to low-income students to\nenable them to attend better schools, the type of schools that most lawyers take\nfor granted that their children will attend.       Whether those students will\ncontinue to receive those “dynamic educational opportunities” (Maj. Op. at 1–\n2) is not at issue in this appeal. The ruling that the Intervenors challenge did\nnot prevent the students from receiving scholarships for the 2014–15 school\nyear or the current one. What the district court did was order that the State\nof Louisiana turn over demographic information about enrollment to the\nDepartment of Justice, which wants to determine if the voucher program will\nhave a negative effect on schools subject to desegregation plans. For two\nreasons, that is not a decision that we should review given the procedural\nposture in which this appeal arises.\n      First, I have significant doubts that the Intervenors have standing to\nbring this appeal.      This Court’s earlier decision recognizing that the\nIntervenors have an interest in the case warranting intervention does not\nautomatically establish that they have suffered a sufficient injury from the\nlimited order being appealed to confer standing at this stage. See Diamond v.\nCharles, 476 U.S. 54, 68 (1986) (“Diamond’s status as an intervenor below,\nwhether permissive or as or right, does not confer standing sufficient to keep\nthe case alive in the absence of the State on this Appeal.”); see also Rohm &\nHass Texas, Inc. v. Ortiz Bros. Insulation, Inc., 32 F.3d 205, 208 & n.12 (5th\n\n\n\n      1  Douglas N. Harris, Good News for New Orleans: Early Evidence Shows Reforms\nLifting Student Achievement, 15 EDUCATION NEXT 8 (Fall 2015).\n                                           26\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028       Page: 27    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                   No. 14-31010\n\n\nCir. 1994) (“Merely because a party appears in the district court proceedings\ndoes not mean that the party automatically has standing to appeal the\njudgment rendered by that court.”). Certainly the Intervenors would have\nstanding to appeal a decision invalidating the voucher program. That would\nimplicate the substantial injury of losing an educational opportunity for one’s\nchild, which was the basis for allowing the intervention. Brumfield v. Dodd,\n749 F.3d 339, 343–345 (5th Cir. 2014). But the district court has not taken\nthat step. At this point, it has deprived the students of nothing nor required\nthem or their parents to do anything. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S.\n488, 493 (2009) (“The regulations under challenge here neither require nor\nforbid any action on the part of respondents. . . . ‘[W]hen the plaintiff is not\nhimself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing\nis not precluded, but it is ordinarily ‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.’”)\n(quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562 (1992)). Only the\nState of Louisiana, which has not appealed, is under an obligation to produce\nthe data. A third-party typically does not have standing to challenge an order\nrequiring another party to produce information when no confidential data\nconcerning the third party is at issue. There is no contention that is the case\nhere. So the case for standing rests on a long chain of events that perhaps\nmight lead one day to a ruling that would result in the injury of losing the\nscholarships: 1) the data would have to provide some arguable basis for\nconcluding that the scholarship program is increasing segregation; 2) the\nDepartment of Justice (which by this point would likely be part of a different\nAdministration) would have to seek to enjoin the scholarship program based\non this data; 3) the district court would have to grant the motion. On its face,\nthis many conditions entails a high degree of speculation. But the fact that the\navailable data indicates that 85% of the scholarships in 2013 went to African-\nAmerican students (Maj. Op. at 2) means it is extremely unlikely—indeed\n                                     27\n\f    Case: 14-31010        Document: 00513266028          Page: 28     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n\n\nalmost unfathomable—that release of the full data would ever lead to enjoining\nthe voucher program on the ground that it is resegregating Louisiana schools.\nIf nothing else, that court action is not “certainly impending.” Clapper v.\nAmnesty Int’l USA, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 1150 (2013).\n       Admittedly, however, the line between imminent and speculative\ninjuries can be a fuzzy one. See Summers, 555 U.S. at 565 n.2 (“[I[mminence\nis concededly a somewhat elastic concept.”). More definite are the limitations\non our ability to provide relief from a “void” judgment pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), which is the mechanism through which the\nIntervenors sought to vacate the order requiring the State to share the\ninformation. There are only “two circumstances in which a judgment may be\nset aside under Rule 60(b)(4): 1) if the initial court lacked subject matter or\npersonal jurisdiction; and 2) if the district court acted in a manner inconsistent\nwith due process of law.” Callon Petroleum Co. v. Frontier Ins. Co., 351 F.3d\n204, 208 (5th Cir. 2003). The majority opinion tries to fit the district court’s\nruling as fitting into the first category of jurisdictional defects. 2 But because a\ncourt’s issuance of an injunction that exceeds its equitable powers does not\nundermine the court’s subject matter jurisdiction, Rule 60(b)(4) is the second\nbar to reaching the merits of this appeal.\n       “Jurisdiction” is a term that can mean different things, usually related\nto a court’s power or authority to do something. See United States v. Cotton,\n535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002) (noting that a prior Supreme Court decision had relied\non an “elastic conception of jurisdiction” different from the more limited notion\nof subject matter jurisdiction); see also BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed.\n\n\n\n       2 The opinion does include a couple references to a lack of due process. Maj. Op. at 24.\nThe district court only issued its challenged order after providing the State with “notice [and]\nan opportunity to be heard.” United States Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 271\n(2010) (describing the Rule 60(b)(4) due process standard).\n                                                  28\n\f    Case: 14-31010        Document: 00513266028          Page: 29     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n\n\n2014), 981–83 (listing four definitions for “jurisdiction” and over three pages of\ndefinitions for particular types of jurisdiction). But as the Supreme Court has\nrecently explained, only a “certain type of jurisdictional error” justifies the\n“rare” act of Rule 60(b)(4) postjudgment relief. United Student Aid Funds, Inc.\nv. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 268 (2010). As already mentioned, both in this\ncircuit and others, those types of jurisdictional error are limited to when a court\n“lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties.” 3 11 Charles Alan\nWright & Arthur Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2862 (3d ed.);\nsee also 12 James Wm. Moore, MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE § 60.44[1][a] (“A\njudgment is valid whenever the court that renders it has jurisdiction over the\nsubject matter and the parties.            In other words, a judgment is void, and\ntherefore subject to relief under Rule 60(b)(4), ‘only in the rare instance where\na judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a\nviolation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be\nheard.’”) (internal citation omitted). 4 We thus have recognized that even when\na court lacked authority, or one might colloquially say “jurisdiction,” to take a\ncertain action, Rule 60(b)(4) is not an avenue for relief.\n       Callon Petroleum was a case brought in federal court to recover on a\nbond. By the time the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, a state\n\n\n       3  And even when subject matter jurisdiction is at issue, “[o]nly when the jurisdictional\nerror is ‘egregious’ will courts treat the judgment as void.” Callon Petroleum, 351 F.3d at 208\n(quoting United States v. Tittjung, 235 F.3d 330, 335 (7th Cir.2000)).\n        4 Whether the “jurisdictional” errors subject to Rule 60(b)(4) correction are limited to\nthose involving defects in subject matter or personal jurisdiction appears to be the crux of the\npanel’s disagreement. On this point, the majority opinion is correct that Espinosa did not\nspecifically refer to subject matter or personal jurisdiction when mentioning the “type of\njurisdictional error” correctable under Rule 60(b)(4). Notably, however, it cited with approval\nthese sections of the two leading federal procedure treatises that characterize those two types\nof jurisdiction as the only ones that warrant Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Espinosa, 559 U.S. at 269.\nMore importantly, the lack of a more direct Supreme Court holding on this question is of no\nmoment when our own case law recognizes the limitation. See Callon Petroleum, 351 F.3d at\n208.\n                                                  29\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028       Page: 30   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n\n\ncourt delinquency proceeding for the defendant had commenced, which\nresulted in entry of an order that it was later argued prevented the federal\ncourt from entering judgment. The federal court’s diversity jurisdiction was\nenough to defeat the Rule 60(b)(4) motion even though we noted that Burford\nabstention was probably appropriate given the state insolvency proceeding.\nCallon Petroleum, 351 F.3d at 208–09.\n      Just as the existence of diversity jurisdiction in Callon Petroleum was\nenough to defeat the Rule 60(b)(4) motion, the existence of federal question\njurisdiction in this section 1983 case that was filed more than four decades ago\nshould end our inquiry. That is true even if the court here, as the majority\nopinion concludes, went beyond its equitable powers in ordering the state to\nproduce the data. Courts in areas of the law ranging from bankruptcy to the\nTucker Act have long recognized that a court’s exceeding the scope of its\nequitable powers does not mean it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\nGordon v. Washington, 295 U.S. 30, 36 (1935) (“Since the court had power to\nact, it is necessary to consider the various objections urged to the decree only\nin so far as they are addressed to the propriety of its action as a court of equity.\nThese objections were not foreclosed by the determination that the court had\njurisdiction”); Turner Const. Co. v. United States, 645 F.3d 1377, 1388 (Fed.\nCir. 2011) (finding an order that the Army reinstate a contract did not raise a\njurisdictional question because, while the appellant “frames this challenge as\na jurisdictional argument, it is actually a challenge of the scope of the Court of\nFederal Claims’ equitable powers” and these “concepts are distinct”).           We\nrecognized as much in In re Zale Corp., 62 F.3d 746 (5th Cir. 1995), when we\noffered the following explanation for why we first had to decide a difficult\nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction “[b]efore we address[ed] whether the\nbankruptcy court properly exercised § 105 power to issue the injunction”:\n\n\n                                           30\n\f    Case: 14-31010        Document: 00513266028          Page: 31      Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                        No. 14-31010\n\n\n       Subject matter jurisdiction and power are separate prerequisites to the\n       court's capacity to act. Subject matter jurisdiction is the court's authority\n       to entertain an action between the parties before it. Power under section\n       105 is the scope and forms of relief the court may order in an action in\n       which it has jurisdiction.\n\nId. at 751 (quoting In re Am. Hardwoods, Inc., 885 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir.\n1989)).\n       United States v. Texas, 158 F.3d 299, 311 (5th Cir. 1998), and the similar\ncases on which the majority opinion relies to establish that the problems it\nidentifies with the court order are jurisdictional ones that implicate Rule\n60(b)(4), is consistent with the line Zale draws. It says that “federal remedial\njurisdiction goes only so far as the correction of the constitutional infirmity.” 5\nId. at 311 (emphasis added). That statement relied on authority like Missouri\nv. Jenkins 6 and Milliken v. Bradley, 7 which are taught in law school courses on\nRemedies, but that say nothing about subject matter jurisdiction and thus are\nnot mentioned in Federal Courts.                Compare Douglas Laycock, MODERN\nAMERICAN REMEDIES (2d ed. 1994) at 284–93, 300–309 (discussing Jenkins,\nMilliken, and other cases addressing the scope of equitable power), with\nCharles Alan Wright and John B. Oakley, FEDERAL COURTS: CASES AND\nMATERIALS (10th ed. 1999) (not mentioning these cases). Indeed, the majority\nopinion cites no case ever granting Rule 60(b)(4) relief based on a court’s\nexceeding its equitable power. Nor any case finding more generally that an\n\n\n\n\n       5  Further proof that United States v. Texas did not involve a problem of subject matter\njurisdiction (a term not mentioned in the opinion) is that we reversed the order rather than\nvacated it. See U.S. v. Texas, 158 F.3d at 312. The latter is the proper resolution when\nsubject matter jurisdiction is lacking. See, e.g., Howery v. Allstate Ins. Co., 243 F.3d 912, 921\n(5th Cir. 2001) (vacating and remanding with instructions to dismiss due to lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction).\n        6 491 U.S. 274 (1989).\n        7 433 U.S. 267 (1977).\n\n                                                  31\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 32   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n\n\noverly broad injunction (or absence of authority to award some other remedy)\ngoes to a court’s subject matter jurisdiction.\n      This absence of authority is telling and should be dispositive. If any\ndoubt remains, however, other situations in which courts have rejected Rule\n60(b)(4) motions further demonstrate the inapplicability of the rule in this case.\nThe Tenth Circuit twice refused to grant Rule 60(b)(4) relief to vacate consent\ndecrees that may have been unlawful, concluding that those legal errors did\nnot undermine the court’s subject matter jurisdiction.

Safeway Stores, Inc., 611 F.2d 795, 799–800 (10th Cir.\n1979) (refusing to find consent decree void under Rule 60(b)(4) even though the\n“grant of enhanced seniority rights to all post-decree transferees rather than\nto all employees or to minority transferees only does not fulfill any legitimate\npurpose of Title VII”) V.T.A., Inc. v. Airco, Inc., 597 F.2d 220, 226 (10th Cir.\n1979) (“Even if the parties’ consent decree does technically run afoul of federal\npatent law principles, the problem would be one of relief from an erroneous\njudgment, not a void one. The district court had requisite jurisdiction over the\nparties and over the subject matter.”). Safeway Stores explained the reasoning\nthis way:\n      It is not the purpose of Rule 60(b) or the inherent powers of chancery to\n      allow the modification of a consent decree merely because it reaches a\n      result which could not have been forced on the parties through litigation.\n      . . . The fact that a consent decree exceeds the law by prohibiting lawful\n      conduct, or by granting an unauthorized remedy, does not render it void.\n      Such efforts may be grounds for reversal on appeal of the judgment, but\n      they are not grounds for collateral attack.\n\nSafeway Stores, 611 F.2d at 799–800 (internal citations omitted).\n      The Supreme Court’s recent Rule 60(b)(4) case, with bankruptcy again\nbeing the subject matter, provides the final illustration of just how narrow the\nRule is. The Court explained that Rule 60(b)(4) relief was not warranted\n\n                                          32\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 33     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n\n\nbecause the Bankruptcy Code “requirement that a bankruptcy court find\nundue hardship before discharging a student loan debt is a precondition to\nobtaining a discharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court's\njurisdiction.”    Espinosa, 559 U.S. at 272. The relief the bankruptcy court\nordered—discharge of the student loan without a hardship finding—was thus\nunlawful, but that did not render the judgment void. The same is true here,\neven if the majority opinion is correct that the relief ordered by the district\ncourt was unlawful.\n       Espinosa also explains why it is important to preserve the limited\nmeaning of a “void judgment”:\n       Although the term ‘void’ describes a result, rather than the conditions\n       that render a judgment unenforceable, it suffices to say that a void\n       judgment is one so affected by a fundamental infirmity that the infirmity\n       may be raised even after the judgment becomes final. The list of such\n       infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise, Rule 60(b)(4)’s exception to\n       finality would swallow the rule.\n\nId. at 270. 8 That interest in finality, along with the interest in restraint, is\nparticularly strong here. The students are receiving the scholarships, the\nDepartment of Justice was getting the data it wanted, and the State did not\nsee the need to appeal with its program intact.\n       The majority opinion’s “rats” hypothetical undoubtedly describes an\nextreme abuse of judicial authority. But courts act outside the scope of their\nauthority all the time, sometimes outrageously so but more often as a result of\nthe difficulty and variety of the issues we face. It would likewise be a flagrant\nviolation of the law for a court to award a $100 million punitive damages award\n\n\n\n       8 Expanding the reach of Rule 60(b)(4) makes even less sense in the context of an\ninjunction because Rule 60(b)(5) provides a mechanism for relief when an injunction in a\nlong-running institutional reform case like this one “is no longer equitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60.\n                                                 33\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 34    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\n\n\nagainst a municipality in a section 1983 case. See City of Newport v. Fact\nConcerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247 (1981) (holding that section 1983 does not permit\nan award of punitive damages against a municipality). Because of the blatant\nerror, such an award would be readily correctable in the normal appellate\nposture. A punitive damages award exceeding the court’s remedial power\nwould not, however, mean that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\nSee Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400, 408,\n413 (5th Cir. 2015) (affirming a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure\nto state a claim, rather than pursuant to 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, of a RICO claim seeking treble damages in light of City of\nNewport). The same would be true for the rat court’s abuse of its remedial\npower. That error, like all others including the unauthorized desegregation\norders the majority opinion cites, is correctable on direct appeal. But it is not\namong the errors that can be asserted under the “rare” 60(b)(4) procedure.\nEspinosa, 559 U.S. at 271.\n      The majority opinion may well be correct that the Department of Justice\nshould have litigated this issue in the numerous school desegregation cases\nstill pending in Louisiana federal courts rather than this one that focused on\nstate aid to segregation academies. And the statistics showing that 85% of the\nscholarship recipients are African-American indicate that not just its litigation\nstrategy, but also its concern about the potential effect of the voucher program\non desegregation may have proven misguided.                But vigilance about\nretrenchment in the area of school desegregation is not.

JONES, Circuit Judge:\n      The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a motion for further relief in this\n40-year-old case in order to gain oversight and some level of control over\nLouisiana’s school voucher program.         The program provides dynamic\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 2   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\neducational opportunities in the form of scholarships for thousands of\nstudents—85% of whom were African American in 2013—to attend better\npublic and private schools. The district court granted the DOJ’s motion for\nfurther relief and thus mandated annual reporting requirements for\nLouisiana’s school voucher program. Concerned by this interference with the\nvoucher program, parents of African-American students and the Louisiana\nBlack Alliance for Educational Options (“Appellants”) moved to vacate the\ndistrict court’s order under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), 60(b)(4), and\n60(b)(5).   The district court denied the motion.      We hold that the order\nconcerning the voucher program is beyond the scope of the district court’s\ncontinuing jurisdiction in this case and is therefore void for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. The district court should have granted the Rule 60(b)(4)\nmotion. The order is reversed and the injunction is therefore dissolved.\n                                        I\n      Given that the Department of Justice challenged Louisiana’s voucher\nprogram through a forty-year-old lawsuit, it is not surprising that this case has\na lengthy and complicated history.\n                                        A\n      Before 1969, Louisiana operated “dual racially segregated systems of\npupil assignment.” Brumfield v.

Id.\n         In 1971, a group of African-American families commenced this Brumfield\nlawsuit in federal court, and the United States intervened in the lawsuit\nshortly after the filing. Id. at 340. In 1975, a three-judge district court panel\nheld that Louisiana’s practice of subsidizing racially discriminatory private\nschools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId. at 348. In an order attached to the findings of fact and conclusions of law,\nthe three-judge panel ordered the state to take four actions:\n         • Cease “distributing or otherwise making available textbooks,\n           library books, transportation, school supplies, equipment, and\n           any other type of assistance, or funds for such assistance, to any\n           racially discriminatory private school or to any racially\n           segregated private school;”\n\n         • Implement a process for private schools to be certified as non-\n           discriminatory and thus be eligible for assistance from the\n           state;\n\n         • Create an accounting of all assistance provided to racially\n           discriminatory private schools since 1968; and\n\n         • Repossess all textbooks and classroom materials that had been\n           given to discriminatory private schools.\n\nThe court retained continuing jurisdiction with regard to the issues in the\norder.\n         The state operated under the 1975 injunction for a decade before the\nUnited States and Louisiana agreed in 1985 to refine through a consent decree\nthe certification process for assistance-eligible private schools. The consent\ndecree required the state to provide the DOJ with copies of all initial\ncertification applications and all annual compliance reports until 1988, copies\nof all complaints of racial discrimination by private schools applying for\n\n                                          3\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\ncertification for as long as the consent decree exists, and a list by category of\nall the funds provided to each private school for as long as the consent decree\nexists.   This certification regime has come to be known as Brumfield\ncertification.\n                                         B\n      In 2012, the Louisiana legislature passed the Student Scholarships for\nEducational Excellence Act. La. Rev. Stat. Ann §§ 17:4011–4025. The voucher\nprogram provides scholarships to attend public and Brumfield-certified private\nschools for students whose family income is below 250 percent of the federal\npoverty line and who are entering kindergarten or previously attended a school\nreceiving a grade of “C” or lower, with preference for students in “D” and “F”\nschools. Id. at § 17:4013. Applicants to the program list their top five schools\nin order of preference. The eligible applications are submitted to a third-party\nvendor, OneApp, that runs a lottery algorithm on the applicant pool. If the\nhighest ranked school on an applicant’s list has available seats, the applicant\nwill be awarded a scholarship to that school. If there are fewer seats than\napplicants to a particular school, the lottery algorithm optimally matches the\nstudents with schools, taking into account their preferences.          Results are\nadjusted based on a few statutory preferences, such as having a sibling in a\nparticular school. Id. at § 17:4015(3)(b). Applicants are then informed of their\naward and given an opportunity to accept or reject it. This lottery process is\nperformed three times a year. The amount of the scholarship is capped at the\naverage per-pupil spending for the public school district in which the applicant\ncurrently resides. Id. at § 17:4016(A). If the applicant is offered a slot to attend\na private school, and that private school’s tuition is less than the per-pupil\nspending of the applicant’s current school, then the amount of the scholarship\nwill be reduced to the amount of the private school tuition.

More than 90% of the recipients were minorities.\nThe following year, the state awarded roughly 6,800 scholarships, 85% of which\nwent to African-Americans.\n                                      C\n      The DOJ’s scrutiny of the voucher program began with a July 20, 2012\nletter requesting information from the Louisiana Department of Education. In\nthe letter, the DOJ stated that it wanted to review the possible impact of the\nvoucher program on “Brumfield-approved schools participating in the\nprogram, as well as the possible impact on the public schools and/or public\nschool systems” operating under court orders in other cases. To that end, the\nDOJ requested not only information and documents related to the mechanics\nof the program but also the name, address, grades, race, and public school\nhistory of every student receiving vouchers and every student who had been\noffered but declined a voucher. Louisiana responded by answering some of the\nquestions, but maintained that the “additional [unanswered] questions appear\nto be unrelated to Brumfield v. Dodd approval.”\n      Rather than file a new lawsuit, the DOJ moved to compel discovery\nunder this case in order to get the information it sought about the voucher\nprogram. The magistrate judge granted the motion to compel discovery, but\nspecified that the information could only be used in the present case and only\nby the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ.\n      The DOJ subsequently moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n59(e) to alter the magistrate judge’s order to allow the requested information\nto be shared within the DOJ and to be used in the various separate school\n\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\f     Case: 14-31010      Document: 00513266028        Page: 6     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-31010\ndesegregation cases still pending in many Louisiana parishes. 1 The magistrate\njudge granted the motion to amend.\n      In August 2013, the DOJ filed a motion for further relief. The DOJ\nrequested an order pursuant to the 1985 consent decree enjoining Louisiana\nfrom awarding any school vouchers to students who currently attend public\nschool districts subject to ongoing desegregation orders. Up to this point,\nhowever, the orders in this case dealt only with the proper steps required for\nthe state to provide money and assistance to non-discriminatory private\nschools. The Brumfield case never involved any desegregation issues in public\nschools. The DOJ alleged no violation of the consent decree or any other\nconstitutional violation relating to the funding of private schools in this case.\nInstead, the DOJ argued that a further injunction was needed in this case\nbecause the state had failed to “seek the approval of the appropriate federal\ncourt prior to awarding the vouchers to students” attending public schools that\nremained subject to desegregation orders in other cases.\n      A telephone conference was held on September 18, 2013, to discuss the\nDOJ’s pending motion for further relief. Following the conference, the district\ncourt entered an order setting a hearing in November and requiring the parties\nto brief two issues:\n            (1) Does the desegregation order issued in Brumfield v.\n      Dodd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1432702\"><a href=\"/opinion/1432702/brumfield-v-dodd/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The expert, Christine\nRossell, is a professor of political science at Boston University who has 26\nyears’ experience designing and analyzing school desegregation plans. For\nboth school years facing scrutiny, she found that the program “had no negative\neffect on school desegregation in the 34 school districts under a desegregation\ncourt order.” The DOJ has produced no evidence to the contrary.\n      Five days after the September 18 order, the DOJ filed a supplement to\nits original motion for further relief. Without withdrawing its original motion\nfor a permanent injunction to stop the program, the DOJ rephrased its goals\nas seeking an annual process that would allow the federal government to\nreview Louisiana’s voucher awards in perpetuity.\n      On November 22, 2013, the district court held a hearing on the two\nquestions it posed in the September 18 order: (1) do the orders in the Brumfield\ncase apply to the voucher program, thus requiring court approval of the\nprogram; and (2) is there a need to amend the orders? At the hearing, the DOJ\nconceded that it had no objections to the existing Brumfield certification\nprocess for private schools and that Louisiana had complied with that\ncertification process and the consent decree.      The DOJ disclaimed that\nLouisiana had been funding discriminatory private schools. Instead, the DOJ\nexplained, its ongoing goal is “to determine whether or not assignments to\nthose [private] schools are impeding desegregation in public schools that those\n[voucher] students might have been assigned to.” To meet that goal, the DOJ\nrequested a second certification process essentially to pre-approve voucher\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028     Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\nawards. Rather than replace it, the proposed process would run parallel to the\nexisting Brumfield certification process for private schools receiving aid.\n      The district court issued an oral ruling at the November hearing,\nultimately deciding that it had jurisdiction and that some modification to the\nexisting thirty-year-old order would be necessary. The district court explained\nits ruling on jurisdiction in two sentences. First, the court stated that the\nvoucher program fell under the existing orders because “this Court has an\nobligation, as well as all parties on both sides have an obligation, to take\nreasonable steps in the process whereby the voucher program is not being used\nto promote segregation; and, in that regards [sic], the Constitution mandates\nit, this case mandates it, so it does apply.” The court added: “If the voucher\nsystem is being used to assign children to segregated school systems in the\nprivate arena, that’s in violation of the consent decree and the injunctions\nhere.” The court so reasoned in spite of the fact that the DOJ had already\nconceded that there had been no Brumfield consent decree violation here, and\nthat the private schools themselves are not “segregated.”       The court then\nassumed that resolving the jurisdictional issue also resolved whether a\nmodification was proper. Once the court had ruled that a modification would\nbe forthcoming, it required both parties to submit proposals.\n      On April 8, 2014, the district court entered an order creating a process\nfor continuing federal oversight of the voucher program to operate alongside\nthe existing private school certification process. Beyond the word “order,” the\nApril Order contains no label or helpful phrases to indicate whether it is a\nmodification to the 1975 order, a modification to the 1985 consent decree, or an\nentirely new injunction. The document is written in a similar format and\nstructure to the previous orders: the district court lays out a series of annual\ndeadlines for each step of the voucher award process.           First, the order\nestablishes that the outlined process will apply to “the 2014-2015 school year,\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028    Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-31010\nand for all future years….” The process requires Louisiana to report racial\ndata for each public school in the state, as well as state test scores for each\npublic school. For every applicant to the voucher program, Louisiana must\nprovide the DOJ with the following information: name, ID number, address,\nzoned school district, previous public school, grade level, race, whether the\ncurrent school is participating in the scholarship program, the applicant’s\nschool preference list, whether the student was deemed eligible to participate\nin the program, reasons for ineligibility, reasons for preferences in award of\nscholarship, and the name of the school for which Louisiana plans to offer a\nscholarship. The applicant information must be provided to the DOJ for review\nten days before the third-party vendor, OneApp, plans on notifying the\napplicants of their awards to allow for what the DOJ envisioned as a give-and\ntake-process for voucher awards. Finally, the order makes clear that any\ninformation provided under the orders of this case may be used in any of the\nschool desegregation cases in Louisiana and may be shared with other\nemployees of the DOJ beyond those of the Civil Rights Division.\n                                      D\n      On September 30, 2013, after the DOJ filed a motion for further relief,\nthe parents of African-American students and the Louisiana Black Alliance for\nEducational Option—appellants here—filed a motion to intervene as of right,\nwhich the DOJ opposed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). The district court denied the\nmotion for intervention, asserting that the intervenors lacked an interest in\nthe litigation.   The intervenors appealed the denial to this court, which\nreversed the district court on April 10, 2014. Brumfield v.

This court did not find credible the DOJ’s claim\nthat the supplement to its motion for further relief abandoned its pursuit of a\npermanent injunction, because the supplement still argued that the state could\nnot operate the voucher program until the court approves it.

This court held that the parents’ interests met the requirements\nfor intervention. Id.\n      Because of the district court’s erroneous denial of their motion for\nintervention, the intervenors were unable to participate in important court\nproceedings. Consequently, they lost the right to participate in the November\nhearing that determined whether the court had jurisdiction and whether the\nprior case orders needed to be modified. The intervenors were also unable to\nparticipate in the oversight plan suggestion process.\n      The intervenors finally joined as parties a few days after the district\ncourt entered the April 8, 2014 order creating a new oversight process for the\nvoucher program. The intervenors could not directly appeal the order created\nwhile they were excluded as parties, but they moved to vacate the order by\narguing that the judgment was either void under Rule 60(b)(4) for lack of\njurisdiction or should be vacated under Rule 60(b)(5) due to changed\ncircumstances. Additionally, the intervenors moved to alter or amend the\njudgment under Rule 59(e). The motions were denied. The district court stated\nthat it had adequately addressed its jurisdiction in the November oral ruling\nand did not elaborate further. As for the 60(b)(5) motion, the district court held\nthat the cited law was not helpful to intervenors, because the cases were\ndistinguishable from and preceded the April 8 order. The 59(e) motion was\nrejected as duplicative of the arguments presented under Rule 60(b).\n\n\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 14-31010        Document: 00513266028          Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n       The Intervenors have appealed the denial of their motion to vacate the\nApril 8 order that established an ongoing oversight process for the voucher\nprogram.\n                                              II\n       This court’s review of intervenor’s Rule 60(b)(4) motion is de novo.\nJackson v.

Obviously, however, had the district court awaited this\ncourt's decision on intervention in Brumfield I, this would be a direct appeal rather than one\nrequesting post-judgment relief.\n\n       3 Alternatively, the DOJ argues that even if the oversight regime prescribes an\ninjunction, the denial of a motion to vacate the injunction is still not appealable under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) because the injunction pertained only to the pending proceedings and\nwas a step in the normal pretrial process.\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 12    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\ndiscovery order, and the DOJ’s position is completely at odds with the facts of\nthe proceedings in the district court. Because the April 8, 2014 order is an\ninjunction, the district court’s denial of the 60(b)(4) motion amounts to a\nrefusal to dissolve an injunction, making the denial appealable under this\ncourt’s precedent.\n      Even if an order is not a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291, the court of appeals has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1),\nwhich “gives this Court jurisdiction over interlocutory orders ‘granting,\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing, or dissolving injunctions.’” Shanks v. City of\nDallas, Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446799\"><a href=\"/opinion/446799/barbara-shanks-of-the-estate-of-marvin-daniels-individually-and-as-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1095 (5th Cir. 1985).\n      Because the district court did not carefully label or describe the April 8\norder, there is some confusion as to whether it is a modification of the 1975\ninjunction or the 1985 consent decree, or an entirely new injunction. The\ndocument is labeled as an “ORDER,” and the paragraph that precedes the\nmonitoring    regime    states   only   that   the   court   has   reviewed    the\nrecommendations submitted by both parties. The DOJ seizes on the district\ncourt’s thumbnail introduction to argue that the April Order governs no more\nthan discovery because it relates to the sharing of information.\n      The content of the April Order makes clear that it is not for discovery.\nThe 1975 and 1985 certification processes also mandate a sharing of\ninformation, but all parties accept that the Brumfield certification regime is\nan injunction. The April Order creates a new and different certification regime\nfor the voucher program that will be repeated annually and indefinitely.\nBecause this oversight process is exactly the relief sought by the DOJ’s motion\nfor further relief, it is unlikely to lead to further judicial proceedings as would\nbe expected of a discovery order.       This process is not, as the government\ncontends, like a pretrial information swap that is limited in scope and duration.\nThe new oversight regime requires the state to engage in a costly activity:\n                                        12\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\ncompiling a long list of information pertaining to thousands of applicants and\nthousands of students as they continue to benefit from the voucher program.\nThis is a burdensome, costly, and endless process.\n      The DOJ’s previous actions also make clear that it never viewed its\nmotion for further relief as no more than a discovery order. After this case lay\ndormant for decades, the DOJ revived it with a motion to compel discovery,\nwhich the magistrate judge granted. After the DOJ received interrogatory\nresponses through the discovery request, the DOJ filed a motion for further\nrelief, not a second discovery motion, asking the court to enjoin the program.\nBefore the November hearing on the motion for further relief, the district court\nordered the parties to prepare briefing on whether there was “any need to\namend existing orders.”     (emphasis added).     During the November 2013\nhearing, the DOJ stated that it wanted to review and approve potential\nvoucher awards in each application cycle before the state made final awards.\nReferring to that arrangement, the DOJ explained, “that’s the modification to\nthe process [the prior consent decree and injunction] that we’re looking for.” It\nis disingenuous for the DOJ now to argue that the motion for further relief was\na request for a discovery order and the oversight regime is only for discovery.\n      Additionally, the district court repeatedly referred to the forthcoming\nrelief as a modification to the existing orders. During the November hearing,\nthe district court asked the parties how “a modification of the decree” would\nwork. After determining he had jurisdiction over the DOJ’s motion for further\nrelief, the court ordered the parties to submit proposed “modifications to the\nconsent decree . . . .” Thus, the court and the parties treated the April Order\nnot as discovery, but a further injunction.\n      Since the April Order was an injunction, the denial of the motion to\nvacate the April Order amounts to a refusal to dissolve an injunction under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). This court addressed a similar scenario in Kerwit Med.\n                                       13\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028      Page: 14    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\nProds., Inc. v.

In the 1975 order,\nthe district court retained continuing jurisdiction for the remedial purpose laid\nout in the order, which was to prevent future state aid to discriminatory\nprivate schools. For three reasons, the April 8 Order goes beyond correcting—\nand indeed has nothing to do with—the violation originally litigated in this\ncase. First, the voucher program’s potential impact on desegregation orders\nfor public schools in separate federal desegregation cases is distinct from\neliminating public funding for discriminatory private schools. Second, the\nvoucher program aid is for students rather than private schools. Finally, even\nif the voucher program aids private schools, it is not being given to\ndiscriminatory private schools.            The district court’s order exceeded the\nconstitutional infirmity on which this case was predicated and is therefore\nvoid.\n                                              A\n        The district court did not provide a detailed explanation for its ruling on\nthe issue of its jurisdiction. At the November 2013 hearing, the district court\norally held that “the voucher program would still be under the ambit” of the\noriginal orders in this case.         The court only provided a few sentences of\nexplanation. In part, the court explained that “this Court has an obligation, as\nwell as all parties on both sides have an obligation, to take reasonable steps in\nthe process whereby the voucher program is not being used to promote\nsegregation; and, in that regards [sic], the Constitution mandates it, this case\nmandates it, so it does apply.” 4          When the court denied the Intervenors’\n\n\n        4The district court gave some indication as to how it viewed the scope of the present\ncase by asking the DOJ whether it was better to monitor the impact of the desegregation\norders in the parish cases “in this overall case; or is it more effective to do it in the\nindividualized case?” This reveals a misunderstanding of the issue in this case. The present\ncase is not the “overall” statewide version of the parish desegregation cases. The parish cases\n                                             15\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 16     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\nRule 60(b)(4) motion, it did not respond to their lack of jurisdiction argument\nexcept to state that jurisdiction was “addressed at the November 22\nhearing . . . .”\n                                             B\n       The correct analysis of the scope of the court’s continuing jurisdiction\nbegins by identifying the constitutional infirmity addressed by this case in\n1975. United States v. Texas, 158 F.3d at 311. The original 1975 decision ruled\nthat “[b]ecause [the Louisiana statutes governing school funds] are\nimplemented by defendants so as to allow substantial state assistance to\nracially segregated private schools, the statutes run afoul of the equal\nprotection clause.” Brumfield, 405 F. Supp. at 348. Based on this holding, the\ncourt enjoined further state aid to discriminatory private schools and created\nthe Brumfield certification process to ensure that only non-discriminatory\nprivate schools were eligible for state aid. The 1975 order and 1985 consent\ndecree require information about the private schools; those orders do not\nconcern public school districts, the desegregation of which the DOJ and federal\ncourts continue to monitor in separate cases. See, e.g., Moore v. Tangipahoa\nParish Sch. Bd., 507 F. App’x 389, 390 (5th Cir. 2013). The Brumfield orders\nalso do not prevent aid to non-discriminatory private schools. Consequently,\nany order issued under the district court’s continuing jurisdiction over this case\nhad to be related to correcting the constitutional violation of providing state\naid to racially discriminatory private schools.\n\n\n\n\nresulted in public schools desegregation orders; this case is not a desegregation case at all,\nbut solely dealt with ending unconstitutional funding of private schools.\n       The court later added: “If the voucher system is being used to assign children to\nsegregated school systems in the private arena, that’s in violation of the consent decree and\nthe injunctions here.” This is factually incorrect. The DOJ has neither alleged that the\nprogram assigned children to segregated schools nor that the consent decree had been\nviolated.\n                                             16\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 17   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n      The DOJ’s concern that the voucher program may affect desegregation\nin public schools covered by other court orders is simply unrelated to the\nconstitutional infirmity that was litigated and decided in this case. The DOJ\nhas not alleged that the state has violated the 1975 order or the consent decree,\nthat the state has found a way to comply with the 1975 order or the consent\ndecree while still giving aid to discriminatory private schools, or that providing\nvouchers to students promotes discriminatory policies in private schools. The\nonly evidence before the trial court shows that there have been no negative\neffects on the desegregation of Louisiana’s public schools. Instead, the DOJ\ncontends that the state’s voucher program might potentially frustrate the\ndesegregation of public school districts in other pending cases.        The DOJ\nadmits that this position amounts to a fishing expedition. Its concession,\nmoreover, that Louisiana public school desegregation has not been adversely\naffected by the voucher program essentially acknowledges the legal and factual\ndisconnection of the Brumfield case from the parish cases.\n      The state’s voucher program is also outside the scope of this case because\nit provides aid to students rather than to private schools. First, the voucher\nprogram allows students to state their preference for public or private schools\non their applications.   It is then the students’ choice to accept the state\nscholarship so no money is given to a school, public or private, without the\napproval of the students’ families.     Second, the scholarship pays for the\nindividual student’s education; it does not aid private school operations.

Id. at 12–13. The Court recognized that the effect of\nthe statute was not to subsidize private school functions but to assist disabled\nchildren. Id. at 12. Similarly, the Louisiana program is not designed to aid\nexisting private schools. The money follows the child, whether to public or\nprivate school. If the child chooses to remain at his or her current public school,\nno money is given to the alternative voucher program school. This program is\nhardly analogous to the public in-kind aid rendered to private schools in the\n1970s, which subsidized the schools. Brumfield, 405 F. Supp. at 347. The\ncurrent Louisiana voucher program is best characterized as aid to poor\nchildren rather than aid to private schools.        Therefore, it is outside the\njurisdiction of this case.\n      Finally, even if the vouchers constituted aid to private schools, the\ndistrict court did not have jurisdiction over the program, because the aid did\nnot go to discriminatory private schools.     Aid to racially non-discriminatory\nprivate schools is not subject to the court orders in this case. Because the DOJ\nhas conceded that the Brumfield certification process is working properly and\nthat all the private schools participating in the voucher program are Brumfield\ncertified, the April Order concerning the voucher program is not correcting the\nconstitutional infirmity—aid to racially discriminatory private schools—\nbecause the infirmity is not even alleged to exist. On this basis as well, the\nApril Order exceeds the continuing jurisdiction of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 19     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n                                             C.\n       Our colleague takes issue with this decision for two reasons. 5                   His\nthoughtful dissent merits a reply.\n       Initially, the issue of Intervenors’ standing to appeal is, for good reason,\nno longer challenged by the government or briefed by the parties. Although\njurisdictional, the Intervenors’ presence on appeal is settled by the law of the\ncase and the scope of the district court’s order. In Brumfield I, this court\nrejected the government’s characterization of its “data request” as anything\nother than a step on the road to enjoining the voucher program unless and\nuntil the state receives “authorization from the court prior to implementation.”\n749 F.3d at 342. Whether the government succeeds in its ultimate goal is not\nthe point.      Citing numerous prior cases, the court explained that the\nIntervenors’ interests are indeed affected by ongoing district court proceedings,\nand, “[t]he parents challenge the very premise that the Scholarship Program\nis subject to any such proceedings.” Id. at 343. 6 The court also thoroughly\n\n\n\n       5  The dissent also engages in editorial commentary about, on one hand, the\neducational success of Louisiana’s school voucher program and on the other hand, the need\nfor continuing vigilance over public school desegregation. As these expressions of opinion are\nirrelevant and the materials cited are far afield of the dissent, we do not respond.\n\n       6To reiterate, DOJ has never withdrawn its motion to modify the 1985 consent decree.\nThis court responded:\n       To be sure, the United States is claiming that, at the moment, it has no\n       intention of halting the voucher program or depriving anyone of an existing\n       scholarship. Yet, if a modification of the decree requiring court approval means\n       anything, it signifies that the government will have the ability to attempt to\n       adjust some element of the Scholarship Program—either by changing which\n       students receive the aid or changing the schools in which they are placed—if\n       not to urge that the program be killed entirely. The possibility is therefore real\n       that if the parents are not able adequately to protect their interests, some\n       students who otherwise would get vouchers might not get them or might not\n       get to select a particular school they otherwise would choose. The parents need\n       not wait to see whether that ultimately happens; they have already described\n       an interest justifying intervention.\nBrumfield I, 749 F.3d at 343-44.\n                                             19\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028      Page: 20   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\nexplained why the Intervenors need only prove that their interests “may” be\nimpaired or impeded by the pending proceedings, not that they will be harmed.\nId. at 344.    “It would indeed be a questionable rule that would require\nprospective intervenors to wait on the sidelines until after a court has already\ndecided enough issues contrary to their interests. The very purpose of\nintervention is to allow interested parties to air their views so that a court may\nconsider them before making potentially adverse decisions.” Id. at 345. An\neven more perverse rule would deny these Intervenors’ right to appeal now,\nwhen they were erroneously prevented by the district court from airing their\nviews before it ruled against their interests as described in Brumfield I.\nFinally, the district court order directly affects the Intervenors insofar as it\n(1) requires the state to disclose to the federal government personal\ninformation about each student who applied for a voucher, (2) affords DOJ a\npre-voucher award review of this information, and (3) compels yearly updated\ndisclosures.\n      With more plausibility, the dissent contends that in allowing relief for\n“void” judgments, Rule 60(b)(4) is limited to cases where the lower court lacked\njurisdiction of the subject matter or the parties. Short of such circumstances,\nthe dissent asserts, Rule 60(b)(4) relief is unavailing to the Intervenors. We\ncordially disagree. This court’s case law is more nuanced. Williams, 728 F.2d\nat 735, held that a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) only if the court lacked\njurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, “or it acted in a manner\ninconsistent with due process of law.” In any event, the Supreme Court’s most\nrecent pronouncement concerning this rule did not mention these criteria.\nUnited Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.

The list of such infirmities is exceedingly short,\n        otherwise, Rule 60(b)(4)'s exception to finality would swallow the\n        rule.\nId.\n        The Court decided, however, that Espinosa presented no opportunity to\nreview lower courts’ assertions, construing Rule 60(b)(4), that a judgment is\nvoid because of a jurisdictional defect only in the exceptional case “in which the\ncourt that rendered judgment lacked even an ‘arguable basis’ for jurisdiction.”\nId. The Supreme Court, in sum, has not definitively interpreted this rule.\n        The dissent relies on various cases, not one of which is remotely similar\nto the instant case factually, temporally, or legally, 7 while it attempts to\ndistinguish the apposite precedent from this court and the Supreme Court. In\nUnited States v. Texas, supra, this court applied the Supreme Court’s decisions\nthat have systematically confined federal courts’ desegregation jurisdiction to\nremedial orders that do not exceed “the correction of the constitutional\ninfirmity.” 158 F.3d at 311. This court reiterated that, “[a]bsent any showing\nthat school authorities ‘have in some manner caused unconstitutional\nsegregation,’ the district court lacks any power to enjoin a change in school\nboundaries.”     Id. at 309 (citing Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v.

Courts\nno more have power to invoke remedies against public bodies without liability\njudgments than they do to adjudicate controversies not fitting within under\nfederal jurisdictional standards. 8\n       Second, the lack of remedial power is compounded in this case because\nno federal constitutional violation has been alleged, litigated or adjudicated\nconcerning Louisiana’s voucher program. As we have noted, the DOJ concedes\nit cannot even allege such a violation, and the only record evidence, including\nthat cited by the dissent, points in favor of the program’s constitutionality. At\nleast in United States v. Texas and other desegregation decisions of the\nSupreme Court and this court, prior litigation had proven that public entities\nran segregated public schools; desegregation orders were tailored to remedy\nthe vestiges of segregation; and the courts’ subsequent orders pertained (even\n\n\n       8   A string of cases in this circuit has followed the Supreme Court’s desegregation\nrulings and reversed unauthorized orders that were claimed to spring from an old state-wide\nTexas desegregation decree.

The limit of federal courts’ remedial jurisdiction is plain\nunder these rulings.

(Still,\nthe law confirms that additional “remedies” were beyond the courts’ power.)\n       Treating these cases narrowly, the dissent contends that “the existence\nof federal question jurisdiction in this section 1983 case that was filed more\nthan four decades ago should end our inquiry.” But what DOJ is doing here is\nnot “this section 1983 case” from forty years ago, nor is this dispute even\nrelated to the forty-year-old case. The original lawsuit here concerned the\nstate’s subsidy to racially discriminatory private schools; public schools were\nin no way involved nor did they participate. The court ordered the state to\ncease such funding and certify the private schools as non-discriminatory in\norder to obtain state aid. This remedy was tailored to the precise violations\nfound and, again, had nothing to do with desegregation of the public schools.\nThere is no dispute that the state has complied in good faith over the past\ndecades.\n       Now, however, the DOJ seeks to “reopen” this dormant case in order to\n(a) conduct an ongoing inquisition about the voucher program; (b) acquire\nreams of data from the state about both the public schools and thousands of\nprivate individuals who have signed up for the program; (c) ascertain the racial\nimpact of the program on public schools in many parishes that are subject to\nseparate court cases and desegregation decrees; and (d) maybe, someday assert\nthat the new voucher program unconstitutionally affects the public schools. 9\n(It bears mention that DOJ agrees that the Brumfield certification process isn’t\nrelated to and has nothing to do with the voucher program.)\n\n\n\n\n       9The dissent acknowledges the fundamental difference between the voucher dispute\nand the original case: “What the district court did was order that the State of Louisiana turn\nover demographic information about the enrollment to the Department of Justice, which\nwants to determine if the voucher program will have a negative effect on schools subject to\ndesegregation plans.”\n                                             23\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028     Page: 24   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-31010\n      A hypothetical explains why the court’s order in this case is void for lack\nof jurisdiction. Suppose a consent decree were formulated to enjoin a state\nfrom failing to provide adequate prisoner medical care required by the Eighth\nAmendment. The state complies with the decree in good faith. Decades later,\na party tries to “reopen” the case, asserting that the state is now violating the\nEighth Amendment by allowing rats to run wild in the prisons. No one would\ndoubt that the federal court must dismiss the motion because it lacks\njurisdiction to decide matters unrelated to the scope of the original decree. If\nthe court had no power to decide a new controversy through the medium of an\nold, unrelated decree, surely it has no power to order the state, under the guise\nof the original decree and without any new finding of illegal activity, to begin\nmassive reporting on rat populations and control throughout the prison\nsystem. The DOJ here is chasing rats.\n      The court’s order, imposing a vast and intrusive reporting regime on the\nState without any finding of unconstitutional conduct related to the Brumfield\nlitigation, much less the filing of a proper lawsuit, “was so affected by\nfundamental infirmity” that the infirmity was properly raised after judgment,\nEspinosa, 559 U.S. at 570, 130 S. Ct. at 1377, and the court acted without\njurisdiction and “in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.” Williams,\n728 F.2d at 735.\n                                   CONCLUSION\n      DOJ’s attempt to shoehorn its regulation of the voucher program into an\nentirely unrelated forty-year-old case represents more than ineffective\nlawyering. Despite the district court’s contrary conclusion, it seems plain that\nDOJ’s expressed concern—how the voucher program affects statewide public\nschools racially—has nothing to do with the narrow issues considered in the\nBrumfield litigation. DOJ’s bold strategy, if upheld, would circumvent the\nordinary litigation process in two ways. The reports it seeks do not fall under\n                                       24\n\f   Case: 14-31010     Document: 00513266028       Page: 25    Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-31010\nthe auspices of discovery permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nwhich authorize the compelled production of information only after a complaint\nalleges violations of law. Here, there was no complaint, hence no basis for DOJ\nto intrude into the affairs of Louisiana and its disadvantaged student\npopulation. American discovery follows the common law adversary process,\nnot the civil law’s inquisitorial process, yet DOJ seeks to be the inquisitor.\nEven more disturbing, DOJ’s motion, as explained in the November 2013\nhearing, essentially foretells its attempt—through pre-award “back and forth”\nwith the state on every single voucher—to regulate the program without any\nlegal judgment against the state. This court may not speculate why DOJ chose\nto avoid the path of litigation to prove a violation and thereafter enforce a\nremedy against the state and its school children. What is clear is that DOJ\nchose an unauthorized means to accomplish the same result.\n      The district court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the\nDOJ’s motion for further relief, which was outside the continuing jurisdiction\nof the 1975 order and the 1985 consent decree. Therefore, the April Order is\nvoid and the denial of the 60(b)(4) motion is reversed.\n      For the foregoing reasons, the April 2014 order of the district court is\nREVERSED,       the   injunctive    requirements     for     “further   relief”   are\nDISSOLVED, and the case is remanded with instructions to DISMISS the\nMotion for Further Relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028      Page: 26   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n\n\nGREGG COSTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n      Louisiana, with post-Katrina New Orleans leading the way, has become\nan important, and early studies show successful, 1 laboratory for education\nreform. One of those reforms provides scholarships to low-income students to\nenable them to attend better schools, the type of schools that most lawyers take\nfor granted that their children will attend.       Whether those students will\ncontinue to receive those “dynamic educational opportunities” (Maj. Op. at 1–\n2) is not at issue in this appeal. The ruling that the Intervenors challenge did\nnot prevent the students from receiving scholarships for the 2014–15 school\nyear or the current one. What the district court did was order that the State\nof Louisiana turn over demographic information about enrollment to the\nDepartment of Justice, which wants to determine if the voucher program will\nhave a negative effect on schools subject to desegregation plans. For two\nreasons, that is not a decision that we should review given the procedural\nposture in which this appeal arises.\n      First, I have significant doubts that the Intervenors have standing to\nbring this appeal.

So the case for standing rests on a long chain of events that perhaps\nmight lead one day to a ruling that would result in the injury of losing the\nscholarships: 1) the data would have to provide some arguable basis for\nconcluding that the scholarship program is increasing segregation; 2) the\nDepartment of Justice (which by this point would likely be part of a different\nAdministration) would have to seek to enjoin the scholarship program based\non this data; 3) the district court would have to grant the motion.

As already mentioned, both in this\ncircuit and others, those types of jurisdictional error are limited to when a court\n“lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties.” 3 11 Charles Alan\nWright & Arthur Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2862 (3d ed.);\nsee also 12 James Wm. Moore, MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE § 60.44[1][a] (“A\njudgment is valid whenever the court that renders it has jurisdiction over the\nsubject matter and the parties.            In other words, a judgment is void, and\ntherefore subject to relief under Rule 60(b)(4), ‘only in the rare instance where\na judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a\nviolation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be\nheard.’”) (internal citation omitted). 4 We thus have recognized that even when\na court lacked authority, or one might colloquially say “jurisdiction,” to take a\ncertain action, Rule 60(b)(4) is not an avenue for relief.\n       Callon Petroleum was a case brought in federal court to recover on a\nbond.

On this point, the majority opinion is correct that Espinosa did not\nspecifically refer to subject matter or personal jurisdiction when mentioning the “type of\njurisdictional error” correctable under Rule 60(b)(4). Notably, however, it cited with approval\nthese sections of the two leading federal procedure treatises that characterize those two types\nof jurisdiction as the only ones that warrant Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Espinosa, 559 U.S. at 269.\nMore importantly, the lack of a more direct Supreme Court holding on this question is of no\nmoment when our own case law recognizes the limitation. See Callon Petroleum, 351 F.3d at\n208.\n                                                  29\n\f    Case: 14-31010    Document: 00513266028       Page: 30   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                  No. 14-31010\n\n\ncourt delinquency proceeding for the defendant had commenced, which\nresulted in entry of an order that it was later argued prevented the federal\ncourt from entering judgment. The federal court’s diversity jurisdiction was\nenough to defeat the Rule 60(b)(4) motion even though we noted that Burford\nabstention was probably appropriate given the state insolvency proceeding.\nCallon Petroleum, 351 F.3d at 208–09.\n      Just as the existence of diversity jurisdiction in Callon Petroleum was\nenough to defeat the Rule 60(b)(4) motion, the existence of federal question\njurisdiction in this section 1983 case that was filed more than four decades ago\nshould end our inquiry. That is true even if the court here, as the majority\nopinion concludes, went beyond its equitable powers in ordering the state to\nproduce the data.

The Court explained that Rule 60(b)(4) relief was not warranted\n\n                                          32\n\f    Case: 14-31010       Document: 00513266028          Page: 33     Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                       No. 14-31010\n\n\nbecause the Bankruptcy Code “requirement that a bankruptcy court find\nundue hardship before discharging a student loan debt is a precondition to\nobtaining a discharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court's\njurisdiction.”    Espinosa, 559 U.S. at 272. The relief the bankruptcy court\nordered—discharge of the student loan without a hardship finding—was thus\nunlawful, but that did not render the judgment void. The same is true here,\neven if the majority opinion is correct that the relief ordered by the district\ncourt was unlawful.\n       Espinosa also explains why it is important to preserve the limited\nmeaning of a “void judgment”:\n       Although the term ‘void’ describes a result, rather than the conditions\n       that render a judgment unenforceable, it suffices to say that a void\n       judgment is one so affected by a fundamental infirmity that the infirmity\n       may be raised even after the judgment becomes final. The list of such\n       infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise, Rule 60(b)(4)’s exception to\n       finality would swallow the rule.\n\nId. at 270. 8 That interest in finality, along with the interest in restraint, is\nparticularly strong here. The students are receiving the scholarships, the\nDepartment of Justice was getting the data it wanted, and the State did not\nsee the need to appeal with its program intact.\n       The majority opinion’s “rats” hypothetical undoubtedly describes an\nextreme abuse of judicial authority. But courts act outside the scope of their\nauthority all the time, sometimes outrageously so but more often as a result of\nthe difficulty and variety of the issues we face. It would likewise be a flagrant\nviolation of the law for a court to award a $100 million punitive damages award\n\n\n\n       8 Expanding the reach of Rule 60(b)(4) makes even less sense in the context of an\ninjunction because Rule 60(b)(5) provides a mechanism for relief when an injunction in a\nlong-running institutional reform case like this one “is no longer equitable.” Fed.

The same would be true for the rat court’s abuse of its remedial\npower. That error, like all others including the unauthorized desegregation\norders the majority opinion cites, is correctable on direct appeal. But it is not\namong the errors that can be asserted under the “rare” 60(b)(4) procedure.\nEspinosa, 559 U.S. at 271.\n      The majority opinion may well be correct that the Department of Justice\nshould have litigated this issue in the numerous school desegregation cases\nstill pending in Louisiana federal courts rather than this one that focused on\nstate aid to segregation academies. And the statistics showing that 85% of the\nscholarship recipients are African-American indicate that not just its litigation\nstrategy, but also its concern about the potential effect of the voucher program\non desegregation may have proven misguided.                But vigilance about\nretrenchment in the area of school desegregation is not. See Marguerite L.\nSpencer and Rebecca Reno, The Benefits of Racial and Economic Integration\nin Our Education System: Why This Matters for Our Democracy, Kirwan\nInstitute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, The Ohio State University (Feb.\n2009) at 13 (“The number of nearly all-minority schools (defined as a school\nwhere fewer than 5% of the students are white) doubled between 1993–2006.\n                                       34\n\f   Case: 14-31010        Document: 00513266028    Page: 35   Date Filed: 11/10/2015\n\n\n                                   No. 14-31010\n\n\n… In 2005–2006, 56% of Hispanic students attended a school in which at least\nhalf of the student population was Hispanic, and nearly 50% of black students\nattended a majority black school.”). For the years of blood, sweat, and tears\nthat went into the efforts to achieve desegregation didn’t just help us finally\nrealize the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment. That work also resulted in\nintegrated schools—albeit too few and too short-lived—that provided\nsubstantial gains for minority students. See, e.g., id. at 13 (“[D]esegregation\nhas been positively linked to increases in black student achievement levels,\ngenerating gains on average of .57 of a grade year at the kindergarten level,\nand on average of .3 of a grade year in student performance at the\nelementary/secondary school level. . . . Some argue that since most school\nreforms have little or no effect on improving students’ outcomes, the modest\nimpact that desegregation has on student achievement relative to these other\nreforms is substantial.”); Rucker C. Johnson, Long-Run Impacts of School\nDesegregation & School Quality on Adult Attainments, National Bureau of\nEconomic Research Working Paper 16664 (Jan. 2011) 35 (study of over 8,000\npeople born between 1945 and 1968, tracked through 2011, which concluded\nthat “school desegregation significantly increased educational attainment\namong blacks exposed to desegregation during their school-age years, with\nimpacts found on the likelihood of graduating from high school, completed\nyears of schooling, attending college, graduating with a 4-year college degree,\nand college quality”).\n      In light of the standing and Rule 60(b)(4) obstacles to our review,\nhowever, I would leave to another day—a day that is very unlikely to ever\narrive—the issues concerning the scope of the district court’s equitable power\nto address concerns about desegregation in this proceeding.\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\f</pre>",
