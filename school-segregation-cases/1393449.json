Plaintiff Jayshawn Douglas claims that the District’s refusal to allow Mr. Douglas\n\naccess to his educational placement violated the “stay-put” provision, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j), of the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The District\n\nmoves to dismiss on the grounds that (1) this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Mr.\n\nDouglas failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the IDEA; and (2) the complaint\n\nfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Because Mr. Douglas has already been\n\ngranted relief as to his Section 1415(j) claim, only the Section 1983 claim remains. Upon careful\n\nconsideration of the parties’ arguments, the relevant legal authorities, and pertinent portions of\n\nthe record in this case, the Court will grant the District’s motion and dismiss this action with\n\nprejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 1\n\n\n\n        1\n               The papers reviewed in connection with the pending motion include the\nfollowing: plaintiff’s complaint (“Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 1]; plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary\n\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n               The facts alleged in the complaint, which the Court treats as true for purposes of\n\nthis motion, are as follows. Mr. Douglas is a student with disabilities who has been classified as\n\n“Other Health Impaired” under the IDEA. Compl. ¶ 8. 2 In May 2013, Mr. Douglas’\n\nindividualized education program (“IEP”) team established Dunbar Senior High School\n\n(“Dunbar”), his “neighborhood school,” as his educational placement and location of services.\n\nCompl. ¶ 12-13, 14. In accordance with the IEP, Mr. Douglas attended Dunbar during the\n\n2012-2013 school year, but failed the ninth grade. Id. ¶ 11.\n\n               In July 2013, Dunbar announced a policy to “segregate[]” repeating ninth graders,\n\nlike Mr. Douglas, from first-time ninth graders and place repeating students into “twilight\n\nacademies.” Compl. ¶ 16. On several occasions in Fall 2013, Mr. Douglas attempted to attend\n\nDunbar “but was refused admission by Dunbar’s administration” allegedly under the direction of\n\nDunbar’s principal, Mr. Jackson. Id. ¶¶ 18-19. Over the first few months of the 2013 school\n\nyear, D.C. Superior Court Probation Officer Steve Dean attempted to intervene on Mr. Douglas’\n\nbehalf, accompanying him to Dunbar; but the school continued to bar Mr. Douglas from\n\nattending class, despite reassurances from the D.C. Mayor’s Liaison that Mr. Douglas “was\n\n\ninjunction (“PI Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 3]; plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order\n(“TRO Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 2]; the Court’s Memorandum Opinion of November 14, 2013 granting a\n“stay-put” order (“Mem. Op.”) [Dkt. No. 8]; defendant’s motion to dismiss (“Def.’s Mot.\nDismiss”) [Dkt. No. 12]; plaintiff’s memorandum in opposition to defendant’s motion to dismiss\n(Pl.’s Opp.) [Dkt. No. 13].\n       2\n               Plaintiff, both in the body of his complaint and the prayer for relief, has numbered\nthe relevant paragraphs starting at 1, such that plaintiff’s complaint contains two paragraphs that\nare numbered “1,” “2,” etc. For clarity, the Court therefore specifies the prayer for relief\nparagraphs separately.\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fentitled to attend Dunbar and should be admitted upon arrival.” Id. ¶¶ 20-21 (citing Compl.\n\nEx. 6).\n\n               On October 28, 2013, Mr. Douglas filed an administrative due process complaint\n\nwith the District of Columbia’s Office of the State Superintendent for Education’s Student\n\nHearing Office. Compl. ¶¶ 22-23 (citing Compl. Ex. 7). The administrative complaint invoked\n\nMr. Douglas’ “stay-put” rights under 34 C.F.R. § 300.518(a). Id. Although a hearing officer had\n\nbeen assigned to his administrative complaint, Mr. Douglas filed the instant complaint in this\n\nCourt on November 7, 2013. Id. ¶¶ 24-25. The complaint has brought two claims. First, Mr.\n\nDouglas alleges that the District violated IDEA’s “stay-put” provision, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j); and\n\nsecond, he claims that the District denied his due process right to a free and appropriate public\n\neducation, constituting a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. ¶¶ 42-52. Mr. Douglas sought a\n\n“stay-put” order and an award of $100,000 in compensatory damages. Id. at Prayer for Relief\n\n¶¶ 1-2.\n\n               Mr. Douglas simultaneously filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a\n\nmotion for a temporary restraining order, both also seeking the “stay-put” order sought in Count\n\nOne of the complaint. See PI Mot.; TRO Mot. After hearing oral argument on November 13,\n\n2013, the Court granted Mr. Douglas’ motion for a preliminary injunction, entering a “stay-put”\n\norder for the pendency of the administrative procedure, and denied as moot his motion for a\n\ntemporary restraining order. See Mem. Op. at 1. 3 Shortly thereafter, the District filed this\n\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the\n\nalternative, Rule 12(b)(6). See Def.’s Mot. Dismiss at 2.\n\n\n\n          3\n               The Court notes that, because he received full relief, Mr. Douglas’ Section\n1415(j) claim has been fully adjudicated and satisfied. This claim is no longer before the Court\nand is not discussed in this Memorandum Opinion.\n                                                 3\n\f                                    II.   LEGAL STANDARD\n\n                              Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1)\n\n               Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, with the ability to hear only cases\n\nentrusted to them by a grant of power contained either in the Constitution or in an act of\n\nCongress. See, e.g., Beethoven.com LLC v. Librarian of Congress, 394 F.3d 939, 945\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2005); Tabman v. F.B.I., 718 F. Supp. 2d 98, 100 (D.D.C. 2010). On a motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that\n\nthe Court has jurisdiction. See Tabman v. F.B.I., 718 F. Supp. 2d at 100; Brady Campaign to\n\nPrevent Gun Violence v. Ashcroft, 339 F. Supp. 2d 68, 72 (D.D.C. 2004). In determining\n\nwhether to grant such a motion, the Court must construe the complaint in the plaintiff’s favor and\n\ntreat all well-pled allegations of fact as true. See Jerome Stevens Pharms., Inc. v. F.D.A., 402\n\nF.3d 1249, 1253-54 (D.C. Cir. 2005). But the Court need not accept unsupported inferences or\n\nlegal conclusions cast as factual allegations. See Primax Recoveries, Inc. v. Lee, 260 F. Supp.\n\n2d 43, 47 (D.D.C. 2003). The Court may dispose of the motion on the basis of the complaint\n\nalone or it may consider materials beyond the pleadings “as it deems appropriate to resolve the\n\nquestion whether it has jurisdiction to hear the case.” Scolaro v. D.C. Board of\n\nElections & Ethics, 104 F. Supp. 2d 18, 22 (D.D.C. 2000); see also Coalition for Underground\n\nExpansion v. Mineta, 333 F.3d 193, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n\n                                          III. DISCUSSION\n\n               Under the IDEA, this Court “has no subject matter jurisdiction over an IDEA\n\nclaim that has not first been pursued through administrative channels.” Douglass v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 750 F. Supp. 2d 54, 60-61 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Massey v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f400 F. Supp. 2d 66, 70 (D.D.C.2005)). This exhaustion requirement applies not only to claims\n\nbrought directly under the IDEA itself, but to any claims for relief available under the IDEA,\n\nregardless of their statutory basis. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l); see Douglass v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n605 F. Supp. 2d 156, 166 (D.D.C. 2009) (holding that a “[p]laintiff’s claim under Section 1983 is\n\nalso subject to the IDEA’s exhaustion requirement to the extent the claim ‘seek[s] relief that is\n\nalso available under’ the IDEA”). To excuse a failure to exhaust, the plaintiff must demonstrate\n\nthe futility or inadequacy of the administrative process. Id. at 165 (citing Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S.\n\n305, 326–27 (1988)). In this Circuit, such exceptions to the exhaustion requirement are narrowly\n\nconstrued and found “only in the most exceptional circumstances.” Douglass v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 750 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (quoting Commc’ns Workers of Am. v. AT&T, 40 F.3d 426,\n\n432 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).\n\n               Mr. Douglas’ claim, although brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, is predicated on\n\nthe District’s failure to provide Mr. Douglas with an appropriate public education, as required by\n\nthe IDEA. Compl. ¶ 49. 4 Although Mr. Douglas seeks $100,000 in compensatory damages,\n\nPrayer for Relief ¶ 2, which are unavailable under the IDEA, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)-(k), he\n\ncannot “skirt the administrative remedies provided for in the IDEA simply by adding a claim for\n\nmonetary relief.” Douglass v. District of Columbia, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 167. The claim therefore\n\nis subject to IDEA’s exhaustion requirement. Given the fact that this complaint was filed a mere\n\nten days after Mr. Douglas filed his administrative complaint, and before an administrative due\n\nprocess hearing had been scheduled, Mr. Douglas clearly did not exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies before pursuing relief in this Court. See Compl. ¶¶ 22-29; Douglass v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 166. Mr. Douglas does not dispute this fact. See Pl.’s Opp. at 3-5.\n\n       4\n             As noted previously, only the Section 1983 claim remains before the Court\nbecause Mr. Douglas has received full relief on his Section 1415(j) claim. See supra at 3 n.3.\n                                                 5\n\fNor does he argue that exhausting his administrative remedies would have been futile or\n\ninadequate. See id.\n\n               Mr. Douglas counters that he was not required to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies because a “request for a Stay Put Injunction is an exception to the general rule . . . .”\n\nId. This assertion is correct, but irrelevant. The exception to the administrative exhaustion\n\nrequirement applied to Mr. Douglas’ Section 1415(j) claim, on which he already has received\n\nrelief. Mem. Op. at 2-3, 6. But this exception does not extend to Mr. Douglas’ Section 1983\n\nclaim. See Alston v. Dist. of Columbia, 439 F. Supp. 2d 86, 91 (D.D.C. 2006) (noting that “[t]he\n\nreasoning behind [the exception] is that “[t]he administrative process is ‘inadequate’ to remedy\n\nviolations of § 1415(j)”) (quoting Murphy v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. Of Educ., 297 F.3d\n\n195, 199 (2d Cir. 2000)). The exhaustion requirement therefore applies and deprives this Court\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction. The Court will grant the District’s motion to dismiss under Rule\n\n12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because the Court finds it lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction over Mr. Douglas’ claim, it will not reach the District’s arguments that Mr. Douglas\n\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the District’s motion and dismiss\n\nthis action with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. An Order consistent with this\n\nMemorandum Opinion shall issue this same day.\n\n\n\n                                                              /s/________________________\n                                                              PAUL L.

Plaintiff Jayshawn Douglas claims that the District’s refusal to allow Mr. Douglas\n\naccess to his educational placement violated the “stay-put” provision, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j), of the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The District\n\nmoves to dismiss on the grounds that (1) this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Mr.\n\nDouglas failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the IDEA; and (2) the complaint\n\nfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Because Mr. Douglas has already been\n\ngranted relief as to his Section 1415(j) claim, only the Section 1983 claim remains. Upon careful\n\nconsideration of the parties’ arguments, the relevant legal authorities, and pertinent portions of\n\nthe record in this case, the Court will grant the District’s motion and dismiss this action with\n\nprejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 1\n\n\n\n        1\n               The papers reviewed in connection with the pending motion include the\nfollowing: plaintiff’s complaint (“Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 1]; plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary\n\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n               The facts alleged in the complaint, which the Court treats as true for purposes of\n\nthis motion, are as follows. Mr. Douglas is a student with disabilities who has been classified as\n\n“Other Health Impaired” under the IDEA. Compl. ¶ 8. 2 In May 2013, Mr. Douglas’\n\nindividualized education program (“IEP”) team established Dunbar Senior High School\n\n(“Dunbar”), his “neighborhood school,” as his educational placement and location of services.\n\nCompl. ¶ 12-13, 14. In accordance with the IEP, Mr. Douglas attended Dunbar during the\n\n2012-2013 school year, but failed the ninth grade. Id. ¶ 11.\n\n               In July 2013, Dunbar announced a policy to “segregate[]” repeating ninth graders,\n\nlike Mr. Douglas, from first-time ninth graders and place repeating students into “twilight\n\nacademies.” Compl. ¶ 16. On several occasions in Fall 2013, Mr. Douglas attempted to attend\n\nDunbar “but was refused admission by Dunbar’s administration” allegedly under the direction of\n\nDunbar’s principal, Mr. Jackson. Id. ¶¶ 18-19. Over the first few months of the 2013 school\n\nyear, D.C. Superior Court Probation Officer Steve Dean attempted to intervene on Mr. Douglas’\n\nbehalf, accompanying him to Dunbar; but the school continued to bar Mr. Douglas from\n\nattending class, despite reassurances from the D.C. Mayor’s Liaison that Mr. Douglas “was\n\n\ninjunction (“PI Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 3]; plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order\n(“TRO Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 2]; the Court’s Memorandum Opinion of November 14, 2013 granting a\n“stay-put” order (“Mem. Op.”) [Dkt. No. 8]; defendant’s motion to dismiss (“Def.’s Mot.\nDismiss”) [Dkt. No. 12]; plaintiff’s memorandum in opposition to defendant’s motion to dismiss\n(Pl.’s Opp.) [Dkt. No. 13].\n       2\n               Plaintiff, both in the body of his complaint and the prayer for relief, has numbered\nthe relevant paragraphs starting at 1, such that plaintiff’s complaint contains two paragraphs that\nare numbered “1,” “2,” etc. For clarity, the Court therefore specifies the prayer for relief\nparagraphs separately.\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fentitled to attend Dunbar and should be admitted upon arrival.” Id. ¶¶ 20-21 (citing Compl.\n\nEx. 6).\n\n               On October 28, 2013, Mr. Douglas filed an administrative due process complaint\n\nwith the District of Columbia’s Office of the State Superintendent for Education’s Student\n\nHearing Office. Compl. ¶¶ 22-23 (citing Compl. Ex. 7). The administrative complaint invoked\n\nMr. Douglas’ “stay-put” rights under 34 C.F.R. § 300.518(a). Id. Although a hearing officer had\n\nbeen assigned to his administrative complaint, Mr. Douglas filed the instant complaint in this\n\nCourt on November 7, 2013. Id. ¶¶ 24-25. The complaint has brought two claims. First, Mr.\n\nDouglas alleges that the District violated IDEA’s “stay-put” provision, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j); and\n\nsecond, he claims that the District denied his due process right to a free and appropriate public\n\neducation, constituting a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. ¶¶ 42-52. Mr. Douglas sought a\n\n“stay-put” order and an award of $100,000 in compensatory damages. Id. at Prayer for Relief\n\n¶¶ 1-2.\n\n               Mr. Douglas simultaneously filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a\n\nmotion for a temporary restraining order, both also seeking the “stay-put” order sought in Count\n\nOne of the complaint. See PI Mot.; TRO Mot. After hearing oral argument on November 13,\n\n2013, the Court granted Mr. Douglas’ motion for a preliminary injunction, entering a “stay-put”\n\norder for the pendency of the administrative procedure, and denied as moot his motion for a\n\ntemporary restraining order. See Mem. Op. at 1. 3 Shortly thereafter, the District filed this\n\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the\n\nalternative, Rule 12(b)(6). See Def.’s Mot. Dismiss at 2.\n\n\n\n          3\n               The Court notes that, because he received full relief, Mr. Douglas’ Section\n1415(j) claim has been fully adjudicated and satisfied. This claim is no longer before the Court\nand is not discussed in this Memorandum Opinion.\n                                                 3\n\f                                    II.   LEGAL STANDARD\n\n                              Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1)\n\n               Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, with the ability to hear only cases\n\nentrusted to them by a grant of power contained either in the Constitution or in an act of\n\nCongress.

DISCUSSION\n\n               Under the IDEA, this Court “has no subject matter jurisdiction over an IDEA\n\nclaim that has not first been pursued through administrative channels.” Douglass v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2474257\"><a href=\"/opinion/2474257/douglass-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60-61 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Massey v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414061\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414061/massey-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70 (D.D.C.2005)). This exhaustion requirement applies not only to claims\n\nbrought directly under the IDEA itself, but to any claims for relief available under the IDEA,\n\nregardless of their statutory basis. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l); see Douglass v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1658706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1658706/douglass-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166 (D.D.C. 2009) (holding that a “[p]laintiff’s claim under Section 1983 is\n\nalso subject to the IDEA’s exhaustion requirement to the extent the claim ‘seek[s] relief that is\n\nalso available under’ the IDEA”). To excuse a failure to exhaust, the plaintiff must demonstrate\n\nthe futility or inadequacy of the administrative process. Id. at 165 (citing Honig v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111982\"><a href=\"/opinion/111982/honig-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326–27 (1988)). In this Circuit, such exceptions to the exhaustion requirement are narrowly\n\nconstrued and found “only in the most exceptional circumstances.” Douglass v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 750 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (quoting Commc’ns Workers of Am. v. AT&T, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682707\"><a href=\"/opinion/682707/communications-workers-of-america-lyle-wingate-v-american-telephone-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n432 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).\n\n               Mr. Douglas’ claim, although brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, is predicated on\n\nthe District’s failure to provide Mr. Douglas with an appropriate public education, as required by\n\nthe IDEA. Compl. ¶ 49. 4 Although Mr. Douglas seeks $100,000 in compensatory damages,\n\nPrayer for Relief ¶ 2, which are unavailable under the IDEA, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)-(k), he\n\ncannot “skirt the administrative remedies provided for in the IDEA simply by adding a claim for\n\nmonetary relief.” Douglass v. District of Columbia, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 167. The claim therefore\n\nis subject to IDEA’s exhaustion requirement. Given the fact that this complaint was filed a mere\n\nten days after Mr. Douglas filed his administrative complaint, and before an administrative due\n\nprocess hearing had been scheduled, Mr. Douglas clearly did not exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies before pursuing relief in this Court. See Compl. ¶¶ 22-29; Douglass v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 166. Mr. Douglas does not dispute this fact. See Pl.’s Opp. at 3-5.\n\n       4\n             As noted previously, only the Section 1983 claim remains before the Court\nbecause Mr. Douglas has received full relief on his Section 1415(j) claim. See supra at 3 n.3.\n                                                 5\n\fNor does he argue that exhausting his administrative remedies would have been futile or\n\ninadequate. See id.\n\n               Mr. Douglas counters that he was not required to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies because a “request for a Stay Put Injunction is an exception to the general rule . . . .”\n\nId. This assertion is correct, but irrelevant. The exception to the administrative exhaustion\n\nrequirement applied to Mr. Douglas’ Section 1415(j) claim, on which he already has received\n\nrelief. Mem. Op. at 2-3, 6. But this exception does not extend to Mr. Douglas’ Section 1983\n\nclaim. See Alston v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2495590\"><a href=\"/opinion/2495590/alston-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (D.D.C. 2006) (noting that “[t]he\n\nreasoning behind [the exception] is that “[t]he administrative process is ‘inadequate’ to remedy\n\nviolations of § 1415(j)”) (quoting Murphy v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. Of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (2d Cir. 2000)). The exhaustion requirement therefore applies and deprives this Court\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction. The Court will grant the District’s motion to dismiss under Rule\n\n12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because the Court finds it lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction over Mr. Douglas’ claim, it will not reach the District’s arguments that Mr. Douglas\n\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the District’s motion and dismiss\n\nthis action with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. An Order consistent with this\n\nMemorandum Opinion shall issue this same day.\n\n\n\n                                                              /s/________________________\n                                                              PAUL L.
