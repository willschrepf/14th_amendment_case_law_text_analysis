Background\n\n\n\n        The sole remaining issue in this school desegregation case -- on appeal for\n\nthe second time -- is the lawfulness of the School District’s policy of “ability\n\n\n\n    *\n     Honorable John R. Gibson, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\n                                             2\n\fgrouping” or “tracking” by which the School District groups students into\n\ndifferent academic tracks based on their abilities. The School District has used\n\nsome form of ability grouping since the end of de jure segregation. Under the\n\nSchool District’s program, teachers first group students in kindergarten and\n\nelementary school based on their perceived abilities and actual performance. In\n\nmiddle school, students are placed into classes based mainly on standardized exam\n\nscores as well as the performance level recommendations of former teachers.1 At\n\nthe high school level, students choose their own courses under the direction of\n\nteachers, counselors, and parents.\n\n          During a lengthy bench trial, the district court made detailed findings of fact\n\nabout the racial composition of the School District’s schools and classes2 as well\n\nas the possible segregative effects of many of the School District’s programs and\n\npolicies, including ability grouping.3 The district court found that many areas of\n\nthe School District’s operations exhibited racial imbalances but that each of these\n\n\n\n      1\n    The School District offered testimony that school officials also attempt to accommodate the\nrequests of parents in making classroom placements.\n  2\n   The district court examined racial disparities in the populations of students, faculty, and staff at\neach of the schools and several of the classes.\n   3\n     The court looked at several of the District’s programs and policies including ability grouping,\ngifted education, special education, administration of discipline, facilities, transportation, and\nextracurricular activities.\n\n                                                  3\n\fimbalances was neither traceable to prior de jure segregation nor the result of\n\npresent intentional discrimination. Thomas County Branch of NAACP v. City of\n\nThomasville Sch. Dist., 299 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1367 (M.D. Ga. 2004). For each\n\narea, the district court determined that demographic and other external factors\n\nwere the causes of the imbalances. The district court concluded that Plaintiffs had\n\nshown no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment or Title VI. Id. at 1367.\n\n       In examining ability grouping, the district court found that “a\n\ndisproportionate number of low income children (most of whom happen to be\n\nblack) are placed in the lower ability groups” and tend to remain in these lower\n\ntracks throughout their academic careers. Id. at 1358. The court determined that\n\nthis disparity was the result of these students’ “impoverished environment” in\n\nwhich “they do not receive the background and support that is often so critical for\n\nbeing ready to learn.”4 Id. The court then concluded that the ability-grouping\n\nprogram did not intentionally segregate or discriminate against students on the\n\nbasis of race. Id. at 1359.\n\n\n\n\n  4\n   The district court commented that “[w]hen the racial makeup of a community correlates directly\nwith poverty and when poverty correlates with perceived academic readiness, as it does in\nThomasville, this ‘ability tracking’ inevitably leads to ability groups that are racially imbalanced.”\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1359.\n\n                                                  4\n\f       On an appeal to this Court, we affirmed each aspect of the district court’s\n\norder except for the findings of fact and conclusions of law on the School\n\nDistrict’s ability-grouping program. Holton v. City of Thomasville Sch. Dist., 425\n\nF.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir. 2005) (“Holton I”). Because the district court focused\n\nits analysis on whether the ability-grouping program was intentionally\n\ndiscriminatory, we concluded that the district court had failed to apply the correct\n\nlegal standard as set out in McNeal v. Tate County Sch. Dist., 508 F.2d 1017,\n\n1020 (5th Cir. 1975). That standard allows a school district to implement ability-\n\ngrouping programs “in spite of any segregative effect they may have if the\n\nassignment method ‘is not based on the present results of past segregation or will\n\nremedy such results through better educational opportunities.” Holton I, 425 F.3d\n\nat 1347 (quoting McNeal, 508 F.2d at 1020) (emphasis added). We remanded for\n\nthe district court to apply the McNeal standard and to make new findings of fact\n\non the School District’s ability grouping program.5 Id. at 1348, 1355.\n\n       On remand, the district court acknowledged its earlier lack of complete\n\nsuccess in expressing and applying the McNeal standard. The district court then\n\nexplained that it had earlier determined (1) “that the [racial] imbalances were the\n\n\n  5\n    This Court concluded that new findings of fact on the ability-grouping program were necessary --\nin the light of the McNeal standard -- because failure to apply the correct standard may have tainted\nthe district court’s earlier factual findings. Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1355.\n\n                                                 5\n\fresult of the ability-grouping system used by the schools”; (2) “that the children\n\nwere grouped in that system based on their perceived ability”; and (3) “that this\n\nability was based upon their impoverished circumstances more than anything else\n\nand was certainly not traceable to the de jure segregated school system.”\n\nAlthough the district court viewed its earlier analysis as having applied the\n\nsubstance of McNeal, the district court this time correctly stated the McNeal\n\nstandard, adopted and incorporated its previous factual findings, made some\n\nadditional findings,6 and applied the McNeal standard to the sum of those\n\nfindings. The district court concluded that the School District’s placement of\n\nblack children into lower ability groups is not based on the present results of past\n\nsegregation.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    The district court also found (1) “that no child attending District schools at the time of trial had\never been enrolled in the District’s previous de jure racially segregated system”; and (2) “that the\nachievement level of the black children in the certified class who have been placed in the lower\nachievement groups is not a result of the previous de jure segregated school system.” Plaintiffs argue\nthat the first finding attempts to reduce McNeal to a “mere counting exercise.” That finding,\nhowever, was important to the district court’s conclusion that the continuous use of ability grouping\nsince the end of de jure segregation did not pose a constitutional problem. In Ga. NAACP v.\nGeorgia, 775 F.2d 1403 (11th Cir. 1985), as in this case, the plaintiffs pointed to the continuous use\nof ability grouping since the end of de jure segregation as evidence of the perpetuation of de jure\nsegregation. In Ga. NAACP, we recognized that the McNeal court’s concern for students who had\nattended inferior segregated schools was the basis for the court’s reasoning that school districts must\noperate as a “unitary system” for a time before using an ability-grouping scheme that causes racial\nimbalance. Id. at 1415. That reasoning, we said, does not apply in situations where no student in\nthe current certified class had ever attended a segregated school. Id.\n\n                                                   6\n\f                               II. Standard of Review\n\n\n\n      We review a district court’s application and interpretation of law de novo\n\nand factual findings for clear error. NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v. Duval\n\nCounty Sch., 273 F.3d 960, 965 (11th Cir. 2001); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). The clear-\n\nerror standard governs unless the district court “applies an incorrect legal standard\n\nwhich taints or infects its findings of facts.” Id. at 965.\n\n\n\n                                    III. Discussion\n\n\n\n      Plaintiffs argue on appeal (1) that the district court again failed to apply the\n\nMcNeal standard correctly in reviewing the School District’s practice of ability\n\ngrouping; (2) that the district court failed to make new findings of fact on\n\nintentional discrimination as ordered by this Court; and (3) that the ability\n\ngrouping program is intentionally discriminatory, and the findings to the contrary\n\nare clearly erroneous. We conclude (1) that the district court correctly applied the\n\nMcNeal standard; (2) that the district court complied with our direction to make\n\nnew factual findings in the light of the McNeal standard; and (3) that the district\n\n                                            7\n\fcourt did not clearly err by finding that the ability-grouping program was neither\n\nintentionally discriminatory nor based on the present results of past segregation.\n\n         “A school district’s obligation is to eliminate the vestiges of past\n\ndiscrimination ‘to the extent practicable.’” Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1337 (citation\n\nomitted). If a plaintiff can show that current racial imbalances exist within a\n\nschool system, “[t]he burden then shifts to the school district to demonstrate that\n\nthe racial imbalances are ‘not the result of present or past discriminatory action on\n\n[its] part.’” Id. at 1338 (citation omitted). “The school district bears the burden of\n\nshowing that any current [racial] imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to\n\nthe prior [de jure segregated system].” Freeman v. Pitts, 112 S. Ct. 1430, 1448\n\n(1992).\n\n         “If the school district can demonstrate that demographic [or other external]\n\nfactors have ‘substantially caused’ the racial imbalances in its schools, ‘it\n\novercomes the presumption that segregative intent [either past or present] is the\n\ncause, and there is no constitutional violation.” Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1339\n\n(citation omitted).7 But, “for a plaintiff to preserve the presumption of de jure\n\nsegregation [as the cause of the current racial imbalance], the plaintiff must show\n\n\n     7\n     “The school district need not prove that demographic factors are the sole cause of the\nimbalances” but must show that these factors are a substantial cause. Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1339.\n\n\n                                               8\n\fthat the demographic shifts are the result of the prior de jure segregation or some\n\nother discriminatory conduct.” Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n        “Although ability-grouping practices may have the effect of creating racial\n\nimbalances within classrooms, we have ‘consistently stated that ability grouping is\n\nnot per se unconstitutional.’” Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1346 (citation omitted).\n\nAbility-grouping programs “are permissible in spite of any segregative effect they\n\nmay have if the assignment method ‘is not based on the present results of past\n\nsegregation or will remedy such results through better educational opportunities.’”\n\nId. at 1347 (quoting McNeal, 508 F.2d at 1020).8\n\n        In this case, the district court correctly applied the McNeal standard on\n\nremand by asking whether the School District’s method of assignment was based\n\non the present results of past de jure segregation. The district court found that the\n\nSchool District grouped students based on their perceived ability and that the\n\nlesser-perceived ability of black students was “based upon impoverished\n\ncircumstances more than anything.” The district court then explicitly found that\n\n“the achievement level of the black children in the certified class who have been\n\nplaced in the lower achievement groups is not a result of the previous de jure\n\n\n  8\n    The district court did not address -- and the School District does not argue -- whether the ability-\ngrouping program remedies the results of past segregation through better educational opportunities\nfor black students.\n\n                                                   9\n\fsegregated school system.”9 The district court, therefore, found and concluded\n\nthat the assignment method of the ability-grouping program is not based on the\n\npresent results of past segregation.10 Because the district court correctly applied\n\nMcNeal, the district court’s findings are entitled to substantial deference under the\n\nclear-error standard. NAACP, Jacksonville, 273 F.3d at 965.\n\n           After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred\n\nby finding that racial imbalances within the School District’s ability-grouping\n\nprogram are the result of demographic factors (that is, poverty) rather than the\n\npresent effects of past de jure segregation. That the ability-grouping program has\n\nthe effect of placing lower-income black students in lower tracks is, by itself,\n\ninsufficient to show a constitutional violation. Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1347.\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to preserve the presumption that these imbalances are the\n\n\n\n  9\n    Plaintiffs argue that the district court’s analysis on remand was merely an attempt to explain its\nearlier erroneous statement and application of the law. We disagree. The district court did explain\nthat the substance of its earlier reasoning, in effect, conformed with McNeal. Even if the district\ncourt’s explanation was incorrect, the district court then explicitly recognized and applied the\nMcNeal standard, finding that the ability-grouping program was not based on the present results of\npast de jure segregation.\n      10\n      Plaintiffs have argued that the district court did not comply with our mandate to make new\nfindings on whether the ability-grouping program intentionally discriminates against black students.\nWe are satisfied with the district court’s manner of compliance with our directions. On remand, the\ndistrict court stated the McNeal standard accurately and then set out the court’s fact findings in the\nlight of the McNeal standard. That some of these findings were adopted from the district court’s\nearlier opinion and order -- that is, revived -- is acceptable, especially considering the additional\nfindings also made on remand.\n\n                                                 10\n\fresult of past de jure segregation because Plaintiffs have not shown -- nor have\n\nthey attempted to show -- that either these students’ lesser-perceived abilities or\n\ntheir impoverished circumstances are “the result of the prior de jure segregation or\n\nsome other discriminatory conduct.” Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1339.\n\n            Instead, Plaintiffs mainly argue that the ability-grouping program\n\nintentionally discriminates against black students and that racial disparities within\n\nthe program cannot be explained by demographic factors. As support for this\n\nargument, Plaintiffs point to some instances in the record of intentional\n\nsegregation.11 They also provide some statistical data suggesting that race rather\n\nthan ability explains many of the black students’ lower placements and that\n\ndemographic factors cannot be the sole cause of racial imbalances within the\n\nability-grouping program.12\n\n            Evidence in the record, however, supports the district court’s findings (1)\n\nthat the ability-grouping program did not intentionally discriminate against black\n\nstudents; and (2) that a student’s lesser-perceived ability was mainly the result of\n\nthat student’s poverty and that such conditions were not the present results of past\n\n  11\n     Plaintiffs point to some evidence in the record of instances of intentional segregation by school\nofficials in making classroom assignments.\n       12\n      Plaintiffs’ experts provide some statistical data that -- among students who have similar\nstandardized test scores, prior placements, and socio-economic status -- black students tend to be\nplaced in lower academic groupings while white students are placed in higher levels.\n\n                                                 11\n\fde jure segregation. The School District offered testimony to support its position\n\nthat teachers and administrators did not use the ability-grouping program to\n\ndiscriminate intentionally against black students. The School District also argued\n\n-- and, after weighing the evidence, the district court found -- that the placement of\n\nstudents correlates to their perceived abilities and that socio-economic status is a\n\nstrong determinant of a student’s academic ability.13 Once again, the School\n\nDistrict does not have the burden to prove that demographic factors were the sole\n\ncause of the racial imbalances, but rather that such factors were a substantial\n\ncause. Holton I, 425 F.3d at 1339. Also, the district court may examine the\n\nrecord as a whole and need not respond to every piece of conflicting evidence. Id.\n\nat 1353-54. Thus, because the district court’s findings are entitled to substantial\n\ndeference, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred.14\n\n        The district court’s judgment in favor of the District is, therefore, affirmed.\n\n        AFFIRMED.\n\n   13\n      The School District presented testimony that the assignment method was, in fact, based on\nstudents’ perceived abilities as judged by not only standardized tests, but also teachers’ perceptions\nof a student’s past and potential classroom performance. Also, testimony from both Plaintiffs’\nexperts and the School District’s experts suggests a high correlation between poverty and academic\nability.\n  14\n     The Supreme Court has explained that “[a]s the de jure violation becomes more remote in time\nand demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance in a school\ndistrict is a vestige of the prior de jure system.” Freeman, 112 S. Ct. at 1448. The district court\nfound that “the effects of the de jure segregated school system had ended before the children in this\ncase ever entered the school.” We now conclude that this finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\n                                                 12\n\f",

That the ability-grouping program has the <i>effect</i> of placing lower-income black students in lower tracks is, by itself, insufficient to show a constitutional violation. <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1347. Plaintiffs have failed to preserve the presumption that these imbalances are the result of past <i>de jure</i> segregation because Plaintiffs have not shown&#8212; nor have they attempted to show&#8212;that either these students' lesser-perceived abilities or their impoverished circumstances are \"the result of the prior <i>de jure</i> segregation or some other discriminatory conduct.\" <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1339.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Plaintiffs mainly argue that the ability-grouping program intentionally discriminates against black students and that racial disparities within the program cannot be explained by demographic factors. As support for this argument, Plaintiffs point to some instances in the record of intentional segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> They also provide some statistical data suggesting that race rather than ability explains many of the black students' lower placements and that demographic factors cannot be the <i>sole</i> cause of racial imbalances within the ability-grouping program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence in the record, however, supports the district court's findings (1) that the ability-grouping program did not intentionally discriminate against black students; and (2) that a student's lesser-perceived ability was mainly the result of that student's poverty and that such conditions were not the present results of past <i>de jure</i> segregation. The School District offered testimony to support its position that teachers and administrators did not use the ability-grouping program to discriminate intentionally against black students. The School District also argued&#8212; and, after weighing the evidence, the district court found&#8212;that the placement of students correlates to their perceived abilities and that socio-economic status is a strong determinant of a student's academic ability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Once again, the School District does not have the burden to prove that demographic factors were the <i>sole</i> cause of the racial imbalances, but rather that such factors were a <i>substantial</i> cause. <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1339. Also, the district court may examine the record as a whole and need not respond to every piece of conflicting evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 1353-54.

In <i>Ga. NAACP v.

In <i>Ga.

We conclude (1) that the district court correctly applied the <i>McNeal</i> standard; (2) that the district court complied with our direction to make new factual findings in the light of the <i>McNeal</i> standard; and (3) that the district court did not clearly err by finding that the ability-grouping program was neither intentionally discriminatory nor based on the present results of past segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A school district's obligation is to eliminate the vestiges of past discrimination `to the extent practicable.'\" <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1337 (citation omitted).

The district court found that the School District grouped students based on their perceived ability and that the lesser-perceived ability of black students was \"based upon impoverished circumstances more than anything.\" The district court then explicitly found that \"the achievement level of the black children in the certified class who have been placed in the lower achievement groups is not a result of the previous <i>de jure</i> segregated school system.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The district court, therefore, found and concluded that the assignment method of the ability-grouping program is not based on the present results of past segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Because the district court correctly applied <i>McNeal,</i> the district court's findings are entitled to substantial deference under the clear-error standard. <i>NAACP, Jacksonville,</i> 273 F.3d at 965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred by finding that racial imbalances within the School District's ability-grouping program are the result of demographic factors (that is, poverty) rather than the present effects of past <i>de jure</i> segregation. That the ability-grouping program has the <i>effect</i> of placing lower-income black students in lower tracks is, by itself, insufficient to show a constitutional violation. <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1347. Plaintiffs have failed to preserve the presumption that these imbalances are the result of past <i>de jure</i> segregation because Plaintiffs have not shown&#8212; nor have they attempted to show&#8212;that either these students' lesser-perceived abilities or their impoverished circumstances are \"the result of the prior <i>de jure</i> segregation or some other discriminatory conduct.\" <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1339.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Plaintiffs mainly argue that the ability-grouping program intentionally discriminates against black students and that racial disparities within the program cannot be explained by demographic factors. As support for this argument, Plaintiffs point to some instances in the record of intentional segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> They also provide some statistical data suggesting that race rather than ability explains many of the black students' lower placements and that demographic factors cannot be the <i>sole</i> cause of racial imbalances within the ability-grouping program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence in the record, however, supports the district court's findings (1) that the ability-grouping program did not intentionally discriminate against black students; and (2) that a student's lesser-perceived ability was mainly the result of that student's poverty and that such conditions were not the present results of past <i>de jure</i> segregation. The School District offered testimony to support its position that teachers and administrators did not use the ability-grouping program to discriminate intentionally against black students. The School District also argued&#8212; and, after weighing the evidence, the district court found&#8212;that the placement of students correlates to their perceived abilities and that socio-economic status is a strong determinant of a student's academic ability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Once again, the School District does not have the burden to prove that demographic factors were the <i>sole</i> cause of the racial imbalances, but rather that such factors were a <i>substantial</i> cause. <i>Holton I,</i> 425 F.3d at 1339. Also, the district court may examine the record as a whole and need not respond to every piece of conflicting evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 1353-54.

In <i>Ga. NAACP,</i> we recognized that the <i>McNeal</i> court's concern for students who had attended inferior segregated schools was the basis for the court's reasoning that school districts must operate as a \"unitary system\" for a time before using an ability-grouping scheme that causes racial imbalance. <i>Id.</i> at 1415.
