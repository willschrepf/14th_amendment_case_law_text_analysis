The pro se plaintiff, an inmate in the custody\n\nof the Department of Correction, appeals from a judgment of the\n\n\n       1\n       Chief of the Office of Investigative Services.

In his\n\ncomplaint, the plaintiff asserted various claims stemming from\n\nthe defendants' designation of him as a member of the \"Latin\n\nKings,\" a \"security threat group\" (STG).   The plaintiff denies\n\nthat he is a member of the Latin Kings, and that his false\n\ndesignation as such subjects him to various harms entitling him\n\nto relief.   We agree with the judge that the plaintiff's claim\n\nfor certiorari relief, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, § 4, does not\n\nlie because the designation was a discretionary administrative\n\ndecision rather than an adjudicatory or quasi adjudicatory one,\n\nand that his due process claim fails because his designation as\n\na member of an STG does not infringe upon a protected liberty\n\ninterest.2   We accordingly affirm the judgment of dismissal.\n\n     Background.   \"We review the allowance of a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo, accepting as true all factual allegations in\n\nthe complaint and favorable inferences drawn therefrom.

Essex County\nNewspapers, Inc., 367 Mass. 849, 853 (1975).\n\f                                                                    3\n\n\ncomplaint and items appearing in the record.    Melia v.

Plaud, 466 Mass.\n\n240, 241 (2013).\n\n     As we observed in the introduction, the plaintiff is an\n\ninmate in the custody of the Department of Correction.3    In\n\nNovember, 2014, a search of his cell uncovered pictures of a\n\nnumber of other prisoners the plaintiff had befriended, all of\n\nwhom were members of a known STG.    One week later, the\n\nfacility's inner perimeter security team informed the plaintiff\n\nthat it intended to classify him as a gang member, due to the\n\ndiscovery of pictures of gang members in his cell.\n\n     In February, 2015, the defendant investigative services\n\nchief met with the plaintiff to allow him to dispute his\n\nidentification as a member of the Latin Kings gang.   Following\n\nthe meeting (in which the plaintiff denied his membership in the\n\nLatin Kings), the investigative services chief notified the\n\nplaintiff by letter dated February 12, 2015, that his\n\nidentification as a member of an STG had been \"validated,\" and\n\nadvising him that he could appeal that decision to the\n\nCommissioner within five days of the notice.   By letter dated\n\n\n     3\n       In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was held\nat Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord. According\nto our docket and the plaintiff's brief, the plaintiff currently\nresides at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley.\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nFebruary 24, 2015, the plaintiff appealed to the Commissioner,\n\nwho rejected his appeal.4   By two subsequent letters, one from\n\nthe plaintiff on March 16, 2015, and another from an attorney on\n\nhis behalf on March 23, 2015, the plaintiff expressed his\n\ndispleasure and disagreement with his designation as an STG\n\nmember.\n\n     As a result of his designation as an STG member, the\n\nplaintiff is restricted in his employment opportunities within\n\nthe correctional facility where he is housed.   In addition, the\n\nplaintiff alleges that his false designation as an STG member\n\nsubjects him to danger from other inmates who are enemies of\n\nthat group.\n\n     In his complaint, the plaintiff asserted that his\n\ndesignation violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of\n\nRights, G. L. c. 231A, G. L. c. 30A, §§ 1-8, and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, and also asserted a claim for defamation.\n\n     Discussion.   \"A [Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754\n\n(1974),] motion may be allowed only when the complaint's factual\n\n\n     4\n       The plaintiff's verified complaint did not describe the\ngrounds for denial, and did not include a copy of the letter of\ndenial as an exhibit. We consequently are without any basis to\nascertain the reasons for the denial. We note, however, that\nthe plaintiff's letter to the Commissioner appealing his\ndesignation as an STG member is dated February 24, 2015, beyond\nthe appeal period described in the February 12, 2015, letter\nadvising him of his designation.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\nallegations (and reasonable inferences therefrom), accepted as\n\ntrue, do not plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.    See\n\nIannacchino v. Ford Motor Co., 451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008);\n\nCurtis v. Herb Chambers I-95, Inc., [supra].   'Factual\n\nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\n\nspeculative level . . . [based] on the assumption that all the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in\n\nfact).'   Iannacchino v. Ford Motor Co., supra at 636, quoting\n\nfrom Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).\n\nAssertions set out in a motion to dismiss are not part of the\n\nrule 12(b)(6) review equation.   Eigerman v. Putnam Invs., Inc.,\n\n450 Mass. 281, 285 n.6 (2007).   Romano v. Sacknoff, 4 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 862, 863 (1976).\"   Fraelick v. PerkettPR, Inc., 83 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 698, 699-700 (2013).\n\n     In his complaint and in his arguments in the Superior Court\n\nand on appeal, the plaintiff relied principally on the\n\ncertiorari statute, G. L. c. 249, § 4, for jurisdiction.5    \"In\n\n\n     5\n       Though the plaintiff's complaint alleged violations of\nG. L. c. 231A and G. L. c. 30A, §§ 1-8, he has directed no\nargument to either statute, and neither supports a cause of\naction for any violation thereof. Any claim that either statute\nfurnishes a cause of action under the plaintiff's complaint\naccordingly is waived. In any event, to the extent c. 231A\nsupports an action for a declaratory judgment on the plaintiff's\nclaim of a due process violation, it is subsumed in our\ndiscussion of that issue, infra. We also note that the sections\nof the Administrative Procedure Act applicable to the Department\nof Correction, G. L. c. 30A, §§ 1-8, see G. L. c. 30A, § 1A, do\nnot include those sections of the Act that govern procedures\n\f                                                                      6\n\n\ngeneral, a plaintiff is only entitled to certiorari review of an\n\nadministrative decision if [he] can demonstrate the presence of\n\nthree elements:   '(1) a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding,\n\n(2) from which there is no other reasonably available remedy,\n\nand (3) a substantial injury or injustice arising from the\n\nproceeding under review.'\"     Revere v. Massachusetts Gaming\n\nCommn., 476 Mass. 591, 600 (2017), quoting from Indeck v.\n\nClients' Sec. Bd., 450 Mass. 379, 385 (2008).     Inmates may bring\n\nan action in the nature of certiorari to challenge the validity\n\nof an adjudication by a disciplinary board.    See Hill v.\n\nSuperintendent, Massachusetts Correctional Inst., Walpole, 392\n\nMass. 198, 199 n.2 (1984).    The present case, however, does not\n\npertain to disciplinary board action.    While \"an action in the\n\nnature of certiorari may be brought to 'correct errors in\n\nproceedings . . . not otherwise reviewable by motion or by\n\nappeal,' that review offers no protection against discretionary\n\nadministrative actions.\"     Emerson College v. Boston, 391 Mass.\n\n415, 422 n.l4 (1984), quoting from G. L. 249, § 4, as appearing\n\nin St. 1973, c. 1114, § 289.\n\n    \"When distinguishing a quasi judicial agency proceeding\n\nfrom a legislative or purely administrative one, we have looked\n\ngenerally to the form of the proceeding and examined the extent\n\n\napplicable to adjudicatory administrative proceedings or provide\na right to judicial review of administrative decisions resulting\ntherefrom. See G. L. c. 30A, §§ 10-14.\n\f                                                                      7\n\n\nto which it resembles judicial action.\"     Revere v. Massachusetts\n\nGaming Commn., supra.   The line of demarcation between a\n\ndiscretionary administrative decision and one resulting from a\n\nquasi judicial proceeding is often less than clear.     We consider\n\nseveral factors in deciding the question:    \"(1) whether the\n\nproceeding is preceded by specific charges, see School Comm. of\n\nHudson v. Board of Educ., 448 Mass. 565, 576 (2007); (2) whether\n\nthe proceeding involves sworn testimony by witnesses subject to\n\ncross-examination, see id., or a party attesting to certain\n\nfacts, see Frawley v. Police Commr. of Cambridge, 473 Mass. 716,\n\n727 (2016), as opposed to unsworn statements by interested\n\npersons advocating for or against a proposed new policy, see\n\nSchool Comm. of Hudson, 448 Mass. at 576; (3) whether the agency\n\nconducts an investigation into the veracity of attested-to\n\nfacts, see Frawley, supra; (4) whether the proceeding culminates\n\nin an individualized determination of a party's entitlement to\n\nsome benefit, see id., or an individualized course of\n\ndiscipline, see Hoffer [v. Board of Registration in Med., 461\n\nMass. 451, 457 (2012)], as opposed to culminating in the\n\nadoption of a rule of general applicability, see Pronghorn, Inc.\n\nv. Licensing Bd. of Peabody, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 72 (1982);\n\nand (5) whether the proceeding is followed by the adoption of\n\nformal findings of fact, see School Comm. of Hudson, supra.\"\n\nId. at 600-601.\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\n     Applying those factors to the circumstances of the present\n\ncase, we observe that the \"proceeding\" in the present case was\n\nnot a proceeding at all, in the usual sense of the term; instead\n\nthe prison inner perimeter security team advised the plaintiff\n\nthat, based on information of which it had become aware, it had\n\ndetermined that he was a member of an STG.   Nor was the\n\nsubsequent one-on-one meeting with the investigative services\n\nchief a quasi adjudicatory hearing.   There were no \"charges\"\n\nbrought prior to his designation as a member of an STG, no\n\ndiscovery of information, and no witnesses presented or\n\ntestimony taken at the meeting; there was also no formal written\n\ndecision with specific findings of fact.   Nor is there any\n\nstatute or regulation requiring such an inquiry or procedure.\n\nWe conclude that the decision to designate the plaintiff a\n\nmember of an STG was a discretionary action taken pursuant to\n\nG. L. c. 124, § 1, to preserve the safety and security of staff\n\nand other inmates.6   The extraordinary difficulties inherent in\n\n\n     6\n       General Laws c. 124, § 1, as amended by St. 1972, c. 777,\n§ 5, provides in pertinent part that the Commissioner shall:\n\n     \"(a) designate, establish, maintain, and administer such\n     state correctional facilities as he deems necessary . . .\n\n     \"(b) maintain security, safety, and order at all state\n     correctional facilities, . . . take all necessary\n     precautions to prevent the occurrence or spread of any\n     disorder, riot or insurrection at any such facility, . . .\n\n     \". . .\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\nthe operation of a correctional institution warrant broad\n\ndiscretion by prison officials in the adoption of policies and\n\nthe administration of prison affairs.    See, e.g., Nelson v.\n\nCommissioner of Correction, 390 Mass. 379, 397 (1983) (transfer\n\ndecisions, either disciplinary or administrative, are within\n\nCommissioner's discretion); Real v. Superintendent, Mass.\n\nCorrectional Inst., Walpole, 390 Mass. 399, 406 (1983) (broad\n\ndiscretion necessarily given to prison officials in light of\n\ntheir extraordinarily difficult task).   Accordingly, while the\n\ndefendants' designation of the plaintiff as a member of an STG\n\nculminated in an individualized determination of the plaintiff's\n\nentitlement to certain benefits within the prison setting, they\n\ndid so within the broad discretionary purview afforded them in\n\nthe management of safety and security of the inmate population\n\ngenerally, and not as the result of an adjudicatory or quasi\n\nadjudicatory proceeding.   We conclude that certiorari is not an\n\nappropriate vehicle to seek to overturn discretionary\n\nadministrative action designed to promote legitimate penological\n\ngoals.   See Revere v. Massachusetts Gaming Commn., supra.\n\n\n\n\n    \"(q) make and promulgate necessary rules and regulations\n    incident to the exercise of his powers and the performance\n    of his duties including but not limited to rules and\n    regulations regarding . . . safety, discipline, . . .\n    classification, . . . care, and custody for all persons\n    committed to correctional facilities.\"\n\f                                                                      10\n\n\n    There likewise is no merit to the plaintiff's claim under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.    As it is undisputed that the defendants acted\n\nunder color of law, our inquiry is whether the defendants\n\ndeprived the plaintiff of \"rights, privileges, or immunities\n\nsecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"        Miga\n\nv. Holyoke, 398 Mass. 343, 349 (1986).\n\n    The gravamen of the plaintiff's § 1983 claim is that by\n\ndesignating him a member of an STG without a full and proper\n\nhearing, the defendants violated his right to due process.       It\n\nis settled that prisoners may not be deprived of life, liberty,\n\nor property without due process of law.     Wolff v. McDonnell, 418\n\nU.S. 539, 556 (1974).     A liberty interest may arise from the\n\nConstitution itself or from State-conferred privileges.\n\nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221-222 (2005).     The decision\n\nto designate the plaintiff as a member of an STG does not,\n\nhowever, implicate a liberty interest arising from the due\n\nprocess clause.     In Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 224 (1976),\n\nthe United States Supreme Court held that transferring prisoners\n\nfrom a more favorable facility to a less favorable one did not\n\ninfringe or implicate a liberty interest within the meaning of\n\nthe due process clause:    \"We reject at the outset the notion\n\nthat any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is\n\nsufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due\n\nProcess Clause . . . .     Similarly, we cannot agree that any\n\f                                                                   11\n\n\nchange in the conditions of confinement having a substantial\n\nadverse impact on the prisoner involved is sufficient to invoke\n\nthe protections of the Due Process Clause.\"   The decision to\n\nidentify the plaintiff as a member of an STG likewise does not\n\nimplicate a liberty interest created by State law.    State-\n\ncreated liberty interests generally are \"limited to freedom from\n\nrestraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an\n\nunexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due\n\nProcess Clause of its own force . . . nonetheless imposes\n\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\n\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.\"    Sandin v. Conner, 515\n\nU.S. 472, 484 (1995).   See id. at 486 (disciplining prisoner for\n\nthirty days \"in segregated confinement did not present the type\n\nof atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might\n\nconceivably create a liberty interest\").\n\n     The Supreme Judicial Court has held that Sandin forecloses\n\nan inmate's Federal due process claim based upon an\n\nadministrative order transferring certain categories of inmates,\n\nwithout a hearing, from prerelease to higher security facilities\n\nbecause such an order does not impose \"atypical and significant\n\nhardship.\"   Hastings v. Commissioner of Correction, 424 Mass.\n\n46, 51-52 (1997).7   The mere identification of the plaintiff as a\n\n\n     7\n       The inmates in Hastings claimed that their State-created\nliberty interests arose from various statutes and regulations,\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\nmember of an STG, and the concomitant loss of the right to be\n\nconsidered for certain employment opportunities within the\n\ncorrectional facility, similarly does not impose atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship on the plaintiff in relation to the\n\nordinary incidents of prison life.   Under the standards\n\nannounced in Sandin, the plaintiff's loss of the chance to\n\nparticipate in certain prison employment opportunities does not\n\naffect any State-created liberty interest and thus does not\n\nviolate the due process clause.   See Harbin-Bey v. Rutter, 420\n\nF.3d 571, 577 (6th Cir. 2005) (designation as STG member \"does\n\nnot constitute an atypical and significant hardship in relation\n\nto the ordinary incidents of prison life\").   See also Dupont v.\n\nSaunders, 800 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"prisoners have no\n\nvested property or liberty\" interest in ability to obtain or\n\nmaintain prison employment).\n\n    The plaintiff has not alleged that the defendants\n\ncommunicated his designation as an STG member to any other\n\ninmates (or that such inmates otherwise have acquired knowledge\n\n\n\nincluding G. L. c. 124, § 1 (powers of Commissioner); 103 Code\nMass. Regs. § 420 (1995) (classification regulations); and 103\nCode Mass. Regs. § 464 (1993) (work-release regulations). The\nplaintiff in the present case makes a similar argument, claiming\nthat the defendants violated State-created liberty interests\narising from G. L. c. 127, § 39 (segregated units); 103 Code\nMass. Regs. § 420 (2007) (classification regulations); 103 Code\nMass. Regs. § 421 (1994) (departmental segregation regulations);\nand 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 430 (2006) (disciplinary\nproceedings).\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\nof his designation), yet inherent in the plaintiff's assertion\n\nthat the designation subjects him to danger from other inmates\n\nis the fact that such other inmates must be aware of the\n\ndesignation.   Simply put, the plaintiff has alleged no facts to\n\nsupport his conclusory allegation that his designation as an STG\n\nmember has put him in danger.

One week later, the\n\nfacility's inner perimeter security team informed the plaintiff\n\nthat it intended to classify him as a gang member, due to the\n\ndiscovery of pictures of gang members in his cell.\n\n     In February, 2015, the defendant investigative services\n\nchief met with the plaintiff to allow him to dispute his\n\nidentification as a member of the Latin Kings gang.   Following\n\nthe meeting (in which the plaintiff denied his membership in the\n\nLatin Kings), the investigative services chief notified the\n\nplaintiff by letter dated February 12, 2015, that his\n\nidentification as a member of an STG had been \"validated,\" and\n\nadvising him that he could appeal that decision to the\n\nCommissioner within five days of the notice.   By letter dated\n\n\n     3\n       In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was held\nat Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord. According\nto our docket and the plaintiff's brief, the plaintiff currently\nresides at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley.\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nFebruary 24, 2015, the plaintiff appealed to the Commissioner,\n\nwho rejected his appeal.4   By two subsequent letters, one from\n\nthe plaintiff on March 16, 2015, and another from an attorney on\n\nhis behalf on March 23, 2015, the plaintiff expressed his\n\ndispleasure and disagreement with his designation as an STG\n\nmember.\n\n     As a result of his designation as an STG member, the\n\nplaintiff is restricted in his employment opportunities within\n\nthe correctional facility where he is housed.   In addition, the\n\nplaintiff alleges that his false designation as an STG member\n\nsubjects him to danger from other inmates who are enemies of\n\nthat group.\n\n     In his complaint, the plaintiff asserted that his\n\ndesignation violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of\n\nRights, G. L. c. 231A, G. L. c. 30A, §§ 1-8, and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, and also asserted a claim for defamation.\n\n     Discussion.   \"A [Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1974),] motion may be allowed only when the complaint's factual\n\n\n     4\n       The plaintiff's verified complaint did not describe the\ngrounds for denial, and did not include a copy of the letter of\ndenial as an exhibit.

Massachusetts\n\nGaming Commn., supra.   The line of demarcation between a\n\ndiscretionary administrative decision and one resulting from a\n\nquasi judicial proceeding is often less than clear.     We consider\n\nseveral factors in deciding the question:    \"(1) whether the\n\nproceeding is preceded by specific charges, see School Comm. of\n\nHudson v. Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (2007); (2) whether\n\nthe proceeding involves sworn testimony by witnesses subject to\n\ncross-examination, see id., or a party attesting to certain\n\nfacts, see Frawley v.

Nor was the\n\nsubsequent one-on-one meeting with the investigative services\n\nchief a quasi adjudicatory hearing.   There were no \"charges\"\n\nbrought prior to his designation as a member of an STG, no\n\ndiscovery of information, and no witnesses presented or\n\ntestimony taken at the meeting; there was also no formal written\n\ndecision with specific findings of fact.   Nor is there any\n\nstatute or regulation requiring such an inquiry or procedure.\n\nWe conclude that the decision to designate the plaintiff a\n\nmember of an STG was a discretionary action taken pursuant to\n\nG. L. c. 124, § 1, to preserve the safety and security of staff\n\nand other inmates.6   The extraordinary difficulties inherent in\n\n\n     6\n       General Laws c. 124, § 1, as amended by St. 1972, c. 777,\n§ 5, provides in pertinent part that the Commissioner shall:\n\n     \"(a) designate, establish, maintain, and administer such\n     state correctional facilities as he deems necessary . . .\n\n     \"(b) maintain security, safety, and order at all state\n     correctional facilities, . . . take all necessary\n     precautions to prevent the occurrence or spread of any\n     disorder, riot or insurrection at any such facility, . . .\n\n     \". . .\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\nthe operation of a correctional institution warrant broad\n\ndiscretion by prison officials in the adoption of policies and\n\nthe administration of prison affairs.

Accordingly, while the\n\ndefendants' designation of the plaintiff as a member of an STG\n\nculminated in an individualized determination of the plaintiff's\n\nentitlement to certain benefits within the prison setting, they\n\ndid so within the broad discretionary purview afforded them in\n\nthe management of safety and security of the inmate population\n\ngenerally, and not as the result of an adjudicatory or quasi\n\nadjudicatory proceeding.   We conclude that certiorari is not an\n\nappropriate vehicle to seek to overturn discretionary\n\nadministrative action designed to promote legitimate penological\n\ngoals.   See Revere v.

Under the standards\n\nannounced in Sandin, the plaintiff's loss of the chance to\n\nparticipate in certain prison employment opportunities does not\n\naffect any State-created liberty interest and thus does not\n\nviolate the due process clause.

L. c. 124, § 1 (powers of Commissioner); 103 Code\nMass. Regs. § 420 (1995) (classification regulations); and 103\nCode Mass. Regs. § 464 (1993) (work-release regulations). The\nplaintiff in the present case makes a similar argument, claiming\nthat the defendants violated State-created liberty interests\narising from G. L. c. 127, § 39 (segregated units); 103 Code\nMass. Regs. § 420 (2007) (classification regulations); 103 Code\nMass. Regs. § 421 (1994) (departmental segregation regulations);\nand 103 Code Mass.

Simply put, the plaintiff has alleged no facts to\n\nsupport his conclusory allegation that his designation as an STG\n\nmember has put him in danger.   Accordingly, the allegation does\n\nnot implicate a protected liberty interest.    See Iannacchino v.\n\nFord Motor Co., 451 Mass. at 636 (\"[f]actual allegations must be\n\nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\"\n\n[quotation omitted]).\n\n     Finally, the judge properly dismissed the plaintiff's claim\n\nfor defamation, if for no reason other than that, as we have\n\nobserved, see note 2, supra, the plaintiff has not alleged that\n\nthe defendants published his designation as an STG member to\n\n\"any considerable and respectable segment in the community.\"\n\nStone v.
