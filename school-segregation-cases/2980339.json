Ross McKnight, Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc.\r\n(Throckmorton), Olney Bancshares of Texas, Inc. (Olney), and the remaining\r\nappellees listed above.  Lindley contends that the trial court erred by denying\r\nher motion for summary judgment, granting appellees’ motions for summary\r\njudgment, making allegedly incorrect rulings on the parties’ objections to\r\nsummary judgment evidence, and awarding more than $200,000 in attorney’s fees\r\nto appellees.  We affirm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background Facts</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Throckmorton and Olney are holding companies\r\nthat </span>purchase and own affiliated or unaffiliated banks.  McKnight is the\r\nchairman of the board and president of Throckmorton, and he is the president of\r\nOlney.  He owns stock in both corporations.  <span>Daws\r\nwas one of the initial shareholders of Olney (investing $25,000), which was\r\nformed to acquire the First National Bank of Olney and later acquired seven\r\nother banks.  She also owned significant stock in Throckmorton, which owns only\r\nthe First National Bank of Throckmorton.  Lindley is Daws’s niece.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          McKnight and Daws are distant relatives.  Daws’s\r\nhusband, Jim Bob, was once the chairman of the First National Bank of\r\nThrockmorton.  McKnight has lived in the city of Throckmorton his entire life\r\nexcept when he attended college.  He was raised next door to the Dawses and\r\nlived close to them until he went to college.  He considered them to be friends.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          In 1996, Throckmorton and Olney considered\r\nconversions to S corporations.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span> \r\nIn November of that year, McKnight sent a letter to Olney’s shareholders\r\nstating that to complete the conversion, they needed to all agree to it through\r\nan IRS election form and a shareholders’ agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The Throckmorton shareholders’ agreement,\r\nwhich was revised and approved by the corporation’s attorney, Richard Dale\r\nCraig, contains the following provisions, among others:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>SHAREHOLDERS\r\nAGREEMENT</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          THIS AGREEMENT made effective\r\nthe 1st day of January, 1997, by and among Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc., a\r\nTexas corporation (the “Corporation”) and the undersigned shareholders of the\r\nCorporation and their respective spouses (the “Original Shareholders”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          WHEREAS, the Corporation intends\r\nto file an election to be taxed as an S corporation under the Internal Revenue\r\nCode of 1986, as amended with the consent of the Original Shareholders; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          WHEREAS, the Original Shareholders,\r\nacting for themselves and for all persons who subsequently may become\r\nshareholders of the Corporation (the “Shareholders”), and the Corporation wish\r\nto keep the election in force until it is revoked pursuant to this Agreement. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          NOW, THEREFORE, the Original\r\nShareholders and the Corporation agree as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 1.  <u>Voluntary\r\nTransfer of Stock</u>.  No Shareholder shall transfer stock of the Corporation\r\nby sale, gift, assignment, pledge, or other voluntary disposition or\r\nencumbrance unless he shall have provided the Corporation, at least thirty (30)\r\ndays prior to the proposed transfer, with a written statement (the “Notice”)\r\nregarding the identity of the proposed transferee sufficient to satisfy the\r\nCorporation that (a) the proposed transferee is an eligible S corporation\r\nshareholder and (b) the proposed transfer will not cause the record number of\r\nShareholders of the Corporation to exceed thirty-two (32).  Such proposed\r\ntransfer may be effected by the Shareholder only if the Corporation approves\r\nthe transfer in accordance with Section 3 below.  Any transfer of stock of the\r\nCorporation that is not described in this Section 1 as a voluntary transfer\r\nshall be considered an involuntary transfer subject to the provisions of\r\nSection 2 below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 2.  <u>Involuntary\r\nTransfer of Stock</u>.   In the event any Shareholder:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          (a) dies;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and, as a result of such event, the stock\r\nof the Corporation owned by that Shareholder is subject to being transferred, .\r\n. . the Shareholder shall be deemed, when the identity of the proposed\r\ntransferee is established, to have given Notice, as defined under Section 1\r\nhereof, except that the Corporation shall not be deemed to have received such\r\nNotice until the Corporation has actual knowledge of the event and the identity\r\nof the proposed transferee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 3.  <u>Approval by the\r\nCorporation</u>.  Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of a Notice required\r\nby Section 1 hereof, the Corporation shall advise the Shareholder who provided\r\nthe Notice whether the Corporation approves the transfer.  The Corporation may,\r\nin its sole discretion, approve or disapprove any proposed transfer, except\r\nthat the Corporation shall withhold its approval of any proposed transfer if\r\n(a) it would cause or reasonably could cause the Corporation’s S status to\r\nterminate or (b) it would cause the record number of Shareholders of the\r\nCorporation to exceed thirty-two (32).[<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 4.  <u>Effect of\r\nNoncompliance</u>.  In the event of any purported or attempted transfer of\r\nstock that does not comply with the provisions of this agreement, the purported\r\ntransfer shall be void and the purported transferee shall not be deemed to be a\r\nShareholder of the Corporation and shall not be entitled to receive a new stock\r\ncertificate or any dividends or other distributions on or with respect to the\r\nstock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 5.  <u>Redemption of\r\nShares</u>.  If a Shareholder attempts to transfer stock of the Corporation in\r\na manner that does not comply with the provisions of this Agreement, the shares\r\npurported to be transferred shall, at the Corporation’s option, be deemed to be\r\nredeemed immediately before the occurrence of the attempted transfer.  If the\r\nCorporation exercises its option to redeem shares, the amount to be paid\r\ntherefor shall be their book value . . . as of the end of the fiscal year\r\nimmediately preceding the redemption . . . , which amount shall be payable in\r\ncash.[<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Daws signed both corporations’ shareholders’\r\nagreements.  McKnight asserted through an affidavit that the goals of the transfer\r\nrestrictions were to protect the corporations’ anticipated Subchapter S status,\r\nminimize franchise taxes, promote ownership by shareholders who contributed to\r\nthe success of the banks owned by the corporations “in some way other than\r\nindirect ownership,” and comply with various “federal and state banking\r\nrequirements, which may from time to time affect bank ownership.”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          All of the corporations’ shareholders had to\r\nconsent to Subchapter S status for the conversions to occur.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span> \r\nCraig explained that new legislation had been passed that permitted financial\r\ninstitutions to become S corporations effective in 1997.  He also said that a\r\ncorporation could not qualify for Subchapter S status if it had more than\r\nseventy-five shareholders.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span> \r\nCraig conceded that federal law does not require S corporations to have\r\nshareholders’ agreements.  He explained, however, that such agreements are\r\nhelpful to protect Subchapter S status because the agreements may prevent\r\nshareholders from exceeding seventy-five or from transferring stock to an\r\nimpermissible shareholder, such as another corporation.  Craig said,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          It’s extremely easy to have an\r\ninadvertent termination of an S election.  And one of the reasons that you\r\nhave a shareholders[’] agreement is to help put you in the best position to\r\nargue with the IRS that there wasn’t an impermissible transfer, that there are\r\ncontractual restrictions that prevent that. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . .  [I]t’s never a position\r\nthat one wants to be in to ask for forgiveness from the IRS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Daws died on June 25, 2000 (years after\r\nsigning the shareholders’ agreements), at which time she owned over 25% of the\r\nshares of Throckmorton’s stock, making her the corporation’s largest shareholder. \r\nShe was a minority shareholder in Olney.  She also had a checking account with\r\nthe First National Bank of Throckmorton that contained approximately $100,000. \r\nDaws’s will named Lindley as independent executor and bequeathed all of the\r\nresiduary estate (including almost all of the stock) to her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          In August 2000, Lindley was officially appointed\r\nas the independent executor of Daws’s estate, and a Wichita County court\r\nadmitted Daws’s will to probate.  During meetings occurring that same month, McKnight\r\nadvised the corporations’ boards of directors that the corporations had received\r\na copy of Daws’s will on July 26, 2000.  The minutes of the Throckmorton\r\nmeeting state that McKnight noted that “under the terms of the Shareholders[’]\r\nAgreement, Mrs. Daws’[s] death constituted an ‘involuntary transfer’ of her\r\nstock in the Corporation,” and the company had the “sole discretion to approve\r\nor disapprove” the attempted transfer.  The minutes then explain that the\r\ndirectors recognized </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">the benefit to the Corporation and its\r\nsubsidiary bank of having local ownership and the support which the local shareholders\r\ngave to the bank.  It was further noted that while the number of the\r\nCorporation’s shareholders was less than the maximum permitted under the\r\nCorporation’s Bylaws, it was still desirable not to increase the number of\r\nshareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . .  It was . . . recommended\r\nthat the Board of Directors disapprove the transfer to [Lindley], and that the\r\nstock be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders[’]\r\nAgreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Thus, the Throckmorton board disapproved the\r\ntransfer of ninety-two shares of stock to Lindley and voted that those shares\r\nbe redeemed through a payment of the book value of the stock as of December 31,\r\n1999.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[7]</span></span></span> \r\nThe Olney board took a similar action as reflected in minutes from its August\r\n2000 meeting; the minutes state that corporation redeemed 625 shares of Olney\r\nstock that Daws attempted to transfer to Lindley.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          On August 11, 2000, Bruce Crum, an attorney\r\nfor the corporations, sent a letter to Lindley informing her of the disapproved\r\ntransfer and redemption of the shares.  Crum expressed that he included copies\r\nof audited financial statements for the corporations and that he also sent the\r\nletter to Daws’s estate’s counsel.  Ten days later, Crum sent a letter to the\r\nestate’s counsel that enclosed the corporations’ bylaws and the minutes of the\r\nmeetings that had occurred that month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Lindley sued McKnight, Throckmorton, Olney,\r\nand Throckmorton’s and Olney’s shareholders.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[8]</span></span></span> \r\nLindley asserted that appellees had implemented unenforceable shareholders’\r\nagreements.  She sought declarations, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\r\nAct (UDJA),<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[9]</span></span></span>\r\nthat the agreements were unreasonable and void and that appellees had failed to\r\ncomply with them.  She also alleged that McKnight had breached a fiduciary duty\r\nto Daws by failing to disclose the legal effect of the agreements upon her\r\nestate, that appellees were liable for common law fraud and statutory fraud\r\nbased on alleged misrepresentations about the necessity and legal effect of the\r\nagreements, and that appellees breached section three of the agreements by\r\nfailing to reject the stock transfers to her within twenty days of receiving\r\nknowledge that she was the proposed transferee.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[10]</span></span></span> \r\nLindley sought compensatory damages for the difference between the book value\r\nand fair market value of Daws’s stock and for dividends and distributions on the\r\nstock to which she claimed to be entitled.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[11]</span></span></span> \r\nShe also asked for exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellees filed answers that included\r\ngeneral denials<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[12]</span></span></span>\r\nand defenses. Appellees sought declaratory relief about the validity of the\r\nshareholders’ agreements, asserting that they were reasonably drafted to keep\r\nlocal ownership and ensure the viability of independent community banks.  Appellees\r\nalso asked the trial court to award attorney’s fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Approximately five years after filing the\r\nsuit, Lindley filed a motion for partial summary judgment on her claim that the\r\nagreements were void as a matter of law because they unreasonably restricted\r\nthe transfer of stock.  Appellees responded to Lindley’s motion and filed a no-evidence\r\nmotion for summary judgment on Lindley’s claims.  Appellees also filed a\r\ntraditional motion for partial summary judgment on their affirmative defenses. \r\nLindley responded to both of appellees’ motions.  With leave of court, appellees\r\nfiled supplements to their traditional motion for summary judgment; the\r\nsupplements contended, among other arguments, that Lindley was estopped from\r\nchallenging the shareholders’ agreements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The trial court denied Lindley’s motion for\r\npartial summary judgment and granted appellees’ motions for summary judgment.  Lindley\r\nbrought this appeal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Summary Judgment Standards</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          We review a summary judgment de novo.  <i>Travelers\r\nIns. Co. v. Joachim</i>, 315 S.W.3d 860, 862 (Tex. 2010).  We consider the\r\nevidence presented in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting\r\nevidence favorable to the nonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and\r\ndisregarding evidence contrary to the nonmovant unless reasonable jurors could\r\nnot.  <i>Mann Frankfort Stein &amp; Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding</i>, 289\r\nS.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009).  We indulge every reasonable inference and resolve\r\nany doubts in the nonmovant’s favor.  <i>20801, Inc. v. Parker</i>, 249 S.W.3d\r\n392, 399 (Tex. 2008).  We must consider whether reasonable and fair-minded\r\njurors could differ in their conclusions in light of all of the evidence\r\npresented.  <i>See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

shareholders’ agreements or the actions\r\nthat the corporations took under the agreements.  But Daws’s estate accepted\r\nbenefits that it could not have received if the agreements are not valid and\r\nwere not complied with.  On October 11, 2000, the corporations sent letters to\r\nLindley to explain that under provisions of the shareholders’ agreements that\r\nwere detailed in the letters, they had rejected Daws’s stock transfer to her\r\nand had redeemed Daws’s shares.  The corporations informed Lindley that\r\nthey were paying her $358.03 per share for Daws’s 625 shares of Olney stock and\r\n$5,543.89 per share for Daws’s ninety-two shares of Throckmorton stock that the\r\ncorporations redeemed.   </span>Both letters stated, “At the request of\r\nthe Estate’s counsel, . . . we have delayed in remitting to the Estate proceeds\r\nof the [stock] sale.  However, we do not believe we should continue to delay in\r\nmaking payment.”  The record contains copies of checks (of $510,037.88 for the\r\nThrockmorton shares and $223,768.75 for the Olney shares) sent by the\r\ncorporations to Daws’s estate and negotiated by Lindley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          During\r\noral argument, Lindley’s counsel conceded, “The banks perfectly complied with\r\ntheir obligations under the shareholders’ agreements when they tendered these\r\nchecks.”  It is undisputed that Lindley knew (by way of the letters) that the\r\ncorporations had disapproved of the transfers to her when she negotiated the\r\nchecks and that the checks were being issued for the redemption of the shares. \r\nThe <i>only reason</i> that Daws’s estate could have been entitled to receive specific\r\npayments totaling $733,806.63 is the redemption of the stock under section five\r\nof the shareholders’ agreements.  When Lindley negotiated the checks, she obviously\r\nknew of her claims that Key had read Daws’s will and that the corporations had\r\ntherefore allegedly received notice of Daws’s intended transfer to her because\r\nKey allegedly read Daws’s will months before the checks were negotiated.  Throughout\r\nthe course of this litigation, which began in 2000, Lindley never returned the\r\nmoney that the corporations tendered to Daws’s estate.  We conclude that it\r\nwould be unconscionable to allow Daws’s estate to retain the benefit it\r\nreceived for the redemption of Daws’s shares while it concurrently challenges\r\nthe provisions of the shareholders’ agreements that made the redemption\r\npossible.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[21]</span></span></span><i><span>  See Clark</span></i><span>,\r\n327 S.W.3d at 770.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Citing <i>Lopez</i>, Lindley argues that the\r\n“Estate’s initial acceptance of lesser payments in October 2000 . . . is <u>not</u>\r\ninconsistent with the Estate’s subsequent assertion that it was entitled to\r\nmore.”  <i>See</i> 22 S.W.3d at 864.  In <i>Lopez</i>, a contingent fee\r\ncontract allowed a law firm to collect 45% of the recovery if the case was\r\nappealed to a higher court rather than 40% if it was not.  <i>Id.</i> at 859. \r\nThe law firm charged the Lopezes the additional 5% when the defendant initiated\r\nthe appeal even though the case was settled shortly afterward.  <i>Id.</i>  Three\r\nyears after the Lopezes received a distribution for 55% of the settlement, it sued\r\nthe firm, and the firm asserted that “acceptance of benefits” precluded the Lopezes’\r\nfraud, negligence, and deceptive trade practices claims.  <i>Id.</i> at 860,\r\n863.  In that context, the supreme court held that “the Lopezes’ initial\r\nacceptance of a lesser portion of the settlement is not inconsistent with their\r\nlater assertion that they were entitled to more.”  <i>Id.</i> at 864.  Thus,\r\nthe supreme court concluded that by accepting 55% of the settlement, which the\r\nLopezes were undisputedly entitled to under any scenario, they were not\r\nprecluded from contending that they were entitled to 5% more under the same\r\nprovision of the contingent fee contract.  <i>See id.</i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>          </span></i><span>Here,\r\nhowever, Daws’s estate could not be entitled to <i>any</i> money under section\r\nfive of the shareholders’ agreement unless her shares were properly redeemed. \r\nAnd the shares could not have been properly redeemed if there is merit to\r\neither of Lindley’s breach of contract or UDJA claims, which asked the trial\r\ncourt to either invalidate the transfer restrictions in the shareholders’\r\nagreements or find that the corporations violated them.  Thus, unlike in <i>Lopez</i>,\r\nLindley’s claim to be entitled to more money in this case is not based on the\r\nsame part of the contract to which Daws’s estate already received money; the\r\nclaim is instead premised on challenging the very mechanism from which the </span>$733,806.63\r\n<span>was paid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>           We recognize that there can be no estoppel\r\nfrom acceptance of benefits by a person who did not have knowledge of all\r\nmaterial facts.  <i>Frazier v. Wynn</i>, 472 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1971); <i>Clark</i>,\r\n327 S.W.3d at 770.  Lindley contends that she did not learn about the\r\n“misrepresentations regarding the consent transfer restrictions until the bank\r\nboards of directors refused to consent to the transfer of [Daws’s] stock.”  But\r\nDaws’s estate was the real plaintiff in the trial court, not Lindley.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[22]</span></span></span> \r\nThe summary judgment evidence shows that Daws knew of the transfer restrictions\r\nbefore her death.  During McKnight’s deposition, he said that before the\r\ncorporations received Subchapter S status, he talked to Daws for about half an\r\nhour about the possible conversions, told her that there would be limitations\r\non who could own stock once the conversions occurred, and informed her that the\r\nboards of directors would have the authority to disapprove “any transfer of\r\nstock.”  Furthermore, according to McKnight’s affidavit, the restrictions imposed\r\nby the shareholders’ agreements were “conspicuously noted on all of the share\r\ncertificates of Olney and Throckmorton, including those issued to Nan Daws.”  Finally,\r\nand most obviously, Daws signed the shareholders’ agreements that contained the\r\nrestrictions.  We must generally charge a party with knowledge of the contents\r\nof a document that the party signed.  <i>See EZ Pawn Corp. v. Mancias</i>, 934\r\nS.W.2d 87, 90 (Tex. 1996).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          More importantly, even if there was some\r\npoint in the past when Daws did not know of the transfer restrictions and the\r\ncorporations’ potential to refuse her intended devise of shares to Lindley,\r\nDaws’s estate, through Lindley, accepted the benefit in question (</span>$733,806.63)\r\nat a time that it knew all facts regarding the distribution of that benefit and\r\nthe actual rejection of the transfer, as is evidenced by the corporations’\r\nletters sent to Lindley in August and October 2000.  <i>Cf.

Ross McKnight, Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc.\r\n(Throckmorton), Olney Bancshares of Texas, Inc. (Olney), and the remaining\r\nappellees listed above.  Lindley contends that the trial court erred by denying\r\nher motion for summary judgment, granting appellees’ motions for summary\r\njudgment, making allegedly incorrect rulings on the parties’ objections to\r\nsummary judgment evidence, and awarding more than $200,000 in attorney’s fees\r\nto appellees.  We affirm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background Facts</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Throckmorton and Olney are holding companies\r\nthat </span>purchase and own affiliated or unaffiliated banks.  McKnight is the\r\nchairman of the board and president of Throckmorton, and he is the president of\r\nOlney.  He owns stock in both corporations.  <span>Daws\r\nwas one of the initial shareholders of Olney (investing $25,000), which was\r\nformed to acquire the First National Bank of Olney and later acquired seven\r\nother banks.  She also owned significant stock in Throckmorton, which owns only\r\nthe First National Bank of Throckmorton.  Lindley is Daws’s niece.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          McKnight and Daws are distant relatives.  Daws’s\r\nhusband, Jim Bob, was once the chairman of the First National Bank of\r\nThrockmorton.  McKnight has lived in the city of Throckmorton his entire life\r\nexcept when he attended college.  He was raised next door to the Dawses and\r\nlived close to them until he went to college.  He considered them to be friends.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          In 1996, Throckmorton and Olney considered\r\nconversions to S corporations.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span> \r\nIn November of that year, McKnight sent a letter to Olney’s shareholders\r\nstating that to complete the conversion, they needed to all agree to it through\r\nan IRS election form and a shareholders’ agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The Throckmorton shareholders’ agreement,\r\nwhich was revised and approved by the corporation’s attorney, Richard Dale\r\nCraig, contains the following provisions, among others:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>SHAREHOLDERS\r\nAGREEMENT</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          THIS AGREEMENT made effective\r\nthe 1st day of January, 1997, by and among Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc., a\r\nTexas corporation (the “Corporation”) and the undersigned shareholders of the\r\nCorporation and their respective spouses (the “Original Shareholders”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          WHEREAS, the Corporation intends\r\nto file an election to be taxed as an S corporation under the Internal Revenue\r\nCode of 1986, as amended with the consent of the Original Shareholders; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          WHEREAS, the Original Shareholders,\r\nacting for themselves and for all persons who subsequently may become\r\nshareholders of the Corporation (the “Shareholders”), and the Corporation wish\r\nto keep the election in force until it is revoked pursuant to this Agreement. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          NOW, THEREFORE, the Original\r\nShareholders and the Corporation agree as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 1.  <u>Voluntary\r\nTransfer of Stock</u>.  No Shareholder shall transfer stock of the Corporation\r\nby sale, gift, assignment, pledge, or other voluntary disposition or\r\nencumbrance unless he shall have provided the Corporation, at least thirty (30)\r\ndays prior to the proposed transfer, with a written statement (the “Notice”)\r\nregarding the identity of the proposed transferee sufficient to satisfy the\r\nCorporation that (a) the proposed transferee is an eligible S corporation\r\nshareholder and (b) the proposed transfer will not cause the record number of\r\nShareholders of the Corporation to exceed thirty-two (32).  Such proposed\r\ntransfer may be effected by the Shareholder only if the Corporation approves\r\nthe transfer in accordance with Section 3 below.  Any transfer of stock of the\r\nCorporation that is not described in this Section 1 as a voluntary transfer\r\nshall be considered an involuntary transfer subject to the provisions of\r\nSection 2 below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 2.  <u>Involuntary\r\nTransfer of Stock</u>.   In the event any Shareholder:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          (a) dies;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and, as a result of such event, the stock\r\nof the Corporation owned by that Shareholder is subject to being transferred, .\r\n. . the Shareholder shall be deemed, when the identity of the proposed\r\ntransferee is established, to have given Notice, as defined under Section 1\r\nhereof, except that the Corporation shall not be deemed to have received such\r\nNotice until the Corporation has actual knowledge of the event and the identity\r\nof the proposed transferee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 3.  <u>Approval by the\r\nCorporation</u>.  Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of a Notice required\r\nby Section 1 hereof, the Corporation shall advise the Shareholder who provided\r\nthe Notice whether the Corporation approves the transfer.  The Corporation may,\r\nin its sole discretion, approve or disapprove any proposed transfer, except\r\nthat the Corporation shall withhold its approval of any proposed transfer if\r\n(a) it would cause or reasonably could cause the Corporation’s S status to\r\nterminate or (b) it would cause the record number of Shareholders of the\r\nCorporation to exceed thirty-two (32).[<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 4.  <u>Effect of\r\nNoncompliance</u>.  In the event of any purported or attempted transfer of\r\nstock that does not comply with the provisions of this agreement, the purported\r\ntransfer shall be void and the purported transferee shall not be deemed to be a\r\nShareholder of the Corporation and shall not be entitled to receive a new stock\r\ncertificate or any dividends or other distributions on or with respect to the\r\nstock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          Section 5.  <u>Redemption of\r\nShares</u>.  If a Shareholder attempts to transfer stock of the Corporation in\r\na manner that does not comply with the provisions of this Agreement, the shares\r\npurported to be transferred shall, at the Corporation’s option, be deemed to be\r\nredeemed immediately before the occurrence of the attempted transfer.  If the\r\nCorporation exercises its option to redeem shares, the amount to be paid\r\ntherefor shall be their book value . . . as of the end of the fiscal year\r\nimmediately preceding the redemption . . . , which amount shall be payable in\r\ncash.[<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Daws signed both corporations’ shareholders’\r\nagreements.  McKnight asserted through an affidavit that the goals of the transfer\r\nrestrictions were to protect the corporations’ anticipated Subchapter S status,\r\nminimize franchise taxes, promote ownership by shareholders who contributed to\r\nthe success of the banks owned by the corporations “in some way other than\r\nindirect ownership,” and comply with various “federal and state banking\r\nrequirements, which may from time to time affect bank ownership.”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          All of the corporations’ shareholders had to\r\nconsent to Subchapter S status for the conversions to occur.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span> \r\nCraig explained that new legislation had been passed that permitted financial\r\ninstitutions to become S corporations effective in 1997.  He also said that a\r\ncorporation could not qualify for Subchapter S status if it had more than\r\nseventy-five shareholders.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span> \r\nCraig conceded that federal law does not require S corporations to have\r\nshareholders’ agreements.  He explained, however, that such agreements are\r\nhelpful to protect Subchapter S status because the agreements may prevent\r\nshareholders from exceeding seventy-five or from transferring stock to an\r\nimpermissible shareholder, such as another corporation.  Craig said,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          It’s extremely easy to have an\r\ninadvertent termination of an S election.  And one of the reasons that you\r\nhave a shareholders[’] agreement is to help put you in the best position to\r\nargue with the IRS that there wasn’t an impermissible transfer, that there are\r\ncontractual restrictions that prevent that. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . .  [I]t’s never a position\r\nthat one wants to be in to ask for forgiveness from the IRS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Daws died on June 25, 2000 (years after\r\nsigning the shareholders’ agreements), at which time she owned over 25% of the\r\nshares of Throckmorton’s stock, making her the corporation’s largest shareholder. \r\nShe was a minority shareholder in Olney.  She also had a checking account with\r\nthe First National Bank of Throckmorton that contained approximately $100,000. \r\nDaws’s will named Lindley as independent executor and bequeathed all of the\r\nresiduary estate (including almost all of the stock) to her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          In August 2000, Lindley was officially appointed\r\nas the independent executor of Daws’s estate, and a Wichita County court\r\nadmitted Daws’s will to probate.  During meetings occurring that same month, McKnight\r\nadvised the corporations’ boards of directors that the corporations had received\r\na copy of Daws’s will on July 26, 2000.  The minutes of the Throckmorton\r\nmeeting state that McKnight noted that “under the terms of the Shareholders[’]\r\nAgreement, Mrs. Daws’[s] death constituted an ‘involuntary transfer’ of her\r\nstock in the Corporation,” and the company had the “sole discretion to approve\r\nor disapprove” the attempted transfer.  The minutes then explain that the\r\ndirectors recognized </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">the benefit to the Corporation and its\r\nsubsidiary bank of having local ownership and the support which the local shareholders\r\ngave to the bank.  It was further noted that while the number of the\r\nCorporation’s shareholders was less than the maximum permitted under the\r\nCorporation’s Bylaws, it was still desirable not to increase the number of\r\nshareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          . . .  It was . . . recommended\r\nthat the Board of Directors disapprove the transfer to [Lindley], and that the\r\nstock be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders[’]\r\nAgreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Thus, the Throckmorton board disapproved the\r\ntransfer of ninety-two shares of stock to Lindley and voted that those shares\r\nbe redeemed through a payment of the book value of the stock as of December 31,\r\n1999.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[7]</span></span></span> \r\nThe Olney board took a similar action as reflected in minutes from its August\r\n2000 meeting; the minutes state that corporation redeemed 625 shares of Olney\r\nstock that Daws attempted to transfer to Lindley.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          On August 11, 2000, Bruce Crum, an attorney\r\nfor the corporations, sent a letter to Lindley informing her of the disapproved\r\ntransfer and redemption of the shares.  Crum expressed that he included copies\r\nof audited financial statements for the corporations and that he also sent the\r\nletter to Daws’s estate’s counsel.  Ten days later, Crum sent a letter to the\r\nestate’s counsel that enclosed the corporations’ bylaws and the minutes of the\r\nmeetings that had occurred that month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Lindley sued McKnight, Throckmorton, Olney,\r\nand Throckmorton’s and Olney’s shareholders.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[8]</span></span></span> \r\nLindley asserted that appellees had implemented unenforceable shareholders’\r\nagreements.  She sought declarations, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\r\nAct (UDJA),<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[9]</span></span></span>\r\nthat the agreements were unreasonable and void and that appellees had failed to\r\ncomply with them.  She also alleged that McKnight had breached a fiduciary duty\r\nto Daws by failing to disclose the legal effect of the agreements upon her\r\nestate, that appellees were liable for common law fraud and statutory fraud\r\nbased on alleged misrepresentations about the necessity and legal effect of the\r\nagreements, and that appellees breached section three of the agreements by\r\nfailing to reject the stock transfers to her within twenty days of receiving\r\nknowledge that she was the proposed transferee.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[10]</span></span></span> \r\nLindley sought compensatory damages for the difference between the book value\r\nand fair market value of Daws’s stock and for dividends and distributions on the\r\nstock to which she claimed to be entitled.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[11]</span></span></span> \r\nShe also asked for exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellees filed answers that included\r\ngeneral denials<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[12]</span></span></span>\r\nand defenses. Appellees sought declaratory relief about the validity of the\r\nshareholders’ agreements, asserting that they were reasonably drafted to keep\r\nlocal ownership and ensure the viability of independent community banks.  Appellees\r\nalso asked the trial court to award attorney’s fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Approximately five years after filing the\r\nsuit, Lindley filed a motion for partial summary judgment on her claim that the\r\nagreements were void as a matter of law because they unreasonably restricted\r\nthe transfer of stock.  Appellees responded to Lindley’s motion and filed a no-evidence\r\nmotion for summary judgment on Lindley’s claims.  Appellees also filed a\r\ntraditional motion for partial summary judgment on their affirmative defenses. \r\nLindley responded to both of appellees’ motions.  With leave of court, appellees\r\nfiled supplements to their traditional motion for summary judgment; the\r\nsupplements contended, among other arguments, that Lindley was estopped from\r\nchallenging the shareholders’ agreements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The trial court denied Lindley’s motion for\r\npartial summary judgment and granted appellees’ motions for summary judgment.  Lindley\r\nbrought this appeal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Summary Judgment Standards</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          We review a summary judgment de novo.  <i>Travelers\r\nIns.

shareholders’ agreements or the actions\r\nthat the corporations took under the agreements.  But Daws’s estate accepted\r\nbenefits that it could not have received if the agreements are not valid and\r\nwere not complied with.  On October 11, 2000, the corporations sent letters to\r\nLindley to explain that under provisions of the shareholders’ agreements that\r\nwere detailed in the letters, they had rejected Daws’s stock transfer to her\r\nand had redeemed Daws’s shares.  The corporations informed Lindley that\r\nthey were paying her $358.03 per share for Daws’s 625 shares of Olney stock and\r\n$5,543.89 per share for Daws’s ninety-two shares of Throckmorton stock that the\r\ncorporations redeemed.   </span>Both letters stated, “At the request of\r\nthe Estate’s counsel, . . . we have delayed in remitting to the Estate proceeds\r\nof the [stock] sale.  However, we do not believe we should continue to delay in\r\nmaking payment.”  The record contains copies of checks (of $510,037.88 for the\r\nThrockmorton shares and $223,768.75 for the Olney shares) sent by the\r\ncorporations to Daws’s estate and negotiated by Lindley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">          During\r\noral argument, Lindley’s counsel conceded, “The banks perfectly complied with\r\ntheir obligations under the shareholders’ agreements when they tendered these\r\nchecks.”  It is undisputed that Lindley knew (by way of the letters) that the\r\ncorporations had disapproved of the transfers to her when she negotiated the\r\nchecks and that the checks were being issued for the redemption of the shares. \r\nThe <i>only reason</i> that Daws’s estate could have been entitled to receive specific\r\npayments totaling $733,806.63 is the redemption of the stock under section five\r\nof the shareholders’ agreements.  When Lindley negotiated the checks, she obviously\r\nknew of her claims that Key had read Daws’s will and that the corporations had\r\ntherefore allegedly received notice of Daws’s intended transfer to her because\r\nKey allegedly read Daws’s will months before the checks were negotiated.  Throughout\r\nthe course of this litigation, which began in 2000, Lindley never returned the\r\nmoney that the corporations tendered to Daws’s estate.  We conclude that it\r\nwould be unconscionable to allow Daws’s estate to retain the benefit it\r\nreceived for the redemption of Daws’s shares while it concurrently challenges\r\nthe provisions of the shareholders’ agreements that made the redemption\r\npossible.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span

Lindley argues that the\r\n“Estate’s initial acceptance of lesser payments in October 2000 . . . is <u>not</u>\r\ninconsistent with the Estate’s subsequent assertion that it was entitled to\r\nmore.”  <i>See</i> 22 S.W.3d at 864.  In <i>Lopez</i>, a contingent fee\r\ncontract allowed a law firm to collect 45% of the recovery if the case was\r\nappealed to a higher court rather than 40% if it was not.  <i>Id.</i> at 859. \r\nThe law firm charged the Lopezes the additional 5% when the defendant initiated\r\nthe appeal even though the case was settled shortly afterward.  <i>Id.</i>  Three\r\nyears after the Lopezes received a distribution for 55% of the settlement, it sued\r\nthe firm, and the firm asserted that “acceptance of benefits” precluded the Lopezes’\r\nfraud, negligence, and deceptive trade practices claims.  <i>Id.</i> at 860,\r\n863.  In that context, the supreme court held that “the Lopezes’ initial\r\nacceptance of a lesser portion of the settlement is not inconsistent with their\r\nlater assertion that they were entitled to more.”  <i>Id.</i> at 864.  Thus,\r\nthe supreme court concluded that by accepting 55% of the settlement, which the\r\nLopezes were undisputedly entitled to under any scenario, they were not\r\nprecluded from contending that they were entitled to 5% more under the same\r\nprovision of the contingent fee contract.  <i>See id.</i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>          </span></i><span>Here,\r\nhowever, Daws’s estate could not be entitled to <i>any</i> money under section\r\nfive of the shareholders’ agreement unless her shares were properly redeemed. \r\nAnd the shares could not have been properly redeemed if there is merit to\r\neither of Lindley’s breach of contract or UDJA
