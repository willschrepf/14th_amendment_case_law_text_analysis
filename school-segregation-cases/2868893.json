The\nspecific question before us is whether the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C.S 1400 et\nseq., requires a Pennsylvania school district to provide a\nstudent with disabilities who relocates from another state\nwith an interim educational program identical to the\nprogram the student received in his or her prior state of\nresidence. Michael C., a student with disabilities, attended\na private school in Washington, D.C. under an\nIndividualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") formulated by\nWashington educational authorities. Michael and his father\nmoved from Washington to Radnor Township, Pennsylvania\nin the summer of 1997, and requested special educational\ntreatment from the Radnor Township School District\n(\"Radnor\"). Radnor responded with specific educational\nproposals but Michael's father rejected them, and\n\n                                  2\n\funilaterally placed Michael in a private school. Michael\nremained in this school for 41 days, after which his family\nagain moved, this time to New Jersey.\n\nMichael's father later initiated administrative proceedings\nseeking reimbursement for tuition costs incurred while\nMichael attended the private school in Pennsylvania. After\nunsuccessfully pursuing his administrative remedies,\nMichael's father filed this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nagainst Radnor and the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation (\"PDE\"), seeking tuition reimbursement and\nclaiming violations of the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. S 1415(j), the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. S 794, and the Civil Rights Act\nof 1871, 42 U.S.C. S 1983. He also claimed that Michael's\nand his family's right to travel interstate under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nhad been violated. On cross-motions for summary\njudgment, the district court entered summary judgment in\nfavor of Radnor and PDE as to all claims. The court also\ngranted PDE's separate motion for dismissal of theS 1983\nclaim as to it based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nThis timely appeal followed.1 We will affirm.\n\nI.\n\nThe facts of this case are undisputed. Michael, 17 years\nold at the time events relevant to this case occurred, is\nlearning disabled and suffers from severe hemophilia. Prior\nto August 1997, Michael and his father lived in Washington\nD.C. Pursuant to the IDEA, Washington public educational\nauthorities had developed an IEP2 for Michael.3 This IEP\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 20 U.S.C. S 1415(i) (formerly 20 U.S.C. S 1415(e)) and 28\nU.S.C. SS 1331 and 1343. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. S 1291.\n\n2. The IEP is the \"centerpiece\" of the IDEA. See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S.\n305, 311 (1988). \" `The IEP consists of a detailed written statement\narrived at by a multi-disciplinary team summarizing the child's abilities,\noutlining the goals for the child's education and specifying the services\nthe child will receive.' \" Oberti v. Board of Educ. of Borough of\nClementon\nSch. Dist., 995 F.2d 1204, 1213 n.16 (3d Cir. 1993) (quoting Polk v.\n\n                               3\n\frecommended placement at a \"public/private separate\nschool.\" (A.185a). Accordingly, Michael attended a small\nprivate school for learning disabled students called the LAB\nSchool. The LAB School served only students with\ndisabilities, and therefore its students were segregated from\ntheir non-disabled peers. Michael attended the LAB School\nfor three years.\n\nWhen Michael and his father moved to Pennsylvania in\n1997, the father contacted Radnor educational authorities\nto obtain appropriate placement for Michael. Radnor\nconvened an \"IEP meeting\" to develop an interim program\nfor Michael for the 1997-98 school year. At this time,\nRadnor had not yet completed its own evaluation of\nMichael's educational needs. By letter dated August 26,\n1997, Radnor offered Michael two interim programming\noptions pending completion of its own evaluation of\nMichael's needs. Both of these options placed Michael at\nRadnor High School (\"Radnor High\"), a large public high\nschool with a total enrollment of approximately 800\nstudents, where Radnor believed it could effectively\nimplement the substance of Michael's Washington IEP. The\nfirst option, which Radnor characterizes as the\"learning\nsupport\" or \"LS\" option, involved enrolling Michael in\nmainstream English, science, social studies and elective\nclasses, and in special education mathematics and written\nexpression classes. This option also involved provision of\nsupport for homework and test preparation, and the\ndevelopment of study skills through a special education\nresource program. The second option, which Radnor\ncharacterizes as the \"emotional support\" or\"ES\" option,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCentral Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, 853 F.2d 171, 173 (3d\nCir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1030 (1989)). It \"must include, among\nother things, a statement of the child's current level of educational\nperformance, annual goals for the child, specific educational services to\nbe provided, and the extent to which the child will participate in regular\neducational programs.\" Id. (citing 34 C.F.R. 300.346, subsequently\nrecodified at 34 C.F.R. S 300.347 by 64 Fed. Reg. 12405, 12442 (Mar.\n12, 1999)).\n\n3. Under the IDEA, Washington, D.C. is considered a \"State.\" 20 U.S.C.\nS 1401(27).\n\n                               4\n\finvolved enrolling Michael in an \"Emotional Support\nProgram\" for English, science, social studies, health and\nphysical education classes, in \"learning support\" for\nmathematics, and in mainstream elective courses.\n\nMichael's father rejected these options, and unilaterally\ndecided to place Michael at the Hill Top School, a small\nprivate school for children with disabilities. In the fall of\n1997, before Radnor had completed Michael's evaluation,\nMichael and his father again relocated, this time to New\nJersey, for reasons related to the father's job. Michael had\nattended Hill Top for 41 days, during which time his father\nincurred tuition expenses in the amount of $4299.31.\nBecause Michael left Pennsylvania before Radnor officials\nhad completed their own evaluation of Michael's\neducational needs, Radnor never developed its own IEP for\nMichael.\n\nIn January 1998, after moving to New Jersey, Michael's\nfather initiated a due process hearing in Pennsylvania as\nprovided for by the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. S 1415(f). The purpose\nof this hearing was to determine whether the IDEA required\nRadnor to reimburse the father for the cost of Michael's Hill\nTop tuition. Both the local hearing officer and later the\nPennsylvania Special Education Appeals Panel rejected the\nfather's request. Both relied on a policy memorandum of\nthe United States Department of Education's Office of\nSpecial Education Programs (\"OSEP\") stating that when a\ndisabled student moves from one state to another, the new\nstate of residence is not required to adopt and implement\nthe most recent IEP developed for the student by the\nprevious state of residence.\n\nThe plaintiffs then instituted the present action against\nRadnor and PDE. PDE moved to dismiss their S 1983 claim\nagainst it based on the Eleventh Amendment. In addition,\nthe parties agreed that all claims could be decided on the\nadministrative record without further evidence, and cross-\nmoved for summary judgment. On February 5, 1999, the\ndistrict court granted PDE's motion to dismiss the S 1983\nclaim as to it, and also granted the defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment as to all claims and denied the\nplaintiffs' cross-motion, relying heavily on the OSEP policy\nmemorandum.\n\n                               5\n\fII.\n\nAlthough plaintiffs, Michael C. and his father, claimed\nnumerous statutory violations and one constitutional\nviolation in the district court, on appeal they seek relief on\nonly two of these grounds. First, they contend that the\nIDEA's \"pendency\" or \"stay-put\" provision, 20 U.S.C.\nS 1415(j), required Radnor to implement Michael's\nWashington IEP. Second, plaintiffs argue that Radnor's\nrefusal to implement Michael's Washington IEP violated his\nand his family's constitutional right to interstate travel. We\nexercise plenary review over the district court's order\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. See\nW.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 493 (3d Cir. 1995). The\nmaterial facts being undisputed, we therefore address\nplaintiffs' arguments that they, and not the defendants, are\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986);\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-52\n(1986).\n\n       A. Whether the IDEA Required Radnor to Implement\n       Michael's Washington IEP\n\nIn enacting the IDEA, Congress made known its strong\npreference for integrating students with disabilities into\nregular classrooms, and against segregating such students\nfrom their non-disabled peers unless absolutely necessary\nto provide them with an educational benefit. See 20 U.S.C.\nS 1412(a)(5)(A); Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988);\nOberti v. Board of Educ. of Borough of Clementon Sch. Dist.,\n995 F.2d 1204, 1213-14 (3d Cir. 1993). Nevertheless, cases\npresenting the reverse situation occasionally arise, where\nthe complaint is the school district's failure to segregate a\nchild from his or her non-disabled peers by placing that\nchild in a learning environment serving only disabled\nstudents. This is such a case.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the defendants' refusal to\nadopt Michael's Washington IEP and to implement that IEP\nby placing him in the segregated Hill Top school, as\nopposed to a more integrated learning program at Radnor\nHigh, violated the IDEA's \"pendency\" or \"stay-put\"\n\n                               6\n\fprovision. This provision, found at 20 U.S.C. S 1415(j),\nstates in pertinent part:\n\n       . . . [D]uring the pendency of any proceedings\n       conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or\n       local educational agency and the parents or guardian\n       otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-\n       current educational placement of such child, or, if\n       applying for initial admission to a public school, shall,\n       with the consent of the parents or guardian, be placed\n       in the public school program until all such proceedings\n       have been completed.4\n\nPlaintiffs argue that when Michael moved to Radnor\nTownship, the LAB School in Washington was Michael's\n\"then-current educational placement,\" and Radnor\neducational authorities' process of evaluating his\neducational needs constituted pending proceedings.\nAccordingly, plaintiffs contend that Radnor was obligated\nduring this time to implement Michael's Washington IEP,\nand that this required placing him at Hill Top, a private\nschool, which they assert provided the educational program\nmost similar to the one Michael received at the LAB School.\n\nThe district court agreed with the local hearing officer,\nthe state appeals board, and the defendants that the IDEA\nis silent on how to apply the pendency provision when a\nstudent transfers from another state. It therefore accorded\ndeference to the federal OSEP Policy Memorandum 96-5.\nThat memorandum states in pertinent part:\n\n       [E]ntitlement to a [free appropriate public education,\n       or] FAPE, by its terms, encompasses an appropriate\n       educational program that is individually-designed for\n       each student in accordance with the requirements of\n       Part B [of IDEA] and the educational standards of the\n       State in which the student's parents reside. In\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In 1997, Congress amended the IDEA. These amendments, which for\nthe most part became effective on June 4, 1997, substantially\nreorganized the statute. They also slightly modified the stay-put\nprovision, which previously was found at 20 U.S.C.S 1415(e)(3)(A).\nHowever, the 1997 amendments do not appear to have altered this\nprovision in any way relevant to this appeal.\n\n                               7\n\f       addition, under 34 C.F.R. S 300.600, each State must\n       exercise a general supervision over all programs in the\n       State that provide educational services to disabled\n       students, and must ensure that all such programs\n       meet State education standards and Part B\n       requirements.\n\n        When a student moves from a school district in State\n       A to a school district in State B, the State B school\n       district first must ascertain whether it will adopt the\n       most recent evaluation and IEP developed for the\n       student by the State A school district. Since the State\n       A school district's evaluation and IEP were based in\n       part on the educational standards and eligibility\n       requirements of State A, the student's evaluation and\n       IEP developed by the State A school district might not\n       necessarily be consistent with the educational\n       standards of State B. Therefore, the State B school\n       district must determine, as an initial matter, whether\n       it believes that the student has a disability and\n       whether the most recent evaluation of the student\n       conducted by the school district in State A and the\n       State A school district's IEP meet the requirements of\n       Part B and well as the educational standards of State\n       B.\n\nOSEP Policy Memorandum 96-5, reprinted in 24 Indiv.\nDisabil. Educ. L. Rptr. 320 (U.S. Dep't Educ. Dec. 6, 1995).\nThe district court therefore held that the pendency\nprovision did not require implementation of Michael's\nWashington IEP.\n\nOn appeal, plaintiffs make two arguments. First, they\ncontend that the OSEP Policy Memorandum is not entitled\nto deference because the plain language of the pendency\nprovision and federal judicial and administrative decisions\ninterpreting this provision dictate a contrary result. Second,\nthey argue that regardless of the interpretation given the\nIDEA's pendency provision, Pennsylvania regulations,\nwhich the IDEA incorporates into its scheme, contain a\nbroader pendency requirement, and the Pennsylvania\npendency regulation dictates a contrary result. Radnor and\nPDE dispute these arguments, and in addition contend that\nbecause no \"proceedings\" under section 1415 were pending\n\n                               8\n\fwhile Michael resided in Radnor Township, the stay-put\nprovision is inapplicable. We address these arguments in\norder.\n\n1. Application of the IDEA's Stay-Put Provision\n\nIn interpreting a congressional enactment, a court must\nfirst \" `determine whether the language at issue has a plain\nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular\ndispute in the case.' \" Deane v. Pocono Med. Ctr., 142 F.3d\n138, 146 (3d Cir. 1998) (en banc) (quoting Robinson v. Shell\nOil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997)). \"The plainness or\nambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference\nto the language itself, the specific context in which that\nlanguage is used, and the broader context of the statute as\na whole.\" Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The IDEA is silent on\nhow its pendency provision is to be applied to students who\ntransfer interstate versus students who transfer intrastate,\nand the plain language of the pendency provision is at best\nambiguous with respect to this issue. On its face, it is not\nclear that Congress intended the requirement that a\nstudent remain in his or her \"then-current educational\nplacement\" to apply to students who relocate from one state\nto another. For example, a student's prior placement no\nlonger seems \"current\" after he or she withdraws from that\nplacement and moves away. Moreover, it is impossible for\nthe student's new school district in Pennsylvania to keep\nthe student in his or her previous school as required by the\n\"stay put\" provision where that school is in another state.\nTherefore, we must look beyond the isolated text of section\n1415(j) for guidance on how to apply this provision in this\ncase. See, e.g., United States v. Balascsak, 873 F.2d 673,\n679 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nOSEP is the agency charged with principal responsibility\nfor administering the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. S 1402(a). The\nportion of OSEP Policy Memorandum 96-5 relevant to this\ncase is properly characterized as an interpretive rule\nbecause it imposes no substantive obligations, but rather\nclarifies that the IDEA's pendency provision does not apply\nto situations where a student moves from one state to\n\n                               9\n\fanother. See Bailey v. Sullivan, 885 F.2d 52, 62 (3d Cir.\n1989) (en banc).5\n\nThe district court deferred to OSEP Policy Memorandum\n96-5, citing Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). This court has\nheld that the level of deference to be accorded such\ninterpretive rules depends upon their persuasiveness.\n\"Admittedly, [they] do not rise to the level of a regulation\nand do not have the effect of law. A court is not required to\ngive effect to an administrative interpretation. . .. Instead,\nthe level of deference given to an interpretive bulletin is\ngoverned by the bulletin's persuasiveness.\" Brooks v. Village\nof Ridgefield Park, 185 F.3d 130, 135 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(citations omitted). See Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center\nfor Women v. Knoll, 61 F.3d 170, 182 (3d Cir. 1995)\n(deferring to HHS directive interpreting Hyde Amendment\nrestricting use of Medicaid funds to fund abortions, and\nholding that HHS interpretation preempted Pennsylvania\nlaw), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1093 (1996); see also Honig,\n484 U.S. at 325 n.8 (according deference to OSEP policy\nletter setting forth agency's interpretation of phrase \"change\nin placement\" in IDEA's predecessor statute).\n\nThe conclusion expressed in OSEP Policy Memorandum\n96-5 that one state need not automatically accept and\nimplement an IEP developed by another state does not\nappear to conflict with any previous or subsequent position\ntaken by that agency. As we now discuss in greater detail,\nbecause this aspect of the policy memorandum is well-\nreasoned and persuasive in that it comports with the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. As it did before the district court, Radnor takes issue with portions\nof\nthe OSEP Policy Memorandum suggesting that where a disabled student\nwith a functioning IEP in State A moves to State B, State B authorities\nshould follow a procedure for interim assessment and program\nimplementation prescribed therein. Although Radnor asserts that it\nsatisfied OSEP's suggested procedures in this case, it contends that\nOSEP lacks authority under IDEA to impose these affirmative\nrequirements on school districts. It is unnecessary for us to reach this\nissue, however (see Op. at 6 n.7; Radnor Br. at 18-19), and we express\nno opinion on these portions of OSEP's memorandum. Rather, our\nanalysis is restricted to the memorandum's conclusion that one state\nneed not adopt and implement an IEP developed by another state.\n\n                               10\n\fIDEA's statutory and regulatory scheme and with precedent\ninterpreting that scheme, we are persuaded that the district\ncourt did not err in its thoughtful analysis and conclusion\nto defer to the memorandum.6\n\nThere are strong reasons for that deference and the result\nreached by the district court. The IDEA recognizes that\neducation is traditionally a state function. Accordingly, it\nleaves the responsibility of providing a free appropriate\npublic education, or \"FAPE,\" to students with disabilities to\nstate and local educational authorities. See 20 U.S.C.\nS 1400(c)(6) (1998); 20 U.S.C. S 1400(b)(8) (1996); 34 C.F.R.\nSS 300.13, 300.600 (1999). Provision of a FAPE requires\nthat special education and related services must\"meet the\nstandards of the State educational agency,\" and must\n\"include an appropriate preschool, elementary, or\nsecondary school education in the State involved.\" 20\nU.S.C. S 1401(8) (1998); 20 U.S.C. S 1401(18) (1996). Under\ncurrent section 1412, States are eligible for federal financial\nassistance only when the state demonstrates that it\"has in\neffect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets\" the\nconditions imposed, including that it makes available a\nFAPE to children with disabilities residing in that state. 20\nU.S.C. S 1412(a) (1998). A local educational authority is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Citing to 20 U.S.C. S 1407(f), plaintiffs argue that the 1997 IDEA\namendments make clear that OSEP's policy statements are not entitled\nto the force of law. Presumably, plaintiffs intended to cite to S 1406(f),\nwhich states that where the Secretary responds to an inquiry regarding\na policy, question, or interpretation under Part B of the IDEA, that\nresponse \"shall include an explanation that the written response--\n\n(1) is provided as informal guidance and is not legally binding; and\n\n(2) represents an interpretation by the Department of Education of the\napplicable statutory or regulatory requirements in the context of the\nspecific facts presented.\"\n\nAssuming that Policy Memorandum 96-5 is the type of response\nreferred to by this provision, section 1406(f) merely imposes a\nrequirement that the DOE response put readers on notice that it is not\nlegally binding. This requirement, which was not effective when OSEP\npublished Policy Memorandum 96-5, does not prevent us from\nconsidering DOE policy statements to be persuasive and therefore\nworthy of deference.\n\n                               11\n\feligible to receive these federal funds only if it \"has in effect\npolicies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with\nthe State policies and procedures established under section\n1412.\" 20 U.S.C. S 1413 (1998).\n\nBecause Congress left primary responsibility for providing\na FAPE and for implementing the IDEA to the states, we\nbelieve it unlikely that Congress intended the stay-put\nprovision, which dates back to 1975 and the IDEA's\npredecessor statute, to impose a requirement on states that\nthey must implement an IEP established in another state\nwithout considering how consistent that IEP is with the\npolicies and mandates of the student's new residential\nstate.\n\nPrecedent interpreting the IDEA's pendency requirement\nsupports this interpretation. As the parties observe, the\nstay-put provision was intended to serve as a type of\n\"automatic preliminary injunction\" preventing local\neducational authorities from unilaterally changing a\nstudent's existing educational program. See Drinker v.\nColonial School Dist., 78 F.3d 859, 864 (3d Cir. 1996).\nWhere the student's existing IEP calls for public school\nplacement with educational supports to compensate for the\nchild's disability, the stay-put provision may require that\nlocal educational authorities not unilaterally attempt to alter\nthe IEP by placing the child in segregated, non-regular\neducation classes. See, e.g., Honig, 484 U.S. at 323-28;\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1220-24. Conversely, where the\nstudent's existing IEP requires placement in a private\nschool, the stay-put provision may require that local\nauthorities not unilaterally attempt to alter the IEP by\nplacing the student in a public, regular education classes.\nSee Drinker, 78 F.3d at 867; Jarczynski v. St. Mary's\nCounty Pub. Sch., 29 Indiv. Disabil. Educ. L. Rep. 49 (D.\nMd. Oct. 13, 1998).\n\nHowever, where a parent unilaterally removes a child\nfrom an existing placement determined in accordance with\nstate procedures, and puts the child in a different\nplacement that was not assigned through proper state\nprocedures, the protections of the stay-put provision are\ninoperative until the state or local educational authorities\nand the parents agree on a new placement. See Susquenita\n\n                               12\n\fSch. Dist. v. Raelee S., 96 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir. 1996).7 Only\nonce state authorities and parents have reached such\nagreement does a \"then-current educational placement\"\ncome into existence. Id. In the instant case, it is Michael's\nfather who unilaterally removed Michael from the LAB\nSchool when he moved the family to Radnor Township.\nNeither Washington educational authorities nor\nPennsylvania authorities played any role in this decision.\nThe plaintiffs now claim that upon moving to Pennsylvania,\nRadnor should have placed Michael at the Hill Top School\nrather than at Radnor High. However, his father never\nreached any agreement with Radnor or with other\nPennsylvania educational authorities that Michael should\nbe placed in a segregated, private school. Therefore,\nMichael had no \"then-current educational placement\" in the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the stay-put provision\nprovides no relief for him.\n\nWe hold that the IDEA's overall scheme and the\nprecedent interpreting that scheme leads inexorably to the\nconclusion that when a student moves from State A to\nState B, any prior IEP in effect in State A need not be\ntreated by State B as continuing automatically in effect.\nThis interpretation of the inapplicability of the stay-put\nprovision may, as plaintiffs claim, lead to the initial result\nthat \"disabled students like Michael with comprehensive\nand long-standing IEP's . . . can be forced upon an\ninterstate move to somehow cope in regular education\nwithout supports while the district and the parent resolve\nany IEP dispute.\" (Appellant's Br. at 14 (emphasis in\noriginal)). But if parents believe that private school\nplacement remains the only way to provide the student with\nthe educational benefit required by the IDEA, or otherwise\ndisagree with an IEP proposal, they can place the child in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We note that this scenario is distinguishable from the situation in\nwhich a parent unilaterally removes a child previously determined to be\ndisabled from one school district and moves the child to another school\ndistrict in the same state. In the latter situation, the child's\neducational\nplacement has already been determined in accordance with state\nprocedures and with the consent of the child's parents, and his or her\nIEP bears the imprimatur of that state. See Inquiry of Rieser, OSEP\nPolicy Letter, July 17, 1986 (U.S. Dep't Educ. 1986).\n\n                               13\n\fa private school, initiate a due process hearing, and seek\nreimbursement from educational authorities later. 8 See\nFlorence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 15\n(1993); School Comm. of Town of Burlington, Mass. v.\nDepartment of Educ. of Commonwealth of Mass., 471 U.S.\n359, 369-73 (1985). Of course, they act at their own\nfinancial risk, and will recover only if they are correct that\nlocal authorities have failed to provide the educational\nprogram to which their child is entitled under the IDEA.\nBurlington, 471 U.S. at 373-74. The plaintiffs' contention\nthat these parents would have to keep paying private school\ntuition out of pocket for \"years\" is meritless, as federal and\nstate regulations impose strict timing requirements on the\ncompletion of evaluations, the development and\nimplementation of IEPs, and review of challenges to a local\neducational authority's proposal or refusal to initiate or\nchange the identification, evaluation, or educational\nplacement of a child or the provision of FAPE to a child. See\n34 C.F.R. SS 300.504(a), 300.512; 22 Pa. CodeSS 14.25(m),\n342.25(p) (timeline for completion of multidisciplinary\nevaluations); 22 Pa. Code. S 14.32(i) (timeline for\npreparation and implementation of IEPs); 22 Pa. Code\nSS 14.63, 14.64(o) (timelines for requesting and holding\nprehearing conference or due process hearing). We are\nmindful that this interpretation may bind the hands of\nparents who cannot afford to pay private school tuition out-\nof-pocket and await future reimbursement. This same\nresult, however, can occur where parents of a student who\ntransfers intrastate disagree with the new school district's\nplacement of their child, and appears to be an unfortunate\nreality of the system Congress created.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the interpretation adopted by\nOSEP in Policy Memorandum 96-5 is a reasonable\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Because Pennsylvania never established an IEP for Michael, it is not\ncertain that Radnor's interim educational plan for Michael was\ninappropriate. The administrative hearing officer concluded that the\ninterim options proposed by Radnor would have closely approximated\nthe placement Michael received at the LAB School. The district court\nfound that this conclusion was supported by substantial evidence on the\nrecord as a whole (Op. at 8 n.10), and plaintiffs have not appealed this\ndetermination.\n\n                               14\n\faccommodation of the stay-put provision and the overriding\npurposes and structure of the IDEA, and we are persuaded\nthat this interpretation deserves deference.9\n\n       2. Pennsylvania's Regulatory Pendency Requirement\n\nNevertheless, even though the IDEA's stay-put provision\ndoes not provide a basis for relief, \"[f]ederal law\nincorporates state standards, and a school district may\nviolate the IDEA if it fails to satisfy the more stringent state\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. We note that an additional reason for adopting OSEP's interpretation\nof the stay-put provision, not asserted by the parties, may lie in the\nlimited congressional authority under which the provision was originally\nenacted. The stay-put provision dates back to 1975, when it was enacted\nas section 615(e)(3) of the IDEA's predecessor statute, the Education for\nAll Handicapped Children Act. See Pub. L. No. 94-142, 1975\nU.S.C.C.A.N. (89 Stat.) 773, 789. Congressional authority for passage of\nthis statute derived from its spending power, U.S. Const. art. I, S 8, and\nthat act functioned by conditioning state and local educational\nauthorities' eligibility for federal funds upon their satisfaction of\ncertain\nconditions favorable to education of disabled students. See Board of\nEduc. of the Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176,\n204 n.26 (1982). The Supreme Court has stated that\"if Congress\nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do\nso unambiguously.\" Id. (quoting Pennhurst State School v. Halderman,\n451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).\n\nHowever, we note one wrinkle in this analysis. The 1997 amendments\nto the IDEA altered the statute's \"findings\" provision to include language\ninvoking the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\n18 U.S.C. S 1400(c)(6)-(10). This addition of the Fourteenth Amendment\nas a constitutional basis for passage of the 1997 IDEA amendments may\nundercut this spending power argument. Nevertheless, after the 1997\namendments, the stay-put provision remained substantially identical to\nits previous text, was placed in \"Part B\" (subchapter II) of the amended\nstatute, which is entitled \"Assistance for Education of All Children with\nDisabilities,\" Pub L. No. 105-17, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. (111 Stat.) 37, 49,\nand continued to appear in 20 U.S.C. S 1415, subpart (a) of which\nexplicitly states that the procedures established by that section are\nconditions imposed upon \"[a]ny State educational agency, State agency,\nor local educational agency that receives assistance under this\nsubchapter.\"\n\nRegardless, the parties have not raised or briefed this argument, and\nwe do not rely on it in deciding this appeal.\n\n                               15\n\flaw requirements.\" Frith v. Galeton Area Sch. Dist., 900 F.\nSupp. 706, 712 n.9 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (citing Doe v. Board of\nEduc. of Tullahoma City Sch., 9 F.3d 455, 457 (6th Cir.\n1993) (per curiam), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1108 (1994)); see\nalso Board of Educ. of East Windsor Regional Sch. Dist. v.\nDiamond, 808 F.2d 987, 992 (3d Cir. 1986). The plaintiffs\nargue that a Pennsylvania regulation imposes a more\nstringent pendency requirement than that imposed by IDEA\nitself or by DOE regulations. The regulation in question\nstates:\n\n       No change in the identification, evaluation, educational\n       placement or IEP of an exceptional student or an\n       eligible young child may be made during the pendency\n       of an administrative or judicial proceeding unless\n       agreed upon by the parties to the proceeding.\n\n22 Pa. Code S 14.61(b).\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that this regulation's prohibition\non changes in a child's \"identification, evaluation,\neducational placement, or IEP\" is broader than the federal\nprohibition on changes in a child's \"then-current\neducational placement,\" and that this broader sweep\nincludes evaluations and IEP's from other states. One\nfederal district court has noted in dictum that the\nPennsylvania regulation is \"much more prohibitive than its\nfederal counterpart\" in that S 14.64(b) prohibits re-\nevaluation during the pendency of proceedings, whereas the\nfederal stay-put provision only prohibits a change in\neducational placement. See Delaware County Intermediate\nUnit # 25 v. Martin & Melinda K., 831 F. Supp. 1206, 1223\nn.25 (E.D. Pa. 1993). However, two other federal courts,\nincluding this court, have noted that the requirements of\nS 14.64(b) \"track\" the federal standard. See Drinker, 78 F.3d\nat 864 n.11; Matthew K. v. Parkland Sch. Dist., No. Civ. A.\n97-6636, 1998 WL 84009, at *5 n.6 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 26,\n1998).\n\nThe district court rejected Michael's contention, holding\nthat \"the Pennsylvania regulations are silent on accepting\nout of state IEP's.\" (Op. at 7 n.8). We believe the district\ncourt was right to do so for two reasons. First,\nPennsylvania regulations contain a provision expressly\nrequiring that:\n\n                               16\n\f       If an exceptional student moves from one school\n       district in this Commonwealth to another, the new\n       district shall implement the existing IEP to the extent\n       possible or shall provide the services and programs\n       specified in an interim IEP agreed to by the parents\n       until a new IEP is developed and implemented in\n       accordance with this [and other] sections[ ] . . . and\n       until the completion of due process proceedings . . . .\n\n22 Pa. Code. S 14.31(c). The existence of this specific\nregulatory provision is significant because a parallel\nprovision dealing with students who move from another\nstate to a school district in Pennsylvania, and who had\npreviously been educated in accordance with an IEP\ndeveloped in that other state, is conspicuously absent from\nthese regulations. This absence evidences a lack of intent\non the part of Pennsylvania regulators to address Michael's\nsituation.\n\nSecond, the Pennsylvania appeals panel, the highest\nadministrative authority of the Commonwealth to opine in\nthis case, concluded that because the federal pendency\nprovision did not apply, once plaintiffs rejected Radnor's\ninterim IEP offer, \"Michael was considered a regular\neducation student.\" (A.119a). Presumably, had this state\nadministrative panel construed Pennsylvania regulations to\nmandate implementation of the Washington IEP, it would\nhave so held in its analysis.10\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Pennsylvania regulations do\nnot require a Pennsylvania school district such as Radnor\nto implement the IEP formulated in another state.\n\n       3. \"Proceedings\"\n\nIn addition, even if we did interpret the IDEA's stay-put\nprovision to require a state to implement an IEP developed\nby another state, this provision is not applicable in this\ncase because by its terms, it applies only to attempts to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. In addition, the local hearing officer directly rejected plaintiffs'\nargument, finding that Pennsylvania's regulations are merely\n\"clarifications of how to implement the federal IDEA requirements within\nPennsylvania.\" (A.127a-28a).\n\n                                17\n\falter a student's current educational placement \"during the\npendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this\nsection.\" 20 U.S.C. S 1415(j) (emphasis added). (See Radnor\nBr. at 9; PDE Br. at 14). Radnor and PDE contend that the\nearliest proceeding that can be conducted pursuant to\nsection 1415 is a due process hearing (conducted pursuant\nto section 1415(f)), and that since Michael had already\nmoved to New Jersey when he requested a due process\nhearing, no proceeding \"conducted pursuant to\" section\n1415 was pending at the time he resided in Radnor\nTownship.\n\nThe district court rejected this argument, holding that\nproceedings under section 1415 included \"the opportunity\nof the parent or guardian to inspect relevant records with\nrespect to the child's evaluation, and the notice\nrequirement the school district must satisfy when making\nthe initial placement decision,\" both of which had begun\nwhile Michael lived in Radnor Township. (Op. at 4 n.4). The\ndistrict court characterized these as \"proceedings set forth\nin S 1415(b),\" and noted that both \"are part of the process\nby which a school district changes a student's placement,\nbut by definition occur before the start of a due process\nhearing.\"\n\nIn this respect, the district court was mistaken. The types\nof proceedings dealt with in section 1415(b), which include\nthe conduct and development of evaluations, eligibility\ndeterminations, IEPs, and educational placement, arise\nunder section 1414. Section 1415(b) merely sets forth\n\"procedures\" to be observed during these \"proceedings.\"\nTherefore, no proceedings conducted pursuant to section\n1415 were pending during the time Radnor offered to place\nMichael in Radnor High and his father instead placed him\nat Hill Top.11 See Verhoeven v. Brunswick Sch. Comm., ___\nF.3d ___, No. 98-2348, 1999 WL 721698, at *5 (1st Cir.\nSept. 21, 1999) (stay-put provision applies during pendency\nof \"administrative and judicial proceedings challenging a\nplacement decision\"); Kari H. v. Franklin Special Sch. Dist.,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We do not address whether the mediation procedures codified at\nsection 1415(e) by the 1997 IDEA amendments qualify as \"proceedings\nconducted pursuant to\" section 1415 under the pendency requirement.\n\n                               18\n\fNos. 96-5066 and 96-5178, 1997 WL 468326, at *6 (6th\nCir. Aug. 12 1997) (per curiam) (only three types of\nproceedings arise under section 1415 -- due process\nhearings, state administrative review, and civil judicial\nreview actions in state or federal court).12\n\nBecause we conclude that neither the stay-put provision\nnor Pennsylvania regulations required Radnor to implement\nMichael's Washington IEP, and that no proceedings were\npending in Pennsylvania while Michael resided there, we\ntherefore hold that plaintiffs' claim for reimbursement\nunder the IDEA must fail.13\n\nB. Michael's Constitutional Right to Travel\n\nThe plaintiffs also contend that Radnor's failure to\nimplement Michael's Washington IEP violated their\nFourteenth Amendment right to travel interstate by denying\nMichael benefits that would be afforded to a disabled\nstudent who transferred intrastate, from one Pennsylvania\nschool district to another. We disagree.14\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. See also Drinker, 78 F.3d at 863-64 (noting that stay-put provision\napplies during impartial due process hearing on parents' complaints\nregarding educational placement of handicapped children, and during\nstate or federal judicial review of final administrative proceedings,\nwithout comment about provision's application to earlier proceedings\ninvolving local educational authorities); Mrs. C. v. Wheaton, 916 F.2d 69,\n72 (2d Cir. 1990) (implying that pending \"proceedings\" means due\nprocess proceedings under section 1415); Smith v. Roher, Civ. A. No. 89-\n3258, 1991 WL 132545, at *1 (D.D.C. July 10, 1991) (stay-put provision\napplies once process of administrative review of placement decision is\ncommenced and remains in effect through completion of civil action in\ndistrict court).\n\n13. Although it does not appear that plaintiffs have appealed their claim\nunder the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. S 794, we note that the district\ncourt correctly concluded that this claim is derivative of their IDEA\nclaim\n(Op. at 9), and therefore this claim too must fail.\n\n14. In addition to granting summary judgment in favor of both\ndefendants on this claim, the district court also dismissed plaintiffs'\nS 1983 claim as to PDE based on that defendant's Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity. (Op. at 2 n.3). The plaintiffs have not argued that this\ndecision was erroneous, and we therefore do not consider that ruling\n\n                               19\n\fThe Court has described the constitutional right to travel\nas embracing at least three components: (1) the right of a\ncitizen of one state to enter and leave another state; (2) the\nright to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an\nunfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second\nstate; and (3) for those travelers who elect to become\npermanent residents, the right to be treated like citizens of\nthat state. See Saenz v. Roe, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 1525 (1999).\nThe plaintiffs contend that the last of these components is\nviolated by Radnor's refusal to honor Michael's Washington\nIEP. They base this assertion on the testimony of Radnor's\nDirector of Special Education that, had Michael been a\nPennsylvania resident who merely moved from another\nPennsylvania school district to Radnor, an IEP calling for\nprivate placement would have been honored. (A.154a).\n\nAdoption of the policy enunciated in OSEP Policy\nMemorandum 96-5, however, does not cause Michael to be\ntreated differently from other Pennsylvania residents. Every\nstudent in Pennsylvania identified as disabled is entitled to\nan evaluation, an IEP, and if warranted, a special\nplacement, in accordance with Pennsylvania procedures.\nHad Michael been a Pennsylvania resident transferring to\nRadnor from another Pennsylvania district, where he had\nalready been identified as disabled and was being educated\nin accordance with an IEP developed there, he would have\nalready submitted to these procedures. The District\nDirector of Special Education's testimony that Radnor\nwould have honored an IEP developed under such\ncircumstances flows logically from this view and in no way\naffects plaintiffs' right to travel interstate.\n\nMichael transferred from Washington, and had not yet\nundergone an evaluation in accordance with Pennsylvania\nprocedures, as every other disabled student enrolled in\nPennsylvania had. Therefore, in requiring that a new IEP be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npresented for our review. Accordingly, we discuss the plaintiffs' S 1983\nclaim as against Radnor only. Moreover, we do not address PDE's\nadditional argument that Michael has not adequately alleged that any\nPDE official was involved in the decision not to honor his Washington,\nD.C. IEP.\n\n                               20\n\fdeveloped, Radnor's treatment of Michael was not\ninconsistent with its treatment of Pennsylvania residents.\nIndeed, only by submitting to these procedures could\nPennsylvania determine if Michael even had a right (under\nthe IDEA) to a private placement. Pennsylvania decided\nthat, at least on an interim basis, Michael had no such\nright, and his educational needs could instead be met in a\nstructured public school placement. We need not pass on\nthe merits of that decision. See supra note 8.\n\nArguably, requiring a disabled student who has\nundergone evaluation and IEP development in a different\nstate to submit to this process a second time upon moving\nto a new state possibly may deter the student and his\nfamily from moving to the new state. However, an otherwise\nconstitutional law that incidentally discourages migration is\nnot necessarily rendered suspect or invalid merely because\nof such incidental effect. See Lawrence H. Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law S 15-14, at 1381 (2d ed. 1988).\n\nMichael has a right, established by the IDEA and defined\nby state law, to a free, appropriate public education.\nRadnor has done nothing to alter or deny Michael that\nright. It has not imposed different standards on the type of\neducation Michael may receive versus the type of education\na disabled student who moves from one school district to\nanother within Pennsylvania may receive. Thus, Michael\ncannot claim that Radnor's action in this case violated his\nright to travel under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, and consequently, cannot claim a\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. S 1983.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants and\ndenying summary judgment for the plaintiffs will be\naffirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                21\n\f",

The\nspecific question before us is whether the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C.S 1400 et\nseq., requires a Pennsylvania school district to provide a\nstudent with disabilities who relocates from another state\nwith an interim educational program identical to the\nprogram the student received in his or her prior state of\nresidence. Michael C., a student with disabilities, attended\na private school in Washington, D.C. under an\nIndividualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") formulated by\nWashington educational authorities. Michael and his father\nmoved from Washington to Radnor Township, Pennsylvania\nin the summer of 1997, and requested special educational\ntreatment from the Radnor Township School District\n(\"Radnor\"). Radnor responded with specific educational\nproposals but Michael's father rejected them, and\n\n                                  2\n\funilaterally placed Michael in a private school. Michael\nremained in this school for 41 days, after which his family\nagain moved, this time to New Jersey.\n\nMichael's father later initiated administrative proceedings\nseeking reimbursement for tuition costs incurred while\nMichael attended the private school in Pennsylvania. After\nunsuccessfully pursuing his administrative remedies,\nMichael's father filed this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nagainst Radnor and the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation (\"PDE\"), seeking tuition reimbursement and\nclaiming violations of the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. S 1415(j), the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. S 794, and the Civil Rights Act\nof 1871, 42 U.S.C. S 1983. He also claimed that Michael's\nand his family's right to travel interstate under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nhad been violated. On cross-motions for summary\njudgment, the district court entered summary judgment in\nfavor of Radnor and PDE as to all claims. The court also\ngranted PDE's separate motion for dismissal of theS 1983\nclaim as to it based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nThis timely appeal followed.1 We will affirm.\n\nI.\n\nThe facts of this case are undisputed. Michael, 17 years\nold at the time events relevant to this case occurred, is\nlearning disabled and suffers from severe hemophilia. Prior\nto August 1997, Michael and his father lived in Washington\nD.C. Pursuant to the IDEA, Washington public educational\nauthorities had developed an IEP2 for Michael.3 This IEP\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 20 U.S.C. S 1415(i) (formerly 20 U.S.C. S 1415(e)) and 28\nU.S.C. SS 1331 and 1343. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. S 1291.\n\n2. The IEP is the \"centerpiece\" of the IDEA. See Honig v.

Accordingly, Michael attended a small\nprivate school for learning disabled students called the LAB\nSchool. The LAB School served only students with\ndisabilities, and therefore its students were segregated from\ntheir non-disabled peers. Michael attended the LAB School\nfor three years.\n\nWhen Michael and his father moved to Pennsylvania in\n1997, the father contacted Radnor educational authorities\nto obtain appropriate placement for Michael. Radnor\nconvened an \"IEP meeting\" to develop an interim program\nfor Michael for the 1997-98 school year. At this time,\nRadnor had not yet completed its own evaluation of\nMichael's educational needs. By letter dated August 26,\n1997, Radnor offered Michael two interim programming\noptions pending completion of its own evaluation of\nMichael's needs. Both of these options placed Michael at\nRadnor High School (\"Radnor High\"), a large public high\nschool with a total enrollment of approximately 800\nstudents, where Radnor believed it could effectively\nimplement the substance of Michael's Washington IEP. The\nfirst option, which Radnor characterizes as the\"learning\nsupport\" or \"LS\" option, involved enrolling Michael in\nmainstream English, science, social studies and elective\nclasses, and in special education mathematics and written\nexpression classes. This option also involved provision of\nsupport for homework and test preparation, and the\ndevelopment of study skills through a special education\nresource program.

Under the IDEA, Washington, D.C. is considered a \"State.\" 20 U.S.C.\nS 1401(27).\n\n                               4\n\finvolved enrolling Michael in an \"Emotional Support\nProgram\" for English, science, social studies, health and\nphysical education classes, in \"learning support\" for\nmathematics, and in mainstream elective courses.\n\nMichael's father rejected these options, and unilaterally\ndecided to place Michael at the Hill Top School, a small\nprivate school for children with disabilities. In the fall of\n1997, before Radnor had completed Michael's evaluation,\nMichael and his father again relocated, this time to New\nJersey, for reasons related to the father's job. Michael had\nattended Hill Top for 41 days, during which time his father\nincurred tuition expenses in the amount of $4299.31.\nBecause Michael left Pennsylvania before Radnor officials\nhad completed their own evaluation of Michael's\neducational needs, Radnor never developed its own IEP for\nMichael.\n\nIn January 1998, after moving to New Jersey, Michael's\nfather initiated a due process hearing in Pennsylvania as\nprovided for by the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. S 1415(f). The purpose\nof this hearing was to determine whether the IDEA required\nRadnor to reimburse the father for the cost of Michael's Hill\nTop tuition. Both the local hearing officer and later the\nPennsylvania Special Education Appeals Panel rejected the\nfather's request. Both relied on a policy memorandum of\nthe United States Department of Education's Office of\nSpecial Education Programs (\"OSEP\") stating that when a\ndisabled student moves from one state to another, the new\nstate of residence is not required to adopt and implement\nthe most recent IEP developed for the student by the\nprevious state of residence.\n\nThe plaintiffs then instituted the present action against\nRadnor and PDE. PDE moved to dismiss their S 1983 claim\nagainst it based on the Eleventh Amendment. In addition,\nthe parties agreed that all claims could be decided on the\nadministrative record without further evidence, and cross-\nmoved for summary judgment. On February 5, 1999, the\ndistrict court granted PDE's motion to dismiss the S 1983\nclaim as to it, and also granted the defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment as to all claims and denied the\nplaintiffs' cross-motion, relying heavily on the OSEP policy\nmemorandum.\n\n                               5\n\fII.\n\nAlthough plaintiffs, Michael C. and his father, claimed\nnumerous statutory violations and one constitutional\nviolation in the district court, on appeal they seek relief on\nonly two of these grounds. First, they contend that the\nIDEA's \"pendency\" or \"stay-put\" provision, 20 U.S.C.\nS 1415(j), required Radnor to implement Michael's\nWashington IEP. Second, plaintiffs argue that Radnor's\nrefusal to implement Michael's Washington IEP violated his\nand his family's constitutional right to interstate travel. We\nexercise plenary review over the district court's order\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. See\nW.B. v.

Whether the IDEA Required Radnor to Implement\n       Michael's Washington IEP\n\nIn enacting the IDEA, Congress made known its strong\npreference for integrating students with disabilities into\nregular classrooms, and against segregating such students\nfrom their non-disabled peers unless absolutely necessary\nto provide them with an educational benefit. See 20 U.S.C.\nS 1412(a)(5)(A); Honig v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111982\"><a href=\"/opinion/111982/honig-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (1988);\nOberti v.

Nevertheless, cases\npresenting the reverse situation occasionally arise, where\nthe complaint is the school district's failure to segregate a\nchild from his or her non-disabled peers by placing that\nchild in a learning environment serving only disabled\nstudents. This is such a case.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the defendants' refusal to\nadopt Michael's Washington IEP and to implement that IEP\nby placing him in the segregated Hill Top school, as\nopposed to a more integrated learning program at Radnor\nHigh, violated the IDEA's \"pendency\" or \"stay-put\"\n\n                               6\n\fprovision. This provision, found at 20 U.S.C. S 1415(j),\nstates in pertinent part:\n\n       . . . [D]uring the pendency of any proceedings\n       conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or\n       local educational agency and the parents or guardian\n       otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-\n       current educational placement of such child, or, if\n       applying for initial admission to a public school, shall,\n       with the consent of the parents or guardian, be placed\n       in the public school program until all such proceedings\n       have been completed.4\n\nPlaintiffs argue that when Michael moved to Radnor\nTownship, the LAB School in Washington was Michael's\n\"then-current educational placement,\" and Radnor\neducational authorities' process of evaluating his\neducational needs constituted pending proceedings.\nAccordingly, plaintiffs contend that Radnor was obligated\nduring this time to implement Michael's Washington IEP,\nand that this required placing him at Hill Top, a private\nschool, which they assert provided the educational program\nmost similar to the one Michael received at the LAB School.\n\nThe district court agreed with the local hearing officer,\nthe state appeals board, and the defendants that the IDEA\nis silent on how to apply the pendency provision when a\nstudent transfers from another state. It therefore accorded\ndeference to the federal OSEP Policy Memorandum 96-5.\nThat memorandum states in pertinent part:\n\n       [E]ntitlement to a [free appropriate public education,\n       or] FAPE, by its terms, encompasses an appropriate\n       educational program that is individually-designed for\n       each student in accordance with the requirements of\n       Part B [of IDEA] and the educational standards of the\n       State in which the student's parents reside. In\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In 1997, Congress amended the IDEA. These amendments, which for\nthe most part became effective on June 4, 1997, substantially\nreorganized the statute. They also slightly modified the stay-put\nprovision, which previously was found at 20 U.S.C.S 1415(e)(3)(A).\nHowever, the 1997 amendments do not appear to have altered this\nprovision in any way relevant to this appeal.\n\n                               7\n\f       addition, under 34 C.F.R. S 300.600, each State must\n       exercise a general supervision over all programs in the\n       State that provide educational services to disabled\n       students, and must ensure that all such programs\n       meet State education standards and Part B\n       requirements.\n\n        When a student moves from a school district in State\n       A to a school district in State B, the State B school\n       district first must ascertain whether it will adopt the\n       most recent evaluation and IEP developed for the\n       student by the State A school district. Since the State\n       A school district's evaluation and IEP were based in\n       part on the educational standards and eligibility\n       requirements of State A, the student's evaluation and\n       IEP developed by the State A school district might not\n       necessarily be consistent with the educational\n       standards of State B. Therefore, the State B school\n       district must determine, as an initial matter, whether\n       it believes that the student has a disability and\n       whether the most recent evaluation of the student\n       conducted by the school district in State A and the\n       State A school district's IEP meet the requirements of\n       Part B and well as the educational standards of State\n       B.\n\nOSEP Policy Memorandum 96-5, reprinted in 24 Indiv.\nDisabil. Educ. L. Rptr. 320 (U.S. Dep't Educ. Dec. 6, 1995).\nThe district court therefore held that the pendency\nprovision did not require implementation of Michael's\nWashington IEP.\n\nOn appeal, plaintiffs make two arguments. First, they\ncontend that the OSEP Policy Memorandum is not entitled\nto deference because the plain language of the pendency\nprovision and federal judicial and administrative decisions\ninterpreting this provision dictate a contrary result. Second,\nthey argue that regardless of the interpretation given the\nIDEA's pendency provision, Pennsylvania regulations,\nwhich the IDEA incorporates into its scheme, contain a\nbroader pendency requirement, and the Pennsylvania\npendency regulation dictates a contrary result. Radnor and\nPDE dispute these arguments, and in addition contend that\nbecause no \"proceedings\" under section 1415 were pending\n\n                               8\n\fwhile Michael resided in Radnor Township, the stay-put\nprovision is inapplicable. We address these arguments in\norder.\n\n1. Application of the IDEA's Stay-Put Provision\n\nIn interpreting a congressional enactment, a court must\nfirst \" `determine whether the language at issue has a plain\nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular\ndispute in the case.' \" Deane v.

The IDEA is silent on\nhow its pendency provision is to be applied to students who\ntransfer interstate versus students who transfer intrastate,\nand the plain language of the pendency provision is at best\nambiguous with respect to this issue. On its face, it is not\nclear that Congress intended the requirement that a\nstudent remain in his or her \"then-current educational\nplacement\" to apply to students who relocate from one state\nto another. For example, a student's prior placement no\nlonger seems \"current\" after he or she withdraws from that\nplacement and moves away. Moreover, it is impossible for\nthe student's new school district in Pennsylvania to keep\nthe student in his or her previous school as required by the\n\"stay put\" provision where that school is in another state.\nTherefore, we must look beyond the isolated text of section\n1415(j) for guidance on how to apply this provision in this\ncase. See, e.g., United States v. Balascsak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522183\"><a href=\"/opinion/522183/united-states-v-balascsak-robert-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n679 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nOSEP is the agency charged with principal responsibility\nfor administering the IDEA. 20 U.S.C.

As we now discuss in greater detail,\nbecause this aspect of the policy memorandum is well-\nreasoned and persuasive in that it comports with the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. As it did before the district court, Radnor takes issue with portions\nof\nthe OSEP Policy Memorandum suggesting that where a disabled student\nwith a functioning IEP in State A moves to State B, State B authorities\nshould follow a procedure for interim assessment and program\nimplementation prescribed therein. Although Radnor asserts that it\nsatisfied OSEP's suggested procedures in this case, it contends that\nOSEP lacks authority under IDEA to impose these affirmative\nrequirements on school districts. It is unnecessary for us to reach this\nissue, however (see Op. at 6 n.7; Radnor Br. at 18-19), and we express\nno opinion on these portions of OSEP's memorandum. Rather, our\nanalysis is restricted to the memorandum's conclusion that one state\nneed not adopt and implement an IEP developed by another state.\n\n                               10\n\fIDEA's statutory and regulatory scheme and with precedent\ninterpreting that scheme, we are persuaded that the district\ncourt did not err in its thoughtful analysis and conclusion\nto defer to the memorandum.6\n\nThere are strong reasons for that deference and the result\nreached by the district court. The IDEA recognizes that\neducation is traditionally a state function. Accordingly, it\nleaves the responsibility of providing a free appropriate\npublic education, or \"FAPE,\" to students with disabilities to\nstate and local educational authorities. See 20 U.S.C.\nS 1400(c)(6) (1998); 20 U.S.C. S 1400(b)(8) (1996); 34 C.F.R.\nSS 300.13, 300.600 (1999). Provision of a FAPE requires\nthat special education and related services must\"meet the\nstandards of the State educational agency,\" and must\n\"include an appropriate preschool, elementary, or\nsecondary school education in the State involved.\" 20\nU.S.C. S 1401(8) (1998); 20 U.S.C. S 1401(18) (1996). Under\ncurrent section 1412, States are eligible for federal financial\nassistance only when the state demonstrates that it\"has in\neffect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets\" the\nconditions imposed, including that it makes available a\nFAPE to children with disabilities residing in that state. 20\nU.S.C. S 1412(a) (1998). A local educational authority is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Citing to 20 U.S.C. S 1407(f), plaintiffs argue that the 1997 IDEA\namendments make clear that OSEP's policy statements are not entitled\nto the force of law. Presumably, plaintiffs intended to cite to S 1406(f),\nwhich states that where the Secretary responds to an inquiry regarding\na policy, question, or interpretation under Part B of the IDEA, that\nresponse \"shall include an explanation that the written response--\n\n(1) is provided as informal guidance and is not legally binding; and\n\n(2) represents an interpretation by the Department of Education of the\napplicable statutory or regulatory requirements in the context of the\nspecific facts presented.\"\n\nAssuming that Policy Memorandum 96-5 is the type of response\nreferred to by this provision, section 1406(f) merely imposes a\nrequirement that the DOE response put readers on notice that it is not\nlegally binding. This requirement, which was not effective when OSEP\npublished Policy Memorandum 96-5, does not prevent us from\nconsidering DOE policy statements to be persuasive and therefore\nworthy of deference.\n\n                               11\n\feligible to receive these federal funds only if it \"has in effect\npolicies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with\nthe State policies and procedures established under section\n1412.\" 20 U.S.C. S 1413 (1998).\n\nBecause Congress left primary responsibility for providing\na FAPE and for implementing the IDEA to the states, we\nbelieve it unlikely that Congress intended the stay-put\nprovision, which dates back to 1975 and the IDEA's\npredecessor statute, to impose a requirement on states that\nthey must implement an IEP established in another state\nwithout considering how consistent that IEP is with the\npolicies and mandates of the student's new residential\nstate.\n\nPrecedent interpreting the IDEA's pendency requirement\nsupports this interpretation. As the parties observe, the\nstay-put provision was intended to serve as a type of\n\"automatic preliminary injunction\" preventing local\neducational authorities from unilaterally changing a\nstudent's existing educational program. See Drinker v.\nColonial School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714807\"><a href=\"/opinion/714807/daniel-drinker-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-ned-drinker-and-diane/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864 (3d Cir. 1996).\nWhere the student's existing IEP calls for public school\nplacement with educational supports to compensate for the\nchild's disability, the stay-put provision may require that\nlocal educational authorities not unilaterally attempt to alter\nthe IEP by placing the child in segregated, non-regular\neducation classes. See, e.g., Honig, 484 U.S. at 323-28;\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1220-24. Conversely, where the\nstudent's existing IEP requires placement in a private\nschool, the stay-put provision may require that local\nauthorities not unilaterally attempt to alter the IEP by\nplacing the student in a public, regular education classes.\nSee Drinker, 78 F.3d at 867; Jarczynski v.

Id. In the instant case, it is Michael's\nfather who unilaterally removed Michael from the LAB\nSchool when he moved the family to Radnor Township.\nNeither Washington educational authorities nor\nPennsylvania authorities played any role in this decision.\nThe plaintiffs now claim that upon moving to Pennsylvania,\nRadnor should have placed Michael at the Hill Top School\nrather than at Radnor High. However, his father never\nreached any agreement with Radnor or with other\nPennsylvania educational authorities that Michael should\nbe placed in a segregated, private school. Therefore,\nMichael had no \"then-current educational placement\" in the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the stay-put provision\nprovides no relief for him.\n\nWe hold that the IDEA's overall scheme and the\nprecedent interpreting that scheme leads inexorably to the\nconclusion that when a student moves from State A to\nState B, any prior IEP in effect in State A need not be\ntreated by State B as continuing automatically in effect.\nThis interpretation of the inapplicability of the stay-put\nprovision may, as plaintiffs claim, lead to the initial result\nthat \"disabled students like Michael with comprehensive\nand long-standing IEP's . . . can be forced upon an\ninterstate move to somehow cope in regular education\nwithout supports while the district and the parent resolve\nany IEP dispute.\" (Appellant's Br. at 14 (emphasis in\noriginal)). But if parents believe that private school\nplacement remains the only way to provide the student with\nthe educational benefit required by the IDEA, or otherwise\ndisagree with an IEP proposal, they can place the child in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We note that this scenario is distinguishable from the situation in\nwhich a parent unilaterally removes a child previously determined to be\ndisabled from one school district and moves the child to another school\ndistrict in the same state. In the latter situation, the child's\neducational\nplacement has already been determined in accordance with state\nprocedures and with the consent of the child's parents, and his or her\nIEP bears the imprimatur of that state. See Inquiry of Rieser, OSEP\nPolicy Letter, July 17, 1986 (U.S. Dep't Educ. 1986).\n\n                               13\n\fa private school, initiate a due process hearing, and seek\nreimbursement from educational authorities later. 8 See\nFlorence County Sch.

The plaintiffs' contention\nthat these parents would have to keep paying private school\ntuition out of pocket for \"years\" is meritless, as federal and\nstate regulations impose strict timing requirements on the\ncompletion of evaluations, the development and\nimplementation of IEPs, and review of challenges to a local\neducational authority's proposal or refusal to initiate or\nchange the identification, evaluation, or educational\nplacement of a child or the provision of FAPE to a child. See\n34 C.F.R. SS 300.504(a), 300.512; 22 Pa. CodeSS 14.25(m),\n342.25(p) (timeline for completion of multidisciplinary\nevaluations); 22 Pa. Code. S 14.32(i) (timeline for\npreparation and implementation of IEPs); 22 Pa. Code\nSS 14.63, 14.64(o) (timelines for requesting and holding\nprehearing conference or due process hearing). We are\nmindful that this interpretation may bind the hands of\nparents who cannot afford to pay private school tuition out-\nof-pocket and await future reimbursement. This same\nresult, however, can occur where parents of a student who\ntransfers intrastate disagree with the new school district's\nplacement of their child, and appears to be an unfortunate\nreality of the system Congress created.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the interpretation adopted by\nOSEP in Policy Memorandum 96-5 is a reasonable\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Because Pennsylvania never established an IEP for Michael, it is not\ncertain that Radnor's interim educational plan for Michael was\ninappropriate. The administrative hearing officer concluded that the\ninterim options proposed by Radnor would have closely approximated\nthe placement Michael received at the LAB School. The district court\nfound that this conclusion was supported by substantial evidence on the\nrecord as a whole (Op. at 8 n.10), and plaintiffs have not appealed this\ndetermination.\n\n                               14\n\faccommodation of the stay-put provision and the overriding\npurposes and structure of the IDEA, and we are persuaded\nthat this interpretation deserves deference.9\n\n       2.

We note that an additional reason for adopting OSEP's interpretation\nof the stay-put provision, not asserted by the parties, may lie in the\nlimited congressional authority under which the provision was originally\nenacted. The stay-put provision dates back to 1975, when it was enacted\nas section 615(e)(3) of the IDEA's predecessor statute, the Education for\nAll Handicapped Children Act. See Pub. L. No. 94-142, 1975\nU.S.C.C.A.N. (89 Stat.) 773, 789. Congressional authority for passage of\nthis statute derived from its spending power, U.S. Const. art. I, S 8, and\nthat act functioned by conditioning state and local educational\nauthorities' eligibility for federal funds upon their satisfaction of\ncertain\nconditions favorable to education of disabled students. See Board of\nEduc. of the Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v.

Nevertheless, after the 1997\namendments, the stay-put provision remained substantially identical to\nits previous text, was placed in \"Part B\" (subchapter II) of the amended\nstatute, which is entitled \"Assistance for Education of All Children with\nDisabilities,\" Pub L.

The plaintiffs\nargue that a Pennsylvania regulation imposes a more\nstringent pendency requirement than that imposed by IDEA\nitself or by DOE regulations. The regulation in question\nstates:\n\n       No change in the identification, evaluation, educational\n       placement or IEP of an exceptional student or an\n       eligible young child may be made during the pendency\n       of an administrative or judicial proceeding unless\n       agreed upon by the parties to the proceeding.\n\n22 Pa. Code S 14.61(b).\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that this regulation's prohibition\non changes in a child's \"identification, evaluation,\neducational placement, or IEP\" is broader than the federal\nprohibition on changes in a child's \"then-current\neducational placement,\" and that this broader sweep\nincludes evaluations and IEP's from other states. One\nfederal district court has noted in dictum that the\nPennsylvania regulation is \"much more prohibitive than its\nfederal counterpart\" in that S 14.64(b) prohibits re-\nevaluation during the pendency of proceedings, whereas the\nfederal stay-put provision only prohibits a change in\neducational placement.

We believe the district\ncourt was right to do so for two reasons. First,\nPennsylvania regulations contain a provision expressly\nrequiring that:\n\n                               16\n\f       If an exceptional student moves from one school\n       district in this Commonwealth to another, the new\n       district shall implement the existing IEP to the extent\n       possible or shall provide the services and programs\n       specified in an interim IEP agreed to by the parents\n       until a new IEP is developed and implemented in\n       accordance with this [and other] sections[ ] . . . and\n       until the completion of due process proceedings . . . .\n\n22 Pa. Code. S 14.31(c). The existence of this specific\nregulatory provision is significant because a parallel\nprovision dealing with students who move from another\nstate to a school district in Pennsylvania, and who had\npreviously been educated in accordance with an IEP\ndeveloped in that other state, is conspicuously absent from\nthese regulations. This absence evidences a lack of intent\non the part of Pennsylvania regulators to address Michael's\nsituation.\n\nSecond, the Pennsylvania appeals panel, the highest\nadministrative authority of the Commonwealth to opine in\nthis case, concluded that because the federal pendency\nprovision did not apply, once plaintiffs rejected Radnor's\ninterim IEP offer, \"Michael was considered a regular\neducation student.\" (A.119a). Presumably, had this state\nadministrative panel construed Pennsylvania regulations to\nmandate implementation of the Washington IEP, it would\nhave so held in its analysis.10\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Pennsylvania regulations do\nnot require a Pennsylvania school district such as Radnor\nto implement the IEP formulated in another state.\n\n       3. \"Proceedings\"\n\nIn addition, even if we did interpret the IDEA's stay-put\nprovision to require a state to implement an IEP developed\nby another state, this provision is not applicable in this\ncase because by its terms, it applies only to attempts to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. In addition, the local hearing officer directly rejected plaintiffs'\nargument, finding that Pennsylvania's regulations are merely\n\"clarifications of how to implement the federal IDEA requirements within\nPennsylvania.\" (A.127a-28a).\n\n                                17\n\falter a student's current educational placement \"during the\npendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this\nsection.\" 20 U.S.C. S 1415(j) (emphasis added). (See Radnor\nBr. at 9; PDE Br. at 14). Radnor and PDE contend that the\nearliest proceeding that can be conducted pursuant to\nsection 1415 is a due process hearing (conducted pursuant\nto section 1415(f)), and that since Michael had already\nmoved to New Jersey when he requested a due process\nhearing, no proceeding \"conducted pursuant to\" section\n1415 was pending at the time he resided in Radnor\nTownship.\n\nThe district court rejected this argument, holding that\nproceedings under section 1415 included \"the opportunity\nof the parent or guardian to inspect relevant records with\nrespect to the child's evaluation, and the notice\nrequirement the school district must satisfy when making\nthe initial placement decision,\" both of which had begun\nwhile Michael lived in Radnor Township. (Op. at 4 n.4). The\ndistrict court characterized these as \"proceedings set forth\nin S 1415(b),\" and noted that both \"are part of the process\nby which a school district changes a student's placement,\nbut by definition occur before the start of a due process\nhearing.\"\n\nIn this respect, the district court was mistaken. The types\nof proceedings dealt with in section 1415(b), which include\nthe conduct and development of evaluations, eligibility\ndeterminations, IEPs, and educational placement, arise\nunder section 1414. Section 1415(b) merely sets forth\n\"procedures\" to be observed during these \"proceedings.\"\nTherefore, no proceedings conducted pursuant to section\n1415 were pending during the time Radnor offered to place\nMichael in Radnor High and his father instead placed him\nat Hill Top.11 See Verhoeven v.

They base this assertion on the testimony of Radnor's\nDirector of Special Education that, had Michael been a\nPennsylvania resident who merely moved from another\nPennsylvania school district to Radnor, an IEP calling for\nprivate placement would have been honored. (A.154a).\n\nAdoption of the policy enunciated in OSEP Policy\nMemorandum 96-5, however, does not cause Michael to be\ntreated differently from other Pennsylvania residents. Every\nstudent in Pennsylvania identified as disabled is entitled to\nan evaluation, an IEP, and if warranted, a special\nplacement, in accordance with Pennsylvania procedures.\nHad Michael been a Pennsylvania resident transferring to\nRadnor from another Pennsylvania district, where he had\nalready been identified as disabled and was being educated\nin accordance with an IEP developed there, he would have\nalready submitted to these procedures. The District\nDirector of Special Education's testimony that Radnor\nwould have honored an IEP developed under such\ncircumstances flows logically from this view and in no way\naffects plaintiffs' right to travel interstate.\n\nMichael transferred from Washington, and had not yet\nundergone an evaluation in accordance with Pennsylvania\nprocedures, as every other disabled student enrolled in\nPennsylvania had. Therefore, in requiring that a new IEP be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npresented for our review. Accordingly, we discuss the plaintiffs' S 1983\nclaim as against Radnor only. Moreover, we do not address PDE's\nadditional argument that Michael has not adequately alleged that any\nPDE official was involved in the decision not to honor his Washington,\nD.C. IEP.\n\n                               20\n\fdeveloped, Radnor's treatment of Michael was not\ninconsistent with its treatment of Pennsylvania residents.\nIndeed, only by submitting to these procedures could\nPennsylvania determine if Michael even had a right (under\nthe IDEA) to a private placement. Pennsylvania decided\nthat, at least on an interim basis, Michael had no such\nright, and his educational needs could instead be met in a\nstructured public school placement. We need not pass on\nthe merits of that decision. See supra note 8.\n\nArguably, requiring a disabled student who has\nundergone evaluation and IEP development in a different\nstate to submit to this process a second time upon moving\nto a new state possibly may deter the student and his\nfamily from moving to the new state. However, an otherwise\nconstitutional law that incidentally discourages migration is\nnot necessarily rendered suspect or invalid merely because\nof such incidental effect. See Lawrence H. Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law S 15-14, at 1381 (2d ed. 1988).\n\nMichael has a right, established by the IDEA and defined\nby state law, to a free, appropriate public education.\nRadnor has done nothing to alter or deny Michael that\nright. It has not imposed different standards on the type of\neducation Michael may receive versus the type of education\na disabled student who moves from one school district to\nanother within Pennsylvania may receive. Thus, Michael\ncannot claim that Radnor's action in this case violated his\nright to travel under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, and consequently, cannot claim a\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. S 1983.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants and\ndenying summary judgment for the plaintiffs will be\naffirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                21\n\f</pre>",
