(\"defendants\"), arguing that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to admit evidence in support of a failure to rehire claim.\n\nDefendants      cross-appeal    from    the    district      court's   award     of\n\nattorney's fees to plaintiffs.1          After careful review, we affirm\n\nboth the judgment and the attorney's fees award.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            Prior to the events at issue in these appeals, plaintiffs\n\nwere employees of Gurabo, holding irregular appointments for fixed\n\nperiods.        During the course of their employment, plaintiffs'\n\ncontracts had generally been renewed by Gurabo on a continual and\n\nuninterrupted basis.        All were affiliated with the New Progressive\n\nParty   (\"NPP\").       On   January    19,    2001,    following   a   change    of\n\nadministration brought about by the Popular Democratic Party's\n\n(\"PDP\") victory in the November 7, 2000, general elections, Gurabo\n\nterminated plaintiffs' contracts, which would have expired on\n\nJune 30, 2001, without a prior hearing.               Defendants explained the\n\nterminations as a product of budgetary and fiscal considerations.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Plaintiffs also appealed the award of attorney's fees but have\nsubsequently requested that the appeal be voluntarily dismissed.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fPlaintiffs        allege     that        the   terminations      were     motivated     by\n\ndiscriminatory animus on account of their political affiliation.\n\n          Following plaintiffs' terminations, new positions became\n\navailable at Gurabo financed with funds available due to the\n\napproval, on February 14, 2001, of a proposal submitted by Gurabo\n\nunder 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 711c (\"Law 52\"), \"a vehicle through which\n\nthe   Commonwealth          subsidize[s]             locally   managed    programs      to\n\nameliorate unemployment.\" Gómez v. Rivera Rodríguez, 344 F.3d 103,\n\n107 (1st Cir. 2003).2             None of plaintiffs was hired to the Law 52\n\npositions.\n\n             On    April     2,     2001,      plaintiffs      filed    this     political\n\ndiscrimination suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of\n\ntheir First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.                           During pre-trial\n\nproceedings,       on      June     6,     2002,      the   district     court     granted\n\nplaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment due process claim, holding that plaintiffs' continued\n\nexpectation of employment until June 30, 2001 was terminated\n\nwithout due process of law in violation of Cleveland Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985).\n\n          On January 16, 2002, plaintiffs submitted a proposed pre-\n\ntrial order, which included the following:\n\n\n2\n   A detailed account of the Law 52 hirings can be found in Gómez,\n344 F.3d at 107-08, which reviews district court proceedings in a\npolitical discrimination suit brought by another set of plaintiffs,\npreviously employed by Gurabo on the basis of Law 52 funding, who\nwere terminated on January 30, 2001.\n\n                                               -3-\n\f          The Irregular Plaintiffs claim that the\n          financial reason advanced on the Irregular\n          Plaintiffs' termination letter is a mere\n          pretext to conceal the true motive behind\n          their dismissal; i.e., a political affiliation\n          which is different from defendants' one.\n          Defendants, however, played their politically\n          discriminatory chips shrewdly, and did not\n          hire    replacements    for   the    Irregular\n          Plaintiffs; instead, the functions formerly\n          performed by the Irregular Plaintiffs are now\n          carry-out by newly hired employees affiliated\n          to the P.D.P., who were hired on other\n          employment   bases,  such   as   Law   52,  or\n          transitory contract employments.\n\nOn November 21, 2002, the district court issued an order excluding\n\nevidence of the Law 52 hirings.   On November 27, the district court\n\nvacated the order and ruled to permit the introduction of the Law\n\n52 hirings at trial, on the following basis:\n\n          Upon further consideration and analysis, the\n          Court has reconsidered its previous ruling,\n          and shall permit the introduction of such\n          evidence at trial.    The Court is convinced\n          that plaintiffs are entitled to have a jury\n          (or judge) determine at trial whether their\n          layoffs were pretextual, as well as whether\n          these were intended to subsequently hire\n          individuals of different political affiliation\n          (pursuant to Law 52) who sympathized with the\n          new municipal administration.\n\nDefendants moved for reconsideration, and during a hearing on\n\nDecember 3, 2002, the court denied the motion, stating:\n\n                 I heard arguments. My ruling is that I\n          will allow this evidence as evidence of\n          pretext.\n                 Obviously it's not a second cause of\n          action, and obviously, damages issues that go\n          to the jury will go. But it's not a separate\n          cause of action as to the failure to rehire.\n          I am allowing it as evidence of pretext.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fDuring trial, the jury was instructed thus:\n\n                  Now, this First Amendment claim which\n           you have before you, this is not a case about\n           failure to rehire. It's a case for dismissal\n           based on political discrimination; however,\n           you may consider evidence of failure to rehire\n           as evidence of pretext or of no pretext for\n           the dismissal.\n\n                  You are to determine whether that\n           failure to rehire was a pretext or not based\n           on the overall evidence and the facts.     But\n           this is not a case about failure to rehire.\n           This is a case about whether the plaintiffs on\n           January 19, 2001, were dismissed based on\n           political discrimination.\n\nOn December 23, 2002, the jury returned a verdict in favor of\n\ndefendants on the First Amendment claim and awarded no compensatory\n\ndamages to plaintiffs as to their successful Fourteenth Amendment\n\nclaim. On January 8, 2003, the district court entered judgment for\n\ndefendants on the First Amendment claim and awarded nominal damages\n\nin the amount of one dollar per plaintiff for the due process\n\nviolation.\n\n             On March 14, 2003, the district court entered an order\n\nawarding     plaintiffs   attorney's    fees   under   the   Civil   Rights\n\nAttorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (\"Fees Act\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1988,\n\nin connection with the due process claim.          The court reduced the\n\nfees by 33% \"since the plaintiffs obtained limited claims-based\n\nsuccess    and    relief.\"      Both     parties    filed    motions   for\n\nreconsideration of the attorney's fees order.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           While   the   attorney's      fees   motions   remained   pending,\n\nplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the judgment, arguing that\n\nthe district court erroneously limited the scope and use at trial\n\nof the evidence regarding defendants' failure to hire plaintiffs to\n\nthe Law 52 positions.      On April 30, 2003, the district court ruled\n\non plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the attorney's fees\n\naward and increased the hourly rates, again \"reduc[ing] the total\n\nfee award by 33% since plaintiffs obtained limited claims based\n\nsuccess and relief.\"      Defendants appeal this order.\n\n                               II. Analysis\n\nA.   Evidence of Law 52 hirings\n\n           We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for\n\nabuse of discretion.      Cummings v. Standard Register Co., 265 F.3d\n\n56, 62 (1st Cir. 2001)(citing Sheek v. Asia Badger, Inc., 235 F.3d\n\n687, 695 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n           Plaintiffs     argue   that    the   district   court     erred   in\n\nadmitting evidence regarding the Law 52 hirings only as evidence of\n\npretext, thus precluding its use to support an independent failure\n\nto rehire cause of action.        Plaintiffs contend that evidence that\n\nnone of plaintiffs was hired to the Law 52 positions supports a\n\nfailure to rehire claim under Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,\n\n497 U.S. 62 (1990).      While conceding that their original complaint\n\ndid not include and was never amended to include a failure to\n\nrehire claim, plaintiffs assert that the failure to rehire cause of\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\faction was referred to in the pretrial memorandum of January 16,\n\n2002, amended in November 2002, which was adopted by the trial\n\ncourt in its pretrial order, and thus that evidence of the Law 52\n\nhirings should have been allowed in support of a failure to rehire\n\ncause of action.   Plaintiffs base this argument on the principle\n\nthat \"[p]retrial statements are to be liberally construed to cover\n\nany of the legal or factual theories that might be embraced by\n\ntheir language.\"   Rodrigues v. Ripley Indus., Inc., 507 F.2d 782,\n\n787 (1st Cir. 1974)(citing Wright & Miller, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure § 1527 at 609 & n. 47 (1971)).\n\n          Defendants argue that their due process rights are in\n\njeopardy, as plaintiffs never amended the complaint and defendants\n\nwere therefore denied notice and were not provided an opportunity\n\nto submit a responsive pleading regarding the failure to rehire\n\nclaim until days before trial. Although plaintiffs referred to the\n\nLaw 52 hirings in pretrial memoranda in relation to the question of\n\npretext, defendants contend that this did not amount to sufficient\n\nnotice of plaintiffs' intent to include a new cause of action and\n\ninstead appeared as an isolated statement in relation to the\n\npretext aspect of their discriminatory discharge claim, and thus\n\nthe district   court   did   not   abuse   its    discretion    in   allowing\n\nevidence of the Law 52 hirings only as to pretext.             We agree.\n\n          Plaintiffs   had    ample   time   to    move   to    amend   their\n\npleadings under Rule 15 to include a failure to rehire cause of\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\faction.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).           They chose not to do so.         They\n\ncontend that their reading of Rodrigues led them to believe that\n\nsuch an amendment was unnecessary and yet they do not, and cannot,\n\nprovide any authority for the proposition that pretrial statements\n\ncan   routinely   be    used   to   augment     the   claims   pleaded   in    the\n\ncomplaint.    In Rodrigues itself, this court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's exclusion of evidence because \"we cannot hold that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in ruling that plaintiff's\n\nmurky pretrial statement did not in the circumstances fairly\n\napprise [the defendant] of the [new claim].\"                Rodrigues, 507 F.2d\n\nat 787.      The same is true here.             A \"fleeting mention\" of an\n\nunpleaded    claim     in   pretrial    documents      is    \"not   sufficiently\n\ninformative to satisfy the 'short and plain statement' requirement\n\nof Rule 8(a)(2).\" Rodríguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168,\n\n1172 (1st Cir. 1995).          \"At a bare minimum, even in this age of\n\nnotice pleading, a defendant must be afforded both adequate notice\n\nof any claims asserted against him and a meaningful opportunity to\n\nmount a defense.\"       Id.    We need not address defendants' arguments\n\ncalling into question the merits of plaintiffs' failure to rehire\n\nclaim, then, because we, yet again, \"cannot hold that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in ruling that the plaintiff's murky\n\npretrial statement did not in the circumstances fairly apprise\n\n[defendants] of the [failure to rehire] claim.\"                 Rodrigues, 507\n\nF.2d at 787.      The district court acted within its discretion in\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fadmitting evidence of the Law 52 hirings only as to the question of\n\npretext.\n\nB.   Attorney's fees\n\n           Attorney's fees awards are reviewed for manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion, and \"a reviewing court customarily defers to the trial\n\njudge, whose intimate knowledge of the nuances of the underlying\n\ncase uniquely positions him to construct a condign award.\"        Gay\n\nOfficers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)(citations omitted).       \"We therefore confine our review to\n\nwhether the district court has made a mistake of law or incorrectly\n\nweighed (or failed to weigh) a factor in its decision.\" Richardson\n\nv. Miller, 279 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002)(citation omitted).       In\n\nsum, \"[t]he trial court's discretion in respect to fee awards is\n\nextremely broad.\"      Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n           Defendants contend that plaintiffs are not entitled to\n\nattorney's fees, despite the success of their due process claim, in\n\nlight of the subsequent judgment dismissing their First Amendment\n\nclaims and awarding only nominal damages for the due process\n\nviolation. Defendants argue alternatively that, even if plaintiffs\n\nare entitled to attorney's fees, the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding fees for attorney efforts beyond those\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\finvolved in obtaining summary judgment as to the due process\n\nclaim.3\n\n          Defendants are correct that a favorable judgment on the\n\ndue process claim does not lead inexorably to attorney's fees for\n\nplaintiffs.   The Fees Act provides only that in specified civil\n\nrights litigation \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the\n\nprevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable\n\nattorney's fee as part of the costs.\"       42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).\n\nNevertheless, \"[a]lthough this fee-shifting provision is couched in\n\npermissive terminology, awards in favor of prevailing civil rights\n\nplaintiffs are virtually obligatory.\"   Gay Officers, 247 F.3d at\n\n293 (citations omitted).    The first question, then, is whether\n\nplaintiffs were properly deemed prevailing parties under the Fees\n\nAct based on the success of their due process claim.\n\n          It is indisputable that the failure of plaintiffs' First\n\nAmendment claims does not preclude the award of attorney's fees for\n\nthe success of the due process claim.      The Supreme Court has\n\nemphasized that \"the plaintiff's success in relation to the other\n\ngoals of the lawsuit is a factor critical to the determination of\n\nthe size of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at\n\nall.\" Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489\n\nU.S. 782, 790 (1989)(emphasis added).      \"Since the plaintiffs'\n\n\n\n3\n  Defendants do not dispute the hourly rates adopted by the trial\ncourt.\n\n                               -10-\n\feffort [to vindicate their due process rights] constituted a\n\ndiscrete claim within a larger case, our focus must not be on who\n\nwon more claims, but on how the parties fared with respect to the\n\n[due process] claim.\"      Gay Officers, 247 F.3d at 294 (citations\n\nomitted).     With respect to the due process claim, plaintiffs\n\nunquestionably prevailed.        The district court's declaration that\n\nGurabo's    actions   violated   the   Constitution   benefits   both   the\n\nplaintiffs and the public, and plaintiffs were thus prevailing\n\nparties under § 1988, though awarded only nominal damages.         Id. at\n\n295.   The Supreme Court has explicitly held that \"a plaintiff who\n\nwins nominal damages is a prevailing party under § 1988.\"          Farrar\n\nv. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 112 (1992).        The district court did not err\n\nin determining that Gurabo's violation of plaintiffs' due process\n\nrights \"settled a significant issue whose resolution benefitted the\n\nplaintiffs and the public,\" Gay Officers, 247 F.3d at 295, nor in\n\nidentifying plaintiffs as prevailing parties on that basis.\n\n            Nevertheless, defendants point to the Farrar Court's\n\nsuggestion that a plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but\n\nreceives no more than nominal damages is often a prevailing party\n\nwho should receive no attorney's fees at all.         Farrar, 506 U.S. at\n\n115 (\"In a civil rights suit for damages . . . the awarding of\n\nnominal damages . . . highlights the plaintiff's failure to prove\n\nactual, compensable injury . . . .\").           In Farrar, however, the\n\nplaintiff achieved only a de minimis victory in relation to each of\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f\"the relevant indicia of success -- the extent of relief, the\n\nsignificance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed,\n\nand the public purposes served.\"                 Id. at 122 (O'Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring). Here, although plaintiffs' victory was de minimis as\n\nto the extent of relief, the district court appropriately exercised\n\nits discretion      to   award     fees,    as   the   determination   that   the\n\nmunicipality violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights represented\n\na significant legal conclusion serving an important public purpose.\n\nIn such circumstances, the Supreme Court has explicitly \"reject[ed]\n\nthe proposition that fee awards under § 1988 should necessarily be\n\nproportionate to the amount of damages a civil rights plaintiff\n\nactually recovers.\" City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 574\n\n(1986).\n\n            Defendants argue in the alternative that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that a reasonable fee\n\naward     could   include    the    total    hours     worked   by   plaintiffs'\n\nattorneys, including their preparation for and participation in the\n\ntrial, reduced by one third to reflect the partial nature of\n\nplaintiffs' success.        Defendants argue that an award of attorney's\n\nfees for any efforts expended after the partial summary judgment in\n\nfavor of plaintiffs constitutes an abuse of discretion, since none\n\nof these efforts bore fruit -- plaintiffs' First Amendment claims\n\nfailed and the jury awarded no compensatory damages in relation to\n\nthe due process violation.            Thus, defendants argue, plaintiffs\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fcannot be deemed to have \"prevailed\" as to any claims pursued\n\nbeyond the pretrial summary judgment in their favor.              As noted\n\nabove, however, the district court's award of nominal damages after\n\ntrial does indeed alter the legal relationship between the parties\n\nin such a way as to justify an award of attorney's fees.           Farrar,\n\n506 U.S. at 574.\n\n            A plaintiff may demand payment for nominal\n            damages no less than he may demand payment for\n            millions of dollars in compensatory damages.\n            A judgment for damages in any amount, whether\n            compensatory   or   nominal,    modifies   the\n            defendant's behavior for the plaintiff's\n            benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an\n            amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\n\nId. at 574.      The Farrar Court thus concluded that \"[o]nce civil\n\nrights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between\n\nthe parties, 'the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to\n\nthe reasonableness' of a fee award under Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n\nU.S. 424 (1983).\"    Id.    We thus turn to the question of whether the\n\nattorney's fees awarded by the district court were reasonable in\n\nlight of the partial nature of the plaintiffs' success.\n\n            In   Hensley,   the   Supreme   Court   emphasized   that   \"the\n\ndistrict court has discretion in determining the amount of a fee\n\naward.      This is appropriate in view of the district court's\n\nsuperior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of\n\navoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual\n\nmatters.\"    461 U.S. at 437.       This court has reiterated that the\n\ndistrict court \"is vested with wide discretion and brings to bear\n\n                                    -13-\n\fan ability to weigh against the total background the significance\n\nof any contributions and the appropriateness of any award of fees\n\nand   costs.\"       United   States    v.     Comunidades   Unidas    Contra   la\n\nContaminación, 204 F.3d 275, 283 (1st Cir. 2000). When a plaintiff\n\nis successful on some claims, but not others, we exhibit the same\n\n\"great deference\" to the trial court's discretion in adjusting the\n\nfees, \"motivated by our conviction that 'the decision as to how to\n\nseparate the wheat from the chaff in a fees contest, within broad\n\nlimits,   is    a   matter   for   the      district   court's   discretion.'\"\n\nLipsett, 975 F.2d at 941 (quoting United States v. Metropolitan\n\nDist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n              As required by Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37, the district\n\ncourt considered the relationship between the extent of success and\n\nthe amount of the fee award and decided that the partial nature of\n\nplaintiffs' success was best reflected by calculating the fees for\n\nthe   total    of   the   attorneys'     efforts    through   trial    and   then\n\n\"reduc[ing] the total fee award by 33% since plaintiffs obtained\n\nlimited claims based success and relief.\"               The district court's\n\nrationale for doing so is indicated by its citation to Andrade v.\n\nJamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179, 1191 (1st Cir. 1996), in which\n\nthis court summarized the Supreme Court's holding in Hensley:\n\n              Hensley makes clear that where multiple claims\n              are interrelated and a plaintiff has achieved\n              only limited success, awarding her the entire\n              lodestar amount would ordinarily be excessive.\n              Hensley, therefore, counsels that, while\n              \"[t]here is no precise rule or formula for\n\n                                       -14-\n\f          making these determinations,\" a court \"may\n          attempt to identify specific hours that should\n          be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the\n          award to account for the limited success.\"\n\nId. at 1991 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436).   The district court\n\nviewed the attorneys' efforts to prove damages at trial as to the\n\nsuccessful due process claim and their efforts regarding the First\n\nAmendment claims as interrelated, and it chose the second of the\n\noptions identified in Hensley for reducing the total award to\n\naccount for the plaintiffs' partial success, simply reducing the\n\ntotal award rather than attempting to identify specific hours to be\n\neliminated.   The district court thus fulfilled its obligations to\n\n\"provide a concise but clear explanation of its reason for the fee\n\naward\" and to \"make clear that it has considered the relationship\n\nbetween the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained.\"\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 437.   The district court found this to be a\n\ncase \"[w]here it would be an 'exercise in futility' to separate out\n\nthe legal services rendered for each claim, [so] the fee should\n\nsimply be determined as a function of degree of success.\" Lipsett,\n\n975 F.2d at 940-41 (quotations and citations omitted).      We have\n\nconfirmed elsewhere, following Supreme Court precedent, that \"when\n\na civil rights suit consists of multiple claims, and when the\n\nplaintiff prevails on some but not on others, the plaintiff is\n\nentitled to fees for hours worked not only on the successful civil\n\nrights claims, but also on other claims involving a 'common core of\n\nfacts' or 'related legal theories.'\"    Aubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d\n\n                               -15-\n\f287, 291 (1st Cir. 1986)(quoting Hensley, 461 U.S at 435).              Here,\n\ndefendants \"have done little to carry their burden of showing that\n\nhours which the district court found to be hopelessly blended were\n\nin fact segregable,\" and the First Amendment claims involved \"a\n\ntightly wrapped core of common facts shared with the claims upon\n\nwhich the plaintiff prevailed -– a circumstance that lends great\n\ncredibility to the district court's decision.\"              Lipsett, 975 F.2d\n\nat 941.    Regardless of whether \"we, if writing on a pristine page,\n\nmight have been more miserly, we are constrained in this instance\n\nto defer to the trial court's determination that the requisite\n\nlinkage was forged.\"        Id. at 941.\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision to admit evidence of the Law 52 hirings only as\n\nevidence    of   pretext.      We    also    affirm   the   district   court's\n\nattorney's fees award.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f",

During the course of their employment, plaintiffs' contracts had generally been renewed by Gurabo on a continual and uninterrupted basis. All were affiliated with the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). On January 19, 2001, following a change of administration brought about by the Popular Democratic Party's (\"PDP\") victory in the November 7, 2000, general elections, Gurabo terminated plaintiffs' contracts, which would have expired on June 30, 2001, without a prior hearing. Defendants explained the terminations as a product of budgetary and fiscal considerations.

During pre-trial proceedings, on June 6, 2002, the district court granted plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the Fourteenth Amendment due process claim, holding that plaintiffs' continued expectation of employment until June 30, 2001 was terminated without due process of law in violation of <i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

Defendants, however, played their politically discriminatory chips shrewdly, and did not hire replacements for the Irregular Plaintiffs; instead, the functions formerly performed by the Irregular Plaintiffs are now carry-out by newly hired employees affiliated to the P.D.P., who were hired on other employment bases, such as Law 52, or transitory contract employments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2002, the district court issued an order excluding evidence of the Law 52 hirings.

The Court is convinced that plaintiffs are entitled to have a jury (or judge) determine at trial whether their layoffs were pretextual, as well as whether these were intended to subsequently hire individuals of different political affiliation (pursuant to Law 52) who sympathized with the new municipal administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved for reconsideration, and during a hearing on December 3, 2002, the court denied the motion, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I heard arguments.

Evidence of Law 52 hirings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>Cummings v. Standard Register Co.,</i> 265 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.2001)(citing <i>Sheek v. Asia Badger, Inc.,</i> 235 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in admitting evidence regarding the Law 52 hirings only as evidence of pretext, thus precluding its use to support an independent failure to rehire cause of action. Plaintiffs contend that evidence that none of the plaintiffs was hired to the Law 52 positions supports a failure to rehire claim under <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990). While conceding that their original complaint did not include and was never amended to include a failure to rehire claim, plaintiffs assert that the failure to rehire cause of action was referred to in the pretrial memorandum of January 16, 2002, amended in November 2002, which was adopted by the trial court in its pretrial order, and thus that evidence of the Law 52 hirings should have been allowed in support of a failure to rehire cause of action. Plaintiffs base this argument on the principle that \"[p]retrial statements are to be liberally construed to cover any of the legal or factual theories that might be embraced by their language.\" <i>Rodrigues v. Ripley Indus., Inc.,</i> 507 F.2d 782, 787 (1st Cir.1974)(citing 6A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 1527 at 609 &amp; n. 47 (1971)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that their due process rights are in jeopardy, as plaintiffs never amended the complaint and defendants were therefore denied notice and were not provided an opportunity to submit a responsive pleading regarding the failure to rehire claim until days before trial. Although plaintiffs referred to the Law 52 hirings in pretrial memoranda in relation to the question of pretext, defendants contend that this did not amount to sufficient notice of plaintiffs' intent to include a new cause of action and instead appeared as an isolated statement in relation to the pretext aspect of their discriminatory discharge claim, and thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of the Law 52 hirings only as to pretext. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs had ample time to move to amend their pleadings under Rule 15 to include a failure to rehire cause of action. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). They chose not to do so. They contend that their reading of <i>Rodrigues</i> led them to believe that such an amendment was unnecessary and yet they do not, and cannot, provide any authority for the proposition that pretrial statements can routinely be used to augment the claims pleaded in the complaint. In <i>Rodrigues</i> itself, this court affirmed the district court's exclusion of evidence because \"we cannot hold that the district court abused its discretion in ruling that plaintiff's murky pretrial statement did not in the circumstances fairly apprise [the defendant] of the [new claim].\" <i>Rodrigues,</i> 507 F.2d at 787. The same is true here. A \"fleeting mention\" of an unpleaded claim in pretrial documents is \"not sufficiently informative to satisfy the `short and plain statement' requirement of Rule 8(a)(2).\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez v. Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1172 (1st Cir.1995). \"At a bare minimum, even in this age of notice pleading, a defendant must be afforded both adequate notice of any claims asserted against him and a meaningful opportunity to mount a defense.\" <i>Id.</i> We need not address defendants' arguments calling into question the merits of plaintiffs' failure to rehire claim, then, because we, yet again, \"cannot hold that the district court abused its discretion in ruling that the plaintiff's murky pretrial statement did not in the circumstances fairly apprise [defendants] of the [failure to rehire] claim.\" <i>Rodrigues,</i> 507 F.2d at 787.

Defendants argue alternatively that, even if plaintiffs are entitled to attorney's fees, the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees for attorney efforts beyond those involved in obtaining summary judgment as to the due process claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants are correct that a favorable judgment on the due process claim does not lead inexorably to attorney's fees for plaintiffs. The Fees Act provides only that in specified civil rights litigation \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988(b). Nevertheless, \"[a]lthough this fee-shifting provision is couched in permissive terminology, awards in favor of prevailing civil rights plaintiffs are virtually obligatory.\" <i>Gay Officers,</i> 247 F.3d at 293 (citations omitted). The first question, then, is whether plaintiffs were properly deemed prevailing parties under the Fees Act based on the success of their due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is indisputable that the failure of plaintiffs' First Amendment claims does not preclude the award of attorney's fees for the success of the due process claim. The Supreme Court has emphasized that \"the plaintiff's success in relation to the other goals of the lawsuit is a factor critical to the determination of the <i>size</i> of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at all.\" <i>Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 489 U.S. 782, 790, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989)(emphasis added). \"Since the plaintiffs' effort [to vindicate their due process rights] constituted a discrete claim within a larger case, our focus must not be on who won more claims, but on how the parties fared with respect to the [due process] claim.\" <i>Gay Officers,</i> 247 F.3d at 294 (citations omitted). With respect to the due process claim, plaintiffs unquestionably prevailed. The district court's declaration that Gurabo's actions violated the Constitution benefits both the plaintiffs and the public, and plaintiffs were thus prevailing parties under &#167; 1988, though awarded only nominal damages. <i>Id.</i> at 295. The Supreme Court has explicitly held that \"a plaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under &#167; 1988.\" <i>Farrar v. Hobby,</i> 506 U.S. 103, 112, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). The district court did not err in determining that Gurabo's violation of plaintiffs' due process rights \"settled a significant issue whose resolution benefitted the plaintiffs and the public,\" <i>Gay Officers,</i> 247 F.3d at 295, nor in identifying plaintiffs as prevailing parties on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, defendants point to the <i>Farrar</i> Court's suggestion that a plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages is often a prevailing party who should receive no attorney's fees at all. <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 115, 113 S.Ct. 566 (\"In a civil rights suit for damages ... the awarding of nominal damages ... highlights the plaintiff's failure to prove actual, compensable injury....\"). In <i>Farrar,</i> however, the plaintiff achieved only a <i>de minimis</i> victory in relation to each of \"the relevant indicia of success &#8212; the extent of relief, the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed, and the public purposes served.\" <i>Id.</i> at 122, 113 S.Ct. 566 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Here, although plaintiffs' victory was <i>de minimis</i> as to the extent of relief, the district court appropriately exercised its discretion to award fees, as the determination that the municipality violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights represented a significant legal conclusion serving an important public purpose. In such circumstances, the Supreme Court has explicitly \"reject[ed] the proposition that fee awards under &#167; 1988 should necessarily be proportionate to the amount of damages a civil rights plaintiff actually recovers.\" <i>City of Riverside v. Rivera,</i> 477 U.S. 561, 574, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue in the alternative that the district court abused its discretion in determining that a reasonable fee award could include the total hours worked by plaintiffs' attorneys, including their preparation for and participation in the trial, reduced by one third to reflect the partial nature of plaintiffs' success. Defendants argue that an award of attorney's fees for any efforts expended after the partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs constitutes an abuse of discretion, since none of these efforts bore fruit &#8212; plaintiffs' First Amendment claims failed and the jury awarded no compensatory damages in relation to the due process violation. Thus, defendants argue, plaintiffs cannot be deemed to have \"prevailed\" as to any claims pursued beyond the pretrial summary judgment in their favor. As noted above, however, the district court's award of nominal damages after trial does indeed alter the legal relationship between the parties in such a way as to justify an award of attorney's fees. <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 113, 113 S.Ct. at 573.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff may demand payment for nominal damages no less than he may demand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory damages. A judgment for damages in any amount, whether compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant's behavior for the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 111, 113 S.Ct. 566. The <i>Farrar</i> Court thus concluded that \"[o]nce civil rights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between the parties, `the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness' of a fee award under <i>Hensley v. Eckerhart,</i> 461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).\" <i>Id.</i> We thus turn to the question of whether the attorney's fees awarded by the district court were reasonable in light of the partial nature of the plaintiffs' success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Hensley,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized that \"the district court has discretion in determining the amount of a fee award. This is appropriate in view of the district court's superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\" 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933. This court has reiterated that the district court \"is vested with wide discretion and brings to bear an ability to weigh against the total background the significance of any contributions and the appropriateness of any award of fees and costs.\" <i>United States v. Comunidades Unidas Contra la Contaminacion,</i> 204 F.3d 275, 283 (1st Cir.2000). When a plaintiff is successful on some claims, but not others, we exhibit the same \"great deference\" to the trial court's discretion in adjusting the fees, \"motivated by our conviction that `the decision as to how to separate the wheat from the chaff in a fees contest, within broad limits, is a matter for the district court's discretion.'\" <i>Lipsett,</i> 975 F.2d at 941 (quoting <i>United States v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n,</i> 847 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1988)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by <i>Hensley,</i> 461 U.S. at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933, the district court considered the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award and decided that the partial nature of plaintiffs' success was best reflected by calculating the fees for the total of the attorneys' efforts through trial and then \"reduc[ing] the total fee award by 33% since plaintiffs obtained limited claims based success and relief.\" The district court's rationale for doing so is indicated by its citation to <i>Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth.,</i> 82 F.3d 1179, 1191 (1st Cir.1996), in which this court summarized the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Hensley:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hensley</i> makes clear that where multiple claims are interrelated and a plaintiff has achieved only limited success, awarding her the entire lodestar amount would ordinarily be excessive. <i>Hensley,</i> therefore, counsels that, while \"[t]here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations,\" a court \"may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1991 (quoting <i>Hensley,</i> 461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933). The district court viewed the attorneys' efforts to prove damages at trial as to the successful due process claim and their efforts regarding the First Amendment claims as interrelated, and it chose the second of the options identified in <i>Hensley</i> for reducing the total award to account for the plaintiffs' partial success, simply reducing the total award rather than attempting to identify specific hours to be eliminated. The district court thus fulfilled its obligations to \"provide a concise but clear explanation of its reason for the fee award\" and to \"make clear that it has considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained.\" <i>Hensley,</i> 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933. The district court found this to be a case \"[w]here it would be an `exercise in futility' to separate out the legal services rendered for each claim, [so] the fee should simply be determined as a function of degree of success.\" <i>Lipsett,</i> 975 F.2d at 940-41 (quotations and citations omitted). We have confirmed elsewhere, following Supreme Court precedent, that \"when a civil rights suit consists of multiple claims, and when the plaintiff prevails on some but not on others, the plaintiff is entitled to fees for hours worked not only on the successful civil rights claims, but also on other claims involving a `common core of facts' or `related legal theories.'\" <i>Aubin v. Fudala,</i> 782 F.2d 287, 291 (1st Cir.1986)(quoting <i>Hensley,</i> 461 U.S at 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933). Here, defendants \"have done little to carry their burden of showing that hours which the district court found to be hopelessly blended were in fact segregable,\" and the First Amendment claims involved \"a tightly wrapped core of common facts shared with the claims upon which the plaintiff prevailed &#8212; a circumstance that lends great credibility to the district court's decision.\" <i>Lipsett,</i> 975 F.2d at 941. Regardless of whether \"we, if writing on a pristine page, might have been more miserly, we are constrained in this instance to defer to the trial court's determination that the requisite linkage was forged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 941.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's decision to admit evidence of the Law 52 hirings only as evidence of pretext.

On January 19, 2001, following a change of administration brought about by the Popular Democratic Party's (\"PDP\") victory in the November 7, 2000, general elections, Gurabo terminated plaintiffs' contracts, which would have expired on June 30, 2001, without a prior hearing.

The district court did not err in determining that Gurabo's violation of plaintiffs' due process rights \"settled a significant issue whose resolution benefitted the plaintiffs and the public,\" <i>Gay Officers,</i> 247 F.3d at 295, nor in identifying plaintiffs as prevailing parties on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, defendants point to the <i>Farrar</i> Court's suggestion that a plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages is often a prevailing party who should receive no attorney's fees at all. <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, although plaintiffs' victory was <i>de minimis</i> as to the extent of relief, the district court appropriately exercised its discretion to award fees, as the determination that the municipality violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights represented a significant legal conclusion serving an important public purpose.

Defendants argue that an award of attorney's fees for any efforts expended after the partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs constitutes an abuse of discretion, since none of these efforts bore fruit &#8212; plaintiffs' First Amendment claims failed and the jury awarded no compensatory damages in relation to the due process violation. Thus, defendants argue, plaintiffs cannot be deemed to have \"prevailed\" as to any claims pursued beyond the pretrial summary judgment in their favor. As noted above, however, the district court's award of nominal damages after trial does indeed alter the legal relationship between the parties in such a way as to justify an award of attorney's fees. <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 113, 113 S.Ct. at 573.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff may demand payment for nominal damages no less than he may demand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory damages.

When a plaintiff is successful on some claims, but not others, we exhibit the same \"great deference\" to the trial court's discretion in adjusting the fees, \"motivated by our conviction that `the decision as to how to separate the wheat from the chaff in a fees contest, within broad limits, is a matter for the district court's discretion.'\" <i>Lipsett,</i> 975 F.2d at 941 (quoting <i>United States v.

The district court viewed the attorneys' efforts to prove damages at trial as to the successful due process claim and their efforts regarding the First Amendment claims as interrelated, and it chose the second of the options identified in <i>Hensley</i> for reducing the total award to account for the plaintiffs' partial success, simply reducing the total award rather than attempting to identify specific hours to be eliminated. The district court thus fulfilled its obligations to \"provide a concise but clear explanation of its reason for the fee award\" and to \"make clear that it has considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained.\" <i>Hensley,</i> 461 U.S. at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have confirmed elsewhere, following Supreme Court precedent, that \"when a civil rights suit consists of multiple claims, and when the plaintiff prevails on some but not on others, the plaintiff is entitled to fees for hours worked not only on the successful civil rights claims, but also on other claims involving a `common core of facts' or `related legal theories.'\" <i>Aubin v.
