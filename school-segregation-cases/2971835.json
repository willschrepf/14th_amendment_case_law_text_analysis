SADEN, Appellant\n                                       V.\n                           BRIAN SMITH, Appellee\n\n\n\n                   On Appeal from the 270th District Court\n                            Harris County, Texas\n                      Trial Court Case No. 2009-00593\n\n\n\n                                 OPINION\n\n      Charles R. Saden and Brian Smith were the sole shareholders of POS Card\n\nProcessing, Inc. Saden appeals from a judgment against him for breach of contract\n\nand breach of fiduciary duty arising from actions taken in connection with his\n\fmanagement of the company. Smith moved to dismiss this appeal for want of\n\njurisdiction, while Saden raised four appellate issues, alleging: (1) Smith lacked\n\nstanding to recover damages for injuries to the corporation; (2) the trial court erred\n\nby not requiring Smith to elect a remedy; (3) the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment for breach of fiduciary duty because Saden owed Smith no fiduciary duty\n\nindividually; and (4) the trial court erred in rendering judgment on claims not\n\nsubmitted to the jury.\n\n      We conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal. We reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment to the extent that it permitted duplicative recovery of damages\n\nand included additional unauthorized findings, and we remand to the trial court to\n\nallow Smith to elect a remedy and for entry of a new judgment.\n\nI.    Appellate jurisdiction\n\n      After the jury’s verdict but before the trial court entered judgment, Saden\n\ninformed the court that he had filed for bankruptcy and that the automatic\n\nbankruptcy stay applied to all further matters in the case. The bankruptcy court\n\nconverted Saden’s bankruptcy from a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11\n\nto a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7, and it appointed a bankruptcy trustee.\n\nThe bankruptcy court granted Smith’s motion for relief from the automatic stay to\n\ncontinue the state court litigation. The order stated:\n\n            [It is] ORDERED that the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\n      § 362 is modified to permit the continuation of the State Court\n                                           2\n\f      Lawsuit, specifically the automatic stay is modified to allow the state\n      court to enter judgment as to liability and to award damages on of\n      Movant’s claims against the Debtor and the Debtor’s claims against\n      the Movants and allow the parties to prosecute any appeals of the final\n      judgment, provided, however, the automatic stay shall not be modified\n      to allow enforcement of such judgment against the Debtor or pursue\n      any right to collection against the Debtor that may arise out of the\n      State Court Lawsuit . . . .\n\n(Footnote omitted.)\n\n      The trial court then rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict.      On Smith’s\n\nbreach of contract claim, the trial court awarded $941,907, plus prejudgment\n\ninterest and attorney’s fees. For Smith’s breach of fiduciary duty claim the trial\n\ncourt awarded an additional $393,000 in actual damages (plus prejudgment\n\ninterest), as well as $941,907 (plus prejudgment interest) in equitable disgorgement\n\nof the profits “found by the jury to have been obtained by [Saden] as a result of his\n\nacts of fraud, defalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary\n\ncapacity with respect to [Smith].” Saden filed a motion for new trial, a motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a motion to modify, correct, or reform\n\nthe judgment. Saden’s motions were overruled by operation of law, and he timely\n\nfiled a notice of appeal.\n\n      Smith filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,\n\narguing that the bankruptcy trustee had exclusive standing to pursue an appeal of\n\nthe adverse judgment, and because the trustee did not file a notice of appeal, this\n\ncourt lacks appellate jurisdiction.    In response, Saden pointed out that the\n                                         3\n\fbankruptcy court allowed the appeal to proceed by its order that modified the\n\nautomatic stay to allow the trial court to enter judgment and authorized “the parties\n\nto prosecute any appeals of the final judgment.”        Saden also noted that the\n\nbankruptcy court, in the course of declining to discharge the debt, has rejected\n\nSmith’s argument in a “Judgment of Non-Dischargeability,” which provided:\n\n               For the reasons set forth on the record of February 10, 2011,\n        Charles R. Saden’s liability under the judgment of the 270th Judicial\n        District Court of Harris County, Texas in Cause 2009-00593 is\n        excepted from discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523.\n\n              If the state court’s judgment is reversed or modified on appeal,\n        this Court will reconsider this judgment pursuant to Rule 9024 of the\n        Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n\nFinally, Saden argues that he has standing because a state-court judgment cannot\n\nbe collaterally attacked in the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court in this\n\ncase relied on the state-court judgment against him, which recited the trial court’s\n\nfindings that he committed acts of fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement, in\n\nholding that the $3 million judgment underlying this appeal is not dischargeable in\n\nbankruptcy. He argues that a conclusion that the Bankruptcy Code’s automatic\n\nstay terminates his standing to challenge the otherwise unreviewable state-court\n\njudgment that is the basis of the nondischargeability holding is “circular reasoning\n\nand would be a denial of constitutional rights of due process and due course of\n\nlaw.”\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      Meanwhile, after Smith filed his motion to dismiss in this court, Saden filed\n\nin the bankruptcy court an emergency motion to confirm his authority to appeal the\n\nstate-court judgment. The bankruptcy court issued an order which provided:\n\n            The Court cannot, should not and will not determine whether\n      the First Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over Saden’s notice of\n      appeal. That is a matter left solely to the Texas courts.\n\n             The principal case cited by Brian Smith in opposition to the\n      Debtor’s motion is In re Mozer, 302 BR 892 (C.D. Cal. 2003). Mozer\n      indeed deals with a similar situation as the present one—but with a\n      major distinction. The state court findings in Mozer were insufficient\n      to establish an exception to discharge:\n\n            However, sale of the Defensive Appellate Rights by her\n            Trustee is not literally nor is it tantamount to a waiver of\n            dischargeability by the Trustee.           The underlying\n            judgment against Mozer, even if final, is not prima facie\n            non-dischargeable. Mozer has represented to this Court\n            that “additional facts would need to be established and\n            that the debt would not be non-dischargeable even if the\n            state court judgement were to become final.”\n            (Appellants’ Opposition to Shorten Briefing Schedule\n            and Waive Oral Argument, p. 2). To be sure, sale of the\n            Defensive Appellate Rights may be unhelpful to her in\n            defeating a non-dischargeability claim, but she is in no\n            worse position than if she were permitted to pursue the\n            state court appeal and lost.\n\n      Id. (emphasis added).\n\n            In this case, the opposite is alleged and the Court has already\n      determined that the state court judgment bars further litigation over\n      whether the claim is excepted from discharge. Accordingly, to the\n      extent that the automatic stay bars Saden from pursuing his appeal for\n      the purposes of challenging findings that adversely affect his\n      discharge, the stay is modified.\n\n                                         5\n\f             By modifying the stay, this Court expresses no view on whether\n      the First Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over Saden’s appeal.\n\n      Subject-matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a\n\ncase and is never presumed. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852\n\nS.W.2d 440, 443–44 (Tex. 1993); see also Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34\n\nS.W.3d 547, 553–54 (Tex. 2000). Standing is a necessary component of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction and cannot be waived. Blue, 34 S.W.3d at 553–54. If a party\n\nlacks standing, the trial court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case. Id. A\n\nparty has standing only when he raises “an actual, not merely a hypothetical or\n\ngeneralized grievance.” Brown v. Todd, 53 S.W.3d 297, 302 (Tex. 2001); see also\n\nTexas Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 443 (explaining that concept of standing arises\n\nfrom separation of powers and constitutional prohibition on the issuance of\n\nadvisory opinions).\n\n      The filing of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy impacts the issues of\n\nstanding and jurisdiction due to the creation of the bankruptcy estate and the\n\nautomatic stay. When a debtor voluntarily files a petition for bankruptcy, an\n\n“estate” is created, comprised of “all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in\n\nproperty as of the commencement of the case.” 11 U.S.C. § 541 (2012). This\n\nincludes causes of action or legal claims that belonged to the debtor before the\n\npetition was filed. Douglas v. Delp, 987 S.W.2d 879, 882 (Tex. 1999); Hous.\n\nPipeline Co. LP v. Bank of Am., N.A., 213 S.W.3d 418, 424–25 (Tex. App.—\n                                          6\n\fHouston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.); Kane v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 535 F.3d\n\n380, 385 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\n      The filing of a bankruptcy petition further operates as a stay of the\n\n“continuation . . . of a judicial . . . action or proceeding against the debtor that\n\nwas . . . commenced before the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case.” 11\n\nU.S.C. § 362(a)(1). “The automatic stay deprives state courts of jurisdiction over\n\nthe debtor and his property until the stay is lifted or modified.” Hous. Pipeline\n\nCo., 213 S.W.3d at 428–29 (internal quotations omitted).         Thus a judgment\n\nrendered in derogation of the automatic bankruptcy stay is void. York v. State, 373\n\nS.W.3d 32, 38–40 (Tex. 2012) (approving holding in Cont’l Casing Corp. v.\n\nSamedan Oil Corp., 751 S.W.2d 499, 501 (Tex. 1988)).\n\n      Smith moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction based on Saden’s\n\nalleged lack of standing to initiate an appeal after his bankruptcy filing, which\n\nvested exclusive standing in the trustee. In response, Saden argues that he has\n\nstanding because of the bankruptcy court’s non-dischargeability determination and\n\nbecause of the order that modified the automatic bankruptcy stay.          Thus, in\n\ndetermining our jurisdiction, we must ascertain whether (1) Saden has standing to\n\nappeal the state-court judgment and (2) the assumption of jurisdiction would\n\nviolate the automatic stay.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      While discharge in bankruptcy under Chapter 7 extinguishes a debtor’s\n\npersonal liability for a debt, see Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U.S. 78, 82–83\n\n(1991), a “debtor remains personally responsible for any debt not discharged in\n\nbankruptcy.” In re Cousins, 209 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2000). Here, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s judgment of non-dischargeability—applying bankruptcy law to the state-\n\ncourt judgment—means that despite his bankruptcy filing Saden continues to retain\n\na pecuniary interest in the outcome of this case.       He is personally, actually\n\naggrieved by the trial court’s judgment, which affects the scope of the discharge of\n\nhis liabilities in bankruptcy. See Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 302. Accordingly we\n\nconclude that Saden maintains standing to maintain this appeal despite the pending\n\nbankruptcy proceeding.\n\n      We also have subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the appeal in light of the\n\nbankruptcy court’s modification to the automatic stay of bankruptcy to permit the\n\nparties to prosecute any appeals of the final judgment. Thus, our assumption of\n\njurisdiction in this case does not violate the stay. See Hous. Pipeline Co., 213\n\nS.W.3d at 428–29; see also York, 373 S.W.3d at 38–40.            This modification\n\nnecessarily authorized the filing of postjudgment motions necessary to preserve\n\nissues for appellate review under our procedural rules. See, e.g., TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 324(b). Saden’s timely filed post-judgment motions extended the timeline for\n\nfiling his notice of appeal, which was also timely filed.       See TEX. R. APP.\n\n                                         8\n\fP. 26.1(a).   Saden’s timely filing of a notice of appeal invoked this court’s\n\njurisdiction. See TEX. R. APP. P. 25.1(b).\n\n      We hold that Saden has standing, and we otherwise have jurisdiction over\n\nthis appeal. Accordingly, we deny Smith’s motion to dismiss the appeal.\n\nII.   Saden’s appeal on the merits\n\n      Appellee Brian Smith is the owner of Cash Register Sales and Service of\n\nHouston, Inc., which does business as CRS, Texas. The company was founded by\n\nSmith’s father more than 30 years ago to sell cash registers, and in more recent\n\nyears it sold “point of sale systems” commonly used in restaurants. Appellant\n\nCharles Saden worked as a salesman for a company in the business of processing\n\ncredit card payments. Saden called on CRS, Texas to solicit leads or referrals for\n\ncustomers in 1999, which is when he first met Smith. From 1999 to 2001, Saden\n\nand Smith worked together on such deals, but in 2001 Saden resigned from his job\n\nand approached Smith about forming a new credit card processing company.\n\n      Smith agreed and contributed $10,000 to enable the newly formed company\n\nto pay for an affiliation with National Processing, which would allow the company\n\nto enter the credit card processing market. Smith testified that he did not mind\n\nbeing the only one to contribute money because he knew that Saden was\n\nunemployed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f      Smith testified that they agreed that Saden would run the business. “His\n\nposition would be the president and everything from top to bottom. Obviously, if\n\nit’s just Chuck and I, I was president of CRS, Texas, and that was my full-time job\n\nso Chuck’s responsibility would be to run the company and to make it grow.”\n\nSmith said, “I was to be a silent partner, I was not involved in working there day-\n\nto-day.” But he also said that he brought expertise and experience in the point-of-\n\nsale business to the venture. In particular, Smith’s point-of-sale customers needed\n\ncard processing services, so he brought the potential to generate business by\n\nreferring customers to the new company. Smith said that Saden was bringing\n\n“[h]is experience and knowledge in the credit and processing business. This is\n\nwhat he was experienced in so he was going to facilitate in helping to grow the\n\nPOS Card Processing business.”\n\n      In 2001, Saden and Smith formed and became co-owners in POS Card\n\nProcessing, Inc. POS sold terminals for card processing and facilitated processing\n\nagreements between merchants and banks. It generated revenue by receiving a\n\nfraction of the fees that the bank charged on each card transaction. POS initially\n\nreceived its share of the fees by check and later by direct deposit into a bank\n\naccount.\n\n      Saden and Smith each owned a 50% share of POS, and both were directors\n\nof the company. Smith testified:\n\n                                        10\n\f            From the onset it was a 50/50 deal. We were to be paid\n      equally, the board, me and him, it required us both to agree.\n\n            ....\n\n            I was half owner of the company, and the agreement was we\n      would share equally in the revenues that POS Card Processing\n      generated.\n\n            ....\n\n            We would be paid equally, we were 50 percent owners.\n\n      Saden was appointed president of POS and chairman of the board of\n\ndirectors, and Smith was appointed as secretary and treasurer. They agreed in\n\nwriting that “until further action of the Directors, no Director of the Corporation\n\nshall receive a salary in such capacity” and that the directors and officers were\n\nauthorized to hire and supervise employees and independent contractors to\n\naccomplish the goals of the business. However, Smith testified that he understood\n\nthat they would hire only independent contractors. And the bylaws included the\n\nfollowing provision:\n\n      3.01 Powers. The Directors shall act only as a board and an\n      individual Director shall have no power as such. All corporate powers\n      of the corporation shall be exercised by or under the authority of the\n      Board of Directors and the business and affairs of the corporation\n      shall be controlled by the Board of Directors subject to such\n      limitations as are imposed by law, the articles of incorporation or\n      these Bylaws regarding actions to be authorized or approved by the\n      shareholders. The Board of Directors may by contract or otherwise\n      give general, limited or special power and authority to agents of the\n      corporation to transact any special business requiring such\n      authorization.\n                                        11\n\f      Saden agreed that, as directors, neither he nor Smith could unilaterally enter\n\ninto a management contract. Rather, the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and\n\nminutes of annual meetings indicated that they had to take such actions together as\n\nboard of directors. Smith testified that the arrangement required them “to discuss\n\nand . . . to come to agreements together, not acting independently or separately\n\nfrom each other.” However Saden repeatedly testified that the parties varied their\n\ninitial agreement by later verbal agreements, and that they did not operate the\n\nbusiness in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws. He said,\n\n“Everything about this case is all about verbal agreements . . . .”\n\n      For example, Saden testified that he and Smith had a verbal agreement that\n\nin the first year of POS’s existence, Saden was entitled to all of the profits from the\n\nsale of card processing terminals.       But Smith testified that he never had a\n\nconversation with Saden about his keeping the equipment sales revenue for\n\nhimself. Both Saden and his adult daughter, Charlyn, received salaries from POS.\n\nSaden testified that the board of directors “verbally agreed” to pay the salaries.\n\nBut Smith said they only discussed Charlyn working on commission, not for a\n\nsalary. Smith testified that he first learned during the course of litigation that POS\n\nhad been paying Saden and Charlyn salaries, which Smith called “exorbitant.”\n\nSaden testified that Smith verbally agreed that POS would pay Saden’s expenses\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\ffor attending a trade show. But Smith said that he did not agree to that and that he\n\nexpected Saden to pay his own expenses to attend the show, just as he did.\n\n      POS had a bank account with Klein Bank, which later became Amegy Bank.\n\nInitially, POS received its share of card processing fees by direct deposit into this\n\nbank account. While Smith testified that from 2001 to September 2008, CRS,\n\nTexas exclusively referred its customers to POS for services, Saden testified that\n\nhe had grown frustrated by Smith’s lack of interest and participation in the\n\nbusiness.   Saden testified that CRS, Texas was not referring business and,\n\ntherefore, he was generating the business on his own. So Saden began doing\n\nbusiness separately as “Precision Payment Company,” engaging in exactly the\n\nsame line of business as POS. Saden created a bank account at Klein Bank in his\n\nown name for this purpose.\n\n      From that point on, Saden engaged in a course of action that caused revenue\n\nfrom existing and new POS clients to be deposited in his personal bank account at\n\nKlein Bank. At trial, Saden did not deny that he had engaged in such actions. He\n\nconceded he created fraudulent checks bearing the POS name and his personal\n\nchecking account number. And he conceded that he diverted money that should\n\nhave gone to POS’s bank account into his own account, falsified the POS records\n\nso it would appear that lesser amounts were being deposited into the POS account\n\nfrom bank agents who processed the credit card transactions, and failed to inform\n\n                                         13\n\fSmith of or lied to him about the amount of money that POS was earning. Saden\n\ndid not distribute POS revenue equally. For example, Saden testified that in 2002\n\nhe paid himself $63,000 and paid Smith only $10,000.\n\n      Saden said that, despite his conduct, Smith earned more money than he\n\nwould have under prior business arrangements. He blamed Smith for not being\n\naware of his wrongful conduct.        At trial, Saden was questioned about his\n\n“skimming off the top” of the POS accounts:\n\n      Q.     Did you think that’s something that your business partner\n             would want to know?\n\n      A.     If he wanted to participate and get to know things he could have\n             spent a lot more time involved in the operation, including\n             referring like kind businesses.\n\n      Q.     So, your position is then hey, if he had gotten more involved he\n             would have caught this theft but shame on him for not getting\n             more involved?\n\n      A.     He was secretary-treasurer and he certainly didn’t have an idea\n             of what was going on in the corporation.\n\n      ....\n\n      Q.     You’re not telling the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you\n             told Mr. Smith you were skimming this money off the top, are\n             you?\n\n      A.     I didn’t tell Mr. Smith I was skimming off of the account.\n\n      Q.     You didn’t tell him, hey I’m getting 100 percent over here and\n             I’m going to give 60 percent of that to POS, did you?\n\n      A.     I can’t remember that conversation.\n                                        14\n\f      Q.    Right. But so you would then decide, to use my example, if\n            you got 50 or 60 in one particular month you would then write a\n            check over to POS, put it in their bank account and say 25.\n            Right?\n\n      A.    They got what they deserved.\n\n      Smith testified that he “relied totally” on Saden with respect to his\n\nexpectations of revenue and growth of POS. Early on, he did not review the\n\ncompany’s books. He received monthly checks for what he believed was his\n\nportion of the revenue, but he discovered during the course of litigation that Saden\n\nnever followed the parties’ agreement that both directors would be paid equally.\n\nHe testified that he first learned during the litigation of many of Saden’s actions,\n\nincluding his creation of Precision Payment Company and that he had deposited\n\nPOS money in his personal account. Smith also first learned in litigation that\n\nSaden sold two separate POS account portfolios for far more than he deposited into\n\nPOS accounts or told Smith (one for $92,000 and the other for $286,000, but in\n\neach case the amount actually received by POS was approximately $53,000 to\n\n$54,000).\n\n      Around July 2008, after Smith had sought but not received additional\n\ninformation about the management and finances of the business, he and Saden,\n\nwho was also unhappy with the arrangement, discussed ending the business. They\n\nmet again in September 2008, and Smith asked for an accounting. Saden provided\n\n                                        15\n\fsome information, but he did not give Smith “source information” that would have\n\nshown which processor deposited which amounts at which times. Smith said, “I\n\nthink his attitude was like this is all you’re going to get. I knew we weren’t getting\n\ntoo terribly far with that information. I left with maybe ten pages of printout and\n\nthat was it.”\n\n      Smith ultimately sued Saden for, among other things, breach of contract and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Smith alleged that he was bringing his claims both in his\n\npersonal capacity and in a derivative capacity as a shareholder of POS. He alleged\n\nthat Saden breached a fiduciary duty owed to him personally because POS was\n\noperated as a partnership, the articles of organization and by-laws of POS vested\n\ncontrol of the company in Saden and gave rise to a contractual fiduciary duty, and\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the creation and operation of POS gave rise to a\n\nconfidential relationship between Saden and Smith. As to his personal breach of\n\ncontract claim, Smith alleged that Saden breached his “contractual obligations, and\n\nSmith’s contractual rights, under the several agreements signed by the parties;\n\nincluding without limitation, the articles of organization and the by-laws of POS.”\n\n      The case was tried to a jury. At trial, both Saden and Smith testified, among\n\nother things, about their history of working together, the formation and operation\n\nof POS, and their agreement as to sharing revenue. Smith also presented the\n\ntestimony of Bill Shields, an accountant who analyzed POS and Precision\n\n                                         16\n\faccounting records, including balance sheets, profit and loss statements, general\n\nledgers, and tax records. The accounting spreadsheets that formed the basis for his\n\ntestimony were admitted into evidence. Based on information he received from\n\nSmith, Shields assumed that the parties’ agreement required an equal division of\n\nrevenues, and his analysis did not credit Saden for expenses which were disputed\n\nby Smith. Shields testified that between 2002 and 2008, POS had actual revenue\n\nof $3.77 million, and in addition to that, $2.41 million was diverted from POS to\n\nPrecision.    Shields explained his calculations and the spreadsheets that were\n\nadmitted into evidence at trial. He calculated the amount of money which in his\n\nopinion was due to Smith, based on sharing the revenues but not the disputed\n\nexpenses, and including revenue diverted to other entities that should have accrued\n\nto POS.      Based on his calculations, Shields testified that Saden owed Smith\n\n$941,907. Shields also testified that $941,907 “represents the excess portion of the\n\nincome that was either received by or directed to the benefit of Saden.” He said\n\nthat $941,907 was “solely” what Smith was entitled to receive.\n\n      Shields also testified about the expenses charged to POS. Although POS\n\nhad gross income of $3.77 million, it turned a total profit of only approximately\n\n$4,000 over the relevant years. He explained that the money Saden had paid to\n\nhimself and family members, including personal living expenses, accounted for the\n\nentire difference between the company’s revenue and its profit.\n\n                                        17\n\f         Two causes of action against Saden—breach of contract and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty—were submitted to the jury. The breach of contract questions\n\nasked:\n\n                               QUESTION NO. 1\n\n               Did Brian Smith and Charles Saden agree to equally split the\n         revenues, less reasonable and necessary expenses, derived from the\n         business agreed to be conducted by POS?\n\n               In deciding whether the parties reached an agreement, you may\n         consider what they said and did in light of the surrounding\n         circumstances, including any earlier course of dealing. You may not\n         consider the parties’ unexpressed thoughts or intentions.\n\n               If your answer to Question No. 1 is “Yes,” then answer the\n         following question. Otherwise, do not answer the following question.\n\n                               QUESTION NO. 2\n\n                Did Charles Saden fail to comply with the agreement?\n\n         ....\n\n                               QUESTION NO. 4\n\n                What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly\n         and reasonably compensate Brian Smith for his damages, if any, that\n         resulted from Charles Saden’s failure to comply with the agreement?\n\n               Lost profits that are a natural, probable, and foreseeable\n         consequence of Chuck Saden’s failure to comply with the agreement.\n\n         Answer in dollars and cents if any.\n\nSaden objected to Question No. 1 on the grounds that there was no evidence of\n\nreasonable and necessary expenses and there was no definition of reasonable and\n                                           18\n\fnecessary expenses. The trial court overruled both objections. Neither party\n\nobjected to questions 2 or 4.\n\n      The relevant breach of fiduciary duty questions asked:\n\n                                QUESTION NO. 8\n\n           Did Charles Saden comply with his fiduciary duties to Brian\n      Smith?\n\n            Because a relationship of trust and confidence existed between\n      them, Charles Saden owed Brian Smith a fiduciary duty. To prove he\n      complied with his duty, Charles Saden must show:\n\n             a. The transactions in question were fair and equitable to Brian\n                Smith;\n\n             b. Charles Saden made reasonable use of the confidence that\n                Brian Smith placed in him;\n\n             c. Charles Saden acted in the utmost good faith and exercised\n                the most scrupulous honesty toward Brian Smith;\n\n             d. Charles Saden placed the interests of Brian Smith before his\n                own, did not use the advantage of his position to gain any\n                benefit for himself at the expense of Brian Smith, and did\n                not place himself in any position where his self-interest\n                might conflict with his obligations as a fiduciary; and\n\n             e. Charles Saden fully and fairly disclosed all important\n                information to Brian Smith concerning the transactions.\n\n      ....\n\n            If your answer to Question No. 8 is “No,” then answer the\n      following question. Otherwise do not answer the following question.\n\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f                        QUESTION NO. 10\n\n       What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly\nand reasonably compensate Brian Smith for his damages, if any, that\nwere proximately caused by Charles Saden’s failure to comply with\nhis fiduciary duties to Brian Smith?\n\n“Proximate cause” has two parts:\n\n1. A proximate cause is a substantial factor that in a natural and\n   continuous sequence brings about an event and without which the\n   event would not have occurred; and\n\n2. A proximate cause is foreseeable. “Foreseeable” means that a\n   person using ordinary care would have reasonably anticipated that\n   his acts or failure to act would have caused the event or some\n   similar event.\n\nThere may be more than one proximate cause of an event.\n\n        Consider the following elements of damages, if any, and none\nother. You shall not award any sum of money on any element if you\nhave otherwise, under some other element, awarded a sum of money\nfor the same loss. That is, do not compensate for the same loss twice,\nif any.\n\n       Lost profits that are a natural, probable, and foreseeable\nconsequence of Chuck Saden’s failure to comply with his fiduciary\nduties to Brian Smith.\n\n....\n\n      If your answer to Question No. 8 is “No,” then answer the\nfollowing question. Otherwise, do not answer the following question.\n\n                        QUESTION NO. 11\n\n       What was the amount of Charles Saden’s profit from the\nconduct, if any, that you have found to be a breach of Charles Saden’s\nfiduciary duties to Brian Smith?\n                                   20\n\fSmith objected to the omission of separate questions pertaining to his derivative\n\nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, and he requested their inclusion. The trial\n\ncourt denied these requests. Saden made the following objections to questions 8,\n\n10, and 11:\n\n      Defense counsel: Defendants also object to Question No. 8 in the\n                       jury charge.       The existence—first of all,\n                       defendants object to the inclusion of an informal\n                       fiduciary duty because there is no evidence of a\n                       confidential relationship that predates the POS\n                       transaction and for that reason we don’t believe\n                       there should be an informal fiduciary duty\n                       question.\n\n      Court:            Overruled.\n\n      Defense counsel: To the extent that it is included we do require—we\n                       object to the extent there is no language to support\n                       or there isn’t a definition given to [the] jury that\n                       the relationship must have existed prior to and\n                       separate from the transaction giving rise to the\n                       alleged breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n      Court:            Overruled.\n\n      Defense counsel: And we would like to submit our proposed\n                       Question No. 8—actually, 8 should have been with\n                       regard to my last question. I apologize, Your\n                       Honor.\n\n      Court:            Well, whatever.\n\n      Defense counsel: I’m guessing the last one should have been with\n                       regard to this. And, I’ll go ahead and on the same\n                       basis we object to Question No. 9, 10, 11, 12 again\n                       on the basis there is no evidence of written formal\n                                       21\n\f                            fiduciary duty or        relationship—confidential\n                            relationship of trust.\n\n          Court:            Overruled, overruled, overruled, overruled.\n\n          The jury found that Smith and Saden had an agreement, which only Saden\n\nhad breached. It also found that Saden did not comply with his fiduciary duties.\n\nThe jury awarded damages in the following amounts: (1) $941,907 for breach of\n\ncontract, (2) $393,093 for breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) $941,907 for Saden’s\n\nprofit from the conduct found to be a breach of his fiduciary duties. Smith moved\n\nfor entry of judgment on the verdict, for a turnover, and for permanent injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n          The trial court rendered judgment for (1) $941,907 for breach of contract,\n\nplus attorney’s fees of $465,173.27 (and contingent appellate attorney’s fees in the\n\naggregate amount of $125,000) and prejudgment interest in the amount of\n\n$91,255.35; (2) $393,093 for breach of fiduciary duty, plus prejudgment interest in\n\nthe amount of $38,090.24; and (3) $941,907 for equitable disgorgement of profits\n\n“found by the jury to have been obtained by [Saden] as a result of his acts of fraud,\n\ndefalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary capacity with\n\nrespect to [Smith],” plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $91,255.35. The\n\njudgment also characterized the assets in possession of the receiver as having been\n\n“received or obtained as a result of Defendant, Charles R. Saden’s acts of fraud,\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fdefalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary capacity to\n\nPlaintiff, Brian Smith.”\n\n      Saden raises four issues on appeal. In his first issue, Saden argues that\n\nSmith, in his individual capacity, lacked standing to pursue the claims pleaded\n\nagainst Saden for damages related to POS. Second, Saden contends that Smith\n\nshould have been required to elect a remedy instead of recovering duplicative\n\ndamages for lost profits. Third, Saden challenges Smith’s recovery for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty because no question on the existence of a duty was submitted to the\n\njury and because there was no preexisting special relationship sufficient to support\n\na finding of an informal fiduciary duty. Finally, in his fourth issue Saden asks this\n\ncourt to reform the judgment to eliminate language not supported by any jury\n\nfinding, specifically the judgment’s reference to fraud, defalcation, and\n\nembezzlement.\n\n      A.     Smith’s standing\n\n      Smith’s original petition included causes of action for breach of contract and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Saden challenges Smith’s standing as a 50% shareholder\n\nof POS to individually recover the company’s lost profits pursuant to those claims.\n\nAs noted above, standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot be\n\nwaived, and it is never presumed. See Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 443–44;\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d at 553–54. Smith had standing to assert the causes of action\n\n                                         23\n\fsubmitted to the jury if he raised “an actual, not merely a hypothetical or\n\ngeneralized grievance.” Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 302.\n\n      Saden relies on Wingate v. Hajdik, 795 S.W.2d 717 (Tex. 1990), for the\n\nproposition that Smith cannot recover personally for damages incurred by a\n\ncorporation of which he is a shareholder. In that case, the Supreme Court of Texas\n\nheld that “[a] corporate stockholder cannot recover damages personally for a\n\nwrong done solely to the corporation, even though he may be injured by that\n\nwrong.” Wingate, 795 S.W.3d at 719. A shareholder may nevertheless recover\n\ndamages “for wrongs done to him individually” when he pleads and proves that the\n\ndefendant has violated a duty that he owed the shareholder, which arises from\n\ncontract or otherwise. Id.\n\n      Saden filed special exceptions arguing that “the essence of Smith’s\n\nallegations is to vindicate for wrongs allegedly done to POS, as opposed to wrongs\n\ndirected at Smith individually.” The trial court denied the special exceptions, and\n\nSmith later amended his petition, specifically pleading that he was alleging various\n\ncauses of action—including breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty—as\n\nboth individual and derivative claims. Specifically, Smith alleged a claim for a\n\npersonal breach of contract based on “contractual obligations, and Smith’s\n\ncontractual rights, under the several agreements signed by the parties; including\n\nwithout limitation, the articles of organization and the by-laws of POS.” Smith\n\n                                        24\n\falso alleged that Saden breached a fiduciary duty owed to him personally because\n\nof the circumstances surrounding the creation and operation of POS which\n\nallegedly created a confidential relationship between them.\n\n      At trial, there was evidence that Smith and Saden—the sole directors,\n\nofficers, and shareholders of the corporation—agreed to split the revenues from\n\nPOS equally.      There was also evidence of the factual circumstances of the\n\nrelationship between Saden and Smith prior to the formation of POS.\n\n      At the charge conference, Smith sought to include jury questions on his\n\nderivative claims and the court refused his requests. Saden does not challenge\n\nSmith’s standing to bring a derivative claim, and the only apparent basis for the\n\ntrial court’s failure to separately submit questions on the derivative claims stems\n\nfrom the fact that POS was a closely held corporation. See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE\n\nANN. § 21.563(a) (West 2012). If justice requires, a court may treat a derivative\n\nproceeding brought by a shareholder of a closely held corporation as if it were a\n\ndirect action brought by the shareholder for the shareholder’s own benefit. Id.\n\n§ 21.563(c)(1).    Smith met these criteria and therefore the trial court was\n\nauthorized to act as it did, treating his derivative claim as a direct claim.\n\n      We hold that Smith had standing to assert his claims, whether individually or\n\nderivatively, and we overrule Saden’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\f        B.    Breach of fiduciary duty\n\n        Saden argues that Smith cannot recover for breach of fiduciary duty because\n\nany duty was owed to the corporation, no duty question was submitted to the jury,\n\nand there was no pre-existing special relationship to support an informal fiduciary\n\nduty.\n\n        We again note the special circumstances applicable to a closely held\n\ncorporation. Smith pleaded his claims both in his individual capacity and also\n\nderivatively on behalf of the closely held corporation. The evidence conclusively\n\nestablished that POS was a closely held corporation and that Smith was one of its\n\ntwo 50% shareholders. Accordingly, the trial court was authorized to treat the\n\nderivative claims as individual claims. See id. Moreover, “a recovery in a direct\n\nor derivative proceeding by a shareholder may be paid directly to the plaintiff or to\n\nthe corporation if necessary to protect the interests of creditors or other\n\nshareholders of the corporation.” Id. § 21.563(c)(2); Swank v. Cunningham, 258\n\nS.W.3d 647, 665 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, pet. denied). Saden devotes his\n\nbriefing on this issue to the lack of jury findings that a relationship of trust and\n\nconfidence existed between Saden and Smith before the formation of POS. In his\n\nbrief, Saden argues about Smith’s failure to secure jury findings that there was “a\n\npre-existing special or fiduciary relationship.” He notes that the trial court denied\n\nhis motion for directed verdict, in which he argued, “The evidence has shown they\n\n                                         26\n\fhad no relationship whatsoever before they met with regard to the POS venture.”\n\nHe also notes his objection to jury question no. 8 on the basis that there was no\n\nevidence of “a confidential relationship that predates the POS transaction.”\n\n      Question No. 8 presupposed the existence of a fiduciary duty, and asked,\n\n“Did Charles Saden comply with his fiduciary duties to Brian Smith?” There is no\n\nquestion that as an officer of POS, Saden owed a fiduciary duty to the corporation\n\nas a matter of law. See, e.g., Int’l Bankers Life Ins. Co. v. Holloway, 368 S.W.2d\n\n567, 576 (Tex. 1963). Because POS was a close corporation and Smith was one of\n\nits shareholders, the trial court was authorized to allow Smith to pursue his\n\nderivative claim on behalf of POS as if it were his own. See TEX. BUS. ORGS.\n\nCODE ANN. § 21.563(c)(1) & (2). Smith does not contest that sufficient evidence\n\nsupports the jury’s answer to Question No. 8 regarding breach. Because Smith\n\nowed a fiduciary duty as a matter of law, the trial court did not err in submitting\n\nthis claim to the jury. The jury’s finding of a breach of fiduciary duty was\n\nsupported by the evidence.\n\n      In an attempt to avoid the application of section 21.563(c), Saden primarily\n\nrelies upon Guerra v. Guerra, No. 04-10-00271-CV, 2011 WL 3715051 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio Aug. 24, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.), for the proposition that\n\nSmith cannot use the provision to obtain an individual recovery. In Guerra, a\n\nminority shareholder in a family business asserted claims “on her own behalf . . .\n\n                                         27\n\fbased solely on her individual damages, not on any damage to the corporation.”\n\n2011 WL 3715051, at *5. In that circumstance, the court of appeals held that\n\nalthough section 5.14 of the Business Corporation Act (the predecessor to section\n\n21.563) allowed a derivative claim to be “treated by a court as a direct action\n\nbrought by the shareholder for the shareholder’s own benefit,” the provision\n\nnevertheless “does not allow a shareholder an individual claim.” Guerra, 2011\n\nWL 3715051, at *5. That reasoning does not apply to this case, in which Smith\n\nactually has alleged and demonstrated injury to the corporation, POS.\n\n      The other two cases referenced by Saden in this regard are also\n\ndistinguishable.   In 2055 Inc. v. McTague, No. 05-08-01057-CV, 2009 WL\n\n2506342 (Tex. App.—Dallas Aug. 18, 2009, no pet.), the defendants attempted to\n\nuse a release signed by an individual to bar that individual’s derivative claim\n\nasserted on behalf of a corporation of which she was a shareholder. The court of\n\nappeals declined to apply article 5.14 to treat the corporation’s claims as ones “in\n\nreality” filed by the individual shareholder subject to a contractual release—a\n\ncompletely inapposite scenario. 2055 Inc., 2009 WL 2506342, at *8.\n\n      In Swank v. Cunningham, 258 S.W.3d 647 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, pet.\n\ndenied), the court affirmed a summary judgment against two individuals who\n\npurported to assert derivative claims on behalf of a corporation on the ground that\n\nevidence had been presented sufficient to disprove that the individuals were\n\n                                        28\n\fshareholders of the subject company, and the individuals failed to come forward\n\nwith evidence to raise a fact issue as to whether they owned stock in the company.\n\nSwank, 258 S.W.3d at 662–64. In an alternative holding, the court suggested that\n\neven if the individual claimants had been shareholders, the trial court acted within\n\nits discretion by declining to allow them to pursue derivative claims in their\n\nindividual capacities and for their own benefit because they only claimed to own\n\n40% of the company and the record reflected “substantial and longstanding\n\ndisputes” between them and the majority shareholder, which would have required\n\nthat any recovery for the company would have to be paid to the company to protect\n\nthe majority shareholder’s interest. Id. at 664–66. The factual circumstances of\n\nSmith’s pursuit of derivative claims on behalf of POS do not share the\n\ncharacteristics that led the Swank court to observe, in dicta, that the trial judge\n\nwould have acted in his discretion to refuse to authorize individual shareholders to\n\npursue derivative claims. See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 21.563(c)(1).\n\n      Because Saden and Smith are the only shareholders of POS, the injury\n\nsuffered by the corporation is the injury suffered by Smith as 50% shareholder to\n\nthe extent it inured to the other 50% shareholder’s benefit. Considering that Smith\n\nwas the only shareholder injured by Saden’s wrongful conduct (while Saden\n\nhimself, as the only other shareholder, benefited from it), the recovery could be\n\npaid to Smith directly to protect his interests.\n\n                                           29\n\f      We therefore overrule the challenge to the liability finding on the claim for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\n\n      C.     Election of remedies\n\n      Saden argues that the trial court erred in awarding Smith duplicative\n\ndamages and that Smith was required to elect a remedy. Specifically Saden objects\n\nto the cumulative award of three separate measures of profits as actual damages for\n\nbreach of contract, actual damages for breach of fiduciary duty, and for equitable\n\ndisgorgement as a further remedy for breach of fiduciary duty. Saden raised this\n\nissue in a post-trial motion to modify, correct, or reform the judgment, which the\n\ntrial court denied. In this context, we review the trial court’s judgment for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Beaumont Bank, N.A. v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991);\n\nWagner v. Edlund, 229 S.W.3d 870, 879 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied). A\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion if it acts without reference to guiding rules and\n\nprinciples, or if it fails to follow such guiding rules and principles. Columbia Rio\n\nGrande Healthcare, L.P. v. Hawley, 284 S.W.3d 851, 856 (Tex. 2009); Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985). “Another way\n\nof stating the test is whether the act was arbitrary or unreasonable.” Downer, 701\n\nS.W.2d at 242.\n\n      “A party is generally entitled to sue and to seek damages on alternative\n\ntheories.” Waite Hill Servs., Inc. v. World Class Metal Works, Inc., 959 S.W.2d\n\n                                         30\n\f182, 184 (Tex. 1998); see also Madison v. Williamson, 241 S.W.3d 145, 158 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).        “If a plaintiff pleads alternate\n\ntheories of liability, a judgment awarding damages on each alternate theory may be\n\nupheld if the theories depend on separate and distinct injuries and if separate and\n\ndistinct damages findings are made as to each theory.” Madison, 241 S.W.3d at\n\n158 (citing Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp., 747 S.W.2d 361, 367 (Tex.\n\n1987)). A corollary to this principle is the one-satisfaction rule: for one injury\n\nthere can only be one recovery. See, e.g., Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212\n\nS.W.3d 299, 303 (Tex. 2006); see also Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d\n\n378, 390 (Tex. 2000); Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex.\n\n1991). When a defendant’s acts result in a single injury, and the jury returns\n\nfavorable findings on more than one theory of liability, the plaintiff is entitled to\n\njudgment on the theory affording him the greatest relief. See Birchfield, 747\n\nS.W.2d at 367; Madison, 241 S.W.3d at 158–59.\n\n      In order to answer the question of whether an election of remedies was\n\nrequired in this case, it is therefore necessary to carefully review the record to\n\ndetermine whether the claimant supported alternate theories of liability with\n\nevidence indicating separate and distinct injuries resulting in separate and distinct\n\ndamages. In this case, the jury was asked to quantify “profits” in three different\n\nquestions: in question no. 4 (breach of contract lost-profits damages), in question\n\n                                         31\n\fno. 10 (breach of fiduciary duty lost-profits damages), and in question no. 11\n\n(equitable disgorgement of profits). Questions 4 and 10 specifically instructed the\n\njury to award only “lost profits,” if any, defined in each case as the “natural,\n\nprobable, and foreseeable consequence” of Saden’s failure to comply with his\n\ncontractual or fiduciary duty. While “[r]ecovery for lost profits does not require\n\nthat the loss be susceptible of exact calculation,” the amount of lost profits “must\n\nbe shown by competent evidence with reasonable certainty.” Holt Atherton Indus.,\n\nInc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Tex. 1992). “As a minimum, opinions or\n\nestimates of lost profits must be based on objective facts, figures, or data from\n\nwhich the amount of lost profits can be ascertained.” Id.; see also Natural Gas\n\nPipeline Co. v. Justiss, 397 S.W.3d 150, 157 (Tex. 2012) (“a business owner’s\n\nconclusory or speculative testimony of lost profits will not support a judgment”).\n\n      At trial, Smith testified about various acts of self-dealing that Saden\n\ncommitted, such as selling POS accounts and keeping some of the money for\n\nhimself in the Precision account. There were many questions about the sums of\n\nmoney generated as a result of POS business and whether the money was deposited\n\nin the POS account or a Precision account, whether the money was split evenly,\n\nand whether Saden used the money for his personal use. There were also questions\n\nabout expenses and what or whether POS expenses were paid by money kept in the\n\nPrecision account. And Smith was asked about the nature of the injury that he\n\n                                         32\n\fsuffered as a result of the actions alleged in this lawsuit. Smith said, “I as a\n\nshareholder, owner of POS Card Processing was deprived of any income that I\n\nshould have received out of the profits that were earned by POS Card Processing,\n\nso the company was damaged, and I was damaged.” Smith testified that “the\n\nreduction of the value to POS” was “was the primary reason” he was “damaged\n\nindividually.”\n\n      To prove his damages at trial, Smith presented the testimony of Bill Shields,\n\nan accountant who analyzed the records of POS and Precision. Shields relied on\n\ncertain assumptions in determining the amount of money Saden owed Smith.\n\nBasing his analysis on Smith’s version of events, he assumed that the men agreed\n\nto share the company’s revenue equally but did not agree to all of the expenses\n\nincurred by Saden and charged to POS.          Thus, Shields did not consider as\n\nreasonable and necessary business expenses the money that Saden spent on salaries\n\nfor him and his relatives or the expenses that otherwise personally benefited Saden\n\n(such as traveling and meals). Shields included as part of the revenue that should\n\nhave accrued to POS under the agreement $2.41 million that was diverted from\n\nPOS to Precision. He testified that based on his analysis, Saden owed Smith\n\n“solely” $941,907, explaining that this amount “represents the excess portion of\n\nthe income that was either received by or directed to the benefit of Saden.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         33\n\f      As was the case in Madison v. Williamson, 241 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied), Smith made no attempt in the trial court to\n\ndistinguish between the damages he suffered as a result of Saden’s breach of\n\ncontract and his breach of fiduciary duty. Instead, Smith presented a unified\n\ndamages model through the testimony of Shields, who explained that he included\n\nthe elements of self-dealing that were apparent from the accounting records in\n\ndetermining the distributions that Smith should have received from POS. There\n\nwas no attempt to segregate damages attributable to breach of the parties’\n\nagreement from any other damages that somehow may have been attributable to\n\nseparate disloyal acts in breach of Smith’s fiduciary duty. Moreover, the evidence\n\nat trial did not clearly show two separate injuries in this regard. Rather, it showed\n\ngenerally that Saden diverted revenue to himself and failed to evenly divide what\n\nrevenue was actually received by POS.         The expert testimony indicated that\n\nSmith’s share of the POS proceeds, which Shields calculated to be $941,907, was\n\neffectively the same as the profit Saden wrongfully obtained by breaching his\n\nfiduciary duty.\n\n      In his appellate brief, Smith contends that the separate awards for breach of\n\ncontract and breach of fiduciary duty are supported by the record, arguing:\n\n      The contract damages were limited to that portion of the fifty percent\n      (50%) of the business profits that were not paid to Smith by Saden,\n      whereas the fiduciary breach damages were, inter alia, caused by\n      Smith’s [a] failure to secure the best price possible for the POS\n                                         34\n\f      accounts that he secretly sold; [b] failure to secure commission rates\n      for POS equal to those he secured for himself; [c] sale of POS\n      accounts and equipment; [d] theft of $200,000 in certificates of\n      deposit; [e] use of POS funds to pay personal living expenses for\n      himself and his family; [f] theft of POS funds after the appointment of\n      the Receiver; and [g] enriching himself through a series of self-\n      dealing transactions. The damages caused by Saden’s breach of his\n      fiduciary duty were different from, and not part of, the contract\n      damages because they were of a nature that they did not cause an\n      unequal division of the profits from the business.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 27–28 (footnotes omitted); see also Dissent at 7.\n\n      We disagree.     First, there is significant overlap between this litany of\n\nSaden’s misdeeds and the misconduct documented and accounted for in the Shields\n\ndamages model, which represented “the excess portion of the income that was\n\neither received by or directed to the benefit of Saden.” For example, Shields’s\n\ncalculations expressly accounted for acts of corporate waste, most significantly\n\nincluding the “use of POS funds to pay personal living expenses for himself and\n\nhis family” in that his analysis did not treat those expenses as reasonable and\n\nnecessary corporate expenses, but instead treated $1,379,369 of expenses paid by\n\nPOS as “Distributions to/for the benefit of C. Saden.” Likewise, to the extent that\n\nSmith’s reference to “enriching himself through a series of self-dealing\n\ntransactions” is also a reference to the payment of Saden’s living expenses with\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fPOS funds, as strongly suggested by a footnote in Smith’s brief,1 that category also\n\nis incorporated into the Shields damages model. Finally in this regard, Smith’s\n\nreference to the “theft of $200,000 in certificates of deposit” is not further\n\nsupported or explained with any citation to the record, but it apparently refers to a\n\nCD that Saden testified that he purchased from the Precision account with funds\n\n1\n      In Smith’s appellee’s brief, the reference to Saden “enriching himself\n      through a series of self-dealing transactions” is followed by a footnote,\n      which reads:\n\n             In fact, Shields, the accounting expert, allowed for $1,600,000\n             in expenses in computing the contract damages, even though\n             many of those payments were to or for self-dealing transactions\n             for the benefit of Saden and his family (e.g., meals, insurance\n             and utilities including, gas, water, electricity and other\n             expenses). See PX 301. Although those payments are not\n             included in Smith’s contract damages, but they are tort damages\n             in Smith’s breach of fiduciary duty claim, and they far exceed\n             the $393,093.00 found by the jury. Kinzbach Tool Co. v\n             Corbett-Wallace Corp., S.W.2d 509, 512–14 (Tex. 1942).\n\n      Appellee’s Brief at 28 n.42. Though the source of the $1,600,000 figure is\n      unexplained, to the extent Smith argues that the Shields model did not\n      include payments “for the benefit of Saden and his family (e.g., meals,\n      insurance and utilities including, gas, water, electricity and other expenses),”\n      he plainly misstates the record. The examination and cross-examination of\n      Shields made quite clear that between POS and Precision, Shields\n      determined that Saden “paid himself through either salary, commissions,\n      benefits, personal expenses, home expense, whatever it may be,\n      $2,740,927.” Of this amount, the only expenses that Shields treated as\n      legitimate business expenses were commissions and director fees. The\n      Shields damages model accounts for payments made for the benefit of Saden\n      and his family, and it compensates Smith for his injury to the extent the\n      revenues of POS and Precision were not evenly split between him and Saden\n      as a result of such payments.\n\n                                         36\n\fthat were obtained from the sale of POS accounts. The Shields analysis includes\n\n$1,188,846 of distributions from Precision for the benefit of Saden, and while the\n\nrecord evidence does not include detailed individual transactions supporting that\n\nfigure, it does show total amounts of distributions broken down by year in amounts\n\nranging from $65,061 in 2004 to $397,995 in 2007. There is no evidence to\n\nsuggest that Saden’s purchase of a $200,000 certificate of deposit from Precision\n\nfunds for his own benefit is not included in Shields’s calculation of $1,188,846 of\n\ndistributions to Saden from Precision.\n\n      Second, the record reveals no competent evidence from which a fact finder\n\ncould determine with reasonable certainty the amount of lost profits separately\n\nattributable only to breach of contract or only to breach of fiduciary duty. See Holt\n\nAtherton, 835 S.W.2d at 84. The only element of damages listed in questions 4\n\nand 10 was “lost profits.” The charge instructed the jury to consider that element\n\nof damages, “if any, and none other.” Neither party objected to the lost-profits\n\nlanguage in the charge, and neither party requested a different or additional\n\nmeasure of damages be submitted to the jury.\n\n      The jury awarded the full measure of lost profits supported by the\n\naccountant’s testimony as contract damages: $941,907. It may have been possible\n\nto categorize Saden’s various bad acts between breaches of contract and other\n\nseparate breaches of fiduciary duty, and then to quantify lost profits or other\n\n                                         37\n\fdamages attributable to each so as to identify separate injuries leading to separate\n\namounts of damages. But as this case was presented, tried, and charged to the jury,\n\nthe actual evidence of injury and lost profits did not show separate and distinct\n\ninjuries resulting in separate and distinct lost profits. See Madison, 241 S.W.3d at\n\n158. Smith’s damages model showed that he suffered one injury: he was deprived\n\nof all the money he was due from POS because of the various faithless actions\n\ntaken in violation of the parties’ agreement and Saden’s fiduciary duties.\n\n      To the extent Smith suggests that other lost profits may have been\n\nattributable to other bad acts not addressed by the Shields analysis, his brief has\n\npointed us to no such evidence in the record, and our own review has found none.\n\nSmith’s brief points to no evidence of any value—much less a valuation that would\n\nsatisfy Holt Atherton—assigned to the lost profits attributable to Saden’s “failure\n\nto secure the best price possible for the POS accounts that he secretly sold,”\n\n“failure to secure commission rates for POS equal to those he secured for himself,”\n\n“sale of POS accounts and equipment” (other than the purchase of the $200,000\n\ncertificate of deposit apparently included in Shields’s calculation of distributions\n\nfrom Precision to Saden), or “theft of POS funds after the appointment of the\n\nReceiver.” See Appellee’s Brief at 28.\n\n      In sum, Smith demonstrated his entitlement to a unified recovery for one\n\nbroadly described injury with one damages model sponsored by accountant\n\n                                         38\n\fShields. See id. Accordingly, Smith failed to justify separate awards for alternate\n\ntheories of liability, as the theories as presented at trial did not depend on separate\n\nand distinct injuries resulting in separate and distinct damages. See Madison, 241\n\nS.W.3d at 158.      Under such circumstances, allowing the recovery of actual\n\ndamages for both breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty violates the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule, and is therefore error. See, e.g., Downer, 701 S.W.2d at 241–42.\n\n      We reach a different conclusion with respect to the award of equitable\n\ndisgorgement of profits. Question no. 11, the basis for the equitable forfeiture\n\naward, was predicated on the liability question for breach of fiduciary duty, and it\n\nwas phrased in terms of the “profit” Saden obtained by his tortious conduct.\n\nNevertheless, equitable forfeiture is distinguishable from an award of actual\n\ndamages, in that it serves a separate function of protecting fiduciary relationships.\n\nERI Consulting Eng’rs, Inc. v. Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867, 874 (Tex. 2010). Even if\n\na fiduciary does not obtain a benefit by violating his duty, he still may be required\n\nto forfeit the right to compensation for his work. Id. at 873 (citing Burrow v. Arce,\n\n997 S.W.2d 229, 237 (Tex. 1999)). Saden did not present any legal challenge to\n\nthe amount of the equitable disgorgement award, so we express no opinion about\n\nthe measure of the equitable remedy awarded. Instead, Saden only challenges the\n\naward on the basis that it is duplicative of the other awards of damages, in\n\nviolation of the one-satisfaction rule. We hold that the one-satisfaction rule does\n\n                                          39\n\fnot preclude the recovery of both actual damages and the equitable remedy of\n\ndisgorgement of profits, as these remedies are intended to address separate and\n\ndistinct injuries. Cf. ERI Consulting, 318 S.W.3d at 882 (remanding case for\n\nfurther proceedings on both equitable disgorgement and lost-profits awards).\n\n      We sustain Saden’s issue in part and hold that on the facts of this case, the\n\ntrial court erred in rendering judgment that permitted duplicative recovery of actual\n\nlost-profit damages for both breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. We\n\noverrule Saden’s issue to the extent that he argues that the one-satisfaction rule\n\ndisallows an award of both actual damages and the equitable remedy of\n\ndisgorgement of profits. Ordinarily we would reform the judgment to effect an\n\nelection of the remedy that affords the prevailing party the greatest relief. See, e.g.,\n\nStar Houston, Inc. v. Shevack, 886 S.W.2d 414, 423 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1994), writ denied, 907 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. 1995) (per curiam). However, this\n\ncase is complicated by the fact of Saden’s bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court’s\n\norder of non-dischargeability. Because it is not readily apparent from the appellate\n\nrecord which theory of liability Smith would elect, we will remand to permit Smith\n\nto make an election.\n\n      D.     Findings of fraud, defalcation, embezzlement\n\n      In his fourth issue, Saden argues that the court erred by including recovery\n\nand findings on issues that were not submitted to the jury or conclusively\n\n                                          40\n\festablished. Specifically, Saden objects to the inclusion of language stating that he\n\ncommitted “acts of fraud, defalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving\n\nin a fiduciary capacity.” Saden also specifically objects to the following language\n\non page 4 of the trial court’s judgment:\n\n      The Court finds that all of the business and assets that are currently in\n      the Receiver’s possession, custody and control belong to POS, that\n      any such assets that are currently in the Receiver’s possession,\n      custody and control belong to POS, that any such assets received or\n      obtained by, or in the name of Defendants Charles R. Saden or\n      Precision Payments Company were received or obtained as a result of\n      Defendant, Charles R. Saden’s acts of fraud, defalcation and\n      embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary capacity to\n      Plaintiff, Brian Smith.\n\nSaden’s complaint appears to be two-fold, that: (1) the court erred by including in\n\nthe judgment findings of “fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement” that were not\n\nsubmitted to the jury and that Smith relied upon in the bankruptcy court to argue\n\nfor an order of non-dischargeability of the debt, and (2) the court erred by making\n\na determination regarding the assets that were then in the Receiver’s possession.\n\n      An issue must be submitted to the jury when it is (1) raised by the pleadings\n\nand the evidence, (2) disputed, and (3) properly requested. See Cianfichi v. White\n\nHouse Motor Hotel, 921 S.W.2d 441, 443 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996,\n\nwrit denied); see also T.O. Stanley Boot Co., Inc. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d\n\n218, 223 (Tex. 1992). Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 279 provides, “Upon appeal\n\nall independent grounds of recovery or of defense not conclusively established\n\n                                           41\n\funder the evidence and no element of which is submitted or requested are waived.”\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 279.\n\n      Common-law fraud includes both actual and constructive fraud. Cotton v.\n\nWeatherford Bancshares, Inc., 187 S.W.3d 687, 702 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2006, pet. denied). “A plaintiff seeking to prevail on claim of actual fraud must\n\nprove that (1) the defendant made a material misrepresentation; (2) the defendant\n\nknew the representation was false or made the representation recklessly without\n\nany knowledge of its truth; (3) the defendant made the representation with the\n\nintent that the other party would act on that representation or intended to induce the\n\nparty’s reliance on the representation; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury by\n\nactively and justifiably relying on that representation.” Exxon Corp. v. Emerald\n\nOil & Gas Co., L.C., 348 S.W.3d 194, 217 (Tex. 2011). However, constructive\n\nfraud is “the breach of some legal or equitable duty which, irrespective of moral\n\nguilt, the law declares fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others, to\n\nviolate confidence, or to injure public interests.” Archer v. Griffith, 390 S.W.2d\n\n735, 740 (Tex. 1964). “Evidence supporting a breach of fiduciary duty may, in\n\nappropriate circumstances, support a constructive-fraud finding.” Murphy v.

Ct. 1754, 1758–\n\n59 (2013) (in the course of holding that “defalcation” as used in 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 523(a)(4) requires an intentional wrong, generally observing broad disagreement\n\namong legal authorities about the meaning of “defalcation”); Balusik v.\n\nKollatschny, No. 01-99-01342-CV, 2002 WL 1822360, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] Aug. 2, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (“Defalcation is\n\nalso defined as ‘[l]oosely, the failure to meet an obligation; a nonfraudulent\n\ndefault.’”).\n\n       Embezzlement requires proof that (1) the defendant was the agent of the\n\nperson or corporation alleged to have been harmed and was charged with the duty\n\nof receiving money of his principal, (2) he received money belonging to his\n\nprincipal in the course of his employment, and (3) that he embezzled, misapplied,\n\nor converted it to his own use. Fellers v. State, 138 Tex. Crim. 307, 308, 136\n\nS.W.2d 217, 218 (Tex. Crim. App. 1940); see TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 32.45\n\n(West 2011) (misapplication of fiduciary property or property of financial\n\ninstitution).\n\n\n\n\n                                        43\n\f        Smith did not raise in his pleadings the issues of whether Saden committed\n\nacts of fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement. Nor did he request a jury question\n\non these issues. Comparing the elements of fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement\n\nto the jury charge, we conclude that not all of the elements of fraud, defalcation,\n\nand embezzlement were submitted to the jury. Accordingly, we hold that the trial\n\ncourt erred by including this language in the judgment, and we sustain this issue in\n\npart.\n\n        Finally, we consider Saden’s challenge regarding the portion of the\n\njudgment concerning the assets in the receiver’s possession. The court appointed a\n\nreceiver in February 2009, and the receiver took possession of POS along with the\n\nentities Saden created and used to divert POS revenues. Section 11.403 of the\n\nBusiness Organizations Code provides: “The court appointing a receiver under this\n\nsection has and shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over the specific property placed\n\nin receivership. The court shall determine the rights of the parties in the property\n\nor its proceeds.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 11.403(c) (West 2012). Here, the\n\njudgment noted that the trial court lacked authority to dispose of the property held\n\nby the receiver due to the automatic bankruptcy stay and ordered the future\n\ndelivery of the assets held by the receiver to the bankruptcy trustee.\n\n        Saden argues, without citation to authority, that “[t]he jury did not make any\n\nfindings about POS assets, nor was it asked anything about Precision Payment\n\n                                          44\n\fCompany or Hohen-Saden, LLC. The jury was asked about damages, not these\n\nissues of ownership or entitlement, and to make any such award or finding here\n\nwould also be a duplicative recovery.” But this particular aspect of the final\n\njudgment does not award a duplicative recovery: it defers determination of the\n\nownership of the assets held by the receiver to the bankruptcy court. We hold that\n\nthe court did not err in doing so.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the trial court’s judgment to the extent that it permitted\n\nduplicative recovery of damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and included additional unauthorized findings that Saden committed acts of\n\n“fraud,” “defalcation,” and “embezzlement,” and we remand to the trial court to\n\nallow Smith to elect a remedy and for entry of a new judgment, which does not\n\ninclude language purporting to make findings based on fraud, defalcation, or\n\nembezzlement.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Michael Massengale\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Jennings, Bland, and Massengale.\n\nJustice Jennings, dissenting.\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f46\n\f",

Saden and Brian Smith were the sole shareholders of POS Card\n\nProcessing, Inc. Saden appeals from a judgment against him for breach of contract\n\nand breach of fiduciary duty arising from actions taken in connection with his\n\fmanagement of the company. Smith moved to dismiss this appeal for want of\n\njurisdiction, while Saden raised four appellate issues, alleging: (1) Smith lacked\n\nstanding to recover damages for injuries to the corporation; (2) the trial court erred\n\nby not requiring Smith to elect a remedy; (3) the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment for breach of fiduciary duty because Saden owed Smith no fiduciary duty\n\nindividually; and (4) the trial court erred in rendering judgment on claims not\n\nsubmitted to the jury.\n\n      We conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal. We reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment to the extent that it permitted duplicative recovery of damages\n\nand included additional unauthorized findings, and we remand to the trial court to\n\nallow Smith to elect a remedy and for entry of a new judgment.\n\nI.    Appellate jurisdiction\n\n      After the jury’s verdict but before the trial court entered judgment, Saden\n\ninformed the court that he had filed for bankruptcy and that the automatic\n\nbankruptcy stay applied to all further matters in the case. The bankruptcy court\n\nconverted Saden’s bankruptcy from a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11\n\nto a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7, and it appointed a bankruptcy trustee.\n\nThe bankruptcy court granted Smith’s motion for relief from the automatic stay to\n\ncontinue the state court litigation. The order stated:\n\n            [It is] ORDERED that the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\n      § 362 is modified to permit the continuation of the State Court\n                                           2\n\f      Lawsuit, specifically the automatic stay is modified to allow the state\n      court to enter judgment as to liability and to award damages on of\n      Movant’s claims against the Debtor and the Debtor’s claims against\n      the Movants and allow the parties to prosecute any appeals of the final\n      judgment, provided, however, the automatic stay shall not be modified\n      to allow enforcement of such judgment against the Debtor or pursue\n      any right to collection against the Debtor that may arise out of the\n      State Court Lawsuit . . . .\n\n(Footnote omitted.)\n\n      The trial court then rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict.      On Smith’s\n\nbreach of contract claim, the trial court awarded $941,907, plus prejudgment\n\ninterest and attorney’s fees. For Smith’s breach of fiduciary duty claim the trial\n\ncourt awarded an additional $393,000 in actual damages (plus prejudgment\n\ninterest), as well as $941,907 (plus prejudgment interest) in equitable disgorgement\n\nof the profits “found by the jury to have been obtained by [Saden] as a result of his\n\nacts of fraud, defalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary\n\ncapacity with respect to [Smith].” Saden filed a motion for new trial, a motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a motion to modify, correct, or reform\n\nthe judgment. Saden’s motions were overruled by operation of law, and he timely\n\nfiled a notice of appeal.\n\n      Smith filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,\n\narguing that the bankruptcy trustee had exclusive standing to pursue an appeal of\n\nthe adverse judgment, and because the trustee did not file a notice of appeal, this\n\ncourt lacks appellate jurisdiction.    In response, Saden pointed out that the\n                                         3\n\fbankruptcy court allowed the appeal to proceed by its order that modified the\n\nautomatic stay to allow the trial court to enter judgment and authorized “the parties\n\nto prosecute any appeals of the final judgment.”        Saden also noted that the\n\nbankruptcy court, in the course of declining to discharge the debt, has rejected\n\nSmith’s argument in a “Judgment of Non-Dischargeability,” which provided:\n\n               For the reasons set forth on the record of February 10, 2011,\n        Charles R. Saden’s liability under the judgment of the 270th Judicial\n        District Court of Harris County, Texas in Cause 2009-00593 is\n        excepted from discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523.\n\n              If the state court’s judgment is reversed or modified on appeal,\n        this Court will reconsider this judgment pursuant to Rule 9024 of the\n        Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n\nFinally, Saden argues that he has standing because a state-court judgment cannot\n\nbe collaterally attacked in the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court in this\n\ncase relied on the state-court judgment against him, which recited the trial court’s\n\nfindings that he committed acts of fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement, in\n\nholding that the $3 million judgment underlying this appeal is not dischargeable in\n\nbankruptcy. He argues that a conclusion that the Bankruptcy Code’s automatic\n\nstay terminates his standing to challenge the otherwise unreviewable state-court\n\njudgment that is the basis of the nondischargeability holding is “circular reasoning\n\nand would be a denial of constitutional rights of due process and due course of\n\nlaw.”\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      Meanwhile, after Smith filed his motion to dismiss in this court, Saden filed\n\nin the bankruptcy court an emergency motion to confirm his authority to appeal the\n\nstate-court judgment. The bankruptcy court issued an order which provided:\n\n            The Court cannot, should not and will not determine whether\n      the First Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over Saden’s notice of\n      appeal. That is a matter left solely to the Texas courts.\n\n             The principal case cited by Brian Smith in opposition to the\n      Debtor’s motion is In re Mozer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2018396\"><a href=\"/opinion/2018396/in-re-mozer/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.D. Cal. 2003). Mozer\n      indeed deals with a similar situation as the present one—but with a\n      major distinction. The state court findings in Mozer were insufficient\n      to establish an exception to discharge:\n\n            However, sale of the Defensive Appellate Rights by her\n            Trustee is not literally nor is it tantamount to a waiver of\n            dischargeability by the Trustee.           The underlying\n            judgment against Mozer, even if final, is not prima facie\n            non-dischargeable. Mozer has represented to this Court\n            that “additional facts would need to be established and\n            that the debt would not be non-dischargeable even if the\n            state court judgement were to become final.”\n            (Appellants’ Opposition to Shorten Briefing Schedule\n            and Waive Oral Argument, p. 2). To be sure, sale of the\n            Defensive Appellate Rights may be unhelpful to her in\n            defeating a non-dischargeability claim, but she is in no\n            worse position than if she were permitted to pursue the\n            state court appeal and lost.\n\n      Id. (emphasis added).\n\n            In this case, the opposite is alleged and the Court has already\n      determined that the state court judgment bars further litigation over\n      whether the claim is excepted from discharge. Accordingly, to the\n      extent that the automatic stay bars Saden from pursuing his appeal for\n      the purposes of challenging findings that adversely affect his\n      discharge, the stay is modified.\n\n                                         5\n\f             By modifying the stay, this Court expresses no view on whether\n      the First Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over Saden’s appeal.\n\n      Subject-matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a\n\ncase and is never presumed.

In response, Saden argues that he has\n\nstanding because of the bankruptcy court’s non-dischargeability determination and\n\nbecause of the order that modified the automatic bankruptcy stay.          Thus, in\n\ndetermining our jurisdiction, we must ascertain whether (1) Saden has standing to\n\nappeal the state-court judgment and (2) the assumption of jurisdiction would\n\nviolate the automatic stay.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      While discharge in bankruptcy under Chapter 7 extinguishes a debtor’s\n\npersonal liability for a debt, see Johnson v. Home State Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112617\"><a href=\"/opinion/112617/johnson-v-home-state-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82–83\n\n(1991), a “debtor remains personally responsible for any debt not discharged in\n\nbankruptcy.” In re Cousins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198888\"><a href=\"/opinion/198888/irs-v-cousins/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir. 2000). Here, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s judgment of non-dischargeability—applying bankruptcy law to the state-\n\ncourt judgment—means that despite his bankruptcy filing Saden continues to retain\n\na pecuniary interest in the outcome of this case.       He is personally, actually\n\naggrieved by the trial court’s judgment, which affects the scope of the discharge of\n\nhis liabilities in bankruptcy. See Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 302. Accordingly we\n\nconclude that Saden maintains standing to maintain this appeal despite the pending\n\nbankruptcy proceeding.\n\n      We also have subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the appeal in light of the\n\nbankruptcy court’s modification to the automatic stay of bankruptcy to permit the\n\nparties to prosecute any appeals of the final judgment. Thus, our assumption of\n\njurisdiction in this case does not violate the stay. See Hous. Pipeline Co., 213\n\nS.W.3d at 428–29; see also York, 373 S.W.3d at 38–40.            This modification\n\nnecessarily authorized the filing of postjudgment motions necessary to preserve\n\nissues for appellate review under our procedural rules. See, e.g., TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 324(b). Saden’s timely filed post-judgment motions extended the timeline for\n\nfiling his notice of appeal, which was also timely filed.       See TEX. R. APP.\n\n                                         8\n\fP. 26.1(a).   Saden’s timely filing of a notice of appeal invoked this court’s\n\njurisdiction. See TEX. R. APP. P. 25.1(b).\n\n      We hold that Saden has standing, and we otherwise have jurisdiction over\n\nthis appeal. Accordingly, we deny Smith’s motion to dismiss the appeal.\n\nII.   Saden’s appeal on the merits\n\n      Appellee Brian Smith is the owner of Cash Register Sales and Service of\n\nHouston, Inc., which does business as CRS, Texas. The company was founded by\n\nSmith’s father more than 30 years ago to sell cash registers, and in more recent\n\nyears it sold “point of sale systems” commonly used in restaurants. Appellant\n\nCharles Saden worked as a salesman for a company in the business of processing\n\ncredit card payments. Saden called on CRS, Texas to solicit leads or referrals for\n\ncustomers in 1999, which is when he first met Smith. From 1999 to 2001, Saden\n\nand Smith worked together on such deals, but in 2001 Saden resigned from his job\n\nand approached Smith about forming a new credit card processing company.\n\n      Smith agreed and contributed $10,000 to enable the newly formed company\n\nto pay for an affiliation with National Processing, which would allow the company\n\nto enter the credit card processing market. Smith testified that he did not mind\n\nbeing the only one to contribute money because he knew that Saden was\n\nunemployed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f      Smith testified that they agreed that Saden would run the business. “His\n\nposition would be the president and everything from top to bottom. Obviously, if\n\nit’s just Chuck and I, I was president of CRS, Texas, and that was my full-time job\n\nso Chuck’s responsibility would be to run the company and to make it grow.”\n\nSmith said, “I was to be a silent partner, I was not involved in working there day-\n\nto-day.” But he also said that he brought expertise and experience in the point-of-\n\nsale business to the venture. In particular, Smith’s point-of-sale customers needed\n\ncard processing services, so he brought the potential to generate business by\n\nreferring customers to the new company. Smith said that Saden was bringing\n\n“[h]is experience and knowledge in the credit and processing business. This is\n\nwhat he was experienced in so he was going to facilitate in helping to grow the\n\nPOS Card Processing business.”\n\n      In 2001, Saden and Smith formed and became co-owners in POS Card\n\nProcessing, Inc. POS sold terminals for card processing and facilitated processing\n\nagreements between merchants and banks. It generated revenue by receiving a\n\nfraction of the fees that the bank charged on each card transaction. POS initially\n\nreceived its share of the fees by check and later by direct deposit into a bank\n\naccount.\n\n      Saden and Smith each owned a 50% share of POS, and both were directors\n\nof the company. Smith testified:\n\n                                        10\n\f            From the onset it was a 50/50 deal. We were to be paid\n      equally, the board, me and him, it required us both to agree.\n\n            ....\n\n            I was half owner of the company, and the agreement was we\n      would share equally in the revenues that POS Card Processing\n      generated.\n\n            ....\n\n            We would be paid equally, we were 50 percent owners.\n\n      Saden was appointed president of POS and chairman of the board of\n\ndirectors, and Smith was appointed as secretary and treasurer. They agreed in\n\nwriting that “until further action of the Directors, no Director of the Corporation\n\nshall receive a salary in such capacity” and that the directors and officers were\n\nauthorized to hire and supervise employees and independent contractors to\n\naccomplish the goals of the business. However, Smith testified that he understood\n\nthat they would hire only independent contractors. And the bylaws included the\n\nfollowing provision:\n\n      3.01 Powers. The Directors shall act only as a board and an\n      individual Director shall have no power as such. All corporate powers\n      of the corporation shall be exercised by or under the authority of the\n      Board of Directors and the business and affairs of the corporation\n      shall be controlled by the Board of Directors subject to such\n      limitations as are imposed by law, the articles of incorporation or\n      these Bylaws regarding actions to be authorized or approved by the\n      shareholders. The Board of Directors may by contract or otherwise\n      give general, limited or special power and authority to agents of the\n      corporation to transact any special business requiring such\n      authorization.\n                                        11\n\f      Saden agreed that, as directors, neither he nor Smith could unilaterally enter\n\ninto a management contract. Rather, the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and\n\nminutes of annual meetings indicated that they had to take such actions together as\n\nboard of directors. Smith testified that the arrangement required them “to discuss\n\nand . . . to come to agreements together, not acting independently or separately\n\nfrom each other.” However Saden repeatedly testified that the parties varied their\n\ninitial agreement by later verbal agreements, and that they did not operate the\n\nbusiness in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws. He said,\n\n“Everything about this case is all about verbal agreements . . . .”\n\n      For example, Saden testified that he and Smith had a verbal agreement that\n\nin the first year of POS’s existence, Saden was entitled to all of the profits from the\n\nsale of card processing terminals.       But Smith testified that he never had a\n\nconversation with Saden about his keeping the equipment sales revenue for\n\nhimself. Both Saden and his adult daughter, Charlyn, received salaries from POS.\n\nSaden testified that the board of directors “verbally agreed” to pay the salaries.\n\nBut Smith said they only discussed Charlyn working on commission, not for a\n\nsalary. Smith testified that he first learned during the course of litigation that POS\n\nhad been paying Saden and Charlyn salaries, which Smith called “exorbitant.”\n\nSaden testified that Smith verbally agreed that POS would pay Saden’s expenses\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\ffor attending a trade show. But Smith said that he did not agree to that and that he\n\nexpected Saden to pay his own expenses to attend the show, just as he did.\n\n      POS had a bank account with Klein Bank, which later became Amegy Bank.\n\nInitially, POS received its share of card processing fees by direct deposit into this\n\nbank account. While Smith testified that from 2001 to September 2008, CRS,\n\nTexas exclusively referred its customers to POS for services, Saden testified that\n\nhe had grown frustrated by Smith’s lack of interest and participation in the\n\nbusiness.   Saden testified that CRS, Texas was not referring business and,\n\ntherefore, he was generating the business on his own. So Saden began doing\n\nbusiness separately as “Precision Payment Company,” engaging in exactly the\n\nsame line of business as POS. Saden created a bank account at Klein Bank in his\n\nown name for this purpose.\n\n      From that point on, Saden engaged in a course of action that caused revenue\n\nfrom existing and new POS clients to be deposited in his personal bank account at\n\nKlein Bank. At trial, Saden did not deny that he had engaged in such actions. He\n\nconceded he created fraudulent checks bearing the POS name and his personal\n\nchecking account number. And he conceded that he diverted money that should\n\nhave gone to POS’s bank account into his own account, falsified the POS records\n\nso it would appear that lesser amounts were being deposited into the POS account\n\nfrom bank agents who processed the credit card transactions, and failed to inform\n\n                                         13\n\fSmith of or lied to him about the amount of money that POS was earning. Saden\n\ndid not distribute POS revenue equally. For example, Saden testified that in 2002\n\nhe paid himself $63,000 and paid Smith only $10,000.\n\n      Saden said that, despite his conduct, Smith earned more money than he\n\nwould have under prior business arrangements. He blamed Smith for not being\n\naware of his wrongful conduct.        At trial, Saden was questioned about his\n\n“skimming off the top” of the POS accounts:\n\n      Q.     Did you think that’s something that your business partner\n             would want to know?\n\n      A.     If he wanted to participate and get to know things he could have\n             spent a lot more time involved in the operation, including\n             referring like kind businesses.\n\n      Q.     So, your position is then hey, if he had gotten more involved he\n             would have caught this theft but shame on him for not getting\n             more involved?\n\n      A.     He was secretary-treasurer and he certainly didn’t have an idea\n             of what was going on in the corporation.\n\n      ....\n\n      Q.     You’re not telling the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you\n             told Mr. Smith you were skimming this money off the top, are\n             you?\n\n      A.     I didn’t tell Mr. Smith I was skimming off of the account.\n\n      Q.     You didn’t tell him, hey I’m getting 100 percent over here and\n             I’m going to give 60 percent of that to POS, did you?\n\n      A.     I can’t remember that conversation.\n                                        14\n\f      Q.    Right. But so you would then decide, to use my example, if\n            you got 50 or 60 in one particular month you would then write a\n            check over to POS, put it in their bank account and say 25.\n            Right?\n\n      A.    They got what they deserved.\n\n      Smith testified that he “relied totally” on Saden with respect to his\n\nexpectations of revenue and growth of POS. Early on, he did not review the\n\ncompany’s books. He received monthly checks for what he believed was his\n\nportion of the revenue, but he discovered during the course of litigation that Saden\n\nnever followed the parties’ agreement that both directors would be paid equally.\n\nHe testified that he first learned during the litigation of many of Saden’s actions,\n\nincluding his creation of Precision Payment Company and that he had deposited\n\nPOS money in his personal account. Smith also first learned in litigation that\n\nSaden sold two separate POS account portfolios for far more than he deposited into\n\nPOS accounts or told Smith (one for $92,000 and the other for $286,000, but in\n\neach case the amount actually received by POS was approximately $53,000 to\n\n$54,000).\n\n      Around July 2008, after Smith had sought but not received additional\n\ninformation about the management and finances of the business, he and Saden,\n\nwho was also unhappy with the arrangement, discussed ending the business. They\n\nmet again in September 2008, and Smith asked for an accounting. Saden provided\n\n                                        15\n\fsome information, but he did not give Smith “source information” that would have\n\nshown which processor deposited which amounts at which times. Smith said, “I\n\nthink his attitude was like this is all you’re going to get. I knew we weren’t getting\n\ntoo terribly far with that information. I left with maybe ten pages of printout and\n\nthat was it.”\n\n      Smith ultimately sued Saden for, among other things, breach of contract and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Smith alleged that he was bringing his claims both in his\n\npersonal capacity and in a derivative capacity as a shareholder of POS. He alleged\n\nthat Saden breached a fiduciary duty owed to him personally because POS was\n\noperated as a partnership, the articles of organization and by-laws of POS vested\n\ncontrol of the company in Saden and gave rise to a contractual fiduciary duty, and\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the creation and operation of POS gave rise to a\n\nconfidential relationship between Saden and Smith. As to his personal breach of\n\ncontract claim, Smith alleged that Saden breached his “contractual obligations, and\n\nSmith’s contractual rights, under the several agreements signed by the parties;\n\nincluding without limitation, the articles of organization and the by-laws of POS.”\n\n      The case was tried to a jury. At trial, both Saden and Smith testified, among\n\nother things, about their history of working together, the formation and operation\n\nof POS, and their agreement as to sharing revenue. Smith also presented the\n\ntestimony of Bill Shields, an accountant who analyzed POS and Precision\n\n                                         16\n\faccounting records, including balance sheets, profit and loss statements, general\n\nledgers, and tax records. The accounting spreadsheets that formed the basis for his\n\ntestimony were admitted into evidence. Based on information he received from\n\nSmith, Shields assumed that the parties’ agreement required an equal division of\n\nrevenues, and his analysis did not credit Saden for expenses which were disputed\n\nby Smith. Shields testified that between 2002 and 2008, POS had actual revenue\n\nof $3.77 million, and in addition to that, $2.41 million was diverted from POS to\n\nPrecision.    Shields explained his calculations and the spreadsheets that were\n\nadmitted into evidence at trial. He calculated the amount of money which in his\n\nopinion was due to Smith, based on sharing the revenues but not the disputed\n\nexpenses, and including revenue diverted to other entities that should have accrued\n\nto POS.      Based on his calculations, Shields testified that Saden owed Smith\n\n$941,907. Shields also testified that $941,907 “represents the excess portion of the\n\nincome that was either received by or directed to the benefit of Saden.” He said\n\nthat $941,907 was “solely” what Smith was entitled to receive.\n\n      Shields also testified about the expenses charged to POS. Although POS\n\nhad gross income of $3.77 million, it turned a total profit of only approximately\n\n$4,000 over the relevant years. He explained that the money Saden had paid to\n\nhimself and family members, including personal living expenses, accounted for the\n\nentire difference between the company’s revenue and its profit.\n\n                                        17\n\f         Two causes of action against Saden—breach of contract and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty—were submitted to the jury. The breach of contract questions\n\nasked:\n\n                               QUESTION NO. 1\n\n               Did Brian Smith and Charles Saden agree to equally split the\n         revenues, less reasonable and necessary expenses, derived from the\n         business agreed to be conducted by POS?\n\n               In deciding whether the parties reached an agreement, you may\n         consider what they said and did in light of the surrounding\n         circumstances, including any earlier course of dealing. You may not\n         consider the parties’ unexpressed thoughts or intentions.\n\n               If your answer to Question No. 1 is “Yes,” then answer the\n         following question. Otherwise, do not answer the following question.\n\n                               QUESTION NO. 2\n\n                Did Charles Saden fail to comply with the agreement?\n\n         ....\n\n                               QUESTION NO. 4\n\n                What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly\n         and reasonably compensate Brian Smith for his damages, if any, that\n         resulted from Charles Saden’s failure to comply with the agreement?\n\n               Lost profits that are a natural, probable, and foreseeable\n         consequence of Chuck Saden’s failure to comply with the agreement.\n\n         Answer in dollars and cents if any.\n\nSaden objected to Question No. 1 on the grounds that there was no evidence of\n\nreasonable and necessary expenses and there was no definition of reasonable and\n                                           18\n\fnecessary expenses. The trial court overruled both objections. Neither party\n\nobjected to questions 2 or 4.\n\n      The relevant breach of fiduciary duty questions asked:\n\n                                QUESTION NO. 8\n\n           Did Charles Saden comply with his fiduciary duties to Brian\n      Smith?\n\n            Because a relationship of trust and confidence existed between\n      them, Charles Saden owed Brian Smith a fiduciary duty. To prove he\n      complied with his duty, Charles Saden must show:\n\n             a. The transactions in question were fair and equitable to Brian\n                Smith;\n\n             b. Charles Saden made reasonable use of the confidence that\n                Brian Smith placed in him;\n\n             c. Charles Saden acted in the utmost good faith and exercised\n                the most scrupulous honesty toward Brian Smith;\n\n             d. Charles Saden placed the interests of Brian Smith before his\n                own, did not use the advantage of his position to gain any\n                benefit for himself at the expense of Brian Smith, and did\n                not place himself in any position where his self-interest\n                might conflict with his obligations as a fiduciary; and\n\n             e. Charles Saden fully and fairly disclosed all important\n                information to Brian Smith concerning the transactions.\n\n      ....\n\n            If your answer to Question No. 8 is “No,” then answer the\n      following question. Otherwise do not answer the following question.\n\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f                        QUESTION NO. 10\n\n       What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly\nand reasonably compensate Brian Smith for his damages, if any, that\nwere proximately caused by Charles Saden’s failure to comply with\nhis fiduciary duties to Brian Smith?\n\n“Proximate cause” has two parts:\n\n1. A proximate cause is a substantial factor that in a natural and\n   continuous sequence brings about an event and without which the\n   event would not have occurred; and\n\n2. A proximate cause is foreseeable. “Foreseeable” means that a\n   person using ordinary care would have reasonably anticipated that\n   his acts or failure to act would have caused the event or some\n   similar event.\n\nThere may be more than one proximate cause of an event.\n\n        Consider the following elements of damages, if any, and none\nother. You shall not award any sum of money on any element if you\nhave otherwise, under some other element, awarded a sum of money\nfor the same loss. That is, do not compensate for the same loss twice,\nif any.\n\n       Lost profits that are a natural, probable, and foreseeable\nconsequence of Chuck Saden’s failure to comply with his fiduciary\nduties to Brian Smith.\n\n....\n\n      If your answer to Question No. 8 is “No,” then answer the\nfollowing question. Otherwise, do not answer the following question.\n\n                        QUESTION NO. 11\n\n       What was the amount of Charles Saden’s profit from the\nconduct, if any, that you have found to be a breach of Charles Saden’s\nfiduciary duties to Brian Smith?\n                                   20\n\fSmith objected to the omission of separate questions pertaining to his derivative\n\nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, and he requested their inclusion. The trial\n\ncourt denied these requests. Saden made the following objections to questions 8,\n\n10, and 11:\n\n      Defense counsel: Defendants also object to Question No. 8 in the\n                       jury charge.       The existence—first of all,\n                       defendants object to the inclusion of an informal\n                       fiduciary duty because there is no evidence of a\n                       confidential relationship that predates the POS\n                       transaction and for that reason we don’t believe\n                       there should be an informal fiduciary duty\n                       question.\n\n      Court:            Overruled.\n\n      Defense counsel: To the extent that it is included we do require—we\n                       object to the extent there is no language to support\n                       or there isn’t a definition given to [the] jury that\n                       the relationship must have existed prior to and\n                       separate from the transaction giving rise to the\n                       alleged breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n      Court:            Overruled.\n\n      Defense counsel: And we would like to submit our proposed\n                       Question No. 8—actually, 8 should have been with\n                       regard to my last question. I apologize, Your\n                       Honor.\n\n      Court:            Well, whatever.\n\n      Defense counsel: I’m guessing the last one should have been with\n                       regard to this. And, I’ll go ahead and on the same\n                       basis we object to Question No. 9, 10, 11, 12 again\n                       on the basis there is no evidence of written formal\n                                       21\n\f                            fiduciary duty or        relationship—confidential\n                            relationship of trust.\n\n          Court:            Overruled, overruled, overruled, overruled.\n\n          The jury found that Smith and Saden had an agreement, which only Saden\n\nhad breached. It also found that Saden did not comply with his fiduciary duties.\n\nThe jury awarded damages in the following amounts: (1) $941,907 for breach of\n\ncontract, (2) $393,093 for breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) $941,907 for Saden’s\n\nprofit from the conduct found to be a breach of his fiduciary duties. Smith moved\n\nfor entry of judgment on the verdict, for a turnover, and for permanent injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n          The trial court rendered judgment for (1) $941,907 for breach of contract,\n\nplus attorney’s fees of $465,173.27 (and contingent appellate attorney’s fees in the\n\naggregate amount of $125,000) and prejudgment interest in the amount of\n\n$91,255.35; (2) $393,093 for breach of fiduciary duty, plus prejudgment interest in\n\nthe amount of $38,090.24; and (3) $941,907 for equitable disgorgement of profits\n\n“found by the jury to have been obtained by [Saden] as a result of his acts of fraud,\n\ndefalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary capacity with\n\nrespect to [Smith],” plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $91,255.35. The\n\njudgment also characterized the assets in possession of the receiver as having been\n\n“received or obtained as a result of Defendant, Charles R. Saden’s acts of fraud,\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fdefalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary capacity to\n\nPlaintiff, Brian Smith.”\n\n      Saden raises four issues on appeal. In his first issue, Saden argues that\n\nSmith, in his individual capacity, lacked standing to pursue the claims pleaded\n\nagainst Saden for damages related to POS. Second, Saden contends that Smith\n\nshould have been required to elect a remedy instead of recovering duplicative\n\ndamages for lost profits. Third, Saden challenges Smith’s recovery for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty because no question on the existence of a duty was submitted to the\n\njury and because there was no preexisting special relationship sufficient to support\n\na finding of an informal fiduciary duty. Finally, in his fourth issue Saden asks this\n\ncourt to reform the judgment to eliminate language not supported by any jury\n\nfinding, specifically the judgment’s reference to fraud, defalcation, and\n\nembezzlement.\n\n      A.     Smith’s standing\n\n      Smith’s original petition included causes of action for breach of contract and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Saden challenges Smith’s standing as a 50% shareholder\n\nof POS to individually recover the company’s lost profits pursuant to those claims.\n\nAs noted above, standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot be\n\nwaived, and it is never presumed. See Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 443–44;\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d at 553–54. Smith had standing to assert the causes of action\n\n                                         23\n\fsubmitted to the jury if he raised “an actual, not merely a hypothetical or\n\ngeneralized grievance.” Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 302.\n\n      Saden relies on Wingate v. Hajdik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369002\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369002/wingate-v-hajdik/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1990), for the\n\nproposition that Smith cannot recover personally for damages incurred by a\n\ncorporation of which he is a shareholder. In that case, the Supreme Court of Texas\n\nheld that “[a] corporate stockholder cannot recover damages personally for a\n\nwrong done solely to the corporation, even though he may be injured by that\n\nwrong.” Wingate, 795 S.W.3d at 719. A shareholder may nevertheless recover\n\ndamages “for wrongs done to him individually” when he pleads and proves that the\n\ndefendant has violated a duty that he owed the shareholder, which arises from\n\ncontract or otherwise. Id.\n\n      Saden filed special exceptions arguing that “the essence of Smith’s\n\nallegations is to vindicate for wrongs allegedly done to POS, as opposed to wrongs\n\ndirected at Smith individually.” The trial court denied the special exceptions, and\n\nSmith later amended his petition, specifically pleading that he was alleging various\n\ncauses of action—including breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty—as\n\nboth individual and derivative claims. Specifically, Smith alleged a claim for a\n\npersonal breach of contract based on “contractual obligations, and Smith’s\n\ncontractual rights, under the several agreements signed by the parties; including\n\nwithout limitation, the articles of organization and the by-laws of POS.” Smith\n\n                                        24\n\falso alleged that Saden breached a fiduciary duty owed to him personally because\n\nof the circumstances surrounding the creation and operation of POS which\n\nallegedly created a confidential relationship between them.\n\n      At trial, there was evidence that Smith and Saden—the sole directors,\n\nofficers, and shareholders of the corporation—agreed to split the revenues from\n\nPOS equally.      There was also evidence of the factual circumstances of the\n\nrelationship between Saden and Smith prior to the formation of POS.\n\n      At the charge conference, Smith sought to include jury questions on his\n\nderivative claims and the court refused his requests. Saden does not challenge\n\nSmith’s standing to bring a derivative claim, and the only apparent basis for the\n\ntrial court’s failure to separately submit questions on the derivative claims stems\n\nfrom the fact that POS was a closely held corporation. See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE\n\nANN. § 21.563(a) (West 2012). If justice requires, a court may treat a derivative\n\nproceeding brought by a shareholder of a closely held corporation as if it were a\n\ndirect action brought by the shareholder for the shareholder’s own benefit. Id.\n\n§ 21.563(c)(1).    Smith met these criteria and therefore the trial court was\n\nauthorized to act as it did, treating his derivative claim as a direct claim.\n\n      We hold that Smith had standing to assert his claims, whether individually or\n\nderivatively, and we overrule Saden’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\f        B.    Breach of fiduciary duty\n\n        Saden argues that Smith cannot recover for breach of fiduciary duty because\n\nany duty was owed to the corporation, no duty question was submitted to the jury,\n\nand there was no pre-existing special relationship to support an informal fiduciary\n\nduty.\n\n        We again note the special circumstances applicable to a closely held\n\ncorporation. Smith pleaded his claims both in his individual capacity and also\n\nderivatively on behalf of the closely held corporation. The evidence conclusively\n\nestablished that POS was a closely held corporation and that Smith was one of its\n\ntwo 50% shareholders. Accordingly, the trial court was authorized to treat the\n\nderivative claims as individual claims. See id. Moreover, “a recovery in a direct\n\nor derivative proceeding by a shareholder may be paid directly to the plaintiff or to\n\nthe corporation if necessary to protect the interests of creditors or other\n\nshareholders of the corporation.” Id. § 21.563(c)(2); Swank v.

App.—Eastland 2008, pet. denied). Saden devotes his\n\nbriefing on this issue to the lack of jury findings that a relationship of trust and\n\nconfidence existed between Saden and Smith before the formation of POS. In his\n\nbrief, Saden argues about Smith’s failure to secure jury findings that there was “a\n\npre-existing special or fiduciary relationship.” He notes that the trial court denied\n\nhis motion for directed verdict, in which he argued, “The evidence has shown they\n\n                                         26\n\fhad no relationship whatsoever before they met with regard to the POS venture.”\n\nHe also notes his objection to jury question no. 8 on the basis that there was no\n\nevidence of “a confidential relationship that predates the POS transaction.”\n\n      Question No. 8 presupposed the existence of a fiduciary duty, and asked,\n\n“Did Charles Saden comply with his fiduciary duties to Brian Smith?” There is no\n\nquestion that as an officer of POS, Saden owed a fiduciary duty to the corporation\n\nas a matter of law. See, e.g., Int’l Bankers Life Ins. Co. v. Holloway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1532508\"><a href=\"/opinion/1532508/international-bankers-life-ins-co-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (Tex. 1963). Because POS was a close corporation and Smith was one of\n\nits shareholders, the trial court was authorized to allow Smith to pursue his\n\nderivative claim on behalf of POS as if it were his own. See TEX. BUS. ORGS.\n\nCODE ANN. § 21.563(c)(1) & (2). Smith does not contest that sufficient evidence\n\nsupports the jury’s answer to Question No. 8 regarding breach. Because Smith\n\nowed a fiduciary duty as a matter of law, the trial court did not err in submitting\n\nthis claim to the jury. The jury’s finding of a breach of fiduciary duty was\n\nsupported by the evidence.\n\n      In an attempt to avoid the application of section 21.563(c), Saden primarily\n\nrelies upon Guerra v.

In an alternative holding, the court suggested that\n\neven if the individual claimants had been shareholders, the trial court acted within\n\nits discretion by declining to allow them to pursue derivative claims in their\n\nindividual capacities and for their own benefit because they only claimed to own\n\n40% of the company and the record reflected “substantial and longstanding\n\ndisputes” between them and the majority shareholder, which would have required\n\nthat any recovery for the company would have to be paid to the company to protect\n\nthe majority shareholder’s interest. Id. at 664–66. The factual circumstances of\n\nSmith’s pursuit of derivative claims on behalf of POS do not share the\n\ncharacteristics that led the Swank court to observe, in dicta, that the trial judge\n\nwould have acted in his discretion to refuse to authorize individual shareholders to\n\npursue derivative claims. See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 21.563(c)(1).\n\n      Because Saden and Smith are the only shareholders of POS, the injury\n\nsuffered by the corporation is the injury suffered by Smith as 50% shareholder to\n\nthe extent it inured to the other 50% shareholder’s benefit. Considering that Smith\n\nwas the only shareholder injured by Saden’s wrongful conduct (while Saden\n\nhimself, as the only other shareholder, benefited from it), the recovery could be\n\npaid to Smith directly to protect his interests.\n\n                                           29\n\f      We therefore overrule the challenge to the liability finding on the claim for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\n\n      C.     Election of remedies\n\n      Saden argues that the trial court erred in awarding Smith duplicative\n\ndamages and that Smith was required to elect a remedy. Specifically Saden objects\n\nto the cumulative award of three separate measures of profits as actual damages for\n\nbreach of contract, actual damages for breach of fiduciary duty, and for equitable\n\ndisgorgement as a further remedy for breach of fiduciary duty. Saden raised this\n\nissue in a post-trial motion to modify, correct, or reform the judgment, which the\n\ntrial court denied. In this context, we review the trial court’s judgment for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Beaumont Bank, N.A. v.

When a defendant’s acts result in a single injury, and the jury returns\n\nfavorable findings on more than one theory of liability, the plaintiff is entitled to\n\njudgment on the theory affording him the greatest relief. See Birchfield, 747\n\nS.W.2d at 367; Madison, 241 S.W.3d at 158–59.\n\n      In order to answer the question of whether an election of remedies was\n\nrequired in this case, it is therefore necessary to carefully review the record to\n\ndetermine whether the claimant supported alternate theories of liability with\n\nevidence indicating separate and distinct injuries resulting in separate and distinct\n\ndamages. In this case, the jury was asked to quantify “profits” in three different\n\nquestions: in question no. 4 (breach of contract lost-profits damages), in question\n\n                                         31\n\fno. 10 (breach of fiduciary duty lost-profits damages), and in question no. 11\n\n(equitable disgorgement of profits). Questions 4 and 10 specifically instructed the\n\njury to award only “lost profits,” if any, defined in each case as the “natural,\n\nprobable, and foreseeable consequence” of Saden’s failure to comply with his\n\ncontractual or fiduciary duty. While “[r]ecovery for lost profits does not require\n\nthat the loss be susceptible of exact calculation,” the amount of lost profits “must\n\nbe shown by competent evidence with reasonable certainty.” Holt Atherton Indus.,\n\nInc. v.

There were many questions about the sums of\n\nmoney generated as a result of POS business and whether the money was deposited\n\nin the POS account or a Precision account, whether the money was split evenly,\n\nand whether Saden used the money for his personal use. There were also questions\n\nabout expenses and what or whether POS expenses were paid by money kept in the\n\nPrecision account. And Smith was asked about the nature of the injury that he\n\n                                         32\n\fsuffered as a result of the actions alleged in this lawsuit. Smith said, “I as a\n\nshareholder, owner of POS Card Processing was deprived of any income that I\n\nshould have received out of the profits that were earned by POS Card Processing,\n\nso the company was damaged, and I was damaged.” Smith testified that “the\n\nreduction of the value to POS” was “was the primary reason” he was “damaged\n\nindividually.”\n\n      To prove his damages at trial, Smith presented the testimony of Bill Shields,\n\nan accountant who analyzed the records of POS and Precision. Shields relied on\n\ncertain assumptions in determining the amount of money Saden owed Smith.\n\nBasing his analysis on Smith’s version of events, he assumed that the men agreed\n\nto share the company’s revenue equally but did not agree to all of the expenses\n\nincurred by Saden and charged to POS.          Thus, Shields did not consider as\n\nreasonable and necessary business expenses the money that Saden spent on salaries\n\nfor him and his relatives or the expenses that otherwise personally benefited Saden\n\n(such as traveling and meals). Shields included as part of the revenue that should\n\nhave accrued to POS under the agreement $2.41 million that was diverted from\n\nPOS to Precision. He testified that based on his analysis, Saden owed Smith\n\n“solely” $941,907, explaining that this amount “represents the excess portion of\n\nthe income that was either received by or directed to the benefit of Saden.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         33\n\f      As was the case in Madison v. Williamson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872558\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872558/madison-v-williamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied), Smith made no attempt in the trial court to\n\ndistinguish between the damages he suffered as a result of Saden’s breach of\n\ncontract and his breach of fiduciary duty. Instead, Smith presented a unified\n\ndamages model through the testimony of Shields, who explained that he included\n\nthe elements of self-dealing that were apparent from the accounting records in\n\ndetermining the distributions that Smith should have received from POS. There\n\nwas no attempt to segregate damages attributable to breach of the parties’\n\nagreement from any other damages that somehow may have been attributable to\n\nseparate disloyal acts in breach of Smith’s fiduciary duty. Moreover, the evidence\n\nat trial did not clearly show two separate injuries in this regard. Rather, it showed\n\ngenerally that Saden diverted revenue to himself and failed to evenly divide what\n\nrevenue was actually received by POS.         The expert testimony indicated that\n\nSmith’s share of the POS proceeds, which Shields calculated to be $941,907, was\n\neffectively the same as the profit Saden wrongfully obtained by breaching his\n\nfiduciary duty.\n\n      In his appellate brief, Smith contends that the separate awards for breach of\n\ncontract and breach of fiduciary duty are supported by the record, arguing:\n\n      The contract damages were limited to that portion of the fifty percent\n      (50%) of the business profits that were not paid to Smith by Saden,\n      whereas the fiduciary breach damages were, inter alia, caused by\n      Smith’s [a] failure to secure the best price possible for the POS\n                                         34\n\f      accounts that he secretly sold; [b] failure to secure commission rates\n      for POS equal to those he secured for himself; [c] sale of POS\n      accounts and equipment; [d] theft of $200,000 in certificates of\n      deposit; [e] use of POS funds to pay personal living expenses for\n      himself and his family; [f] theft of POS funds after the appointment of\n      the Receiver; and [g] enriching himself through a series of self-\n      dealing transactions. The damages caused by Saden’s breach of his\n      fiduciary duty were different from, and not part of, the contract\n      damages because they were of a nature that they did not cause an\n      unequal division of the profits from the business.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 27–28 (footnotes omitted); see also Dissent at 7.\n\n      We disagree.     First, there is significant overlap between this litany of\n\nSaden’s misdeeds and the misconduct documented and accounted for in the Shields\n\ndamages model, which represented “the excess portion of the income that was\n\neither received by or directed to the benefit of Saden.” For example, Shields’s\n\ncalculations expressly accounted for acts of corporate waste, most significantly\n\nincluding the “use of POS funds to pay personal living expenses for himself and\n\nhis family” in that his analysis did not treat those expenses as reasonable and\n\nnecessary corporate expenses, but instead treated $1,379,369 of expenses paid by\n\nPOS as “Distributions to/for the benefit of C. Saden.” Likewise, to the extent that\n\nSmith’s reference to “enriching himself through a series of self-dealing\n\ntransactions” is also a reference to the payment of Saden’s living expenses with\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fPOS funds, as strongly suggested by a footnote in Smith’s brief,1 that category also\n\nis incorporated into the Shields damages model. Finally in this regard, Smith’s\n\nreference to the “theft of $200,000 in certificates of deposit” is not further\n\nsupported or explained with any citation to the record, but it apparently refers to a\n\nCD that Saden testified that he purchased from the Precision account with funds\n\n1\n      In Smith’s appellee’s brief, the reference to Saden “enriching himself\n      through a series of self-dealing transactions” is followed by a footnote,\n      which reads:\n\n             In fact, Shields, the accounting expert, allowed for $1,600,000\n             in expenses in computing the contract damages, even though\n             many of those payments were to or for self-dealing transactions\n             for the benefit of Saden and his family (e.g., meals, insurance\n             and utilities including, gas, water, electricity and other\n             expenses). See PX 301. Although those payments are not\n             included in Smith’s contract damages, but they are tort damages\n             in Smith’s breach of fiduciary duty claim, and they far exceed\n             the $393,093.00 found by the jury. Kinzbach Tool Co. v\n             Corbett-Wallace Corp., S.W.2d 509, 512–14 (Tex. 1942).\n\n      Appellee’s Brief at 28 n.42. Though the source of the $1,600,000 figure is\n      unexplained, to the extent Smith argues that the Shields model did not\n      include payments “for the benefit of Saden and his family (e.g., meals,\n      insurance and utilities including, gas, water, electricity and other expenses),”\n      he plainly misstates the record. The examination and cross-examination of\n      Shields made quite clear that between POS and Precision, Shields\n      determined that Saden “paid himself through either salary, commissions,\n      benefits, personal expenses, home expense, whatever it may be,\n      $2,740,927.” Of this amount, the only expenses that Shields treated as\n      legitimate business expenses were commissions and director fees. The\n      Shields damages model accounts for payments made for the benefit of Saden\n      and his family, and it compensates Smith for his injury to the extent the\n      revenues of POS and Precision were not evenly split between him and Saden\n      as a result of such payments.\n\n                                         36\n\fthat were obtained from the sale of POS accounts. The Shields analysis includes\n\n$1,188,846 of distributions from Precision for the benefit of Saden, and while the\n\nrecord evidence does not include detailed individual transactions supporting that\n\nfigure, it does show total amounts of distributions broken down by year in amounts\n\nranging from $65,061 in 2004 to $397,995 in 2007. There is no evidence to\n\nsuggest that Saden’s purchase of a $200,000 certificate of deposit from Precision\n\nfunds for his own benefit is not included in Shields’s calculation of $1,188,846 of\n\ndistributions to Saden from Precision.\n\n      Second, the record reveals no competent evidence from which a fact finder\n\ncould determine with reasonable certainty the amount of lost profits separately\n\nattributable only to breach of contract or only to breach of fiduciary duty. See Holt\n\nAtherton, 835 S.W.2d at 84. The only element of damages listed in questions 4\n\nand 10 was “lost profits.” The charge instructed the jury to consider that element\n\nof damages, “if any, and none other.” Neither party objected to the lost-profits\n\nlanguage in the charge, and neither party requested a different or additional\n\nmeasure of damages be submitted to the jury.\n\n      The jury awarded the full measure of lost profits supported by the\n\naccountant’s testimony as contract damages: $941,907. It may have been possible\n\nto categorize Saden’s various bad acts between breaches of contract and other\n\nseparate breaches of fiduciary duty, and then to quantify lost profits or other\n\n                                         37\n\fdamages attributable to each so as to identify separate injuries leading to separate\n\namounts of damages. But as this case was presented, tried, and charged to the jury,\n\nthe actual evidence of injury and lost profits did not show separate and distinct\n\ninjuries resulting in separate and distinct lost profits. See Madison, 241 S.W.3d at\n\n158. Smith’s damages model showed that he suffered one injury: he was deprived\n\nof all the money he was due from POS because of the various faithless actions\n\ntaken in violation of the parties’ agreement and Saden’s fiduciary duties.\n\n      To the extent Smith suggests that other lost profits may have been\n\nattributable to other bad acts not addressed by the Shields analysis, his brief has\n\npointed us to no such evidence in the record, and our own review has found none.\n\nSmith’s brief points to no evidence of any value—much less a valuation that would\n\nsatisfy Holt Atherton—assigned to the lost profits attributable to Saden’s “failure\n\nto secure the best price possible for the POS accounts that he secretly sold,”\n\n“failure to secure commission rates for POS equal to those he secured for himself,”\n\n“sale of POS accounts and equipment” (other than the purchase of the $200,000\n\ncertificate of deposit apparently included in Shields’s calculation of distributions\n\nfrom Precision to Saden), or “theft of POS funds after the appointment of the\n\nReceiver.” See Appellee’s Brief at 28.\n\n      In sum, Smith demonstrated his entitlement to a unified recovery for one\n\nbroadly described injury with one damages model sponsored by accountant\n\n                                         38\n\fShields. See id. Accordingly, Smith failed to justify separate awards for alternate\n\ntheories of liability, as the theories as presented at trial did not depend on separate\n\nand distinct injuries resulting in separate and distinct damages. See Madison, 241\n\nS.W.3d at 158.      Under such circumstances, allowing the recovery of actual\n\ndamages for both breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty violates the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule, and is therefore error. See, e.g., Downer, 701 S.W.2d at 241–42.\n\n      We reach a different conclusion with respect to the award of equitable\n\ndisgorgement of profits. Question no. 11, the basis for the equitable forfeiture\n\naward, was predicated on the liability question for breach of fiduciary duty, and it\n\nwas phrased in terms of the “profit” Saden obtained by his tortious conduct.\n\nNevertheless, equitable forfeiture is distinguishable from an award of actual\n\ndamages, in that it serves a separate function of protecting fiduciary relationships.\n\nERI Consulting Eng’rs, Inc. v. Swinnea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895225\"><a href=\"/opinion/895225/eri-consulting-engineers-inc-v-swinnea/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874 (Tex. 2010). Even if\n\na fiduciary does not obtain a benefit by violating his duty, he still may be required\n\nto forfeit the right to compensation for his work. Id. at 873 (citing Burrow v. Arce,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419918\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419918/burrow-v-arce/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (Tex. 1999)). Saden did not present any legal challenge to\n\nthe amount of the equitable disgorgement award, so we express no opinion about\n\nthe measure of the equitable remedy awarded. Instead, Saden only challenges the\n\naward on the basis that it is duplicative of the other awards of damages, in\n\nviolation of the one-satisfaction rule. We hold that the one-satisfaction rule does\n\n                                          39\n\fnot preclude the recovery of both actual damages and the equitable remedy of\n\ndisgorgement of profits, as these remedies are intended to address separate and\n\ndistinct injuries. Cf. ERI Consulting, 318 S.W.3d at 882 (remanding case for\n\nfurther proceedings on both equitable disgorgement and lost-profits awards).\n\n      We sustain Saden’s issue in part and hold that on the facts of this case, the\n\ntrial court erred in rendering judgment that permitted duplicative recovery of actual\n\nlost-profit damages for both breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. We\n\noverrule Saden’s issue to the extent that he argues that the one-satisfaction rule\n\ndisallows an award of both actual damages and the equitable remedy of\n\ndisgorgement of profits. Ordinarily we would reform the judgment to effect an\n\nelection of the remedy that affords the prevailing party the greatest relief. See, e.g.,\n\nStar Houston, Inc. v. Shevack, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529271\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529271/star-houston-inc-v-shevack/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423 (Tex.

However, this\n\ncase is complicated by the fact of Saden’s bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court’s\n\norder of non-dischargeability. Because it is not readily apparent from the appellate\n\nrecord which theory of liability Smith would elect, we will remand to permit Smith\n\nto make an election.\n\n      D.     Findings of fraud, defalcation, embezzlement\n\n      In his fourth issue, Saden argues that the court erred by including recovery\n\nand findings on issues that were not submitted to the jury or conclusively\n\n                                          40\n\festablished. Specifically, Saden objects to the inclusion of language stating that he\n\ncommitted “acts of fraud, defalcation and embezzlement while acting and serving\n\nin a fiduciary capacity.” Saden also specifically objects to the following language\n\non page 4 of the trial court’s judgment:\n\n      The Court finds that all of the business and assets that are currently in\n      the Receiver’s possession, custody and control belong to POS, that\n      any such assets that are currently in the Receiver’s possession,\n      custody and control belong to POS, that any such assets received or\n      obtained by, or in the name of Defendants Charles R. Saden or\n      Precision Payments Company were received or obtained as a result of\n      Defendant, Charles R. Saden’s acts of fraud, defalcation and\n      embezzlement while acting and serving in a fiduciary capacity to\n      Plaintiff, Brian Smith.\n\nSaden’s complaint appears to be two-fold, that: (1) the court erred by including in\n\nthe judgment findings of “fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement” that were not\n\nsubmitted to the jury and that Smith relied upon in the bankruptcy court to argue\n\nfor an order of non-dischargeability of the debt, and (2) the court erred by making\n\na determination regarding the assets that were then in the Receiver’s possession.\n\n      An issue must be submitted to the jury when it is (1) raised by the pleadings\n\nand the evidence, (2) disputed, and (3) properly requested.

Crim. App. 1940); see TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 32.45\n\n(West 2011) (misapplication of fiduciary property or property of financial\n\ninstitution).\n\n\n\n\n                                        43\n\f        Smith did not raise in his pleadings the issues of whether Saden committed\n\nacts of fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement. Nor did he request a jury question\n\non these issues. Comparing the elements of fraud, defalcation, and embezzlement\n\nto the jury charge, we conclude that not all of the elements of fraud, defalcation,\n\nand embezzlement were submitted to the jury. Accordingly, we hold that the trial\n\ncourt erred by including this language in the judgment, and we sustain this issue in\n\npart.\n\n        Finally, we consider Saden’s challenge regarding the portion of the\n\njudgment concerning the assets in the receiver’s possession. The court appointed a\n\nreceiver in February 2009, and the receiver took possession of POS along with the\n\nentities Saden created and used to divert POS revenues. Section 11.403 of the\n\nBusiness Organizations Code provides: “The court appointing a receiver under this\n\nsection has and shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over the specific property placed\n\nin receivership. The court shall determine the rights of the parties in the property\n\nor its proceeds.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 11.403(c) (West 2012). Here, the\n\njudgment noted that the trial court lacked authority to dispose of the property held\n\nby the receiver due to the automatic bankruptcy stay and ordered the future\n\ndelivery of the assets held by the receiver to the bankruptcy trustee.\n\n        Saden argues, without citation to authority, that “[t]he jury did not make any\n\nfindings about POS assets, nor was it asked anything about Precision Payment\n\n                                          44\n\fCompany or Hohen-Saden, LLC. The jury was asked about damages, not these\n\nissues of ownership or entitlement, and to make any such award or finding here\n\nwould also be a duplicative recovery.” But this particular aspect of the final\n\njudgment does not award a duplicative recovery: it defers determination of the\n\nownership of the assets held by the receiver to the bankruptcy court. We hold that\n\nthe court did not err in doing so.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the trial court’s judgment to the extent that it permitted\n\nduplicative recovery of damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and included additional unauthorized findings that Saden committed acts of\n\n“fraud,” “defalcation,” and “embezzlement,” and we remand to the trial court to\n\nallow Smith to elect a remedy and for entry of a new judgment, which does not\n\ninclude language purporting to make findings based on fraud, defalcation, or\n\nembezzlement.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Michael Massengale\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Jennings, Bland, and Massengale.\n\nJustice Jennings, dissenting.\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f46\n\f</pre>",
