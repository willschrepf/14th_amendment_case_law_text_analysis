Attorneys' Fees Incurred by The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\n       George Fleming (\"Fleming\") bases his Brief of Cross-Appellee\n\nprimarily on the argument that defendants The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.,\n\nCharles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin defended themselves pro\n\nse, and that because they defended themselves pro se, they didn't \"incur\" any\n\nattorneys' fees as is required by the TCPA. This argument is correct in the\n\ncase of defendants Charles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin, but\n\nit's incorrect in the case of defendant The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\n       In Texas, a corporation cannot defend itself pro se.1 It must be\n\nrepresented by a licensed attorney,2 and a corporation cannot be a licensed\n\nattorney. In this case, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. was represented by\n\nCharles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin (all licensed attorneys),\n\nand it offered undisputed evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred\n\nattorneys' fees to them:\n\n       The reasonable, usual and customary value of the reasonable\n       and necessary legal services of Charles Kirklin, Stephen R.\n\n1\n  Dell Dev.

For example,\n\n\n\n\n3\n  1 RR 92 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) (emphasis added)\n4\n  1 RR 92 - 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) (emphasis added)\n5\n  1 RR @ 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n6\n  See, for example, 1 RR 107 (March 30, 2015 Hearing); 1 RR 36 (March 30, 2015\nHearing) @ 14 – 17; 1 RR 39 (March 30, 2015 Hearing ) @ 12 – 14; 1 RR 41 – 42\n(March 30, 2015 Hearing); 1 RR 44 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) @ 16 – 18; 1 RR 44 – 45\n(March 30, 2015 Hearing); 1 RR 45 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n7\n  1 RR 58 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n                                                                         6|Page\n\fin the American Heritage Capital case, a litigant offered the following\n\naffidavit evidence from the representing attorney:\n\n        My services and the services of [his firm] were and are\n        necessary and the expenses incurred are reasonable in that\n        Plaintiff ... filed suit against Defendants and it was reasonable\n        and necessary for Defendants to retain legal counsel to\n        represent and defend them in this action, as well as to assert\n        their statutory rights under the Texas Anti-SLAPP statute....8\n\nThe court held that this was evidence that the litigants incurred attorneys'\n\nfees:\n\n        To this evidence we may add [the attorney's] subsequent\n        description of the legal work he and others actually performed\n        on the case and the existence of the invoices directed to [the\n        litigants]. The evidence, viewed as a whole, gives rise to a\n        reasonable inference that [the litigants] did in fact \"retain,\" i.e.,\n        make an agreement to pay, [the attorney and his firm] for their\n        legal services.\n\n        We also agree...that the evidence adequately supports the\n        proposition that [the litigant] also incurred liability for and paid\n        for the legal services of [the attorney and his firm]. In his\n        affidavit, [the attorney] explains what services were performed\n        by members of his law firm, how much time was spent on those\n        services, and what the relevant hourly rates were. Coupled with\n        his previous testimony indicating that [the litigants] retained\n        [the attorney and his firm] to furnish those services, [the\n        attorney's] testimony is some evidence that [the litigant]\n        actually incurred—became liable to pay—fees for those\n        services.9\n\n\n\n8\n  Am. Heritage Capital, LP v. Gonzalez, 436 S.W.3d 865, 878 (Tex.

He also failed to offer any evidence that would\n\nprove otherwise. Thus, the evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nincurred attorneys' fees stands unrebutted.\n\n       Even if the Kirklin Defendants had not submitted the foregoing\n\nevidence, the Texas Supreme Court has held that trial courts can infer that\n\nattorneys' fees were incurred from circumstantial evidence:\n\n       The record reflects...that services were performed on the\n       doctor's behalf. The attorney filed an answer, a plea in\n       abatement, a motion to dismiss, and a notice of appeal. The\n       attorney also appeared, argued, and gave testimony regarding\n\n10\n   1 RR 94 – 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n11\n   Id.\n12\n   Id.\n                                                                      8|Page\n\f         the motion to dismiss. While there is no evidence about what\n         Dr. Garcia (or perhaps his insurance carrier) agreed to pay for\n         these services, it blinks reality to assume that the attorney was a\n         volunteer or that Dr. Garcia did not incur attorney's fees for this\n         work.... Because there is some evidence in this case that\n         attorney's fees were both incurred and reasonable, the trial court\n         should have awarded attorney's fees to Dr. Garcia.13\n\n         In this case, there is direct evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nincurred attorneys' fees as explained above, but there is also plenty of\n\ncircumstantial evidence from which attorneys' fees can be inferred as well.\n\nJust as in the Garcia case, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.'s attorneys filed an\n\nanswer, a motion to dismiss, and took other actions on behalf of their client.\n\nAccording to the Garcia case, this circumstantial evidence alone is evidence\n\nthat The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees.\n\n         The $53,950 in attorneys' fees sought by The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nis a reasonable amount. Charles Kirklin testified in support of these\n\nattorneys' fees in detail, and the trial court held that \"$53,950 appears to me\n\nto be a reasonable and necessary fee.\"14 Nevertheless, the trial court\n\nawarded the Kirklin Defendants zero in attorneys' fees at the trial level.\n\n         This was an abuse of discretion because Texas courts have held that\n\nwhen a case is dismissed under the TCPA, if any attorneys' fees were\n\n\n\n13\n     Garcia v.

App.—Dallas June\n23, 2015, pet. filed)\n                                                                       10 | P a g e\n\f         The plain language of section 27.009(a)(1) mandates that\n         appellants, as successful movants for dismissal, are entitled to\n         an award of reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses\n         incurred in defending against the action that is supported by the\n         evidence. See Cruz, 452 S.W.3d at 522. While the statute\n         affords the trial court discretion to adjust downward\n         reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in\n         defending against the action as justice and equity may\n         require, the statute does not afford discretion to award no\n         attorney's fees and other expenses when the amount of\n         reasonable fees and other expenses incurred in defending\n         against the action are supported by record evidence. See\n         Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 27.009(a)(1). On this\n         record, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion by\n         awarding no attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in\n         defending against the action to appellants.16\n\n         The trial court ruled that $53,950 in attorneys' fees was a reasonable\n\nand necessary fee. It had the discretion to award that amount, or something\n\nless than that, but it was an abuse of discretion to award no attorneys' fees.\n\nB.       Segregation of attorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants\n\n         It was unnecessary to segregate the attorneys' fees as between each of\n\nthe Kirklin Defendants because all attorneys' fees at issue in this appeal were\n\nfor legal services performed on behalf of all the Kirklin Defendants,\n\nincluding The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. Thus, the Kirklin Defendants' claims\n\nfor attorneys' fees and sanctions were \"inextricably intertwined\" as between\n\neach of the Kirklin Defendants. As stated by the 14th Court of Appeals:\n\n\n\n16\n     Avila @ 5 (emphasis added)\n                                                                      11 | P a g e\n\f       ...if a party proves that the claims arise out of the same\n       transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or\n       defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts,\n       then the fees are deemed to be \"intertwined to the point of being\n       inseparable,\" and the party seeking attorney's fees may recover\n       the entire amount of fees covering all claims.17\n\n       At the trial level, all the legal issues applied to all the Kirklin\n\nDefendants equally, and they offered evidence that every single one of the\n\nitemized attorneys' fees entries were performed on behalf of all the Kirklin\n\nDefendants.18\n\n       It would be impossible to segregate these \"inextricably intertwined\"\n\nattorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants, and Texas law doesn't\n\nrequire segregation between the parties that are seeking attorneys' fees in\n\nsuch a situation.\n\nC.     Segregation of Attorneys' Fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs\n\n       There were two plaintiffs in this litigation at the trial level, Fleming\n\nand Fleming & Associates, LLP (\"F&A\") (or collectively \"Fleming\n\nPlaintiffs\"). But only Fleming is a plaintiff in this appeal, and the Kirklin\n\nDefendants are seeking attorneys' fees against only him. The Kirklin\n\nDefendants' attorneys did engage in activities that related to only Fleming\n\nand not to Fleming & Associates, LLP and vice versa. Thus, the Kirklin\n\n17\n   Air Routing Intern. Corp. (Canada) v. Britannia Airways, Ltd., 150 S.W.3d 682, 693\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.)\n18\n   1 RR 92 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n                                                                            12 | P a g e\n\fDefendants were required to segregate their attorneys' fees as between\n\nFleming and Fleming & Associates, LLP, and they did.\n\n         But Fleming argues in his Brief of Cross-Appellee that the Kirklin\n\nDefendants failed to segregate attorneys' fees as between the Fleming\n\nPlaintiffs:\n\n         Last, despite losing one of the two TCPA motions they copied,\n         the Kirklins still sought almost $54,000 in trial-level fees at\n         higher hourly rates than the other attorneys had billed. Overall,\n         the Kirklins' times sheets demonstrate their lack of \"a good faith\n         effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive,\n         redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.19\n\n         With respect to factor (4), the U.S. Supreme Court has held \"the\n         most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee\n         award is the degree of success obtained....\" Little need be said\n         on the subject. Even with the benefit of copying other attorneys'\n         ideas and work product, the Kirklins managed to succeed in just\n         one of the two motions they filed.... Therefore, if the Court does\n         not affirm the denial of attorneys' fees due to the Kirklins' pro\n         se attorney status...It should begin with a 50% fee reduction to\n         reflect the Kirklins' limited success.20\n\n         This argument is misleading and incorrect. The Kirklin Defendants\n\nsegregated the attorneys' fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and they are\n\nonly seeking the attorneys' fees attributable to work performed in connection\n\nwith Fleming's claims (on which they were successful). The Kirklin\n\nDefendants specifically excluded the attorneys' fees attributable to work\n\n\n19\n     Brief of Cross-Appellee @ 23\n20\n     Id. @ 26\n                                                                       13 | P a g e\n\fperformed in connection with F&A's claims (on which they were initially\n\nunsuccessful in their anti-SLAPP motion, but ultimately successful in\n\nsummary judgment).\n\n         This segregation was laid out clearly in Charles Kirklins' declaration\n\nwhen the attorneys' fees were separated into two categories:\n\n         (1) \"LEGAL SERVICES RE: FLEMING & ASSOCIATES,\n         LLP,\"21 and\n\n         (2) \"LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO MOTION TO\n         DISMISS CLAIMS BY GEORGE FLEMING\"22\n\n         The Kirklin Defendants excluded the first category from their\n\nattorneys' fees damages calculation, as can be seen at 1 RR 96 (March 30,\n\n2015 Hearing), which calculates only the \"TOTALS FOR LEGAL\n\nSERVICES RELATED TO MOTION TO DISMISS CLAIMS OF\n\nGEORGE FLEMING 1/12/15 – 3/30/15\" at $53,950.00. This is the total\n\namount that the Kirklin Defendants are seeking in this appeal for attorneys'\n\nfees at the trial level.\n\n         Thus, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. segregated its calculation of\n\nattorneys' fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and they are only seeking\n\nattorneys' fees for work performed in connection with the claims asserted by\n\nFleming, individually.\n\n21\n     1 RR 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n22\n     1 RR 94 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n                                                                     14 | P a g e\n\fD.     Sanctions\n\nAccording to the TCPA Sec. 27.009:\n\n       (a) If the court orders dismissal of a legal action under [Chapter 27\n       of the CPRC], the court shall award to the moving party:\n\n              (1) court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other\n              expenses incurred in defending against the legal action as\n              justice and equity may require; and\n\n              (2) sanctions against the party who brought the legal\n              action as the court determines sufficient to deter the party\n              who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions\n              described in this chapter.23\n\n       The American Heritage Capital court concluded that evidence of\n\nprevious litigation could be considered \"along with all the other evidence in\n\ndetermining, as a matter of discretion, how large the sanction needed to be to\n\naccomplish its statutory purpose.\"24 But it held that even if there were no\n\nprior litigation, an award of sanctions is still required under the TCPA.25\n\nThus, the Kirklin Defendants aren't required to prove that Fleming engaged\n\nin previous litigation against them to be entitled to sanctions.\n\n       In his Brief of Cross-Appellee, Fleming quibbles with the Kirklin\n\nDefendants' characterization of his previous lawsuits against them. The\n\nKirklin Defendants disagree with Fleming's description of these lawsuits and\n\n23\n   (emphasis added)\n24\n   Am. Heritage Capital, LP v. Gonzalez, 436 S.W.3d 865, 881 (Tex.

The Avila case didn't reach the issue of\n\nsanctions, but it held that the TCPA's requirement regarding attorney's fees\n\nmeans the trial court must award an amount in excess of zero:\n\n      While the statute affords the trial court discretion to adjust\n      downward reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses\n      incurred in defending against the action as justice and equity\n      may require, the statute does not afford discretion to award no\n      attorney's fees...26\n\n      Although we haven't found a case that specifically applies this same\n\nreasoning to sanctions, the logic is exactly the same, and it should extend to\n\nsanctions. In a dismissal under the TCPA, sanctions are required, just as\n\nattorneys' fees are required. The trial court has discretion over the amount of\n\nsanctions and attorneys' fees, but it doesn't have discretion over whether\n\nsanctions and attorneys' fees should be awarded. Thus, the trial court must\n\naward some amount of sanctions and attorney's fees in excess of zero, or else\n\nit is a violation of the TCPA and an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n26\n  Avila v.

This was an abuse of discretion because the\n\nTCPA requires sanctions, and an award of zero sanctions is no sanction at\n\nall.\n\n                                        PRAYER\n\n         Cross-Appellants pray that the trial court's March 30, 2015 Order on\n\nAttorneys' Fees and Sanctions as to the Kirklin Defendants be reversed and\n\nrendered to require Fleming to pay:\n\n         (1)    Attorneys' fees for the trial level in the amount of $53,950; and\n\n         (2)    Sanctions in the amount of $75,000.\n\n         Alternatively, Cross-Appellants pray that the trial court's March 30,\n\n2015 Order on Attorney's Fees and Sanctions be reversed and remanded to\n\n\n27\n     1 RR 88 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n                                                                        17 | P a g e\n\fthe trial court for entry of sanctions and attorney's fees in accordance with\n\nthis Court's opinion.\n\n      Cross-Appellants pray that the trial court's March 30, 2015 Order on\n\nAttorneys' Fees and Sanctions be in all other things sustained.\n\n\n                                        Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                        THE KIRKLIN LAW FIRM, P.C.\n\n\n                                        /s/ Paul S.

He also failed to offer any evidence that would\n\nprove otherwise. Thus, the evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nincurred attorneys' fees stands unrebutted.\n\n       Even if the Kirklin Defendants had not submitted the foregoing\n\nevidence, the Texas Supreme Court has held that trial courts can infer that\n\nattorneys' fees were incurred from circumstantial evidence:\n\n       The record reflects...that services were performed on the\n       doctor's behalf. The attorney filed an answer, a plea in\n       abatement, a motion to dismiss, and a notice of appeal.

While there is no evidence about what\n         Dr. Garcia (or perhaps his insurance carrier) agreed to pay for\n         these services, it blinks reality to assume that the attorney was a\n         volunteer or that Dr. Garcia did not incur attorney's fees for this\n         work.... Because there is some evidence in this case that\n         attorney's fees were both incurred and reasonable, the trial court\n         should have awarded attorney's fees to Dr. Garcia.13\n\n         In this case, there is direct evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nincurred attorneys' fees as explained above, but there is also plenty of\n\ncircumstantial evidence from which attorneys' fees can be inferred as well.\n\nJust as in the Garcia case, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.'s attorneys filed an\n\nanswer, a motion to dismiss, and took other actions on behalf of their client.\n\nAccording to the Garcia case, this circumstantial evidence alone is evidence\n\nthat The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees.\n\n         The $53,950 in attorneys' fees sought by The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nis a reasonable amount. Charles Kirklin testified in support of these\n\nattorneys' fees in detail, and the trial court held that \"$53,950 appears to me\n\nto be a reasonable and necessary fee.\"14 Nevertheless, the trial court\n\nawarded the Kirklin Defendants zero in attorneys' fees at the trial level.\n\n         This was an abuse of discretion because Texas courts have held that\n\nwhen a case is dismissed under the TCPA, if any attorneys' fees were\n\n\n\n13\n     Garcia v.

See Cruz, 452 S.W.3d at 522. While the statute\n         affords the trial court discretion to adjust downward\n         reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in\n         defending against the action as justice and equity may\n         require, the statute does not afford discretion to award no\n         attorney's fees and other expenses when the amount of\n         reasonable fees and other expenses incurred in defending\n         against the action are supported by record evidence. See\n         Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 27.009(a)(1). On this\n         record, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion by\n         awarding no attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in\n         defending against the action to appellants.16\n\n         The trial court ruled that $53,950 in attorneys' fees was a reasonable\n\nand necessary fee. It had the discretion to award that amount, or something\n\nless than that, but it was an abuse of discretion to award no attorneys' fees.\n\nB.       Segregation of attorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants\n\n         It was unnecessary to segregate the attorneys' fees as between each of\n\nthe Kirklin Defendants because all attorneys' fees at issue in this appeal were\n\nfor legal services performed on behalf of all the Kirklin Defendants,\n\nincluding The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. Thus, the Kirklin Defendants' claims\n\nfor attorneys' fees and sanctions were \"inextricably intertwined\" as between\n\neach of the Kirklin Defendants. As stated by the 14th Court of Appeals:\n\n\n\n16\n     Avila @ 5 (emphasis added)\n                                                                      11 | P a g e\n\f       ...if a party proves that the claims arise out of the same\n       transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or\n       defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts,\n       then the fees are deemed to be \"intertwined to the point of being\n       inseparable,\" and the party seeking attorney's fees may recover\n       the entire amount of fees covering all claims.17\n\n       At the trial level, all the legal issues applied to all the Kirklin\n\nDefendants equally, and they offered evidence that every single one of the\n\nitemized attorneys' fees entries were performed on behalf of all the Kirklin\n\nDefendants.18\n\n       It would be impossible to segregate these \"inextricably intertwined\"\n\nattorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants, and Texas law doesn't\n\nrequire segregation between the parties that are seeking attorneys' fees in\n\nsuch a situation.\n\nC.     Segregation of Attorneys' Fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs\n\n       There were two plaintiffs in this litigation at the trial level, Fleming\n\nand Fleming & Associates, LLP (\"F&A\") (or collectively \"Fleming\n\nPlaintiffs\"). But only Fleming is a plaintiff in this appeal, and the Kirklin\n\nDefendants are seeking attorneys' fees against only him. The Kirklin\n\nDefendants' attorneys did engage in activities that related to only Fleming\n\nand not to Fleming & Associates, LLP and vice versa. Thus, the Kirklin\n\n17\n   Air Routing Intern.

Overall,\n         the Kirklins' times sheets demonstrate their lack of \"a good faith\n         effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive,\n         redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.19\n\n         With respect to factor (4), the U.S. Supreme Court has held \"the\n         most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee\n         award is the degree of success obtained....\" Little need be said\n         on the subject. Even with the benefit of copying other attorneys'\n         ideas and work product, the Kirklins managed to succeed in just\n         one of the two motions they filed.... Therefore, if the Court does\n         not affirm the denial of attorneys' fees due to the Kirklins' pro\n         se attorney status...It should begin with a 50% fee reduction to\n         reflect the Kirklins' limited success.20\n\n         This argument is misleading and incorrect. The Kirklin Defendants\n\nsegregated the attorneys' fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and they are\n\nonly seeking the attorneys' fees attributable to work performed in connection\n\nwith Fleming's claims (on which they were successful). The Kirklin\n\nDefendants specifically excluded the attorneys' fees attributable to work\n\n\n19\n     Brief of Cross-Appellee @ 23\n20\n     Id. @ 26\n                                                                       13 | P a g e\n\fperformed in connection with F&A's claims (on which they were initially\n\nunsuccessful in their anti-SLAPP motion, but ultimately successful in\n\nsummary judgment).\n\n         This segregation was laid out clearly in Charles Kirklins' declaration\n\nwhen the attorneys' fees were separated into two categories:\n\n         (1) \"LEGAL SERVICES RE: FLEMING & ASSOCIATES,\n         LLP,\"21 and\n\n         (2) \"LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO MOTION TO\n         DISMISS CLAIMS BY GEORGE FLEMING\"22\n\n         The Kirklin Defendants excluded the first category from their\n\nattorneys' fees damages calculation, as can be seen at 1 RR 96 (March 30,\n\n2015 Hearing), which calculates only the \"TOTALS FOR LEGAL\n\nSERVICES RELATED TO MOTION TO DISMISS CLAIMS OF\n\nGEORGE FLEMING 1/12/15 – 3/30/15\" at $53,950.00. This is the total\n\namount that the Kirklin Defendants are seeking in this appeal for attorneys'\n\nfees at the trial level.\n\n         Thus, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. segregated its calculation of\n\nattorneys' fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and they are only seeking\n\nattorneys' fees for work performed in connection with the claims asserted by\n\nFleming, individually.\n\n21\n     1 RR 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n22\n     1 RR 94 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n                                                                     14 | P a g e\n\fD.     Sanctions\n\nAccording to the TCPA Sec. 27.009:\n\n       (a) If the court orders dismissal of a legal action under [Chapter 27\n       of the CPRC], the court shall award to the moving party:\n\n              (1) court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other\n              expenses incurred in defending against the legal action as\n              justice and equity may require; and\n\n              (2) sanctions against the party who brought the legal\n              action as the court determines sufficient to deter the party\n              who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions\n              described in this chapter.23\n\n       The American Heritage Capital court concluded that evidence of\n\nprevious litigation could be considered \"along with all the other evidence in\n\ndetermining, as a matter of discretion, how large the sanction needed to be to\n\naccomplish its statutory purpose.\"24 But it held that even if there were no\n\nprior litigation, an award of sanctions is still required under the TCPA.25\n\nThus, the Kirklin Defendants aren't required to prove that Fleming engaged\n\nin previous litigation against them to be entitled to sanctions.\n\n       In his Brief of Cross-Appellee, Fleming quibbles with the Kirklin\n\nDefendants' characterization of his previous lawsuits against them. The\n\nKirklin Defendants disagree with Fleming's description of these lawsuits and\n\n23\n   (emphasis added)\n24\n   Am. Heritage Capital, LP v.

The Avila case didn't reach the issue of\n\nsanctions, but it held that the TCPA's requirement regarding attorney's fees\n\nmeans the trial court must award an amount in excess of zero:\n\n      While the statute affords the trial court discretion to adjust\n      downward reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses\n      incurred in defending against the action as justice and equity\n      may require, the statute does not afford discretion to award no\n      attorney's fees...26\n\n      Although we haven't found a case that specifically applies this same\n\nreasoning to sanctions, the logic is exactly the same, and it should extend to\n\nsanctions. In a dismissal under the TCPA, sanctions are required, just as\n\nattorneys' fees are required. The trial court has discretion over the amount of\n\nsanctions and attorneys' fees, but it doesn't have discretion over whether\n\nsanctions and attorneys' fees should be awarded. Thus, the trial court must\n\naward some amount of sanctions and attorney's fees in excess of zero, or else\n\nit is a violation of the TCPA and an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n26\n  Avila v.
