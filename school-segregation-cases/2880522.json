In May and\n\nJuly, 2003, he filed three actions under 28 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fCourt for the District of New Jersey.1 In these three actions, Adegbuji alleged that the\n\ndefendants: (1) prohibited him from attending Sunday worship services while he was in\n\nadministrative custody; (2) denied him access to the law library or legal papers while in\n\nsegregation; (3) subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment with respect to other\n\nprison conditions in solitary confinement (no shower, toothbrush, mattress, blanket, soap,\n\nor hygiene items for 3 days; one shower a week, one jumpsuit per month, no visitation or\n\ncommissary privileges, no fresh air recreation (or forced recreation when he did not want\n\nit) and no haircut or beard trim for twenty-seven days); (4) engaged in an unreasonable\n\nsearch and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (5) denied him access to the\n\ntelephone and to legal and other mail; (6) failed to provide procedural due process in\n\ndisciplinary hearings and with regard to deprivation of his personal property; and (7)\n\nviolated his right under the Equal Protection Clause to be treated like other detainees.2\n\nHe sought declaratory relief and damages.\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     The three complaints cover different time periods as follows: Civ. No. 03-02217 -\nApril 15, 2003 through May 4, 2003; Civ. No. 03-02366 - May 9, 2003 through May 12,\n2003; and Civ. No. 03-03221 - May 14, 2003 through June 9, 2003.\n   2\n     Adegbuji also claimed that his placement in solitary confinement due to his\nconscientious religious objection to “forced” recreation on a Sabbath day constituted\npersecution under the United States Convention Against Torture, Art. 1, and 8 C.F.R.\n208.16(B)(1). Because Adegbuji’s disciplinary segregation was imposed pursuant to\nlawful sanctions, however, it would not be considered “torture” under the Torture\nConvention, Art. 1(1).\n\n                                              3\n\f       The District Court consolidated the actions and dismissed Adegbuji’s complaints\n\nsua sponte for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n       The District Court held that: (1) the prison rule restricting attendance at Sunday\n\nreligious services during recreation time, which Adegbuji admitted only affected him\n\nwhile he was in solitary confinement for three days on two separate occasions, did not\n\nviolate Adegbuji’s First Amendment right of freedom of worship because the restriction,\n\nwas short in duration and was reasonably related to the MCACC’s legitimate penological\n\ngoals of maintaining security and safety in the prison; (2) the strip search conducted upon\n\nhis placement in administrative segregation did not violate Adegbuji’s Fourth\n\nAmendment rights because the prison had a legitimate penological interest in maintaining\n\na safe prison segregation environment free of weapons, drugs, and other contraband, and\n\nthere was no allegation that the search itself was performed in an unreasonable manner;\n\n(3) although Adegbuji alleged that he was denied procedural due process under Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, when the prison did not give him notice of disciplinary charges on May 4 and\n\nMay 9, 2003, the related disciplinary reports attached to Adegbuji’s Complaint show that\n\nhe received separate notices for each set of charges and timely hearings were held; (4) the\n\nconditions of solitary confinement claims, alone, or in combination, could not establish\n\nthat the defendants deprived him of any measure of life’s necessities; (5) the Complaint\n\nfailed to state an Equal Protection claim because there were no allegations from which the\n\ncourt could infer that inmates allegedly receiving more favorable treatment were similarly\n\n                                             4\n\fsituated, or that Adegbuji’s allegedly disparate treatment resulted from intentional\n\ndiscrimination by the defendants; and (6) Adegbuji failed to state a claim of supervisory\n\nliability against the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections. Finally, the District\n\nCourt dismissed as meritless all of Adegbuji’s access to the courts claims on due process\n\nand other grounds. This timely appeal followed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our standard of review of the\n\nDistrict Court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim is plenary. Allah v. Seiverling, 229\n\nF.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000). “We must accept as true the factual allegations in the\n\ncomplaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.” Nami v. Fauver,\n\n82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). We will affirm the District Court’s order\n\ndismissing Adegbuji’s complaints only if it appears that he could prove no set of facts\n\nthat would entitle him to relief. Higgins v. Beyer, 293 F.3d 683, 688 (3d Cir. 2002). We\n\nwill affirm as to all defendants and as to all claims for the reasons set forth in the District\n\nCourt’s Opinion, except the denial of access to the courts claims and denial of phone\n\nprivileges claim, which are further discussed below.\n\n       Turning to his first access to the courts claim, Adegbuji alleged that he was denied\n\naccess to the law library and was denied his legal papers and commissary supplies while\n\nhe was in solitary confinement, causing him to miss filing deadlines in his immigration\n\ncase. The District Court dismissed these claims, concluding that “the alleged conduct by\n\nthe defendants was not a central component of the right of access to the courts, and\n\ntherefore does not state a due process claim or a violation of the First Amendment.” See\n\n                                               5\n\fD.Ct. Opinion, at 21. We agree that the claim was correctly dismissed but for different\n\nreasons. Adegbuji failed to allege any actual injury. See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343,\n\n351 (1996) (holding that a claimant seeking damages for the denial of access to the courts\n\nmust “demonstrate that the alleged” deprivation of legal materials “hindered his efforts to\n\npursue a legal claim”). Adegbuji admits that he received continuances and does not\n\nallege that any case was dismissed for failure to file a timely pleading.\n\n       Likewise, Adegbuji alleged no actual injury with respect to his second access to\n\nthe courts claim. There, he alleged that the defendants improperly returned legal mail\n\nfrom the District Court, namely an order denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n\nAdegbuji claims that this caused him to miss the thirty-day appeal period.3 But Adegbuji\n\nhad sixty days within which to file an appeal because the defendant was a federal agency.\n\nAdegbuji filed a timely appeal in the habeas corpus case that resulted in a decision by this\n\nCourt issued in April, 2004. See Adegbuji v. Quarrantillo, Civ. No. 02-04878.\n\n       Adegbuji’s last access to the courts claim, however, should not have been\n\ndismissed sua sponte. In Oliver v. Fauver, 118 F.3d 175, 177 (3d Cir. 1997), we held that\n\nLewis merely requires a claimant to show that the deprivation led to an actual injury\n\n“such as the loss or rejection of a legal claim.” Here, the District Court determined that\n\n\n   3\n      The District Court also treated Adegbuji’s claim as a due process claim, holding held\nthat one isolated instance of interference with the mail did not rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation. D.Ct. Op., at 27-28. The case the District Court relied on,\nMorgan v. Montayne, 516 F.2d 1367 (2d Cir. 1975), impliedly dealt with a similar claim\nas a denial of access to the courts claim. We believe that Adegbuji’s claim is better\ntreated as a denial of access to the courts claim.\n\n                                              6\n\fAdegbuji was only prevented from filing certain motions and responses in Immigration\n\nCourt. The Complaint in Civ. No. 03-03221, however, alleges that Adegbuji was denied\n\nasylum as a result of the seizure of evidence. Specifically, Adegbuji alleged that on June\n\n5, 2003, while he was confined in disciplinary segregation, correctional officers searched\n\nhis cell on the pretext that they were looking for contraband and, in the process, seized\n\ntwo sets of newspapers that Adegbuji had received from family members. Inside the\n\nnewspapers were photocopies of vital documents sent to him by his family in Nigeria\n\nalong with a brief he had prepared in support of asylum. See Complaint, Civ. No. 03-\n\n03221, ¶¶ 23-25. He alleged that the papers were never returned to him and, as a result,\n\nthe immigration court denied him asylum because he was unable to provide all of the\n\nrequired corroborative evidence needed to prove his claim.4 Id., ¶¶ 26-27.\n\n       Based on Adegbuji’s allegations, we conclude that he stated a claim of denial of\n\naccess to the courts sufficient to survive sua sponte dismissal under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n\nMoreover, Adegbuji’s allegation that the cell search was pretextual suggests that the\n\nseizure was not simply the result of negligence on the defendants’ part, and thus, the\n\nclaim is not subject to dismissal on the alternate ground that it is non-cognizable because\n\nit alleges only negligence. See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O’Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d\n\n1250, 1277 (3d Cir. 1994) (holding that a negligent deprivation will not sustain a § 1983\n\n\n   4\n     The District Court also treated this claim as asserting a deprivation of property\nwithout due process. For the reasons stated in its Opinion, the District Court correctly\ndismissed the claim because Adegbuji had an adequate post-deprivation remedy via the\nNew Jersey Tort Claims Act. D.Ct. Op., at 28-30.\n\n                                             7\n\fclaim). Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court’s order to the extent that it\n\ndismissed this claim.\n\n       Finally, the District Court erred in dismissing Adegbuji’s denial of phone access\n\nclaim raised in Civ. No. 03-03221, because he failed to allege specific instances when the\n\ndefendants denied him telephone privileges while he was confined in segregation. As it\n\nstands, the allegations fail to state a due process claim or a denial of access to the courts\n\nclaim. However, the District Court did not give Adegbuji an opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint, or otherwise determine that any amendment would be inequitable or futile.\n\nSee Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235-236 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the District Court’s order to the extent it\n\ndismissed Adegbuji’s claims, raised in Civ. No. 03-03221, that he was denied access to\n\nthe courts by the wrongful seizure of evidence vital to his asylum case and that he was\n\nwrongfully denied phone privileges. We will remand this matter for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this Opinion. We will affirm the District Court’s order dismissing with\n\nprejudice the remaining claims raised in the consolidated action. Appellant’s motion to\n\nsupplement the record is granted.\n\f",

In May and\n\nJuly, 2003, he filed three actions under 28 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fCourt for the District of New Jersey.1 In these three actions, Adegbuji alleged that the\n\ndefendants: (1) prohibited him from attending Sunday worship services while he was in\n\nadministrative custody; (2) denied him access to the law library or legal papers while in\n\nsegregation; (3) subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment with respect to other\n\nprison conditions in solitary confinement (no shower, toothbrush, mattress, blanket, soap,\n\nor hygiene items for 3 days; one shower a week, one jumpsuit per month, no visitation or\n\ncommissary privileges, no fresh air recreation (or forced recreation when he did not want\n\nit) and no haircut or beard trim for twenty-seven days); (4) engaged in an unreasonable\n\nsearch and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (5) denied him access to the\n\ntelephone and to legal and other mail; (6) failed to provide procedural due process in\n\ndisciplinary hearings and with regard to deprivation of his personal property; and (7)\n\nviolated his right under the Equal Protection Clause to be treated like other detainees.2\n\nHe sought declaratory relief and damages.\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     The three complaints cover different time periods as follows: Civ. No. 03-02217 -\nApril 15, 2003 through May 4, 2003; Civ. No. 03-02366 - May 9, 2003 through May 12,\n2003; and Civ. No. 03-03221 - May 14, 2003 through June 9, 2003.\n   2\n     Adegbuji also claimed that his placement in solitary confinement due to his\nconscientious religious objection to “forced” recreation on a Sabbath day constituted\npersecution under the United States Convention Against Torture, Art. 1, and 8 C.F.R.\n208.16(B)(1). Because Adegbuji’s disciplinary segregation was imposed pursuant to\nlawful sanctions, however, it would not be considered “torture” under the Torture\nConvention, Art. 1(1).\n\n                                              3\n\f       The District Court consolidated the actions and dismissed Adegbuji’s complaints\n\nsua sponte for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n       The District Court held that: (1) the prison rule restricting attendance at Sunday\n\nreligious services during recreation time, which Adegbuji admitted only affected him\n\nwhile he was in solitary confinement for three days on two separate occasions, did not\n\nviolate Adegbuji’s First Amendment right of freedom of worship because the restriction,\n\nwas short in duration and was reasonably related to the MCACC’s legitimate penological\n\ngoals of maintaining security and safety in the prison; (2) the strip search conducted upon\n\nhis placement in administrative segregation did not violate Adegbuji’s Fourth\n\nAmendment rights because the prison had a legitimate penological interest in maintaining\n\na safe prison segregation environment free of weapons, drugs, and other contraband, and\n\nthere was no allegation that the search itself was performed in an unreasonable manner;\n\n(3) although Adegbuji alleged that he was denied procedural due process under Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, when the prison did not give him notice of disciplinary charges on May 4 and\n\nMay 9, 2003, the related disciplinary reports attached to Adegbuji’s Complaint show that\n\nhe received separate notices for each set of charges and timely hearings were held; (4) the\n\nconditions of solitary confinement claims, alone, or in combination, could not establish\n\nthat the defendants deprived him of any measure of life’s necessities; (5) the Complaint\n\nfailed to state an Equal Protection claim because there were no allegations from which the\n\ncourt could infer that inmates allegedly receiving more favorable treatment were similarly\n\n                                             4\n\fsituated, or that Adegbuji’s allegedly disparate treatment resulted from intentional\n\ndiscrimination by the defendants; and (6) Adegbuji failed to state a claim of supervisory\n\nliability against the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections. Finally, the District\n\nCourt dismissed as meritless all of Adegbuji’s access to the courts claims on due process\n\nand other grounds. This timely appeal followed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our standard of review of the\n\nDistrict Court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim is plenary. Allah v. Seiverling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770720\"><a href=\"/opinion/770720/michael-malik-allah-v-thomas-seiverling-robert-sparbanie-john-deletto-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (3d Cir. 2000). “We must accept as true the factual allegations in the\n\ncomplaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.” Nami v.

We will affirm the District Court’s order\n\ndismissing Adegbuji’s complaints only if it appears that he could prove no set of facts\n\nthat would entitle him to relief. Higgins v. Beyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778009\"><a href=\"/opinion/778009/vincent-m-higgins-v-howard-l-beyer-department-of-corrections-william-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688 (3d Cir. 2002). We\n\nwill affirm as to all defendants and as to all claims for the reasons set forth in the District\n\nCourt’s Opinion, except the denial of access to the courts claims and denial of phone\n\nprivileges claim, which are further discussed below.\n\n       Turning to his first access to the courts claim, Adegbuji alleged that he was denied\n\naccess to the law library and was denied his legal papers and commissary supplies while\n\nhe was in solitary confinement, causing him to miss filing deadlines in his immigration\n\ncase. The District Court dismissed these claims, concluding that “the alleged conduct by\n\nthe defendants was not a central component of the right of access to the courts, and\n\ntherefore does not state a due process claim or a violation of the First Amendment.” See\n\n                                               5\n\fD.Ct. Opinion, at 21. We agree that the claim was correctly dismissed but for different\n\nreasons. Adegbuji failed to allege any actual injury. See Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n351 (1996) (holding that a claimant seeking damages for the denial of access to the courts\n\nmust “demonstrate that the alleged” deprivation of legal materials “hindered his efforts to\n\npursue a legal claim”). Adegbuji admits that he received continuances and does not\n\nallege that any case was dismissed for failure to file a timely pleading.\n\n       Likewise, Adegbuji alleged no actual injury with respect to his second access to\n\nthe courts claim. There, he alleged that the defendants improperly returned legal mail\n\nfrom the District Court, namely an order denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n\nAdegbuji claims that this caused him to miss the thirty-day appeal period.3 But Adegbuji\n\nhad sixty days within which to file an appeal because the defendant was a federal agency.\n\nAdegbuji filed a timely appeal in the habeas corpus case that resulted in a decision by this\n\nCourt issued in April, 2004. See Adegbuji v. Quarrantillo, Civ. No. 02-04878.\n\n       Adegbuji’s last access to the courts claim, however, should not have been\n\ndismissed sua sponte. In Oliver v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743496\"><a href=\"/opinion/743496/lorenzo-oliver-v-william-fauver-commissioner-of-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 (3d Cir. 1997), we held that\n\nLewis merely requires a claimant to show that the deprivation led to an actual injury\n\n“such as the loss or rejection of a legal claim.” Here, the District Court determined that\n\n\n   3\n      The District Court also treated Adegbuji’s claim as a due process claim, holding held\nthat one isolated instance of interference with the mail did not rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation. D.Ct. Op., at 27-28. The case the District Court relied on,\nMorgan v. Montayne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327970\"><a href=\"/opinion/327970/zachary-morgan-v-ernest-montanye-warden-of-attica-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1975), impliedly dealt with a similar claim\nas a denial of access to the courts claim. We believe that Adegbuji’s claim is better\ntreated as a denial of access to the courts claim.\n\n                                              6\n\fAdegbuji was only prevented from filing certain motions and responses in Immigration\n\nCourt. The Complaint in Civ. No. 03-03221, however, alleges that Adegbuji was denied\n\nasylum as a result of the seizure of evidence. Specifically, Adegbuji alleged that on June\n\n5, 2003, while he was confined in disciplinary segregation, correctional officers searched\n\nhis cell on the pretext that they were looking for contraband and, in the process, seized\n\ntwo sets of newspapers that Adegbuji had received from family members. Inside the\n\nnewspapers were photocopies of vital documents sent to him by his family in Nigeria\n\nalong with a brief he had prepared in support of asylum. See Complaint, Civ. No. 03-\n\n03221, ¶¶ 23-25. He alleged that the papers were never returned to him and, as a result,\n\nthe immigration court denied him asylum because he was unable to provide all of the\n\nrequired corroborative evidence needed to prove his claim.4 Id., ¶¶ 26-27.\n\n       Based on Adegbuji’s allegations, we conclude that he stated a claim of denial of\n\naccess to the courts sufficient to survive sua sponte dismissal under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n\nMoreover, Adegbuji’s allegation that the cell search was pretextual suggests that the\n\nseizure was not simply the result of negligence on the defendants’ part, and thus, the\n\nclaim is not subject to dismissal on the alternate ground that it is non-cognizable because\n\nit alleges only negligence. See Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O’Brien & Frankel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667153\"><a href=\"/opinion/667153/joe-j-jordan-james-e-mitchell-jordan-mitchell-inc-v-fox-rothschild/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1277 (3d Cir. 1994) (holding that a negligent deprivation will not sustain a § 1983\n\n\n   4\n     The District Court also treated this claim as asserting a deprivation of property\nwithout due process. For the reasons stated in its Opinion, the District Court correctly\ndismissed the claim because Adegbuji had an adequate post-deprivation remedy via the\nNew Jersey Tort Claims Act. D.Ct. Op., at 28-30.\n\n                                             7\n\fclaim). Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court’s order to the extent that it\n\ndismissed this claim.\n\n       Finally, the District Court erred in dismissing Adegbuji’s denial of phone access\n\nclaim raised in Civ. No. 03-03221, because he failed to allege specific instances when the\n\ndefendants denied him telephone privileges while he was confined in segregation. As it\n\nstands, the allegations fail to state a due process claim or a denial of access to the courts\n\nclaim. However, the District Court did not give Adegbuji an opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint, or otherwise determine that any amendment would be inequitable or futile.\n\nSee Alston v. Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785662\"><a href=\"/opinion/785662/gary-marshall-alston-v-william-parker-jack-singer-njnewark-dc-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235-236 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the District Court’s order to the extent it\n\ndismissed Adegbuji’s claims, raised in Civ. No. 03-03221, that he was denied access to\n\nthe courts by the wrongful seizure of evidence vital to his asylum case and that he was\n\nwrongfully denied phone privileges. We will remand this matter for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this Opinion. We will affirm the District Court’s order dismissing with\n\nprejudice the remaining claims raised in the consolidated action. Appellant’s motion to\n\nsupplement the record is granted.\n\f</pre>",
