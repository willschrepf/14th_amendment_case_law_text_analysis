(No. 4:91-CV-\n169-RLV), Robert L. Vining, Jr., Judge.\n\nBefore TJOFLAT, DUBINA and BARKETT, Circuit Judges.\n\n       TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge:\n\n       Robert Lewis Collier appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In 1978,\n\nCollier was convicted in the Superior Court of Catoosa County, Georgia, of felony murder,\n\naggravated assault, and three armed robberies. Collier was sentenced to death for the murder\n\nconviction. The murder occurred as Collier fled from the scene of three armed robberies; the victim\n\nwas a deputy sheriff. Collier's petition for habeas corpus relief presented a number of constitutional\n\nchallenges to both his convictions and his death sentence. In this appeal, however, Collier primarily\n\nchallenges the district court's conclusion that his death sentence is not constitutionally infirm. He\n\ncontends that, in violation of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978),\n\nthe superior court impermissibly limited the scope of the mitigating evidence that he was permitted\n\nto present to the jury during the sentencing phase of his trial. Alternatively, Collier argues that, in\n\nviolation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, his attorneys rendered\n\nineffective assistance of counsel in failing to present evidence of his background and character that\n\nlikely would have led the jury to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than of death. We\n\fconclude that Collier's counsel were ineffective, and therefore direct the district court to issue the\n\nwrit with respect to Collier's death sentence.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       On April 14, 1978, Collier left his home in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, and drove to Fort\n\nOglethorpe, Georgia, intending to commit a robbery. In Fort Oglethorpe, Collier parked his car\n\nbeside a fast food restaurant, placed a .32 caliber revolver in a grocery bag, and walked to a nearby\n\nfloral shop. After entering the shop, Collier drew the revolver and demanded money from the cash\n\nregister as well as from the four women present in the shop. Collier took the cash but allowed the\n\nwomen to keep their purses. After telling them to get down on the floor and put their hands behind\n\ntheir heads, Collier exited the store, walked to his car, placed the sack containing the money and the\n\ngun in the trunk, and began driving back toward South Pittsburgh.\n\n       The women in the store immediately called the police, and the Catoosa County Sheriff's\n\nDepartment was notified. Sheriff's Investigator George Brown responded to the call and began\n\ndriving to the floral shop. While en route, Brown passed Collier driving in the opposite direction.\n\nRecognizing Collier's car from the description he had received on his radio, Brown turned his car\n\naround, caught up with Collier, and activated his blue lights. Collier immediately stopped his car\n\nand got out. Collier began walking toward Brown's car with his wallet in his hand. Drawing his\n\ngun, Brown ordered Collier to \"spread eagle\" and to place his hands on his car. At approximately\n\nthe same time, Sheriff's Deputy Baxter Shavers arrived and approached Collier and Brown with his\n\ngun drawn. Seeing Shavers with his gun drawn, Brown holstered his own weapon and began to pat\n\nCollier down.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Shavers then walked up to Collier and, while pointing his gun at Collier, began to look into\n\nCollier's car. Collier grabbed the gun from Shavers, throwing Brown off of him in the process. As\n\nBrown attempted to draw his weapon again, Collier fired two shots at him, hitting him once in the\n\nhip and knocking him to the ground. Shavers had begun running toward his vehicle when Collier\n\nturned and fired shots at him. One shot hit Shavers in the neck, killing him instantly. Collier got\n\ninto his car and began to drive away. In the meantime, Brown, still on the ground, had drawn his\n\nweapon and fired six harmless shots into Collier's fleeing automobile. The shots failed to disable\n\nCollier or his vehicle.\n\n       Collier returned to South Pittsburgh, gathered his wife and their two sons, and drove to\n\nAlabama. The next day, however, Collier decided to return to South Pittsburgh. He was\n\napprehended by Tennessee law enforcement before he reached his home. Within one hour of his\n\narrest, Collier gave a statement to a Tennessee State Trooper that implicated him in the crimes.\n\nCollier then asked for, and received, permission to contact an attorney who previously had\n\nrepresented him. After the attorney arrived, Collier was placed in a lineup and identified as the\n\nperson who had robbed the floral shop and the four customers. Following this identification, Collier,\n\ncontrary to his attorney's advice, waived his right to remain silent and gave a complete confession.\n\n       Collier thereafter waived his right to an extradition hearing, and the Sheriff of Catossa\n\nCounty, Georgia, took him into custody. On his return to Georgia, Collier was indicted by a Catossa\n\nCounty grand jury for felony murder, aggravated assault for the shooting of Brown, and three counts\n\nof armed robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f       The guilt phase of Collier's trial began on Monday, September 25, 1978, and concluded on\n\nFriday, September 29, 1978, at 5:50 p.m.1 The jury found Collier guilty as charged. After the court\n\npolled the jury and published the verdicts, the judge announced that the sentencing phase of the trial\n\n(on the murder charge) would begin that evening, following a two-hour recess for dinner.2\n\n       The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. and concluded one hour and twenty-eight minutes\n\nlater, at 9:28 p.m., when the jury retired to deliberate. The jury returned its verdict, imposing the\n\ndeath penalty rather than life imprisonment, at 12:05 a.m. the next morning.3\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed Collier's convictions and sentences\n\nfor felony murder, aggravated assault, and two of the three armed robberies; the court reversed\n\nCollier's conviction for one of the armed robbery offenses because it had served as a lesser included\n\noffense of the felony murder. See Collier v. State, 244 Ga. 553, 261 S.E.2d 364, 374 (1979),\n\noverruled in part by Thompson v. State, 263 Ga. 23, 426 S.E.2d 895 (1993). Collier's petition for\n\n\n\n   1\n   Collier was represented at trial by three attorneys, Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and James\nSecord. See infra note 9. The State was represented by District Attorney William Campbell and\nAssistant District Attorney Craig Gillenn.\n   2\n   Neither party objected to proceeding that evening nor requested a continuance until the next\nday, Saturday, or the following Monday.\n   3\n    The jury based its verdict on the following aggravating circumstances: (1) Collier\ncommitted the murder of Deputy Shavers while committing another capital felony; (2) the\nvictim was a peace officer who, at the time of the murder, was engaged in the performance of his\nofficial duties; and (3) Collier committed the murder for the purpose of preventing his lawful\narrest.\n\n               The court subsequently implemented the jury's verdict at the sentencing hearing.\n       In addition, the court imposed the following sentences: twenty years imprisonment for\n       the aggravated assault conviction, and consecutive ten-year terms of imprisonment for\n       each of the three armed robbery convictions.\n\n                                                  4\n\fa writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court was denied. See Collier v. Georgia, 445\n\nU.S. 946, 100 S.Ct. 1346, 63 L.Ed.2d 781 (1980). On May 14, 1980, Collier petitioned the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for a writ of habeas corpus setting aside\n\nhis convictions and sentences under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.4 The district court dismissed the petition on\n\nMarch 31, 1982, finding that Collier had failed to exhaust his state remedies on a number of his\n\nclaims for relief.\n\n        On June 23, 1982, Collier filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court\n\nof Butts County, Georgia.5 After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the petition on December\n\n22, 1982, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. See Collier v. Francis, 251 Ga. 512, 307 S.E.2d\n\n485 (1983). On December 22, 1983, Collier filed his second petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\n\nthe Northern District of Georgia. On February 28, 1984, the district court dismissed the petition for\n\nfailure to exhaust state remedies; we, in turn, denied Collier's application for a certificate of\n\nprobable cause to appeal.\n\n        On October 22, 1984, Collier filed a second habeas petition in the Superior Court of Butts\n\nCounty. The state moved to dismiss the petition pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 9-14-51 on the ground that\n\nthe petition was successive. The superior court granted the state's motion and dismissed the petition\n\non July 2, 1985; the Georgia Supreme Court thereafter denied Collier's application for a certificate\n\nof probable cause to appeal. Collier filed his third federal habeas petition in the Northern District\n\nof Georgia on October 6, 1986. Concluding that the petition was a mixed petition within the\n\n\n\n\n   4\n    This was the first of four habeas petitions Collier filed in that court under § 2254; the fourth\npetition is the one now before us.\n   5\n    Collier filed his petition in that court because he was incarcerated in Butts County.\n\n                                                 5\n\fmeaning of Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), in that it contained\n\nboth exhausted and unexhausted claims, the court dismissed it on May 13, 1987.\n\n         In an effort to exhaust all of his claims, Collier returned to the Superior Court of Butts\n\nCounty, filing a third petition for a writ of habeas corpus on September 17, 1987. Following an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the court, on October 12, 1990, rejected the petition without ruling on the merits\n\nof its claims. The court refused to entertain the merits of some of the claims because they were\n\nsuccessive, and thus subject to dismissal under O.C.G.A. § 9-14-51; it refused to entertain the others\n\non the ground that they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On March 1, 1991, the Georgia\n\nSupreme Court denied Collier's application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the superior\n\ncourt's decision.\n\n         On August 9, 1991, Collier filed his fourth petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\n\nNorthern District of Georgia. His petition presented eighteen claims of constitutional error. The\n\nfollowing were among the more significant: (1) during jury selection, the trial court, in violation\n\nof Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), improperly\n\nprohibited defense counsel from asking the venire persons whether they would automatically impose\n\nthe death penalty upon a finding of guilt—a so-called \"reverse-Witherspoon \" claim; (2) the trial\n\ncourt denied Collier a trial by an impartial jury by refusing to grant Collier a change of venue; (3)\n\nthe Georgia death penalty statute, as applied, was unconstitutionally discriminatory; (4) the trial\n\ncourt improperly limited the scope of evidence Collier could present at the sentencing phase of his\n\ntrial, in violation of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978); and (5)\n\nCollier was denied the effective assistance of counsel, particularly during the sentencing phase of\n\nhis trial.\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Collier's petition on January 27-28, 1994.\n\nIn a comprehensive order dated February 28, 1995, the court concluded that Collier's claims lacked\n\nmerit and denied relief. On the \"reverse-Witherspoon \" claim, the court found that Collier's counsel\n\nattempted to question only two venire persons about their propensity to impose the death penalty\n\nand that in only one of those cases did the trial judge prevent counsel from inquiring; moreover,\n\ncounsel did not object to the court's ruling in either case. As for the change-of-venue issue, the\n\ndistrict court found that comprehensive questioning of the venire persons by the trial judge and\n\ncounsel revealed no bias against Collier and that the pretrial publicity was not \"so inflammatory and\n\nprejudicial as to warrant a change of venue.\"\n\n       Turning to Collier's claim that the death penalty was applied in a discriminatory manner in\n\nGeorgia, the district court ruled that the claim failed because Collier had not established that his\n\ndeath sentence was the result of discrimination by the decisionmakers in his case. Finally, with\n\nregard to Collier's claims of constitutional infirmity at the sentencing phase, the district court found\n\nthat Collier had neither shown that the trial judge improperly limited the scope of evidence that he\n\ncould present in mitigation nor demonstrated that his counsel were ineffective. The district court\n\nentered its judgment denying the writ on March 1, 1995. Collier thereafter filed a motion to alter\n\nthe judgment, which was denied on April 28, 1995. After the court granted Collier's application for\n\na certificate of probable cause to appeal, this appeal followed.6\n\n                                                  II.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    We have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994).\n\n                                                   7\n\f       Collier's brief on appeal raises essentially the same claims as those he presented to the\n\ndistrict court. The majority of his claims lack merit.7 We therefore reject them without comment,\n\nand limit our discussion to the claim that the sentencing phase of Collier's trial was constitutionally\n\ndeficient. The gravamen of this claim is that the jury was not presented with the wealth of available\n\nmitigating evidence that would have caused it to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than\n\na sentence of death. Collier contends that the jury did not receive this evidence for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the trial judge—in an off-the-record chambers conference shortly before the sentencing phase\n\nof the trial began—improperly limited the mitigation evidence defense counsel could present, in\n\nviolation of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978). Second, defense\n\ncounsel failed to provide the effective assistance of counsel required by the Sixth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the Constitution. We address these two arguments in order.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n       The United States Supreme Court decided Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57\n\nL.Ed.2d 973 (1978), on July 3, 1978, less than three months prior to Collier's trial. In Lockett, the\n\nCourt was presented with the question of whether Ohio \"violated the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments by sentencing Sandra Lockett to death pursuant to a statute that narrowly limit[ed] the\n\n\n\n   7\n     These claims, which challenge Collier's convictions and/or his sentences, are: (1) that the\ntrial court improperly prohibited defense counsel from inquiring into whether the venire persons\nwould automatically impose the death penalty—Collier's \"reverse-Witherspoon \" claim; (2) that\nCollier's death sentence was the result of the racial bias of the decisionmakers; and (3) that the\ntrial court infringed on Collier's constitutional right of confrontation by admitting testimony of\nwitnesses who had been hypnotized. In addition to advancing these challenges to his convictions\nand sentences, Collier contends that we should vacate the district court's judgment and remand\nthe case for further proceedings because the district court erred in refusing to consider evidence\nof the racial bias of both the trial judge and his lead defense attorney. This claim is without\nmerit as well.\n\n                                                  8\n\fsentencer's discretion to consider the circumstances of the crime and the record and character of the\n\noffender as mitigating factors.\" Id. at 589, 98 S.Ct. at 2956-57 (footnote omitted). The Court found\n\nthat the \"qualitative difference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of\n\nreliability when the death sentence is imposed.\" Id. at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964. The Court concluded,\n\ntherefore, that \"the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, [must] not be precluded from\n\nconsidering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the\n\ncircumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\"\n\nId. at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964-65 (footnote omitted). Collier claims that after the guilt phase of his trial\n\nended and the sentencing phase began, the court limited the mitigating evidence that he could\n\npresent to the jury in violation of Lockett.\n\n                                                   1.\n\n        Collier initially raised this Lockett claim on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia,\n\ncontending that the trial judge, Judge Coker—during an off-the-record conference with counsel in\n\nchambers shortly before the sentencing phase of the trial was to begin—instructed defense counsel\n\nthat the only mitigating evidence they could introduce would be evidence of Collier's reputation in\n\nthe community for truth and veracity and evidence of specific acts tending to mitigate the homicide.\n\nAs evidence of this off-the-record conference, Collier's brief to the supreme court pointed to an\n\non-the-record-colloquy between the Judge Coker and Donald Bennett, Collier's lead trial counsel.\n\nThis conversation took place during the sentencing phase after Judge Coker, ruling on the State's\n\nobjection, refused to allow one of Collier's mitigation witnesses to testify that he and Collier had\n\n\"mutual respect\" for each other. In that colloquy, Judge Coker said:\n\n        Well, here we go again, you see, Mr. Bennett, evidently our little talk out there, the\n        bantering back and forth didn't mean very much to you, as to what you were going to do and\n\n                                                    9\n\f       I told you the problem that we get into by just doing these things, and evidently your memory\n       has become rather short. I know what you told me you were going to do, and I felt it might\n       be all right in a case like this.\n\n(emphasis added). Later in this exchange with Bennett, the judge again referred to a prior\n\ndiscussion, stating, \"Well now, Mr. Bennett, I don't want to get into a hassle with you over the thing,\n\nbecause I thought we had an understanding back there on the list of questions that you would submit\n\nto these witnesses.\" (emphasis added).\n\n       Despite the above references in the trial transcript, and the fact that Collier's counsel had\n\nbriefed the issue, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in its opinion disposing of Collier's appeal, limited\n\nits discussion to whether Judge Coker improperly excluded the testimony of the witness' \"mutual\n\nrespect\" for Collier. See Collier v. State, 244 Ga. 553, 261 S.E.2d 364, 375-76 (Ga.1979). The\n\nsupreme court held that, although evidence that is inadmissible under the rules of evidence may be\n\nadmissible as mitigation, the witness' statement about his \"mutual respect\" for Collier was \"not\n\nhighly relevant\" and \"somewhat cumulative\"; therefore, Judge Coker had not abused his discretion\n\nin excluding it. Id. at 376.8\n\n       Collier raised his Lockett claim again in his first state habeas petition to the Butts County\n\nSuperior Court. The court held an evidentiary hearing on October 14, 1982, regarding the alleged\n\noff-the-record conversation between Judge Coker and the defense counsel. Jay Bennett, a member\n\nof Collier's defense team and son of Collier's lead trial counsel, Donald Bennett,9 represented Collier\n\n\n   8\n    The court also noted that defense counsel \"did not make any offer of proof of any specific\nacts of good conduct nor did he attempt to offer evidence of such acts. In fact, the one response\nof the witness now in question was the only evidence excluded by the trial court during the\nsentencing phase of appellant's trial.\" Id.\n   9\n     Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and the third member of Collier's defense team, James Secord,\nall participated in the prosecution of Collier's first and second federal habeas corpus petitions\n\n                                                  10\n\fat the evidentiary hearing and testified in place of his father as to the events of the trial. Jay Bennett\n\ntestified that, prior to the beginning of the sentencing phase, Judge Coker summoned him, his father,\n\nand the District Attorney, William Campbell, to the court's chambers for a conference about the\n\nevidence to be presented during the sentencing phase of the trial.10 Bennett stated that his father\n\ninformed Judge Coker that they had fourteen witnesses to present and that they intended to have the\n\nwitnesses testify about specific instances from Collier's past. According to Bennett, they told Judge\n\nCoker that these witnesses would testify to\n\n        [a] number of specific instances in Mr. Collier's life, rescuing an individual from drowning,\n        his career in school [in South Pittsburgh], instances where we felt he had proven and that he\n        had made positive contributions to the community. Facts not relating to the crime itself but\n        facts relating to Mr. Collier's personality, his background. Facts relating to his diabetes and\n        the effect of diabetes on his behavior, when his blood sugar level would be out of balance.\n        And testimony showing the history of his living in that South Pittsburgh community.\n\nJudge Coker refused to allow the proffered testimony, responding, as Bennett related,\n\n        in no uncertain terms that we could not go into any evidence relating to the individual except\n        for opinion testimony as to his reputation for truth and veracity. He said this is a criminal\n        trial. You are bound by the rules of evidence. You can introduce evidence relating to the\n        crime itself but no specific facts, no individual opinions, nothing from the accused's\n        background.\n\nOn cross-examination, Bennett testified that Judge Coker told defense counsel on two occasions that\n\nthe evidence they could present would be limited—first, when Judge Coker met them out on the\n\n\n\n\nand his first state habeas corpus petition. Jay Bennett was the only member of the defense team\nwho testified at the October 14, 1982, evidentiary hearing.\n   10\n     Assistant District Attorney Gillenn attended a portion of the chambers conference to present\nthe State's position on the admissibility of Collier's Florida conviction for manslaughter, which\nthe State wished to introduce at the sentencing phase of the trial. According to Gillenn,\nmitigation evidence was not a topic of discussion while he was present.\n\n                                                   11\n\fstreet as he was walking to dinner, and again in the judge's chambers shortly before the trial\n\nresumed. On the latter occasion, the District Attorney was present.\n\n          After testifying, Jay Bennett called William Campbell to the stand to testify as to his\n\nrecollection of the events in question. Contrary to Bennett's assertions, Campbell testified that Judge\n\nCoker told defense counsel that he would give them wide latitude to present mitigating evidence.\n\nCampbell stated that \"[t]here was no way the Court held them to the rigid rules of evidence as to the\n\ncharacter witness [sic], period.\" Campbell testified that the judge's chambers conference with\n\ncounsel prior to the sentencing phase mainly concerned whether the State could present evidence\n\nof Collier's prior manslaughter conviction in Florida; Judge Coker ruled against him and excluded\n\nthe evidence. Judge Coker also instructed Campbell to \"sit pretty solemn and quiet\" during\n\nsentencing.11 Campbell noted that whereas he proffered the evidence (the conviction) he intended\n\nto introduce during the sentencing phase, defense counsel made no proffer of the evidence they\n\nintended to present; in fact, they did not reveal what they intended to present until their witnesses\n\ntook the stand.\n\n          Because of health problems, Judge Coker did not appear at the evidentiary hearing. He was\n\nable to appear for deposition the day after the hearing,12 however; his deposition was made part of\n\nthe evidentiary hearing and considered by the court. Judge Coker's memory of the off-the-record\n\nconversations with counsel differed substantially from Jay Bennett's. Judge Coker recalled the\n\n\n\n   11\n    On direct examination, Campbell agreed that there were a number of off-the-record\nconferences between the court and counsel. Most of these conferences were between the court\nand defense counsel, who repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea agreement under which\nCollier would receive a life sentence.\n   12\n        At the deposition, Donald Bennett appeared for Collier and questioned Judge Coker.\n\n                                                  12\n\foff-the-record chambers conference he convened between the guilt and sentencing phases of the\n\ntrial, and said that he probably advised counsel that the presentation of evidence at the sentencing\n\nphase would be \"governed primarily by the rules of evidence.\" He was certain, however, that, after\n\nthe trial resumed, he permitted defense counsel to go beyond the rules of evidence and to introduce\n\nevidence of Collier's family life and work habits, as well as whether or not Collier paid his bills on\n\ntime. His recollection was that defense counsel proffered as mitigating evidence no specific acts\n\nfrom Collier's past, and that he placed no limitation on what counsel could ask their witnesses.\n\nJudge Coker said that he had no idea of the testimony defense counsel intended to elicit from their\n\nwitnesses; his bottom line was, \"ask the question and then let me rule on it.\"\n\n        Despite holding an evidentiary hearing and taking extensive testimony regarding the\n\nexistence and substance of the off-the-record conference between Judge Coker and counsel, the\n\nsuperior court's order disposing of Collier's habeas petition said remarkably little about his Lockett\n\nclaim. The order merely noted that \"[t]he Supreme Court has concluded that the trial court did not\n\nerr in excluding certain evidence offered in mitigation.\" As for the new evidence adduced at the\n\nevidentiary hearing, including Judge Coker's deposition, the court concluded that the evidence failed\n\nto establish a Lockett violation.\n\n        Collier appealed the court's decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. That court, noting that\n\nthe \"record of the trial fails to disclose any offer of proof which was made relating to the restrictions\n\nallegedly placed on counsel,\" affirmed the lower court's ruling that Collier had not carried his burden\n\nof proving that the trial court, in an off-the-record ruling, had limited the mitigating evidence the\n\ndefense could bring before the jury. Collier v. Francis, 251 Ga. 512, 307 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1983).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n\f        Although Collier renewed his Lockett claim in his next two federal habeas corpus petitions,\n\nthe merits of the claim were not reached in either of those actions; both petitions were dismissed\n\non procedural grounds. The first federal court ruling on the merits of Collier's Lockett claim\n\ntherefore occurred in the district court proceeding now under review. Based upon its examination\n\nof the record developed by the Butts County Superior Court in October 1982, the district court found\n\nthat the testimony of Collier's attorney, Jay Bennett, the prosecuting attorneys, Campbell and\n\nGillenn, and Judge Coker all were credible.13 Because there was a direct conflict between the\n\nversion of the off-the-record conferences offered by defense counsel and the version recalled by\n\nJudge Coker and the prosecutors, the court found the evidence to be \"equal as to what occurred\"—in\n\nessence that the evidence was in equipoise—and therefore ruled as a matter of law that Collier had\n\nnot carried his burden of establishing a Lockett violation.\n\n        In reviewing a district court's resolution of a Lockett claim, we accept the district court's\n\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, and we review the court's conclusions of law de\n\nnovo. Respondent contends, in his brief to this court, that the district court's conclusion that the\n\nevidence bearing on Collier's Lockett claim was \"in equipoise\" is a factual determination, and thus\n\nsubject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. We believe that there is only one way in which\n\nevidence of a historical fact may be in equipoise. When a trial court is presented with circumstantial\n\nevidence that yields equal, opposing inferences, the evidence as to the inferential facts is in\n\n\n\n   13\n     At an evidentiary hearing held on January 27-28, 1994, the district court heard the testimony\nof two of Collier's trial attorneys, Jay Bennett—who had testified in the state habeas corpus\nproceeding in the Butts County Superior Court—and James Secord. The court disregarded their\ntestimony, however, choosing instead to rely on the cold record of the state proceeding. The\ndistrict court disregarded Bennett's and Secord's testimony because their testimony did not add to\nthe evidence developed in the state proceeding.\n\n                                                 14\n\fequipoise—neither inference is more likely to be true than the other. We are not presented with that\n\nsituation here. Instead, we are presented with a swearing match. One of Collier's trial attorneys\n\npresents one version of the off-the-record conferences that took place before the sentencing phase\n\nof the trial commenced; Judge Coker and the prosecutors present another. By finding that the\n\nversions presented by both sides of the dispute were \"credible,\" and that the evidence as to what\n\ntranspired at the conference was therefore in equipoise, the district court made no factual\n\ndetermination at all. The evidence offered by both sides constituted direct, not circumstantial,\n\nevidence, and a fact finding required a choice between the two contradictory versions of events.\n\nBecause the district court did not make such a choice, its determination that the evidence is \"in\n\nequipoise\" is entitled to no deference.14\n\n        Ordinarily, we would remand the case to the district court and instruct it to make a credibility\n\nchoice and resolve the dispute. Because in our view only one credibility choice is reasonable given\n\nthe record this case presents, however, we forego a remand and proceed to decide both the Lockett\n\nissue and Collier's claim that his attorney's performance failed to pass constitutional muster.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n        We first note that it is difficult to believe, as Jay Bennett asserted in his testimony before\n\nthe Butts County Superior Court, that Judge Coker would have prohibited Collier's attorneys from\n\npresenting any evidence of character other than Collier's reputation in the community for truth and\n\nveracity. Collier did not testify in either the guilt phase or the sentencing phase of the trial; thus,\n\n\n\n   14\n     In effect, the district court fashioned the following rule to deny Collier relief on his claim:\nif the court (in a bench trial) could reasonably believe the testimony offered by both sides of an\nissue, the court need not decide which testimony is true—because the evidence is in\nequipoise—and the party with the burden of proof loses.\n\n                                                  15\n\fhis reputation for truth and veracity was entirely irrelevant.15 Such a limitation by the trial judge\n\nwould not simply have violated Lockett, it would have been absurd. Nevertheless, given the\n\nconflicting accounts provided by Jay Bennett on the one hand, and Judge Coker, Campbell, and\n\nGillenn on the other, we look to the transcript of the sentencing phase of the trial for evidence that\n\nmight shed light on what Judge Coker actually said to defense counsel off the record.\n\n        Collier contends that statements made by Judge Coker on the record following the\n\nprosecutor's objection to the testimony of his third witness, Shelly Jordan—that he had \"mutual\n\nrespect\" for Collier—support his claim that the judge improperly limited the mitigation evidence his\n\nattorneys could present. The transcript reveals that Collier's counsel began the sentencing phase by\n\nasking the first two witnesses a few brief questions about their personal history and association with\n\nCollier, and then about Collier's reputation in the community for truth and veracity, whether the\n\nwitness would believe Mr. Collier under oath, and little else.16 The third witness called to the stand\n\nwas Shelly Jordan. Donald Bennett began the direct examination of the witness by asking\n\nfoundational questions, apparently as a predicate to inquiring about Collier's reputation. The\n\nfollowing transpired:\n\n        MR. BENNETT: What has been your association with Mr. Collier?\n\n\n\n\n   15\n    The indictment in this case did not charge Collier with perjury or some other false statement\noffense as to which his reputation for truth and veracity would be relevant. The only statement\nmade by Collier that was before the jury was his confession to the crimes of murder, aggravated\nassault, and armed robbery. By presenting evidence of Collier's reputation for truth and veracity,\nCollier's attorneys actually buttressed his confession that he committed those crimes.\n   16\n     Donald Bennett did ask the first two witnesses whether they considered Collier's character,\ngenerally, to be \"good\" or \"bad,\" in addition to the questions about his reputation for\ntruthfulness.\n\n                                                 16\n\f       MR. JORDAN: Well, we were always close friends, and always got along well, and had a\n             lot of mutual respect for each other.\n\n       MR. BENNETT: Do you have that respect for him now?\n\n       MR. CAMPBELL: Your Honor, I object at this time, it's not what he thinks of him.\n\n       THE COURT: I believe you've gone a little far afield, as to his feeling for the defendant.\n\n       MR. CAMPBELL: It's whether he knows him in the community where he lives, and not\n            what he thinks about him, but what the people in that community, it's not what he\n            thinks, it's what the people in the community think.\n\n       THE COURT: I think you should be a little more limited in your examination of the\n            witnesses relative to anything in mitigation.\n\n       MR. BENNETT: Is it Your Honor's ruling that I cannot ask him his personal opinion as to\n            what he thinks of this defendant?\n\n       THE COURT: His reputation in the community.\n\n(emphasis added). In the ensuing conversation, which took place outside the presence of the jury\n\nbut on the record, Judge Coker acknowledged that there had been some discussion with counsel\n\nprior to the sentencing phase about the evidence the defense could offer. In contrast to Jay Bennett's\n\ntestimony (at the habeas hearing before the Butts County Superior Court) that Judge Coker told\n\nCollier's counsel what evidence they could present, however, Judge Coker said, \"I know what you\n\ntold me you were going to do, and I felt it might be all right in a case like this.\" Moreover, Judge\n\nCoker's statements on the record belie Bennett's statement that Judge Coker restricted the testimony\n\nto Collier's reputation in the community for truth and veracity and evidence in mitigation of the\n\ncrime itself. Judge Coker said:\n\n       I told you that these things that [are] admissible, it's about his reputation in the community\n       for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things like that, I think that\n       would be mitigating, but because you might have a mutual admiration for him, that is not a\n       mitigating circumstance, and I am going to rule that personal thoughts of him, whether\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f       they're good friends or buddies, it doesn't really have any bearing on the issues, that's what\n       I'm trying to say.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       As is apparent from this statement, Judge Coker felt that the testimony regarding the witness'\n\n\"mutual respect\" for Collier was not mitigating evidence. He repeatedly inquired of Donald Bennett\n\nas to how the evidence was mitigating, stating several times that he, personally, did not think that\n\nthe evidence was relevant. In addition, Judge Coker asked how the proffered testimony was in\n\n\"mitigation or extenuation of punishment,\" not of the crime itself. Although there are indications\n\nin the sentencing phase transcript that Judge Coker felt that he was generally bound by the rules of\n\nevidence (in fact, he admitted as much during his deposition in the state habeas proceeding), there\n\nare ample indications that Judge Coker was willing to accept evidence that would not be admissible\n\nunder a strict application of the rules of evidence.\n\n       Finally, we note that Donald Bennett asked Judge Coker whether he could ask other\n\nwitnesses the question he had put to Shelly Jordan without being \"criticized\" by the court. Judge\n\nCoker, as he testified was his practice, responded: \"I think you'll need to ask the question before I\n\nmake a determination as to whether it's in mitigation or not, whether it complies with the rules of\n\nevidence.\" Bennett did not ask the question again, nor did he make a proffer of any testimony he\n\nthought Judge Coker had excluded during the off-the-record chambers conference held before the\n\nsentencing phase commenced. This is not a surprising result, given that Judge Coker did not limit\n\nor exclude any of the mitigation evidence, other than Shelly Jordan's statement that he had \"mutual\n\nrespect\" for Collier, that the defense team endeavored to bring before the jury. If Judge Coker had\n\nlimited the presentation of mitigating evidence in the way Bennett claims, he likely would have\n\nexcluded other evidence offered by the defense during the sentencing phase; that he did not exclude\n\n                                                 18\n\fother evidence during the sentencing phase suggests that no such limitations were placed on the\n\ndefense during the pre-sentencing phase conference.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n       We conclude that the record does not support Collier's claim that the trial court improperly\n\nlimited the scope of the evidence the defense team could offer in mitigation during the sentencing\n\nphase of the trial. Although the record suggests that defense counsel may have been confused about\n\nthe extent of the testimony the court would allow them to elicit from their witnesses, and that the\n\ncourt may have had a more narrow view than Lockett embraced concerning the sort of evidence that\n\ncould appropriately be admitted during the sentencing phase of a capital case, the evidence does not\n\nsupport Jay Bennett's position that Judge Coker told the defense team that all he would allow would\n\nbe testimony of Collier's reputation in the community for truth and veracity and evidence of acts\n\nmitigating the crime itself. As noted above, the only evidence Judge Coker excluded was Shelly\n\nJordan's statement that he had \"mutual respect\" for Collier—testimony which, although largely\n\nirrelevant, arguably should have been admitted given the broad latitude accorded to capital\n\ndefendants to present mitigation evidence. Furthermore, Judge Coker's on-the-record statements as\n\nto the evidence that, in his view, would constitute mitigating evidence seriously undermines Jay\n\nBennett's claim that the only evidence that could be introduced was testimony of Collier's reputation\n\nfor truth and veracity and evidence in mitigation of the crime itself. Collier's Lockett claim\n\naccordingly fails.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        Collier claims, alternatively, that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. First, Collier contends that his attorneys were\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fineffective because their investigation in preparation for the sentencing phase was deficient; they\n\nfailed to interview and present testimony from numerous close personal friends and relatives who\n\ncould have provided persuasive mitigating evidence, and they failed to explore and present readily\n\navailable expert opinion evidence regarding his diabetes and diffuse organic brain damage. Second,\n\nCollier contends that counsels' actual presentation at the sentencing phase of trial was ineffective\n\nin that they failed to elicit, from the witnesses who did testify, anecdotal evidence regarding his\n\npersonal history, diabetic condition, and specific circumstances bearing on the robberies and murder\n\nthat would have effectively foreclosed the death sentence. Collier contends that his attorneys also\n\nwere ineffective because they failed to object on the record to the court's perceived (by them)\n\nlimitation of mitigation evidence and failed to make an offer of proof as to what his witnesses would\n\nhave said had they been permitted to testify.17\n\n                                                   1.\n\n        The first time Collier alleged that his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nduring the sentencing phase was in his first state habeas petition. At that time, Collier was still being\n\nrepresented by his defense team. Not surprisingly, then, the claim was not premised upon volitional\n\n\n   17\n     In a residual clause in his brief encompassing all of the claims that he presented to the\ndistrict court but, due to space limitation, he was unable to include in his brief, Collier\nincorporated several other grounds for his ineffective assistance claim. To the extent those\ngrounds relate to counsels' alleged ineffectiveness during the guilt phase of the trial, we believe\nthat the district court properly disposed of them. Our finding that Collier has not demonstrated\nthat his counsel were ineffective in the guilt phase does not affect our examination of their\nperformance in the sentencing phase. We evaluate the attorneys' performances during each\n\"discreet portion[ ] of a trial without regard to the attorney[s'] performance[s] at other points\nduring the trial.\" Horton v. Zant, 941 F.2d 1449, 1461 (11th Cir.1991).\n\n               With respect to the additional examples of ineffective assistance in the sentencing\n        phase that Collier presented in this \"catch-all\" residual clause, we need not consider them\n        given our holding that counsel were ineffective in the sentencing phase.\n\n                                                   20\n\fineffectiveness of trial counsel, but rather upon the same allegations that underpinned his Lockett\n\nclaim—that Judge Coker rendered counsel ineffective when he precluded counsel in an\n\noff-the-record ruling from presenting any substantial mitigating evidence. As it did with Collier's\n\nLockett claim, the state habeas court concluded that Collier had not carried his burden of proof on\n\nthis ineffective assistance claim. Collier, still represented by his defense team, see supra note 9,\n\npresented the same claim in his second federal habeas petition, but the petition was dismissed\n\nbecause Collier had not exhausted his state remedies with respect to all of his claims.\n\n        Collier parted ways with his defense team before filing his second state habeas petition, thus\n\npaving the way for new counsel to claim that Collier's defense counsel rendered ineffective\n\nassistance in the sentencing phase of his trial. The petition alleged that counsel were ineffective for\n\nfailing to present \"mitigating evidence that would have convinced the jury that Petitioner was not\n\n\"some huge, black man,' as the prosecuting attorney frequently referred to Petitioner, with an evil\n\nand malicious heart that deserved to die.\" According to the petition, a wealth of evidence was\n\navailable to demonstrate that Collier was a good family man, an upstanding public citizen willing\n\nto risk his own injury to help others, and that he was a diabetic who had trouble controlling his\n\nbehavior when he was not properly medicated. The state habeas court concluded that the doctrine\n\nof res judicata precluded it from considering Collier's claim since the claim had been raised in his\n\nfirst state habeas petition. The court concluded, alternatively, that Collier had waived any claim of\n\nineffective assistance that he had not raised in his first state habeas petition.\n\n        In Collier's third federal habeas petition, he raised both claims of ineffective assistance: (1)\n\nthat the trial court's off-the-record-evidentiary ruling had rendered counsel ineffective; and (2) that\n\ncounsel were independently ineffective for not objecting on the record to that ruling and for failing\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fto present efficacious mitigating evidence. The district court dismissed the petition without\n\nprejudice because Collier had not exhausted all of his state law claims. In his third and last state\n\nhabeas petition, Collier again alleged that his attorneys' performance was ineffective, calling the\n\ncourt's attention to two aspects of counsels' performance that were deficient. The court found that\n\nboth had been raised—albeit in different forms—in earlier state petitions and disposed of, and that\n\nthe earlier dispositions were res judicata.\n\n       Returning to federal court, Collier once again raised his claim of ineffective assistance in his\n\nfourth habeas petition—the petition under review.           The respondent contends that Collier\n\nprocedurally defaulted his claim because he did not assert it until his second state habeas petition.\n\nThe district court agreed with respondent and applied the \"cause and prejudice\" test to determine\n\nwhether Collier's failure to follow the applicable state procedural rules precluded his claim. See\n\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 86-87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (applying the\n\nrule from Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976), which\n\nestablished that petitioners who raise claims in federal habeas corpus petitions that are barred by\n\nstate doctrines of procedural waiver must establish \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" for their failure to raise\n\nthe claims in state court). The court held that Collier had demonstrated sufficient cause by the fact\n\nthat he was represented on his first state habeas petition by trial counsel. See Stephens v. Kemp, 846\n\nF.2d 642, 651 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that a habeas corpus petitioner who did not raise an\n\nineffective assistance claim in his first state habeas petition satisfied the cause prong of the cause\n\nand prejudice test when counsel on the first state habeas petition was also trial counsel whose\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fperformance was allegedly inadequate).18 The court then evaluated Collier's claim on the merits to\n\ndetermine whether he had established the prejudice prong of the test as well.\n\n        In its dispositive order of February 28, 1995, the district court ruled that Collier's counsel\n\nwere not ineffective. The court held that they had pursued a reasonable strategy in investigating and\n\ndeveloping mitigating evidence, and could not be faulted for failing to pursue additional anecdotal\n\nevidence of Collier's personal history, diabetic condition, or circumstances leading up to the crimes.\n\nAdditionally, the court ruled that Collier's counsel were not unreasonable for neglecting to obtain\n\nexpert opinion testimony regarding his diabetes and the affect of abnormal blood sugar levels on\n\nCollier's ability to control his behavior as well as expert opinion testimony concerning diffuse\n\norganic brain damage. The district court also held that if the trial court had restricted counsels'\n\nability to present mitigating evidence during an off-the-record conference prior to sentencing, in\n\ncontravention of Lockett, counsel were not \"unreasonable in their beliefs that they had preserved this\n\nissue for appellate review.\" Finally, the court stated that it was \"not persuaded that even if Collier's\n\ntrial attorneys had done all that his current counsel contend should have been done the outcome of\n\nthe sentencing phase would be different.\"\n\n                                                  2.\n\n        Whether a criminal defendant has received the effective assistance of counsel is a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact and is subject to de novo review. See Bolender v. Singletary, 16 F.3d 1547,\n\n1558 n. 12 (11th Cir.1994). \"[S]tate court findings of historical facts made in the course of\n\nevaluating an ineffectiveness claim are subject to the presumption of correctness, and similar federal\n\n\n   18\n     We note that, in his brief, respondent has not questioned the district court's treatment of\nCollier's procedural default, and therefore we do not address the merits of the procedural default\nissue.\n\n                                                  23\n\fdistrict court findings are deemed correct ... unless clearly erroneous.\" Id. (citing Bush v. Singletary,\n\n988 F.2d 1082, 1089 (11th Cir.1993)) (citation omitted). The test for whether counsel has provided\n\nthe effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments was\n\narticulated by the Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80\n\nL.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under Strickland, a person asserting a claim of ineffective assistance must\n\nsatisfy a two prong test:\n\n        First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires\n        showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n        \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must\n        show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that\n        counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result\n        is reliable.\n\nId. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. In a capital case, this two part test applies to claims of ineffective\n\nassistance during the sentencing phase as well as the guilt phase of the trial, because a \"capital\n\nsentencing proceeding ... is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of\n\nstandards for decision ... that counsel's role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel's role at\n\ntrial—to ensure that the adversarial testing process works to produce a just result under the standards\n\ngoverning decision.\" Id. at 686-87, 104 S.Ct. at 2064 (citations omitted).\n\n        In subpart i, we examine Collier's claims of ineffective assistance to determine whether he\n\nhas satisfied the performance prong of the Strickland test. In subpart ii, we determine whether\n\nCollier has demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced by the acts and omissions of his attorneys.\n\n                                                    i.\n\n        In order to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel were ineffective, Collier\n\nmust demonstrate that their \"representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Id.\n\nat 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The performance inquiry thus seeks to determine whether, under\n\n                                                   24\n\f\"prevailing professional norms,\" counsel's \"assistance was reasonable considering all the\n\ncircumstances.\" Id., 104 S.Ct. at 2065. In evaluating Collier's ineffective assistance claim, we must\n\ngive great deference to counsels' choice of strategy and execution. Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065\n\n(discussing the danger of hindsight in such an evaluation and noting that the defendant must\n\novercome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \"might be considered\n\nsound trial strategy\") (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 164, 100 L.Ed.\n\n83 (1955)). With these principles in mind, we first examine counsels' investigation in preparation\n\nfor the sentencing phase, and then their presentation of mitigating evidence before the jury.\n\n                                                   a.\n\n       Collier raises two distinct claims of ineffective assistance based on his counsels' failure to\n\ninvestigate more fully his personal history as well as his medical and mental condition at the time\n\nof the crimes. First, he contends that his attorneys failed to interview close relatives and friends who\n\ncould have provided an abundance of information regarding his childhood, economic circumstances\n\nsurrounding his upbringing, social environment in his hometown, diabetic condition as well as\n\nattendant physical and emotional problems, and specific events in his life that would have mitigated\n\nthe sentence imposed by the jury. Second, Collier claims that his attorneys failed to pursue expert\n\nopinion testimony relating to his diabetes and to \"diffuse organic brain damage.\" According to\n\nCollier, such testimony should have been proffered during the sentencing phase to show his reduced\n\ncapacity to conform his behavior to the law, even if such testimony could not support a legal defense\n\nto the crimes themselves.\n\n        With regard to Collier's first claim—that counsel failed to interview a number of close\n\nrelatives and friends of Collier that could have provided additional evidence to be used in the\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fsentencing phase of his trial—the district court found that counsels' failure to pursue those witnesses'\n\ntestimony was the direct result of a conscious tactical decision. \"The question of whether a decision\n\nby counsel was a tactical one is a question of fact.\" Bolender, 16 F.3d at 1558 n. 12 (citing Horton,\n\n941 F.2d at 1462). Whether the tactic was reasonable, however, is a question of law and is reviewed\n\nde novo. See Horton, 941 F.2d at 1462. In assessing the reasonableness of the tactic, we consider\n\n\"all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments.\" Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.\n\n        Jay Bennett testified that the defense team thought that if they \"could bring out just exactly\n\nwhat the so-called better class of the community over in Jasper and South Pittsburgh thought about\n\n[Collier], well, that surely the jury would give some consideration to that.\" Collier's lead defense\n\nattorney, Donald Bennett, was from the largely rural area in which the trial was held, and was\n\nfamiliar with the attitudes of the local citizenry. He was well-positioned, therefore, to determine\n\nwhat testimony would be most well-received by the jury. Bennett believed that the jury would be\n\nable to relate to witnesses representing the \"governing part of the city.\" In addition, counsel thought\n\nthey were limited in the number of witnesses they could present; the out-of-state witnesses from\n\nCollier's hometown in Tennessee had to be subpoenaed, court orders for their appearance had to be\n\nobtained, and witness fees had to be tendered. Donald Bennett traveled to South Pittsburgh and\n\nJasper and interviewed quite a few potential witnesses, including Collier's wife. From those he\n\nselected fourteen to subpoena for trial, ten of whom were called to testify. They included Collier's\n\nwife, a lifelong friend, people from South Pittsburgh for or with whom Collier had worked and had\n\nknown for twenty years or more, the principal of Collier's high school, a member of the South\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fPittsburgh City Commission, and a friend of Collier's father's who had known Collier since he was\n\na child.\n\n           As the district court noted, the witnesses whom counsel selected to testify possessed much\n\nof the information about Collier's past and character that Collier now contends should have been\n\npresented to the jury.19 Although we might think that it would have been more prudent for Collier's\n\nattorneys to investigate other possible avenues for obtaining information about Collier's character\n\nand background, including Collier's relatives and close friends, \"in considering claims of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, \"[w]e address not what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is\n\nconstitutionally compelled.' \" Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 794, 107 S.Ct. 3114, 3126, 97 L.Ed.2d\n\n638 (1987) (quoting United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 665 n. 38, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2050 n. 38,\n\n80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)). Considering all of the circumstances from the position of Collier's counsel\n\nat the time of their conduct, see Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, we cannot conclude\n\n\n\n\n   19\n     The witnesses whom counsel called to the stand could have testified that Collier's mother\ndied when he was an infant, and that while his father left him in the care of his aunt and uncle to\nraise, he kept Collier's older brother, and later remarried and had three more children. They\ncould have testified about Collier's upbringing as a poor black child in a segregated southern\ntown and about his gentle disposition despite his large stature; that Collier worked from an early\nage to help support himself and his aunt and uncle; that he persevered in school despite being a\nslow learner, becoming a football star in high school and then seeing his career end due to an\ninjury during his senior year; and that he moved to Seattle after a stint in the army, and then\nreturned to South Pittsburgh to take care of the aunt who had raised him while she was dying of\ncancer. The witnesses could have testified that Collier started a family upon his return to South\nPittsburgh; that he was a devoted father and husband; that he worked hard to provide for his\nfamily; and that, about a month before he committed the crimes in this case, he lost his job with\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority and was nearly out of money when he committed them. At least\none witness, in addition to Collier's wife, could have testified about Collier's heroic attempt to\nsave the life of a motorist trapped in a car that had veered off a bridge into a creek. Finally,\nseveral witnesses, and especially Collier's wife, could have testified that Collier was diabetic and\nthat he was moody and irrational when he had either not taken his insulin or missed a meal.\n\n                                                  27\n\fthat counsel were ineffective for failing to interview additional potential witnesses in preparation\n\nfor the sentencing phase.\n\n        Collier's second contention is that counsel were ineffective for not pursuing expert opinions\n\non the effects of diabetes and \"diffuse organic brain damage\" upon Collier's ability to control his\n\nbehavior. These omissions are not premised upon any tactical choice of defense counsel. We\n\ntherefore review the record to determine whether counsels' failure to obtain expert opinions fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness, taking into consideration all the circumstances at the\n\ntime.\n\n        We find it easy to dispose of Collier's argument that his attorneys should have obtained\n\nexpert opinion testimony as to whether Collier was suffering from \"diffuse organic brain damage\"\n\nwhen the offenses occurred and whether any such brain damage would have affected his ability to\n\ncontrol his behavior. To support his claim in the district court, Collier presented the testimony of\n\na neuropsychologist, Dr. Joyce Carbonell, in which she stated that he suffered from \"diffuse organic\n\nbrain damage.\" Although counsel were aware before and during the trial that Collier was a \"slow\n\nlearner,\" and had difficulty reading and writing, they also knew that he had graduated from high\n\nschool, held steady employment, and raised a family. In addition, Collier's expert on diabetes, Dr.\n\nBuris Boshell, testified that he did not see any clear evidence of brain damage, and that during the\n\ninterview Collier was \"lucid and well-oriented.\" We agree with the district court's conclusion that\n\n\"there is nothing in the record to show how [knowledge that Collier was a slow learner] would have\n\nled a reasonable attorney in 1978 to believe that Collier was suffering from any kind of brain\n\ndamage.\" We therefore find that it was not unreasonable for counsel to fail to investigate the\n\npotential influence of \"diffuse organic brain damage\" upon Collier's behavior.\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f        Collier also contends that counsel were ineffective in their investigation for failing to obtain\n\nthe services of a diabetes expert to examine Collier and testify in the sentencing phase of the trial.\n\nIn Dr. Buris Boshell's opinion, Collier was suffering from acute hypoglycemia when he committed\n\nthe crimes in this case. The district court nevertheless held that counsel were not ineffective for\n\nfailing to obtain and present such opinion testimony. In making this determination, the court did not\n\napply the performance prong of the test from Strickland. Instead, finding it dispositive, the court\n\napplied the prejudice prong of the test as we had applied it in Elledge v. Dugger, 823 F.2d 1439,\n\n1445-48 (11th Cir.1987) (assessing a claim that counsel failed to procure an expert witness) and held\n\nthat Collier had not in fact been prejudiced.20 We conclude that Collier has demonstrated that\n\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to obtain an expert on diabetes. Evaluating counsels' omission\n\nin light of all the circumstances, competent counsel would have pursued an expert opinion on the\n\nrole that Collier's diabetes may have played in the criminal activity.\n\n        Our holding that counsel should have sought the opinion of an expert on diabetes is premised\n\nupon a number of established facts. First, counsel were aware that Collier's behavior was entirely\n\nout of character for a man who was universally described as gentle, respectful, and hardworking by\n\nthose who knew him. Second, Jay Bennett testified that the defense team was aware of Collier's\n\ndiabetes. Third, James Secord testified that not only did the defense team know that Collier had\n\ndiabetes, they intended to present evidence to the jury that Collier either was not receiving the\n\ncorrect dosage of insulin or had not had his insulin shot on the day of the crimes. As Secord stated,\n\n\"this might possibly have been a factor that would have altered his motivation or altered his\n\n\n   20\n     We disagree with the district court's finding that Collier was not prejudiced by counsels'\nfailure to obtain an expert witness to evaluate Collier and testify in the sentencing phase, but we\nreserve our discussion of prejudice for subpart ii of this opinion.\n\n                                                  29\n\fperception at the time and I remember that being to me an important aspect to get before the jury.\"\n\nFinally, counsel had very little evidence that mitigated the crime itself; evidence of Collier's\n\ndiabetes, and the affects upon his behavior of a chemical imbalance caused by improper medication,\n\nlikely would have constituted his strongest evidence mitigating the crimes Collier committed in this\n\ncase. We are mindful of the need to avoid evaluating the performance of counsel with the benefit\n\nof hindsight, but even in 1978 reasonable counsel would at least have sought an expert's opinion on\n\nthis issue. Counsel were thus ineffective for failing to pursue an expert on diabetes to examine\n\nCollier and testify at the sentencing phase.\n\n                                                  b.\n\n        We next evaluate counsels' performance during the actual sentencing phase of the trial. Jay\n\nBennett testified that the defense team \"knew from the start that the whole case was going to ride\n\non the sentencing phase.\" The team's conclusion is not surprising considering that Collier had been\n\ntied clearly to the crimes by eyewitness accounts, had given a full confession to authorities, and\n\nseemed to be of reasonable mental health. In fact, counsel considered having Collier plead guilty\n\nand then proceeding directly to the sentencing phase; William Campbell testified that Collier's\n\ndefense team repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea of guilty in exchange for a life sentence.\n\nIn short, Collier's attorneys intended to focus their efforts on presenting evidence that would mitigate\n\nCollier's sentence.\n\n       Counsels' intention of presenting a strong case in mitigation stands in stark contrast to the\n\npresentation that actually took place. After briefly summarizing the testimony that counsel adduced\n\nfrom Collier's ten mitigation witnesses, we then analyze whether counsels' performance fell below\n\nthe objective standard of reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. As noted supra, Collier\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fbased his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on two alternative theories: (1) that his\n\nattorneys' conduct was constitutionally deficient, or (2) that counsels' performance was rendered\n\nineffective by Judge Coker's ruling limiting the mitigating evidence counsel could present. The\n\nsecond theory, the Lockett claim, fails for the reasons stated in subpart A, supra. As for Collier's\n\nfirst theory, we conclude that counsels' performance did not comport with the standards of the\n\nprofession and was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances; hence, the performance\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n        The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night.21 The defense team called ten\n\nwitnesses to the stand. Despite their acknowledgment that the sentencing phase was the most\n\nimportant part of the trial, their examination of the witnesses was minimal. Counsel sought to elicit\n\nvery little relevant evidence about Collier's character. In fact, with respect to a number of witnesses,\n\ncounsel sought only their opinion of Collier's reputation for truth and veracity—a matter wholly\n\nirrelevant to the issue before the jury.22 Furthermore, even when counsel departed from the\n\n\n   21\n     The District Attorney, William Campbell, testified in the habeas hearing in the Butts County\nSuperior Court that neither party objected to beginning the sentencing phase at that hour,\nalthough both he and Donald Bennett were tired. They did not object because the two men\nstruck a deal; Campbell's assistant, Craig Gillenn, would make the State's closing argument to\nthe jury, and Bennett's assistant, James Secord, would present Collier's argument.\n   22\n     We note that Judge Coker actually prompted Donald Bennett to ask other questions of\nCollier's witnesses; the judge reminded Bennett of his earlier advice—that Collier's reputation\n\"for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things like that\" would be\nrelevant mitigating evidence. Despite Judge Coker's prompting, and his admonition at the\nconclusion of the colloquy over witness Shelly Jordan's \"mutual respect\" testimony, that Bennett\nwould need to ask questions before the court could rule on the admissibility of the testimony\nsuch questions would elicit, Bennett's direct examination of subsequent defense witnesses failed\nto explore in any significant way the witnesses' knowledge of Collier. Bennett raced through the\nremaining witnesses, eliciting very little in the way of mitigating evidence from any of them, and\nnot once making a proffer of additional evidence in response to what he perceived to be an\nadverse exclusionary ruling by the court.\n\n                                                  31\n\ftruth-and-veracity line of questioning, the testimony elicited was of a nature that could not\n\nreasonably have aided the jury in its sentence determination.\n\n        For instance, Collier's eighth witness was his wife, Mary Collier. After establishing that\n\nCollier and Mary had been married five years and had two children, both boys, ages three and five,\n\nthe remainder of her direct examination consisted of the following:\n\n        MR. BENNETT: And since you have been married, has Robert supported his family?\n\n        MRS. COLLIER: Yes, he has.\n\n        MR. BENNETT: Has he been a hard worker?\n\n        MRS. COLLIER: Yes, sir.\n\n        MR. BENNETT: I believe that's all I need to ask her.\n\nOn cross-examination, the prosecution had Mary Collier testify that she received $70 from Collier\n\non the day of the crimes, money that she now knew he had stolen from the floral shop. On re-direct\n\nexamination, Donald Bennett established that she was not aware of the crimes when she accepted\n\nthe money.\n\n        Counsel elicited little more mitigation testimony of substance from the other nine witnesses\n\ncalled on Collier's behalf. After the presentation of mitigating evidence ended, the court declared\n\na brief recess. Following the recess, counsel delivered their closing arguments, and the court\n\ncharged the jury. The jury retired to deliberate at 9:28 p.m. At 12:05 a.m. the next morning, the jury\n\nreturned its verdict.\n\n        In analyzing this claim of ineffective counsel, we note that defense counsel did elicit\n\ntestimony that Collier had a \"good\" reputation, that he was generally known as a hard worker who\n\ntook care of his family, and that he had a good reputation for truth and veracity. The trial transcript,\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fhowever, does not support the proposition that counsels' performance met the standard of objective\n\nreasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. Counsel presented no more than a hollow shell\n\nof the testimony necessary for a \"particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character\n\nand record of [a] convicted defendant before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death.\"\n\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976).\n\nAlthough counsel were aware of the Supreme Court's opinion in Lockett, and recognized that the\n\nsentencing phase was the most important part of the trial given the overwhelming evidence of guilt,\n\nthey presented almost none of the readily available evidence of Collier's background and character\n\nthat would have led the jury to eschew the death penalty. Instead of developing an image of Collier\n\nas a human being who was generally a good family man and a good public citizen, who had a\n\nbackground of poverty but who had worked hard as a child and as an adult to support his family and\n\nclose relatives, counsels' presentation tended to give the impression that the witnesses knew little\n\nor nothing about Collier. In failing to present any of the available evidence of Collier's upbringing,\n\nhis gentle disposition, his record of helping family in times of need, specific instances of his heroism\n\nand compassion, and evidence of his circumstances at the time of the crimes—including his recent\n\nloss of his job, his poverty, and his diabetic condition—counsels' performance brought into question\n\nthe reliability of the jury's determination that death was the appropriate sentence. See Woodson, 428\n\nU.S. at 305, 96 S.Ct. at 2991 (noting the qualitative difference in the need for reliability in a jury's\n\ndetermination that death is appropriate in a capital case).\n\n       Although Collier's attorneys concede that their performance was deficient, they blame the\n\ntrial judge rather than themselves for their poor display. We find that the trial judge was not to\n\nblame for counsels' ineffectiveness; rather, they were. In sum, counsel did not perform as\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fobjectively reasonable attorneys would have; their performance fell below the standards of the\n\nprofession and therefore their assistance at the sentencing phase of the trial was ineffective.\n\n                                                  ii.\n\n         Being satisfied that Collier has demonstrated that his attorneys' performance at the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial fell below the standard or reasonableness required by the Sixth\n\nAmendment, we must now determine whether counsels' inadequate performance during the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial prejudiced Collier. The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he purpose\n\nof the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance\n\nnecessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691-92, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 2067. To satisfy the prejudice prong of the analysis, therefore, \"[t]he defendant must show\n\nthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.\n\n        In this circuit, in order to prove that he has been prejudiced by counsel's failure to obtain\n\nexpert opinion testimony, a defendant must show not only that there is a reasonable probability that\n\nan impartial decisionmaker presented with the expert's testimony would reach a different conclusion,\n\nbut also \"what kind of, and how much, investigation an ordinary, reasonable lawyer would have\n\nundertaken ... [and] that it is reasonably probable that a reasonable investigation would have turned\n\nup an expert who would have presented testimony similar to that adduced.\" Elledge, 823 F.2d at\n\n1446 n. 15. Dr. Boshell testified that a local physician in 1978 would probably not have recognized\n\na possible relationship between Collier's actions on the day of the crimes and a potential episode of\n\nhypoglycemia brought on by Collier's not eating on that day in combination with his excessive\n\n\n                                                  34\n\finsulin dosage. Relying on this testimony, the district court held that it would have been reasonable\n\nfor an attorney in 1978 to forego seeking an expert on diabetes. The court found that Collier had\n\nnot \"shown that a reasonable attorney in 1978 would have investigated beyond asking local\n\nphysicians about diabetes and its possible effect on a person,\" and those physicians were unlikely\n\nto recognize the need for a specialist.\n\n        We disagree with the district court's conclusion that Collier has not demonstrated that he was\n\nprejudiced by counsels' failure to seek out an expert in diabetes. Dr. Boshell testified that either an\n\nendocrinologist, a specialist who studies diseases—like diabetes—that result from abnormalities in\n\nthe endocrine glands, or a neurologist could have made the connection between Collier's medical\n\ncondition and his actions on the day of the crimes. Although a general practitioner might not have\n\nrecognized the connection between diabetes and Collier's behavior, nor the excessive size of his\n\ninsulin dosage, a general practitioner is not an expert on diabetes. We see no reason why Collier's\n\ncounsel could not have obtained the name and phone number of an endocrinologist from either the\n\nphone book or from another physician and have had that specialist both examine Collier and provide\n\ntestimony at the sentencing phase of his trial.23 Dr. Boshell testified that the school of thought upon\n\nwhich he based his opinions had been popular since the 1950s, and therefore, experts sharing his\n\nopinions were not difficult to locate at the time of Collier's trial. Dr. Boshell himself, who practiced\n\nand taught medicine at the University of Alabama, would have been available and would have\n\ntestified the same way in 1978. Given that at least one member of Collier's defense team testified\n\nthat they intended to present non-expert evidence of Collier's diabetes and its possible effect on his\n\n\n   23\n     We imagine that a competent local physician, when questioned about a medical condition\nwith which he or she was unfamiliar, would refer the questioner to a specialist with competence\nin that area.\n\n                                                  35\n\fbehavior, we find that it was unreasonable for Collier's counsel to fail to contact an endocrinologist\n\nwho could have testified about the effect of diabetes on Collier's behavior. We also find that an\n\nordinary, reasonable lawyer would have called an endocrinologist and that it is reasonably probable\n\nthat such an investigation would have led to an expert who would have presented testimony similar\n\nto Dr. Boshell's.\n\n        The final part of the test for determining whether a defendant has been prejudiced by the\n\nfailure of counsel to locate an expert—whether defendant has shown that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the testimony would affect the sentence imposed, see Elledge, 823 F.2d at 1446 n.\n\n15—is the same for counsel's failure to develop and present non-expert testimony. Because a court\n\n\"must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury\" in determining whether a\n\ndefendant has shown that counsel's deficient performance was prejudicial, see Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, we examine counsels' failure to present expert testimony on Collier's\n\ndiabetes together with their failure to present other mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase\n\nof the trial in order to see if Collier has satisfied the second prong of the Strickland test.\n\n        Collier has sufficiently demonstrated that the failure of his counsel to make an offer of proof\n\non the record, or effectively to present at sentencing the wealth of mitigating evidence (including\n\nexpert testimony), creates a reasonable probability that, but for their errors, he would not have\n\nreceived a death sentence. \"The purpose of a sentencing hearing is to provide the jury with the\n\ninformation necessary for it to render an individualized sentencing determination ... [based upon]\n\nthe character and record of the individualized offender and the circumstances of the particular\n\noffense.\" Dobbs v. Turpin, 142 F.3d 1383, 1386-87 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted). The errors of Collier's counsel in the sentencing phase frustrated that purpose;\n\n\n                                                  36\n\fcounsel presented ten separate witnesses, including Collier's wife, whose relevant testimony\n\nconsisted almost entirely of one or two word answers to inquiries as to Collier's general reputation\n\nin the community, his reputation for truth and veracity, his reputation for hard work, and his\n\nreputation as a man who supports his family. The testimony of Collier's trial counsel in his habeas\n\ncorpus proceedings, as well as the affidavits of persons who either were interviewed by trial counsel\n\nbut not called to testify or who testified before the jury, demonstrates that counsel were aware of\n\nnumerous facts from Collier's personal, medical, and social history that would have led the jury to\n\nforego the death penalty.\n\n        In evaluating the probability that Collier's jury would have rejected the death penalty, we\n\nmust not forget to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors that would have been before the\n\njury in the absence of his counsels' errors. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. The\n\ndistrict court held that even if defense counsel were ineffective in every way alleged in Collier's\n\npetition, Collier would be unable to demonstrate prejudice because:\n\n        [t]he murder took place following an armed robbery; it involved a defendant who wrested\n        a police officer's gun from him, shot one officer, and then turned and killed the officer whose\n        gun he had taken; and the murder occurred in a rural community, where the murdered\n        officer was widely known.\n\nThe first two factors listed by the district court generally represent the aggravating circumstances\n\nof Collier's murder conviction: he killed a police officer while trying to prevent his arrest for the\n\ncommission of another felony. Although we do not underestimate the strength of these aggravating\n\nfactors, we believe that there is at least a reasonable probability that a jury confronted with the stark\n\ncontrast between Collier's acts on the day of the crimes and his history would not have voted for the\n\ndeath sentence. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390 (quoting Jackson v. Herring, 42 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th\n\nCir.1995), for the proposition that \"[m]any death penalty cases involve murders that are carefully\n\n                                                   37\n\fplanned, or accompanied by torture, rape, or kidnaping\"). Had counsel presented the wealth of\n\nmitigating evidence that they gathered in preparation for the sentencing phase of the trial, see supra\n\nnote 19, we believe there is a reasonable probability that consideration of these facts would have led\n\nthe jury to a different result. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390-91 (affirming grant of the writ in case\n\nwhere evidence of \"unfortunate upbringing\" was not investigated by counsel and not presented\n\nduring the sentencing phase of defendant's trial).\n\n        On the other hand, the third factor listed by the district court—that the murder occurred in\n\na rural community where the officer was widely known—seems to suggest that the people of the\n\ncommunity could not adequately put aside their anger about the crime to reach a detached and\n\ninformed sentencing decision based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case.\n\nAlthough taking into account the righteous anger of the jurors at the killing of a person well-known\n\nto them might have given the district court a more accurate idea of whether a 1978 Catoosa County\n\njury would have opted for a sentence of life imprisonment had they heard all of the mitigating\n\nevidence, such considerations run afoul of Strickland. \"The assessment of prejudice should proceed\n\non the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying\n\nthe standards that govern the decision.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068 (emphasis\n\nadded). We must therefore assume that the jurors could put aside their passions and render a\n\nsentence based upon the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case as presented to them.\n\nUnder such an assumption, we believe that the jury would have come to a different result.\n\n       In conclusion, we reiterate the Supreme Court's statement in Strickland that\n\n       the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose\n       result is being challenged. In every case the court should be concerned with whether, despite\n       the strong presumption of reliability, the result of the particular proceeding is unreliable\n\n\n                                                 38\n\f        because of a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just\n        results.\n\nId. at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. By failing to seek expert testimony regarding the effect of Collier's\n\ndiabetes upon his ability to control his behavior on the day of the crimes, and by failing to present\n\nevidence of Collier's background that would have mitigated his sentence, Collier's counsel\n\nprecipitated a \"breakdown in the adversarial process.\" The jury was called upon to determine\n\nwhether a man whom they did not know would live or die; they were not presented with the\n\nparticularized circumstances of his past and of his actions on the day of the crime that would have\n\nallowed them fairly to balance the seriousness of his transgressions with the conditions of his life.\n\nHad they been able to do so, we believe that it is at least reasonably probable that the jury would\n\nhave returned a sentence other than death.\n\n                                                  III.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Robert Lewis Collier did not receive the effective\n\nassistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution, at the sentencing phase of his trial. We therefore AFFIRM the district court's denial\n\nof Collier's petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his convictions, REVERSE the ruling\n\nof the district court denying Collier's petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his sentence\n\nof death, and REMAND this case, with the instruction that the district court grant the writ of habeas\n\ncorpus vacating Collier's sentence of death.\n\n        AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   39\n\f",

In 1978,\n\nCollier was convicted in the Superior Court of Catoosa County, Georgia, of felony murder,\n\naggravated assault, and three armed robberies. Collier was sentenced to death for the murder\n\nconviction. The murder occurred as Collier fled from the scene of three armed robberies; the victim\n\nwas a deputy sheriff. Collier's petition for habeas corpus relief presented a number of constitutional\n\nchallenges to both his convictions and his death sentence.

Alternatively, Collier argues that, in\n\nviolation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, his attorneys rendered\n\nineffective assistance of counsel in failing to present evidence of his background and character that\n\nlikely would have led the jury to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than of death. We\n\fconclude that Collier's counsel were ineffective, and therefore direct the district court to issue the\n\nwrit with respect to Collier's death sentence.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       On April 14, 1978, Collier left his home in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, and drove to Fort\n\nOglethorpe, Georgia, intending to commit a robbery. In Fort Oglethorpe, Collier parked his car\n\nbeside a fast food restaurant, placed a .32 caliber revolver in a grocery bag, and walked to a nearby\n\nfloral shop. After entering the shop, Collier drew the revolver and demanded money from the cash\n\nregister as well as from the four women present in the shop. Collier took the cash but allowed the\n\nwomen to keep their purses. After telling them to get down on the floor and put their hands behind\n\ntheir heads, Collier exited the store, walked to his car, placed the sack containing the money and the\n\ngun in the trunk, and began driving back toward South Pittsburgh.\n\n       The women in the store immediately called the police, and the Catoosa County Sheriff's\n\nDepartment was notified. Sheriff's Investigator George Brown responded to the call and began\n\ndriving to the floral shop. While en route, Brown passed Collier driving in the opposite direction.\n\nRecognizing Collier's car from the description he had received on his radio, Brown turned his car\n\naround, caught up with Collier, and activated his blue lights. Collier immediately stopped his car\n\nand got out. Collier began walking toward Brown's car with his wallet in his hand. Drawing his\n\ngun, Brown ordered Collier to \"spread eagle\" and to place his hands on his car. At approximately\n\nthe same time, Sheriff's Deputy Baxter Shavers arrived and approached Collier and Brown with his\n\ngun drawn. Seeing Shavers with his gun drawn, Brown holstered his own weapon and began to pat\n\nCollier down.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Shavers then walked up to Collier and, while pointing his gun at Collier, began to look into\n\nCollier's car. Collier grabbed the gun from Shavers, throwing Brown off of him in the process. As\n\nBrown attempted to draw his weapon again, Collier fired two shots at him, hitting him once in the\n\nhip and knocking him to the ground. Shavers had begun running toward his vehicle when Collier\n\nturned and fired shots at him. One shot hit Shavers in the neck, killing him instantly. Collier got\n\ninto his car and began to drive away. In the meantime, Brown, still on the ground, had drawn his\n\nweapon and fired six harmless shots into Collier's fleeing automobile. The shots failed to disable\n\nCollier or his vehicle.\n\n       Collier returned to South Pittsburgh, gathered his wife and their two sons, and drove to\n\nAlabama. The next day, however, Collier decided to return to South Pittsburgh. He was\n\napprehended by Tennessee law enforcement before he reached his home. Within one hour of his\n\narrest, Collier gave a statement to a Tennessee State Trooper that implicated him in the crimes.\n\nCollier then asked for, and received, permission to contact an attorney who previously had\n\nrepresented him. After the attorney arrived, Collier was placed in a lineup and identified as the\n\nperson who had robbed the floral shop and the four customers. Following this identification, Collier,\n\ncontrary to his attorney's advice, waived his right to remain silent and gave a complete confession.\n\n       Collier thereafter waived his right to an extradition hearing, and the Sheriff of Catossa\n\nCounty, Georgia, took him into custody. On his return to Georgia, Collier was indicted by a Catossa\n\nCounty grand jury for felony murder, aggravated assault for the shooting of Brown, and three counts\n\nof armed robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f       The guilt phase of Collier's trial began on Monday, September 25, 1978, and concluded on\n\nFriday, September 29, 1978, at 5:50 p.m.1 The jury found Collier guilty as charged. After the court\n\npolled the jury and published the verdicts, the judge announced that the sentencing phase of the trial\n\n(on the murder charge) would begin that evening, following a two-hour recess for dinner.2\n\n       The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. and concluded one hour and twenty-eight minutes\n\nlater, at 9:28 p.m., when the jury retired to deliberate. The jury returned its verdict, imposing the\n\ndeath penalty rather than life imprisonment, at 12:05 a.m. the next morning.3\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed Collier's convictions and sentences\n\nfor felony murder, aggravated assault, and two of the three armed robberies; the court reversed\n\nCollier's conviction for one of the armed robbery offenses because it had served as a lesser included\n\noffense of the felony murder.

On the \"reverse-Witherspoon \" claim, the court found that Collier's counsel\n\nattempted to question only two venire persons about their propensity to impose the death penalty\n\nand that in only one of those cases did the trial judge prevent counsel from inquiring; moreover,\n\ncounsel did not object to the court's ruling in either case. As for the change-of-venue issue, the\n\ndistrict court found that comprehensive questioning of the venire persons by the trial judge and\n\ncounsel revealed no bias against Collier and that the pretrial publicity was not \"so inflammatory and\n\nprejudicial as to warrant a change of venue.\"\n\n       Turning to Collier's claim that the death penalty was applied in a discriminatory manner in\n\nGeorgia, the district court ruled that the claim failed because Collier had not established that his\n\ndeath sentence was the result of discrimination by the decisionmakers in his case. Finally, with\n\nregard to Collier's claims of constitutional infirmity at the sentencing phase, the district court found\n\nthat Collier had neither shown that the trial judge improperly limited the scope of evidence that he\n\ncould present in mitigation nor demonstrated that his counsel were ineffective. The district court\n\nentered its judgment denying the writ on March 1, 1995. Collier thereafter filed a motion to alter\n\nthe judgment, which was denied on April 28, 1995. After the court granted Collier's application for\n\na certificate of probable cause to appeal, this appeal followed.6\n\n                                                  II.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    We have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994).\n\n                                                   7\n\f       Collier's brief on appeal raises essentially the same claims as those he presented to the\n\ndistrict court. The majority of his claims lack merit.7 We therefore reject them without comment,\n\nand limit our discussion to the claim that the sentencing phase of Collier's trial was constitutionally\n\ndeficient. The gravamen of this claim is that the jury was not presented with the wealth of available\n\nmitigating evidence that would have caused it to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than\n\na sentence of death. Collier contends that the jury did not receive this evidence for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the trial judge—in an off-the-record chambers conference shortly before the sentencing phase\n\nof the trial began—improperly limited the mitigation evidence defense counsel could present, in\n\nviolation of Lockett v.

In Lockett, the\n\nCourt was presented with the question of whether Ohio \"violated the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments by sentencing Sandra Lockett to death pursuant to a statute that narrowly limit[ed] the\n\n\n\n   7\n     These claims, which challenge Collier's convictions and/or his sentences, are: (1) that the\ntrial court improperly prohibited defense counsel from inquiring into whether the venire persons\nwould automatically impose the death penalty—Collier's \"reverse-Witherspoon \" claim; (2) that\nCollier's death sentence was the result of the racial bias of the decisionmakers; and (3) that the\ntrial court infringed on Collier's constitutional right of confrontation by admitting testimony of\nwitnesses who had been hypnotized. In addition to advancing these challenges to his convictions\nand sentences, Collier contends that we should vacate the district court's judgment and remand\nthe case for further proceedings because the district court erred in refusing to consider evidence\nof the racial bias of both the trial judge and his lead defense attorney. This claim is without\nmerit as well.\n\n                                                  8\n\fsentencer's discretion to consider the circumstances of the crime and the record and character of the\n\noffender as mitigating factors.\" Id. at 589, 98 S.Ct. at 2956-57 (footnote omitted). The Court found\n\nthat the \"qualitative difference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of\n\nreliability when the death sentence is imposed.\" Id. at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964. The Court concluded,\n\ntherefore, that \"the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, [must] not be precluded from\n\nconsidering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the\n\ncircumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\"\n\nId. at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964-65 (footnote omitted). Collier claims that after the guilt phase of his trial\n\nended and the sentencing phase began, the court limited the mitigating evidence that he could\n\npresent to the jury in violation of Lockett.\n\n                                                   1.\n\n        Collier initially raised this Lockett claim on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia,\n\ncontending that the trial judge, Judge Coker—during an off-the-record conference with counsel in\n\nchambers shortly before the sentencing phase of the trial was to begin—instructed defense counsel\n\nthat the only mitigating evidence they could introduce would be evidence of Collier's reputation in\n\nthe community for truth and veracity and evidence of specific acts tending to mitigate the homicide.\n\nAs evidence of this off-the-record conference, Collier's brief to the supreme court pointed to an\n\non-the-record-colloquy between the Judge Coker and Donald Bennett, Collier's lead trial counsel.\n\nThis conversation took place during the sentencing phase after Judge Coker, ruling on the State's\n\nobjection, refused to allow one of Collier's mitigation witnesses to testify that he and Collier had\n\n\"mutual respect\" for each other. In that colloquy, Judge Coker said:\n\n        Well, here we go again, you see, Mr. Bennett, evidently our little talk out there, the\n        bantering back and forth didn't mean very much to you, as to what you were going to do and\n\n                                                    9\n\f       I told you the problem that we get into by just doing these things, and evidently your memory\n       has become rather short. I know what you told me you were going to do, and I felt it might\n       be all right in a case like this.\n\n(emphasis added). Later in this exchange with Bennett, the judge again referred to a prior\n\ndiscussion, stating, \"Well now, Mr. Bennett, I don't want to get into a hassle with you over the thing,\n\nbecause I thought we had an understanding back there on the list of questions that you would submit\n\nto these witnesses.\" (emphasis added).\n\n       Despite the above references in the trial transcript, and the fact that Collier's counsel had\n\nbriefed the issue, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in its opinion disposing of Collier's appeal, limited\n\nits discussion to whether Judge Coker improperly excluded the testimony of the witness' \"mutual\n\nrespect\" for Collier. See Collier v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1263560\"><a href=\"/opinion/1263560/collier-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1263560\"><a href=\"/opinion/1263560/collier-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375-76 (Ga.1979). The\n\nsupreme court held that, although evidence that is inadmissible under the rules of evidence may be\n\nadmissible as mitigation, the witness' statement about his \"mutual respect\" for Collier was \"not\n\nhighly relevant\" and \"somewhat cumulative\"; therefore, Judge Coker had not abused his discretion\n\nin excluding it. Id. at 376.8\n\n       Collier raised his Lockett claim again in his first state habeas petition to the Butts County\n\nSuperior Court. The court held an evidentiary hearing on October 14, 1982, regarding the alleged\n\noff-the-record conversation between Judge Coker and the defense counsel. Jay Bennett, a member\n\nof Collier's defense team and son of Collier's lead trial counsel, Donald Bennett,9 represented Collier\n\n\n   8\n    The court also noted that defense counsel \"did not make any offer of proof of any specific\nacts of good conduct nor did he attempt to offer evidence of such acts. In fact, the one response\nof the witness now in question was the only evidence excluded by the trial court during the\nsentencing phase of appellant's trial.\" Id.\n   9\n     Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and the third member of Collier's defense team, James Secord,\nall participated in the prosecution of Collier's first and second federal habeas corpus petitions\n\n                                                  10\n\fat the evidentiary hearing and testified in place of his father as to the events of the trial. Jay Bennett\n\ntestified that, prior to the beginning of the sentencing phase, Judge Coker summoned him, his father,\n\nand the District Attorney, William Campbell, to the court's chambers for a conference about the\n\nevidence to be presented during the sentencing phase of the trial.10 Bennett stated that his father\n\ninformed Judge Coker that they had fourteen witnesses to present and that they intended to have the\n\nwitnesses testify about specific instances from Collier's past. According to Bennett, they told Judge\n\nCoker that these witnesses would testify to\n\n        [a] number of specific instances in Mr. Collier's life, rescuing an individual from drowning,\n        his career in school [in South Pittsburgh], instances where we felt he had proven and that he\n        had made positive contributions to the community. Facts not relating to the crime itself but\n        facts relating to Mr. Collier's personality, his background. Facts relating to his diabetes and\n        the effect of diabetes on his behavior, when his blood sugar level would be out of balance.\n        And testimony showing the history of his living in that South Pittsburgh community.\n\nJudge Coker refused to allow the proffered testimony, responding, as Bennett related,\n\n        in no uncertain terms that we could not go into any evidence relating to the individual except\n        for opinion testimony as to his reputation for truth and veracity. He said this is a criminal\n        trial. You are bound by the rules of evidence. You can introduce evidence relating to the\n        crime itself but no specific facts, no individual opinions, nothing from the accused's\n        background.\n\nOn cross-examination, Bennett testified that Judge Coker told defense counsel on two occasions that\n\nthe evidence they could present would be limited—first, when Judge Coker met them out on the\n\n\n\n\nand his first state habeas corpus petition. Jay Bennett was the only member of the defense team\nwho testified at the October 14, 1982, evidentiary hearing.\n   10\n     Assistant District Attorney Gillenn attended a portion of the chambers conference to present\nthe State's position on the admissibility of Collier's Florida conviction for manslaughter, which\nthe State wished to introduce at the sentencing phase of the trial. According to Gillenn,\nmitigation evidence was not a topic of discussion while he was present.\n\n                                                   11\n\fstreet as he was walking to dinner, and again in the judge's chambers shortly before the trial\n\nresumed. On the latter occasion, the District Attorney was present.\n\n          After testifying, Jay Bennett called William Campbell to the stand to testify as to his\n\nrecollection of the events in question. Contrary to Bennett's assertions, Campbell testified that Judge\n\nCoker told defense counsel that he would give them wide latitude to present mitigating evidence.\n\nCampbell stated that \"[t]here was no way the Court held them to the rigid rules of evidence as to the\n\ncharacter witness [sic], period.\" Campbell testified that the judge's chambers conference with\n\ncounsel prior to the sentencing phase mainly concerned whether the State could present evidence\n\nof Collier's prior manslaughter conviction in Florida; Judge Coker ruled against him and excluded\n\nthe evidence. Judge Coker also instructed Campbell to \"sit pretty solemn and quiet\" during\n\nsentencing.11 Campbell noted that whereas he proffered the evidence (the conviction) he intended\n\nto introduce during the sentencing phase, defense counsel made no proffer of the evidence they\n\nintended to present; in fact, they did not reveal what they intended to present until their witnesses\n\ntook the stand.\n\n          Because of health problems, Judge Coker did not appear at the evidentiary hearing. He was\n\nable to appear for deposition the day after the hearing,12 however; his deposition was made part of\n\nthe evidentiary hearing and considered by the court. Judge Coker's memory of the off-the-record\n\nconversations with counsel differed substantially from Jay Bennett's. Judge Coker recalled the\n\n\n\n   11\n    On direct examination, Campbell agreed that there were a number of off-the-record\nconferences between the court and counsel. Most of these conferences were between the court\nand defense counsel, who repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea agreement under which\nCollier would receive a life sentence.\n   12\n        At the deposition, Donald Bennett appeared for Collier and questioned Judge Coker.\n\n                                                  12\n\foff-the-record chambers conference he convened between the guilt and sentencing phases of the\n\ntrial, and said that he probably advised counsel that the presentation of evidence at the sentencing\n\nphase would be \"governed primarily by the rules of evidence.\" He was certain, however, that, after\n\nthe trial resumed, he permitted defense counsel to go beyond the rules of evidence and to introduce\n\nevidence of Collier's family life and work habits, as well as whether or not Collier paid his bills on\n\ntime. His recollection was that defense counsel proffered as mitigating evidence no specific acts\n\nfrom Collier's past, and that he placed no limitation on what counsel could ask their witnesses.\n\nJudge Coker said that he had no idea of the testimony defense counsel intended to elicit from their\n\nwitnesses; his bottom line was, \"ask the question and then let me rule on it.\"\n\n        Despite holding an evidentiary hearing and taking extensive testimony regarding the\n\nexistence and substance of the off-the-record conference between Judge Coker and counsel, the\n\nsuperior court's order disposing of Collier's habeas petition said remarkably little about his Lockett\n\nclaim. The order merely noted that \"[t]he Supreme Court has concluded that the trial court did not\n\nerr in excluding certain evidence offered in mitigation.\" As for the new evidence adduced at the\n\nevidentiary hearing, including Judge Coker's deposition, the court concluded that the evidence failed\n\nto establish a Lockett violation.\n\n        Collier appealed the court's decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. That court, noting that\n\nthe \"record of the trial fails to disclose any offer of proof which was made relating to the restrictions\n\nallegedly placed on counsel,\" affirmed the lower court's ruling that Collier had not carried his burden\n\nof proving that the trial court, in an off-the-record ruling, had limited the mitigating evidence the\n\ndefense could bring before the jury.

The first federal court ruling on the merits of Collier's Lockett claim\n\ntherefore occurred in the district court proceeding now under review. Based upon its examination\n\nof the record developed by the Butts County Superior Court in October 1982, the district court found\n\nthat the testimony of Collier's attorney, Jay Bennett, the prosecuting attorneys, Campbell and\n\nGillenn, and Judge Coker all were credible.13 Because there was a direct conflict between the\n\nversion of the off-the-record conferences offered by defense counsel and the version recalled by\n\nJudge Coker and the prosecutors, the court found the evidence to be \"equal as to what occurred\"—in\n\nessence that the evidence was in equipoise—and therefore ruled as a matter of law that Collier had\n\nnot carried his burden of establishing a Lockett violation.\n\n        In reviewing a district court's resolution of a Lockett claim, we accept the district court's\n\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, and we review the court's conclusions of law de\n\nnovo. Respondent contends, in his brief to this court, that the district court's conclusion that the\n\nevidence bearing on Collier's Lockett claim was \"in equipoise\" is a factual determination, and thus\n\nsubject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. We believe that there is only one way in which\n\nevidence of a historical fact may be in equipoise. When a trial court is presented with circumstantial\n\nevidence that yields equal, opposing inferences, the evidence as to the inferential facts is in\n\n\n\n   13\n     At an evidentiary hearing held on January 27-28, 1994, the district court heard the testimony\nof two of Collier's trial attorneys, Jay Bennett—who had testified in the state habeas corpus\nproceeding in the Butts County Superior Court—and James Secord. The court disregarded their\ntestimony, however, choosing instead to rely on the cold record of the state proceeding. The\ndistrict court disregarded Bennett's and Secord's testimony because their testimony did not add to\nthe evidence developed in the state proceeding.\n\n                                                 14\n\fequipoise—neither inference is more likely to be true than the other. We are not presented with that\n\nsituation here. Instead, we are presented with a swearing match. One of Collier's trial attorneys\n\npresents one version of the off-the-record conferences that took place before the sentencing phase\n\nof the trial commenced; Judge Coker and the prosecutors present another. By finding that the\n\nversions presented by both sides of the dispute were \"credible,\" and that the evidence as to what\n\ntranspired at the conference was therefore in equipoise, the district court made no factual\n\ndetermination at all. The evidence offered by both sides constituted direct, not circumstantial,\n\nevidence, and a fact finding required a choice between the two contradictory versions of events.\n\nBecause the district court did not make such a choice, its determination that the evidence is \"in\n\nequipoise\" is entitled to no deference.14\n\n        Ordinarily, we would remand the case to the district court and instruct it to make a credibility\n\nchoice and resolve the dispute. Because in our view only one credibility choice is reasonable given\n\nthe record this case presents, however, we forego a remand and proceed to decide both the Lockett\n\nissue and Collier's claim that his attorney's performance failed to pass constitutional muster.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n        We first note that it is difficult to believe, as Jay Bennett asserted in his testimony before\n\nthe Butts County Superior Court, that Judge Coker would have prohibited Collier's attorneys from\n\npresenting any evidence of character other than Collier's reputation in the community for truth and\n\nveracity. Collier did not testify in either the guilt phase or the sentencing phase of the trial; thus,\n\n\n\n   14\n     In effect, the district court fashioned the following rule to deny Collier relief on his claim:\nif the court (in a bench trial) could reasonably believe the testimony offered by both sides of an\nissue, the court need not decide which testimony is true—because the evidence is in\nequipoise—and the party with the burden of proof loses.\n\n                                                  15\n\fhis reputation for truth and veracity was entirely irrelevant.15 Such a limitation by the trial judge\n\nwould not simply have violated Lockett, it would have been absurd. Nevertheless, given the\n\nconflicting accounts provided by Jay Bennett on the one hand, and Judge Coker, Campbell, and\n\nGillenn on the other, we look to the transcript of the sentencing phase of the trial for evidence that\n\nmight shed light on what Judge Coker actually said to defense counsel off the record.\n\n        Collier contends that statements made by Judge Coker on the record following the\n\nprosecutor's objection to the testimony of his third witness, Shelly Jordan—that he had \"mutual\n\nrespect\" for Collier—support his claim that the judge improperly limited the mitigation evidence his\n\nattorneys could present. The transcript reveals that Collier's counsel began the sentencing phase by\n\nasking the first two witnesses a few brief questions about their personal history and association with\n\nCollier, and then about Collier's reputation in the community for truth and veracity, whether the\n\nwitness would believe Mr. Collier under oath, and little else.16 The third witness called to the stand\n\nwas Shelly Jordan. Donald Bennett began the direct examination of the witness by asking\n\nfoundational questions, apparently as a predicate to inquiring about Collier's reputation. The\n\nfollowing transpired:\n\n        MR. BENNETT: What has been your association with Mr. Collier?\n\n\n\n\n   15\n    The indictment in this case did not charge Collier with perjury or some other false statement\noffense as to which his reputation for truth and veracity would be relevant. The only statement\nmade by Collier that was before the jury was his confession to the crimes of murder, aggravated\nassault, and armed robbery. By presenting evidence of Collier's reputation for truth and veracity,\nCollier's attorneys actually buttressed his confession that he committed those crimes.\n   16\n     Donald Bennett did ask the first two witnesses whether they considered Collier's character,\ngenerally, to be \"good\" or \"bad,\" in addition to the questions about his reputation for\ntruthfulness.\n\n                                                 16\n\f       MR. JORDAN: Well, we were always close friends, and always got along well, and had a\n             lot of mutual respect for each other.\n\n       MR. BENNETT: Do you have that respect for him now?\n\n       MR. CAMPBELL: Your Honor, I object at this time, it's not what he thinks of him.\n\n       THE COURT: I believe you've gone a little far afield, as to his feeling for the defendant.\n\n       MR. CAMPBELL: It's whether he knows him in the community where he lives, and not\n            what he thinks about him, but what the people in that community, it's not what he\n            thinks, it's what the people in the community think.\n\n       THE COURT: I think you should be a little more limited in your examination of the\n            witnesses relative to anything in mitigation.\n\n       MR. BENNETT: Is it Your Honor's ruling that I cannot ask him his personal opinion as to\n            what he thinks of this defendant?\n\n       THE COURT: His reputation in the community.\n\n(emphasis added). In the ensuing conversation, which took place outside the presence of the jury\n\nbut on the record, Judge Coker acknowledged that there had been some discussion with counsel\n\nprior to the sentencing phase about the evidence the defense could offer. In contrast to Jay Bennett's\n\ntestimony (at the habeas hearing before the Butts County Superior Court) that Judge Coker told\n\nCollier's counsel what evidence they could present, however, Judge Coker said, \"I know what you\n\ntold me you were going to do, and I felt it might be all right in a case like this.\" Moreover, Judge\n\nCoker's statements on the record belie Bennett's statement that Judge Coker restricted the testimony\n\nto Collier's reputation in the community for truth and veracity and evidence in mitigation of the\n\ncrime itself. Judge Coker said:\n\n       I told you that these things that [are] admissible, it's about his reputation in the community\n       for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things like that, I think that\n       would be mitigating, but because you might have a mutual admiration for him, that is not a\n       mitigating circumstance, and I am going to rule that personal thoughts of him, whether\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f       they're good friends or buddies, it doesn't really have any bearing on the issues, that's what\n       I'm trying to say.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       As is apparent from this statement, Judge Coker felt that the testimony regarding the witness'\n\n\"mutual respect\" for Collier was not mitigating evidence. He repeatedly inquired of Donald Bennett\n\nas to how the evidence was mitigating, stating several times that he, personally, did not think that\n\nthe evidence was relevant. In addition, Judge Coker asked how the proffered testimony was in\n\n\"mitigation or extenuation of punishment,\" not of the crime itself. Although there are indications\n\nin the sentencing phase transcript that Judge Coker felt that he was generally bound by the rules of\n\nevidence (in fact, he admitted as much during his deposition in the state habeas proceeding), there\n\nare ample indications that Judge Coker was willing to accept evidence that would not be admissible\n\nunder a strict application of the rules of evidence.\n\n       Finally, we note that Donald Bennett asked Judge Coker whether he could ask other\n\nwitnesses the question he had put to Shelly Jordan without being \"criticized\" by the court. Judge\n\nCoker, as he testified was his practice, responded: \"I think you'll need to ask the question before I\n\nmake a determination as to whether it's in mitigation or not, whether it complies with the rules of\n\nevidence.\" Bennett did not ask the question again, nor did he make a proffer of any testimony he\n\nthought Judge Coker had excluded during the off-the-record chambers conference held before the\n\nsentencing phase commenced. This is not a surprising result, given that Judge Coker did not limit\n\nor exclude any of the mitigation evidence, other than Shelly Jordan's statement that he had \"mutual\n\nrespect\" for Collier, that the defense team endeavored to bring before the jury. If Judge Coker had\n\nlimited the presentation of mitigating evidence in the way Bennett claims, he likely would have\n\nexcluded other evidence offered by the defense during the sentencing phase; that he did not exclude\n\n                                                 18\n\fother evidence during the sentencing phase suggests that no such limitations were placed on the\n\ndefense during the pre-sentencing phase conference.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n       We conclude that the record does not support Collier's claim that the trial court improperly\n\nlimited the scope of the evidence the defense team could offer in mitigation during the sentencing\n\nphase of the trial. Although the record suggests that defense counsel may have been confused about\n\nthe extent of the testimony the court would allow them to elicit from their witnesses, and that the\n\ncourt may have had a more narrow view than Lockett embraced concerning the sort of evidence that\n\ncould appropriately be admitted during the sentencing phase of a capital case, the evidence does not\n\nsupport Jay Bennett's position that Judge Coker told the defense team that all he would allow would\n\nbe testimony of Collier's reputation in the community for truth and veracity and evidence of acts\n\nmitigating the crime itself. As noted above, the only evidence Judge Coker excluded was Shelly\n\nJordan's statement that he had \"mutual respect\" for Collier—testimony which, although largely\n\nirrelevant, arguably should have been admitted given the broad latitude accorded to capital\n\ndefendants to present mitigation evidence. Furthermore, Judge Coker's on-the-record statements as\n\nto the evidence that, in his view, would constitute mitigating evidence seriously undermines Jay\n\nBennett's claim that the only evidence that could be introduced was testimony of Collier's reputation\n\nfor truth and veracity and evidence in mitigation of the crime itself. Collier's Lockett claim\n\naccordingly fails.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        Collier claims, alternatively, that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. First, Collier contends that his attorneys were\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fineffective because their investigation in preparation for the sentencing phase was deficient; they\n\nfailed to interview and present testimony from numerous close personal friends and relatives who\n\ncould have provided persuasive mitigating evidence, and they failed to explore and present readily\n\navailable expert opinion evidence regarding his diabetes and diffuse organic brain damage. Second,\n\nCollier contends that counsels' actual presentation at the sentencing phase of trial was ineffective\n\nin that they failed to elicit, from the witnesses who did testify, anecdotal evidence regarding his\n\npersonal history, diabetic condition, and specific circumstances bearing on the robberies and murder\n\nthat would have effectively foreclosed the death sentence. Collier contends that his attorneys also\n\nwere ineffective because they failed to object on the record to the court's perceived (by them)\n\nlimitation of mitigation evidence and failed to make an offer of proof as to what his witnesses would\n\nhave said had they been permitted to testify.17\n\n                                                   1.\n\n        The first time Collier alleged that his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nduring the sentencing phase was in his first state habeas petition. At that time, Collier was still being\n\nrepresented by his defense team. Not surprisingly, then, the claim was not premised upon volitional\n\n\n   17\n     In a residual clause in his brief encompassing all of the claims that he presented to the\ndistrict court but, due to space limitation, he was unable to include in his brief, Collier\nincorporated several other grounds for his ineffective assistance claim. To the extent those\ngrounds relate to counsels' alleged ineffectiveness during the guilt phase of the trial, we believe\nthat the district court properly disposed of them. Our finding that Collier has not demonstrated\nthat his counsel were ineffective in the guilt phase does not affect our examination of their\nperformance in the sentencing phase. We evaluate the attorneys' performances during each\n\"discreet portion[ ] of a trial without regard to the attorney[s'] performance[s] at other points\nduring the trial.\" Horton v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566779\"><a href=\"/opinion/566779/jimmy-lee-horton-v-walter-zant-warden-georgia-diagnostic-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1461 (11th Cir.1991).\n\n               With respect to the additional examples of ineffective assistance in the sentencing\n        phase that Collier presented in this \"catch-all\" residual clause, we need not consider them\n        given our holding that counsel were ineffective in the sentencing phase.\n\n                                                   20\n\fineffectiveness of trial counsel, but rather upon the same allegations that underpinned his Lockett\n\nclaim—that Judge Coker rendered counsel ineffective when he precluded counsel in an\n\noff-the-record ruling from presenting any substantial mitigating evidence. As it did with Collier's\n\nLockett claim, the state habeas court concluded that Collier had not carried his burden of proof on\n\nthis ineffective assistance claim. Collier, still represented by his defense team, see supra note 9,\n\npresented the same claim in his second federal habeas petition, but the petition was dismissed\n\nbecause Collier had not exhausted his state remedies with respect to all of his claims.\n\n        Collier parted ways with his defense team before filing his second state habeas petition, thus\n\npaving the way for new counsel to claim that Collier's defense counsel rendered ineffective\n\nassistance in the sentencing phase of his trial. The petition alleged that counsel were ineffective for\n\nfailing to present \"mitigating evidence that would have convinced the jury that Petitioner was not\n\n\"some huge, black man,' as the prosecuting attorney frequently referred to Petitioner, with an evil\n\nand malicious heart that deserved to die.\" According to the petition, a wealth of evidence was\n\navailable to demonstrate that Collier was a good family man, an upstanding public citizen willing\n\nto risk his own injury to help others, and that he was a diabetic who had trouble controlling his\n\nbehavior when he was not properly medicated. The state habeas court concluded that the doctrine\n\nof res judicata precluded it from considering Collier's claim since the claim had been raised in his\n\nfirst state habeas petition. The court concluded, alternatively, that Collier had waived any claim of\n\nineffective assistance that he had not raised in his first state habeas petition.\n\n        In Collier's third federal habeas petition, he raised both claims of ineffective assistance: (1)\n\nthat the trial court's off-the-record-evidentiary ruling had rendered counsel ineffective; and (2) that\n\ncounsel were independently ineffective for not objecting on the record to that ruling and for failing\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fto present efficacious mitigating evidence. The district court dismissed the petition without\n\nprejudice because Collier had not exhausted all of his state law claims. In his third and last state\n\nhabeas petition, Collier again alleged that his attorneys' performance was ineffective, calling the\n\ncourt's attention to two aspects of counsels' performance that were deficient. The court found that\n\nboth had been raised—albeit in different forms—in earlier state petitions and disposed of, and that\n\nthe earlier dispositions were res judicata.\n\n       Returning to federal court, Collier once again raised his claim of ineffective assistance in his\n\nfourth habeas petition—the petition under review.           The respondent contends that Collier\n\nprocedurally defaulted his claim because he did not assert it until his second state habeas petition.\n\nThe district court agreed with respondent and applied the \"cause and prejudice\" test to determine\n\nwhether Collier's failure to follow the applicable state procedural rules precluded his claim.

The test for whether counsel has provided\n\nthe effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments was\n\narticulated by the Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under Strickland, a person asserting a claim of ineffective assistance must\n\nsatisfy a two prong test:\n\n        First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires\n        showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n        \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must\n        show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that\n        counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result\n        is reliable.\n\nId. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. In a capital case, this two part test applies to claims of ineffective\n\nassistance during the sentencing phase as well as the guilt phase of the trial, because a \"capital\n\nsentencing proceeding ... is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of\n\nstandards for decision ... that counsel's role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel's role at\n\ntrial—to ensure that the adversarial testing process works to produce a just result under the standards\n\ngoverning decision.\" Id. at 686-87, 104 S.Ct. at 2064 (citations omitted).\n\n        In subpart i, we examine Collier's claims of ineffective assistance to determine whether he\n\nhas satisfied the performance prong of the Strickland test. In subpart ii, we determine whether\n\nCollier has demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced by the acts and omissions of his attorneys.\n\n                                                    i.\n\n        In order to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel were ineffective, Collier\n\nmust demonstrate that their \"representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Id.\n\nat 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The performance inquiry thus seeks to determine whether, under\n\n                                                   24\n\f\"prevailing professional norms,\" counsel's \"assistance was reasonable considering all the\n\ncircumstances.\" Id., 104 S.Ct. at 2065. In evaluating Collier's ineffective assistance claim, we must\n\ngive great deference to counsels' choice of strategy and execution. Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065\n\n(discussing the danger of hindsight in such an evaluation and noting that the defendant must\n\novercome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \"might be considered\n\nsound trial strategy\") (quoting Michel v.

With these principles in mind, we first examine counsels' investigation in preparation\n\nfor the sentencing phase, and then their presentation of mitigating evidence before the jury.\n\n                                                   a.\n\n       Collier raises two distinct claims of ineffective assistance based on his counsels' failure to\n\ninvestigate more fully his personal history as well as his medical and mental condition at the time\n\nof the crimes. First, he contends that his attorneys failed to interview close relatives and friends who\n\ncould have provided an abundance of information regarding his childhood, economic circumstances\n\nsurrounding his upbringing, social environment in his hometown, diabetic condition as well as\n\nattendant physical and emotional problems, and specific events in his life that would have mitigated\n\nthe sentence imposed by the jury. Second, Collier claims that his attorneys failed to pursue expert\n\nopinion testimony relating to his diabetes and to \"diffuse organic brain damage.\" According to\n\nCollier, such testimony should have been proffered during the sentencing phase to show his reduced\n\ncapacity to conform his behavior to the law, even if such testimony could not support a legal defense\n\nto the crimes themselves.\n\n        With regard to Collier's first claim—that counsel failed to interview a number of close\n\nrelatives and friends of Collier that could have provided additional evidence to be used in the\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fsentencing phase of his trial—the district court found that counsels' failure to pursue those witnesses'\n\ntestimony was the direct result of a conscious tactical decision. \"The question of whether a decision\n\nby counsel was a tactical one is a question of fact.\" Bolender, 16 F.3d at 1558 n. 12 (citing Horton,\n\n941 F.2d at 1462). Whether the tactic was reasonable, however, is a question of law and is reviewed\n\nde novo. See Horton, 941 F.2d at 1462. In assessing the reasonableness of the tactic, we consider\n\n\"all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments.\" Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.\n\n        Jay Bennett testified that the defense team thought that if they \"could bring out just exactly\n\nwhat the so-called better class of the community over in Jasper and South Pittsburgh thought about\n\n[Collier], well, that surely the jury would give some consideration to that.\" Collier's lead defense\n\nattorney, Donald Bennett, was from the largely rural area in which the trial was held, and was\n\nfamiliar with the attitudes of the local citizenry. He was well-positioned, therefore, to determine\n\nwhat testimony would be most well-received by the jury. Bennett believed that the jury would be\n\nable to relate to witnesses representing the \"governing part of the city.\" In addition, counsel thought\n\nthey were limited in the number of witnesses they could present; the out-of-state witnesses from\n\nCollier's hometown in Tennessee had to be subpoenaed, court orders for their appearance had to be\n\nobtained, and witness fees had to be tendered. Donald Bennett traveled to South Pittsburgh and\n\nJasper and interviewed quite a few potential witnesses, including Collier's wife. From those he\n\nselected fourteen to subpoena for trial, ten of whom were called to testify. They included Collier's\n\nwife, a lifelong friend, people from South Pittsburgh for or with whom Collier had worked and had\n\nknown for twenty years or more, the principal of Collier's high school, a member of the South\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fPittsburgh City Commission, and a friend of Collier's father's who had known Collier since he was\n\na child.\n\n           As the district court noted, the witnesses whom counsel selected to testify possessed much\n\nof the information about Collier's past and character that Collier now contends should have been\n\npresented to the jury.19 Although we might think that it would have been more prudent for Collier's\n\nattorneys to investigate other possible avenues for obtaining information about Collier's character\n\nand background, including Collier's relatives and close friends, \"in considering claims of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, \"[w]e address not what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is\n\nconstitutionally compelled.' \" Burger v.

Considering all of the circumstances from the position of Collier's counsel\n\nat the time of their conduct, see Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, we cannot conclude\n\n\n\n\n   19\n     The witnesses whom counsel called to the stand could have testified that Collier's mother\ndied when he was an infant, and that while his father left him in the care of his aunt and uncle to\nraise, he kept Collier's older brother, and later remarried and had three more children. They\ncould have testified about Collier's upbringing as a poor black child in a segregated southern\ntown and about his gentle disposition despite his large stature; that Collier worked from an early\nage to help support himself and his aunt and uncle; that he persevered in school despite being a\nslow learner, becoming a football star in high school and then seeing his career end due to an\ninjury during his senior year; and that he moved to Seattle after a stint in the army, and then\nreturned to South Pittsburgh to take care of the aunt who had raised him while she was dying of\ncancer. The witnesses could have testified that Collier started a family upon his return to South\nPittsburgh; that he was a devoted father and husband; that he worked hard to provide for his\nfamily; and that, about a month before he committed the crimes in this case, he lost his job with\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority and was nearly out of money when he committed them. At least\none witness, in addition to Collier's wife, could have testified about Collier's heroic attempt to\nsave the life of a motorist trapped in a car that had veered off a bridge into a creek. Finally,\nseveral witnesses, and especially Collier's wife, could have testified that Collier was diabetic and\nthat he was moody and irrational when he had either not taken his insulin or missed a meal.\n\n                                                  27\n\fthat counsel were ineffective for failing to interview additional potential witnesses in preparation\n\nfor the sentencing phase.\n\n        Collier's second contention is that counsel were ineffective for not pursuing expert opinions\n\non the effects of diabetes and \"diffuse organic brain damage\" upon Collier's ability to control his\n\nbehavior. These omissions are not premised upon any tactical choice of defense counsel. We\n\ntherefore review the record to determine whether counsels' failure to obtain expert opinions fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness, taking into consideration all the circumstances at the\n\ntime.\n\n        We find it easy to dispose of Collier's argument that his attorneys should have obtained\n\nexpert opinion testimony as to whether Collier was suffering from \"diffuse organic brain damage\"\n\nwhen the offenses occurred and whether any such brain damage would have affected his ability to\n\ncontrol his behavior. To support his claim in the district court, Collier presented the testimony of\n\na neuropsychologist, Dr. Joyce Carbonell, in which she stated that he suffered from \"diffuse organic\n\nbrain damage.\" Although counsel were aware before and during the trial that Collier was a \"slow\n\nlearner,\" and had difficulty reading and writing, they also knew that he had graduated from high\n\nschool, held steady employment, and raised a family. In addition, Collier's expert on diabetes, Dr.\n\nBuris Boshell, testified that he did not see any clear evidence of brain damage, and that during the\n\ninterview Collier was \"lucid and well-oriented.\" We agree with the district court's conclusion that\n\n\"there is nothing in the record to show how [knowledge that Collier was a slow learner] would have\n\nled a reasonable attorney in 1978 to believe that Collier was suffering from any kind of brain\n\ndamage.\" We therefore find that it was not unreasonable for counsel to fail to investigate the\n\npotential influence of \"diffuse organic brain damage\" upon Collier's behavior.\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f        Collier also contends that counsel were ineffective in their investigation for failing to obtain\n\nthe services of a diabetes expert to examine Collier and testify in the sentencing phase of the trial.\n\nIn Dr. Buris Boshell's opinion, Collier was suffering from acute hypoglycemia when he committed\n\nthe crimes in this case. The district court nevertheless held that counsel were not ineffective for\n\nfailing to obtain and present such opinion testimony. In making this determination, the court did not\n\napply the performance prong of the test from Strickland. Instead, finding it dispositive, the court\n\napplied the prejudice prong of the test as we had applied it in Elledge v. Dugger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491574\"><a href=\"/opinion/491574/william-duane-elledge-v-richard-l-dugger/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1445-48 (11th Cir.1987) (assessing a claim that counsel failed to procure an expert witness) and held\n\nthat Collier had not in fact been prejudiced.20 We conclude that Collier has demonstrated that\n\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to obtain an expert on diabetes. Evaluating counsels' omission\n\nin light of all the circumstances, competent counsel would have pursued an expert opinion on the\n\nrole that Collier's diabetes may have played in the criminal activity.\n\n        Our holding that counsel should have sought the opinion of an expert on diabetes is premised\n\nupon a number of established facts. First, counsel were aware that Collier's behavior was entirely\n\nout of character for a man who was universally described as gentle, respectful, and hardworking by\n\nthose who knew him. Second, Jay Bennett testified that the defense team was aware of Collier's\n\ndiabetes. Third, James Secord testified that not only did the defense team know that Collier had\n\ndiabetes, they intended to present evidence to the jury that Collier either was not receiving the\n\ncorrect dosage of insulin or had not had his insulin shot on the day of the crimes. As Secord stated,\n\n\"this might possibly have been a factor that would have altered his motivation or altered his\n\n\n   20\n     We disagree with the district court's finding that Collier was not prejudiced by counsels'\nfailure to obtain an expert witness to evaluate Collier and testify in the sentencing phase, but we\nreserve our discussion of prejudice for subpart ii of this opinion.\n\n                                                  29\n\fperception at the time and I remember that being to me an important aspect to get before the jury.\"\n\nFinally, counsel had very little evidence that mitigated the crime itself; evidence of Collier's\n\ndiabetes, and the affects upon his behavior of a chemical imbalance caused by improper medication,\n\nlikely would have constituted his strongest evidence mitigating the crimes Collier committed in this\n\ncase. We are mindful of the need to avoid evaluating the performance of counsel with the benefit\n\nof hindsight, but even in 1978 reasonable counsel would at least have sought an expert's opinion on\n\nthis issue. Counsel were thus ineffective for failing to pursue an expert on diabetes to examine\n\nCollier and testify at the sentencing phase.\n\n                                                  b.\n\n        We next evaluate counsels' performance during the actual sentencing phase of the trial. Jay\n\nBennett testified that the defense team \"knew from the start that the whole case was going to ride\n\non the sentencing phase.\" The team's conclusion is not surprising considering that Collier had been\n\ntied clearly to the crimes by eyewitness accounts, had given a full confession to authorities, and\n\nseemed to be of reasonable mental health. In fact, counsel considered having Collier plead guilty\n\nand then proceeding directly to the sentencing phase; William Campbell testified that Collier's\n\ndefense team repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea of guilty in exchange for a life sentence.\n\nIn short, Collier's attorneys intended to focus their efforts on presenting evidence that would mitigate\n\nCollier's sentence.\n\n       Counsels' intention of presenting a strong case in mitigation stands in stark contrast to the\n\npresentation that actually took place. After briefly summarizing the testimony that counsel adduced\n\nfrom Collier's ten mitigation witnesses, we then analyze whether counsels' performance fell below\n\nthe objective standard of reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. As noted supra, Collier\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fbased his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on two alternative theories: (1) that his\n\nattorneys' conduct was constitutionally deficient, or (2) that counsels' performance was rendered\n\nineffective by Judge Coker's ruling limiting the mitigating evidence counsel could present. The\n\nsecond theory, the Lockett claim, fails for the reasons stated in subpart A, supra. As for Collier's\n\nfirst theory, we conclude that counsels' performance did not comport with the standards of the\n\nprofession and was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances; hence, the performance\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n        The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night.21 The defense team called ten\n\nwitnesses to the stand. Despite their acknowledgment that the sentencing phase was the most\n\nimportant part of the trial, their examination of the witnesses was minimal. Counsel sought to elicit\n\nvery little relevant evidence about Collier's character. In fact, with respect to a number of witnesses,\n\ncounsel sought only their opinion of Collier's reputation for truth and veracity—a matter wholly\n\nirrelevant to the issue before the jury.22 Furthermore, even when counsel departed from the\n\n\n   21\n     The District Attorney, William Campbell, testified in the habeas hearing in the Butts County\nSuperior Court that neither party objected to beginning the sentencing phase at that hour,\nalthough both he and Donald Bennett were tired. They did not object because the two men\nstruck a deal; Campbell's assistant, Craig Gillenn, would make the State's closing argument to\nthe jury, and Bennett's assistant, James Secord, would present Collier's argument.\n   22\n     We note that Judge Coker actually prompted Donald Bennett to ask other questions of\nCollier's witnesses; the judge reminded Bennett of his earlier advice—that Collier's reputation\n\"for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things like that\" would be\nrelevant mitigating evidence. Despite Judge Coker's prompting, and his admonition at the\nconclusion of the colloquy over witness Shelly Jordan's \"mutual respect\" testimony, that Bennett\nwould need to ask questions before the court could rule on the admissibility of the testimony\nsuch questions would elicit, Bennett's direct examination of subsequent defense witnesses failed\nto explore in any significant way the witnesses' knowledge of Collier. Bennett raced through the\nremaining witnesses, eliciting very little in the way of mitigating evidence from any of them, and\nnot once making a proffer of additional evidence in response to what he perceived to be an\nadverse exclusionary ruling by the court.\n\n                                                  31\n\ftruth-and-veracity line of questioning, the testimony elicited was of a nature that could not\n\nreasonably have aided the jury in its sentence determination.\n\n        For instance, Collier's eighth witness was his wife, Mary Collier. After establishing that\n\nCollier and Mary had been married five years and had two children, both boys, ages three and five,\n\nthe remainder of her direct examination consisted of the following:\n\n        MR. BENNETT: And since you have been married, has Robert supported his family?\n\n        MRS. COLLIER: Yes, he has.\n\n        MR. BENNETT: Has he been a hard worker?\n\n        MRS. COLLIER: Yes, sir.\n\n        MR. BENNETT: I believe that's all I need to ask her.\n\nOn cross-examination, the prosecution had Mary Collier testify that she received $70 from Collier\n\non the day of the crimes, money that she now knew he had stolen from the floral shop. On re-direct\n\nexamination, Donald Bennett established that she was not aware of the crimes when she accepted\n\nthe money.\n\n        Counsel elicited little more mitigation testimony of substance from the other nine witnesses\n\ncalled on Collier's behalf. After the presentation of mitigating evidence ended, the court declared\n\na brief recess. Following the recess, counsel delivered their closing arguments, and the court\n\ncharged the jury. The jury retired to deliberate at 9:28 p.m. At 12:05 a.m. the next morning, the jury\n\nreturned its verdict.\n\n        In analyzing this claim of ineffective counsel, we note that defense counsel did elicit\n\ntestimony that Collier had a \"good\" reputation, that he was generally known as a hard worker who\n\ntook care of his family, and that he had a good reputation for truth and veracity. The trial transcript,\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fhowever, does not support the proposition that counsels' performance met the standard of objective\n\nreasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. Counsel presented no more than a hollow shell\n\nof the testimony necessary for a \"particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character\n\nand record of [a] convicted defendant before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death.\"\n\nWoodson v.

Instead of developing an image of Collier\n\nas a human being who was generally a good family man and a good public citizen, who had a\n\nbackground of poverty but who had worked hard as a child and as an adult to support his family and\n\nclose relatives, counsels' presentation tended to give the impression that the witnesses knew little\n\nor nothing about Collier. In failing to present any of the available evidence of Collier's upbringing,\n\nhis gentle disposition, his record of helping family in times of need, specific instances of his heroism\n\nand compassion, and evidence of his circumstances at the time of the crimes—including his recent\n\nloss of his job, his poverty, and his diabetic condition—counsels' performance brought into question\n\nthe reliability of the jury's determination that death was the appropriate sentence. See Woodson, 428\n\nU.S. at 305, 96 S.Ct. at 2991 (noting the qualitative difference in the need for reliability in a jury's\n\ndetermination that death is appropriate in a capital case).\n\n       Although Collier's attorneys concede that their performance was deficient, they blame the\n\ntrial judge rather than themselves for their poor display. We find that the trial judge was not to\n\nblame for counsels' ineffectiveness; rather, they were. In sum, counsel did not perform as\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fobjectively reasonable attorneys would have; their performance fell below the standards of the\n\nprofession and therefore their assistance at the sentencing phase of the trial was ineffective.\n\n                                                  ii.\n\n         Being satisfied that Collier has demonstrated that his attorneys' performance at the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial fell below the standard or reasonableness required by the Sixth\n\nAmendment, we must now determine whether counsels' inadequate performance during the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial prejudiced Collier. The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he purpose\n\nof the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance\n\nnecessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691-92, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 2067. To satisfy the prejudice prong of the analysis, therefore, \"[t]he defendant must show\n\nthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.\n\n        In this circuit, in order to prove that he has been prejudiced by counsel's failure to obtain\n\nexpert opinion testimony, a defendant must show not only that there is a reasonable probability that\n\nan impartial decisionmaker presented with the expert's testimony would reach a different conclusion,\n\nbut also \"what kind of, and how much, investigation an ordinary, reasonable lawyer would have\n\nundertaken ... [and] that it is reasonably probable that a reasonable investigation would have turned\n\nup an expert who would have presented testimony similar to that adduced.\" Elledge, 823 F.2d at\n\n1446 n. 15. Dr. Boshell testified that a local physician in 1978 would probably not have recognized\n\na possible relationship between Collier's actions on the day of the crimes and a potential episode of\n\nhypoglycemia brought on by Collier's not eating on that day in combination with his excessive\n\n\n                                                  34\n\finsulin dosage. Relying on this testimony, the district court held that it would have been reasonable\n\nfor an attorney in 1978 to forego seeking an expert on diabetes. The court found that Collier had\n\nnot \"shown that a reasonable attorney in 1978 would have investigated beyond asking local\n\nphysicians about diabetes and its possible effect on a person,\" and those physicians were unlikely\n\nto recognize the need for a specialist.\n\n        We disagree with the district court's conclusion that Collier has not demonstrated that he was\n\nprejudiced by counsels' failure to seek out an expert in diabetes. Dr. Boshell testified that either an\n\nendocrinologist, a specialist who studies diseases—like diabetes—that result from abnormalities in\n\nthe endocrine glands, or a neurologist could have made the connection between Collier's medical\n\ncondition and his actions on the day of the crimes. Although a general practitioner might not have\n\nrecognized the connection between diabetes and Collier's behavior, nor the excessive size of his\n\ninsulin dosage, a general practitioner is not an expert on diabetes. We see no reason why Collier's\n\ncounsel could not have obtained the name and phone number of an endocrinologist from either the\n\nphone book or from another physician and have had that specialist both examine Collier and provide\n\ntestimony at the sentencing phase of his trial.23 Dr. Boshell testified that the school of thought upon\n\nwhich he based his opinions had been popular since the 1950s, and therefore, experts sharing his\n\nopinions were not difficult to locate at the time of Collier's trial. Dr. Boshell himself, who practiced\n\nand taught medicine at the University of Alabama, would have been available and would have\n\ntestified the same way in 1978. Given that at least one member of Collier's defense team testified\n\nthat they intended to present non-expert evidence of Collier's diabetes and its possible effect on his\n\n\n   23\n     We imagine that a competent local physician, when questioned about a medical condition\nwith which he or she was unfamiliar, would refer the questioner to a specialist with competence\nin that area.\n\n                                                  35\n\fbehavior, we find that it was unreasonable for Collier's counsel to fail to contact an endocrinologist\n\nwho could have testified about the effect of diabetes on Collier's behavior. We also find that an\n\nordinary, reasonable lawyer would have called an endocrinologist and that it is reasonably probable\n\nthat such an investigation would have led to an expert who would have presented testimony similar\n\nto Dr. Boshell's.\n\n        The final part of the test for determining whether a defendant has been prejudiced by the\n\nfailure of counsel to locate an expert—whether defendant has shown that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the testimony would affect the sentence imposed, see Elledge, 823 F.2d at 1446 n.\n\n15—is the same for counsel's failure to develop and present non-expert testimony. Because a court\n\n\"must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury\" in determining whether a\n\ndefendant has shown that counsel's deficient performance was prejudicial, see Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, we examine counsels' failure to present expert testimony on Collier's\n\ndiabetes together with their failure to present other mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase\n\nof the trial in order to see if Collier has satisfied the second prong of the Strickland test.\n\n        Collier has sufficiently demonstrated that the failure of his counsel to make an offer of proof\n\non the record, or effectively to present at sentencing the wealth of mitigating evidence (including\n\nexpert testimony), creates a reasonable probability that, but for their errors, he would not have\n\nreceived a death sentence. \"The purpose of a sentencing hearing is to provide the jury with the\n\ninformation necessary for it to render an individualized sentencing determination ... [based upon]\n\nthe character and record of the individualized offender and the circumstances of the particular\n\noffense.\" Dobbs v. Turpin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72964\"><a href=\"/opinion/72964/dobbs-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1386-87 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted). The errors of Collier's counsel in the sentencing phase frustrated that purpose;\n\n\n                                                  36\n\fcounsel presented ten separate witnesses, including Collier's wife, whose relevant testimony\n\nconsisted almost entirely of one or two word answers to inquiries as to Collier's general reputation\n\nin the community, his reputation for truth and veracity, his reputation for hard work, and his\n\nreputation as a man who supports his family. The testimony of Collier's trial counsel in his habeas\n\ncorpus proceedings, as well as the affidavits of persons who either were interviewed by trial counsel\n\nbut not called to testify or who testified before the jury, demonstrates that counsel were aware of\n\nnumerous facts from Collier's personal, medical, and social history that would have led the jury to\n\nforego the death penalty.\n\n        In evaluating the probability that Collier's jury would have rejected the death penalty, we\n\nmust not forget to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors that would have been before the\n\njury in the absence of his counsels' errors. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. The\n\ndistrict court held that even if defense counsel were ineffective in every way alleged in Collier's\n\npetition, Collier would be unable to demonstrate prejudice because:\n\n        [t]he murder took place following an armed robbery; it involved a defendant who wrested\n        a police officer's gun from him, shot one officer, and then turned and killed the officer whose\n        gun he had taken; and the murder occurred in a rural community, where the murdered\n        officer was widely known.\n\nThe first two factors listed by the district court generally represent the aggravating circumstances\n\nof Collier's murder conviction: he killed a police officer while trying to prevent his arrest for the\n\ncommission of another felony. Although we do not underestimate the strength of these aggravating\n\nfactors, we believe that there is at least a reasonable probability that a jury confronted with the stark\n\ncontrast between Collier's acts on the day of the crimes and his history would not have voted for the\n\ndeath sentence. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390 (quoting Jackson v. Herring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684428\"><a href=\"/opinion/684428/patricia-ann-thomas-jackson-v-tommy-herring-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1366 (11th\n\nCir.1995), for the proposition that \"[m]any death penalty cases involve murders that are carefully\n\n                                                   37\n\fplanned, or accompanied by torture, rape, or kidnaping\"). Had counsel presented the wealth of\n\nmitigating evidence that they gathered in preparation for the sentencing phase of the trial, see supra\n\nnote 19, we believe there is a reasonable probability that consideration of these facts would have led\n\nthe jury to a different result. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390-91 (affirming grant of the writ in case\n\nwhere evidence of \"unfortunate upbringing\" was not investigated by counsel and not presented\n\nduring the sentencing phase of defendant's trial).\n\n        On the other hand, the third factor listed by the district court—that the murder occurred in\n\na rural community where the officer was widely known—seems to suggest that the people of the\n\ncommunity could not adequately put aside their anger about the crime to reach a detached and\n\ninformed sentencing decision based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case.\n\nAlthough taking into account the righteous anger of the jurors at the killing of a person well-known\n\nto them might have given the district court a more accurate idea of whether a 1978 Catoosa County\n\njury would have opted for a sentence of life imprisonment had they heard all of the mitigating\n\nevidence, such considerations run afoul of Strickland. \"The assessment of prejudice should proceed\n\non the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying\n\nthe standards that govern the decision.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068 (emphasis\n\nadded). We must therefore assume that the jurors could put aside their passions and render a\n\nsentence based upon the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case as presented to them.\n\nUnder such an assumption, we believe that the jury would have come to a different result.\n\n       In conclusion, we reiterate the Supreme Court's statement in Strickland that\n\n       the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose\n       result is being challenged. In every case the court should be concerned with whether, despite\n       the strong presumption of reliability, the result of the particular proceeding is unreliable\n\n\n                                                 38\n\f        because of a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just\n        results.\n\nId. at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. By failing to seek expert testimony regarding the effect of Collier's\n\ndiabetes upon his ability to control his behavior on the day of the crimes, and by failing to present\n\nevidence of Collier's background that would have mitigated his sentence, Collier's counsel\n\nprecipitated a \"breakdown in the adversarial process.\" The jury was called upon to determine\n\nwhether a man whom they did not know would live or die; they were not presented with the\n\nparticularized circumstances of his past and of his actions on the day of the crime that would have\n\nallowed them fairly to balance the seriousness of his transgressions with the conditions of his life.\n\nHad they been able to do so, we believe that it is at least reasonably probable that the jury would\n\nhave returned a sentence other than death.\n\n                                                  III.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Robert Lewis Collier did not receive the effective\n\nassistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution, at the sentencing phase of his trial. We therefore AFFIRM the district court's denial\n\nof Collier's petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his convictions, REVERSE the ruling\n\nof the district court denying Collier's petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his sentence\n\nof death, and REMAND this case, with the instruction that the district court grant the writ of habeas\n\ncorpus vacating Collier's sentence of death.\n\n        AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   39\n\f</pre>",
