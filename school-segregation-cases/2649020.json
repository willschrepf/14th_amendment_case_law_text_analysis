INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiff Bridget Green, acting on behalf of her minor child, E.A., brought this action\n\nseeking an award of attorneys’ fees and costs arising from an administrative proceeding brought\n\non E.A.’s behalf under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Plaintiff contends that she\n\nis entitled to $53,385.52 in fees and costs because she prevailed in the administrative proceedings.\n\nDefendant District of Columbia counters that Plaintiff is entitled to some but not all of the fees and\n\ncosts requested because she did not prevail on all claims asserted. The District of Columbia also\n\nurges reduction of the award because (1) the proposed hourly rate for calculating fees is excessive\n\nand (2) some of the submitted fees and costs are unreasonable. Before the court are Plaintiff’s and\n\nDefendant’s respective Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. After considering the parties’\n\nsubmissions and the relevant law, the court grants in part and denies in part both motions and\n\nawards attorneys’ fees and costs to Plaintiff in the amount of $32,934.71.\n\f II.   BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n       At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff’s child, E.A., was a student in the District of\n\nColumbia’s public school system. On May 21, 2013, the District of Columbia Public Schools\n\n(“DCPS”) convened a meeting to develop an Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) for E.A.\n\nSee Hearing Officer Determination, ECF No. 9-5 at 7 [hereinafter HOD]. An IEP, as required by\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., is “a written\n\nstatement for each child with a disability” that includes “the child’s present levels of academic\n\nachievement and functional performance” and sets forth the “services” and “accommodations” to\n\nbe provided to the child, id. § 1404(14). In advance of E.A.’s IEP meeting, he was evaluated both\n\nby “independent professionals” who worked with him at his daycare facility and by “DCPS’s\n\neligibility team members” whose only contact with E.A. was for diagnostic purposes. See HOD at\n\n4; see also id. 5-7. The resulting IEP (the “Initial IEP”) required DCPS to provide E.A. with five\n\nhours per week of “Specialized Instruction” in a general education setting and two hours per month\n\nof both “Occupational Therapy” and “Speech-Language Pathology” outside of a general education\n\nsetting. Initial IEP, ECF No. 19-1 at 8. The Initial IEP concluded that E.A. had a “developmental\n\ndelay” but “rejected the disability classification of autism spectrum disorder” advanced by Plaintiff,\n\nHOD at 7, and expressly declined to provide E.A. with a “dedicated aide,” Initial IEP at 8.\n\nThereafter, E.A. was assigned to a general education classroom at a DCPS school. See HOD at 7.\n\n       Dissatisfied with the Initial IEP, Plaintiff hired counsel and on September 12, 2013, filed an\n\nadministrative due process complaint against DCPS alleging that the Initial IEP denied E.A. the\n\n“free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) to which he is entitled under the IDEA. 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400(d)(1)(A); see also Pl.’s Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 9-\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f4 at 2 [hereinafter Pl’s Mot.]. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Initial IEP (1) failed to\n\n“offer appropriate related services in the areas of occupational therapy [], speech/language and\n\nbehavioral support and a 1-to-1-aide, and fail[ed] to offer appropriate specialized instruction and\n\nindividualized classroom support/accommodations”; (2) improperly classified E.A. “as\n\ndevelopmentally delayed instead of autistic”; (3) failed “to offer placement in a full-time program\n\nthat provides full-time special education services in a small class setting with specially trained\n\nteachers”; and (4) failed “to take into account the conclusions, recommendations and other\n\ninformation in [E.A.]’s independent evaluations . . . .” HOD at 1; see also Def.’s Stmt. of\n\nUndisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 11-2 at ¶ 3 [hereinafter Def.’s Stmt. of Facts]; Def.’s Cross-\n\nMot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 11-1 at 2 [hereinafter Def.’s\n\nMot.]. Plaintiff requested six remedies that collectively, she alleged, would guarantee E.A. a FAPE.\n\nHOD at 2; see also Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 4.\n\n         DCPS held E.A.’s due process hearing on November 5-6, 2013, during which Plaintiff and\n\nE.A. were represented by counsel. Def.’s Stmt. of Facts at ¶ 6; see also HOD at 2. The hearing\n\nofficer issued her “determination” on November 17, 2013. Def.’s Stmt. of Facts at ¶ 7; see also\n\ngenerally HOD. In it, the hearing officer framed the issues before her as follows:\n\n         1. Did DCPS develop an inappropriate IEP in May 2013?\n         2. Did DCPS deny Student a FAPE by failing to offer placement in a full-time\n            program that offers full-time special education services in a small class setting\n            with specially trained teachers because the proposed DCPS school is\n            inappropriate?\n         3. Did DCPS deny Student a FAPE by failing to take into account\n            recommendations and other information in Student’s independent evaluation?\n\n\nHOD at 3.1\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiff “withdrew” what was initially her second claim, see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 6—that E.A. was inappropriately\nclassified “as developmentally delayed instead of autistic”—after the hearing officer advised her that it “should be\nmerged with [her first claim—the appropriateness of the IEP],” HOD at 1. Defendant argues that, in evaluating\n\n                                                          3\n\f         As to the first issue, the hearing officer determined “that DCPS denied [E.A.] a FAPE by\n\nfailing to comply with the procedures set forth in IDEA regarding initial evaluations.” HOD at 8.\n\nThese procedural deficiencies, the hearing officer found, prevented her from making a final\n\njudgment about the appropriateness of the Initial IEP. Id. (“[T]he hearing officer cannot confirm\n\nthat the IEP is reasonably calculated to provide Student with educational benefits.”). The hearing\n\nofficer similarly found that she could not make a final determination about the second issue—the\n\nappropriateness of E.A.’s school placement. Id. at 9 (“As the appropriateness of a student’s\n\nassigned location of services turns on whether the location can implement an appropriate IEP for\n\na given student, the hearing officer concludes that the existing evidence is insufficient to allow a\n\ndetermination of the appropriateness of Student’s assigned location of services for SY 2013/14.”).\n\nWith the aim of resolving the first two issues, the hearing officer ordered DCPS to administer\n\nadditional evaluations to E.A. and to convene a meeting to revise the Initial IEP and alter E.A.’s\n\nschool placement as appropriate. Id. at 10. As to the third issue, the hearing officer concluded\n\nthat Plaintiff “failed to meet its burden of proof,” id. at 9, and denied and dismissed with prejudice\n\nPlaintiff’s claim that DCPS failed to adequately consider E.A.’s independent evaluations, id. at 10.\n\n         DCPS conducted additional evaluations of E.A., as ordered by the hearing officer. See\n\nParties’ Joint Resp. to Court’s Order of Feb. 11, 2015, ECF No. 18 at 1-2, 4 [hereinafter Parties’\n\nJoint Resp.]. On January 16, 2014, and February 13, 2014, DCPS convened meetings for the\n\npurpose of revising, as appropriate, the Initial IEP. Id. These meetings produced a revised IEP,\n\nissued on February 16, 2014 (the “Revised IEP”), which differed in several ways from the\n\n\n\nPlaintiff’s success in the administrative proceeding, the court should treat Plaintiff as having advanced four claims\ninstead of the three that the hearing officer identified. See, e.g., Def.’s Mot. at 1 (“Four issues were certified for\nhearing.”); id. at 13 (“Plaintiff was successful on only one out of the four issues certified for the hearing[.]”). However,\nfor purposes of its analysis, the court will focus on the three claims as defined by the hearing officer and will not treat\nthe fourth “withdrawn” claim as an unsuccessful claim, because it was “merged” with another claim upon suggestion\nof the hearing officer.\n\n                                                             4\n\fInitial IEP. See id. at 2-5. E.A.’s “Occupational Therapy” treatment increased from two to\n\nthree hours per month; his “Speech-Language Pathology” treatment increased from two to four\n\nhours per month; and his “Behavioral Support Services” increased from zero to two hours per\n\nmonth. Id. at 2; Revised IEP, ECF No. 19-2 at 11. The Revised IEP did not, however, alter E.A.’s\n\nschool placement, which remained “a large general education classroom with approximately 17-\n\n18 students,” Parties’ Joint Resp. at 3; nor did it reclassify E.A. as autistic, id. at 3, 5.\n\n        B. Procedural History\n\n        On May 5, 2015, Plaintiff submitted to DCPS an application requesting payment of\n\n$53,385.52 in attorneys’ fees and costs arising from the representation of E.A. Compl., ECF No.\n\n1 ¶ 5. Plaintiff received no response to her application and, on June 6, 2014, filed a complaint with\n\nthis court asking that it award her the full amount requested. Id. ¶ B. On July 30, 2014, Plaintiff\n\nmoved for Summary Judgment, and on September 12, 2014, Defendant did the same. See\n\ngenerally Pl.’s Mot.; Def.’s Mot. Thereafter, at the request of the court, see Order, ECF No. 16,\n\nthe parties jointly submitted supplemental information about DCPS’ implementation of the HOD\n\nand the contents of the Revised IEP, see Parties’ Joint Resp. Defendant also submitted redacted\n\nversions of both the Initial and the Revised IEP. See Notice of Filing of Redacted Docs., ECF No.\n\n19.\n\nIII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n        A. Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n        A court should grant a motion for summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “[A] material fact is ‘genuine’ . . . if the evidence is such that a reasonable\n\njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party” on an element of the claim. Anderson v.\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). Where parties file cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, “neither party waives the right to a full trial on the merits by filing its own motion; each\n\nside concedes that no material facts are at issue only for the purposes of its own motion.”\n\nSherwood v. Wash. Post, 871 F.2d 1144, 1147 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (citation omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “[E]ach [party] must carry its own burden under the applicable legal\n\nstandard.” Ehrman v. United States, 429 F. Supp. 2d 61, 67 (D.D.C. 2006) (citation omitted). If\n\na party “has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to\n\nwhich it has the burden of proof,” the other party is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex Corp.\n\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 317-18 (1986).\n\n       B. The IDEA\n\n       The IDEA was enacted “to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to\n\nthem a [FAPE] that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their\n\nunique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living.”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). A FAPE requires that each child with a disability receive “special\n\neducation and related services that” are “provided at public expense” and “in conformity with the\n\n[child’s IEP].” Id. § 1401(9). The IDEA permits an individual to file a due process complaint\n\nand participate in an administrative hearing should she believe that a school district is denying a\n\nstudent a FAPE. Id. §§ 1415(b)-(c).\n\n       A “court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to a\n\nprevailing party [in an administrative proceeding] who is the parent of a child with a disability.”\n\nId. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(i).   In analyzing a request for attorneys’ fees, a court must determine\n\n(1) “whether a party has prevailed and the extent to which it has prevailed,” and (2) “whether the\n\nattorneys’ fees being sought are reasonable.” A.S. v. District of Columbia, 842 F. Supp. 2d 40, 46\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f(D.D.C. 2012) (citation omitted); see also Jackson v. District of Columbia, 696 F. Supp. 2d 97,\n\n101 (D.D.C. 2010) (“A court’s determination of the appropriate attorney’s fees, in other words, is\n\nbased on a two-step inquiry. First, the court must determine whether the party seeking attorney’s\n\nfees is the prevailing party. . . . Second, the court must determine whether the attorney’s fees\n\nsought are reasonable.”) (citing 20 U.S.C. §1415(i)(3)(B)). Both inquiries—the degree to which\n\nPlaintiff prevailed and the determination of reasonableness—are at issue in this case.\n\nIV.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The court turns first to the parties’ dispute over whether the attorneys’ fees sought should\n\nbe reduced based on the extent to which Plaintiff prevailed at the administrative hearing. It then\n\nconsiders their disagreement over the applicable hourly rate.          Finally, the court addresses\n\nDefendant’s specific objections to certain time entries and claimed costs.\n\n       A. Extent to Which Plaintiff Prevailed\n\n               1. The “prevailing party” threshold\n\n       A plaintiff must be a prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees under the IDEA. 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(i)(3)(B). “[P]laintiffs may be considered ‘prevailing parties’ for attorney’s fees purposes\n\nif they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties\n\nsought in bringing suit.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (quoting Nadeau v.\n\nHelgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-89 (1st Cir. 1978). This “generous” standard does not guarantee a\n\nplaintiff full fees—it “brings the plaintiff only across the statutory threshold.” Id.\n\n       Here, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff surpassed the prevailing party threshold. Def.’s\n\nMot. at 1. (“Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff obtained some relief as a result of the\n\nhearing[.]”). Defendant argues, however, that Plaintiff is not entitled to the entirety of the\n\nrequested fees because she “was denied the majority of the relief that she sought.” Id. Defendant\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fcontends that Plaintiff prevailed on only one issue—the appropriateness of the IEP—and was\n\n“denied the most significant portions of relief that she requested including immediate funding and\n\nplacement for the student at an appropriate program proposed by Parent, with transportation and\n\nall related services, as well as compensatory education consisting of social skills training and\n\nacademic tutoring.” Id. at 12. Plaintiff counters that she “was the prevailing party and found to\n\nbe entitled to specified special education services that DCPS had failed or refused to provide.”\n\nPl.’s Mot. 2. Plaintiff further argues that she “was successful on the core issue in the case. Success\n\nwas achieved because the additional testing was ordered and a new IEP reflecting this had to be\n\ndeveloped.” Pl’s Reply to Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Def.’s Cross-\n\nMot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 12 at 5 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply].\n\n         The court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff prevailed only in part but finds that\n\nPlaintiff’s success was nonetheless significant. In Hensley v. Eckerhart, the Supreme Court\n\nestablished a two-step inquiry to determine the attorneys’ fees to be awarded to a partially\n\nsuccessful plaintiff, emphasizing that the district court has substantial discretion in awarding such\n\nfees. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (“We reemphasize that the district court has discretion in\n\ndetermining the amount of a fee award.”);2 Goos v. Nat’l Ass’n of Realtors, 997 F.2d 1565, 1571\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (“These equitable judgments are left to the discretion of the district court.”) (citing\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37); Nelson v. District of Columbia, 967 F. Supp. 2d 360, 362 (D.D.C.\n\n2013) (stating that “the first Hensley prong opens the door wide for discretion short of abuse”).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Although Hensley involved fee-shifting under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the Court explicitly noted that the “standards set\nforth in [its] opinion are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a\n‘prevailing party.’” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 n.7. Courts in this circuit have consistently applied the two-step Hensley\ninquiry in IDEA cases. See, e.g., A.S., 842 F. Supp. 2d at 46-47; B.R. v. District of Columbia, 802 F. Supp. 2d 153,\n163-65 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n                                                           8\n\f               2. First Hensley inquiry\n\n       The first inquiry under Hensley directs courts to consider whether “the plaintiff fail[ed] to\n\nprevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n434. If a court determines that an unsuccessful claim is not related to a successful claim, it “must\n\nconfine fee awards to work done on the successful claims” by “weeding out work done on\n\nunrelated unsuccessful claims from any award.” George Hyman Const. Co. v. Brooks, 963 F.2d\n\n1532, 1535 (D.C. Cir. 1992). If, however, “the plaintiff’s claims for relief . . . involve a common\n\ncore of facts or [are] based on related legal theories” and “[m]uch of counsel’s time [is] devoted\n\ngenerally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-\n\nby-claim basis,” courts should move to the second Hensley inquiry without reducing the fees\n\nsought by a plaintiff. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. Claims need not have a “complete factual overlap”\n\nin order to be related. Goos, 997 F.2d at 1570.\n\n       In this case, the three issues addressed by the hearing officer shared a common core of facts\n\nand were premised on similar legal theories—the development and issuance of the Initial IEP and\n\nthe inadequacy of the Initial IEP—and were therefore related. The first issue focused on the\n\nsubstance of the Initial IEP, asking whether it, as a whole, was appropriate. HOD at 8. The second\n\nissue concerned the propriety of E.A.’s school placement, which the hearing officer declared\n\ndepended on the appropriateness of the Initial IEP. See id. at 9 (“[T]he appropriateness of a\n\nstudent’s assigned location of services turns on whether the location can implement an appropriate\n\nIEP for a given student[.]”). And the third issue, which focused on the process of developing the\n\nInitial IEP, i.e., whether DCPS sufficiently considered E.A.’s independent evaluations, also clearly\n\nshared that same common core of facts. It is thus difficult to segregate the hours expended by\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fPlaintiff’s counsel on the successful claims from the unsuccessful claims. The court will not\n\nreduce the attorney’s fees sought under the first Hensley inquiry.\n\n               3. Second Hensley inquiry\n\n        The second inquiry under Hensley requires a court to analyze the “degree of success\n\nobtained” by a plaintiff. 461 U.S. at 436. “Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his\n\nattorney should recover a full compensatory fee.” Id. at 435. Where “a plaintiff has achieved only\n\npartial or limited success . . . [t]he district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should\n\nbe eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.” Id. at 436-\n\n37. “There is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations”; rather, the second\n\ninquiry under Hensley is an “equitable judgment” in which a “court necessarily has discretion.”\n\nId. at 437.\n\n        Here, the court finds that Plaintiff obtained a high degree of success for E.A., though not\n\nthe “excellent results” that would warrant the full, undiminished award sought by Plaintiff. The\n\nadministrative hearing addressed three related issues. Plaintiff sought a variety of different\n\nremedies. But at bottom, Plaintiff initiated the IDEA administrative hearing contending that DCPS\n\nhad denied E.A. a FAPE and seeking to remedy that denial through additional testing and the\n\nrevision of his IEP. The hearing officer determined that E.A. was, in fact, denied a FAPE and\n\nordered DCPS to revise E.A.’s IEP as appropriate. DCPS revised the IEP by, among other\n\nadjustments, increasing the Occupational Therapy, Speech-Language Pathology, and Behavioral\n\nSupport Services to be provided to E.A. These revisions demonstrate the inadequacy of the Initial\n\nIEP and Plaintiff’s success as to the core of its litigation effort—improving E.A.’s IEP. Because\n\nPlaintiff achieved important improvements in E.A.’s IEP, the court does not believe it would be\n\nfair to award her 50 percent or less of her counsel’s fees, as Defendant urges.\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f       But Plaintiff fell short on two important fronts—a specialized school placement for E.A.\n\nand a diagnosis of autism, which presumably would have brought with it additional services. She\n\nalso did not prevail on her claim that DCPS inadequately considered E.A.’s independent\n\nevaluations. A reduction of 35 percent, in the court’s view, fairly reflects Plaintiff’s overall success\n\non E.A.’s behalf while recognizing the aspects of relief on which she did not prevail.\n\n       B. Reasonable Hourly Rate\n\n       The parties dispute the hourly rate on which to base the fee award. Plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the hourly rate sought. In re North, 59 F.3d 184,\n\n189 (D.C. Cir. 1995). She must support her proposed hourly rate with evidence “that the requested\n\nrates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar lawyers of reasonably\n\ncomparable skill, experience, and reputation.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n. 11 (1984).\n\nSuch an hourly rate “is normally deemed to be reasonable, and is referred to—for convenience—\n\nas the prevailing market rate.” Id.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the prevailing hourly market rate in IDEA cases is $510 for attorneys\n\nwith her counsel’s years of experience and $145 for experienced paralegals. Pl.’s Mot. at 5-6.\n\nPlaintiff derived these rates from the Laffey Matrix. See id. at 6-9; see Laffey Matrix (2003-2014),\n\nECF No. 9-10. The Laffey Matrix is a fee schedule maintained by the Civil Division of the United\n\nStates Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, “which sets out compensable billing rates\n\nfor attorneys in the District of Columbia and has been adopted by the judges of this District in\n\nmany cases.” Bucher v. District of Columbia, 777 F. Supp. 2d 69, 74 (D.D.C. 2011) (citation\n\nomitted). Plaintiff asserts that, because of her counsel’s “extensive legal experience,” which\n\nconsists of “over 30 years” of practicing law, Pl.’s Mot. at 7, and the “complex” nature of the\n\nhearing at issue, see id. at 2-5, the full Laffey rates are appropriate. Defendant counters that,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fbecause E.A.’s administrative proceeding “was not novel or complex,” the court should reduce the\n\nLaffey rate by 25 percent. Def.’s Mot. at 11.\n\n       Although some courts in this district have applied a diminished Laffey rate in IDEA cases,\n\nsee, e.g., Rooths v. District of Columbia, 802 F. Supp. 2d 56, 63 (D.D.C. 2011); Agapito v. District\n\nof Columbia, 525 F. Supp. 2d 150, 152-55 (D.D.C. 2007), this court sees no reason to do so here.\n\nPlaintiff’s counsel has extensive experience practicing law in the District of Columbia and, in\n\nparticular, litigating IDEA cases. See Decl. of Elizabeth T. Jester, Esq., ECF No. 9-2, ¶ 6 (“I have\n\nparticipated in hundreds of administrative due process hearings pursuant to IDEA and procured\n\ncountless settlement agreements in IDEA cases in the District of Columbia.”). Her paralegal has\n\nworked with Plaintiff’s counsel for 19 years. Id. ¶ 14. And this case was not, as the District\n\ncontends, uncomplicated. The administrative hearing at issue, which lasted for two days, involved\n\ntestimony from nine witnesses—including five experts—and 22 exhibits—including various\n\nevaluations of E.A. Pl.’s Mot. at 3. The administrative hearing was preceded by a “lengthy\n\nprehearing conference.” Id. Additionally, counsel’s preparation for the hearing occurred over five\n\nmonths, and she expended additional time over three different months to prepare for the post-\n\nhearing IEP meeting. See Invoice, ECF No. 9-6. Courts in this district “ha[ve] rejected the\n\nsuggestion that IDEA administrative litigation is categorically less complex than other forms of\n\nlitigation” and “reaffirm[ed] that IDEA cases are sufficiently complex to allow application of the\n\nLaffey Matrix.” Irving v. District of Columbia, 815 F. Supp. 2d 119, 129 (D.D.C. 2011); see\n\nalso Jackson, 696 F. Supp. 2d at 102 (applying the Laffey Matrix and stating that “numerous judges\n\nin this district have applied Laffey rates in the context of fee awards arising out of IDEA\n\nadministrative proceedings”) (citations omitted); Young v. District of Columbia, 893 F. Supp. 2d\n\n125, 130-31 (D.D.C. 2012) (noting that courts in this district have not had “a unified approach to\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fthe proper rates for attorneys’ fees in IDEA cases” and “exercis[ing] . . . discretion to apply the\n\nrates that plaintiffs requested, which are equal to the Laffey Matrix rates”). The court applies the\n\nfull Laffey rates here.\n\n        C. Reduction of Specific Fees and Costs\n\n        Defendant requests (1) a reduction of fees for specific tasks undertaken by Plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel, namely, (a) travel to hearings and meetings in the District of Columbia and (b) drafting\n\nthe due process complaint, and (2) a reduction of certain administrative costs. The court finds a\n\n50 percent reduction of fees for travel to be appropriate, but will not reduce the fees incurred for\n\ndrafting the IDEA complaint or the administrative costs.\n\n                1. Reduction of Fees\n\n                          a. Travel\n\n        Defendant asserts, and Plaintiff does not contest, that $5,433.46 of the fees and costs sought\n\nare attributable to travel by Plaintiff’s counsel. See Def.’s Mot. at 14; see also Invoice at 6, 8, 9.\n\n“In this circuit, travel time generally is compensated at no more than half the attorney’s appropriate\n\nhourly rate.” Blackman v. District of Columbia, 397 F. Supp. 2d 12, 15 (D.D.C. 2005) (citation\n\nomitted). Plaintiff concedes that a 50 percent rate reduction is proper for travel time. Pl.’s Reply\n\nat 7 (“[U]ndersigned counsel is willing to accept as reasonable in this case Defendant’s proposal\n\nthat compensation or travel time be at 50 percent of her hourly rate.”). This court therefore will\n\nreduce the fees Plaintiff seeks for travel by 50 percent after applying the 35 percent reduction,\n\nwhich is applicable to all fees requested.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                           b. Due process complaint\n\n         Defendant asserts that the 7.4 hours spent by Plaintiff’s counsel to draft and finalize the\n\n“Due Process Complaint Notice” was unreasonable.3 Invoice at 5. Defendant argues that “[t]he\n\namount billed to draft this Complaint was excessive and should be reduced accordingly; it is highly\n\nunlikely that it took nearly almost an entire business day to draft what is mostly a form complaint,\n\nand in any event, is only three pages in length.” Def.’s Mot. at 15. In support of its assertion,\n\nDefendant cites a single case in which a court reduced by 50 percent the fees requested for 10.5\n\nhours “to review both parties’ disclosures and prepare for the due process hearing.” Id. The court\n\nfinds it reasonable that counsel would have spent a business day drafting and refining what would\n\nserve as the framework pleading for the administrative hearing. The court therefore declines to\n\nreduce the attorneys’ fees sought for drafting the complaint.\n\n                  2. Reduction of administrative costs\n\n         Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s counsel “billed an excessive amount for faxing and\n\nphotocopying costs” and asks the court to limit reimbursement for such costs to $113.10. Id. The\n\ncourt finds that these costs, which Plaintiff’s counsel has repeatedly “averred . . . are accurate,”\n\nPl.’s Reply at 11, are reasonable. The court will not further reduce Plaintiff’s reimbursement for\n\nsuch costs; it will, however, reduce such costs by 35 percent, in line with the reduction made to\n\nthe award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  In its Reply brief, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s time entries of “2.7 hours reviewing records, 2 hours in ‘phone\nconsults’ and 2.4 hours of ‘correspondence,’” are also attributable to Plaintiff’s drafting of the due process complaint.\nDef.’s Reply to Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 14 at 5. “Taken together, that is 14.5 hours\ntoward writing, again, what amounts to a three-page due process complaint. Accordingly, the entire 14.5 hours should\nbe reduced by 50% because the number of hours billed are excessive and unreasonable.” Id. The court’s unchanged\nby Defendant’s amended argument.\n\n\n                                                          14\n\f V.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff’s and\n\nDefendant’s respective Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff is awarded $32,934.71\n\nin attorneys’ fees and costs under the IDEA. A separate Order accompanies this memorandum\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiff Bridget Green, acting on behalf of her minor child, E.A., brought this action\n\nseeking an award of attorneys’ fees and costs arising from an administrative proceeding brought\n\non E.A.’s behalf under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Plaintiff contends that she\n\nis entitled to $53,385.52 in fees and costs because she prevailed in the administrative proceedings.\n\nDefendant District of Columbia counters that Plaintiff is entitled to some but not all of the fees and\n\ncosts requested because she did not prevail on all claims asserted. The District of Columbia also\n\nurges reduction of the award because (1) the proposed hourly rate for calculating fees is excessive\n\nand (2) some of the submitted fees and costs are unreasonable. Before the court are Plaintiff’s and\n\nDefendant’s respective Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. After considering the parties’\n\nsubmissions and the relevant law, the court grants in part and denies in part both motions and\n\nawards attorneys’ fees and costs to Plaintiff in the amount of $32,934.71.\n\f II.   BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n       At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff’s child, E.A., was a student in the District of\n\nColumbia’s public school system. On May 21, 2013, the District of Columbia Public Schools\n\n(“DCPS”) convened a meeting to develop an Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) for E.A.\n\nSee Hearing Officer Determination, ECF No. 9-5 at 7 [hereinafter HOD]. An IEP, as required by\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., is “a written\n\nstatement for each child with a disability” that includes “the child’s present levels of academic\n\nachievement and functional performance” and sets forth the “services” and “accommodations” to\n\nbe provided to the child, id. § 1404(14). In advance of E.A.’s IEP meeting, he was evaluated both\n\nby “independent professionals” who worked with him at his daycare facility and by “DCPS’s\n\neligibility team members” whose only contact with E.A. was for diagnostic purposes. See HOD at\n\n4; see also id. 5-7. The resulting IEP (the “Initial IEP”) required DCPS to provide E.A. with five\n\nhours per week of “Specialized Instruction” in a general education setting and two hours per month\n\nof both “Occupational Therapy” and “Speech-Language Pathology” outside of a general education\n\nsetting. Initial IEP, ECF No. 19-1 at 8. The Initial IEP concluded that E.A. had a “developmental\n\ndelay” but “rejected the disability classification of autism spectrum disorder” advanced by Plaintiff,\n\nHOD at 7, and expressly declined to provide E.A. with a “dedicated aide,” Initial IEP at 8.\n\nThereafter, E.A. was assigned to a general education classroom at a DCPS school. See HOD at 7.\n\n       Dissatisfied with the Initial IEP, Plaintiff hired counsel and on September 12, 2013, filed an\n\nadministrative due process complaint against DCPS alleging that the Initial IEP denied E.A. the\n\n“free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) to which he is entitled under the IDEA. 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400(d)(1)(A); see also Pl.’s Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 9-\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f4 at 2 [hereinafter Pl’s Mot.]. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Initial IEP (1) failed to\n\n“offer appropriate related services in the areas of occupational therapy [], speech/language and\n\nbehavioral support and a 1-to-1-aide, and fail[ed] to offer appropriate specialized instruction and\n\nindividualized classroom support/accommodations”; (2) improperly classified E.A. “as\n\ndevelopmentally delayed instead of autistic”; (3) failed “to offer placement in a full-time program\n\nthat provides full-time special education services in a small class setting with specially trained\n\nteachers”; and (4) failed “to take into account the conclusions, recommendations and other\n\ninformation in [E.A.]’s independent evaluations . . . .” HOD at 1; see also Def.’s Stmt. of\n\nUndisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 11-2 at ¶ 3 [hereinafter Def.’s Stmt. of Facts]; Def.’s Cross-\n\nMot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 11-1 at 2 [hereinafter Def.’s\n\nMot.]. Plaintiff requested six remedies that collectively, she alleged, would guarantee E.A. a FAPE.\n\nHOD at 2; see also Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 4.\n\n         DCPS held E.A.’s due process hearing on November 5-6, 2013, during which Plaintiff and\n\nE.A. were represented by counsel. Def.’s Stmt. of Facts at ¶ 6; see also HOD at 2. The hearing\n\nofficer issued her “determination” on November 17, 2013. Def.’s Stmt. of Facts at ¶ 7; see also\n\ngenerally HOD. In it, the hearing officer framed the issues before her as follows:\n\n         1. Did DCPS develop an inappropriate IEP in May 2013?\n         2. Did DCPS deny Student a FAPE by failing to offer placement in a full-time\n            program that offers full-time special education services in a small class setting\n            with specially trained teachers because the proposed DCPS school is\n            inappropriate?\n         3. Did DCPS deny Student a FAPE by failing to take into account\n            recommendations and other information in Student’s independent evaluation?\n\n\nHOD at 3.1\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiff “withdrew” what was initially her second claim, see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 6—that E.A. was inappropriately\nclassified “as developmentally delayed instead of autistic”—after the hearing officer advised her that it “should be\nmerged with [her first claim—the appropriateness of the IEP],” HOD at 1. Defendant argues that, in evaluating\n\n                                                          3\n\f         As to the first issue, the hearing officer determined “that DCPS denied [E.A.] a FAPE by\n\nfailing to comply with the procedures set forth in IDEA regarding initial evaluations.” HOD at 8.\n\nThese procedural deficiencies, the hearing officer found, prevented her from making a final\n\njudgment about the appropriateness of the Initial IEP. Id. (“[T]he hearing officer cannot confirm\n\nthat the IEP is reasonably calculated to provide Student with educational benefits.”). The hearing\n\nofficer similarly found that she could not make a final determination about the second issue—the\n\nappropriateness of E.A.’s school placement. Id. at 9 (“As the appropriateness of a student’s\n\nassigned location of services turns on whether the location can implement an appropriate IEP for\n\na given student, the hearing officer concludes that the existing evidence is insufficient to allow a\n\ndetermination of the appropriateness of Student’s assigned location of services for SY 2013/14.”).\n\nWith the aim of resolving the first two issues, the hearing officer ordered DCPS to administer\n\nadditional evaluations to E.A. and to convene a meeting to revise the Initial IEP and alter E.A.’s\n\nschool placement as appropriate. Id. at 10. As to the third issue, the hearing officer concluded\n\nthat Plaintiff “failed to meet its burden of proof,” id. at 9, and denied and dismissed with prejudice\n\nPlaintiff’s claim that DCPS failed to adequately consider E.A.’s independent evaluations, id. at 10.\n\n         DCPS conducted additional evaluations of E.A., as ordered by the hearing officer. See\n\nParties’ Joint Resp. to Court’s Order of Feb. 11, 2015, ECF No. 18 at 1-2, 4 [hereinafter Parties’\n\nJoint Resp.]. On January 16, 2014, and February 13, 2014, DCPS convened meetings for the\n\npurpose of revising, as appropriate, the Initial IEP. Id. These meetings produced a revised IEP,\n\nissued on February 16, 2014 (the “Revised IEP”), which differed in several ways from the\n\n\n\nPlaintiff’s success in the administrative proceeding, the court should treat Plaintiff as having advanced four claims\ninstead of the three that the hearing officer identified. See, e.g., Def.’s Mot. at 1 (“Four issues were certified for\nhearing.”); id. at 13 (“Plaintiff was successful on only one out of the four issues certified for the hearing[.]”). However,\nfor purposes of its analysis, the court will focus on the three claims as defined by the hearing officer and will not treat\nthe fourth “withdrawn” claim as an unsuccessful claim, because it was “merged” with another claim upon suggestion\nof the hearing officer.\n\n                                                             4\n\fInitial IEP. See id. at 2-5. E.A.’s “Occupational Therapy” treatment increased from two to\n\nthree hours per month; his “Speech-Language Pathology” treatment increased from two to four\n\nhours per month; and his “Behavioral Support Services” increased from zero to two hours per\n\nmonth. Id. at 2; Revised IEP, ECF No. 19-2 at 11. The Revised IEP did not, however, alter E.A.’s\n\nschool placement, which remained “a large general education classroom with approximately 17-\n\n18 students,” Parties’ Joint Resp. at 3; nor did it reclassify E.A. as autistic, id. at 3, 5.\n\n        B. Procedural History\n\n        On May 5, 2015, Plaintiff submitted to DCPS an application requesting payment of\n\n$53,385.52 in attorneys’ fees and costs arising from the representation of E.A. Compl., ECF No.\n\n1 ¶ 5. Plaintiff received no response to her application and, on June 6, 2014, filed a complaint with\n\nthis court asking that it award her the full amount requested. Id. ¶ B. On July 30, 2014, Plaintiff\n\nmoved for Summary Judgment, and on September 12, 2014, Defendant did the same. See\n\ngenerally Pl.’s Mot.; Def.’s Mot. Thereafter, at the request of the court, see Order, ECF No. 16,\n\nthe parties jointly submitted supplemental information about DCPS’ implementation of the HOD\n\nand the contents of the Revised IEP, see Parties’ Joint Resp. Defendant also submitted redacted\n\nversions of both the Initial and the Revised IEP. See Notice of Filing of Redacted Docs., ECF No.\n\n19.\n\nIII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n        A. Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n        A court should grant a motion for summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “[A] material fact is ‘genuine’ . . . if the evidence is such that a reasonable\n\njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party” on an element of the claim. Anderson v.\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fLiberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1986). Where parties file cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, “neither party waives the right to a full trial on the merits by filing its own motion; each\n\nside concedes that no material facts are at issue only for the purposes of its own motion.”\n\nSherwood v. Wash. Post, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520975\"><a href=\"/opinion/520975/thomas-r-sherwood-v-the-washington-post/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1147 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (citation omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “[E]ach [party] must carry its own burden under the applicable legal\n\nstandard.” Ehrman v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2487592\"><a href=\"/opinion/2487592/ehrman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (D.D.C. 2006) (citation omitted). If\n\na party “has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to\n\nwhich it has the burden of proof,” the other party is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex Corp.\n\nv. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317-18 (1986).\n\n       B. The IDEA\n\n       The IDEA was enacted “to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to\n\nthem a [FAPE] that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their\n\nunique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living.”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). A FAPE requires that each child with a disability receive “special\n\neducation and related services that” are “provided at public expense” and “in conformity with the\n\n[child’s IEP].” Id. § 1401(9). The IDEA permits an individual to file a due process complaint\n\nand participate in an administrative hearing should she believe that a school district is denying a\n\nstudent a FAPE. Id. §§ 1415(b)-(c).\n\n       A “court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to a\n\nprevailing party [in an administrative proceeding] who is the parent of a child with a disability.”\n\nId. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(i).   In analyzing a request for attorneys’ fees, a court must determine\n\n(1) “whether a party has prevailed and the extent to which it has prevailed,” and (2) “whether the\n\nattorneys’ fees being sought are reasonable.” A.S. v.

First, the court must determine whether the party seeking attorney’s\n\nfees is the prevailing party. . . . Second, the court must determine whether the attorney’s fees\n\nsought are reasonable.”) (citing 20 U.S.C. §1415(i)(3)(B)). Both inquiries—the degree to which\n\nPlaintiff prevailed and the determination of reasonableness—are at issue in this case.\n\nIV.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The court turns first to the parties’ dispute over whether the attorneys’ fees sought should\n\nbe reduced based on the extent to which Plaintiff prevailed at the administrative hearing. It then\n\nconsiders their disagreement over the applicable hourly rate.          Finally, the court addresses\n\nDefendant’s specific objections to certain time entries and claimed costs.\n\n       A. Extent to Which Plaintiff Prevailed\n\n               1. The “prevailing party” threshold\n\n       A plaintiff must be a prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees under the IDEA. 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(i)(3)(B). “[P]laintiffs may be considered ‘prevailing parties’ for attorney’s fees purposes\n\nif they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties\n\nsought in bringing suit.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1983) (quoting Nadeau v.\n\nHelgemoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358671\"><a href=\"/opinion/358671/larry-nadeau-v-raymond-a-helgemoe-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278-89 (1st Cir. 1978). This “generous” standard does not guarantee a\n\nplaintiff full fees—it “brings the plaintiff only across the statutory threshold.” Id.\n\n       Here, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff surpassed the prevailing party threshold. Def.’s\n\nMot. at 1. (“Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff obtained some relief as a result of the\n\nhearing[.]”). Defendant argues, however, that Plaintiff is not entitled to the entirety of the\n\nrequested fees because she “was denied the majority of the relief that she sought.” Id. Defendant\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fcontends that Plaintiff prevailed on only one issue—the appropriateness of the IEP—and was\n\n“denied the most significant portions of relief that she requested including immediate funding and\n\nplacement for the student at an appropriate program proposed by Parent, with transportation and\n\nall related services, as well as compensatory education consisting of social skills training and\n\nacademic tutoring.” Id. at 12. Plaintiff counters that she “was the prevailing party and found to\n\nbe entitled to specified special education services that DCPS had failed or refused to provide.”\n\nPl.’s Mot. 2. Plaintiff further argues that she “was successful on the core issue in the case. Success\n\nwas achieved because the additional testing was ordered and a new IEP reflecting this had to be\n\ndeveloped.” Pl’s Reply to Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. and Opp’n to Def.’s Cross-\n\nMot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 12 at 5 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply].\n\n         The court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff prevailed only in part but finds that\n\nPlaintiff’s success was nonetheless significant. In Hensley v. Eckerhart, the Supreme Court\n\nestablished a two-step inquiry to determine the attorneys’ fees to be awarded to a partially\n\nsuccessful plaintiff, emphasizing that the district court has substantial discretion in awarding such\n\nfees. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (“We reemphasize that the district court has discretion in\n\ndetermining the amount of a fee award.”);2 Goos v. Nat’l Ass’n of Realtors, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610879\"><a href=\"/opinion/610879/62-fair-emplpraccas-bna-585-302-usappdc-363-julie-goos-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1571\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (“These equitable judgments are left to the discretion of the district court.”) (citing\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37); Nelson v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362 (D.D.C.\n\n2013) (stating that “the first Hensley prong opens the door wide for discretion short of abuse”).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Although Hensley involved fee-shifting under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the Court explicitly noted that the “standards set\nforth in [its] opinion are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a\n‘prevailing party.’” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 n.7. Courts in this circuit have consistently applied the two-step Hensley\ninquiry in IDEA cases. See, e.g., A.S., 842 F. Supp. 2d at 46-47; B.R. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2150768\"><a href=\"/opinion/2150768/br-ex-rel-rempson-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n163-65 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n                                                           8\n\f               2. First Hensley inquiry\n\n       The first inquiry under Hensley directs courts to consider whether “the plaintiff fail[ed] to\n\nprevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n434. If a court determines that an unsuccessful claim is not related to a successful claim, it “must\n\nconfine fee awards to work done on the successful claims” by “weeding out work done on\n\nunrelated unsuccessful claims from any award.” George Hyman Const. Co. v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583563\"><a href=\"/opinion/583563/the-george-hyman-construction-company-v-james-e-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1535 (D.C. Cir. 1992). If, however, “the plaintiff’s claims for relief . . . involve a common\n\ncore of facts or [are] based on related legal theories” and “[m]uch of counsel’s time [is] devoted\n\ngenerally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-\n\nby-claim basis,” courts should move to the second Hensley inquiry without reducing the fees\n\nsought by a plaintiff. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. Claims need not have a “complete factual overlap”\n\nin order to be related. Goos, 997 F.2d at 1570.\n\n       In this case, the three issues addressed by the hearing officer shared a common core of facts\n\nand were premised on similar legal theories—the development and issuance of the Initial IEP and\n\nthe inadequacy of the Initial IEP—and were therefore related. The first issue focused on the\n\nsubstance of the Initial IEP, asking whether it, as a whole, was appropriate. HOD at 8. The second\n\nissue concerned the propriety of E.A.’s school placement, which the hearing officer declared\n\ndepended on the appropriateness of the Initial IEP. See id. at 9 (“[T]he appropriateness of a\n\nstudent’s assigned location of services turns on whether the location can implement an appropriate\n\nIEP for a given student[.]”). And the third issue, which focused on the process of developing the\n\nInitial IEP, i.e., whether DCPS sufficiently considered E.A.’s independent evaluations, also clearly\n\nshared that same common core of facts. It is thus difficult to segregate the hours expended by\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fPlaintiff’s counsel on the successful claims from the unsuccessful claims. The court will not\n\nreduce the attorney’s fees sought under the first Hensley inquiry.\n\n               3. Second Hensley inquiry\n\n        The second inquiry under Hensley requires a court to analyze the “degree of success\n\nobtained” by a plaintiff. 461 U.S. at 436. “Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his\n\nattorney should recover a full compensatory fee.” Id. at 435. Where “a plaintiff has achieved only\n\npartial or limited success . . . [t]he district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should\n\nbe eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.” Id. at 436-\n\n37. “There is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations”; rather, the second\n\ninquiry under Hensley is an “equitable judgment” in which a “court necessarily has discretion.”\n\nId. at 437.\n\n        Here, the court finds that Plaintiff obtained a high degree of success for E.A., though not\n\nthe “excellent results” that would warrant the full, undiminished award sought by Plaintiff. The\n\nadministrative hearing addressed three related issues. Plaintiff sought a variety of different\n\nremedies. But at bottom, Plaintiff initiated the IDEA administrative hearing contending that DCPS\n\nhad denied E.A. a FAPE and seeking to remedy that denial through additional testing and the\n\nrevision of his IEP. The hearing officer determined that E.A. was, in fact, denied a FAPE and\n\nordered DCPS to revise E.A.’s IEP as appropriate. DCPS revised the IEP by, among other\n\nadjustments, increasing the Occupational Therapy, Speech-Language Pathology, and Behavioral\n\nSupport Services to be provided to E.A. These revisions demonstrate the inadequacy of the Initial\n\nIEP and Plaintiff’s success as to the core of its litigation effort—improving E.A.’s IEP. Because\n\nPlaintiff achieved important improvements in E.A.’s IEP, the court does not believe it would be\n\nfair to award her 50 percent or less of her counsel’s fees, as Defendant urges.\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f       But Plaintiff fell short on two important fronts—a specialized school placement for E.A.\n\nand a diagnosis of autism, which presumably would have brought with it additional services. She\n\nalso did not prevail on her claim that DCPS inadequately considered E.A.’s independent\n\nevaluations. A reduction of 35 percent, in the court’s view, fairly reflects Plaintiff’s overall success\n\non E.A.’s behalf while recognizing the aspects of relief on which she did not prevail.\n\n       B. Reasonable Hourly Rate\n\n       The parties dispute the hourly rate on which to base the fee award. Plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the hourly rate sought. In re North, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699193\"><a href=\"/opinion/699193/in-re-oliver-l-north-bush-fee-application/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n189 (D.C. Cir. 1995). She must support her proposed hourly rate with evidence “that the requested\n\nrates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar lawyers of reasonably\n\ncomparable skill, experience, and reputation.” Blum v. Stenson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 895 n. 11 (1984).\n\nSuch an hourly rate “is normally deemed to be reasonable, and is referred to—for convenience—\n\nas the prevailing market rate.” Id.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the prevailing hourly market rate in IDEA cases is $510 for attorneys\n\nwith her counsel’s years of experience and $145 for experienced paralegals. Pl.’s Mot. at 5-6.\n\nPlaintiff derived these rates from the Laffey Matrix. See id. at 6-9; see Laffey Matrix (2003-2014),\n\nECF No. 9-10. The Laffey Matrix is a fee schedule maintained by the Civil Division of the United\n\nStates Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, “which sets out compensable billing rates\n\nfor attorneys in the District of Columbia and has been adopted by the judges of this District in\n\nmany cases.” Bucher v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477637/bucher-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (D.D.C. 2011) (citation\n\nomitted). Plaintiff asserts that, because of her counsel’s “extensive legal experience,” which\n\nconsists of “over 30 years” of practicing law, Pl.’s Mot. at 7, and the “complex” nature of the\n\nhearing at issue, see id. at 2-5, the full Laffey rates are appropriate. Defendant counters that,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fbecause E.A.’s administrative proceeding “was not novel or complex,” the court should reduce the\n\nLaffey rate by 25 percent. Def.’s Mot. at 11.\n\n       Although some courts in this district have applied a diminished Laffey rate in IDEA cases,\n\nsee, e.g., Rooths v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152-55 (D.D.C. 2007), this court sees no reason to do so here.\n\nPlaintiff’s counsel has extensive experience practicing law in the District of Columbia and, in\n\nparticular, litigating IDEA cases. See Decl. of Elizabeth T. Jester, Esq., ECF No. 9-2, ¶ 6 (“I have\n\nparticipated in hundreds of administrative due process hearings pursuant to IDEA and procured\n\ncountless settlement agreements in IDEA cases in the District of Columbia.”). Her paralegal has\n\nworked with Plaintiff’s counsel for 19 years. Id. ¶ 14. And this case was not, as the District\n\ncontends, uncomplicated. The administrative hearing at issue, which lasted for two days, involved\n\ntestimony from nine witnesses—including five experts—and 22 exhibits—including various\n\nevaluations of E.A. Pl.’s Mot. at 3. The administrative hearing was preceded by a “lengthy\n\nprehearing conference.” Id. Additionally, counsel’s preparation for the hearing occurred over five\n\nmonths, and she expended additional time over three different months to prepare for the post-\n\nhearing IEP meeting. See Invoice, ECF No. 9-6. Courts in this district “ha[ve] rejected the\n\nsuggestion that IDEA administrative litigation is categorically less complex than other forms of\n\nlitigation” and “reaffirm[ed] that IDEA cases are sufficiently complex to allow application of the\n\nLaffey Matrix.” Irving v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (D.D.C. 2011); see\n\nalso Jackson, 696 F. Supp. 2d at 102 (applying the Laffey Matrix and stating that “numerous judges\n\nin this district have applied Laffey rates in the context of fee awards arising out of IDEA\n\nadministrative proceedings”) (citations omitted); Young v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">125</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130-31 (D.D.C. 2012) (noting that courts in this district have not had “a unified approach to\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fthe proper rates for attorneys’ fees in IDEA cases” and “exercis[ing] . . . discretion to apply the\n\nrates that plaintiffs requested, which are equal to the Laffey Matrix rates”). The court applies the\n\nfull Laffey rates here.\n\n        C. Reduction of Specific Fees and Costs\n\n        Defendant requests (1) a reduction of fees for specific tasks undertaken by Plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel, namely, (a) travel to hearings and meetings in the District of Columbia and (b) drafting\n\nthe due process complaint, and (2) a reduction of certain administrative costs. The court finds a\n\n50 percent reduction of fees for travel to be appropriate, but will not reduce the fees incurred for\n\ndrafting the IDEA complaint or the administrative costs.\n\n                1. Reduction of Fees\n\n                          a. Travel\n\n        Defendant asserts, and Plaintiff does not contest, that $5,433.46 of the fees and costs sought\n\nare attributable to travel by Plaintiff’s counsel. See Def.’s Mot. at 14; see also Invoice at 6, 8, 9.\n\n“In this circuit, travel time generally is compensated at no more than half the attorney’s appropriate\n\nhourly rate.” Blackman v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515306\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515306/blackman-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (D.D.C. 2005) (citation\n\nomitted). Plaintiff concedes that a 50 percent rate reduction is proper for travel time. Pl.’s Reply\n\nat 7 (“[U]ndersigned counsel is willing to accept as reasonable in this case Defendant’s proposal\n\nthat compensation or travel time be at 50 percent of her hourly rate.”). This court therefore will\n\nreduce the fees Plaintiff seeks for travel by 50 percent after applying the 35 percent reduction,\n\nwhich is applicable to all fees requested.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                           b. Due process complaint\n\n         Defendant asserts that the 7.4 hours spent by Plaintiff’s counsel to draft and finalize the\n\n“Due Process Complaint Notice” was unreasonable.3 Invoice at 5. Defendant argues that “[t]he\n\namount billed to draft this Complaint was excessive and should be reduced accordingly; it is highly\n\nunlikely that it took nearly almost an entire business day to draft what is mostly a form complaint,\n\nand in any event, is only three pages in length.” Def.’s Mot. at 15. In support of its assertion,\n\nDefendant cites a single case in which a court reduced by 50 percent the fees requested for 10.5\n\nhours “to review both parties’ disclosures and prepare for the due process hearing.” Id. The court\n\nfinds it reasonable that counsel would have spent a business day drafting and refining what would\n\nserve as the framework pleading for the administrative hearing. The court therefore declines to\n\nreduce the attorneys’ fees sought for drafting the complaint.\n\n                  2. Reduction of administrative costs\n\n         Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s counsel “billed an excessive amount for faxing and\n\nphotocopying costs” and asks the court to limit reimbursement for such costs to $113.10. Id. The\n\ncourt finds that these costs, which Plaintiff’s counsel has repeatedly “averred . . . are accurate,”\n\nPl.’s Reply at 11, are reasonable. The court will not further reduce Plaintiff’s reimbursement for\n\nsuch costs; it will, however, reduce such costs by 35 percent, in line with the reduction made to\n\nthe award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  In its Reply brief, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s time entries of “2.7 hours reviewing records, 2 hours in ‘phone\nconsults’ and 2.4 hours of ‘correspondence,’” are also attributable to Plaintiff’s drafting of the due process complaint.\nDef.’s Reply to Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 14 at 5. “Taken together, that is 14.5 hours\ntoward writing, again, what amounts to a three-page due process complaint. Accordingly, the entire 14.5 hours should\nbe reduced by 50% because the number of hours billed are excessive and unreasonable.” Id. The court’s unchanged\nby Defendant’s amended argument.\n\n\n                                                          14\n\f V.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff’s and\n\nDefendant’s respective Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff is awarded $32,934.71\n\nin attorneys’ fees and costs under the IDEA. A separate Order accompanies this memorandum\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f</pre>",
