S 3604, The Fair Housing Council of Suburban\nPhiladelphia (\"FHC\") appeals an order of the district court\ngranting a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\nfiled by Acme Newspapers, Inc. (\"Acme\"), its publication,\nThe Main Line Times, and the paper's publisher. The district\ncourt granted this motion based on its conclusion that the\nFHC lacked standing under Article III of the United States\nConstitution to maintain this suit. Because we agree that\nthe FHC failed to establish any \"perceptible impairment\" to\nits operation caused by the alleged discrimination and thus\nfailed to satisfy the minimum standing requirements\n\n                               3\n\fembodied in Article III, we will affirm the order of the\ndistrict court.\n\nI.\n\nThe FHC, a fair housing group which has operated in the\nPhiladelphia area for more than forty years, describes itself\nas a non-profit organization whose \"purpose is to educate\nand promote fair housing and to oppose segregation based\non the protected classes found in the Fair Housing Act of\n1968, as amended.\"\n\nOn February 21, 1996, the FHC filed eleven lawsuits in\nfederal court, nine of which charged various newspaper\npublishers and related defendants with violations of the\nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. S 3604.1 In this suit, the FHC\nsought damages for injuries alleged to have been caused by\nreal estate advertisements placed in the Main Line Times on\na number of occasions during 1994 and 1995. In its\ncomplaint, the FHC alleged that:\n\n       On or about December, 1994 through at least\n       November, 1995, defendants approved and published\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) of the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful:\n\n       To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or\n       published any notice, statement, or advertisement with respect to\n       the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference,\n       limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,\n       handicap, familial status, or national origin or an intention to\nmake\n       any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.\n\nThe Act provides that \"an aggrieved person may commence a civil action\nin an appropriate United States district court . . ..\", S 3613(a)(1)(4),\nand\ndefines an \"aggrieved person\" (including corporations and associations)\nas:\n\n       Any person who--\n\n       (1) claims to have been injured by a discriminator y housing\n       practice; or\n\n       (2) believes that such person will be injured by a     discriminatory\n       housing practice that is about to occur.\n\nSection 3602(I).\n\n                               4\n\f       real estate advertisements that stated \"no children,\"\n       \"three persons,\" as well as, upon information and\n       belief, many other advertisements which indicated a\n       preference or limitation on the basis of familial status.\n\nThe case was tried before a jury in December, 1996. At\nthat time, five advertisements were at issue. These\nadvertisements contained the following allegedly\ndiscriminatory phrases 1) \"no children;\" 2) \"3 persons;\"\n3) \"ideal for couple or professional single;\" 4) \"(for one\nperson);\" and 5) \"(for one person).\" At t he close of all the\nevidence, Acme and the other defendants filed a motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.\nAcme contended that the FHC had failed to establish injury\nsufficient to satisfy the standing requirement imposed by\nArticle III of the United States Constitution. The district\ncourt deferred ruling on this motion and submitted the case\nto the jury.\n\nOn December 4, 1996, the jury returned a verdict in\nfavor of the FHC, awarding the FHC $25,000 in\ncompensatory damages. On December 17, 1996, Acme\nrenewed its Rule 50 motion, again arguing that the FHC\nlacked standing to pursue its claims under the Fair\nHousing Act. The district court granted this renewed\nmotion on January 28, 1997, stating that it had\"acted\nprematurely in submitting the case to the jury as[the FHC]\ndid not have standing to bring any of the claims asserted in\nits Complaint.\" Fair Housing Council of Suburban\nPhiladelphia v. Main Line Times, No. 96-1379, 1997 WL\n30642 at *6 (E.D. Pa. Jan 27, 1997). This timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\nII.\n\nThis appeal requires that we revisit, albeit in a different\ncontext, the identical issue raised in Fair Housing Council of\nSuburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, No.\n97-1051 (3d Cir. March 31, 1998): whether the FHC has\nshown \"distinct and palpable\" injury sufficient to satisfy\nArticle III standing requirements under the Fair Housing\nAct. Resolution of this question turns on the application of\nconstitutional standing requirements. We reviewed the\n\n                               5\n\fparameters of these requirements at length in our opinion\nin Montgomery Newspapers, and will not repeat that\ndiscussion here.\n\nWe begin our examination of the issue before us by\nnoting that Article III principles governing standing are by\nnow well-settled. In Lujan v. Defenders of Wild Life, 540\nU.S. 555, 560, the Supreme Court summarized the law of\nstanding as follows:\n\n       Over the years, our cases have established that the\n       irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n       contains three elements. First the plaintiff must have\n       suffered an \"injury in fact\" -- an invasion of a legally\n       protected interest which is a) concrete and\n       particularized, and b) \"actual or imminent, not\n       `conjectural' or `hypothetical.' \" Second, there must be\n       a causal connection between the injury and the\n       conduct complained of -- the injury has to be\"fairly\n       . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\n       defendant and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent\n       action of some third party not before the court.\" Third,\n       it must be \"likely\" as opposed to merely \"speculative,\"\n       that the injury will be \"redressed by a favorable\n       decision.\"\n\n(Citations omitted.) These requirements -- particularly the\nneed for injury in fact -- were applied in the fair housing\ncontext in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363,\n378-79 (1982). There, the Supreme Court wrote that:\n\n       In determining whether [a fair housing organization]\n       has standing under the Fair Housing Act, we conduct\n       the same inquiry as in the case of an individual: Has\n       the plaintiff \" `alleged such a personal stake in the\n       outcome of the controversy' as to warrant his\n       invocation of federal court jurisdiction\"? . . . If, as\n       broadly alleged, petitioner's practices have perceptibly\n       impaired [the organization]'s ability to provide\n       counseling and referral services for low- and moderate-\n       income homeseekers, there can be no question that the\n       organization has suffered injury in fact. Such concrete\n       and demonstrable injury to the organization's activities\n       -- with the consequent drain on the organization's\n\n                               6\n\f       resources -- constitutes far more than simply a\n       setback to the organization's abstract social interests.\n\n455 U.S. at 378-79 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nThe caselaw establishes that in order to defeat the motion\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the FHC was\nrequired to submit \"evidence showing through specific facts\n. . . that . . . it [was] `directly' affected [by the alleged\ndiscrimination].\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wild Life, 540 U.S.\nat 562 (emphasis added). \"Since [the elements of standing]\nare not mere pleading requirements but rather an\nindispensable part of the plaintiff's case, each element must\nbe supported in the same way as any other matter on\nwhich the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e. with the\nmanner and degree of evidence required at the successive\nstages of the litigation.\" Id. at 561. Despite the jury verdict\nin the FHC's favor, the district court concluded that the\nFHC failed to meet its burden of proof, producing nothing\nof substance at trial to support the damage allegations set\nforth in the complaint.2 There was no \"evidence upon which\nthe jury could properly find a verdict for [the FHC].\"\nLightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d\nCir. 1993).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The complaint contains the following allegations bearing on injury:\n\n       9. [E]ach act of discrimination conducted in the Delaware Valley\n       causes a setback to the good work accomplished by the FHC's\n       educational and outreach efforts and to the development of an\n       integrated housing community. As a result, the FHC must launch\n       further efforts to undo the damage that the discrimination has\n       caused. In the case of widespread and broadly disseminated\n       discrimination, such as occurs in the ongoing publication of a\n       landlord's discriminatory advertisements, the further efforts\nrequired\n       are a substantial drain on its resources and harms[sic] the FHC.\n\n       18. As a result of the conduct of the Defendants, persons were\n       injured in their person and property. Specifically, families with\n       children were barred from housing in violation of the Fair Housing\n       Act of 1968 as amended. Further, the FHC is now forced to divert\n       funds to counteract the discriminatory message and acts of\n       Defendants, and has had its purpose frustrated by Defendants'\n       discriminatory conduct.\n\nThese damage allegations are identical to those set forth in the complaint\nfiled in Fair Housing Council v. Montgomery Newspapers.\n\n                               7\n\fJudgment as a matter of law is to be granted sparingly.\nWe will affirm an order granting judgment as a matter of\nlaw \"only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair\nand reasonable inference . . . it is apparent that the verdict\nis not supported by legally sufficient evidence.\" Id. We have\ncarefully reviewed the FHC's damage allegations and the\nevidence introduced to support them and are convinced\nthat this is one of those rare cases where, following a jury\nverdict, judgment as a matter of law was warranted.\n\nIII.\n\nThe FHC alleges that it suffered impairment sufficient to\nestablish Article III standing when it was forced to divert\nresources from counseling and other activities to: (1) an\ninvestigation designed to determine the existence and\nextent of on-going discrimination in advertising;\n(2) litigation; and (3) an educational campaign designed to\ncounteract the discriminatory effect of the advertisements.\nWe considered and rejected identical damage claims based\non the need to divert funds to investigation and litigation in\nMontgomery Newspapers. As the \"proof\" offered on these\nissues is virtually identical to that offered and found\nlacking in Montgomery Newspapers, we need not detail that\nproof or repeat our analysis here.\n\nBecause, however, the evidence regarding the need for an\neducational campaign to counteract the alleged\ndiscrimination differs somewhat from that offered in\nMontgomery Newspapers, we address it briefly. At trial, the\nFHC's Executive Director sought to establish that the FHC\nhad suffered injury sufficient to satisfy Article III by offering\nthe following testimony:\n\n       For [forty years, the FHC] educates. We go out to all\n       kinds of organizations, groups . . . and educate them\n       about their rights to obtain housing on a non-\n       discriminatory basis. We also spend a tremendous\n       amount of time educating the industry. . . . So, when\n       these ads appear in the paper and even if it's only one\n       ad, it sort of undoes -- not sort of, it definitely undoes\n       all that good work, all that hard work, all that\n\n                               8\n\f       education. Its back to where we started from. It's as\n       though we never did this. It's broadcast to tens of\n       thousands of people. First of all, people see it and\n       think that they could be turned down for housing.\n       Other Realtors, landlords, see this, think either the\n       laws don't exist or they're not enforced. We havefiled\n       complaints against people and they've come to us with\n       dozens of ads from the newspaper that say, look, here's\n       ads that say not children, no children, adults only,\n       adults preferred, perfect for single. And they say, well,\n       what's wrong? This is in the newspaper.\n\n       Q. Are you talking about people you've charged?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Okay.\n\n       A. -- people that we have filed complaints against.\n\n       Q. Like who?\n\n       A. Individual landlords . . . . So our job is to educate.\n       And all this education goes down the drain when\n       these ads appear in the paper.\n\nWhile we can agree intuitively that continued publication\nof discriminatory advertising in general could have an\nadverse effect on public perception, thus making the job of\nthe FHC more difficult, we are convinced that even were we\nto assume injury, the evidence submitted failed to establish\nthe necessary \"causal connection between the injury and\nthe [particular advertisements].\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wild\nLife, 540 U.S. at 560.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the FHC did not show that the\nadvertisements at issue created any adverse effects upon\nfamilies seeking housing or upon public perception of the\nadvertisements' legality. The evidence offered was probative\nonly as to the effect of discriminatory advertising generally\non landlords and realtors. The testimony offered by the\nFHC with respect to the five specific advertisements failed\nto establish that they had been read by anyone outside the\nFHC or that the FHC was required to modify its operation\nin any way as a result of these advertisements.3 As Acme\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The dissent states that activities \"falling between investigation and\nthe\nfiling of a lawsuit can constitute Article III injury . . . .\" (Slip\nOpinion at\n\f9\n\fcorrectly observes, \"No injury to the cause of fair housing --\nor consequent impairment of the Council's programs --\ncould follow from the publication of advertising which was\nonly proven to have been observed by persons who knew\nthat it was illegal, i.e. the Council's staff members.\"\n\nIV.\n\nFaced with the difficulties inherent in its evidence, the\nFHC takes the position that, because it holds the status of\na private attorney general, it need show nothing more than\na violation of the Act in order to establish Article III\nstanding. We disagree. The fact that a housing organization\nis able to show that a particular advertisement violates the\nAct is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III;\na violation of the Act does not automatically confer standing\non any plaintiff, even one who holds the status of a private\nattorney general. An organization acting as a private\nattorney general is relieved only of prudential limitations on\nstanding and may bring suit to enforce the rights of others\nonly where the organization itself is able to demonstrate that\nit has suffered injury in fact. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572-73\n(requiring that an organization holding status of private\nattorney general show injury in fact). The required\ndemonstration of legally cognizable injury is absent in this\ncase. Although we have given serious consideration to the\njury's verdict and award of compensatory damages in favor\nof the FHC, our analysis of the record compels us,\nnonetheless, to conclude that the record is devoid of\n\"evidence upon which the jury could properly [have found\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15). The dissent concludes that the FHC suffered such an injury when\nit devoted resources to holding a press conference \"to publicize the\nnewspaper's violation of the Fair Housing Act.\" Id. The testimony of an\nFHC representative establishes that this \"press conference was held to\nannounce the filing of [eleven] lawsuits . .. so that we could get the\nmessage out . . . that the type of ads that appear in the Main Lines\nTimes . . . are in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\" We have not found\nany case which has held that a press conference announcing the filing\nof lawsuits might be sufficient to establish Article III injury. To adopt\nthis\nradical view of injury would effectively nullify the Article III standing\nrequirement.\n\n                               10\n\fa] verdict for [the FHC].\" Lightning Lube, Inc., 4 F.3d at\n1166.\n\nV.\n\nIn concluding that the strictures of Article III bar the FHC\nfrom maintaining this suit, we emphasize here, as we did in\nMontgomery Newspapers, that the goal of \"eliminating\ndiscrimination in housing is vitally important.\" (Slip\nOpinion at 18.) Even this laudable objective does not,\nhowever, warrant an evisceration of Article III. As Acme\npoints out:\n\n       [T]he most impassioned public policy arguments\n       cannot eliminate the case or controversy requirement\n       from the Constitution. If anything, the appeal to public\n       policy should highlight . . . the separation of powers\n       rationale from which the case or controversy doctrine\n       flows. Adjudicating actual controversies, not legislating\n       social policy, is the province of the judiciary.\n\nOur adherence to the requirements of Article III should\nnot impede vigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act.\nThe caselaw is replete with examples of housing\norganizations which have successfully established injury\nsufficient to carry them over the Article III threshold. As we\nobserved in Montgomery Newspapers, \"It should not be\ninsurmountably difficult for these organizations to establish\nstanding either in their own right or on behalf of their\nmembers by referring to well-established standing\nprinciples and adjusting their pleadings and proof\naccordingly.\" (Slip Opinion at 18.)\n\nVI.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the\ndistrict court.\n\n                                11\n\fNYGAARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting\n\nThis appeal raises the identical issue presented in Fair\nHousing Council of Suburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery\nNewspapers, No. 97-1051 (3d Cir. 1998). Again, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\nThe FHC has standing to sue The Main Line Times under\n42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) because it has shown the threshold\ninjury that is required under Article III, Section 2 of the\nConstitution. At trial the FHC demonstrated that it must\nredirect resources to an educational campaign to inform\nlandlords, real estate agents, housing providers, and\nconsumers that discrimination based on family status\nviolates 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c). The FHC held a press\nconference to advise, among others, housing providers and\nconsumers that the advertisements in The Main Line Times\nviolated the Fair Housing Act. The FHC further\ndemonstrated the ignorance of housing providers, who\ncontinue to attempt to submit illegal advertisements, and\nthe need for an educational campaign for the housing\nindustry and for the defendant itself, who continued to\npublish illegal advertisements and to promote\nmisunderstanding about the familial status provisions of\nthe Fair Housing Act. The majority mistakenly concludes\nthat the FHC has not demonstrated the need for an\neducational campaign. In support of its holding, the\nmajority repeats its characterization of the FHC's evidence\nfrom the Montgomery Newspapers case. As I concluded in\nMontgomery Newspapers, the majority's depiction of the\nevidence is incorrect. The district court concluded that the\nadvertisements were not the cause of any programmatic\nchanges the FHC may have made. Again, I disagree; the\nFHC is only required to show that its injury is fairly\ntraceable to the actions of the defendant. Furthermore, the\nFHC has demonstrated standing for costs incurred\ninvestigating and applying legal pressure to The Main Line\nTimes. The majority does not discuss this as it pertains to\nthe evidence submitted in this case; but because it relies on\nits conclusion in the Montgomery Newspapers case, I\nreiterate my disagreement with that conclusion here.\n\n                               12\n\fI. Standard of Review\n\nThis is an exceptional case in which the district court\ngranted judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict\nof $25,000 in favor of the FHC. Generally, courts grant\njudgment as a matter of law sparingly, and give the\nnonmoving party every fair and reasonable inference before\nconcluding that the verdict was not supported by legally\nsufficient evidence. Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp.,4\nF.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). The majority misapplies\nthis standard, and credits only one passage of testimony in\nsupport of the FHC's position. We have held that a case is\nproperly submitted to a jury unless it is \"critically deficient\nof that minimum quantum of evidence from which the jury\nmight reasonably afford relief.\" Link v. Mercedes-Benz of N.\nAm., Inc., 788 F.2d 918, 921 (3d Cir. 1986). A review of the\nrecord plainly reveals sufficient evidence to support a\nverdict in favor of the FHC.\n\nII. Educational Injury\n\nThe Supreme Court held in Havens Realty Corp. v.\nColeman, 455 U.S. 363, 372, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 1121 (1982),\nthat the plaintiff organization had standing to sue if the\nactivity that allegedly violated the Fair Housing Act\nperceptibly impaired counseling and referral services. This\nimpairment meets the \"injury in fact\" test because a\nconcrete and demonstrable drain on resources is a more\nplausible injury than a conjectural \"setback\" to an\norganization's abstract social interests. Id. at 379\n(distinguishing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92\nS. Ct. 1361 (1972)). The courts of appeals interpreting\nHavens agree that diversion of resources to educational\nprograms is sufficient to impart Article III standing. See,\ne.g., Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v.\nBMC Mktg. Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1276-77 (D.C. Cir. 1994);\nHousing Opportunities Made Equal, Inc. v. Cincinnati\nEnquirer, Inc., 943 F.2d 644 (6th Cir. 1991); Spann v.\nColonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990). An\n\"identifiable trifle\" of this type of injury will suffice to confer\nstanding upon the FHC, even when the proceedings have\nadvanced to trial. United States v. Students Challenging\nRegulatory Agency Procedures, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14, 93\n\n                               13\n\fS. Ct. 2405, 2417 n.14 (1973) (rejecting the argument that\nstanding should be limited to those significantly injured,\nand ruling that any level of injury is sufficient to confer\nstanding). The FHC has clearly met its burden by showing\nsufficient evidence of injury.\n\nThe FHC held a press conference to inform consumers\nand the housing industry that the discriminatory\nadvertisements that appeared in The Main Line Times\nviolated the Fair Housing Act. Jan Chadwick, Assistant\nDirector of the FHC, testified to the detailed plan to educate\nhousing providers and consumers about the Fair Housing\nAct's family status provisions, and explained a specific\nproposal for newspaper campaign. The FHC also presented\nevidence of the additional costs associated with the\nnewspaper campaign.\n\nThe FHC has also shown that its educational plan is a\nnecessary response to the discriminatory advertisements\nthat appeared in The Main Line Times because individuals\nseeking to place advertisements, as well as those\nresponsible for publishing the ads, misunderstood the\nfamily status provisions of the Fair Housing Act. The illegal\nadvertisements at issue in this lawsuit were accepted into\npublication by the trained staff of The Main Line Times\nadvertising department. Frequently, individuals placing\nhousing advertisements insisted on illegal wording, telling\nnewspaper staff members to \"take it or leave it,\" and the\npaper would sometimes have to reject ads because the\nindividual placing it refused to comply with the Fair\nHousing Act. The FHC educational plan, and specifically\nthe press conference the FHC already held, attempted to\ndispel misconceptions about the Fair Housing Act that\nhousing providers might have developed from reading the\nillegal advertisements in The Main Line Times.\n\nIII. Investigation Injury\n\nTime spent reviewing the newspaper for illegal housing\nadvertisements can constitute Article III injury. Havens\nfound \"injury in fact\" when a fair housing organization had\nto divert resources to \"identify and counteract\"\ndiscriminatory practices. 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S. Ct. at\n\n                               14\n\f1124. Like \"educational injury,\" the courts following\nHavens agree that costs incurred investigating violations of\nthe Fair Housing Act can confer standing. See, e.g., Hooker\nv. Weathers, 990 F.2d 913, 915 (6th Cir. 1993) (costs\nincurred in the investigation to confirm the facts and\ncircumstances).\n\nViewing the evidence of the two alternative Article III\nfactors, investigation and litigation injury, there is at least\na minimum quantum of evidence required to show injury.\nHere, the FHC demonstrated that it diverted resources to\nreview The Main Line Times to identify violations of the Fair\nHousing Act.\n\nIV. Litigation Injury\n\nI restate my conclusion from my dissent in Montgomery\nNewspapers that activities falling between investigation and\nthe filing of the lawsuit can constitute Article III injury to\nan organization under Havens. My decision to confer\nstanding upon fair housing organizations for enforcement\nactivities, other than the filing of the lawsuit, does not\nconflict with the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's\ncases that the majority finds persuasive. Those cases only\nprohibit conferral of standing for the act of filing the\nlawsuit. See Fair Employment Council of Greater\nWashington, Inc. v. BMC Marketing Corp., 28 F.3d 1268\n(D.C. Cir. 1994); Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24\n(D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\nThe FHC testified to the activities it had to postpone\nwhen it dedicated resources to enforcement activities\narising from The Main Line Times advertisements. (Direct of\nJames Berry, J.A. at 208-209.) The FHC chose non-\nlitigation methods to apply legal pressure upon The Main\nLine Times to enforce the Fair Housing Act, including filing\na complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Resources\nCommission (J.A. at 855) and holding a press conference to\npublicize the newspaper's violations of the Fair Housing\nAct.\n\nV. Causation\n\nThe district court held, and the majority agrees, that the\nFHC could not show that the alleged injury was caused by\n\n                                15\n\fany illegal advertisements published by the Main Line\nTimes. I disagree. For standing purposes, a plaintiff is\nrequired to show that its injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the\ndefendant's actions. Public Interest Research Group of New\nJersey, Inc. v. Powell Duffryn, 913 F.2d 64, 71 (3d Cir.\n1990). Tort causation is not required by Article III, and a\nplaintiff, even at the trial stage, does not have to prove\ninjury for standing purposes with scientific certainty. Id. at\n73 n. 10.\n\nThe FHC was able to specifically connect the\nadvertisements at issue in this lawsuit to the press\nconference. Likewise, the FHC was able to associate its\ninvestigation and litigation injuries to the specific\nadvertisements that were the ultimate subject of the\nlawsuit.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, including the reasons set\nforth in my Montgomery Newspapers dissent, I conclude\nthat the FHC has standing to advance a claim under 42\nU.S.C. S 3604(c). I would reverse the district court and\nreinstate the $25,000 verdict in favor of the FHC and\nagainst The Main Line Times.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               16\n\f",

S 3604, The Fair Housing Council of Suburban\nPhiladelphia (\"FHC\") appeals an order of the district court\ngranting a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\nfiled by Acme Newspapers, Inc. (\"Acme\"), its publication,\nThe Main Line Times, and the paper's publisher. The district\ncourt granted this motion based on its conclusion that the\nFHC lacked standing under Article III of the United States\nConstitution to maintain this suit. Because we agree that\nthe FHC failed to establish any \"perceptible impairment\" to\nits operation caused by the alleged discrimination and thus\nfailed to satisfy the minimum standing requirements\n\n                               3\n\fembodied in Article III, we will affirm the order of the\ndistrict court.\n\nI.\n\nThe FHC, a fair housing group which has operated in the\nPhiladelphia area for more than forty years, describes itself\nas a non-profit organization whose \"purpose is to educate\nand promote fair housing and to oppose segregation based\non the protected classes found in the Fair Housing Act of\n1968, as amended.\"\n\nOn February 21, 1996, the FHC filed eleven lawsuits in\nfederal court, nine of which charged various newspaper\npublishers and related defendants with violations of the\nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. S 3604.1 In this suit, the FHC\nsought damages for injuries alleged to have been caused by\nreal estate advertisements placed in the Main Line Times on\na number of occasions during 1994 and 1995. In its\ncomplaint, the FHC alleged that:\n\n       On or about December, 1994 through at least\n       November, 1995, defendants approved and published\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) of the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful:\n\n       To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or\n       published any notice, statement, or advertisement with respect to\n       the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference,\n       limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,\n       handicap, familial status, or national origin or an intention to\nmake\n       any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.\n\nThe Act provides that \"an aggrieved person may commence a civil action\nin an appropriate United States district court . . ..\", S 3613(a)(1)(4),\nand\ndefines an \"aggrieved person\" (including corporations and associations)\nas:\n\n       Any person who--\n\n       (1) claims to have been injured by a discriminator y housing\n       practice; or\n\n       (2) believes that such person will be injured by a     discriminatory\n       housing practice that is about to occur.\n\nSection 3602(I).\n\n                               4\n\f       real estate advertisements that stated \"no children,\"\n       \"three persons,\" as well as, upon information and\n       belief, many other advertisements which indicated a\n       preference or limitation on the basis of familial status.\n\nThe case was tried before a jury in December, 1996. At\nthat time, five advertisements were at issue. These\nadvertisements contained the following allegedly\ndiscriminatory phrases 1) \"no children;\" 2) \"3 persons;\"\n3) \"ideal for couple or professional single;\" 4) \"(for one\nperson);\" and 5) \"(for one person).\" At t he close of all the\nevidence, Acme and the other defendants filed a motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.\nAcme contended that the FHC had failed to establish injury\nsufficient to satisfy the standing requirement imposed by\nArticle III of the United States Constitution. The district\ncourt deferred ruling on this motion and submitted the case\nto the jury.\n\nOn December 4, 1996, the jury returned a verdict in\nfavor of the FHC, awarding the FHC $25,000 in\ncompensatory damages. On December 17, 1996, Acme\nrenewed its Rule 50 motion, again arguing that the FHC\nlacked standing to pursue its claims under the Fair\nHousing Act. The district court granted this renewed\nmotion on January 28, 1997, stating that it had\"acted\nprematurely in submitting the case to the jury as[the FHC]\ndid not have standing to bring any of the claims asserted in\nits Complaint.\" Fair Housing Council of Suburban\nPhiladelphia v. Main Line Times, No. 96-1379, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">30642</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *6 (E.D. Pa. Jan 27, 1997). This timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\nII.\n\nThis appeal requires that we revisit, albeit in a different\ncontext, the identical issue raised in Fair Housing Council of\nSuburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, No.\n97-1051 (3d Cir. March 31, 1998): whether the FHC has\nshown \"distinct and palpable\" injury sufficient to satisfy\nArticle III standing requirements under the Fair Housing\nAct. Resolution of this question turns on the application of\nconstitutional standing requirements. We reviewed the\n\n                               5\n\fparameters of these requirements at length in our opinion\nin Montgomery Newspapers, and will not repeat that\ndiscussion here.\n\nWe begin our examination of the issue before us by\nnoting that Article III principles governing standing are by\nnow well-settled. In Lujan v. Defenders of Wild Life, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560, the Supreme Court summarized the law of\nstanding as follows:\n\n       Over the years, our cases have established that the\n       irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n       contains three elements. First the plaintiff must have\n       suffered an \"injury in fact\" -- an invasion of a legally\n       protected interest which is a) concrete and\n       particularized, and b) \"actual or imminent, not\n       `conjectural' or `hypothetical.' \" Second, there must be\n       a causal connection between the injury and the\n       conduct complained of -- the injury has to be\"fairly\n       . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\n       defendant and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent\n       action of some third party not before the court.\" Third,\n       it must be \"likely\" as opposed to merely \"speculative,\"\n       that the injury will be \"redressed by a favorable\n       decision.\"\n\n(Citations omitted.) These requirements -- particularly the\nneed for injury in fact -- were applied in the fair housing\ncontext in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110654\"><a href=\"/opinion/110654/havens-realty-corp-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n378-79 (1982). There, the Supreme Court wrote that:\n\n       In determining whether [a fair housing organization]\n       has standing under the Fair Housing Act, we conduct\n       the same inquiry as in the case of an individual: Has\n       the plaintiff \" `alleged such a personal stake in the\n       outcome of the controversy' as to warrant his\n       invocation of federal court jurisdiction\"? . . . If, as\n       broadly alleged, petitioner's practices have perceptibly\n       impaired [the organization]'s ability to provide\n       counseling and referral services for low- and moderate-\n       income homeseekers, there can be no question that the\n       organization has suffered injury in fact. Such concrete\n       and demonstrable injury to the organization's activities\n       -- with the consequent drain on the organization's\n\n                               6\n\f       resources -- constitutes far more than simply a\n       setback to the organization's abstract social interests.\n\n455 U.S. at 378-79 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nThe caselaw establishes that in order to defeat the motion\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the FHC was\nrequired to submit \"evidence showing through specific facts\n. . . that . . . it [was] `directly' affected [by the alleged\ndiscrimination].\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wild Life, 540 U.S.\nat 562 (emphasis added). \"Since [the elements of standing]\nare not mere pleading requirements but rather an\nindispensable part of the plaintiff's case, each element must\nbe supported in the same way as any other matter on\nwhich the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e. with the\nmanner and degree of evidence required at the successive\nstages of the litigation.\" Id. at 561. Despite the jury verdict\nin the FHC's favor, the district court concluded that the\nFHC failed to meet its burden of proof, producing nothing\nof substance at trial to support the damage allegations set\nforth in the complaint.2 There was no \"evidence upon which\nthe jury could properly find a verdict for [the FHC].\"\nLightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652883\"><a href=\"/opinion/652883/lightning-lube-inc-laser-lube-a-new-jersey-corporation-v-witco/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1166 (3d\nCir. 1993).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The complaint contains the following allegations bearing on injury:\n\n       9. [E]ach act of discrimination conducted in the Delaware Valley\n       causes a setback to the good work accomplished by the FHC's\n       educational and outreach efforts and to the development of an\n       integrated housing community. As a result, the FHC must launch\n       further efforts to undo the damage that the discrimination has\n       caused. In the case of widespread and broadly disseminated\n       discrimination, such as occurs in the ongoing publication of a\n       landlord's discriminatory advertisements, the further efforts\nrequired\n       are a substantial drain on its resources and harms[sic] the FHC.\n\n       18. As a result of the conduct of the Defendants, persons were\n       injured in their person and property. Specifically, families with\n       children were barred from housing in violation of the Fair Housing\n       Act of 1968 as amended. Further, the FHC is now forced to divert\n       funds to counteract the discriminatory message and acts of\n       Defendants, and has had its purpose frustrated by Defendants'\n       discriminatory conduct.\n\nThese damage allegations are identical to those set forth in the complaint\nfiled in Fair Housing Council v. Montgomery Newspapers.\n\n                               7\n\fJudgment as a matter of law is to be granted sparingly.\nWe will affirm an order granting judgment as a matter of\nlaw \"only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair\nand reasonable inference . . . it is apparent that the verdict\nis not supported by legally sufficient evidence.\" Id. We have\ncarefully reviewed the FHC's damage allegations and the\nevidence introduced to support them and are convinced\nthat this is one of those rare cases where, following a jury\nverdict, judgment as a matter of law was warranted.\n\nIII.\n\nThe FHC alleges that it suffered impairment sufficient to\nestablish Article III standing when it was forced to divert\nresources from counseling and other activities to: (1) an\ninvestigation designed to determine the existence and\nextent of on-going discrimination in advertising;\n(2) litigation; and (3) an educational campaign designed to\ncounteract the discriminatory effect of the advertisements.\nWe considered and rejected identical damage claims based\non the need to divert funds to investigation and litigation in\nMontgomery Newspapers. As the \"proof\" offered on these\nissues is virtually identical to that offered and found\nlacking in Montgomery Newspapers, we need not detail that\nproof or repeat our analysis here.\n\nBecause, however, the evidence regarding the need for an\neducational campaign to counteract the alleged\ndiscrimination differs somewhat from that offered in\nMontgomery Newspapers, we address it briefly. At trial, the\nFHC's Executive Director sought to establish that the FHC\nhad suffered injury sufficient to satisfy Article III by offering\nthe following testimony:\n\n       For [forty years, the FHC] educates. We go out to all\n       kinds of organizations, groups . . . and educate them\n       about their rights to obtain housing on a non-\n       discriminatory basis. We also spend a tremendous\n       amount of time educating the industry. . . . So, when\n       these ads appear in the paper and even if it's only one\n       ad, it sort of undoes -- not sort of, it definitely undoes\n       all that good work, all that hard work, all that\n\n                               8\n\f       education. Its back to where we started from. It's as\n       though we never did this. It's broadcast to tens of\n       thousands of people. First of all, people see it and\n       think that they could be turned down for housing.\n       Other Realtors, landlords, see this, think either the\n       laws don't exist or they're not enforced. We havefiled\n       complaints against people and they've come to us with\n       dozens of ads from the newspaper that say, look, here's\n       ads that say not children, no children, adults only,\n       adults preferred, perfect for single. And they say, well,\n       what's wrong? This is in the newspaper.\n\n       Q. Are you talking about people you've charged?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Okay.\n\n       A. -- people that we have filed complaints against.\n\n       Q. Like who?\n\n       A. Individual landlords . . . . So our job is to educate.\n       And all this education goes down the drain when\n       these ads appear in the paper.\n\nWhile we can agree intuitively that continued publication\nof discriminatory advertising in general could have an\nadverse effect on public perception, thus making the job of\nthe FHC more difficult, we are convinced that even were we\nto assume injury, the evidence submitted failed to establish\nthe necessary \"causal connection between the injury and\nthe [particular advertisements].\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wild\nLife, 540 U.S. at 560.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the FHC did not show that the\nadvertisements at issue created any adverse effects upon\nfamilies seeking housing or upon public perception of the\nadvertisements' legality. The evidence offered was probative\nonly as to the effect of discriminatory advertising generally\non landlords and realtors. The testimony offered by the\nFHC with respect to the five specific advertisements failed\nto establish that they had been read by anyone outside the\nFHC or that the FHC was required to modify its operation\nin any way as a result of these advertisements.3 As Acme\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The dissent states that activities \"falling between investigation and\nthe\nfiling of a lawsuit can constitute Article III injury . . . .\" (Slip\nOpinion at\n\f9\n\fcorrectly observes, \"No injury to the cause of fair housing --\nor consequent impairment of the Council's programs --\ncould follow from the publication of advertising which was\nonly proven to have been observed by persons who knew\nthat it was illegal, i.e. the Council's staff members.\"\n\nIV.\n\nFaced with the difficulties inherent in its evidence, the\nFHC takes the position that, because it holds the status of\na private attorney general, it need show nothing more than\na violation of the Act in order to establish Article III\nstanding. We disagree. The fact that a housing organization\nis able to show that a particular advertisement violates the\nAct is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III;\na violation of the Act does not automatically confer standing\non any plaintiff, even one who holds the status of a private\nattorney general. An organization acting as a private\nattorney general is relieved only of prudential limitations on\nstanding and may bring suit to enforce the rights of others\nonly where the organization itself is able to demonstrate that\nit has suffered injury in fact. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572-73\n(requiring that an organization holding status of private\nattorney general show injury in fact). The required\ndemonstration of legally cognizable injury is absent in this\ncase. Although we have given serious consideration to the\njury's verdict and award of compensatory damages in favor\nof the FHC, our analysis of the record compels us,\nnonetheless, to conclude that the record is devoid of\n\"evidence upon which the jury could properly [have found\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15). The dissent concludes that the FHC suffered such an injury when\nit devoted resources to holding a press conference \"to publicize the\nnewspaper's violation of the Fair Housing Act.\" Id. The testimony of an\nFHC representative establishes that this \"press conference was held to\nannounce the filing of [eleven] lawsuits . .. so that we could get the\nmessage out . . . that the type of ads that appear in the Main Lines\nTimes . . . are in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\" We have not found\nany case which has held that a press conference announcing the filing\nof lawsuits might be sufficient to establish Article III injury. To adopt\nthis\nradical view of injury would effectively nullify the Article III standing\nrequirement.\n\n                               10\n\fa] verdict for [the FHC].\" Lightning Lube, Inc., 4 F.3d at\n1166.\n\nV.\n\nIn concluding that the strictures of Article III bar the FHC\nfrom maintaining this suit, we emphasize here, as we did in\nMontgomery Newspapers, that the goal of \"eliminating\ndiscrimination in housing is vitally important.\" (Slip\nOpinion at 18.) Even this laudable objective does not,\nhowever, warrant an evisceration of Article III. As Acme\npoints out:\n\n       [T]he most impassioned public policy arguments\n       cannot eliminate the case or controversy requirement\n       from the Constitution. If anything, the appeal to public\n       policy should highlight . . . the separation of powers\n       rationale from which the case or controversy doctrine\n       flows. Adjudicating actual controversies, not legislating\n       social policy, is the province of the judiciary.\n\nOur adherence to the requirements of Article III should\nnot impede vigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act.\nThe caselaw is replete with examples of housing\norganizations which have successfully established injury\nsufficient to carry them over the Article III threshold. As we\nobserved in Montgomery Newspapers, \"It should not be\ninsurmountably difficult for these organizations to establish\nstanding either in their own right or on behalf of their\nmembers by referring to well-established standing\nprinciples and adjusting their pleadings and proof\naccordingly.\" (Slip Opinion at 18.)\n\nVI.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the\ndistrict court.\n\n                                11\n\fNYGAARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting\n\nThis appeal raises the identical issue presented in Fair\nHousing Council of Suburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery\nNewspapers, No. 97-1051 (3d Cir. 1998). Again, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\nThe FHC has standing to sue The Main Line Times under\n42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) because it has shown the threshold\ninjury that is required under Article III, Section 2 of the\nConstitution. At trial the FHC demonstrated that it must\nredirect resources to an educational campaign to inform\nlandlords, real estate agents, housing providers, and\nconsumers that discrimination based on family status\nviolates 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c). The FHC held a press\nconference to advise, among others, housing providers and\nconsumers that the advertisements in The Main Line Times\nviolated the Fair Housing Act. The FHC further\ndemonstrated the ignorance of housing providers, who\ncontinue to attempt to submit illegal advertisements, and\nthe need for an educational campaign for the housing\nindustry and for the defendant itself, who continued to\npublish illegal advertisements and to promote\nmisunderstanding about the familial status provisions of\nthe Fair Housing Act. The majority mistakenly concludes\nthat the FHC has not demonstrated the need for an\neducational campaign. In support of its holding, the\nmajority repeats its characterization of the FHC's evidence\nfrom the Montgomery Newspapers case. As I concluded in\nMontgomery Newspapers, the majority's depiction of the\nevidence is incorrect. The district court concluded that the\nadvertisements were not the cause of any programmatic\nchanges the FHC may have made. Again, I disagree; the\nFHC is only required to show that its injury is fairly\ntraceable to the actions of the defendant. Furthermore, the\nFHC has demonstrated standing for costs incurred\ninvestigating and applying legal pressure to The Main Line\nTimes. The majority does not discuss this as it pertains to\nthe evidence submitted in this case; but because it relies on\nits conclusion in the Montgomery Newspapers case, I\nreiterate my disagreement with that conclusion here.\n\n                               12\n\fI. Standard of Review\n\nThis is an exceptional case in which the district court\ngranted judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict\nof $25,000 in favor of the FHC. Generally, courts grant\njudgment as a matter of law sparingly, and give the\nnonmoving party every fair and reasonable inference before\nconcluding that the verdict was not supported by legally\nsufficient evidence.

Witco Corp.,</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652883\"><a href=\"/opinion/652883/lightning-lube-inc-laser-lube-a-new-jersey-corporation-v-witco/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). The majority misapplies\nthis standard, and credits only one passage of testimony in\nsupport of the FHC's position. We have held that a case is\nproperly submitted to a jury unless it is \"critically deficient\nof that minimum quantum of evidence from which the jury\nmight reasonably afford relief.\" Link v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2417 n.14 (1973) (rejecting the argument that\nstanding should be limited to those significantly injured,\nand ruling that any level of injury is sufficient to confer\nstanding). The FHC has clearly met its burden by showing\nsufficient evidence of injury.\n\nThe FHC held a press conference to inform consumers\nand the housing industry that the discriminatory\nadvertisements that appeared in The Main Line Times\nviolated the Fair Housing Act. Jan Chadwick, Assistant\nDirector of the FHC, testified to the detailed plan to educate\nhousing providers and consumers about the Fair Housing\nAct's family status provisions, and explained a specific\nproposal for newspaper campaign. The FHC also presented\nevidence of the additional costs associated with the\nnewspaper campaign.\n\nThe FHC has also shown that its educational plan is a\nnecessary response to the discriminatory advertisements\nthat appeared in The Main Line Times because individuals\nseeking to place advertisements, as well as those\nresponsible for publishing the ads, misunderstood the\nfamily status provisions of the Fair Housing Act. The illegal\nadvertisements at issue in this lawsuit were accepted into\npublication by the trained staff of The Main Line Times\nadvertising department. Frequently, individuals placing\nhousing advertisements insisted on illegal wording, telling\nnewspaper staff members to \"take it or leave it,\" and the\npaper would sometimes have to reject ads because the\nindividual placing it refused to comply with the Fair\nHousing Act. The FHC educational plan, and specifically\nthe press conference the FHC already held, attempted to\ndispel misconceptions about the Fair Housing Act that\nhousing providers might have developed from reading the\nillegal advertisements in The Main Line Times.\n\nIII. Investigation Injury\n\nTime spent reviewing the newspaper for illegal housing\nadvertisements can constitute Article III injury. Havens\nfound \"injury in fact\" when a fair housing organization had\nto divert resources to \"identify and counteract\"\ndiscriminatory practices. 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S. Ct. at\n\n                               14\n\f1124. Like \"educational injury,\" the courts following\nHavens agree that costs incurred investigating violations of\nthe Fair Housing Act can confer standing. See, e.g., Hooker\nv. Weathers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604160\"><a href=\"/opinion/604160/sandra-hooker-richard-hooker-and-fair-housing-contact-service-v-terry/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 915 (6th Cir. 1993) (costs\nincurred in the investigation to confirm the facts and\ncircumstances).\n\nViewing the evidence of the two alternative Article III\nfactors, investigation and litigation injury, there is at least\na minimum quantum of evidence required to show injury.\nHere, the FHC demonstrated that it diverted resources to\nreview The Main Line Times to identify violations of the Fair\nHousing Act.\n\nIV. Litigation Injury\n\nI restate my conclusion from my dissent in Montgomery\nNewspapers that activities falling between investigation and\nthe filing of the lawsuit can constitute Article III injury to\nan organization under Havens. My decision to confer\nstanding upon fair housing organizations for enforcement\nactivities, other than the filing of the lawsuit, does not\nconflict with the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's\ncases that the majority finds persuasive. Those cases only\nprohibit conferral of standing for the act of filing the\nlawsuit. See Fair Employment Council of Greater\nWashington, Inc. v. BMC Marketing Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673802\"><a href=\"/opinion/673802/fair-employment-council-of-greater-washington-inc-v-bmc-marketing/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.C.

Colonial Village, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538783\"><a href=\"/opinion/538783/girardeau-a-spann-v-colonial-village-inc-girardeau-a-spann-v-marvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\nThe FHC testified to the activities it had to postpone\nwhen it dedicated resources to enforcement activities\narising from The Main Line Times advertisements. (Direct of\nJames Berry, J.A. at 208-209.) The FHC chose non-\nlitigation methods to apply legal pressure upon The Main\nLine Times to enforce the Fair Housing Act, including filing\na complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Resources\nCommission (J.A. at 855) and holding a press conference to\npublicize the newspaper's violations of the Fair Housing\nAct.\n\nV. Causation\n\nThe district court held, and the majority agrees, that the\nFHC could not show that the alleged injury was caused by\n\n                                15\n\fany illegal advertisements published by the Main Line\nTimes. I disagree. For standing purposes, a plaintiff is\nrequired to show that its injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the\ndefendant's actions. Public Interest Research Group of New\nJersey, Inc. v. Powell Duffryn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547478\"><a href=\"/opinion/547478/public-interest-research-group-of-new-jersey-inc-and-friends-of-the-earth/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (3d Cir.\n1990). Tort causation is not required by Article III, and a\nplaintiff, even at the trial stage, does not have to prove\ninjury for standing purposes with scientific certainty. Id. at\n73 n. 10.\n\nThe FHC was able to specifically connect the\nadvertisements at issue in this lawsuit to the press\nconference. Likewise, the FHC was able to associate its\ninvestigation and litigation injuries to the specific\nadvertisements that were the ultimate subject of the\nlawsuit.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, including the reasons set\nforth in my Montgomery Newspapers dissent, I conclude\nthat the FHC has standing to advance a claim under 42\nU.S.C. S 3604(c). I would reverse the district court and\nreinstate the $25,000 verdict in favor of the FHC and\nagainst The Main Line Times.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               16\n\f</pre>",
