FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution evidence\n     On October 29, 1998, at about 11:00 p.m., a Black couple, Edward Robinson\nand his girlfriend Renesha Ann Fuller, were shot and killed outside Robinson‘s\ntownhouse at 254th Street and Frampton Avenue in Harbor City. Robinson‘s\nsister heard the shots, looked out her second-story window, and saw a big, older\nmodel car with horizontal tail lights driving away. Four shell casings were found\nat the scene. An autopsy revealed that Robinson was shot three or four times.\nFuller was shot twice, but one of the bullets may have first traveled through\nRobinson.\n     Ernie Vasquez, who was in the area that night, testified that even though few\ncars were on the road the night of October 29, 1998, on several occasions during a\nperiod of 15 to 20 minutes he saw an older Buick Regal or similar model sedan,\nburgundy or dull red in color, driving near the area of the murders. The car, which\ncontained three or four people Vasquez did not know, had horizontal tail lights.\nVasquez later identified Juan Carlos Caballero as the driver. (Caballero was\nmurdered shortly after the murders in this case.) Persons resembling defendant\nSatele (also known as ―Wilbone‖) and defendant Nunez (also known as ―Speedy‖)\nwere, respectively, in the front passenger seat and backseat of the vehicle. After\nabout 11:00 p.m., while Vasquez was parked in a hotel driveway, he heard shots,\nducked down, and then drove away. After driving for about a minute, he saw a\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fbody lying in the road, and stopped to assist the victim, who he later learned was\nRobinson.\n     Around midnight that same night, about an hour after Robinson and Fuller\nwere murdered, Joshua Contreras met both defendants and Caballero at a\nneighborhood park. Defendants and Contreras were members of the West Side\nWilmas gang. Contreras heard defendant Satele say, ―We were out looking for\nniggers,‖ and heard Satele or Nunez say, ―I think we hit one of ‘em.‖\n     The next evening, Contreras was at a friend‘s house with several people,\nincluding both defendants. Satele appeared nervous, and told Contreras that the\nmurders of the ―Black guy and Black girl‖ that he had shot were ―in the news.‖\nSatele told Contreras ―he was driving right there in Harbor City and he saw a\nBlack guy or Black girl hugging or kissing or something and he just shot them.‖\n     Later that night around 3:40 a.m., Los Angeles Police Officers Adam\nGreenburg and Vinh Nguyen were in a marked police when they saw a car, later\nidentified as a four-door Chrysler, driving with its headlights off. The Chrysler\npulled over to the curb. As the officers pulled in front of the Chrysler and\nactivated their car‘s emergency lights, three occupants fled the Chrysler. (At trial,\nOfficer Greenburg identified defendant Nunez as the person who had been driving\nand defendant Satele as the person who had been seated in the front passenger\nseat.) The police pursued Satele and arrested him. On the Chrysler‘s driver‘s seat\nwas a white baseball cap with the word ―west‖ on the front and the name\n―Speedy‖ on the back. Between the driver‘s and passenger seats was a large\nsemiautomatic Norinco Mak-90, an AK-47-type assault rifle. The rifle was\nidentified as the murder weapon through ballistics testing. A magazine attached to\nthe weapon contained 26 live rounds of jacketed hollow-point cartridges; the\nmagazine was capable of carrying 30 rounds.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f     Joshua Contreras, who had joined the West Side Wilmas gang shortly before\nthe two murders, told police that both defendants were ―riders‖ — persons who\n―kill[ed] their enemies‖ — and that they had an AK-47 rifle they called\n―Monster.‖ Contreras saw defendant Satele put the AK-47 into the ―car that\nSpeedy [defendant Nunez] had‖ shortly before defendant Satele was arrested. (At\ntrial, Contreras denied or claimed not to remember his statements to police, and\nthose statements were introduced as prior inconsistent statements.)\n     On December 3, 1998, several weeks after the two murders, Ernie Vasquez\nand defendant Satele were in a cell in a Los Angeles County jail. When Satele\nheard that Vasquez was from Harbor City, he asked if Vasquez had heard about\nthe killings there. When Vasquez said, ―I think so, yes‖ or ―something . . . to that\nnature,‖ Satele said, ―Well, we did that,‖ or possibly ―I did that,‖ adding, ―I AK‘d\nthem,‖ or ―We AK‘d them.‖ Vasquez mentioned these statements to police\nofficers on January 6, 1999, after his fingerprint had been found on victim Fuller‘s\ncar. At Vasquez‘s request, he was then transferred to the Lynwood jail, which was\ncloser to his home.\n     On January 7, 1999, defendant Nunez, who was a trusty at Lynwood jail,\napproached Vasquez. Nunez asked if Vasquez was from Harbor City, and\nVasquez said, ―Yes.‖ Nunez said he had killed ―those niggers . . . in your\nneighborhood.‖ Nunez mentioned that he had been driving down the street when\none of the victims ―looked at him wrong,‖ so Nunez ―turned back around and\nblasted‖ the victim.\n     On February 9, 1999, Los Angeles Police Detective Robert Dinlocker\nshowed both defendants a photograph of the four-door Chrysler in which they\nwere seen on the night after the murders, and asked them if that car was used in\nthe homicide. Two days later, defendants were falsely told they were going to be\nbooked on murder charges; while being transported together to and from the\n\n                                          4\n\fcourthouse their conversations were recorded. Defendant Satele said: ―I not even\nreally sweating it dog, because all that shit that they got, that shit‘s wrong. . . . But\nif them mother fuckers would have shown me the car that we fuckin‘ actually did\nthat shit in, fuck, I‘d be stressing like a mother fucker.‖\n     At defendants‘ murder trial, Ruby Feliciano testified that she owned the four-\ndoor Chrysler in which defendants were seen on the night after the murders. A\nweek earlier, she had taken the car to defendant Nunez for repairs, and he had\npromised to return the car that evening. He did not do so, and a week later she\nsaw a woman driving her car. When she later told Nunez she was going to report\nher car as stolen, he threatened her life. After the car was impounded by police\nshortly after the two murders, Feliciano received a telephone call from Nunez‘s\ngirlfriend; Nunez, who was in jail, was also on the line. During this three-way\nconversation, Nunez asked Feliciano to change what she had told the detectives,\nand his girlfriend asked Feliciano to say that she had spoken to Nunez and his\ngirlfriend at a certain time on the night police recovered the car, and that Nunez\nhad been home at the time.\n     The prosecution presented evidence of defendant Nunez‘s animus against\nBlacks. Esther Collins, who is Black, testified that in September 1997, defendant\nNunez, who was intoxicated, came up to her in her garage, and calling her a\n―nigger,‖ asked for money or drugs. When Collins said she had none, Nunez\nagain called her a ―nigger‖ and spat on her. He then hit Collins in the mouth with\na hard object, fracturing her jaw, and said, ―[n]igger, get up nigger.‖ Collins‘s\nhusband, who is also Black, came out to the garage with a ―pop gun‖ in an effort\nto scare Nunez off. Nunez laughed at him, threw ―the word ‗nigger‘ around,‖ and\nleft. Collins, who was afraid of the West Side Wilmas gang (of which Nunez was\na member), did not report the incident to the police that day because she did not\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fwant trouble. When Collins later reported the assault, she did not mention that\nNunez was drunk.\n     At the time Collins testified against defendants, she was incarcerated. She\ntestified that on one occasion when she and defendant Nunez were on the bus from\njail to court, he said, ―Are you testifying? Don‘t testify. Something like that.‖\nNunez also asked, ―Where is your son? Is he in custody?‖ Collins denied she was\npersonally afraid to testify, but said she feared reprisal against her son, who was\nalso in prison, because ―[i]t‘s a black and racial thing in jail.‖ Los Angeles\nDistrict Attorney‘s Office Investigator John Neff testified he had spoken to Collins\nthe week before her testimony. Collins told him she was afraid to testify because,\nwhile on the transportation bus, ―one of the defendants had made a veiled threat by\nasking how her son was,‖ and then saying, ― ‗You‘re not going to testify, are\nyou?‘ ‖\n     The prosecution presented evidence that West Side Wilmas gang members\nother than defendants had committed crimes. Detective Dinlocker testified that\nRuben Figueroa and Brian Dominic Martinez were West Side Wilmas gang\nmembers, and the prosecution introduced records of Martinez‘s conviction for\nassault with a firearm and Figueroa‘s convictions for murder and assault with a\ndeadly weapon.\n     Los Angeles Police Officer Julie Rodriguez testified as an expert on the West\nSide Wilmas gang. She said the gang‘s primary activities are ―anything that‘s\ngoing to benefit the gang,‖ including narcotic sales and murder. ―Associates‖ of\nthe gang are younger boys who are ―trying to prove themselves,‖ and ―hang out\nwith the gang members,‖ but who ―aren‘t quite yet‖ gang members. The area of\nthe two murders was not claimed by the West Side Wilmas but by rival gangs.\nAccording to Rodriguez, murdering a Black couple with no gang ties would cause\ndefendants to ―move . . . up in the gang.‖ In her view, if defendants here murdered\n\n                                          6\n\fRobinson and Fuller (a Black couple with no gang ties), they did so with the\nspecific intent to promote, further or assist in the criminal activity of West Side\nWilmas.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Scott Chapman, who was assigned to the\ngang unit at the Men‘s Central Jail, testified that while rival gang members in the\nstreet will attack each other, ―[o]nce they come into county jail it becomes a race\nissue . . . [and] [t]hey bond together to protect themselves.‖ Hispanic gangs\nsometimes include persons who, like defendant Satele, are of Samoan descent.\n\n           2. Defense evidence\n\n               a. Defendant Nunez\n     Yolanda Guaca, defendant Nunez‘s girlfriend and the mother of his two\nchildren, testified that Nunez was at home with her from about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m.\non October 29, 1998 (the night of the murders), until the next morning. Guaca‘s\nmother Sandra Lopez gave similar testimony. Lopez, who lived with defendant\nNunez and Guaca, said that the only way in and out of their home was through the\nfront door. Because the front screen door was damaged, once everyone was home\nshe ordinarily tied a string to it in such a manner that the door could not be entered\nfrom the outside unless a person inside the house opened it. When she awoke on\nthe morning of October 30, the string had not been disturbed.\n     Defendant Nunez testified that he was born in National City and was 24\nyears old. Between the ages of 10 and 12 he stole bicycles for the West Side\nWilmas. When he was ―[m]aybe 12‖ years old he became a member of the gang\nand began selling rock cocaine and sometimes marijuana. Between the ages of 14\nand 20 he was incarcerated for auto theft and selling cocaine. While incarcerated\nhe and three other inmates assaulted two other Latino gang members.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f     After his release at age 20, defendant Nunez moved into the Norwalk home\nhis mother shared with her husband, defendant‘s younger sister, and his younger\nbrother. He worked in a warehouse for several months, but he had difficulty\ngetting a ride to work and did not know how to take the bus. He was accepted at\nCerritos College, but left the area before the semester began.\n     Defendant Nunez left his mother‘s home after two months because he did not\nwant to interfere with his mother‘s life. His father, who lived in San Diego, had\nnot helped in raising him, and he did not want to ask his father for anything. He\nreturned to Wilmington and to the West Side Wilmas gang because he ―didn‘t\nknow anything else‖ to do and did not want to ask for help. He lost his\nidentification documentation, which impeded the few efforts he made to find a job.\nHe started selling crack cocaine and methamphetamine. Between the time of his\nrelease at age 20 and his arrest in November 1998 shortly after the two murders\nhere, Nunez had three additional convictions, apparently for gun possession and\ndrug sales or possession. He said: ―Practically everything I did was against the\nlaw. I wasn‘t living right.‖\n     On the night of the two murders, Yolanda Guaca picked defendant Nunez up\nabout 9:00 p.m. They bought takeout food and went home, and defendant went to\nbed. He woke once during the night to speak with a visitor, went back to sleep,\nand then woke up again in the morning. On cross-examination, he conceded that\nhe sometimes left in the middle of the night without Yolanda‘s knowledge. He\ndenied meeting Joshua Contreras at a park a half-hour after the murders, and\ndenied that he had ever been a jail trusty.\n     Defendant Nunez said that Ruby Feliciano rented her car to him in exchange\nfor drugs. When he was arrested in November 1998 shortly after the two murders,\nhe thought he was being charged with stealing her car. He asked Yolanda to call\nFeliciano and ask her to tell the police ―the truth,‖ which was that he had not\n\n                                          8\n\fstolen her car. He ―sort of threatened‖ Feliciano, telling her that if she visited, she\nshould bring the money she owed him.\n     Defendant Nunez admitted assaulting Esther Collins. He said that he had\nbeen drunk and had hit Collins with a small, hard handball because she had not\npaid a debt. He had ―no excuse‖ for hitting her, but he denied that he hit her\nbecause she was Black.\n     On cross-examination, the prosecutor introduced defendant Nunez‘s\nstatements during a December 1998 interview with detectives. In the interview,\nNunez was asked if he had a history of ―hating Black people.‖ He replied, ―I don‘t\nhate them. I believe in segregation, but I mean, why would I go and shots [sic]\nany Black person, there is a lot of them in Wilmington.‖ He also said, ―I can‘t\nstand how they get loud. . . . I just believe in segregation. I don‘t like them [too]\nmuch by me, that‘s what I‘m saying. Why I would go all the way to Harbor City\nto just shoot a Black person?‖ The prosecutor played a segment of the February\n11, 1999, tape recording of both defendants‘ conversation in the jail van\ntransporting them to court (see pp. 4-5, ante), in which Nunez said he wanted ―no\nBlack people, woods straight woods.‖ After listening to this segment, Nunez\ntestified that the term ―woods‖ means ―White people.‖ He said he and defendant\nSatele did not discuss the murders in the van.\n     Jacqueline Oree testified that her 16-year-old twin sons, Jayson and Jonathan\nBrooks, who are Black, were friends with both defendants for about six years\nwhen Oree lived in Wilmington, and that defendant Nunez came over two or three\ntimes a week. Defendant Satele watched her house while she was on vacation,\nnever spoke derogatorily about Black persons or used the word ―nigger,‖ and\nnever harmed her sons physically or emotionally. Oree‘s two sons were involved\nwith the West Side Wilmas gang, an activity she did not approve of. Oree moved\nout of the West Side Wilmas‘s territory in August 1999.\n\n                                           9\n\f     Jayson Brooks, Oree‘s son, testified that he had known both defendants for\nabout three or four years, that all three of them were in the West Side Wilmas\ngang, and they spent their time doing recreational activities such as playing\nbasketball, swimming, and having barbecues.\n     Byron Wilson, who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death,\ntestified that he knew defendant Nunez in jail from September 1999 to April 2000.\nFor most of this period, defendant Nunez was a jail trusty. Wilson never heard\nhim use ―the N-word.‖\n     Vondrea Williams, who was in custody awaiting trial on charges of\naggravated mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon, testified that he had met\ndefendant Nunez in jail about eight or nine months earlier. Williams and Nunez\nwere jail trusties, and the two alternated shifts. Williams, a Black man, said that\nNunez showed no prejudice and treated Black inmates with respect.\n     Jesus Esparza, who was in jail while awaiting trial on an attempted murder\ncharge, testified that he had been in a cell next to Nunez‘s for several weeks. He\nnever heard Nunez refer to Blacks in disparaging terms, nor were there any\nincidents between Nunez and any Black inmate. On one occasion in December\n1999, when the cells were going to be searched, Esparza threw a four-foot-long\nhard object made from tightly wrapped paper out of his cell into the hall. The\nguards assumed the object belonged to defendant Nunez, even though Esparza\nclaimed it was his. Nunez stood silent, and was punished with 20 days in the\n―hole,‖ a place Esparza described as ―sort of‖ like solitary confinement.\n     David Butler, a firearms examiner, retired Los Angeles police officer, and\n―distinguished member‖ of the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners,\ntestified that the casings found at the murder scene bore marks consistent with\nhaving been fired from the gun found in the car in which defendants were riding\nthe night after the two murders. The magazine attached to this gun held 30\n\n                                         10\n\frounds. The bullets contained steel penetrators, and were originally designed to\npenetrate light armor on military vehicles. In Butler‘s view, the shooter was fairly\nstationary when the shooting occurred. He could not tell whether the shooter fired\nfrom inside a car, but if so, the car was stopped at the time of the gun‘s discharge.\n\n               b. Defendant Satele\n     Lawrence Kelly testified that he had been a member of the West Side\nWilmas for 12 to 13 years. The gang had between 30 to 40 active members. One\nway the gang made money was by selling narcotics; some gang members may also\nhave committed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, but the gang did not do\ndrive-by shootings. A gang member who testified against another gang member\nwould be ―beat up‖ or even killed.\n     At about midnight on the night of the murders (committed around\n11:00 p.m.), Kelly met defendant Satele at a park playground. Also present were\ndefendant Nunez, Joshua Contreras, and Juan Carlos Caballero. Kelly was at the\npark for ―a minute or two,‖ and then walked with defendant Satele to the nearby\nhome of Kelly‘s girlfriend. Contrary to what Contreras told the police, Kelly did\nnot hear defendant Satele say, ―We were out looking for niggers,‖ nor did he hear\neither defendant say, ―I think we got one.‖ At this time, Kelly owned a 1980\nbrown Buick Regal. (As previously mentioned, prosecution witness Ernie\nVasquez testified that on the night of the murders he saw an older Buick Regal or\nsimilar model sedan driving near the area of the murders, and that persons\nresembling Nunez and Satele were passengers in the car.)\n     Kelly identified exhibit No. 48, the murder weapon, as a gun to which\neveryone in the West Side Wilmas gang had access, adding that the gun was used\nto protect gang members engaged in drug transactions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f     Kelly had known defendant Satele for about two years and had never heard\ndefendant Satele ―use the ‗N‘ word‖ or display disrespect for Black persons.\n     Kelly knew Joshua Contreras (a prosecution witness), and saw him nearly\nevery day during 1998, the year of the two murders here. On most occasions,\nContreras was under the influence of crystal methamphetamine and ―[v]ery\nparanoid.‖ Kelly explained: ―He would think people were after him or what not\nor saying things. His mind was just playing tricks on him and stuff.‖\n     Richard Satele, defendant Satele‘s father, testified that his son had never\nexhibited racial bias and had been taught to ―respect all races and all people.‖\n     Darnell Demery, the husband of defendant Satele‘s cousin, testified that he\nhad never heard Satele say anything derogatory about Blacks or ―use the ‗N‘\nword,‖ nor had he seen Satele being verbally or physically aggressive. Satele did\nnot have a bad temper and got ―along with everybody.‖ Demery was not aware\nthat Satele was involved with the West Side Wilmas gang.\n     Willy Guillory, a teacher at defendant Satele‘s high school and a longtime\nfamily friend, testified that Satele caused no problems at school, had never\nreferred to Black persons as ―niggers,‖ and had never behaved ―against any racial\ncomponent in our society.‖\n     The parties stipulated that, if called to testify, Los Angeles Police Officer\nSimmons would testify that she had interviewed murder victim Edward\nRobinson‘s sister on October 29, 1998, at the scene of the shooting, and that her\nreport stated that the sister had said: ―We were all inside my apartment playing\ncards, it was time for [murder victim Fuller] to go home. My brother walked her\noutside to her car. I went outside on my patio that overlooked the street, to ask my\nbrother if he locked the front door. . . . Before I had a chance to ask him anything,\nI heard about seven shots or more. Then I saw a small gray-colored car driving\ndown the street.‖\n\n                                         12\n\f     Dr. Lewis Yablonski, a gang expert, testified that to familiarize himself with\nthe West Side Wilmas gang, he had interviewed four members – defendant Satele,\nLawrence Kelly, and Jayson and Jonathan Brooks. Dr. Yablonski was of the view\nthat defendant Satele had no ―special hostility towards Black people.‖\n     According to Dr. Yablonski: ―[W]hen a gang member is in jail, there is an\nissue of survival. Consequently, he may . . . brag a lot to indicate he‘s bad.‖\nPeople in custody, Dr. Yablonski said, brag about crimes they did not commit to\ngain a reputation. If defendant Satele, while in jail, told a rival gang member of\nHispanic descent, ―We did a shooting,‖ this would mean he was trying to impress\nthe other person with the fact that his gang was tough and violent, and to warn the\nother person to leave him alone. The word ―we‖ in this context would not\nnecessarily mean the person making the statement was involved in the crime, but\nrather would refer to the gang‘s activity, much as one might say of one‘s\nbasketball team, ―We beat Indianapolis.‖ If an inmate was bragging about\nsomething he personally did, he would be more likely to say ―I‖ than ―we,‖ but if\none inmate said ―we‖ committed a double murder, and another inmate said ―I‖\ncommitted the same murder, the pronoun used would not necessarily be significant\nin ascertaining who committed the crime.\n\n           3. Rebuttal evidence\n     Glenn Phillips testified that in November 1999, defense witness Lawrence\nKelly visited Phillips‘s home in Redondo Beach, where Kelly spoke to Warren\nBattle, who was Black and worked for Phillips. Kelly asked if Battle would like to\n―make a hundred bucks to do a job for him.‖ Battle replied, ―Yes, of course‖ and\nKelly then said he needed Battle ―to testify we get along with Black people.‖\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Larry Arias testified that on November\n9, 1999, he was escorting a Black inmate named Keys in the Men‘s Central Jail.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fKeys, who was ―waist chained‖ and could not raise his hands to his face, was\npunched in the face by defendant Satele and fell to the ground. Keys had not\nprovoked the attack.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff John Kepley testified that on December\n2, 1999, he conducted a random search of a module in the Men‘s Central Jail.\nEach cell housed one inmate. While standing in front of cell 14, he saw an inmate\nin cell 16 walk up to the gate, look down the row, and throw the ―shaft‖ of a\n―spear‖ into the area in front of the cell. Jail records showed that defendant Nunez\nwas assigned to cell 16. Kepley did not recall any inmate claiming responsibility\nfor throwing out the object.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase\n\n           1. Prosecution evidence\n     The prosecution presented victim impact testimony and evidence of\ndefendant Nunez‘s jail misconduct.\n     Testifying about 21-year-old murder victim Renesha Ann Fuller were\nRoberta Hollis (Renesha‘s mother) and Simon Hollis (Renesha‘s stepfather).\n(Because each victim has the same surname as several of the penalty phase\nwitnesses, we refer to the victims and witnesses by their first names in this portion\nof the opinion.) Roberta provided transportation to persons with AIDS, and Simon\nwas an Inglewood police officer. Roberta described Renesha as quiet, sweet, and\ninnocent: a ―mother‘s . . . dream in a child.‖ After Renesha‘s murder, Roberta\nmissed six months of work.\n     Roberta and Simon testified that Renesha did well in school, and had just\nstarted her first year of college when she was killed. She worked as a teacher‘s\naide at a school for students who had ―dropped out of school and had hard times.‖\nAfter the murder, Renesha‘s students started a college scholarship in her name.\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f     Testifying about 22-year-old murder victim Edward Robinson were Leandrea\nFields-Robinson (Edward‘s stepmother), Albert Robinson (Edward‘s father), Rosa\nRobinson Morris (Edward‘s sister), and Renesha Robinson (Edward‘s niece).\nLeandrea, a former teacher and counselor, was an administrator for the Los\nAngeles Unified School District. Albert was in the construction industry, and\nspecialized in installing tennis courts. After Edward‘s mother died in childbirth,\nLeandrea raised Edward from the time he was three months old.\n     Murder victim Edward was close to his father, and Leandrea said the two\nwould talk for hours ―about being a man and doing the right thing.‖ Edward\nattended Harbor City College, and worked part-time for his father to help pay for\nschool. Edward led a prayer group at church, was the church drummer, and was\nthe kind of person ―that any mother or father would love to have to call their son.‖\nHis father recalled that ―a lot of young people his age . . . said because of him they\nturned their lives around and started going to church and studying the Bible.‖\nEdward was taught to respect women, and it was reflective of his character that he\nwas walking Renesha to her car on the night they were murdered.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Randall Shickler testified that on August\n17, 1999, he and another deputy transported defendant Nunez from court back to\njail. Nunez was in the front section of the bus with about 12 other inmates, and\none of his hands was handcuffed to a chain. Shickler heard a ratcheting sound and\nsaw that Nunez, no longer handcuffed, was standing over another inmate. He\nrefused orders to recuff, laughed, and began doing jumping jacks to demonstrate to\nShickler that he was free. After the bus reached the jail, when other deputies who\nhad been called out to assist were visible from inside the bus, Nunez put his\nhandcuffs back on. The officers determined that the handcuffs of about 10\ninmates on the bus had been altered.\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Lisa Estes testified that on one occasion\nin the middle of trial she searched defendant Nunez after he arrived from jail and\nbefore he appeared in court. She found a razor blade in a Bible Nunez was\ncarrying.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Ronald Baltierra testified that on May 8,\n2000, he saw another deputy search defendant Nunez before a court appearance.\nIn Nunez‘s mouth, the deputy found a heavy-duty staple, which in Baltierra‘s\nopinion could be used to unlock handcuffs.\n\n            2. Defense evidence\n\n               a. Defendant Nunez\n     Jorge Flores, defendant Nunez‘s father, testified that he and Betty Nunez,\ndefendant Nunez‘s mother, lived together while she was pregnant with defendant\nNunez. After he was born they continued to see each other for a couple of years.\nJorge had seen defendant Nunez about ―seven times.‖ He did not counsel and\nguide him as he was growing up. The last time he had seen defendant Nunez was\nin 1980 or 1981, when Jorge borrowed a car from the family and never returned it.\nAfter about 1984, when he married, he was under the impression that Betty did not\nwant her family to give him any information about defendant Nunez‘s location,\nand wanted Jorge to stay away from him. He regretted not being there for\ndefendant Nunez and guiding him.\n     Antonio Nunez, defendant Nunez‘s uncle, testified that Betty Nunez was his\nhalf sister. Their mother had a drinking problem. Antonio was 13 or 14 years old\nand Betty was about 18 years old when defendant Nunez was born. At the time,\nBetty was homeless and stayed with various relatives and friends, including\nAntonio‘s family; she was inexperienced at caring for an infant. Her resources\nwere extremely limited, and often when Betty was at Antonio‘s home there was no\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\ffood or clean diapers for defendant Nunez. Betty was an emotionally distant\nmother.\n     About a year after defendant Nunez was born, Antonio left school to support\nthe family. He eventually bought a house in Wilmington, and Nunez (who was\neight or nine years old) and Betty lived with him. Antonio worked long hours, and\nBetty worked at night, so Nunez was left unsupervised. Nunez was excited when\nhe did well in Little League, and Antonio regretted not going to more of his games\nor understanding its importance to him. Nunez was jealous of Antonio‘s wife\nwhen Antonio got married. When Nunez was between 12 and 14 years old, the\npolice raided Antonio‘s house looking for gang members. As a result, Antonio\nbecame concerned for his family‘s safety and asked Betty and Nunez to move out.\n     Yolanda Guaca, defendant Nunez‘s girlfriend and the mother of his two\nyoung sons, said she loved him and did not want to see him executed.\n     Dr. Saul Niedorf, a psychiatrist and pediatrician, testified that he had\ninterviewed defendant Nunez, and had also spoken with his mother, his uncle\nAntonio, two of his aunts, and Yolanda Guaca. He had reviewed Antonio Nunez‘s\ntrial testimony and at least some of defendant Nunez‘s records from the former\nCalifornia Youth Authority. He did not administer any tests, but he considered it\nlikely that defendant Nunez could read at a high school level.\n     Dr. Niedorf noted defendant Nunez‘s lack of bonding with his mother, and\nsaid defendant‘s uncle Antonio was his first consistent bond. As a result of\nAntonio‘s influence, Nunez was later a tender and caring father. When Nunez was\nabout 10 or 11, he lost this consistent attachment because Antonio became\ninvested in married life. Nunez looked for teenage boys to be attached to, and\nfound this attachment in gang members. In Dr. Niedorf‘s view, defendant was\ncompulsive and obsessive, and methodically and loyally worked at his ―job‖ of\nselling drugs. He participated in a work program while incarcerated as a teenager,\n\n                                         17\n\fand Dr. Niedorf noted that there are work programs in the California prison\nsystem.\n       In Dr. Niedorf‘s opinion, defendant Nunez was ―relatively free of explosive\nirrational behavior[],‖ and thought before he did things unless he was provoked.\nDr. Niedorf viewed his acts of misconduct in jail as acts of defiance that\ndeveloped his self-esteem. They were not based on a desire to escape, although\nthat desire was there, nor were they explosive or aggressive. He agreed, however,\nwith the prosecutor that such misconduct ―can create an explosive situation,‖ and\nthat ―going to a rival gang territory with a loaded assault rifle . . . with armor-\npiercing bullets and driving around in that area and looking to kill someone‖ was\naggressive. In Dr. Niedorf‘s view, defendant Nunez ―believe[d] he did not kill‖\nand ―grieve[d] that there were victims in this crime, who, as he would put it, were\ninnocent.‖\n\n                b. Defendant Satele\n       Testifying on defendant Satele‘s behalf were his parents, Richard and Esther\nSatele. Richard was 26 years old and Esther was 20 years old when Satele was\nborn, which occurred four or five months after Richard and Esther were married.\nRichard worked long hours at two jobs during their first two years of marriage,\nand started to drink. They had physical fights in Satele‘s presence. When Satele\nwas two or three years old, Esther left. Richard quit his night job and moved in\nwith his parents in Carson, who helped to raise Satele until he was about 12 years\nold.\n       When Richard was not at work, he tried to spend as much time with\ndefendant Satele as he could. Satele was active in sports, and Richard attended\nevery sports practice and took time off from work to attend the games. Every year\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\ffrom the time Satele was five years old they vacationed in places like Samoa,\nHawaii, or Palm Springs.\n     Esther visited her son once or twice a year when he was between the ages of\ntwo and a half and five, and about once a month after that. When defendant Satele\nwas about seven or eight years old, he visited Esther on weekends. Every time she\nbrought Satele back to Richard‘s house he was in tears and wanted to stay with\nher. Esther did not have her own home, but lived with her sister, and she did not\nthink that environment would be best for her son. When Satele was 11 or 12 years\nold, Esther returned to live with him and his father. She was never involved with\nSatele‘s education, and she did not meet his teachers or attend school functions.\n     When defendant Satele was about 12 years old, Richard bought a house in\nRedondo Beach. Satele was unhappy that he had to change schools. He was\ncaught ―tagging‖ (spray painting graffiti) at the school and was suspended.\nRichard typically disciplined Satele by slapping or using a belt, and on this\noccasion he ―gave him a good beating‖ with a belt. Satele was caught tagging\nagain a couple of months later, and told the school he did not want to go home\nbecause his father would beat him. The school contacted child protective services,\nwhich told Richard that corporal punishment was against the law and he could be\nprosecuted if another incident occurred. Richard turned to other forms of\ndiscipline, such as denying privileges, but ―troubles just kept on increasing.‖\n     Defendant Satele ran away on one occasion for a weekend, and on another\noccasion for a week, and Richard did not know where he was during those times.\nRichard asked Satele what they could do to stop this activity, and Satele said he\nwanted to return to Carson and live with his grandparents. Richard allowed him to\ndo so, and every day he drove his son to school in Carson. Satele ran away from\nhis grandparents‘ house as well, and began cutting classes. He received A‘s and\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fB‘s in classes he liked, such as math, and D‘s and F‘s in classes he disliked, such\nas English.\n     When defendant Satele was about 15, he was caught tagging again. Because\nof his previous offenses, he was incarcerated for three months in juvenile camp.\nRichard and Esther visited him every weekend. After leaving camp, he seemed to\ncommunicate more openly with his parents, and was interested in graduating from\nhigh school and possibly playing football.\n     When defendant Satele was 16, the police found him carrying a gun. He was\nplaced in a military boot camp for about four months, and Richard said he\nreceived ―rav[e] reviews.‖ Satele acknowledged that he needed discipline and did\nwell in that environment. He was about 17 years old when he was released, and\nexpressed a desire to graduate from school and ―do good.‖ He took night classes\nin addition to his regular school schedule so he could catch up. Six months later,\nwhen he was still 17 years old, he left home and dropped out of continuation\nschool. Richard eventually found him in Wilmington. Although he knew how to\ncontact Satele if he needed to, he left his son alone to fend for himself.\n     Looking back on defendant Satele‘s life, Esther believed she had failed him\n―constantly‖ as a mother. Richard asked the families of Renesha and Edward to\nforgive his son and asked the jury to spare his life.\n     Dr. Samuel Miles, a psychiatrist, testified that he interviewed defendant\nSatele three times and also interviewed Satele‘s parents. Esther and Richard split\nup and reconciled many times, and Satele‘s lack of consistent interaction with\nthem, according to Dr. Miles, significantly affected the development of his\nidentity. Satele‘s first memory was of riding a skateboard at about the age of 11;\nalthough he also recalled events between the ages of two and six, Dr. Miles could\nnot be certain these were not ―indirect memor[ies]‖ related to Satele by another\nindividual.\n\n                                          20\n\f     In Dr. Miles‘s view, being in a gang provided defendant Satele a consistent\nenvironment where he was accepted, which he could not get at home. Richard‘s\nphysical punishment of Satele alienated Satele, and left Richard with no effective\nform of discipline when he stopped using it. Although Satele was 20 years old\nwhen Dr. Miles first interviewed him, ―emotionally he was more like 12.‖\nDr. Miles acknowledged that despite Satele‘s emotional immaturity, he knew the\ndifference between right and wrong.\n     Dr. Miles administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory to\ndefendant Satele; the results were ―highly pathological,‖ showing someone in\nturmoil who had identity problems and might be psychotic. He asked for\nadditional testing of Satele by a psychologist, on which Satele scored in the\nborderline range in intelligence, but not low enough to be considered mentally\nretarded. On the Wide Range Achievement Test, Satele scored ―in the average\nrange for someone who is in high school,‖ and reported he took no special classes\nfor the learning disabled. Satele gave few responses on the Rorschach inkblot test,\nwhich can occur when a person is ―overwhelmed by [the ink blots] and excited or\nvery guarded.‖ His responses on the ―Milikin clinical, multi-axle test‖ (sic: most\nlikely the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory) showed ―some turmoil and a\nhistory of some problems with the law.‖\n     According to Dr. Miles, defendant Satele did not have hallucinations.\nDr. Miles believed that at times Satele may have experienced paranoid delusions,\nbut Satele denied doing so. Satele said he generally became ―paranoid when he\nwas up a lot and on . . . amphetamine.‖ He told Dr. Miles he drank heavily and\nused methamphetamine four or five days at a time. According to Dr. Miles, an\nindividual who has experienced paranoia while using amphetamine is more likely\nto become paranoid when using the drug again. Satele said that around the time of\nthe murders he was ―loaded‖ and had not slept for several days.\n\n                                          21\n\f     Dr. Miles concluded that defendant Satele lost control when he was agitated,\nwas impulsive and aggressive, and had turmoil, identity problems, paranoia, low\nself-esteem, and ―fragility.‖ The combined effect of these circumstances left\nSatele with ―less than the average amount of control over impulsiveness,‖ ―prone\nto undue influence[] from others,‖ and more of a follower than a leader. They also\nmade him subject to substance abuse, and when abusing substances to have\n―periodically bad experiences‖ that made him react to others in a hostile fashion.\nDr. Miles diagnosed Satele with amphetamine abuse, alcohol abuse, probable\npsychosis not otherwise specified, and borderline personality disorder.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Pretrial Issues\n\n           1. Excusal of prospective juror based on her death penalty views\n\n               a. Factual background\n     On her juror questionnaire, in response to the question ―In what ways, if any,\nmight your religious views affect your service as a juror in this case,‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 2066 wrote: ―I would not send any person to death. The Bible say[s]\nthou shalt not kill.‖ In response to the question ―Would you, because of any views\nthat you may have concerning capital punishment, refuse to find the defendant\nguilty of first degree murder, even though you personally believe the defendant to\nbe guilty of first degree murder, just to prevent the penalty phase from taking\nplace‖ she wrote, ―I don‘t know yet.‖ When asked whether, because of her views\non capital punishment, she would refuse to find a special circumstance true, even\nthough she personally believed it to be true, ―just to prevent the penalty phase\nfrom taking place,‖ she said, ―No.‖\n     When asked on the questionnaire whether she would ―automatically refuse to\nvote in favor of the penalty of death and automatically vote for a penalty of life\n\n\n                                         22\n\fimprisonment without the possibility of parole,‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 wrote\n―Yes.‖ Asked if she would change her answer to this question if she was\ninstructed and ordered by the court that she must consider and weigh the\naggravating and mitigating factors regarding the facts of the crime and the\nbackground and character of the defendant before voting on the issue of penalty,\nshe wrote, ―I might.‖ In response to the question ―Could you set aside your own\npersonal feelings regarding what the law ought to be and follow the law as the\ncourt explains it to you‖ she wrote, ―I don‘t know if I could.‖ Asked to describe\nher ―general feelings about the death penalty,‖ she wrote, ―I don‘t feel at ease with\nit.‖ When asked to identify the statement ―that best describes your views on the\ndeath penalty,‖ she selected, ―While I am strongly opposed to the death penalty, I\ndo believe there are rare cases where a death sentence should be imposed for a\ndeliberate murder.‖ When asked, ―Can you fairly and impartially listen and weigh\nthe evidence, set aside any moral, religious, or personal views and/or beliefs you\nmay have about the death penalty to render a verdict in accordance with law‖ she\nwrote, ―I don‘t know.‖\n     On voir dire, the trial court asked Prospective Juror No. 2066 what she meant\nby her response of ―I don‘t know yet‖ to the question asking whether her views on\ncapital punishment would cause her to find a defendant not guilty of first degree\nmurder, even if she personally believed him to be guilty, to prevent the penalty\nphase from taking place. She replied: ―Undecided. I would kind of make it\nlenient.‖ The court later asked, ―[I]f you were to sit as a juror in a case in which\nthe death penalty is sought, and you get to the penalty phase, . . . would you be\nable, upon consideration of any aggravating and mitigating factors, to impose the\ndeath penalty if you feel it is warranted? Would you be able to vote for it, in other\nwords?‖ She replied: ―I probably would be hesitant. I wouldn‘t want to vote for\n. . . the death penalty.‖\n\n                                          23\n\f     The prosecutor then said to Prospective Juror No. 2066, ―I think that\ncoincides with your answer . . . where you said, ‗I don‘t feel at ease with it.‘ ‖ She\nreplied, ―Right.‖ The prosecutor began, ―I take it that it‘s such a difficult decision\nfor you —‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 interrupted to say, ―Yes, it is.‖ The\nprosecutor continued ―— that you could not vote for the death penalty?‖ She said,\n―Yes.‖\n     Defendant Nunez‘s counsel asked, ―Is it correct that after you hear all of the\nevidence you will follow the instructions on the law and do what the law requires\nyou to do in this state based upon how you find the facts to be?‖ Prospective Juror\nNo. 2066 replied, ―I‘ll do my best, yes.‖\n     The trial court asked Prospective Juror No. 2066 whether she would\nautomatically exclude the possibility of voting to impose the death penalty if she\nconcluded the facts of the case warranted such a penalty. She replied, ―If there\nwere other alternatives, I would probably . . . look at those first before choosing\nthe death penalty.‖ The court stated there would be only two choices at any\npenalty phase, and asked, ―Would you weigh the evidence to decide which\nalternative between the two you should choose?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066\nreplied, ―Yes.‖ The court subsequently asked, ―And if the evidence on the\naggravation and mitigation warrants that the . . . death penalty should be imposed,\nwould you be able to vote for death, knowing there is a possibility that you could\nchoose life without possibility of parole?‖ She replied, ―Yes.‖\n     The prosecutor explained to Prospective Juror No. 2066 again that her two\nchoices at the penalty phase were voting for the death penalty or for life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, and inquired whether she would\n―automatically vote for the life in prison sentence.‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066\nsaid, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―Even if I put on a bunch of aggravating\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\ffactors about various things, would you still vote for that life sentence?‖ She\nreplied, ―Yes, I think I would.‖\n     Defendant Nunez‘s counsel asked, ―Can you conceive of a crime so heinous\nthat you would ever vote for death?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 responded, ―No,\nI don‘t think so.‖ Counsel subsequently asked, ―If . . . you see there are only two\nalternatives, he goes to prison . . . for the rest of their natural life, or they go up to\nprison to be killed; are you saying you could never, ever, no matter what it was,\nsay, ‗Well, I will vote for death?‘ ‖ She replied, ―Yes, I‘m saying that right now.‖\nCounsel asked, ―You didn‘t say that a minute ago?‖ She said, ―Maybe the\nquestion was presented to me a little different.‖\n     The trial court asked, ―Do you believe that a case could be so bad that you\nwould vote for death?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 replied, ―I believe a case could\nbe that bad, but I still wouldn‘t want to vote the death penalty.‖ The court\nsubsequently asked, ―Is it you couldn‘t or you don‘t want to, or both?‖ She\nreplied, ―Both.‖\n     Defendant Satele‘s counsel asked, ―[I]f you made up your mind that the\ndecision you made up was the prosecution has established to you a belief this\nperson is a really bad person and that person deserves the death penalty, could you\ndo it?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 replied, ―It would be hard for me.‖ Counsel\nsaid: ―I understand. It‘s hard for everybody. That is [a] tough decision. Could\nyou?‖ She replied, ―I don‘t know if I could.‖\n     The prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror No. 2066 for cause. The trial\ncourt sustained the challenge, stating: ―This court has examined the juror‘s state\nof mind, particularly the demeanor in this case, and the reluctance of the\nresponses, and the equivocal responses that the juror has had, and the conflicting\nresponses that the juror has had. And this court makes the determination as to the\njuror‘s state of mind, and she is incapable of imposing the death penalty. And the\n\n                                            25\n\freason [is] . . . because of her reluctance to be able to do that when asked her the\nleading question as to whether or not she could impose it under certain\ncircumstances she said, yes; but when asked if there‘s another choice, life\nimprisonment, what would she do, she, without reluctance and without\nequivocation, chose life imprisonment if there‘s a choice. Given that is the case,\nand given her responses in the questionnaire, her demeanor in the court and her\nstate of mind as observed by this court, with multiple inferences that are given, the\ncourt infers based upon her responses that she is not death qualified and excuses\nher for cause.‖\n\n                  b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend that the trial court erroneously excused Prospective Juror\nNo. 2066 based on her views regarding the death penalty, in violation of their\nrights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution.\n     The Attorney General argues that defendants have forfeited their arguments\nbased on the Fifth and Eighth Amendments because, at trial, they did not\nchallenge the trial court‘s excusal of Prospective Juror No. 2066 on these grounds,\nalthough the Attorney General acknowledges that no objection was required to the\nextent defendants‘ challenge is based on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nUnder the law applicable at the time this case was tried, ―an appellate challenge to\na Witherspoon/Witt excusal is not forfeited by a failure to object at trial‖ (People\nv. McKinnon (2011) 52 Cal.4th 610, 637; see Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) 391\nU.S. 510; Wainwright v. Witt (1985) 469 U.S. 412), although the forfeiture rule\napplies to defendants who fail to object in cases tried after McKinnon became\nfinal. (McKinnon, at p. 643.) The rule that no objection was necessary applies\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\fregardless of the constitutional provision on which the challenge is based. We\ntherefore address defendants‘ claims on the merits.\n     ―The federal constitutional standard for dismissing a prospective juror for\ncause based on his or her views of capital punishment is ‗ ―[w]hether the juror‘s\nviews would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a\njuror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Friend\n(2009) 47 Cal.4th 1, 56 (Friend), quoting Uttecht v. Brown (2007) 551 U.S. 1, 7.)\n― ‗On appeal, we will uphold the trial court‘s ruling if it is fairly supported by the\nrecord.‘ ‖ (People v. Barnett (1998) 17 Cal.4th 1044, 1114.) ―When the\nprospective juror‘s answers on voir dire are conflicting or equivocal, the trial\ncourt‘s findings as to the prospective juror‘s state of mind are binding . . . if\nsupported by substantial evidence.‖ (People v. Duenas (2012) 55 Cal.4th 1, 10.)\n     Here, Prospective Juror No. 2066 equivocated and gave conflicting responses\nto questions pertaining to her ability to follow the law concerning imposition of\nthe death penalty. On the one hand, she wrote on her juror questionnaire that she\n―would not send any person to death‖ because ―[t]he Bible say[s] thou shalt not\nkill,‖ and that she would refuse to vote in favor of the death penalty and would\nautomatically vote for a penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole because of her views concerning capital punishment. On voir dire, she\nagreed with the prosecutor that she ―could not vote for the death penalty.‖ On the\nother hand, Prospective Juror No. 2066 also answered ―yes,‖ when asked if she\nwould ―weigh the evidence to decide‖ whether to vote for death or life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, and she said she would be ―able to\nvote for death‖ if she concluded that ―the evidence on the aggravation and\nmitigation warrants that the . . . death penalty should be imposed.‖\n     The trial court was in a position, which we are not, to view Prospective Juror\nNo. 2066‘s demeanor, and its determination of her state of mind is binding.\n\n                                           27\n\f―Deference to the trial court is appropriate because it is in a position to assess the\ndemeanor of the venire, and of the individuals who compose it, a factor of critical\nimportance in assessing the attitude and qualifications of potential jurors.‖\n(Uttecht v. Brown, supra, 551 U.S. at p. 9.) ―Hence, the trial judge may be left\nwith the ‗definite impression‘ that the person cannot impartially apply the law\neven though, as is often true, [she] has not expressed [her] views with absolute\nclarity.‖ (People v. DePriest (2007) 42 Cal.4th 1, 21.) Here, substantial evidence\nsupports the trial court‘s determination that Prospective Juror No. 2066‘s views on\nthe death penalty would prevent or substantially impair her ability to serve as a\njuror.\n     The cases on which defendants rely (People v. Heard (2003) 31 Cal.4th 946;\nPeople v. Pearson (2012) 53 Cal.4th 306 (Pearson)) are inapposite. Unlike the\nprospective juror wrongly excused in Heard, Prospective Juror No. 2066 did not\nindicate on voir dire she ―was prepared to follow the law and had no\npredisposition one way or the other as to imposition of the death penalty,‖ nor was\nshe generally ―clear in [her] declarations that [she] would attempt to fulfill [her]\nresponsibilities as a juror in accordance with the court‘s instructions and [her]\noath.‖ (Heard, at p. 967.)\n     Defendant Nunez asserts it is significant that Pearson, supra, 53 Cal.4th 306,\ninvolved the same trial judge as in this case. The trial here occurred before the\ntrial in Pearson. In Pearson, we concluded that the trial court erroneously\nexcused a prospective juror whose views on the death penalty in general were\n―vague and largely unformed‖ (id. at p. 330), but who ―made no conflicting or\nequivocal statements about her ability to vote for a death penalty in a factually\nappropriate case‖ (ibid.). We observed that the trial court had misunderstood and\nmisapplied People v. Guzman (1988) 45 Cal.3d 915, 956 (Guzman) (overruled on\nother grounds in Price v. Superior Court (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1046, 1069, fn. 13),\n\n                                          28\n\fwhich held that a prospective juror‘s use of equivocal phrases such as ―I think‖ or\n―I believe‖ when expressing an inability to vote for death did not preclude the trial\ncourt from properly finding that the prospective juror‘s ability to follow the trial\ncourt‘s instructions would be substantially impaired. The trial court in Pearson\nerroneously stated that, under Guzman, it could excuse a prospective juror because\nthe prospective juror expressed equivocal views about capital punishment in\ngeneral. This view, we explained, was wrong. Guzman, we said, ―does not stand\nfor the idea that a person is substantially impaired for jury service in a capital case\nbecause his or her ideas about the death penalty are indefinite, complicated or\nsubject to qualifications . . . .‖ (Pearson, at p. 331.)\n     Here, defendant Nunez argues that certain comments by the trial court earlier\nin the jury selection process reflect the same misunderstanding of the holding in\nGuzman, supra, 45 Cal.3d at page 956, that it expressed during the trial of\nPearson. Whether or not Nunez is correct, the court‘s explanation for excusing\nProspective Juror No. 2066 does not reflect that misunderstanding. Unlike the\nprospective juror wrongly excused in Pearson, Prospective Juror No. 2066 did not\nmerely express equivocal views about the death penalty in general; rather, she\nmade ―conflicting or equivocal statements about her ability to vote for a death\npenalty in a factually appropriate case.‖ (Pearson, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 330,\nitalics added.) Based on those responses, the trial court found that Prospective\nJuror No. 2066 ―is incapable of imposing the death penalty.‖ This finding was\ntantamount to a finding that her views about the death penalty would\n― ‗ ―substantially impair‖ ‘ ‖ her ability to perform her duties as a juror. (Friend,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 56.) Because substantial evidence supports that finding, the\ntrial court properly excused Prospective Juror No. 2066 for cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f           2. Denial of defense challenge for cause\n     Defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their challenge for\ncause to Prospective Juror No. 8971, who was later sworn as an alternate juror and\neventually served on the penalty jury.2 Defendants forfeited this claim because\ndefendants did not use an available peremptory challenge to remove Prospective\nJuror No. 8971. ― ‗As a general rule, a party may not complain on appeal of an\nallegedly erroneous denial of a challenge for cause because the party need not\ntolerate having the prospective juror serve on the jury; a litigant retains the power\nto remove the juror by exercising a peremptory challenge. Thus, to preserve this\nclaim for appeal we require . . . that a litigant actually exercise a peremptory\nchallenge and remove the prospective juror in question.‘ ‖ (People v. Jones\n(2012) 54 Cal.4th 1, 45.) Defendants failed to do so, and cannot now complain\nabout the trial court‘s asserted error.\n\n       B. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n           1. Challenge to impeachment of Lawrence Kelly\n\n                a. Factual background\n     Lawrence Kelly testified on behalf of defendant Satele that he had been a\nmember of the West Side Wilmas gang for 12 to 13 years, that he had known\n\n\n2     In this and certain other appellate claims defendants contend the asserted\nerror infringed upon their constitutional rights. In those instances where they did\nnot present constitutional theories below, ―it appears that either (1) the appellate\nclaim is one that required no objection to preserve it, or (2) the new arguments are\nbased on factual or legal standards no different from those the trial court was\nasked to apply, but raise the additional legal consequence of violating the\nConstitution‖ (People v. Loker (2008) 44 Cal.4th 691, 704, fn. 7), and to that\nextent their new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal (ibid.). ―No\nseparate constitutional discussion is required, or provided, when rejection of a\nclaim on the merits necessarily leads to rejection of any constitutional theory or\n‗gloss‘ raised for the first time here.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fdefendant Satele for about two years, and that he had never heard Satele ―use the\n‗N‘ word‖ or display disrespect for Black persons. This testimony contradicted\nevidence introduced by the prosecution that Satele had referred to Blacks as\n―niggers.‖ Kelly also testified that he was present with both defendants at a park\nplayground about midnight on the night of the murders, and he did not hear\ndefendant Satele say, ―We were out looking for niggers,‖ or either defendant say,\n―I think we got one.‖ This contradicted the prosecution‘s evidence that defendants\nmade these statements.\n     On cross-examination, Kelly denied that while at the house of Glenn Phillips,\nKelly had offered a Black person $100 either to testify that West Side Wilmas and\n―African Americans get along,‖ or to say, ―We get along.‖\n     When the prosecutor called Glenn Phillips to testify on rebuttal, defendant\nNunez objected under Evidence Code section 352, and defendant Satele objected\nthat the testimony was irrelevant. Outside the jury‘s presence, the trial court held\na hearing, at which Phillips testified that in November 1999, Lawrence Kelly\nvisited Phillips‘s home, where he spoke to Warren Battle, a Black man who\nworked for Phillips. Kelly asked Battle if he wanted to ―make a hundred bucks,‖\nexplaining that he needed Battle to testify that ―we get along with Black people.‖\nKelly did not say who he meant by the word ―we,‖ but Phillips assumed he was\nreferring to the West Side Wilmas gang.\n     The prosecutor offered Phillips‘s testimony for the purpose of impeaching\nKelly, who had denied offering anyone money to testify. The trial court precluded\nthe prosecutor from asking Phillips whom he thought Kelly was referring to when\nKelly used the word ―we,‖ but it allowed the remainder of the testimony, finding\nthat it directly controverted Kelly‘s testimony, and that its probative value\noutweighed its prejudicial effect. Phillips then testified before the jury regarding\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fKelly‘s statement. His testimony was consistent with his testimony at the\nhearing. (See p. 13, ante.)\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend the trial court should have sustained their objection to\nthe impeaching testimony by witness Phillips, described above in part II.B.1.a.\nWe disagree.\n     ―Rebuttal evidence is relevant and thus admissible if it ‗tend[s] to disprove a\nfact of consequence on which the defendant has introduced evidence.‘ [Citation.]\nThe trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of\nevidence in rebuttal.‖ (People v. Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 936; see People v.\nMills (2010) 48 Cal.4th 158, 195 [the trial court has ―broad power to control the\npresentation of proposed impeachment evidence‖].) Here, as the trial court\nobserved, Phillips‘s testimony directly contradicted Kelly‘s testimony on the issue\nof whether Kelly had attempted to bribe a witness ―to testify we get along with\nBlack people,‖ and hence was relevant to assessing Kelly‘s credibility as a\nwitness. (See People v. Millwee (1998) 18 Cal.4th 96, 128 [evidence bearing on a\nwitness‘s credibility is proper rebuttal].) The trial court therefore did not abuse its\ndiscretion in admitting the testimony.\n     Defendants point out that the prosecution made no showing that they\nauthorized or encouraged Kelly to try to influence a witness, and hence the\nevidence could not be used to demonstrate their consciousness of guilt. But the\nevidence was not introduced to show defendants‘ consciousness of guilt, but to\nimpeach Kelly‘s credibility. Defendants argue that Phillips‘s testimony was\nunduly prejudicial because there was ―a high likelihood that the jury [would]\nmisuse the evidence‖ to ―infer consciousness of guilt.‖ Not so. No evidence\nconnected defendants to Kelly‘s bribery attempt, and the jury was instructed that\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f―[i]f you find that an[] effort to procure false or fabricated evidence was made by\nanother person for the defendant‘s benefit, you may not consider that effort as\ntending to show[] the defendant‘s consciousness of guilt unless you also find that\nthe defendant authorized that effort.‖\n     Defendants point out that Kelly‘s testimony that he had never offered money\nto Battle to testify for the defense was first elicited by the prosecution on cross-\nexamination; Kelly had not testified about that subject on direct examination. The\nprosecution, defendants contend, used its cross-examination questions to Kelly for\nthe purpose of creating the necessity for witness Phillips‘s testimony impeaching\nKelly. The trial court, they assert, should have forestalled this tactical maneuver\nby excluding Phillips‘s testimony. Even if we assume for the sake of argument\nthat defendants‘ objection at trial was adequate to preserve this claim, it lacks\nmerit. The prosecutor was free to explore on cross-examination whether Kelly\nhad attempted to bribe a witness because such evidence was relevant to Kelly‘s\ncredibility. Once Kelly denied the event, Phillips‘s testimony was admissible to\nimpeach Kelly. Although defendants are correct that Phillips‘s testimony would\nnot generally have been admissible if Kelly had admitted that the bribery attempt\nconversation had occurred, that does not mean Kelly‘s attempted bribe was a\ncollateral issue.\n     Defendants assert that in closing argument, the prosecutor misstated the\npurpose for which the trial court had admitted Phillips‘s impeaching testimony,\nthereby increasing the likelihood that the testimony would confuse the jury. The\nprosecutor argued: ―Glenn Phillips was called to show you that . . . [Kelly]\noffered an African-American a hundred dollars to say we get along. Is [Kelly] a\nwitness . . . you are going to believe in this courtroom? Somebody that . . . would\ngo to the extent of going up to [an] African-American and say if you go into court\nand say something for us. Mr. Phillips has no axe to grind in here. . . . [Kelly] is\n\n                                          33\n\fthe person who hangs around Glenn Phillips [and] . . . offered a hundred dollars to\na witness to lie in this case. What does that tell you about [Kelly], and his\ntestimony here?‖ The prosecutor also argued, ―I‘ve already spoken about the fact\nthat [Phillips] said [Kelly] bribed an individual with [a] hundred bucks to come in\nhere and lie.‖\n     Defendants did not object to the prosecutor‘s argument at the penalty phase\nor seek an admonition, and no exception to the general rule requiring an objection\nand request for admonition is applicable. The claim is therefore forfeited. (People\nv. Samayoa (1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 841 (Samayoa).) It also lacks merit.\nDefendants point out that in the argument quoted above, the prosecutor claimed\nthat Kelly had tried to bribe a witness. But, defendants assert, Phillips‘s testimony\nwas admitted only to impeach Kelly‘s testimony, not to show that an attempted\nbribe occurred. The prosecutor‘s argument, they reason, most likely caused the\njury to draw the improper inference that defendants had asked Kelly to offer the\nbribe.\n     We see nothing improper in the prosecutor‘s argument, nor is there a\nreasonable likelihood that it would have caused the jury to draw the improper\ninference described above. While the prosecutor was not entitled to invite the jury\nto infer that defendants were responsible for Kelly‘s bribery attempt, nothing in\nthe prosecutor‘s challenged comments asked the jury to draw such an inference.\nThus, contrary to defendants‘ contention, the prosecutor‘s argument was not\nconfusing, did not ask the jury to draw improper inferences, and did not increase\nthe likelihood that they would be prejudiced by Phillips‘s testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f           2. Challenge to evidence on rebuttal that defendant Satele hit an\n              inmate\n\n               a. Factual background\n     During the defense case, Darnell Demery, the husband of defendant Satele‘s\ncousin, testified that he had never heard Satele say anything derogatory about\nBlack persons or ―use the ‗N‘ word.‖ Nor had he seen Satele being aggressive,\nargumentative, or physical with anyone. Satele, Demery claimed, did not have a\nbad temper and got ―along with everybody.‖\n     At sidebar, the prosecutor sought the trial court‘s permission to ask Demery\nif he was aware that defendant Satele had attacked other inmates in jail when those\ninmates were restrained, and whether those incidents would affect his opinion of\nSatele. Satele‘s counsel appeared to note that one victim was Black and the other\nAsian. The trial court precluded this line of cross-examination, finding its\n―probative value outweighed by the prejudicial effect.‖\n     After this ruling, three defense witnesses testified that defendant Satele was\nnot prejudiced against Blacks. Satele‘s father testified that his son had never\nexhibited racial bias and had been taught to ―respect all races and all people.‖\nDr. Lewis Yablonski, the gang expert who had interviewed Satele and several\nother West Side Wilmas gang members, testified that he did not detect any racial\nanimus, and was of the view that Satele had no ―special hostility towards Black\npeople.‖ And Willy Guillory, a teacher at Satele‘s high school and a longtime\nfamily friend, testified that Satele caused no problems at school, had never\nreferred to Black persons as ―niggers,‖ and had never behaved ―against any racial\ncomponent in our society.‖\n     At the end of Guillory‘s testimony on direct examination, the prosecutor\nagain sought to introduce evidence that defendant Satele had assaulted handcuffed\ninmates on two occasions. He argued that these attacks showed racial animus and\n\n\n                                         35\n\fthat Satele had opened the door to the testimony. The trial court allowed the\ninquiry. The prosecutor then asked Guillory if his opinion that Satele treated\npeople of other races appropriately would change if he knew that Satele, while in\njail, had punched a handcuffed Black inmate in the face. Guillory said he would\n―find that highly unusual.‖ The prosecutor then asked, ―What happens if I also\ntold you‖ that Satele had slugged an inmate who was handcuffed to another\ninmate. Guillory responded, ―I would say it‘s . . . not the young man I knew . . . in\nhigh school.‖\n     On rebuttal, the prosecution called Deputy Larry Arias, who testified that on\nNovember 9, 1999, he was escorting a Black inmate named Keys in the Men‘s\nCentral Jail. Keys was ―waist chained‖ and could not raise his hands to his face.\nDefendant Satele punched Keys in the face, and Keys fell to the ground. Keys had\nnot provoked the attack. In Deputy Arias‘s opinion, Satele would improve his\nstanding within the Hispanic gangs in jail by attacking a Black man.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendant Satele contends that Deputy Arias‘s testimony should have been\npresented in the prosecution‘s case-in-chief, and was therefore improper rebuttal.\nHe did not raise this objection at trial, and the claim is therefore forfeited on\nappeal. (See People v. Williams (1976) 16 Cal.3d 663, 667, fn. 4 [―It is the\ngeneral rule . . . that questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be\nreviewed on appeal absent a specific and timely objection at trial on the ground\nsought to be urged on appeal‖].)\n     On the merits, it is improper for a prosecutor to withhold ―crucial evidence\nproperly belonging in the case-in-chief‖ (Friend, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 44; see\nalso People v. Carter (1957) 48 Cal.2d 737, 753), and to present it in rebuttal to\ntake unfair advantage of a defendant. Here, the information contained a special\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fcircumstance allegation that defendant Satele intentionally killed the victims\nbecause of their race, and enhancement allegations that he committed the murders\nin concert because of race, although the jury ultimately found the allegations not\ntrue. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(16), § 422.75, former subd. (c), now subd. (b).) Although\nevidence that Satele had without apparent provocation assaulted a Black inmate\nwas relevant to these allegations, it cannot properly be characterized as ―crucial\nevidence‖ on the issue of his racial animus. Moreover, any error in admitting\nDeputy Arias‘s testimony on rebuttal was harmless under any standard, because\nthe jury found not true the hate crime special circumstances and the allegations\nthat Satele committed the murders in concert because of race.\n     Defendant Satele contends that Deputy Arias‘s testimony that Satele attacked\na Black inmate had little probative value in rebutting testimony by defense\nwitnesses that he got along well with Blacks, because the prosecution offered no\nevidence that the attack was racially motivated. By contrast, he argues, the\ntestimony was unduly prejudicial because it showed his commission of a crime\nand tended to demonstrate his future dangerousness. Thus, he reasons, the trial\ncourt should have sustained his objection to the testimony on the ground that its\npotential prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. (Evid. Code, § 352.)\nWe disagree. Deputy Arias testified that Satele, without warning and completely\nwithout provocation, attacked a defenseless Black inmate. Because the attack\nresembled the murders with which defendants were charged, which also occurred\nin an unprovoked attack on defenseless Black victims, the jury could infer that it\nwas racially motivated. The prejudicial effect of the assault, in which the inmate\nwas apparently not seriously hurt, was minimal when contrasted to the murders\nwith which Satele was charged. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its broad\ndiscretion under Evidence Code section 352 when it ruled that the probative value\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fof Deputy Arias‘s testimony about the attack was not substantially outweighed by\nits prejudicial effect.\n     Defendant Satele contends that the trial court erred by failing to state that it\nhad weighed the probative value and prejudicial effect of Deputy Arias‘s\ntestimony when it overruled his objection to the evidence. He is wrong: A trial\ncourt is not required to ― ‗expressly weigh prejudice against probative value or\neven expressly state that it has done so, if the record as a whole shows the court\nwas aware of and performed its balancing function under Evidence Code section\n352.‘ ‖ (People v. Lewis (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1255, 1285.) Here, the record shows\nthat the trial court properly performed this task. Indeed, the trial court had\npreviously precluded the prosecutor from asking Demery, the husband of\ndefendant Satele‘s cousin, about the incident on cross-examination in the defense\ncase because the court found its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice.\n(See p. 35, ante.)\n\n            3. Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n     Both defendants contend that the prosecutor committed misconduct during\nclosing argument.\n     ―A prosecutor commits misconduct when his or her conduct either infects the\ntrial with such unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a denial of due\nprocess, or involves deceptive or reprehensible methods employed to persuade the\ntrier of fact.‖ (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 711.) ―As a general rule a\ndefendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a\ntimely fashion—and on the same ground—the defendant made an assignment of\nmisconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the\nimpropriety.‖ (Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f                 a. Asserted vouching by the prosecutor\n     Here, in closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor said: ―He [Ernie\nVasquez] identified Curly [Caballero] as the driver of that Buick. Isn‘t it amazing\nthat Curly just happened to be with Speedy and [Wilbone] earlier and it was\nbrought out that he was with them later, that Ernie Vasquez hit the nail on the\nhead? He identified Curly. What a coincidence. Because I guarantee that is the\ntruth. What he testified to was corroborated.‖ (Italics added.) Defendant Nunez\nobjected to the ―district attorney‘s guarantee that is the truth.‖ The trial court said:\n―Your objection is improper argument. Please make a legal basis. Sustained.\nCarry on.‖ Defendants did not request an admonition.\n     In defendant Satele‘s closing argument, his counsel asserted that much of the\ntape recording of defendants‘ conversation while they were being transported in\nthe van to and from court (see pp. 4-5, ante) was inaudible. In rebuttal, the\nprosecutor said: ―[A]ll you have to do is listen to his own words. Listen to Daniel\nNunez‘[s] own words track 2 at 2250, you will hear[.] [D]efendant‘s counsel says\nyou can‘t hear this stuff on the CD. You will hear it. I will back up my words.\nYou will hear this. You will hear him say, I want Black and then he thinks a – no\nBlacks. . . . What does that tell you about his feeling? We know what‘s going on\nin this mind of his. They can‘t justify it. The only way they can justify it you\nwon‘t hear that on the CD. I will stake my reputation on it. You listen [to] that\ntape, that CD at that point, and you will hear it.‖ (Italics added.) The trial court\nsustained defendant Nunez‘s objection to the ―guarantee by the district attorney.‖\nDefendants did not ask the court to admonish the jury to disregard the comment.\nThe prosecutor later said, ―[W]hen I was talking about the CD tape and transcript,\nyou listen to it. . . . I shouldn‘t say I sta[k]e my reputation. You be the judge[.]\n[Y]ou . . . . [l]isten you . . . judge for yourself.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\f     Defendants contend that the prosecutor‘s comments were misconduct\nbecause he relied on his personal beliefs. (See People v. Medina (1995) 11\nCal.4th 694, 776 [―prosecutors should not purport to rely in jury argument on their\noutside experience or personal beliefs based on facts not in evidence‖].)\nDefendants failed to seek an admonition as to either statement, no exception to the\ngeneral rule requiring a request for admonition is applicable, and the claim is\ntherefore forfeited on appeal. (Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.) Moreover,\nthe comments were not prejudicial: In both instances, the prosecutor explained\nthat the evidence in the record supported his view, the trial court sustained defense\nobjections to the challenged comments, and the prosecutor later told the jury as to\nhis argument about the CD, ―I shouldn‘t say I sta[k]e my reputation.‖\n\n                b. Asserted inconsistent arguments\n     Defendant Satele asserts the prosecutor committed misconduct when, after\narguing at the guilt phase that he did not know and had not proven who fired the\nmurder weapon, he argued at the penalty phase that defendant Satele was the\nshooter. Satele claims that as ―a result of this shift in theory, the prosecutor used\nfacts to increase [Satele‘s] culpability without proving those facts first in the guilt\nphase.‖\n     At the guilt phase, the prosecutor said in closing argument to the jury: ―You\nheard the testimony of Julie Rodriguez . . . [about] what they do when they\ncommit driveby murders like this. They have a driver, they have a shooter, and\nthey have people in the back to look for law enforcement, to look for\nwitnesses. . . . I will be the first one to tell you that I did not prove to you who the\nactual shooter was. Whether it was defendant Nunez or defendant Satele. But you\nknow they were in the car. An[d] whether they‘re in the backseat, the front seat,\nthe driver‘s seat, all three of those individuals knew what was going down that day\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\fand participated in this murder.‖ The prosecutor later argued: ―What happened?\nWe know at that point the Buick Regal . . . is going southbound on Frampton.\nCurly [Caballero] is driving — from the evidence, remember, Ernie [Vasquez]\nthought [defendant Satele] was in the front passenger seat. . . . [T]he person in the\nrear he thought looked like Speedy [defendant Nunez], or he resembled Speedy.\nSo let‘s go with it that way.‖\n     At the penalty phase, the prosecutor in closing argument to the jury discussed\nthe mitigating factor described in section 190.3, factor (j), which allows a jury to\nconsider, in deciding whether to impose a sentence of death, ―[w]hether or not the\ndefendant was an accomplice to the offense and his participation in the\ncommission of the offense was relatively minor.‖ The prosecutor said: ―[W]hat\nwere the roles of the defendants in the murdering of Edward and Renesha? . . . .\nNeither of these defendants . . . had a role which was minor. They were all major\nparticipants in this crime. . . . You . . . remember Ms. Rodriguez told you what\nhappens in a driveby shooting.‖ He noted that Vasquez had testified the driver\nwas Caballero, and that as for the person in the passenger seat who was the\nshooter, the prosecutor argued: ―The evidence . . . points to defendant Satele.‖\nThe prosecutor said that Contreras had heard defendant Satele say, ―I shot the\nBlack guy and that Black girl,‖ and reminded the jury of Vasquez‘s testimony that\nthe person in the passenger seat resembled Satele, and the person in the backseat\nresembled defendant Nunez. The prosecutor then asserted that even if defendant\nNunez was in the backseat, his role as a lookout for the police and for any\nwitnesses was not minor.\n     Defendant Satele did not object to the prosecutor‘s argument at the penalty\nphase or seek an admonition, and no exception to the general rule requiring an\nobjection and admonition request is applicable. The claim is therefore forfeited.\n(Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.) It is also meritless because the arguments\n\n                                         41\n\fat the guilt and penalty phases were not inconsistent. Rather, at both phases of\ntrial the prosecutor observed that the evidence, although inconclusive, indicated\nthat defendant Satele was most likely the shooter. At the penalty phase the\nprosecutor simply sought to persuade the jury that if it found defendant Nunez was\nin the backseat of the vehicle, this did not mean his participation was minor within\nthe meaning of section 190.3, factor (j). No misconduct occurred.\n\n           4. Challenge to gang enhancement instruction\n\n                a. Factual background\n     The prosecution alleged, as sentence enhancements to the murders charged in\ncounts 1 and 2 of the amended information, that defendants committed the\nmurders in violation of section 186.22‘s subdivision (b)(1) (section 186.22(b)(1),\nsometimes referred to as the gang enhancement). The gang enhancement provides\nfor an increased sentence when the underlying felony was committed ―for the\nbenefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with\nthe specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang\nmembers.‖ (Ibid.)\n     At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that West Side Wilmas gang\nmembers other than defendants had committed crimes. Detective Dinlocker\ntestified that Ruben Figueroa and Brian Dominic Martinez were West Side\nWilmas gang members, and the prosecution introduced records of Martinez‘s\nconviction for assault with a firearm and Figueroa‘s convictions for murder and\nassault with a deadly weapon.\n     During the guilt phase instruction conference, the trial court proposed to\ninstruct the jury with CALJIC No. 6.50, stating that this instruction concerned the\n―gang crime.‖ CALJIC No. 6.50 does not describe the elements of the gang\nenhancement with which defendants were charged, set forth in section\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f186.22(b)(1); instead, it gives the elements of a crime described in section\n186.22‘s subdivision (a) (hereafter the gang crime), which makes it a felony to\n―actively participate[] in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members\nengage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.‖\n     Defendant Satele‘s counsel said he did not object to the proposed instruction.\nThe prosecutor argued that the ―pattern of criminal gang activity‖ described in the\ninstruction should include what he referred to as Brian Dominic Martinez‘s\nconviction for assault with a deadly weapon,3 and Ruben Figueroa‘s convictions\nfor murder and assault with a deadly weapon. In response, Nunez‘s counsel\nunsuccessfully objected that the evidence did not show ―the necess[ary]\nrequirement[s],‖ presumably for the pattern of gang activity.\n     When the trial court read CALJIC No. 6.50 to the jury, it began: ―Defendant\nis accused in counts one and two of having violated section 186.22(a) of the Penal\nCode, a crime. Every person who actively participates . . . is guilty of the\nviolation of Penal Code section 186.22(a), a crime.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―That\nshould be subdivision b, as in boy?‖ The court replied, ―I‘m sorry, subdivision b.‖\nThe court then repeated this portion of the instruction, inserting the letter ―(b)‖\ninstead of ―(a)‖ throughout.4 In the written instructions, which the jury received,\nthe ―(a)‖ in ―section 186.22, subdivision (a)‖ was replaced by hand with ―(b).‖\n\n3     Martinez was actually convicted of assault with a firearm (§ 245, subd.\n(a)(2)), not assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)).\n4     The trial court instructed the jury: ―Defendant is accused in counts one and\ntwo of having violated section 186[].22(b) of the Penal Code, a crime. Every\nperson who actively participates in any criminal street gang with knowledge that\nthe members are engaged in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity,\nand who willfully promotes[,] furthers[,] or assists in any felonious criminal\nconduct by members of that gang is guilty of the violation of Penal Code section\n186.22(b[])[,] [a] crime. [¶] ‗Pattern of criminal gang activity‘ means the\ncommission of or attempted commission or solicitation of sustained juvenile\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      In his closing argument, the prosecutor asserted: ―[T]here‘s an allegation\nwhich we proved under 186.22 called a gang allegation, that this crime was\ncommitted for the benefit of West Side Wilmas. And it was.‖ The prosecutor also\nsaid that under the gang allegation he was required to prove several elements,\nincluding a pattern of criminal gang activity. To do so, he relied on Figueroa‘s\nmurder and assault with a deadly weapon convictions, and Martinez‘s ―assault\nwith a firearm, which is a deadly weapon‖ conviction. He also asserted: ―The last\nelement of that gang allegation is that this crime was committed for the benefit of\nthat gang. You heard me question Julie Rodriguez. She testified it was, in her\nopinion. You also can see it from People‘s 43 [which included a photograph of\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\npetition for, or conviction of two or more of the following crimes, namely murder\nand assault with [a] deadly weapon, provided at least one of those crimes occurred\nafter September 23, 1988, and the last of those crimes occurred within three years\nafter a prior offense, and the crimes are committed on separate occasions [or] by\ntwo or more persons. [¶] ‗Criminal street gang‘ means any ongoing . . .\nassociation or group of three or more persons[,] whether formal or informal,\nhaving as one of [its] primary activities, 1. the commission of one or more . . . of\nthe following criminal acts, murder and assault with a deadly weapon; 2. having a\ncommon name or common identifying sign or symbol; and 3. whose members\nindividually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal\ngang activity. [¶] Active participation means that the person, 1. must have a\ncurrent relationship with the criminal street gang that is more than in name only[,]\npassive, inactive or purely technical, and 2. must devote all or a substantial part of\nhis time or efforts to the criminal street gang. [¶] Felonious criminal conduct\nincludes murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon. In order to prove this crime\neach of the following elements must be proved: 1. A person actively and\ncurrently participates in a criminal street gang; 2. The members of that gang\nengage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity; 3. That person\nknew that the gang members engaged [in] or have engaged in a pattern of criminal\ngang activity; and 4. That person aided and abetted a member of that gang in\ncommitting the crimes of murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon.‖ (See\nCALJIC No. 6.50 (6th ed. 1999 rev.).)\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fgraffiti] [and] from the actions of Wilbone against Mr. Keys that they did this to\npromote their gang.‖ The jury found the gang enhancement allegations to be true.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend that the gang enhancement findings should be vacated\nbecause the trial court committed prejudicial error by instructing the jury on the\nelements of the gang crime (§ 186.22, subd. (a)) when they were charged with the\ngang enhancement (§ 186.22(b)(1)). We agree.\n     The trial court‘s instruction (see p. 43, fn. 4, ante) told the jury that the\ncharged gang enhancements (erroneously referred to by the instruction as\n―crimes‖) contained four elements: ―1. A person actively and currently\nparticipates in a criminal street gang; 2. The members of that gang engage in or\nhave engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity; 3. That person knew that the\ngang members engaged [in] or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity;\nand 4. That person aided and abetted a member of that gang in committing the\ncrimes of murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon.‖ This list omitted two\nelements of the gang enhancements charged in the amended information. First,\nthe instruction did not tell the jury that to find the enhancements true, it must find\nthat defendants committed the murders ―for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in\nassociation with any criminal street gang‖ (§ 186.22(b)(1)); second, the instruction\ndid not tell the jury that to find the enhancements true, it must find that defendants\ncommitted the murders ―with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in\nany criminal conduct by gang members‖ (ibid.).\n     The Attorney General claims that the jury was adequately instructed on the\nelements of the gang enhancements. As explained below, her arguments are not\npersuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f     As to the element that the crimes charged were committed for the benefit of,\nat the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang, the Attorney\nGeneral notes that the instruction required that the jury find ―active participation‖\nin a criminal street gang, which the instruction defined as ―a current relationship\nwith the criminal street gang that is more than in name only[,] passive, inactive or\npurely technical,‖ in which the defendant devoted ―all or a substantial part of his\ntime or efforts‖ to the gang.5 She asserts that this portion of the instruction —\ntogether with the reasonable doubt instruction and the instruction to consider the\ninstructions as a whole — required the jury ―to deduce that to find the gang\ncharges true, there had to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendants] . . .\ncommitted the murders ‗in association with‘ their gang.‖ But there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury would not have understood the instruction as requiring it to\nmake such a finding. The portion of the instruction concerning active\nparticipation simply addresses a defendant‘s level of involvement with the street\ngang, not whether the defendant committed the charged crimes for the benefit of,\nat the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang.\n     The Attorney General asserts that the trial court‘s instruction said, in essence,\nthat the jury could consider proof that the defendants committed the charged\nmurders as evidence of a ―pattern of gang activity.‖ According to the Attorney\nGeneral, this portion of the instruction, considered in combination with the\nreasonable doubt instruction, told the jury it could find the gang enhancements\ntrue only if it found ―evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged murders\n\n\n5     After the trial in this case, we held that the language ―actively participates in\nany criminal street gang‖ in section 186.22(a) means ―involvement with a criminal\nstreet gang that is more than nominal or passive.‖ (People v. Castaneda (2000) 23\nCal.4th 743, 747.)\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fwere committed for the ‗benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with‘ the\ndefendant‘s gang.‖ This argument mischaracterizes the instruction. The portion\nof the instruction mentioned by the Attorney General did not mention the charged\nmurders; rather, it told the jury it could consider ―murder and assault with [a]\ndeadly weapon‖ as evidence of a ― ‗pattern of criminal gang activity.‘ ‖ But the\nprosecutor expressly relied on the convictions of Figueroa and Martinez for\nmurder and assault with a deadly weapon — and not the charged murders — to\nshow the requisite pattern of activity. Moreover, even if the jury understood this\nportion of the instruction as referring to the charged murders as well as those\nconvictions, the instruction did not tell the jury that it must find that the charged\nmurders were gang related in order to find the enhancements true.\n     The Attorney General argues that the trial court‘s instruction told the jury to\nfind each gang enhancement true only if the evidence showed ―beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the defendant ‗aided and abetted‘ a fellow gang member in\ncommitting the charged murder.‖ The Attorney General is incorrect. The court\ninstructed the jury that ―[i]n order to prove this crime‖ (by which the court meant\nthe gang enhancements), several elements ―must be proved,‖ one of which was\nthat a ―person aided and abetted a member of that gang in committing the crimes\nof murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon.‖ The prosecutor expressly relied\non the convictions of Figueroa and Martinez for murder and assault with a deadly\nweapon to show a pattern of criminal gang activity, and the phrase ―murder and\nassault with [a] deadly weapon‖ was repeated throughout the instruction. There is\na reasonable likelihood that the jury interpreted this phrase as referring only to\nthose convictions; indeed, defendants were not charged with assault with a deadly\nweapon. Nor is it dispositive that the prosecutor asserted ―[t]he last element of\nthat gang allegation is that this crime was committed for the benefit of that gang.‖\nThe court had already instructed the jury before closing argument that ―[i]f\n\n                                          47\n\fanything concerning the law said by the attorneys in their arguments or at any\nother time during the trial conflicts with my instructions on the law, you must\nfollow my instructions.‖\n     As to the specific intent element of section 186.22(b)(1) (that is, the\nrequirement that the prosecution prove that the charged crimes were committed\nwith the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by\ngang members), the Attorney General contends this element was adequately\naddressed when the trial court instructed the jury that the enhancement required\nproof that a defendant ―willfully promote[d][,] further[ed][,] or assist[ed] in any\nfelonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.‖ (Italics added.) Although\nthe Attorney General acknowledges that ― ‗willfully‘ in a penal statute usually\ndefines a general criminal intent‖ (People v. Atkins (2001) 25 Cal.4th 76, 85), she\nasserts that here ― ‗willfully‘ meant an intent to do a further act or achieve a future\nconsequence, i.e., promoting, furthering, or assisting felonious criminal conduct\nby fellow gang members through active participation.‖ ―Active participation,‖ the\nAttorney General continues, was defined as ―devot[ing] all or a substantial part of\n[one‘s] time or efforts to the criminal street gang.‖ Thus, she contends, the court\n―adequately instructed the jury that ‗willfully‘ meant an intent to do a further act\nor achieve a future consequence beyond the charged murder, i.e., specific intent.‖\nBut the trial court here defined ―[f]elonious criminal conduct‖ as including\n―murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon,‖ and there is a reasonable likelihood\nthe jury understood this language to refer to the convictions of Figueroa and\nMartinez for murder and aggravated assault, not the murders charged in this case.\nThus, regardless of the meaning of the word ―willfully,‖ the court‘s instructions\ndid not require the jury to decide whether the murders charged in this case were\ncommitted with the requisite specific intent.\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\f     The Attorney General asserts that the trial court‘s instruction told the jury\nthat ―there must be proof that the [defendant] ‗aided and abetted‘ a fellow gang\nmember in committing the murder,‖ and that the ―mental state required for\nliability as an aider and abettor is ‗specific intent.‘ ‖ The Attorney General is\nwrong. The court instructed the jury that the gang crime contained several\nelements that ―must be proved,‖ one of which was that the defendant ―aided and\nabetted a member of that gang in committing the crimes of murder and assault\nwith [a] deadly weapon.‖ As previously explained (see p. 47, ante), this language\nappears to refer to the murder and assault with a deadly weapon convictions of\nFigueroa and Martinez, not to the murders in this case. Thus, there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury construed the instruction as not requiring it to find that\ndefendants committed the charged murders with the specific intent to promote,\nfurther, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members. (See People v.\nJennings (2010) 50 Cal.4th 616, 676-677 [evaluating trial court error in omitting\nthe actus reas requirement of the torture-murder special-circumstance by assessing\nthe instructions as a whole to determine ― ‗if there was a reasonable likelihood the\njury applied the challenged instruction in an impermissible manner‘ ‖].)\n     We therefore conclude the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the gang\nenhancement, and turn to the issue of prejudice, which is a question of state law.\n(People v. Sengpadychith (2001) 26 Cal.4th 316, 320-321, 327.)6 To determine\n\n6      Recently, in Alleyne v. United States (June 17, 2013, No. 11-9335) __ U.S.\n__, __ [2013 U.S. Lexis 4543, at pp. *8-*9, *15-*16], the United States Supreme\nCourt held that the federal Constitution‘s Sixth Amendment entitles a defendant to\na jury trial, with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof, as to ―any fact\nthat increases the mandatory minimum‖ sentence for a crime. But because the\ngang enhancements on which the trial court here misinstructed the jury did not\nincrease the mandatory minimum sentence for the murders committed by\ndefendants, Alleyne does not alter our conclusion that the court‘s instructional\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          49\n\fwhether the error was prejudicial under state law, we must assess whether it is\nreasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendants would have been\nreached had the jury been correctly instructed, examining the entire record,\n― ‗including the facts and the instructions, the arguments of counsel, any\ncommunications from the jury during deliberations, and the entire verdict.‘ ‖\n(People v. Wims (1995) 10 Cal.4th 293, 315, overruled on other grounds in\nSengpadychith, supra, at p. 326, quoting People v. Guiton (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116,\n1130.)\n      Here, the trial court did not instruct the jury on any element required under\nsection 186.22(b)(1). Thus, the jury was not instructed that to find the\nenhancement allegations true, it must find that defendants committed the murders\n―for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street\ngang‖ (§ 186.22(b)(1)). Nor was it instructed that it must find that defendants\ncommitted the murders ―with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nerror violated only state law. In October 1998, when the murders in this case were\ncommitted, the finding of a gang enhancement as to a felony punishable by\nimprisonment for life resulted in the defendant being ineligible for parole until\nserving ―a minimum of 15 calendar years‖ in prison. (Former § 186.22,\nsubd. (b)(4); as amended by Stats. 1997, ch. 500, § 2, p. 3125.) By contrast, the\ncrime to which the gang enhancements apply here — first degree murder — was\npunishable by death, by imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, or\nby a prison term of ―25 years to life‖ (§ 190, subd. (a)), for which the defendant\nwas ineligible for parole before serving a minimum of 25 years in prison (§ 190,\nsubd. (e); Stats. 1997, ch. 413, §§ 1, 4, pp. 2756, 2758, added by Prop. 222, as\napproved by voters, Primary Elec. (June 2, 1998) eff. June 3, 1998). Thus, the\ngang enhancement‘s mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years did not increase\nthe statutory minimum sentence for the murders. As a result, the trial court‘s\ninstructional error as to the gang enhancement did not violate defendants‘ Sixth\nAmendment right to jury trial.\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\fany criminal conduct by gang members.‖ (Ibid.) Furthermore, as we have\nexplained, no other instruction addressed these elements.\n       The most important difference between the gang enhancement alleged\nagainst defendants and the gang crime on which they were instructed is that,\nunlike the gang crime, the gang enhancement can be found true only if the\nunderlying felony to which the enhancement applies — here, the two murders\ncommitted by defendants — is itself gang related. (See People v. Livingston\n(2012) 53 Cal.4th 1145, 1170 [―[T]he enhancement applies ‗only if the crime is\n―gang related.‖ ‘ [Citation.] ‗Not every crime committed by gang members is\nrelated to a gang.‘ ‖].) Both defendants in this case were indisputably members of\na criminal street gang (the West Side Wilmas), but, as discussed below, the\nevidence did not clearly show that the murders were gang related.\n       The prosecution theorized that the murders were gang related because they\nwere racially motivated. Los Angeles Police Officer Julie Rodriguez, testifying as\na gang expert who specialized in the West Side Wilmas gang, explained that in her\nopinion the West Side Wilmas ―don‘t care for African Americans living in‖ their\nterritory, and that ―they don‘t want any African Americans to share the\nneighborhood with them.‖ Defendants, in her view, believed that ―eliminating\nAfrican Americans within their community‖ would ―better the gang,‖ which had\nan ―unwritten rule‖ that gang members must take advantage of ―any opportunity\nthat they have . . . to attack an African American.‖\n       The prosecution presented considerable evidence that the murders were\nracially motivated: Prosecution witnesses testified that both defendants had\ndescribed the victims after the murders with words strongly suggesting prejudice\nagainst African-Americans, and that shortly after the murders defendant Satele\nsaid that defendants had been ―out looking for niggers.‖ The jury, however,\nrejected the prosecution‘s theory of a racially motivated killing, because it found\n\n                                         51\n\fspecial circumstance allegations that defendants intentionally killed the victims\nbecause of their race not to be true. By rejecting this theory, the jury implicitly\nrejected the prosecution‘s theory — described in the previous paragraph — that\nthe killings were gang related because they were racially motivated.\n       Prosecution witness Ernie Vasquez testified that defendant Nunez told him\nthat Nunez had been driving down the street when one of the victims ―looked at\nhim wrong,‖ so Nunez ―turned back around and blasted‖ the victim. This\ntestimony, if credited by the jury, could have caused it to conclude that the\nmurders were not gang-related, racially motivated killings. Thus, if the jury had\nbeen properly instructed that it could find the gang enhancements true only if it\nfound that defendants committed the murders ―for the benefit of, at the direction\nof, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to\npromote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members‖\n(§ 186.22(b)(1)), the jury might well have found the gang enhancement allegations\nnot to be true.\n       Because, for the reasons described above, there is ―serious doubt as to\nwhether the error has affected the result‖ (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818,\n837), the trial court‘s instructional error pertaining to the gang enhancement\nallegations was prejudicial. We therefore vacate the gang enhancement findings\nfor each defendant.\n\n           5. Challenge to firearm use enhancement true findings\n     Defendants contend that we must vacate the jury‘s true findings on the\nsentence enhancement allegations for personal firearm use, because those findings\ndepended on the jury first finding true the gang enhancement allegations, on which\nthe jury was erroneously instructed. (See pt. II.B.4, ante.) We agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\f     As to each defendant, the amended information alleged firearm use\nenhancements under former section 12022.53‘s subdivision (d) (section\n12022.53(d)) for both murders.7 The trial court instructed the jury that the\n―allegation pursuant to Penal Code section 12022.53(d) applies to any person\ncharged as a principal in the commission of an offense, when a violation of Penal\nCode section 12022.53(d) and 186.22(b) are pled and proved.‖ During closing\nargument to the jury, when discussing the firearm use allegations, the prosecutor\nsaid: ―I told you . . . that I did not prove to you which of the two defendants\npersonally used a gun. So you‘re going to say, ‗I‘m going to find that allegation\nnot true, because [the prosecutor] did not prove who personally shot the gun.‘ But\nif you look in that instruction . . . there‘s a paragraph that . . . says . . . that gang\nmembers are vicariously liable. They are all liable for that personal use if that gun\nhas been intentionally discharged and proximately caused death and there is a\ngang allegation that has been pled and proven. I‘ve told you I pled and proved\n\n7      At the time of the murders, section 12022.53 provided in relevant part:\n        ―(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who is\nconvicted of a felony specified in subdivision (a) [murder is a specified\nfelony], . . ., and who in the commission of that felony intentionally and personally\ndischarged a firearm and proximately caused great bodily injury, . . . or death, to\nany person other than an accomplice, shall be punished by a term of imprisonment\nof 25 years to life in the state prison, which shall be imposed in addition and\nconsecutive to the punishment prescribed for that felony.\n     ―(e)(1) The enhancements specified in this section shall apply to any person\ncharged as a principal in the commission of an offense that includes an allegation\npursuant to this section when a violation of both this section and subdivision (b) of\nSection 186.22 are pled and proved.\n      ―(2) An enhancement for participation in a criminal street gang pursuant to\nChapter 11 (commencing with Section 186.20) of Title 7 of Part 1, shall not be\nimposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this\nsubdivision, unless the person personally used or personally discharged a firearm\nin the commission of the offense.‖ (As amended by Stats. 1998, ch. 936, § 19; see\nid., §§ 19.5, 27, 36, pp. 6899-6900, 6919, 6922.)\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\fthat, because I proved that Dominic Martinez, Ruben Figueroa — we had Julie\nRodriguez. So that gang allegation is proven. Because of that gang allegation,\nthey are both liable for that personal use of the gun. So I don‘t want that word\n‗personal‘ to throw you off. When you go back there and it says, ‗We, the jury,\nfind the allegation that the defendants personally, intentionally used a firearm . . .\nto be true or not true,‘ please circle the true.‖\n     The trial court‘s instructions and the prosecutor‘s argument relieved the jury\nof the obligation to determine who personally used the murder weapon if it found\ntrue the gang enhancement allegations under section 186.22(b)(1). Although the\njury may have found that one or both defendants personally used the murder\nweapon, the instructions permitted the jury to simply conclude that because it had\nfound the gang enhancement allegations to be true, it did not need to decide who\npersonally used the weapon; indeed, the prosecutor specifically urged the jury to\nadopt this approach. Thus, we cannot tell whether the jury found the section\n12022.53(d) allegations true because it found true the section 186.22(b)(1)\nallegations (a legally invalid theory because the jury was misinstructed on the\nelements of the gang enhancement allegations) or because it found that each\ndefendant personally shot the two victims (a legally valid theory). We therefore\nvacate the firearm use findings as to both defendants. (See People v. Chun (2009)\n45 Cal.4th 1172, 1203 [―to find the error harmless, a reviewing court must\nconclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury based its verdict on a legally\nvalid theory‖]; People v. Green (1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 69, 71, 74 [kidnapping\nconviction reversed and special circumstance finding vacated when this court\ncould not tell whether the jury based its verdict on a legally invalid theory]; see\nalso People v. Guiton, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 1128 [―cases involving a ‗legally\ninadequate theory‘ ‖ are ―subject to the rule generally requiring reversal‖].) As a\nresult, we need not address defendants‘ further arguments that the trial court\n\n                                            54\n\fmisinstructed the jury on liability under section 12022.53(d), and that the jury‘s\nfindings on the firearm use allegations were factually inconsistent.\n\n           6. Instruction on culpability of an aider and abettor\n     The trial court instructed the jury: ―Persons who are involved in committing\na crime are referred to as principals in that crime. Each principal, regardless of the\nextent or manner of participation is equally guilty. Principals include: those who\ndirectly and actively commit the act constituting the crime, or those who aid and\nabet the commission of the crime.‖ (Italics added; see CALJIC No. 3.00.)\n     Relying on People v. McCoy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1111 (McCoy), and People v.\nConcha (2009) 47 Cal.4th 653 (Concha), both defendants contend that the use of\nthe term ―equally guilty‖ in the trial court‘s instruction was erroneous because an\naider and abettor‘s culpability, although based on the acts of the principals, is also\nbased on the aider and abettor‘s own mental state. Therefore, they assert, the\nculpability of an aider or abettor can sometimes be either greater or less than, but\nnot equal to, the culpability of the direct perpetrator, and the jury should have been\nso instructed. Defendants are not entitled to reversal on this ground.\n     In McCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at page 1120, we observed that by making\n―aiders and abettors liable for their accomplices‘ actions as well as their own,‖ the\naider and abettor doctrine ―obviates the necessity to decide who was the aider and\nabettor and who the direct perpetrator or to what extent each played which role.‖\nWe noted that ―outside of the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider\nand abettor‘s mental state must be at least that required of the direct perpetrator.‖\n(Id. at p. 1118.) When the crime is murder, McCoy said, the ―aider and abettor\nmust know and share the murderous intent of the actual perpetrator.‖ (Ibid.)\nBecause an aider and abettor‘s ―guilt is based on a combination of the direct\nperpetrator‘s acts and the aider and abettor‘s own acts and own mental state‖ (id. at\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fp. 1117), McCoy also held that ―sometimes‖ an ―aider and abettor may be guilty of\ngreater homicide-related offenses than those the actual perpetrator committed‖\nbecause of ―defenses or extenuating circumstances . . . that are personal to the\nactual perpetrator and do not apply to the aider and abettor.‖ (Id. at p. 1114.)8 In\nConcha, two codefendants and an accomplice tried to murder a man during an\napparent robbery, and the man responded by killing the accomplice. (Concha,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 658.) We held that each defendant could be liable for the\nfirst degree murder of the accomplice under the ―provocative act murder doctrine‖\nonly ―if the defendant personally acted willfully, deliberately, and with\npremeditation during the attempted murder.‖ (Ibid., italics added.)\n     Here, however, neither defendant asserts a defense theory or points to\nextenuating circumstances that might have led the jury to find that one defendant‘s\nindividual culpability was less than that of the other defendant, nor does the\nevidence at trial suggest any such defense or circumstances. Rather, defendants\nsimply speculate that they ―may have had different levels of culpability.‖ Under\nthe circumstances, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was confused or\nmisled by the trial court‘s instruction that the aider and abettor and the direct\nperpetrator were ―equally guilty.‖\n\n\n8      Following our decision in McCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th 1111, CALJIC No. 3.00\nwas modified for cases in which there is evidence that the guilt of the aider and\nabettor might be different from that of the direct perpetrator. In those\ncircumstances, the current instruction substitutes the language ―guilty of a crime‖\nfor the language ―equally guilty,‖ and further provides: ―When the crime charged\nis [either] [murder] [or] [attempted murder] . . . , the aider and abettor‘s guilt is\ndetermined by the combined acts of all the participants as well as that person‘s\nown mental state. If the aider and abettor‘s mental state is more culpable than that\nof the actual perpetrator, that person‘s guilt may be greater than that of the actual\nperpetrator. Similarly, the aider and abettor‘s guilt may be less than the\nperpetrator‘s, if the aider and abettor has a less culpable mental state.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f           7. Challenge to multiple-murder special-circumstance instruction\n     The trial court instructed the jury that if it found that either defendant was an\naccomplice to the murders but was not the actual killer, or if it was unable to\ndecide whether a defendant was the actual killer or an aider and abettor, it could\nnot find the multiple-murder special-circumstance allegations true as to that\ndefendant unless he acted with either one of two mental states: (1) the ―defendant\nwith the intent to kill aided, abetted, counseled, commanded[,] induced, solicited,\nrequested, or assisted any actor in the commission of the murder in the first\ndegree‖ or (2) the defendant ―with reckless indifference to human life and as a\nmajor participant aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced[,] solicited[,]\nrequested, or assisted in the commission of the crime of Penal Code section\n190.2(a)(3) . . . which resulted in the death of a human being.‖ Both defendants\ncontend that the trial court prejudicially erred in giving the second portion of this\ninstruction because it permitted the jury to find the multiple-murder special-\ncircumstance allegations true as to a defendant who was not the actual killer\nwithout finding that the defendant acted with the intent to kill.9 We agree that the\n\n9     This was the instruction given by the trial court on the multiple-murder\nspecial-circumstance allegations: ―If you find a defendant in this case guilty of\nmurder of the first degree, you must then determine if one or more of the\nfollowing special circumstances are true or not true . . . . Unless an intent to kill is\nan[] element of a special circumstance, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the defendant actually killed a human being, you need not find that the\ndefendant intended to kill in order to find the special circumstance to be true. If\nyou find that the defendant was not the actual killer of . . . a human being, or if\nyou are unable to decide whether the defendant [w]as the actual killer, or an aider\nand abettor or co-conspirator, you cannot find the special circumstance to be true\nas to that defendant unless . . . [you are] satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nsuch defendant with the intent to kill aided, abetted, counseled, commanded[,]\ninduced, solicited, requested, or assisted any actor in the commission of the\nmurder in the first degree, or with reckless indifference to human life and as a\nmajor participant aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced[,] solicited[,]\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          57\n\ftrial court misinstructed the jury as to the intent requirement for aiders and\nabettors, but we conclude the error was harmless.\n      When there is evidence from which a jury could base its convictions for\nmultiple counts of murder on the theory that the defendant was guilty as an aider\nand abettor, and not as the actual perpetrator, the trial court must instruct the jury\nthat to find true a multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation as to that\ndefendant, it must find that the defendant intended to kill the murder victims.\n(§ 190.2, subds. (b)-(c); People v. Hardy (1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 192 (Hardy).) A\nmurderer who was not the actual killer and who lacked the intent to kill, but acted\n―with reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant,‖ can be\nsubject to a punishment of either death or life imprisonment without the possibility\nof parole only when the prosecution alleges, as a special circumstance, that the\nmurder occurred in the commission of certain felonies specified in section 190.2‘s\nsubdivision (a)(17). (§ 190.2, subd. (d).) Contrary to the trial court‘s instruction\nto the jury here, this rule does not apply to the multiple-murder special\ncircumstance. An erroneous instruction on the intent to kill element of a special\ncircumstance, however, ―does not require reversal if a reviewing court concludes\n. . . that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.‖ (Hardy, at p. 192; see\nPeople v. Garrison (1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 789 (Garrison).) We so conclude here.\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nrequested, or assisted in the commission of the crime of Penal Code section\n190.2(a)(3) . . . which resulted in the death of a human being, namely Edward\nRobinson and Renesha Ann Fuller. A defendant acts with reckless indifference to\nhuman life when that defendant knows or is aware that his acts involve a grave\nrisk of death to an[] innocent human being.‖ (Italics added.)\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\f     In Hardy, supra, 2 Cal.4th 86, this court held that the trial court‘s failure to\ninstruct on the intent to kill element of the multiple-murder special-circumstance\nallegation in that case was harmless because the court instructed the jury that if the\ndefendant was not the actual killer, ― ‗it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat he intentionally aided [and] abetted . . . the actual killer in the commission of\nthe murder in the first degree.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 192.) In addition, in Hardy, the jury\nfound true the financial-gain special-circumstance allegation, which expressly\nrequired it to find the killing was intentional. We observed that ―in combination,\nthese instructions required the jury to find either that [the defendant] himself was\nthe actual killer, or that he intentionally aided the actual killer in an intentional\nkilling.‖ (Ibid.)\n     Likewise in Garrison, supra, 47 Cal.3d 746, the trial court failed to instruct\nthe jury on the intent to kill requirement for a multiple-murder special-\ncircumstance finding as to an aider and abettor. (Id. at p. 789.) We held the error\nwas harmless because the jury also found true a witness-killing special-\ncircumstance allegation, which required a finding that the witness was killed\nintentionally. (Id. at p. 790.) We also noted that the deficiencies in the aiding and\nabetting instructions were ameliorated because the defendant at trial denied he in\nany way aided in the killing, leaving ―no way for the jury to find that he ‗aided‘\nthe killing only ‗accidentally‘ or ‗unintentionally.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 790; see id. at\npp. 776-777.)\n     Here, as in Hardy, supra, 2 Cal.4th 86, and Garrison, supra, 47 Cal.3d 746,\nthe jury necessarily found under other properly given instructions that any\ndefendant that it convicted of murder on a theory of aiding and abetting possessed\nthe intent to kill. The instructions here permitted the jury to convict a defendant of\nmurder as an aider and abettor only if it found that the defendant, ―with knowledge\nof the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator‖ (i.e., to kill the victims), and ―with the\n\n                                           59\n\fintent or purpose of committing or encouraging or facilitating the commission of\nthe crime‖ (i.e., the killing of the victims), ―by act or advice aid[ed], promote[ed],\nencourage[d] or instigate[d] the commission of the crime.‖ The trial court further\ninstructed the jury that aiding and abetting liability was not demonstrated by\n―[m]ere presence at the scene of the crime which does not itself assist the\ncommission of the crime,‖ or ―[m]ere knowledge . . . that a crime is being\ncommitted and a failure to prevent it.‖ These instructions told the jury that an\naider and abettor‘s murder conviction could not be based on mere knowledge of\nthe perpetrator‘s intent to kill; rather, the jury was also required to find that the\naider and abettor shared that purpose or intent. (See People v. Beeman (1984) 35\nCal.3d 547, 560 [―an aider and abettor will ‗share‘ the perpetrator‘s specific intent\nwhen he or she knows the full extent of the perpetrator‘s criminal purpose and\ngives aid or encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating the\nperpetrator‘s commission of the crime‖].)\n     The evidence at trial demonstrated that murder victims Fuller and Robinson\nsuffered their fatal injuries when they were each hit by multiple shots fired in a\ndriveby shooting by a perpetrator using an AK-47-type assault rifle loaded with\narmor-penetrating bullets. These circumstances demonstrate that the actual\nperpetrator acted with the intent to kill, and did not kill accidentally or\ninadvertently. As previously noted (see pp. 55-56, ante), defendants do not assert,\nand the evidence at trial does not reveal, any defense or extenuating circumstances\nthat might have warranted a finding by the jury that one defendant‘s individual\nculpability was less than that of the other defendant. On these facts, and given the\ninstructions described in the previous paragraph, the jury here must necessarily\nhave found that any defendant that it convicted of murder as an accomplice acted\nwith the intent to kill.\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\f           8. Trial court’s failure to instruct on its own motion on implied\n              malice murder\n     The trial court instructed the jury that to constitute murder a killing must be\nunlawful and done with malice aforethought, and it defined both express and\nimplied malice. The court then instructed the jury on three forms of first degree\nmurder: premeditated and deliberate murder, murder by knowing use of armor-\npenetrating ammunition, and murder by intentionally discharging a firearm from a\nmotor vehicle. The court further instructed the jury that ―murder of the second\ndegree is . . . the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought . . . if\n[the] perpetrator intended unlawfully to kill a human being but the evidence is\ninsufficient to prove deliberation and premeditation.‖\n     Both defendants argue that, in addition to instructing the jury on one type of\nsecond degree murder — an unlawful killing with intent to kill, but without\npremeditation and deliberation — the trial court, on its own initiative, should also\nhave instructed on a second type of second degree murder — an unlawful killing\nwith implied malice. They point out that second degree murder is a lesser offense\nnecessarily included within the crime of murder, and that a trial court‘s obligation\nto instruct on lesser included offenses includes the duty to instruct on every form\nof the lesser included offense that is supported by substantial evidence. (People\nv. Breverman (1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 162 [―a trial court errs if it fails to instruct,\nsua sponte, on all theories of a lesser included offense which find substantial\nsupport in the evidence‖].) Here, they argue, there was substantial evidence that\nthey unlawfully killed victims Robinson and Fuller while acting with implied\nmalice, and the trial court therefore erred by failing to instruct on this type of\nsecond degree murder.\n     We find no error. When a defendant is charged with murder and the\nprosecution proceeds on the theory that the killing was an intentional,\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\fpremeditated killing, the trial court must instruct on an implied malice theory of\nsecond degree murder only if the record contains evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude that the defendant killed without express malice,\nbut with implied malice. (People v. Bunyard (1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1233.) Here,\nthe record contained no such evidence. The prosecution presented strong evidence\nthat both defendants acted with intent to kill, and therefore with express malice:\nThe victims were shot with armor-piercing shells fired from an assault-type rifle,\neach victim was hit multiple times (although one shot may have hit both victims),\nand each defendant made a statement after the murders that implied he had acted\nwith intent to kill. (See pt. II.B.7., ante.) Neither defendant presented evidence\nthat he acted with implied malice or any less culpable mental state; instead, each\npresented evidence tending to show that he did not participate in the murders.\n(See pt. I.A.2., ante.) Thus, the evidence showed that each defendant was guilty\nof murder with express malice or not guilty at all, and the trial court therefore had\nno duty to instruct on an implied malice theory of second degree murder.\n     Both defendants here argue that in not instructing the jury on second degree\nmurder resulting from an unlawful killing by implied malice, the trial court\nviolated their right to due process under the federal Constitution‘s Fourteenth\nAmendment by forcing the jury to make an ―all or nothing‖ choice between first\ndegree murder and acquittal. (See Beck v. Alabama (1980) 447 U.S. 625, 637;\nPeople v. Benavides (2005) 35 Cal.4th 69, 103.) Not so. The jury was instructed\non another form of second degree murder — second degree murder resulting from\nan unlawful killing by a perpetrator acting with intent to kill — and accordingly\ndid not have an all-or-nothing choice in evaluating defendants‘ culpability. (See\nSchad v. Arizona (1991) 501 U.S. 624, 646-648 [second degree murder instruction\nsufficient to ensure verdict‘s reliability]; Benavides, at p. 103.)\n\n\n\n                                           62\n\f           9. Refusal to give proposed defense instruction\n     Defendants argue that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury:\n―Merely being in the company of a person believed to have committed a felony is\nnot sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict.‖ We find no error. Declining defendants‘\nrequest to give this instruction, the trial court instead instructed the jury that\n―[m]ere presence at the scene of the crime which does not itself assist the\ncommission of the crime does not amount to aiding and abetting,‖ and that ―[m]ere\nknowledge . . . that a crime is being committed and a failure to prevent it does\nnot . . . amount to aiding and abetting.‖ This instruction conveyed the essence of\nthe instruction proposed by defendants.\n\n           10. Failure to give limiting instruction\n     The trial court instructed the jury: ―If you find that a defendant attempted to\nor did persuade a witness to testify falsely or attempted to or did fabricate\nevidence to be produced at the trial, that conduct may be considered by you as a\ncircumstance tending to show a consciousness of guilt. However, that conduct is\nnot sufficient by itself to prove guilt and its weight and significance, if any, are for\nyou to decide.‖ (See CALJIC No. 2.04.) It also instructed: ―If you find that an[]\neffort to procure false or fabricated evidence was made by another person for the\ndefendant‘s benefit, you may not consider that effort as tending to show[] the\ndefendant‘s consciousness of guilt unless you also find that the defendant\nauthorized that effort. If you find defendant authorized the effort, that conduct is\nnot sufficient by itself to prove guilt, and its weight and significance, if any, are\nfor you to decide.‖ (See CALJIC No. 2.05.)\n     Defendant Satele objected to both instructions. Contending that the\nprosecution had presented no evidence that he had tried to persuade a witness to\ntestify falsely or to fabricate evidence, he asked the trial court to modify CALJIC\nNo. 2.04 to state that it applied only to codefendant Nunez. The court refused.\n\n\n                                           63\n\f     Defendant Satele contends that the trial court erred by giving the two\ninstructions without the modification he requested. We disagree. The first\ninstruction merely told the jury that if it found that either defendant had tried,\nsuccessfully or unsuccessfully, to persuade a witness to testify falsely, or had tried\nto fabricate evidence to be produced at trial, such conduct could indicate\nconsciousness of guilt but was itself insufficient to prove guilt, and the jury was\n―to determine the weight and significance assigned to such behavior.‖ (People v.\nJackson (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164, 1224.) Similarly, the second instruction\nexplained that the jury could not consider a third party‘s efforts to procure false\nevidence as indicating a defendant‘s consciousness of guilt unless the jury also\nfound that the defendant had authorized that effort; it also clarified that such\nauthorization was insufficient to prove a defendant‘s guilt, but the jury was to\ndetermine the weight and significance of the evidence. These instructions told the\njury to infer that a particular defendant had a consciousness of guilt only if that\ndefendant had engaged in the described conduct. Thus, if — as defendant Satele\ncontends — the prosecution presented no evidence that he tried to procure false\ntestimony or to fabricate evidence, and no evidence that he authorized anyone else\nto do so, we presume that the jury concluded that the instructions did not apply to\nhim and it should not infer a consciousness of his guilt. (See Jackson, at p. 1225\n[― ‗[A]t worst, there was no evidence to support the instruction and . . . it was\nsuperfluous.‘ ‖].)\n\n           11. Error in allowing jury to make special circumstance findings as to\n               each count\n     Defendants contend that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to make\nmultiple-murder special-circumstance findings as to each count of murder.\n(§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3).) The Attorney General concedes the error. We agree, and\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\fvacate one multiple-murder special-circumstance finding for each defendant.\n(Hardy, supra, 2 Cal.4th at pp. 191, 216.)\n\n           12. Effect of erroneous guilt phase instructions and duplicative\n               multiple-murder special-circumstance findings on judgments of\n               death\n     Defendants assert that the duplicative multiple-murder special-circumstance\nfindings, considered in conjunction with the trial court‘s instructional errors\npertaining to the gang enhancement (see part II.B.4., ante), the firearm use\nenhancement (see part II.B.5., ante), and the multiple-murder special-circumstance\nallegations (see part II.B.7., ante), affected the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations,\nrequiring reversal of the judgment of death. We disagree. These errors had no\neffect on the admissibility of any evidence presented to the jury at either the guilt\nor the penalty phase of trial, and hence do not require reversal of the judgment of\ndeath. (See Brown v. Sanders (2006) 546 U.S. 212, 223-224; People v. Bonilla\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 313, 334 [second special circumstance ―was superfluous for\npurposes of death eligibility and did not alter the universe of facts and\ncircumstances to which the jury could accord . . . weight‖]; People v. Marshall\n(1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 855 [―the jury‘s consideration of duplicative multiple-\nmurder special circumstances is harmless where, as here, the jury knows the\nnumber of murders on which the special circumstances are based‖].)\n\n           13. Jury’s alleged failure to find degree of crimes charged in murder\n               counts 1 and 2\n     Defendants contend that the jury failed to find the degree of the murders, and\nthat by operation of section 1157, both murders are therefore of the second degree.\nWe disagree.\n     Section 1157 provides: ―Whenever a defendant is convicted of a crime or\nattempt to commit a crime which is distinguished into degrees, the jury . . . must\n\n\n\n                                          65\n\ffind the degree of the crime or attempted crime of which he is guilty. Upon the\nfailure of the jury . . . to so determine, the degree of the crime or attempted crime\nof which the defendant is guilty, shall be deemed to be of the lesser degree.‖\nHere, the jury‘s signed verdict forms found defendants ―guilty of the crime of\nwillful, deliberate, premeditated murder, in violation of section 187(a) of the Penal\nCode‖ as to each charge of murder. Because each of these findings is equivalent\nto a finding of first degree murder, section 1157 is not implicated. (People v. San\nNicolas (2004) 34 Cal.4th 614, 635 (San Nicolas) [holding that a signed verdict\nform similar to the one used here was tantamount to a finding of first degree\nmurder].) We reject defendant Satele‘s invitation to revisit our conclusion in San\nNicolas.\n     We further reject defendant Satele‘s contention that our reliance on San\nNicolas, supra, 34 Cal.4th at page 635, violates his right ―to due process of law . . .\nand to be free of ex post facto application of the laws‖ because we decided San\nNicolas after he committed the murders. Because Satele challenges our retroactive\napplication of a judicial decision construing section 1157 and does not challenge\nsection 1157 itself, his claim is more properly characterized as invoking due\nprocess, not the ex post facto clause. (People v. Brown (2004) 33 Cal.4th 382,\n394.) In any event, application of our holding in San Nicolas to this case does not\nviolate Satele‘s rights under either provision because that holding did not attach\ncriminality to a prior act that was innocent when done, impose a greater\npunishment for a crime than was prescribed at the time of its commission, or alter\nthe degree or measure of proof necessary to convict from that which was required\nat the time a crime was committed. (Brown, at p. 394.)\n     Defendant Satele summarily asserts that application of our holding in San\nNicolas, supra, 34 Cal.4th at page 635, to his case violates his right to equal\nprotection of the law. He offers no argument and cites no authority, however, in\n\n                                          66\n\fsupport of this claim, which we therefore reject. (See People v. Stanley (1995) 10\nCal.4th 764, 793 [reviewing court need not consider claim that is accompanied by\nneither argument nor authority].)\n\n           14. Claim that guilt and penalty verdicts were returned by a jury of\n               fewer than 12 sworn jurors\n     After 12 trial jurors were selected by the parties, the trial court administered\nthis statutorily required oath (Code Civ. Proc., § 232, subd. (b)): ―You, and each\nof you, do understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now\npending before this court and render a true verdict according to the evidence\npresented to you and the instructions of this court?‖ The jurors collectively\nresponded, ―I will.‖ Shortly thereafter, six alternate jurors were selected, and the\ncourt inquired: ―You understand and agree that you will act as an alternate juror\nin the case now pending before this court by listening to the evidence and\ninstructions of this court, and will act as a trial juror when called upon to do so?‖\nThe alternate jurors collectively responded, ―I will.‖ The jurors and alternate\njurors were then excused for the weekend, after which several persons, including\nJuror No. 5, spoke to the court and counsel privately.\n     The next Monday, the trial court excused Juror No. 5 for cause, and replaced\nher with an alternate. The court then read the amended information, and told the\njury: ―Members and alternate members of the jury, you have been selected and\nsworn as jurors and alternate jurors. I shall now instruct you as to your basic\nfunctions, duty and conduct. At the conclusion of the case I will give you further\ninstructions on the law. . . . You must base the decision you make on the facts and\nthe law. First, you must determine the facts from the evidence received in the trial\nand not from any other source. A ‗fact‘ is something proved by the evidence or by\nstipulation. . . . Second, you must apply the law that I state to you to the facts as\n\n\n\n\n                                          67\n\fyou determine them, and in this way arrive at your verdict and any findings you\nare instructed to include in your verdict.‖\n     During the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations, the trial court replaced Jurors\nNos. 9 and 10 with alternate jurors. At no time did the court administer to the\nthree alternate jurors who replaced Jurors Nos. 5, 9, and 10 the oath described in\nCode of Civil Procedure section 232‘s subdivision (b), which it had administered\nat the beginning of trial to the other sitting jurors.\n     Both defendants argue that the guilt and penalty verdicts were returned by a\njury of fewer than 12 sworn jurors, because the three alternates who served on the\njury were never properly sworn as they did not take the same oath given to the\njurors already selected. Defendants rely on section 1089 and Code of Civil\nProcedure section 234, each of which provides in relevant part, ―The alternate\njurors shall be seated so as to have equal power and facilities for seeing and\nhearing the proceedings in the case, and shall take the same oath as the jurors\nalready selected . . . .‖ (Italics added.)\n     We agree with defendants that the trial court erred in failing to administer the\nproper oath to the alternate jurors when they were sworn, but we conclude there\nwas no prejudice. In the presence of the prospective jurors later chosen as\nalternate jurors, the trial court administered the oath required by Code of Civil\nProcedure section 232‘s subdivision (b) to the jurors who had been selected to\ndecide the case. A short time later, the alternate jurors took an oath that each of\nthem would ―act as an alternate juror in the case now pending before this court by\nlistening to the evidence and instructions of this court, and . . . act as a trial juror\nwhen called upon to do so.‖ Because the alternates had heard the oath taken by\nthe 12 jurors selected to try the case, they were aware that to ―act as a trial juror\nwhen called upon to do so‖ meant that they must comply with the oath set forth in\nCode of Civil Procedure section 232‘s subdivision (b) — that is, to ―try the cause\n\n                                             68\n\fnow pending before this court and render a true verdict according only to the\nevidence presented to you and the instructions of this court.‖ The trial court\nemphasized these principles in the opening instructions given to both the jurors\nand the alternates, explaining that the jury must reach its verdict by determining\nthe facts from ―the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source,‖\nand by applying the law as stated by the court to those facts. The error was\ntherefore harmless. (See People v. Carter (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1175-1176\n[concluding there was no prejudice when the trial court erroneously failed to\nadminister the oath of truthfulness to certain prospective jurors before voir dire];\nPeople v. Lewis (2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 630.)\n\n       C. Penalty Phase Issues\n\n           1. Discharge of Juror No. 10\n\n                a. Factual background\n     On Thursday, June 29, 2000, during the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations,\nthe trial court received this note from the jury: ―We are at an impasse on the\nverdict 10-2, what and how do we go on? Need answer ASAP.‖ About\n35 minutes later, Juror No. 6, the foreperson, wrote the court another note saying:\n―Jury member #10 . . . stated that she had confided with her friend and mother and\nthat they sided with her doubts — Possibly replacing her would be appropriate.‖\nThe next day, the court and counsel spoke with Juror No. 6. The court read the\nnotes from the day before out loud and asked Juror No. 6, ―[W]hen did you\ndiscover that [Juror No. 10] had been talking to her mom?‖ Juror No. 6 replied,\n―She admitted [it] to us right at the table.‖\n     The trial court and counsel then questioned Juror No. 10, who said that after\nthe guilt phase deliberations she had ―confided with [her] friend and mother about\nissues relating to this case.‖ The court asked whether the discussions happened in\n\n\n                                           69\n\fthe penalty phase, and Juror No. 10 said, ―No.‖ The court asked, ―As you were\ndeliberating?‖ Juror No. 10 replied, ―No, it was after. It was the day that I turned\nit in, and it didn‘t sit right with me.‖ The court then said: ―I just want to make\nsure that because the jury‘s still what we call live and deliberating, I don‘t want\nyou to disclose anything relating to the deliberation process unless I instruct you to\ndo so.‖ The court asked if Juror No. 10 remembered when she had spoken to her\nmother and to her friend. Juror No. 10 said that the conversations occurred two\ndays earlier on Wednesday evening, and lasted about five minutes with her friend,\nand about a minute or two with her mother.\n     The court asked Juror No. 10 if she had described to her mother the vote she\nanticipated casting on the question of penalty. Juror No. 10 said she had not told\nher mother, but as to her friend, she ―would have to say yes.‖ The court asked if\nJuror No. 10 had told her friend ―what you‘re thinking about making —‖ Juror\nNo. 10 interrupted and said: ―No, no, no, no, no. We had already reached the\nverdict. Wednesday night we had reached the verdict.‖ The court said:\n―Obviously, there‘s no verdict because at this point in time there is no verdict\nreached. So you‘re still deliberating, in other words?‖ Juror No. 10 replied,\n―Yes.‖ The court said: ―You‘re still going through the process, and Thursday you\nwere going through the process as you were on Wednesday, and today you‘re\ngoing through the process, right?‖ Juror No. 10 replied, ―Yes.‖\n     Juror No. 10 said her friend had come over to see her on Wednesday night.\nShe explained: ―[The friend] saw that I was upset, and she asked me how was the\ncase going. I said oh, it‘s over with, you know. We‘re going to turn in the verdict\nin the morning, and she said okay, well, you know, that‘s really good; and I said,\nwell, you know, I guess it is. It just all depends on how you look at it; and she\nsays as long as it sits right with you, that‘s all that matters; and from there — it\nwasn‘t sitting right already when I got home.‖ Juror No. 10 did not tell her friend\n\n                                          70\n\f―what was not sitting right.‖ The friend asked what the jury had decided. When\nJuror No. 10 said she could not discuss it, the friend asked, ― ‗well did you go\n. . .,‘ ‖ and made gestures. (The record does not describe the gestures, but we infer\nfrom the testimony that she made ―thumbs up‖ and ―thumbs down‖ motions.) The\ntrial court asked Juror No. 10, ―One way or the other?‖ Juror No. 10 responded:\n―And when she went like this here (gesturing) and I just said yeah, to the one, and\nshe just said, ‗hmm, interesting,‘ ‖ and made a statement relating to views on the\ndeath penalty.\n     Also on Wednesday evening Juror No. 10 received a call from her mother.\nAt the end of the conversation, her mother asked, ― ‗So how is your case going?‘ ‖\nJuror No. 10 said, ―You know what, it‘s done,‖ and her mother said, ― ‗Well,\ngood.‘ ‖ Her mother then mentioned a political topic, and Juror No. 10 said,\n―Well . . . that has nothing to do with me . . . . I have some issues and some stuff\nthat I have to work out.‖ Her mother replied, ― ‗Well, just pray.‘ ‖ Juror No. 10\ndid not describe to her mother the ―issues‖ she had to ―work out.‖\n     The prosecutor asked the trial court to excuse Juror No. 10. Defendant\nNunez‘s counsel asked the court to determine whether the jury had reached a\nverdict on Wednesday night; he asserted that if a verdict had been reached, there\nwas no reason to excuse the juror. Defendant Satele‘s counsel also wanted to\nknow ―what was done Wednesday night,‖ and whether the court and counsel were\n―under a misguided belief that they were deliberating yesterday.‖\n     The trial court found that Juror No. 10 had committed misconduct and\ndischarged her. The court explained: ―The fact that the juror maybe believed that\nthere is a verdict, it is actually a taking of a vote. Jurors take several votes and\ncontinue deliberating. The only time that they have a verdict is when they sign the\nverdict form. The fact that they may have taken a vote, even if they‘re at an\nimpasse, [does] not mean there was a verdict. . . . [T]he only thing that she\n\n                                           71\n\fdisclosed to the jurors, as I understand from her statement, is that she said she\nconfided in her mother and a friend. . . . [T]his court finds based upon the juror‘s\ndemeanor, and also based upon the juror‘s comments, that there is misconduct on\nthe juror‘s part . . . [and] grounds for substituting an alternate.‖\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Section 1089 ―authorizes the trial court to discharge a juror at any time\nbefore or after the final submission of the case to the jury if, upon good cause, the\njuror is ‗found to be unable to perform his or her duty.‘ ‖ (People v. Bennett\n(2009) 45 Cal.4th 577, 621 (Bennett).) Whether to remove the juror is left to the\ndiscretion of the trial court, whose decision for removal is reviewed by ―asking\nwhether the grounds for such removal appear in the record as a demonstrable\nreality.‖ (People v. Thompson (2010) 49 Cal.4th 79, 137 (Thompson).)\n     Here, Juror No. 10 admitted telling her close friend that the jury would return\na verdict the next morning, the nature of that verdict, and her unease with the\nverdict, thus violating the court‘s admonition not to discuss the case with anyone\noutside the jury room. This was misconduct. (People v. Ledesma (2006) 39\nCal.4th 641, 743 (Ledesma) [juror who discussed the case with his wife committed\ndeliberate misconduct].) After the juror‘s statements, the friend expressed her\nviews on the death penalty, the very decision the juror had to make in the case.\n(See People v. Danks (2004) 32 Cal.4th 269, 309 (Danks) [juror who asked ―her\npastor about the Bible‘s stand on the very issue she was deliberating‖ committed\nmisconduct].) A ―judge may reasonably conclude that a juror who has violated\ninstructions to refrain from discussing the case . . . cannot be counted on to follow\ninstructions in the future‖ and is unable to perform her duty as a juror. (People v.\nDaniels (1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 865.) For these reasons, the trial court had good\ncause to discharge Juror No. 10.\n\n\n\n                                           72\n\f           2. Discharge of Juror No. 9\n\n               a. Factual background\n     On June 20, 2000, during the evidentiary portion of the penalty phase, Juror\nNo. 9 telephoned the trial court that she was two months pregnant, had a medical\nemergency, and was on her way to the hospital. Later that day, the court received\na note from Juror No. 9‘s physician stating that the juror was in severe pain with a\nhemorrhagic cyst of the right ovary, that she had been prescribed bed rest, and that\nshe would be unable to participate in jury duty for the next 48 to 72 hours. That\nafternoon, the court and counsel spoke with Juror No. 9‘s doctor. In the\nphysician‘s view, the juror would recover within 72 hours and could then return to\njury duty. The court then declared a recess until that time.\n     On July 3, 2000, during penalty phase deliberations, the trial court read to\ncounsel a note from Juror No. 9 that was dated July 2 (a Sunday). The note stated:\n―Your Honor, [¶] Respectfully, I am asking if I may be removed from this case. I\nfeel the high amount of stress this case created will be detrimental to the health of\nmy unborn child, as well as toward myself. Because I am considered high risk in\nthis pregnancy, I want to make sure I do everything possible to increase my\nchances of being able to carry this baby full term. [¶] I wish to thank you for your\ntime, effort, and compassion in the rendering of your decision.‖ The court asked\ncounsel whether it should inquire into the matter. The prosecutor favored an\ninquiry. Counsel for both defendants, however, objected to any inquiry into Juror\nNo. 9‘s ability to continue to serve because of her health.\n     The trial court and counsel then talked to Juror No. 9. She confirmed\nsending the note, and said she was three months pregnant. The court asked her\nwhy she considered the case as potentially detrimental to her health. Juror No. 9\nexplained that two years before the trial she had had a miscarriage when she was\nfive months pregnant, at a time when she was under a lot of stress at work. When\n\n\n                                         73\n\fthe court asked whether continued participation in deliberations would cause her\nstress, Juror No. 9 replied, ―Yes, sir.‖ To the court‘s inquiry whether it had\n―caused a great amount of stress,‖ Juror No. 9 replied, ―Yes, especially Friday.‖\nThe court asked, ―Do you believe that it would be in your best interests and the\nbest interests of your unborn child if you are excused from this case?‖ Juror No. 9\nsaid, ―Yes, sir.‖ The court asked: ―Based on your . . . health and your health\nhistory — would it . . . be your opinion that you would be unable to discharge and\nperform your duty any further in this case and continue deliberating?‖ Juror No. 9\nreplied, ―Yes, sir.‖\n     Defendant Nunez‘s counsel asked Juror No. 9, ―What happened on Friday?‖\nShe replied, ―Friday is when I began to feel the pains that I have felt in the past.‖\nNunez‘s counsel asked Juror No. 9 if she had ―seen a doctor since Friday?‖ She\nsaid: ―I was trying to get in to see a doctor Friday afternoon and was unable to. So\nif I can today, I‘m going to try to get in to see a doctor.‖\n     After hearing argument, the court ruled: ―The court finds good cause to\nexcuse Juror No. 9. . . . [T]his court finds that this juror‘s unable to perform her\nduty; and given that she . . . two years ago lost a child at five months because of\nstress at work, and given the stress that this case has caused upon her throughout\nthis trial — she has suffered one hemorrhage, and now she is having pains again\nstarting Friday — to ask her to continue on to endanger her life and also the life of\nher unborn child, if that is the ultimate risk . . . would be a high price to pay for\njury duty. . . . [T]he court finds good cause that this juror is unable to perform the\njuror‘s duty because she‘s sick.‖ It then discharged Juror No. 9.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendants fault the trial court for discharging Juror No. 9 for cause. We\nperceive no error.\n\n\n\n                                           74\n\f     As noted above in part II.C.1.b., section 1089 ―authorizes the trial court to\ndischarge a juror at any time before or after the final submission of the case to the\njury if, upon good cause, the juror is ‗found to be unable to perform his or her\nduty.‘ ‖ (Bennett, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 621.) ―Removal of a juror under section\n1089 is committed to the discretion of the trial court, and we review such\ndecisions by asking whether the grounds for such removal appear in the record as\na demonstrable reality.‖ (Thompson, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 137.) Defendants\ncontend the record here shows no such demonstrable reality because Juror No. 9\ndid not persist in her efforts to see a doctor about her condition, and because the\ntrial court did not speak to Juror No. 9‘s doctor about the pain she was feeling.\nThey note that previously, when Juror No. 9 was forced to temporarily suspend\nher jury service because of severe pain, her doctor had attributed the pain to a cyst,\nnot stress, and had told the court that Juror No. 9 could resume jury service after\nthree days of rest.\n     Juror No. 9 had a high-risk pregnancy and was experiencing pain, and earlier\nin the penalty phase she had experienced hemorrhaging that caused her doctor to\norder her to go on bed rest and suspend her jury service for three days. She felt\nstress from the jury deliberations, and a previous pregnancy had ended in a\nmiscarriage that occurred when she was under stress. Based on these\ncircumstances, the trial court had ample reason to discharge Juror No. 9. (See\nThompson, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 138 [trial-related stress can provide good cause\nfor discharging a juror]; People v. Collins (1976) 17 Cal.3d 687, 690-691, 696\n(Collins) [juror properly discharged because of inability to cope with the\nexperience of being a juror]; People v. Fudge (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1099-1100\n[juror properly discharged because of anxiety about new job].)\n\n\n\n\n                                         75\n\f           3. Failure to instruct jury to begin deliberations anew\n\n                a. Factual background\n     When the trial court first learned that Juror No. 9 was ill and might be unable\nto return to jury service, it told the parties it was considering instructing the jury\nwith CALJIC No. 17.51, which directs the jury, following the replacement of a\njuror with an alternate during deliberations, to ―set aside and disregard all past\ndeliberations and begin deliberating anew.‖ But when the court replaced Juror No.\n10 with Alternate Juror No. 2, it instead instructed the jury, without objection,\nsolely in the language of CALJIC No. 17.51.1: ―Members of the jury, a juror has\nbeen replaced by an alternate juror. The alternate juror was present during the\npresentation of all the evidence, arguments of counsel, and reading of instructions\nduring the guilt phase of the trial. However, the alternate juror did not participate\nin the jury deliberations which resulted in the verdicts and findings returned by\nyou to this point. For the purposes of this penalty phase of the trial, the alternate\njuror must accept as having been proved beyond a reasonable doubt those guilty\nverdicts and true findings rendered by the jury in the guilt phase of this trial. Your\nfunction now is to determine along with the other jurors, in the light of the prior\nverdict or verdicts and findings and the evidence and law, what penalty should be\nimposed. Each of you must participate fully in the deliberations, including any\nreview as may be necessary of the evidence presented in the guilt phase of the\ntrial.‖ The court did not give CALJIC No. 17.51.\n     When the trial court later replaced Juror No. 9 with Alternate Juror No. 4, it\nagain gave CALJIC No. 17.51.1, but not CALJIC No. 17.51. As before, there was\nno objection. The record contains no explanation for the court‘s failure to give\nCALJIC No. 17.51.\n     After Juror No. 9 was replaced, the jury deliberated for about 50 minutes\nbefore reaching a verdict of death as to both defendants.\n\n\n                                           76\n\f                b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend that after replacing Jurors Nos. 9 and 10, the trial court\nerred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard its previous penalty deliberations\nand to begin deliberating anew. (See CALJIC No. 17.51.) They rely on Collins,\nsupra, 17 Cal.3d 687.\n     In Collins, which was not a death penalty case, we held that ―substitution of\nan alternate for an original juror is constitutionally permissible after deliberations\nhave begun‖ when ―good cause has been shown and the jury has been instructed to\nbegin deliberations anew.‖ (Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 691.) We observed:\n―The requirement that 12 persons reach a unanimous verdict is not met unless\nthose 12 reach their consensus through deliberations which are the common\nexperience of all of them. It is not enough that 12 jurors reach a unanimous\nverdict if 1 juror has not had the benefit of the deliberations of the other 11.\nDeliberations provide the jury with the opportunity to review the evidence in light\nof the perception and memory of each member. Equally important in shaping a\nmember‘s viewpoint are the personal reactions and interactions as any individual\njuror attempts to persuade others to accept his or her viewpoint. The result is a\nbalance easily upset if a new juror enters the decision-making process after the 11\nothers have commenced deliberations. The elements of number and unanimity\ncombine to form an essential element of unity in the verdict. By this we mean that\na defendant may not be convicted except by 12 jurors who have heard all the\nevidence and argument and who together have deliberated to unanimity.‖ (Id. at\np. 693.) We therefore construed section 1089, which authorizes trial courts to\nreplace a sitting juror with an alternate, as requiring any court making such a\nreplacement to ―instruct the jury to set aside and disregard all past deliberations\nand begin deliberating anew.‖ (Collins, at p. 694.) But we held that the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                          77\n\fcourt‘s erroneous failure to give such an instruction in Collins was harmless under\nstate law. (Id. at p. 697.)\n     In People v. Fields (1983) 35 Cal.3d 329 (Fields), a capital case, the\ndefendant argued that the trial court violated his right to a jury that was a\nrepresentative cross-section of the community at the guilt phase of trial by\nexcusing for cause prospective jurors whose views about the death penalty made\nthem unable to sit as jurors at the penalty phase. In explaining why his claim\nlacked merit, we discussed why such jurors could not routinely be allowed to serve\non the jury during the guilt phase, and replaced with alternates for the penalty\nphase. (Id. at p. 351, fn. 9.) We observed: ―[A]n alternate joining the jury after it\nhad deliberated on the issues of guilt and special circumstances and reached a\nverdict . . . would be joining a group which has already discussed and evaluated\nthe circumstances of the crime, the capacity of the defendant, and other issues\nwhich bear both on guilt and on penalty. The resulting deliberations between old\nmembers who have already considered the evidence and may have arrived at\ntentative conclusions on some aspects of the case, and new members ignorant of\nthose discussions and conclusions, would depart from the requirement that jurors\n‗reach their consensus through deliberations which are the common experience of\nall of them‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 351, quoting Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 693.)\n     Despite this language in Fields, supra, 35 Cal.3d at page 351, we have\nrepeatedly held that a trial court need not give an instruction based on Collins,\nsupra, 17 Cal.3d 687, when an alternate juror is substituted at the penalty phase\nbefore deliberations begin. (See, e.g., People v. Ashmus (1991) 54 Cal.3d 932,\n1005.) But here, the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations had already begun when\nJuror Nos. 9 and 10 were discharged; hence the instruction was required. (See\nLedesma, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 743 [discharge of juror after penalty deliberations\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\fhad begun did not require discharge of the entire jury because the court instructed\nthe jury to disregard their past deliberations and begin deliberations anew].)\n     We therefore consider whether the trial court‘s error in not instructing the\njury to set aside its previous deliberations and begin anew was prejudicial. Both\ndefendants contend this error violated their rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. In Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d\nat page 697, footnote 5, we held that such an error does not violate the federal\nConstitution when it occurs at the guilt phase; here defendants offer no persuasive\nargument why the result should be different when the error occurs at the penalty\nphase. Therefore, our prejudice assessment applies the test for state law error at\nthe penalty phase of trial: Is there a ―reasonable possibility‖ that the error affected\nthe jury‘s penalty verdict? (People v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 719.)\n     In assessing prejudice, we note that each time the trial court replaced a sitting\njuror with an alternate, it explained: ―Your function now is to determine along\nwith the other jurors, . . . what penalty should be imposed. Each of you must\nparticipate fully in the deliberations, including any review as may be necessary of\nthe evidence presented in the guilt phase of the trial.‖ Although this instruction\ndid not expressly state that deliberations were to begin anew, its comment that\neach juror must ―participate fully in the deliberations‖ implied that this was the\ncase. (See People v. Cain (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 66 [such language did not ―suggest\nthe substituted juror should play less than an equal role‖ in reviewing the guilt\nphase evidence to assess the circumstances of the crime and the existence of\nlingering doubt].)\n     Furthermore, the Collins instruction plays a more limited role at the penalty\nphase of trial than at the guilt phase. ―Unlike the guilt determination, ‗the\nsentencing function is inherently moral and normative, not factual.‘ ‖ (People\nv. Hawthorne (1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 79.) Thus, a penalty phase juror properly\n\n                                          79\n\fconsiders ―personal religious, philosophical, or secular normative values‖ in\nmaking a penalty determination. (Danks, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 311; People v.\nLewis (2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 389-390 [jurors may rely ― ‗on their personal faith\nand deeply-held beliefs when facing the awesome decision of whether to impose\nthe sentence of death on a fellow citizen‘ ‖].) The standard penalty phase\ninstructions emphasize the personal nature of the penalty decision. Jurors are\ninstructed, as they were in this case, that each juror is ―free to assign [whatever]\nmoral or sympathetic value‖ that juror deems ―appropriate to each and all of the\nvarious factors‖ in aggravation and mitigation. (See CALJIC No. 8.88.) The\njurors in this case were also instructed that they could ―decide not to impose the\npenalty of death by granting the defendant mercy, regardless of whether or not [the\ndefendant] deserves . . . sympathy.‖\n     Although a juror‘s view regarding the weight of a particular aggravating or\nmitigating factor, or the extension of mercy, may be informed by discussion with\nother jurors, ultimately it is a profoundly personal decision qualitatively different\nfrom the fact finding required by the jury in determining guilt for the charged\noffenses, which was the situation we confronted in Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d 687.\nMoreover, unlike at the guilt phase, although a juror may be required to find some\nfacts at the penalty phase, a juror can consider an aggravating factor even if other\njurors do not agree it has been proven.\n     For these reasons — the language of the instruction given, and the normative\ncontext of the penalty phase deliberations — we conclude there was no reasonable\npossibility that the outcome of the penalty phase was affected by the trial court‘s\nfailure to instruct the jury to set aside its prior deliberations when it replaced\nJurors Nos. 9 and 10 with alternate jurors.\n\n\n\n\n                                           80\n\f           4. Constitutionality of the death penalty statute\n     Both defendants contend that the California death penalty law is\nunconstitutional, asserting various claims we have repeatedly rejected in the past.\n     Thus, we have said that ―the California death penalty statute is not\nimpermissibly broad, whether considered on its face or as interpreted by this\ncourt.‖ (People v. Dykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 813 (Dykes).) We have further\n―reject[ed] the claim that section 190.3, factor (a), on its face or as interpreted and\napplied, permits arbitrary and capricious imposition of a sentence of death.‖\n(Ibid.; see Tuilaepa v. California (1994) 512 U.S. 967, 975-976, 978.)\n     Contrary to defendants‘ assertion, the death penalty statute contains adequate\nsafeguards to avoid arbitrary and capricious sentencing and does not deprive\ndefendants of the right to a jury trial, even though it does not require ―unanimity as\nto the truth of aggravating circumstances, or findings beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat an aggravating circumstance (other than section 190.3, factor (b) or (c)\nevidence) has been proved, that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating\nfactors, or that death is the appropriate sentence.‖ (People v. Lynch (2010) 50\nCal.4th 693, 766.) Nothing in Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270,\nBlakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296, Ring v. Arizona (2002) 536 U.S. 584,\nor Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, affects our conclusions in this\nregard. (People v. Dement (2011) 53 Cal.4th 1, 55.)\n     The federal Constitution does not require the jury to make ― ‗written findings\nof the factors it finds in aggravation and mitigation.‘ ‖ (Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th\nat p. 813.) At the penalty phase, the jury may properly consider a defendant‘s\nunadjudicated criminal activity. (People v. Martinez (2010) 47 Cal.4th 911, 968.)\nUse of the adjectives ―extreme‖ and ―substantial‖ in section 190.3, factors (d) and\n(g) is constitutional. (People v. Valencia (2008) 43 Cal.4th 268, 311.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\f     ― ‗ ―[T]he statutory instruction to the jury to consider ‗whether or not‘ certain\nmitigating factors were present did not impermissibly invite the jury to aggravate\nthe sentence upon the basis of nonexistent or irrational aggravating factors.\n[Citations.]‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Parson (2008) 44 Cal.4th 332, 369.) Moreover, here\nthe trial court instructed the jury: ―The permissible aggravating factors are limited\nto those aggravating factors upon which you have been specifically instructed.\nTherefore, the evidence which has been presented by the defense regarding the\ndefendant‘s background may only be considered by you as mitigating evidence.‖\n     Intercase proportionality review is not constitutionally required. (People v.\nStevens (2007) 41 Cal.4th 182, 212 (Stevens); see Pulley v. Harris (1984) 465 U.S.\n37, 50-51.) Moreover, ―capital and noncapital defendants are not similarly\nsituated and therefore may be treated differently without violating constitutional\nguarantees of equal protection of the laws or due process of law.‖ (People v.\nManriquez (2005) 37 Cal.4th 547, 590.)\n     Both defendants contend that their death sentences violate international law.\nHere, there were no violations of state or federal law that preclude imposition of\nthe death penalty in this case, and defendants ―point[] to no authority that\n‗prohibit[s] a sentence of death rendered in accordance with state and federal\nconstitutional and statutory requirements.‘ ‖ (Stevens, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 213.)\n\n           5. Asserted cumulative error\n     Defendants contend that even if the errors at trial are not individually\nprejudicial, they were so prejudicial cumulatively that they require reversal of\ndefendants‘ murder convictions and the judgments of death. We have concluded\nthat the trial court committed instructional error pertaining to the street gang and\nfirearm use enhancement allegations that requires vacation of those findings, and\nwe have found that the duplicative multiple-murder special-circumstance findings\n\n\n\n                                          82\n\fmust be vacated. We have also concluded that the court erred by failing to instruct\nthe jury on the intent to kill requirement for the multiple-murder special-\ncircumstance allegations when a defendant is an aider and abettor, by failing to\nadminister the oath required by Code of Civil Procedure section 232‘s subdivision\n(b) to three jurors who were originally selected as alternates and later replaced\nsitting jurors, and by failing to instruct the jury in the language of CALJIC No.\n17.51 upon replacing two jurors during the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations.\nThese errors do not, whether considered individually or cumulatively, require\nreversal of either the murder convictions or the judgments of death.\n                                  III. DISPOSITION\n     As to both defendants, we vacate the true findings on the allegations\npertaining to the street gang and firearm use enhancements, we vacate one\nmultiple-murder special-circumstance finding for each defendant, and we\notherwise affirm the judgments.\n\n\n                                                 KENNARD, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

(Pen. Code,1\n§§ 187, subd. (a), 189.) The jury also found true special circumstance allegations\nof multiple murder (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3)), and sentence enhancement allegations\nthat defendants committed the murders to benefit a criminal street gang and used\nfirearms to commit them. (§§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 12022.53, subd. (d).) Special\ncircumstance allegations that defendants intentionally killed the victims because of\ntheir race (§ 190.2, subd.

At the penalty phase,\nthe jury returned death verdicts, and the trial court entered judgments of death.\nThis appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11(a); § 1239, subd. (b).)

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution evidence\n     On October 29, 1998, at about 11:00 p.m., a Black couple, Edward Robinson\nand his girlfriend Renesha Ann Fuller, were shot and killed outside Robinson‘s\ntownhouse at 254th Street and Frampton Avenue in Harbor City. Robinson‘s\nsister heard the shots, looked out her second-story window, and saw a big, older\nmodel car with horizontal tail lights driving away. Four shell casings were found\nat the scene. An autopsy revealed that Robinson was shot three or four times.\nFuller was shot twice, but one of the bullets may have first traveled through\nRobinson.\n     Ernie Vasquez, who was in the area that night, testified that even though few\ncars were on the road the night of October 29, 1998, on several occasions during a\nperiod of 15 to 20 minutes he saw an older Buick Regal or similar model sedan,\nburgundy or dull red in color, driving near the area of the murders. The car, which\ncontained three or four people Vasquez did not know, had horizontal tail lights.\nVasquez later identified Juan Carlos Caballero as the driver. (Caballero was\nmurdered shortly after the murders in this case.) Persons resembling defendant\nSatele (also known as ―Wilbone‖) and defendant Nunez (also known as ―Speedy‖)\nwere, respectively, in the front passenger seat and backseat of the vehicle. After\nabout 11:00 p.m., while Vasquez was parked in a hotel driveway, he heard shots,\nducked down, and then drove away. After driving for about a minute, he saw a\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fbody lying in the road, and stopped to assist the victim, who he later learned was\nRobinson.\n     Around midnight that same night, about an hour after Robinson and Fuller\nwere murdered, Joshua Contreras met both defendants and Caballero at a\nneighborhood park. Defendants and Contreras were members of the West Side\nWilmas gang. Contreras heard defendant Satele say, ―We were out looking for\nniggers,‖ and heard Satele or Nunez say, ―I think we hit one of ‘em.‖\n     The next evening, Contreras was at a friend‘s house with several people,\nincluding both defendants. Satele appeared nervous, and told Contreras that the\nmurders of the ―Black guy and Black girl‖ that he had shot were ―in the news.‖\nSatele told Contreras ―he was driving right there in Harbor City and he saw a\nBlack guy or Black girl hugging or kissing or something and he just shot them.‖\n     Later that night around 3:40 a.m., Los Angeles Police Officers Adam\nGreenburg and Vinh Nguyen were in a marked police when they saw a car, later\nidentified as a four-door Chrysler, driving with its headlights off. The Chrysler\npulled over to the curb. As the officers pulled in front of the Chrysler and\nactivated their car‘s emergency lights, three occupants fled the Chrysler. (At trial,\nOfficer Greenburg identified defendant Nunez as the person who had been driving\nand defendant Satele as the person who had been seated in the front passenger\nseat.) The police pursued Satele and arrested him. On the Chrysler‘s driver‘s seat\nwas a white baseball cap with the word ―west‖ on the front and the name\n―Speedy‖ on the back. Between the driver‘s and passenger seats was a large\nsemiautomatic Norinco Mak-90, an AK-47-type assault rifle. The rifle was\nidentified as the murder weapon through ballistics testing. A magazine attached to\nthe weapon contained 26 live rounds of jacketed hollow-point cartridges; the\nmagazine was capable of carrying 30 rounds.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f     Joshua Contreras, who had joined the West Side Wilmas gang shortly before\nthe two murders, told police that both defendants were ―riders‖ — persons who\n―kill[ed] their enemies‖ — and that they had an AK-47 rifle they called\n―Monster.‖ Contreras saw defendant Satele put the AK-47 into the ―car that\nSpeedy [defendant Nunez] had‖ shortly before defendant Satele was arrested. (At\ntrial, Contreras denied or claimed not to remember his statements to police, and\nthose statements were introduced as prior inconsistent statements.)\n     On December 3, 1998, several weeks after the two murders, Ernie Vasquez\nand defendant Satele were in a cell in a Los Angeles County jail. When Satele\nheard that Vasquez was from Harbor City, he asked if Vasquez had heard about\nthe killings there. When Vasquez said, ―I think so, yes‖ or ―something . . . to that\nnature,‖ Satele said, ―Well, we did that,‖ or possibly ―I did that,‖ adding, ―I AK‘d\nthem,‖ or ―We AK‘d them.‖ Vasquez mentioned these statements to police\nofficers on January 6, 1999, after his fingerprint had been found on victim Fuller‘s\ncar. At Vasquez‘s request, he was then transferred to the Lynwood jail, which was\ncloser to his home.\n     On January 7, 1999, defendant Nunez, who was a trusty at Lynwood jail,\napproached Vasquez. Nunez asked if Vasquez was from Harbor City, and\nVasquez said, ―Yes.‖ Nunez said he had killed ―those niggers . . . in your\nneighborhood.‖ Nunez mentioned that he had been driving down the street when\none of the victims ―looked at him wrong,‖ so Nunez ―turned back around and\nblasted‖ the victim.\n     On February 9, 1999, Los Angeles Police Detective Robert Dinlocker\nshowed both defendants a photograph of the four-door Chrysler in which they\nwere seen on the night after the murders, and asked them if that car was used in\nthe homicide. Two days later, defendants were falsely told they were going to be\nbooked on murder charges; while being transported together to and from the\n\n                                          4\n\fcourthouse their conversations were recorded. Defendant Satele said: ―I not even\nreally sweating it dog, because all that shit that they got, that shit‘s wrong. . . . But\nif them mother fuckers would have shown me the car that we fuckin‘ actually did\nthat shit in, fuck, I‘d be stressing like a mother fucker.‖\n     At defendants‘ murder trial, Ruby Feliciano testified that she owned the four-\ndoor Chrysler in which defendants were seen on the night after the murders. A\nweek earlier, she had taken the car to defendant Nunez for repairs, and he had\npromised to return the car that evening. He did not do so, and a week later she\nsaw a woman driving her car. When she later told Nunez she was going to report\nher car as stolen, he threatened her life. After the car was impounded by police\nshortly after the two murders, Feliciano received a telephone call from Nunez‘s\ngirlfriend; Nunez, who was in jail, was also on the line. During this three-way\nconversation, Nunez asked Feliciano to change what she had told the detectives,\nand his girlfriend asked Feliciano to say that she had spoken to Nunez and his\ngirlfriend at a certain time on the night police recovered the car, and that Nunez\nhad been home at the time.\n     The prosecution presented evidence of defendant Nunez‘s animus against\nBlacks. Esther Collins, who is Black, testified that in September 1997, defendant\nNunez, who was intoxicated, came up to her in her garage, and calling her a\n―nigger,‖ asked for money or drugs. When Collins said she had none, Nunez\nagain called her a ―nigger‖ and spat on her. He then hit Collins in the mouth with\na hard object, fracturing her jaw, and said, ―[n]igger, get up nigger.‖ Collins‘s\nhusband, who is also Black, came out to the garage with a ―pop gun‖ in an effort\nto scare Nunez off. Nunez laughed at him, threw ―the word ‗nigger‘ around,‖ and\nleft. Collins, who was afraid of the West Side Wilmas gang (of which Nunez was\na member), did not report the incident to the police that day because she did not\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fwant trouble. When Collins later reported the assault, she did not mention that\nNunez was drunk.\n     At the time Collins testified against defendants, she was incarcerated. She\ntestified that on one occasion when she and defendant Nunez were on the bus from\njail to court, he said, ―Are you testifying? Don‘t testify. Something like that.‖\nNunez also asked, ―Where is your son? Is he in custody?‖ Collins denied she was\npersonally afraid to testify, but said she feared reprisal against her son, who was\nalso in prison, because ―[i]t‘s a black and racial thing in jail.‖ Los Angeles\nDistrict Attorney‘s Office Investigator John Neff testified he had spoken to Collins\nthe week before her testimony. Collins told him she was afraid to testify because,\nwhile on the transportation bus, ―one of the defendants had made a veiled threat by\nasking how her son was,‖ and then saying, ― ‗You‘re not going to testify, are\nyou?‘ ‖\n     The prosecution presented evidence that West Side Wilmas gang members\nother than defendants had committed crimes. Detective Dinlocker testified that\nRuben Figueroa and Brian Dominic Martinez were West Side Wilmas gang\nmembers, and the prosecution introduced records of Martinez‘s conviction for\nassault with a firearm and Figueroa‘s convictions for murder and assault with a\ndeadly weapon.\n     Los Angeles Police Officer Julie Rodriguez testified as an expert on the West\nSide Wilmas gang. She said the gang‘s primary activities are ―anything that‘s\ngoing to benefit the gang,‖ including narcotic sales and murder. ―Associates‖ of\nthe gang are younger boys who are ―trying to prove themselves,‖ and ―hang out\nwith the gang members,‖ but who ―aren‘t quite yet‖ gang members. The area of\nthe two murders was not claimed by the West Side Wilmas but by rival gangs.\nAccording to Rodriguez, murdering a Black couple with no gang ties would cause\ndefendants to ―move . . . up in the gang.‖ In her view, if defendants here murdered\n\n                                          6\n\fRobinson and Fuller (a Black couple with no gang ties), they did so with the\nspecific intent to promote, further or assist in the criminal activity of West Side\nWilmas.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Scott Chapman, who was assigned to the\ngang unit at the Men‘s Central Jail, testified that while rival gang members in the\nstreet will attack each other, ―[o]nce they come into county jail it becomes a race\nissue . . . [and] [t]hey bond together to protect themselves.‖ Hispanic gangs\nsometimes include persons who, like defendant Satele, are of Samoan descent.\n\n           2. Defense evidence\n\n               a. Defendant Nunez\n     Yolanda Guaca, defendant Nunez‘s girlfriend and the mother of his two\nchildren, testified that Nunez was at home with her from about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m.\non October 29, 1998 (the night of the murders), until the next morning. Guaca‘s\nmother Sandra Lopez gave similar testimony. Lopez, who lived with defendant\nNunez and Guaca, said that the only way in and out of their home was through the\nfront door. Because the front screen door was damaged, once everyone was home\nshe ordinarily tied a string to it in such a manner that the door could not be entered\nfrom the outside unless a person inside the house opened it. When she awoke on\nthe morning of October 30, the string had not been disturbed.\n     Defendant Nunez testified that he was born in National City and was 24\nyears old. Between the ages of 10 and 12 he stole bicycles for the West Side\nWilmas. When he was ―[m]aybe 12‖ years old he became a member of the gang\nand began selling rock cocaine and sometimes marijuana. Between the ages of 14\nand 20 he was incarcerated for auto theft and selling cocaine. While incarcerated\nhe and three other inmates assaulted two other Latino gang members.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f     After his release at age 20, defendant Nunez moved into the Norwalk home\nhis mother shared with her husband, defendant‘s younger sister, and his younger\nbrother. He worked in a warehouse for several months, but he had difficulty\ngetting a ride to work and did not know how to take the bus. He was accepted at\nCerritos College, but left the area before the semester began.\n     Defendant Nunez left his mother‘s home after two months because he did not\nwant to interfere with his mother‘s life. His father, who lived in San Diego, had\nnot helped in raising him, and he did not want to ask his father for anything. He\nreturned to Wilmington and to the West Side Wilmas gang because he ―didn‘t\nknow anything else‖ to do and did not want to ask for help. He lost his\nidentification documentation, which impeded the few efforts he made to find a job.\nHe started selling crack cocaine and methamphetamine. Between the time of his\nrelease at age 20 and his arrest in November 1998 shortly after the two murders\nhere, Nunez had three additional convictions, apparently for gun possession and\ndrug sales or possession. He said: ―Practically everything I did was against the\nlaw. I wasn‘t living right.‖\n     On the night of the two murders, Yolanda Guaca picked defendant Nunez up\nabout 9:00 p.m. They bought takeout food and went home, and defendant went to\nbed. He woke once during the night to speak with a visitor, went back to sleep,\nand then woke up again in the morning. On cross-examination, he conceded that\nhe sometimes left in the middle of the night without Yolanda‘s knowledge. He\ndenied meeting Joshua Contreras at a park a half-hour after the murders, and\ndenied that he had ever been a jail trusty.\n     Defendant Nunez said that Ruby Feliciano rented her car to him in exchange\nfor drugs. When he was arrested in November 1998 shortly after the two murders,\nhe thought he was being charged with stealing her car. He asked Yolanda to call\nFeliciano and ask her to tell the police ―the truth,‖ which was that he had not\n\n                                          8\n\fstolen her car. He ―sort of threatened‖ Feliciano, telling her that if she visited, she\nshould bring the money she owed him.\n     Defendant Nunez admitted assaulting Esther Collins. He said that he had\nbeen drunk and had hit Collins with a small, hard handball because she had not\npaid a debt. He had ―no excuse‖ for hitting her, but he denied that he hit her\nbecause she was Black.\n     On cross-examination, the prosecutor introduced defendant Nunez‘s\nstatements during a December 1998 interview with detectives. In the interview,\nNunez was asked if he had a history of ―hating Black people.‖ He replied, ―I don‘t\nhate them. I believe in segregation, but I mean, why would I go and shots [sic]\nany Black person, there is a lot of them in Wilmington.‖ He also said, ―I can‘t\nstand how they get loud. . . . I just believe in segregation. I don‘t like them [too]\nmuch by me, that‘s what I‘m saying. Why I would go all the way to Harbor City\nto just shoot a Black person?‖ The prosecutor played a segment of the February\n11, 1999, tape recording of both defendants‘ conversation in the jail van\ntransporting them to court (see pp. 4-5, ante), in which Nunez said he wanted ―no\nBlack people, woods straight woods.‖ After listening to this segment, Nunez\ntestified that the term ―woods‖ means ―White people.‖ He said he and defendant\nSatele did not discuss the murders in the van.\n     Jacqueline Oree testified that her 16-year-old twin sons, Jayson and Jonathan\nBrooks, who are Black, were friends with both defendants for about six years\nwhen Oree lived in Wilmington, and that defendant Nunez came over two or three\ntimes a week. Defendant Satele watched her house while she was on vacation,\nnever spoke derogatorily about Black persons or used the word ―nigger,‖ and\nnever harmed her sons physically or emotionally. Oree‘s two sons were involved\nwith the West Side Wilmas gang, an activity she did not approve of. Oree moved\nout of the West Side Wilmas‘s territory in August 1999.\n\n                                           9\n\f     Jayson Brooks, Oree‘s son, testified that he had known both defendants for\nabout three or four years, that all three of them were in the West Side Wilmas\ngang, and they spent their time doing recreational activities such as playing\nbasketball, swimming, and having barbecues.\n     Byron Wilson, who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death,\ntestified that he knew defendant Nunez in jail from September 1999 to April 2000.\nFor most of this period, defendant Nunez was a jail trusty. Wilson never heard\nhim use ―the N-word.‖\n     Vondrea Williams, who was in custody awaiting trial on charges of\naggravated mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon, testified that he had met\ndefendant Nunez in jail about eight or nine months earlier. Williams and Nunez\nwere jail trusties, and the two alternated shifts. Williams, a Black man, said that\nNunez showed no prejudice and treated Black inmates with respect.\n     Jesus Esparza, who was in jail while awaiting trial on an attempted murder\ncharge, testified that he had been in a cell next to Nunez‘s for several weeks. He\nnever heard Nunez refer to Blacks in disparaging terms, nor were there any\nincidents between Nunez and any Black inmate. On one occasion in December\n1999, when the cells were going to be searched, Esparza threw a four-foot-long\nhard object made from tightly wrapped paper out of his cell into the hall. The\nguards assumed the object belonged to defendant Nunez, even though Esparza\nclaimed it was his. Nunez stood silent, and was punished with 20 days in the\n―hole,‖ a place Esparza described as ―sort of‖ like solitary confinement.\n     David Butler, a firearms examiner, retired Los Angeles police officer, and\n―distinguished member‖ of the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners,\ntestified that the casings found at the murder scene bore marks consistent with\nhaving been fired from the gun found in the car in which defendants were riding\nthe night after the two murders. The magazine attached to this gun held 30\n\n                                         10\n\frounds. The bullets contained steel penetrators, and were originally designed to\npenetrate light armor on military vehicles. In Butler‘s view, the shooter was fairly\nstationary when the shooting occurred. He could not tell whether the shooter fired\nfrom inside a car, but if so, the car was stopped at the time of the gun‘s discharge.\n\n               b. Defendant Satele\n     Lawrence Kelly testified that he had been a member of the West Side\nWilmas for 12 to 13 years. The gang had between 30 to 40 active members. One\nway the gang made money was by selling narcotics; some gang members may also\nhave committed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, but the gang did not do\ndrive-by shootings. A gang member who testified against another gang member\nwould be ―beat up‖ or even killed.\n     At about midnight on the night of the murders (committed around\n11:00 p.m.), Kelly met defendant Satele at a park playground. Also present were\ndefendant Nunez, Joshua Contreras, and Juan Carlos Caballero. Kelly was at the\npark for ―a minute or two,‖ and then walked with defendant Satele to the nearby\nhome of Kelly‘s girlfriend. Contrary to what Contreras told the police, Kelly did\nnot hear defendant Satele say, ―We were out looking for niggers,‖ nor did he hear\neither defendant say, ―I think we got one.‖ At this time, Kelly owned a 1980\nbrown Buick Regal. (As previously mentioned, prosecution witness Ernie\nVasquez testified that on the night of the murders he saw an older Buick Regal or\nsimilar model sedan driving near the area of the murders, and that persons\nresembling Nunez and Satele were passengers in the car.)\n     Kelly identified exhibit No. 48, the murder weapon, as a gun to which\neveryone in the West Side Wilmas gang had access, adding that the gun was used\nto protect gang members engaged in drug transactions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f     Kelly had known defendant Satele for about two years and had never heard\ndefendant Satele ―use the ‗N‘ word‖ or display disrespect for Black persons.\n     Kelly knew Joshua Contreras (a prosecution witness), and saw him nearly\nevery day during 1998, the year of the two murders here. On most occasions,\nContreras was under the influence of crystal methamphetamine and ―[v]ery\nparanoid.‖ Kelly explained: ―He would think people were after him or what not\nor saying things. His mind was just playing tricks on him and stuff.‖\n     Richard Satele, defendant Satele‘s father, testified that his son had never\nexhibited racial bias and had been taught to ―respect all races and all people.‖\n     Darnell Demery, the husband of defendant Satele‘s cousin, testified that he\nhad never heard Satele say anything derogatory about Blacks or ―use the ‗N‘\nword,‖ nor had he seen Satele being verbally or physically aggressive. Satele did\nnot have a bad temper and got ―along with everybody.‖ Demery was not aware\nthat Satele was involved with the West Side Wilmas gang.\n     Willy Guillory, a teacher at defendant Satele‘s high school and a longtime\nfamily friend, testified that Satele caused no problems at school, had never\nreferred to Black persons as ―niggers,‖ and had never behaved ―against any racial\ncomponent in our society.‖\n     The parties stipulated that, if called to testify, Los Angeles Police Officer\nSimmons would testify that she had interviewed murder victim Edward\nRobinson‘s sister on October 29, 1998, at the scene of the shooting, and that her\nreport stated that the sister had said: ―We were all inside my apartment playing\ncards, it was time for [murder victim Fuller] to go home. My brother walked her\noutside to her car. I went outside on my patio that overlooked the street, to ask my\nbrother if he locked the front door. . . . Before I had a chance to ask him anything,\nI heard about seven shots or more. Then I saw a small gray-colored car driving\ndown the street.‖\n\n                                         12\n\f     Dr. Lewis Yablonski, a gang expert, testified that to familiarize himself with\nthe West Side Wilmas gang, he had interviewed four members – defendant Satele,\nLawrence Kelly, and Jayson and Jonathan Brooks. Dr. Yablonski was of the view\nthat defendant Satele had no ―special hostility towards Black people.‖\n     According to Dr. Yablonski: ―[W]hen a gang member is in jail, there is an\nissue of survival. Consequently, he may . . . brag a lot to indicate he‘s bad.‖\nPeople in custody, Dr. Yablonski said, brag about crimes they did not commit to\ngain a reputation. If defendant Satele, while in jail, told a rival gang member of\nHispanic descent, ―We did a shooting,‖ this would mean he was trying to impress\nthe other person with the fact that his gang was tough and violent, and to warn the\nother person to leave him alone. The word ―we‖ in this context would not\nnecessarily mean the person making the statement was involved in the crime, but\nrather would refer to the gang‘s activity, much as one might say of one‘s\nbasketball team, ―We beat Indianapolis.‖ If an inmate was bragging about\nsomething he personally did, he would be more likely to say ―I‖ than ―we,‖ but if\none inmate said ―we‖ committed a double murder, and another inmate said ―I‖\ncommitted the same murder, the pronoun used would not necessarily be significant\nin ascertaining who committed the crime.\n\n           3. Rebuttal evidence\n     Glenn Phillips testified that in November 1999, defense witness Lawrence\nKelly visited Phillips‘s home in Redondo Beach, where Kelly spoke to Warren\nBattle, who was Black and worked for Phillips. Kelly asked if Battle would like to\n―make a hundred bucks to do a job for him.‖ Battle replied, ―Yes, of course‖ and\nKelly then said he needed Battle ―to testify we get along with Black people.‖\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Larry Arias testified that on November\n9, 1999, he was escorting a Black inmate named Keys in the Men‘s Central Jail.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fKeys, who was ―waist chained‖ and could not raise his hands to his face, was\npunched in the face by defendant Satele and fell to the ground. Keys had not\nprovoked the attack.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff John Kepley testified that on December\n2, 1999, he conducted a random search of a module in the Men‘s Central Jail.\nEach cell housed one inmate. While standing in front of cell 14, he saw an inmate\nin cell 16 walk up to the gate, look down the row, and throw the ―shaft‖ of a\n―spear‖ into the area in front of the cell. Jail records showed that defendant Nunez\nwas assigned to cell 16. Kepley did not recall any inmate claiming responsibility\nfor throwing out the object.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase\n\n           1. Prosecution evidence\n     The prosecution presented victim impact testimony and evidence of\ndefendant Nunez‘s jail misconduct.\n     Testifying about 21-year-old murder victim Renesha Ann Fuller were\nRoberta Hollis (Renesha‘s mother) and Simon Hollis (Renesha‘s stepfather).\n(Because each victim has the same surname as several of the penalty phase\nwitnesses, we refer to the victims and witnesses by their first names in this portion\nof the opinion.) Roberta provided transportation to persons with AIDS, and Simon\nwas an Inglewood police officer. Roberta described Renesha as quiet, sweet, and\ninnocent: a ―mother‘s . . . dream in a child.‖ After Renesha‘s murder, Roberta\nmissed six months of work.\n     Roberta and Simon testified that Renesha did well in school, and had just\nstarted her first year of college when she was killed. She worked as a teacher‘s\naide at a school for students who had ―dropped out of school and had hard times.‖\nAfter the murder, Renesha‘s students started a college scholarship in her name.\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f     Testifying about 22-year-old murder victim Edward Robinson were Leandrea\nFields-Robinson (Edward‘s stepmother), Albert Robinson (Edward‘s father), Rosa\nRobinson Morris (Edward‘s sister), and Renesha Robinson (Edward‘s niece).\nLeandrea, a former teacher and counselor, was an administrator for the Los\nAngeles Unified School District. Albert was in the construction industry, and\nspecialized in installing tennis courts. After Edward‘s mother died in childbirth,\nLeandrea raised Edward from the time he was three months old.\n     Murder victim Edward was close to his father, and Leandrea said the two\nwould talk for hours ―about being a man and doing the right thing.‖ Edward\nattended Harbor City College, and worked part-time for his father to help pay for\nschool. Edward led a prayer group at church, was the church drummer, and was\nthe kind of person ―that any mother or father would love to have to call their son.‖\nHis father recalled that ―a lot of young people his age . . . said because of him they\nturned their lives around and started going to church and studying the Bible.‖\nEdward was taught to respect women, and it was reflective of his character that he\nwas walking Renesha to her car on the night they were murdered.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Randall Shickler testified that on August\n17, 1999, he and another deputy transported defendant Nunez from court back to\njail. Nunez was in the front section of the bus with about 12 other inmates, and\none of his hands was handcuffed to a chain. Shickler heard a ratcheting sound and\nsaw that Nunez, no longer handcuffed, was standing over another inmate. He\nrefused orders to recuff, laughed, and began doing jumping jacks to demonstrate to\nShickler that he was free. After the bus reached the jail, when other deputies who\nhad been called out to assist were visible from inside the bus, Nunez put his\nhandcuffs back on. The officers determined that the handcuffs of about 10\ninmates on the bus had been altered.\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Lisa Estes testified that on one occasion\nin the middle of trial she searched defendant Nunez after he arrived from jail and\nbefore he appeared in court. She found a razor blade in a Bible Nunez was\ncarrying.\n     Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Ronald Baltierra testified that on May 8,\n2000, he saw another deputy search defendant Nunez before a court appearance.\nIn Nunez‘s mouth, the deputy found a heavy-duty staple, which in Baltierra‘s\nopinion could be used to unlock handcuffs.\n\n            2. Defense evidence\n\n               a. Defendant Nunez\n     Jorge Flores, defendant Nunez‘s father, testified that he and Betty Nunez,\ndefendant Nunez‘s mother, lived together while she was pregnant with defendant\nNunez. After he was born they continued to see each other for a couple of years.\nJorge had seen defendant Nunez about ―seven times.‖ He did not counsel and\nguide him as he was growing up. The last time he had seen defendant Nunez was\nin 1980 or 1981, when Jorge borrowed a car from the family and never returned it.\nAfter about 1984, when he married, he was under the impression that Betty did not\nwant her family to give him any information about defendant Nunez‘s location,\nand wanted Jorge to stay away from him. He regretted not being there for\ndefendant Nunez and guiding him.\n     Antonio Nunez, defendant Nunez‘s uncle, testified that Betty Nunez was his\nhalf sister. Their mother had a drinking problem. Antonio was 13 or 14 years old\nand Betty was about 18 years old when defendant Nunez was born. At the time,\nBetty was homeless and stayed with various relatives and friends, including\nAntonio‘s family; she was inexperienced at caring for an infant. Her resources\nwere extremely limited, and often when Betty was at Antonio‘s home there was no\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\ffood or clean diapers for defendant Nunez. Betty was an emotionally distant\nmother.\n     About a year after defendant Nunez was born, Antonio left school to support\nthe family. He eventually bought a house in Wilmington, and Nunez (who was\neight or nine years old) and Betty lived with him. Antonio worked long hours, and\nBetty worked at night, so Nunez was left unsupervised. Nunez was excited when\nhe did well in Little League, and Antonio regretted not going to more of his games\nor understanding its importance to him. Nunez was jealous of Antonio‘s wife\nwhen Antonio got married. When Nunez was between 12 and 14 years old, the\npolice raided Antonio‘s house looking for gang members. As a result, Antonio\nbecame concerned for his family‘s safety and asked Betty and Nunez to move out.\n     Yolanda Guaca, defendant Nunez‘s girlfriend and the mother of his two\nyoung sons, said she loved him and did not want to see him executed.\n     Dr. Saul Niedorf, a psychiatrist and pediatrician, testified that he had\ninterviewed defendant Nunez, and had also spoken with his mother, his uncle\nAntonio, two of his aunts, and Yolanda Guaca. He had reviewed Antonio Nunez‘s\ntrial testimony and at least some of defendant Nunez‘s records from the former\nCalifornia Youth Authority. He did not administer any tests, but he considered it\nlikely that defendant Nunez could read at a high school level.\n     Dr. Niedorf noted defendant Nunez‘s lack of bonding with his mother, and\nsaid defendant‘s uncle Antonio was his first consistent bond. As a result of\nAntonio‘s influence, Nunez was later a tender and caring father. When Nunez was\nabout 10 or 11, he lost this consistent attachment because Antonio became\ninvested in married life. Nunez looked for teenage boys to be attached to, and\nfound this attachment in gang members. In Dr. Niedorf‘s view, defendant was\ncompulsive and obsessive, and methodically and loyally worked at his ―job‖ of\nselling drugs. He participated in a work program while incarcerated as a teenager,\n\n                                         17\n\fand Dr. Niedorf noted that there are work programs in the California prison\nsystem.\n       In Dr. Niedorf‘s opinion, defendant Nunez was ―relatively free of explosive\nirrational behavior[],‖ and thought before he did things unless he was provoked.\nDr. Niedorf viewed his acts of misconduct in jail as acts of defiance that\ndeveloped his self-esteem. They were not based on a desire to escape, although\nthat desire was there, nor were they explosive or aggressive. He agreed, however,\nwith the prosecutor that such misconduct ―can create an explosive situation,‖ and\nthat ―going to a rival gang territory with a loaded assault rifle . . . with armor-\npiercing bullets and driving around in that area and looking to kill someone‖ was\naggressive. In Dr. Niedorf‘s view, defendant Nunez ―believe[d] he did not kill‖\nand ―grieve[d] that there were victims in this crime, who, as he would put it, were\ninnocent.‖\n\n                b. Defendant Satele\n       Testifying on defendant Satele‘s behalf were his parents, Richard and Esther\nSatele. Richard was 26 years old and Esther was 20 years old when Satele was\nborn, which occurred four or five months after Richard and Esther were married.\nRichard worked long hours at two jobs during their first two years of marriage,\nand started to drink. They had physical fights in Satele‘s presence. When Satele\nwas two or three years old, Esther left. Richard quit his night job and moved in\nwith his parents in Carson, who helped to raise Satele until he was about 12 years\nold.\n       When Richard was not at work, he tried to spend as much time with\ndefendant Satele as he could. Satele was active in sports, and Richard attended\nevery sports practice and took time off from work to attend the games. Every year\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\ffrom the time Satele was five years old they vacationed in places like Samoa,\nHawaii, or Palm Springs.\n     Esther visited her son once or twice a year when he was between the ages of\ntwo and a half and five, and about once a month after that. When defendant Satele\nwas about seven or eight years old, he visited Esther on weekends. Every time she\nbrought Satele back to Richard‘s house he was in tears and wanted to stay with\nher. Esther did not have her own home, but lived with her sister, and she did not\nthink that environment would be best for her son. When Satele was 11 or 12 years\nold, Esther returned to live with him and his father. She was never involved with\nSatele‘s education, and she did not meet his teachers or attend school functions.\n     When defendant Satele was about 12 years old, Richard bought a house in\nRedondo Beach. Satele was unhappy that he had to change schools. He was\ncaught ―tagging‖ (spray painting graffiti) at the school and was suspended.\nRichard typically disciplined Satele by slapping or using a belt, and on this\noccasion he ―gave him a good beating‖ with a belt. Satele was caught tagging\nagain a couple of months later, and told the school he did not want to go home\nbecause his father would beat him. The school contacted child protective services,\nwhich told Richard that corporal punishment was against the law and he could be\nprosecuted if another incident occurred. Richard turned to other forms of\ndiscipline, such as denying privileges, but ―troubles just kept on increasing.‖\n     Defendant Satele ran away on one occasion for a weekend, and on another\noccasion for a week, and Richard did not know where he was during those times.\nRichard asked Satele what they could do to stop this activity, and Satele said he\nwanted to return to Carson and live with his grandparents. Richard allowed him to\ndo so, and every day he drove his son to school in Carson. Satele ran away from\nhis grandparents‘ house as well, and began cutting classes. He received A‘s and\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fB‘s in classes he liked, such as math, and D‘s and F‘s in classes he disliked, such\nas English.\n     When defendant Satele was about 15, he was caught tagging again. Because\nof his previous offenses, he was incarcerated for three months in juvenile camp.\nRichard and Esther visited him every weekend. After leaving camp, he seemed to\ncommunicate more openly with his parents, and was interested in graduating from\nhigh school and possibly playing football.\n     When defendant Satele was 16, the police found him carrying a gun. He was\nplaced in a military boot camp for about four months, and Richard said he\nreceived ―rav[e] reviews.‖ Satele acknowledged that he needed discipline and did\nwell in that environment. He was about 17 years old when he was released, and\nexpressed a desire to graduate from school and ―do good.‖ He took night classes\nin addition to his regular school schedule so he could catch up. Six months later,\nwhen he was still 17 years old, he left home and dropped out of continuation\nschool. Richard eventually found him in Wilmington. Although he knew how to\ncontact Satele if he needed to, he left his son alone to fend for himself.\n     Looking back on defendant Satele‘s life, Esther believed she had failed him\n―constantly‖ as a mother. Richard asked the families of Renesha and Edward to\nforgive his son and asked the jury to spare his life.\n     Dr. Samuel Miles, a psychiatrist, testified that he interviewed defendant\nSatele three times and also interviewed Satele‘s parents. Esther and Richard split\nup and reconciled many times, and Satele‘s lack of consistent interaction with\nthem, according to Dr. Miles, significantly affected the development of his\nidentity. Satele‘s first memory was of riding a skateboard at about the age of 11;\nalthough he also recalled events between the ages of two and six, Dr. Miles could\nnot be certain these were not ―indirect memor[ies]‖ related to Satele by another\nindividual.\n\n                                          20\n\f     In Dr. Miles‘s view, being in a gang provided defendant Satele a consistent\nenvironment where he was accepted, which he could not get at home. Richard‘s\nphysical punishment of Satele alienated Satele, and left Richard with no effective\nform of discipline when he stopped using it. Although Satele was 20 years old\nwhen Dr. Miles first interviewed him, ―emotionally he was more like 12.‖\nDr. Miles acknowledged that despite Satele‘s emotional immaturity, he knew the\ndifference between right and wrong.\n     Dr. Miles administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory to\ndefendant Satele; the results were ―highly pathological,‖ showing someone in\nturmoil who had identity problems and might be psychotic. He asked for\nadditional testing of Satele by a psychologist, on which Satele scored in the\nborderline range in intelligence, but not low enough to be considered mentally\nretarded. On the Wide Range Achievement Test, Satele scored ―in the average\nrange for someone who is in high school,‖ and reported he took no special classes\nfor the learning disabled. Satele gave few responses on the Rorschach inkblot test,\nwhich can occur when a person is ―overwhelmed by [the ink blots] and excited or\nvery guarded.‖ His responses on the ―Milikin clinical, multi-axle test‖ (sic: most\nlikely the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory) showed ―some turmoil and a\nhistory of some problems with the law.‖\n     According to Dr. Miles, defendant Satele did not have hallucinations.\nDr. Miles believed that at times Satele may have experienced paranoid delusions,\nbut Satele denied doing so. Satele said he generally became ―paranoid when he\nwas up a lot and on . . . amphetamine.‖ He told Dr. Miles he drank heavily and\nused methamphetamine four or five days at a time. According to Dr. Miles, an\nindividual who has experienced paranoia while using amphetamine is more likely\nto become paranoid when using the drug again. Satele said that around the time of\nthe murders he was ―loaded‖ and had not slept for several days.\n\n                                          21\n\f     Dr. Miles concluded that defendant Satele lost control when he was agitated,\nwas impulsive and aggressive, and had turmoil, identity problems, paranoia, low\nself-esteem, and ―fragility.‖ The combined effect of these circumstances left\nSatele with ―less than the average amount of control over impulsiveness,‖ ―prone\nto undue influence[] from others,‖ and more of a follower than a leader. They also\nmade him subject to substance abuse, and when abusing substances to have\n―periodically bad experiences‖ that made him react to others in a hostile fashion.\nDr. Miles diagnosed Satele with amphetamine abuse, alcohol abuse, probable\npsychosis not otherwise specified, and borderline personality disorder.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Pretrial Issues\n\n           1. Excusal of prospective juror based on her death penalty views\n\n               a. Factual background\n     On her juror questionnaire, in response to the question ―In what ways, if any,\nmight your religious views affect your service as a juror in this case,‖ Prospective\nJuror No. 2066 wrote: ―I would not send any person to death. The Bible say[s]\nthou shalt not kill.‖ In response to the question ―Would you, because of any views\nthat you may have concerning capital punishment, refuse to find the defendant\nguilty of first degree murder, even though you personally believe the defendant to\nbe guilty of first degree murder, just to prevent the penalty phase from taking\nplace‖ she wrote, ―I don‘t know yet.‖ When asked whether, because of her views\non capital punishment, she would refuse to find a special circumstance true, even\nthough she personally believed it to be true, ―just to prevent the penalty phase\nfrom taking place,‖ she said, ―No.‖\n     When asked on the questionnaire whether she would ―automatically refuse to\nvote in favor of the penalty of death and automatically vote for a penalty of life\n\n\n                                         22\n\fimprisonment without the possibility of parole,‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 wrote\n―Yes.‖ Asked if she would change her answer to this question if she was\ninstructed and ordered by the court that she must consider and weigh the\naggravating and mitigating factors regarding the facts of the crime and the\nbackground and character of the defendant before voting on the issue of penalty,\nshe wrote, ―I might.‖ In response to the question ―Could you set aside your own\npersonal feelings regarding what the law ought to be and follow the law as the\ncourt explains it to you‖ she wrote, ―I don‘t know if I could.‖ Asked to describe\nher ―general feelings about the death penalty,‖ she wrote, ―I don‘t feel at ease with\nit.‖ When asked to identify the statement ―that best describes your views on the\ndeath penalty,‖ she selected, ―While I am strongly opposed to the death penalty, I\ndo believe there are rare cases where a death sentence should be imposed for a\ndeliberate murder.‖ When asked, ―Can you fairly and impartially listen and weigh\nthe evidence, set aside any moral, religious, or personal views and/or beliefs you\nmay have about the death penalty to render a verdict in accordance with law‖ she\nwrote, ―I don‘t know.‖\n     On voir dire, the trial court asked Prospective Juror No. 2066 what she meant\nby her response of ―I don‘t know yet‖ to the question asking whether her views on\ncapital punishment would cause her to find a defendant not guilty of first degree\nmurder, even if she personally believed him to be guilty, to prevent the penalty\nphase from taking place. She replied: ―Undecided. I would kind of make it\nlenient.‖ The court later asked, ―[I]f you were to sit as a juror in a case in which\nthe death penalty is sought, and you get to the penalty phase, . . . would you be\nable, upon consideration of any aggravating and mitigating factors, to impose the\ndeath penalty if you feel it is warranted? Would you be able to vote for it, in other\nwords?‖ She replied: ―I probably would be hesitant. I wouldn‘t want to vote for\n. . . the death penalty.‖\n\n                                          23\n\f     The prosecutor then said to Prospective Juror No. 2066, ―I think that\ncoincides with your answer . . . where you said, ‗I don‘t feel at ease with it.‘ ‖ She\nreplied, ―Right.‖ The prosecutor began, ―I take it that it‘s such a difficult decision\nfor you —‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 interrupted to say, ―Yes, it is.‖ The\nprosecutor continued ―— that you could not vote for the death penalty?‖ She said,\n―Yes.‖\n     Defendant Nunez‘s counsel asked, ―Is it correct that after you hear all of the\nevidence you will follow the instructions on the law and do what the law requires\nyou to do in this state based upon how you find the facts to be?‖ Prospective Juror\nNo. 2066 replied, ―I‘ll do my best, yes.‖\n     The trial court asked Prospective Juror No. 2066 whether she would\nautomatically exclude the possibility of voting to impose the death penalty if she\nconcluded the facts of the case warranted such a penalty. She replied, ―If there\nwere other alternatives, I would probably . . . look at those first before choosing\nthe death penalty.‖ The court stated there would be only two choices at any\npenalty phase, and asked, ―Would you weigh the evidence to decide which\nalternative between the two you should choose?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066\nreplied, ―Yes.‖ The court subsequently asked, ―And if the evidence on the\naggravation and mitigation warrants that the . . . death penalty should be imposed,\nwould you be able to vote for death, knowing there is a possibility that you could\nchoose life without possibility of parole?‖ She replied, ―Yes.‖\n     The prosecutor explained to Prospective Juror No. 2066 again that her two\nchoices at the penalty phase were voting for the death penalty or for life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, and inquired whether she would\n―automatically vote for the life in prison sentence.‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066\nsaid, ―Yes.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―Even if I put on a bunch of aggravating\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\ffactors about various things, would you still vote for that life sentence?‖ She\nreplied, ―Yes, I think I would.‖\n     Defendant Nunez‘s counsel asked, ―Can you conceive of a crime so heinous\nthat you would ever vote for death?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 responded, ―No,\nI don‘t think so.‖ Counsel subsequently asked, ―If . . . you see there are only two\nalternatives, he goes to prison . . . for the rest of their natural life, or they go up to\nprison to be killed; are you saying you could never, ever, no matter what it was,\nsay, ‗Well, I will vote for death?‘ ‖ She replied, ―Yes, I‘m saying that right now.‖\nCounsel asked, ―You didn‘t say that a minute ago?‖ She said, ―Maybe the\nquestion was presented to me a little different.‖\n     The trial court asked, ―Do you believe that a case could be so bad that you\nwould vote for death?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 replied, ―I believe a case could\nbe that bad, but I still wouldn‘t want to vote the death penalty.‖ The court\nsubsequently asked, ―Is it you couldn‘t or you don‘t want to, or both?‖ She\nreplied, ―Both.‖\n     Defendant Satele‘s counsel asked, ―[I]f you made up your mind that the\ndecision you made up was the prosecution has established to you a belief this\nperson is a really bad person and that person deserves the death penalty, could you\ndo it?‖ Prospective Juror No. 2066 replied, ―It would be hard for me.‖ Counsel\nsaid: ―I understand. It‘s hard for everybody. That is [a] tough decision. Could\nyou?‖ She replied, ―I don‘t know if I could.‖\n     The prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror No. 2066 for cause. The trial\ncourt sustained the challenge, stating: ―This court has examined the juror‘s state\nof mind, particularly the demeanor in this case, and the reluctance of the\nresponses, and the equivocal responses that the juror has had, and the conflicting\nresponses that the juror has had. And this court makes the determination as to the\njuror‘s state of mind, and she is incapable of imposing the death penalty. And the\n\n                                            25\n\freason [is] . . . because of her reluctance to be able to do that when asked her the\nleading question as to whether or not she could impose it under certain\ncircumstances she said, yes; but when asked if there‘s another choice, life\nimprisonment, what would she do, she, without reluctance and without\nequivocation, chose life imprisonment if there‘s a choice. Given that is the case,\nand given her responses in the questionnaire, her demeanor in the court and her\nstate of mind as observed by this court, with multiple inferences that are given, the\ncourt infers based upon her responses that she is not death qualified and excuses\nher for cause.‖\n\n                  b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend that the trial court erroneously excused Prospective Juror\nNo. 2066 based on her views regarding the death penalty, in violation of their\nrights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution.\n     The Attorney General argues that defendants have forfeited their arguments\nbased on the Fifth and Eighth Amendments because, at trial, they did not\nchallenge the trial court‘s excusal of Prospective Juror No. 2066 on these grounds,\nalthough the Attorney General acknowledges that no objection was required to the\nextent defendants‘ challenge is based on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nUnder the law applicable at the time this case was tried, ―an appellate challenge to\na Witherspoon/Witt excusal is not forfeited by a failure to object at trial‖ (People\nv. McKinnon (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637; see Witherspoon v.

(McKinnon, at p. 643.) The rule that no objection was necessary applies\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\fregardless of the constitutional provision on which the challenge is based. We\ntherefore address defendants‘ claims on the merits.\n     ―The federal constitutional standard for dismissing a prospective juror for\ncause based on his or her views of capital punishment is ‗ ―[w]hether the juror‘s\nviews would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a\njuror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v.

Duenas (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10.)\n     Here, Prospective Juror No. 2066 equivocated and gave conflicting responses\nto questions pertaining to her ability to follow the law concerning imposition of\nthe death penalty. On the one hand, she wrote on her juror questionnaire that she\n―would not send any person to death‖ because ―[t]he Bible say[s] thou shalt not\nkill,‖ and that she would refuse to vote in favor of the death penalty and would\nautomatically vote for a penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole because of her views concerning capital punishment. On voir dire, she\nagreed with the prosecutor that she ―could not vote for the death penalty.‖ On the\nother hand, Prospective Juror No. 2066 also answered ―yes,‖ when asked if she\nwould ―weigh the evidence to decide‖ whether to vote for death or life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, and she said she would be ―able to\nvote for death‖ if she concluded that ―the evidence on the aggravation and\nmitigation warrants that the . . . death penalty should be imposed.‖\n     The trial court was in a position, which we are not, to view Prospective Juror\nNo. 2066‘s demeanor, and its determination of her state of mind is binding.\n\n                                           27\n\f―Deference to the trial court is appropriate because it is in a position to assess the\ndemeanor of the venire, and of the individuals who compose it, a factor of critical\nimportance in assessing the attitude and qualifications of potential jurors.‖\n(Uttecht v. Brown, supra, 551 U.S. at p. 9.) ―Hence, the trial judge may be left\nwith the ‗definite impression‘ that the person cannot impartially apply the law\neven though, as is often true, [she] has not expressed [her] views with absolute\nclarity.‖ (People v.

Here, substantial evidence\nsupports the trial court‘s determination that Prospective Juror No. 2066‘s views on\nthe death penalty would prevent or substantially impair her ability to serve as a\njuror.\n     The cases on which defendants rely (People v. Heard (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\nPeople v.

Unlike the\nprospective juror wrongly excused in Heard, Prospective Juror No. 2066 did not\nindicate on voir dire she ―was prepared to follow the law and had no\npredisposition one way or the other as to imposition of the death penalty,‖ nor was\nshe generally ―clear in [her] declarations that [she] would attempt to fulfill [her]\nresponsibilities as a juror in accordance with the court‘s instructions and [her]\noath.‖ (Heard, at p. 967.)\n     Defendant Nunez asserts it is significant that Pearson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\ninvolved the same trial judge as in this case. The trial here occurred before the\ntrial in Pearson. In Pearson, we concluded that the trial court erroneously\nexcused a prospective juror whose views on the death penalty in general were\n―vague and largely unformed‖ (id. at p. 330), but who ―made no conflicting or\nequivocal statements about her ability to vote for a death penalty in a factually\nappropriate case‖ (ibid.). We observed that the trial court had misunderstood and\nmisapplied People v. Guzman (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1181101\"><a href=\"/opinion/1181101/people-v-guzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956 (Guzman) (overruled on\nother grounds in Price v.

The trial court in Pearson\nerroneously stated that, under Guzman, it could excuse a prospective juror because\nthe prospective juror expressed equivocal views about capital punishment in\ngeneral. This view, we explained, was wrong. Guzman, we said, ―does not stand\nfor the idea that a person is substantially impaired for jury service in a capital case\nbecause his or her ideas about the death penalty are indefinite, complicated or\nsubject to qualifications . . . .‖ (Pearson, at p. 331.)\n     Here, defendant Nunez argues that certain comments by the trial court earlier\nin the jury selection process reflect the same misunderstanding of the holding in\nGuzman, supra, 45 Cal.3d at page 956, that it expressed during the trial of\nPearson. Whether or not Nunez is correct, the court‘s explanation for excusing\nProspective Juror No. 2066 does not reflect that misunderstanding. Unlike the\nprospective juror wrongly excused in Pearson, Prospective Juror No. 2066 did not\nmerely express equivocal views about the death penalty in general; rather, she\nmade ―conflicting or equivocal statements about her ability to vote for a death\npenalty in a factually appropriate case.‖ (Pearson, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 330,\nitalics added.) Based on those responses, the trial court found that Prospective\nJuror No. 2066 ―is incapable of imposing the death penalty.‖ This finding was\ntantamount to a finding that her views about the death penalty would\n― ‗ ―substantially impair‖ ‘ ‖ her ability to perform her duties as a juror. (Friend,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 56.) Because substantial evidence supports that finding, the\ntrial court properly excused Prospective Juror No. 2066 for cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f           2. Denial of defense challenge for cause\n     Defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their challenge for\ncause to Prospective Juror No. 8971, who was later sworn as an alternate juror and\neventually served on the penalty jury.2 Defendants forfeited this claim because\ndefendants did not use an available peremptory challenge to remove Prospective\nJuror No. 8971. ― ‗As a general rule, a party may not complain on appeal of an\nallegedly erroneous denial of a challenge for cause because the party need not\ntolerate having the prospective juror serve on the jury; a litigant retains the power\nto remove the juror by exercising a peremptory challenge. Thus, to preserve this\nclaim for appeal we require . . . that a litigant actually exercise a peremptory\nchallenge and remove the prospective juror in question.‘ ‖ (People v. Jones\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45.) Defendants failed to do so, and cannot now complain\nabout the trial court‘s asserted error.\n\n       B. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n           1. Challenge to impeachment of Lawrence Kelly\n\n                a. Factual background\n     Lawrence Kelly testified on behalf of defendant Satele that he had been a\nmember of the West Side Wilmas gang for 12 to 13 years, that he had known\n\n\n2     In this and certain other appellate claims defendants contend the asserted\nerror infringed upon their constitutional rights. In those instances where they did\nnot present constitutional theories below, ―it appears that either (1) the appellate\nclaim is one that required no objection to preserve it, or (2) the new arguments are\nbased on factual or legal standards no different from those the trial court was\nasked to apply, but raise the additional legal consequence of violating the\nConstitution‖ (People v. Loker (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570148\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570148/people-v-loker/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704, fn. 7), and to that\nextent their new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal (ibid.). ―No\nseparate constitutional discussion is required, or provided, when rejection of a\nclaim on the merits necessarily leads to rejection of any constitutional theory or\n‗gloss‘ raised for the first time here.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fdefendant Satele for about two years, and that he had never heard Satele ―use the\n‗N‘ word‖ or display disrespect for Black persons. This testimony contradicted\nevidence introduced by the prosecution that Satele had referred to Blacks as\n―niggers.‖ Kelly also testified that he was present with both defendants at a park\nplayground about midnight on the night of the murders, and he did not hear\ndefendant Satele say, ―We were out looking for niggers,‖ or either defendant say,\n―I think we got one.‖ This contradicted the prosecution‘s evidence that defendants\nmade these statements.\n     On cross-examination, Kelly denied that while at the house of Glenn Phillips,\nKelly had offered a Black person $100 either to testify that West Side Wilmas and\n―African Americans get along,‖ or to say, ―We get along.‖\n     When the prosecutor called Glenn Phillips to testify on rebuttal, defendant\nNunez objected under Evidence Code section 352, and defendant Satele objected\nthat the testimony was irrelevant. Outside the jury‘s presence, the trial court held\na hearing, at which Phillips testified that in November 1999, Lawrence Kelly\nvisited Phillips‘s home, where he spoke to Warren Battle, a Black man who\nworked for Phillips. Kelly asked Battle if he wanted to ―make a hundred bucks,‖\nexplaining that he needed Battle to testify that ―we get along with Black people.‖\nKelly did not say who he meant by the word ―we,‖ but Phillips assumed he was\nreferring to the West Side Wilmas gang.\n     The prosecutor offered Phillips‘s testimony for the purpose of impeaching\nKelly, who had denied offering anyone money to testify. The trial court precluded\nthe prosecutor from asking Phillips whom he thought Kelly was referring to when\nKelly used the word ―we,‖ but it allowed the remainder of the testimony, finding\nthat it directly controverted Kelly‘s testimony, and that its probative value\noutweighed its prejudicial effect. Phillips then testified before the jury regarding\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fKelly‘s statement. His testimony was consistent with his testimony at the\nhearing. (See p. 13, ante.)\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend the trial court should have sustained their objection to\nthe impeaching testimony by witness Phillips, described above in part II.B.1.a.\nWe disagree.\n     ―Rebuttal evidence is relevant and thus admissible if it ‗tend[s] to disprove a\nfact of consequence on which the defendant has introduced evidence.‘ [Citation.]\nThe trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of\nevidence in rebuttal.‖ (People v. Clark (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936; see People v.\nMills (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 [the trial court has ―broad power to control the\npresentation of proposed impeachment evidence‖].) Here, as the trial court\nobserved, Phillips‘s testimony directly contradicted Kelly‘s testimony on the issue\nof whether Kelly had attempted to bribe a witness ―to testify we get along with\nBlack people,‖ and hence was relevant to assessing Kelly‘s credibility as a\nwitness. (See People v. Millwee (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1225884\"><a href=\"/opinion/1225884/people-v-millwee/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 [evidence bearing on a\nwitness‘s credibility is proper rebuttal].) The trial court therefore did not abuse its\ndiscretion in admitting the testimony.\n     Defendants point out that the prosecution made no showing that they\nauthorized or encouraged Kelly to try to influence a witness, and hence the\nevidence could not be used to demonstrate their consciousness of guilt. But the\nevidence was not introduced to show defendants‘ consciousness of guilt, but to\nimpeach Kelly‘s credibility. Defendants argue that Phillips‘s testimony was\nunduly prejudicial because there was ―a high likelihood that the jury [would]\nmisuse the evidence‖ to ―infer consciousness of guilt.‖ Not so. No evidence\nconnected defendants to Kelly‘s bribery attempt, and the jury was instructed that\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f―[i]f you find that an[] effort to procure false or fabricated evidence was made by\nanother person for the defendant‘s benefit, you may not consider that effort as\ntending to show[] the defendant‘s consciousness of guilt unless you also find that\nthe defendant authorized that effort.‖\n     Defendants point out that Kelly‘s testimony that he had never offered money\nto Battle to testify for the defense was first elicited by the prosecution on cross-\nexamination; Kelly had not testified about that subject on direct examination. The\nprosecution, defendants contend, used its cross-examination questions to Kelly for\nthe purpose of creating the necessity for witness Phillips‘s testimony impeaching\nKelly. The trial court, they assert, should have forestalled this tactical maneuver\nby excluding Phillips‘s testimony. Even if we assume for the sake of argument\nthat defendants‘ objection at trial was adequate to preserve this claim, it lacks\nmerit. The prosecutor was free to explore on cross-examination whether Kelly\nhad attempted to bribe a witness because such evidence was relevant to Kelly‘s\ncredibility. Once Kelly denied the event, Phillips‘s testimony was admissible to\nimpeach Kelly. Although defendants are correct that Phillips‘s testimony would\nnot generally have been admissible if Kelly had admitted that the bribery attempt\nconversation had occurred, that does not mean Kelly‘s attempted bribe was a\ncollateral issue.\n     Defendants assert that in closing argument, the prosecutor misstated the\npurpose for which the trial court had admitted Phillips‘s impeaching testimony,\nthereby increasing the likelihood that the testimony would confuse the jury. The\nprosecutor argued: ―Glenn Phillips was called to show you that . . . [Kelly]\noffered an African-American a hundred dollars to say we get along. Is [Kelly] a\nwitness . . . you are going to believe in this courtroom? Somebody that . . . would\ngo to the extent of going up to [an] African-American and say if you go into court\nand say something for us. Mr. Phillips has no axe to grind in here. . . . [Kelly] is\n\n                                          33\n\fthe person who hangs around Glenn Phillips [and] . . . offered a hundred dollars to\na witness to lie in this case. What does that tell you about [Kelly], and his\ntestimony here?‖ The prosecutor also argued, ―I‘ve already spoken about the fact\nthat [Phillips] said [Kelly] bribed an individual with [a] hundred bucks to come in\nhere and lie.‖\n     Defendants did not object to the prosecutor‘s argument at the penalty phase\nor seek an admonition, and no exception to the general rule requiring an objection\nand request for admonition is applicable. The claim is therefore forfeited. (People\nv.

It also lacks merit.\nDefendants point out that in the argument quoted above, the prosecutor claimed\nthat Kelly had tried to bribe a witness. But, defendants assert, Phillips‘s testimony\nwas admitted only to impeach Kelly‘s testimony, not to show that an attempted\nbribe occurred. The prosecutor‘s argument, they reason, most likely caused the\njury to draw the improper inference that defendants had asked Kelly to offer the\nbribe.\n     We see nothing improper in the prosecutor‘s argument, nor is there a\nreasonable likelihood that it would have caused the jury to draw the improper\ninference described above. While the prosecutor was not entitled to invite the jury\nto infer that defendants were responsible for Kelly‘s bribery attempt, nothing in\nthe prosecutor‘s challenged comments asked the jury to draw such an inference.\nThus, contrary to defendants‘ contention, the prosecutor‘s argument was not\nconfusing, did not ask the jury to draw improper inferences, and did not increase\nthe likelihood that they would be prejudiced by Phillips‘s testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f           2. Challenge to evidence on rebuttal that defendant Satele hit an\n              inmate\n\n               a. Factual background\n     During the defense case, Darnell Demery, the husband of defendant Satele‘s\ncousin, testified that he had never heard Satele say anything derogatory about\nBlack persons or ―use the ‗N‘ word.‖ Nor had he seen Satele being aggressive,\nargumentative, or physical with anyone. Satele, Demery claimed, did not have a\nbad temper and got ―along with everybody.‖\n     At sidebar, the prosecutor sought the trial court‘s permission to ask Demery\nif he was aware that defendant Satele had attacked other inmates in jail when those\ninmates were restrained, and whether those incidents would affect his opinion of\nSatele. Satele‘s counsel appeared to note that one victim was Black and the other\nAsian. The trial court precluded this line of cross-examination, finding its\n―probative value outweighed by the prejudicial effect.‖\n     After this ruling, three defense witnesses testified that defendant Satele was\nnot prejudiced against Blacks. Satele‘s father testified that his son had never\nexhibited racial bias and had been taught to ―respect all races and all people.‖\nDr. Lewis Yablonski, the gang expert who had interviewed Satele and several\nother West Side Wilmas gang members, testified that he did not detect any racial\nanimus, and was of the view that Satele had no ―special hostility towards Black\npeople.‖ And Willy Guillory, a teacher at Satele‘s high school and a longtime\nfamily friend, testified that Satele caused no problems at school, had never\nreferred to Black persons as ―niggers,‖ and had never behaved ―against any racial\ncomponent in our society.‖\n     At the end of Guillory‘s testimony on direct examination, the prosecutor\nagain sought to introduce evidence that defendant Satele had assaulted handcuffed\ninmates on two occasions. He argued that these attacks showed racial animus and\n\n\n                                         35\n\fthat Satele had opened the door to the testimony. The trial court allowed the\ninquiry. The prosecutor then asked Guillory if his opinion that Satele treated\npeople of other races appropriately would change if he knew that Satele, while in\njail, had punched a handcuffed Black inmate in the face. Guillory said he would\n―find that highly unusual.‖ The prosecutor then asked, ―What happens if I also\ntold you‖ that Satele had slugged an inmate who was handcuffed to another\ninmate. Guillory responded, ―I would say it‘s . . . not the young man I knew . . . in\nhigh school.‖\n     On rebuttal, the prosecution called Deputy Larry Arias, who testified that on\nNovember 9, 1999, he was escorting a Black inmate named Keys in the Men‘s\nCentral Jail. Keys was ―waist chained‖ and could not raise his hands to his face.\nDefendant Satele punched Keys in the face, and Keys fell to the ground. Keys had\nnot provoked the attack. In Deputy Arias‘s opinion, Satele would improve his\nstanding within the Hispanic gangs in jail by attacking a Black man.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendant Satele contends that Deputy Arias‘s testimony should have been\npresented in the prosecution‘s case-in-chief, and was therefore improper rebuttal.\nHe did not raise this objection at trial, and the claim is therefore forfeited on\nappeal. (See People v. Williams (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219693\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219693/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667, fn. 4 [―It is the\ngeneral rule . . . that questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be\nreviewed on appeal absent a specific and timely objection at trial on the ground\nsought to be urged on appeal‖].)\n     On the merits, it is improper for a prosecutor to withhold ―crucial evidence\nproperly belonging in the case-in-chief‖ (Friend, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 44; see\nalso People v. Carter (1957) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1212276\"><a href=\"/opinion/1212276/people-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753), and to present it in rebuttal to\ntake unfair advantage of a defendant. Here, the information contained a special\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fcircumstance allegation that defendant Satele intentionally killed the victims\nbecause of their race, and enhancement allegations that he committed the murders\nin concert because of race, although the jury ultimately found the allegations not\ntrue. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(16), § 422.75, former subd. (c), now subd. (b).) Although\nevidence that Satele had without apparent provocation assaulted a Black inmate\nwas relevant to these allegations, it cannot properly be characterized as ―crucial\nevidence‖ on the issue of his racial animus. Moreover, any error in admitting\nDeputy Arias‘s testimony on rebuttal was harmless under any standard, because\nthe jury found not true the hate crime special circumstances and the allegations\nthat Satele committed the murders in concert because of race.\n     Defendant Satele contends that Deputy Arias‘s testimony that Satele attacked\na Black inmate had little probative value in rebutting testimony by defense\nwitnesses that he got along well with Blacks, because the prosecution offered no\nevidence that the attack was racially motivated. By contrast, he argues, the\ntestimony was unduly prejudicial because it showed his commission of a crime\nand tended to demonstrate his future dangerousness. Thus, he reasons, the trial\ncourt should have sustained his objection to the testimony on the ground that its\npotential prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. (Evid. Code, § 352.)\nWe disagree. Deputy Arias testified that Satele, without warning and completely\nwithout provocation, attacked a defenseless Black inmate. Because the attack\nresembled the murders with which defendants were charged, which also occurred\nin an unprovoked attack on defenseless Black victims, the jury could infer that it\nwas racially motivated. The prejudicial effect of the assault, in which the inmate\nwas apparently not seriously hurt, was minimal when contrasted to the murders\nwith which Satele was charged. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its broad\ndiscretion under Evidence Code section 352 when it ruled that the probative value\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fof Deputy Arias‘s testimony about the attack was not substantially outweighed by\nits prejudicial effect.\n     Defendant Satele contends that the trial court erred by failing to state that it\nhad weighed the probative value and prejudicial effect of Deputy Arias‘s\ntestimony when it overruled his objection to the evidence. He is wrong: A trial\ncourt is not required to ― ‗expressly weigh prejudice against probative value or\neven expressly state that it has done so, if the record as a whole shows the court\nwas aware of and performed its balancing function under Evidence Code section\n352.‘ ‖ (People v. Lewis (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801755\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801755/people-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1285.) Here, the record shows\nthat the trial court properly performed this task. Indeed, the trial court had\npreviously precluded the prosecutor from asking Demery, the husband of\ndefendant Satele‘s cousin, about the incident on cross-examination in the defense\ncase because the court found its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice.\n(See p. 35, ante.)\n\n            3. Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n     Both defendants contend that the prosecutor committed misconduct during\nclosing argument.\n     ―A prosecutor commits misconduct when his or her conduct either infects the\ntrial with such unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a denial of due\nprocess, or involves deceptive or reprehensible methods employed to persuade the\ntrier of fact.‖ (People v. Avila (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2537905\"><a href=\"/opinion/2537905/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711.) ―As a general rule a\ndefendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a\ntimely fashion—and on the same ground—the defendant made an assignment of\nmisconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the\nimpropriety.‖ (Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f                 a. Asserted vouching by the prosecutor\n     Here, in closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor said: ―He [Ernie\nVasquez] identified Curly [Caballero] as the driver of that Buick. Isn‘t it amazing\nthat Curly just happened to be with Speedy and [Wilbone] earlier and it was\nbrought out that he was with them later, that Ernie Vasquez hit the nail on the\nhead? He identified Curly. What a coincidence. Because I guarantee that is the\ntruth. What he testified to was corroborated.‖ (Italics added.) Defendant Nunez\nobjected to the ―district attorney‘s guarantee that is the truth.‖ The trial court said:\n―Your objection is improper argument. Please make a legal basis. Sustained.\nCarry on.‖ Defendants did not request an admonition.\n     In defendant Satele‘s closing argument, his counsel asserted that much of the\ntape recording of defendants‘ conversation while they were being transported in\nthe van to and from court (see pp. 4-5, ante) was inaudible. In rebuttal, the\nprosecutor said: ―[A]ll you have to do is listen to his own words. Listen to Daniel\nNunez‘[s] own words track 2 at 2250, you will hear[.] [D]efendant‘s counsel says\nyou can‘t hear this stuff on the CD. You will hear it. I will back up my words.\nYou will hear this. You will hear him say, I want Black and then he thinks a – no\nBlacks. . . . What does that tell you about his feeling? We know what‘s going on\nin this mind of his. They can‘t justify it. The only way they can justify it you\nwon‘t hear that on the CD. I will stake my reputation on it. You listen [to] that\ntape, that CD at that point, and you will hear it.‖ (Italics added.) The trial court\nsustained defendant Nunez‘s objection to the ―guarantee by the district attorney.‖\nDefendants did not ask the court to admonish the jury to disregard the comment.\nThe prosecutor later said, ―[W]hen I was talking about the CD tape and transcript,\nyou listen to it. . . . I shouldn‘t say I sta[k]e my reputation. You be the judge[.]\n[Y]ou . . . . [l]isten you . . . judge for yourself.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\f     Defendants contend that the prosecutor‘s comments were misconduct\nbecause he relied on his personal beliefs. (See People v. Medina (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127426/people-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776 [―prosecutors should not purport to rely in jury argument on their\noutside experience or personal beliefs based on facts not in evidence‖].)\nDefendants failed to seek an admonition as to either statement, no exception to the\ngeneral rule requiring a request for admonition is applicable, and the claim is\ntherefore forfeited on appeal. (Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.) Moreover,\nthe comments were not prejudicial: In both instances, the prosecutor explained\nthat the evidence in the record supported his view, the trial court sustained defense\nobjections to the challenged comments, and the prosecutor later told the jury as to\nhis argument about the CD, ―I shouldn‘t say I sta[k]e my reputation.‖\n\n                b. Asserted inconsistent arguments\n     Defendant Satele asserts the prosecutor committed misconduct when, after\narguing at the guilt phase that he did not know and had not proven who fired the\nmurder weapon, he argued at the penalty phase that defendant Satele was the\nshooter. Satele claims that as ―a result of this shift in theory, the prosecutor used\nfacts to increase [Satele‘s] culpability without proving those facts first in the guilt\nphase.‖\n     At the guilt phase, the prosecutor said in closing argument to the jury: ―You\nheard the testimony of Julie Rodriguez . . . [about] what they do when they\ncommit driveby murders like this. They have a driver, they have a shooter, and\nthey have people in the back to look for law enforcement, to look for\nwitnesses. . . . I will be the first one to tell you that I did not prove to you who the\nactual shooter was. Whether it was defendant Nunez or defendant Satele. But you\nknow they were in the car. An[d] whether they‘re in the backseat, the front seat,\nthe driver‘s seat, all three of those individuals knew what was going down that day\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\fand participated in this murder.‖ The prosecutor later argued: ―What happened?\nWe know at that point the Buick Regal . . . is going southbound on Frampton.\nCurly [Caballero] is driving — from the evidence, remember, Ernie [Vasquez]\nthought [defendant Satele] was in the front passenger seat. . . . [T]he person in the\nrear he thought looked like Speedy [defendant Nunez], or he resembled Speedy.\nSo let‘s go with it that way.‖\n     At the penalty phase, the prosecutor in closing argument to the jury discussed\nthe mitigating factor described in section 190.3, factor (j), which allows a jury to\nconsider, in deciding whether to impose a sentence of death, ―[w]hether or not the\ndefendant was an accomplice to the offense and his participation in the\ncommission of the offense was relatively minor.‖ The prosecutor said: ―[W]hat\nwere the roles of the defendants in the murdering of Edward and Renesha? . . . .\nNeither of these defendants . . . had a role which was minor. They were all major\nparticipants in this crime. . . . You . . . remember Ms. Rodriguez told you what\nhappens in a driveby shooting.‖ He noted that Vasquez had testified the driver\nwas Caballero, and that as for the person in the passenger seat who was the\nshooter, the prosecutor argued: ―The evidence . . . points to defendant Satele.‖\nThe prosecutor said that Contreras had heard defendant Satele say, ―I shot the\nBlack guy and that Black girl,‖ and reminded the jury of Vasquez‘s testimony that\nthe person in the passenger seat resembled Satele, and the person in the backseat\nresembled defendant Nunez. The prosecutor then asserted that even if defendant\nNunez was in the backseat, his role as a lookout for the police and for any\nwitnesses was not minor.\n     Defendant Satele did not object to the prosecutor‘s argument at the penalty\nphase or seek an admonition, and no exception to the general rule requiring an\nobjection and admonition request is applicable. The claim is therefore forfeited.\n(Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.) It is also meritless because the arguments\n\n                                         41\n\fat the guilt and penalty phases were not inconsistent. Rather, at both phases of\ntrial the prosecutor observed that the evidence, although inconclusive, indicated\nthat defendant Satele was most likely the shooter. At the penalty phase the\nprosecutor simply sought to persuade the jury that if it found defendant Nunez was\nin the backseat of the vehicle, this did not mean his participation was minor within\nthe meaning of section 190.3, factor (j). No misconduct occurred.\n\n           4. Challenge to gang enhancement instruction\n\n                a. Factual background\n     The prosecution alleged, as sentence enhancements to the murders charged in\ncounts 1 and 2 of the amended information, that defendants committed the\nmurders in violation of section 186.22‘s subdivision (b)(1) (section 186.22(b)(1),\nsometimes referred to as the gang enhancement). The gang enhancement provides\nfor an increased sentence when the underlying felony was committed ―for the\nbenefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with\nthe specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang\nmembers.‖ (Ibid.)\n     At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that West Side Wilmas gang\nmembers other than defendants had committed crimes. Detective Dinlocker\ntestified that Ruben Figueroa and Brian Dominic Martinez were West Side\nWilmas gang members, and the prosecution introduced records of Martinez‘s\nconviction for assault with a firearm and Figueroa‘s convictions for murder and\nassault with a deadly weapon.\n     During the guilt phase instruction conference, the trial court proposed to\ninstruct the jury with CALJIC No. 6.50, stating that this instruction concerned the\n―gang crime.‖ CALJIC No. 6.50 does not describe the elements of the gang\nenhancement with which defendants were charged, set forth in section\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f186.22(b)(1); instead, it gives the elements of a crime described in section\n186.22‘s subdivision (a) (hereafter the gang crime), which makes it a felony to\n―actively participate[] in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members\nengage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.‖\n     Defendant Satele‘s counsel said he did not object to the proposed instruction.\nThe prosecutor argued that the ―pattern of criminal gang activity‖ described in the\ninstruction should include what he referred to as Brian Dominic Martinez‘s\nconviction for assault with a deadly weapon,3 and Ruben Figueroa‘s convictions\nfor murder and assault with a deadly weapon. In response, Nunez‘s counsel\nunsuccessfully objected that the evidence did not show ―the necess[ary]\nrequirement[s],‖ presumably for the pattern of gang activity.\n     When the trial court read CALJIC No. 6.50 to the jury, it began: ―Defendant\nis accused in counts one and two of having violated section 186.22(a) of the Penal\nCode, a crime. Every person who actively participates . . . is guilty of the\nviolation of Penal Code section 186.22(a), a crime.‖ The prosecutor asked, ―That\nshould be subdivision b, as in boy?‖ The court replied, ―I‘m sorry, subdivision b.‖\nThe court then repeated this portion of the instruction, inserting the letter ―(b)‖\ninstead of ―(a)‖ throughout.4 In the written instructions, which the jury received,\nthe ―(a)‖ in ―section 186.22, subdivision (a)‖ was replaced by hand with ―(b).‖\n\n3     Martinez was actually convicted of assault with a firearm (§ 245, subd.\n(a)(2)), not assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)).\n4     The trial court instructed the jury: ―Defendant is accused in counts one and\ntwo of having violated section 186[].22(b) of the Penal Code, a crime. Every\nperson who actively participates in any criminal street gang with knowledge that\nthe members are engaged in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity,\nand who willfully promotes[,] furthers[,] or assists in any felonious criminal\nconduct by members of that gang is guilty of the violation of Penal Code section\n186.22(b[])[,] [a] crime. [¶] ‗Pattern of criminal gang activity‘ means the\ncommission of or attempted commission or solicitation of sustained juvenile\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      In his closing argument, the prosecutor asserted: ―[T]here‘s an allegation\nwhich we proved under 186.22 called a gang allegation, that this crime was\ncommitted for the benefit of West Side Wilmas. And it was.‖ The prosecutor also\nsaid that under the gang allegation he was required to prove several elements,\nincluding a pattern of criminal gang activity. To do so, he relied on Figueroa‘s\nmurder and assault with a deadly weapon convictions, and Martinez‘s ―assault\nwith a firearm, which is a deadly weapon‖ conviction. He also asserted: ―The last\nelement of that gang allegation is that this crime was committed for the benefit of\nthat gang. You heard me question Julie Rodriguez. She testified it was, in her\nopinion. You also can see it from People‘s 43 [which included a photograph of\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\npetition for, or conviction of two or more of the following crimes, namely murder\nand assault with [a] deadly weapon, provided at least one of those crimes occurred\nafter September 23, 1988, and the last of those crimes occurred within three years\nafter a prior offense, and the crimes are committed on separate occasions [or] by\ntwo or more persons. [¶] ‗Criminal street gang‘ means any ongoing . . .\nassociation or group of three or more persons[,] whether formal or informal,\nhaving as one of [its] primary activities, 1. the commission of one or more . . . of\nthe following criminal acts, murder and assault with a deadly weapon; 2. having a\ncommon name or common identifying sign or symbol; and 3. whose members\nindividually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal\ngang activity. [¶] Active participation means that the person, 1. must have a\ncurrent relationship with the criminal street gang that is more than in name only[,]\npassive, inactive or purely technical, and 2. must devote all or a substantial part of\nhis time or efforts to the criminal street gang. [¶] Felonious criminal conduct\nincludes murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon. In order to prove this crime\neach of the following elements must be proved: 1. A person actively and\ncurrently participates in a criminal street gang; 2. The members of that gang\nengage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity; 3. That person\nknew that the gang members engaged [in] or have engaged in a pattern of criminal\ngang activity; and 4. That person aided and abetted a member of that gang in\ncommitting the crimes of murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon.‖ (See\nCALJIC No. 6.50 (6th ed. 1999 rev.).)\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fgraffiti] [and] from the actions of Wilbone against Mr. Keys that they did this to\npromote their gang.‖ The jury found the gang enhancement allegations to be true.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend that the gang enhancement findings should be vacated\nbecause the trial court committed prejudicial error by instructing the jury on the\nelements of the gang crime (§ 186.22, subd. (a)) when they were charged with the\ngang enhancement (§ 186.22(b)(1)). We agree.\n     The trial court‘s instruction (see p. 43, fn. 4, ante) told the jury that the\ncharged gang enhancements (erroneously referred to by the instruction as\n―crimes‖) contained four elements: ―1. A person actively and currently\nparticipates in a criminal street gang; 2. The members of that gang engage in or\nhave engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity; 3. That person knew that the\ngang members engaged [in] or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity;\nand 4. That person aided and abetted a member of that gang in committing the\ncrimes of murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon.‖ This list omitted two\nelements of the gang enhancements charged in the amended information. First,\nthe instruction did not tell the jury that to find the enhancements true, it must find\nthat defendants committed the murders ―for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in\nassociation with any criminal street gang‖ (§ 186.22(b)(1)); second, the instruction\ndid not tell the jury that to find the enhancements true, it must find that defendants\ncommitted the murders ―with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in\nany criminal conduct by gang members‖ (ibid.).\n     The Attorney General claims that the jury was adequately instructed on the\nelements of the gang enhancements. As explained below, her arguments are not\npersuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f     As to the element that the crimes charged were committed for the benefit of,\nat the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang, the Attorney\nGeneral notes that the instruction required that the jury find ―active participation‖\nin a criminal street gang, which the instruction defined as ―a current relationship\nwith the criminal street gang that is more than in name only[,] passive, inactive or\npurely technical,‖ in which the defendant devoted ―all or a substantial part of his\ntime or efforts‖ to the gang.5 She asserts that this portion of the instruction —\ntogether with the reasonable doubt instruction and the instruction to consider the\ninstructions as a whole — required the jury ―to deduce that to find the gang\ncharges true, there had to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendants] . . .\ncommitted the murders ‗in association with‘ their gang.‖ But there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury would not have understood the instruction as requiring it to\nmake such a finding. The portion of the instruction concerning active\nparticipation simply addresses a defendant‘s level of involvement with the street\ngang, not whether the defendant committed the charged crimes for the benefit of,\nat the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang.\n     The Attorney General asserts that the trial court‘s instruction said, in essence,\nthat the jury could consider proof that the defendants committed the charged\nmurders as evidence of a ―pattern of gang activity.‖ According to the Attorney\nGeneral, this portion of the instruction, considered in combination with the\nreasonable doubt instruction, told the jury it could find the gang enhancements\ntrue only if it found ―evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged murders\n\n\n5     After the trial in this case, we held that the language ―actively participates in\nany criminal street gang‖ in section 186.22(a) means ―involvement with a criminal\nstreet gang that is more than nominal or passive.‖ (People v.

The portion\nof the instruction mentioned by the Attorney General did not mention the charged\nmurders; rather, it told the jury it could consider ―murder and assault with [a]\ndeadly weapon‖ as evidence of a ― ‗pattern of criminal gang activity.‘ ‖ But the\nprosecutor expressly relied on the convictions of Figueroa and Martinez for\nmurder and assault with a deadly weapon — and not the charged murders — to\nshow the requisite pattern of activity. Moreover, even if the jury understood this\nportion of the instruction as referring to the charged murders as well as those\nconvictions, the instruction did not tell the jury that it must find that the charged\nmurders were gang related in order to find the enhancements true.\n     The Attorney General argues that the trial court‘s instruction told the jury to\nfind each gang enhancement true only if the evidence showed ―beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the defendant ‗aided and abetted‘ a fellow gang member in\ncommitting the charged murder.‖ The Attorney General is incorrect. The court\ninstructed the jury that ―[i]n order to prove this crime‖ (by which the court meant\nthe gang enhancements), several elements ―must be proved,‖ one of which was\nthat a ―person aided and abetted a member of that gang in committing the crimes\nof murder and assault with [a] deadly weapon.‖ The prosecutor expressly relied\non the convictions of Figueroa and Martinez for murder and assault with a deadly\nweapon to show a pattern of criminal gang activity, and the phrase ―murder and\nassault with [a] deadly weapon‖ was repeated throughout the instruction. There is\na reasonable likelihood that the jury interpreted this phrase as referring only to\nthose convictions; indeed, defendants were not charged with assault with a deadly\nweapon. Nor is it dispositive that the prosecutor asserted ―[t]he last element of\nthat gang allegation is that this crime was committed for the benefit of that gang.‖\nThe court had already instructed the jury before closing argument that ―[i]f\n\n                                          47\n\fanything concerning the law said by the attorneys in their arguments or at any\nother time during the trial conflicts with my instructions on the law, you must\nfollow my instructions.‖\n     As to the specific intent element of section 186.22(b)(1) (that is, the\nrequirement that the prosecution prove that the charged crimes were committed\nwith the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by\ngang members), the Attorney General contends this element was adequately\naddressed when the trial court instructed the jury that the enhancement required\nproof that a defendant ―willfully promote[d][,] further[ed][,] or assist[ed] in any\nfelonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.‖ (Italics added.) Although\nthe Attorney General acknowledges that ― ‗willfully‘ in a penal statute usually\ndefines a general criminal intent‖ (People v.

The court instructed the jury that the gang crime contained several\nelements that ―must be proved,‖ one of which was that the defendant ―aided and\nabetted a member of that gang in committing the crimes of murder and assault\nwith [a] deadly weapon.‖ As previously explained (see p. 47, ante), this language\nappears to refer to the murder and assault with a deadly weapon convictions of\nFigueroa and Martinez, not to the murders in this case. Thus, there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury construed the instruction as not requiring it to find that\ndefendants committed the charged murders with the specific intent to promote,\nfurther, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.

Thus, the jury was not instructed that to find the\nenhancement allegations true, it must find that defendants committed the murders\n―for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street\ngang‖ (§ 186.22(b)(1)). Nor was it instructed that it must find that defendants\ncommitted the murders ―with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nerror violated only state law. In October 1998, when the murders in this case were\ncommitted, the finding of a gang enhancement as to a felony punishable by\nimprisonment for life resulted in the defendant being ineligible for parole until\nserving ―a minimum of 15 calendar years‖ in prison. (Former § 186.22,\nsubd. (b)(4); as amended by Stats. 1997, ch. 500, § 2, p. 3125.) By contrast, the\ncrime to which the gang enhancements apply here — first degree murder — was\npunishable by death, by imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, or\nby a prison term of ―25 years to life‖ (§ 190, subd. (a)), for which the defendant\nwas ineligible for parole before serving a minimum of 25 years in prison (§ 190,\nsubd.

Thus, the\ngang enhancement‘s mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years did not increase\nthe statutory minimum sentence for the murders. As a result, the trial court‘s\ninstructional error as to the gang enhancement did not violate defendants‘ Sixth\nAmendment right to jury trial.\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\fany criminal conduct by gang members.‖ (Ibid.) Furthermore, as we have\nexplained, no other instruction addressed these elements.\n       The most important difference between the gang enhancement alleged\nagainst defendants and the gang crime on which they were instructed is that,\nunlike the gang crime, the gang enhancement can be found true only if the\nunderlying felony to which the enhancement applies — here, the two murders\ncommitted by defendants — is itself gang related. (See People v. Livingston\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1170 [―[T]he enhancement applies ‗only if the crime is\n―gang related.‖ ‘ [Citation.] ‗Not every crime committed by gang members is\nrelated to a gang.‘ ‖].) Both defendants in this case were indisputably members of\na criminal street gang (the West Side Wilmas), but, as discussed below, the\nevidence did not clearly show that the murders were gang related.\n       The prosecution theorized that the murders were gang related because they\nwere racially motivated. Los Angeles Police Officer Julie Rodriguez, testifying as\na gang expert who specialized in the West Side Wilmas gang, explained that in her\nopinion the West Side Wilmas ―don‘t care for African Americans living in‖ their\nterritory, and that ―they don‘t want any African Americans to share the\nneighborhood with them.‖ Defendants, in her view, believed that ―eliminating\nAfrican Americans within their community‖ would ―better the gang,‖ which had\nan ―unwritten rule‖ that gang members must take advantage of ―any opportunity\nthat they have . . . to attack an African American.‖\n       The prosecution presented considerable evidence that the murders were\nracially motivated: Prosecution witnesses testified that both defendants had\ndescribed the victims after the murders with words strongly suggesting prejudice\nagainst African-Americans, and that shortly after the murders defendant Satele\nsaid that defendants had been ―out looking for niggers.‖ The jury, however,\nrejected the prosecution‘s theory of a racially motivated killing, because it found\n\n                                         51\n\fspecial circumstance allegations that defendants intentionally killed the victims\nbecause of their race not to be true. By rejecting this theory, the jury implicitly\nrejected the prosecution‘s theory — described in the previous paragraph — that\nthe killings were gang related because they were racially motivated.\n       Prosecution witness Ernie Vasquez testified that defendant Nunez told him\nthat Nunez had been driving down the street when one of the victims ―looked at\nhim wrong,‖ so Nunez ―turned back around and blasted‖ the victim. This\ntestimony, if credited by the jury, could have caused it to conclude that the\nmurders were not gang-related, racially motivated killings. Thus, if the jury had\nbeen properly instructed that it could find the gang enhancements true only if it\nfound that defendants committed the murders ―for the benefit of, at the direction\nof, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to\npromote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members‖\n(§ 186.22(b)(1)), the jury might well have found the gang enhancement allegations\nnot to be true.\n       Because, for the reasons described above, there is ―serious doubt as to\nwhether the error has affected the result‖ (People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n837), the trial court‘s instructional error pertaining to the gang enhancement\nallegations was prejudicial. We therefore vacate the gang enhancement findings\nfor each defendant.\n\n           5. Challenge to firearm use enhancement true findings\n     Defendants contend that we must vacate the jury‘s true findings on the\nsentence enhancement allegations for personal firearm use, because those findings\ndepended on the jury first finding true the gang enhancement allegations, on which\nthe jury was erroneously instructed. (See pt. II.B.4, ante.) We agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\f     As to each defendant, the amended information alleged firearm use\nenhancements under former section 12022.53‘s subdivision (d) (section\n12022.53(d)) for both murders.7 The trial court instructed the jury that the\n―allegation pursuant to Penal Code section 12022.53(d) applies to any person\ncharged as a principal in the commission of an offense, when a violation of Penal\nCode section 12022.53(d) and 186.22(b) are pled and proved.‖ During closing\nargument to the jury, when discussing the firearm use allegations, the prosecutor\nsaid: ―I told you . . . that I did not prove to you which of the two defendants\npersonally used a gun. So you‘re going to say, ‗I‘m going to find that allegation\nnot true, because [the prosecutor] did not prove who personally shot the gun.‘ But\nif you look in that instruction . . . there‘s a paragraph that . . . says . . . that gang\nmembers are vicariously liable. They are all liable for that personal use if that gun\nhas been intentionally discharged and proximately caused death and there is a\ngang allegation that has been pled and proven. I‘ve told you I pled and proved\n\n7      At the time of the murders, section 12022.53 provided in relevant part:\n        ―(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who is\nconvicted of a felony specified in subdivision (a) [murder is a specified\nfelony], . . ., and who in the commission of that felony intentionally and personally\ndischarged a firearm and proximately caused great bodily injury, . . . or death, to\nany person other than an accomplice, shall be punished by a term of imprisonment\nof 25 years to life in the state prison, which shall be imposed in addition and\nconsecutive to the punishment prescribed for that felony.\n     ―(e)(1) The enhancements specified in this section shall apply to any person\ncharged as a principal in the commission of an offense that includes an allegation\npursuant to this section when a violation of both this section and subdivision (b) of\nSection 186.22 are pled and proved.\n      ―(2) An enhancement for participation in a criminal street gang pursuant to\nChapter 11 (commencing with Section 186.20) of Title 7 of Part 1, shall not be\nimposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this\nsubdivision, unless the person personally used or personally discharged a firearm\nin the commission of the offense.‖ (As amended by Stats. 1998, ch. 936, § 19; see\nid., §§ 19.5, 27, 36, pp. 6899-6900, 6919, 6922.)\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\fthat, because I proved that Dominic Martinez, Ruben Figueroa — we had Julie\nRodriguez. So that gang allegation is proven. Because of that gang allegation,\nthey are both liable for that personal use of the gun. So I don‘t want that word\n‗personal‘ to throw you off. When you go back there and it says, ‗We, the jury,\nfind the allegation that the defendants personally, intentionally used a firearm . . .\nto be true or not true,‘ please circle the true.‖\n     The trial court‘s instructions and the prosecutor‘s argument relieved the jury\nof the obligation to determine who personally used the murder weapon if it found\ntrue the gang enhancement allegations under section 186.22(b)(1). Although the\njury may have found that one or both defendants personally used the murder\nweapon, the instructions permitted the jury to simply conclude that because it had\nfound the gang enhancement allegations to be true, it did not need to decide who\npersonally used the weapon; indeed, the prosecutor specifically urged the jury to\nadopt this approach. Thus, we cannot tell whether the jury found the section\n12022.53(d) allegations true because it found true the section 186.22(b)(1)\nallegations (a legally invalid theory because the jury was misinstructed on the\nelements of the gang enhancement allegations) or because it found that each\ndefendant personally shot the two victims (a legally valid theory). We therefore\nvacate the firearm use findings as to both defendants. (See People v.

Therefore, they assert, the\nculpability of an aider or abettor can sometimes be either greater or less than, but\nnot equal to, the culpability of the direct perpetrator, and the jury should have been\nso instructed. Defendants are not entitled to reversal on this ground.\n     In McCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at page 1120, we observed that by making\n―aiders and abettors liable for their accomplices‘ actions as well as their own,‖ the\naider and abettor doctrine ―obviates the necessity to decide who was the aider and\nabettor and who the direct perpetrator or to what extent each played which role.‖\nWe noted that ―outside of the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider\nand abettor‘s mental state must be at least that required of the direct perpetrator.‖\n(Id. at p. 1118.) When the crime is murder, McCoy said, the ―aider and abettor\nmust know and share the murderous intent of the actual perpetrator.‖ (Ibid.)\nBecause an aider and abettor‘s ―guilt is based on a combination of the direct\nperpetrator‘s acts and the aider and abettor‘s own acts and own mental state‖ (id. at\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fp. 1117), McCoy also held that ―sometimes‖ an ―aider and abettor may be guilty of\ngreater homicide-related offenses than those the actual perpetrator committed‖\nbecause of ―defenses or extenuating circumstances . . . that are personal to the\nactual perpetrator and do not apply to the aider and abettor.‖ (Id. at p. 1114.)8 In\nConcha, two codefendants and an accomplice tried to murder a man during an\napparent robbery, and the man responded by killing the accomplice. (Concha,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 658.) We held that each defendant could be liable for the\nfirst degree murder of the accomplice under the ―provocative act murder doctrine‖\nonly ―if the defendant personally acted willfully, deliberately, and with\npremeditation during the attempted murder.‖ (Ibid., italics added.)\n     Here, however, neither defendant asserts a defense theory or points to\nextenuating circumstances that might have led the jury to find that one defendant‘s\nindividual culpability was less than that of the other defendant, nor does the\nevidence at trial suggest any such defense or circumstances. Rather, defendants\nsimply speculate that they ―may have had different levels of culpability.‖ Under\nthe circumstances, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was confused or\nmisled by the trial court‘s instruction that the aider and abettor and the direct\nperpetrator were ―equally guilty.‖\n\n\n8      Following our decision in McCoy, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2514185\"><a href=\"/opinion/2514185/people-v-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, CALJIC No. 3.00\nwas modified for cases in which there is evidence that the guilt of the aider and\nabettor might be different from that of the direct perpetrator. In those\ncircumstances, the current instruction substitutes the language ―guilty of a crime‖\nfor the language ―equally guilty,‖ and further provides: ―When the crime charged\nis [either] [murder] [or] [attempted murder] . . . , the aider and abettor‘s guilt is\ndetermined by the combined acts of all the participants as well as that person‘s\nown mental state. If the aider and abettor‘s mental state is more culpable than that\nof the actual perpetrator, that person‘s guilt may be greater than that of the actual\nperpetrator. Similarly, the aider and abettor‘s guilt may be less than the\nperpetrator‘s, if the aider and abettor has a less culpable mental state.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f           7. Challenge to multiple-murder special-circumstance instruction\n     The trial court instructed the jury that if it found that either defendant was an\naccomplice to the murders but was not the actual killer, or if it was unable to\ndecide whether a defendant was the actual killer or an aider and abettor, it could\nnot find the multiple-murder special-circumstance allegations true as to that\ndefendant unless he acted with either one of two mental states: (1) the ―defendant\nwith the intent to kill aided, abetted, counseled, commanded[,] induced, solicited,\nrequested, or assisted any actor in the commission of the murder in the first\ndegree‖ or (2) the defendant ―with reckless indifference to human life and as a\nmajor participant aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced[,] solicited[,]\nrequested, or assisted in the commission of the crime of Penal Code section\n190.2(a)(3) . . . which resulted in the death of a human being.‖ Both defendants\ncontend that the trial court prejudicially erred in giving the second portion of this\ninstruction because it permitted the jury to find the multiple-murder special-\ncircumstance allegations true as to a defendant who was not the actual killer\nwithout finding that the defendant acted with the intent to kill.9 We agree that the\n\n9     This was the instruction given by the trial court on the multiple-murder\nspecial-circumstance allegations: ―If you find a defendant in this case guilty of\nmurder of the first degree, you must then determine if one or more of the\nfollowing special circumstances are true or not true . . . .

(Id. at p. 790.) We also noted that the deficiencies in the aiding and\nabetting instructions were ameliorated because the defendant at trial denied he in\nany way aided in the killing, leaving ―no way for the jury to find that he ‗aided‘\nthe killing only ‗accidentally‘ or ‗unintentionally.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 790; see id. at\npp. 776-777.)\n     Here, as in Hardy, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2618245\"><a href=\"/opinion/2618245/people-v-hardy/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Garrison, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1170932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1170932/people-v-garrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nthe jury necessarily found under other properly given instructions that any\ndefendant that it convicted of murder on a theory of aiding and abetting possessed\nthe intent to kill.

(See People v. Beeman (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1247976\"><a href=\"/opinion/1247976/people-v-beeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 [―an aider and abettor will ‗share‘ the perpetrator‘s specific intent\nwhen he or she knows the full extent of the perpetrator‘s criminal purpose and\ngives aid or encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating the\nperpetrator‘s commission of the crime‖].)\n     The evidence at trial demonstrated that murder victims Fuller and Robinson\nsuffered their fatal injuries when they were each hit by multiple shots fired in a\ndriveby shooting by a perpetrator using an AK-47-type assault rifle loaded with\narmor-penetrating bullets. These circumstances demonstrate that the actual\nperpetrator acted with the intent to kill, and did not kill accidentally or\ninadvertently. As previously noted (see pp. 55-56, ante), defendants do not assert,\nand the evidence at trial does not reveal, any defense or extenuating circumstances\nthat might have warranted a finding by the jury that one defendant‘s individual\nculpability was less than that of the other defendant. On these facts, and given the\ninstructions described in the previous paragraph, the jury here must necessarily\nhave found that any defendant that it convicted of murder as an accomplice acted\nwith the intent to kill.\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\f           8. Trial court’s failure to instruct on its own motion on implied\n              malice murder\n     The trial court instructed the jury that to constitute murder a killing must be\nunlawful and done with malice aforethought, and it defined both express and\nimplied malice. The court then instructed the jury on three forms of first degree\nmurder: premeditated and deliberate murder, murder by knowing use of armor-\npenetrating ammunition, and murder by intentionally discharging a firearm from a\nmotor vehicle. The court further instructed the jury that ―murder of the second\ndegree is . . . the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought . . . if\n[the] perpetrator intended unlawfully to kill a human being but the evidence is\ninsufficient to prove deliberation and premeditation.‖\n     Both defendants argue that, in addition to instructing the jury on one type of\nsecond degree murder — an unlawful killing with intent to kill, but without\npremeditation and deliberation — the trial court, on its own initiative, should also\nhave instructed on a second type of second degree murder — an unlawful killing\nwith implied malice. They point out that second degree murder is a lesser offense\nnecessarily included within the crime of murder, and that a trial court‘s obligation\nto instruct on lesser included offenses includes the duty to instruct on every form\nof the lesser included offense that is supported by substantial evidence. (People\nv. Breverman (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198942\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198942/people-v-breverman/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162 [―a trial court errs if it fails to instruct,\nsua sponte, on all theories of a lesser included offense which find substantial\nsupport in the evidence‖].) Here, they argue, there was substantial evidence that\nthey unlawfully killed victims Robinson and Fuller while acting with implied\nmalice, and the trial court therefore erred by failing to instruct on this type of\nsecond degree murder.\n     We find no error. When a defendant is charged with murder and the\nprosecution proceeds on the theory that the killing was an intentional,\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\fpremeditated killing, the trial court must instruct on an implied malice theory of\nsecond degree murder only if the record contains evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude that the defendant killed without express malice,\nbut with implied malice. (People v. Bunyard (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1162542\"><a href=\"/opinion/1162542/people-v-bunyard/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1233.) Here,\nthe record contained no such evidence. The prosecution presented strong evidence\nthat both defendants acted with intent to kill, and therefore with express malice:\nThe victims were shot with armor-piercing shells fired from an assault-type rifle,\neach victim was hit multiple times (although one shot may have hit both victims),\nand each defendant made a statement after the murders that implied he had acted\nwith intent to kill. (See pt. II.B.7., ante.) Neither defendant presented evidence\nthat he acted with implied malice or any less culpable mental state; instead, each\npresented evidence tending to show that he did not participate in the murders.\n(See pt. I.A.2., ante.) Thus, the evidence showed that each defendant was guilty\nof murder with express malice or not guilty at all, and the trial court therefore had\nno duty to instruct on an implied malice theory of second degree murder.\n     Both defendants here argue that in not instructing the jury on second degree\nmurder resulting from an unlawful killing by implied malice, the trial court\nviolated their right to due process under the federal Constitution‘s Fourteenth\nAmendment by forcing the jury to make an ―all or nothing‖ choice between first\ndegree murder and acquittal.

Not so. The jury was instructed\non another form of second degree murder — second degree murder resulting from\nan unlawful killing by a perpetrator acting with intent to kill — and accordingly\ndid not have an all-or-nothing choice in evaluating defendants‘ culpability.

Refusal to give proposed defense instruction\n     Defendants argue that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury:\n―Merely being in the company of a person believed to have committed a felony is\nnot sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict.‖ We find no error. Declining defendants‘\nrequest to give this instruction, the trial court instead instructed the jury that\n―[m]ere presence at the scene of the crime which does not itself assist the\ncommission of the crime does not amount to aiding and abetting,‖ and that ―[m]ere\nknowledge . . . that a crime is being committed and a failure to prevent it does\nnot . . . amount to aiding and abetting.‖ This instruction conveyed the essence of\nthe instruction proposed by defendants.\n\n           10. Failure to give limiting instruction\n     The trial court instructed the jury: ―If you find that a defendant attempted to\nor did persuade a witness to testify falsely or attempted to or did fabricate\nevidence to be produced at the trial, that conduct may be considered by you as a\ncircumstance tending to show a consciousness of guilt. However, that conduct is\nnot sufficient by itself to prove guilt and its weight and significance, if any, are for\nyou to decide.‖ (See CALJIC No. 2.04.) It also instructed: ―If you find that an[]\neffort to procure false or fabricated evidence was made by another person for the\ndefendant‘s benefit, you may not consider that effort as tending to show[] the\ndefendant‘s consciousness of guilt unless you also find that the defendant\nauthorized that effort. If you find defendant authorized the effort, that conduct is\nnot sufficient by itself to prove guilt, and its weight and significance, if any, are\nfor you to decide.‖ (See CALJIC No. 2.05.)\n     Defendant Satele objected to both instructions. Contending that the\nprosecution had presented no evidence that he had tried to persuade a witness to\ntestify falsely or to fabricate evidence, he asked the trial court to modify CALJIC\nNo. 2.04 to state that it applied only to codefendant Nunez. The court refused.\n\n\n                                           63\n\f     Defendant Satele contends that the trial court erred by giving the two\ninstructions without the modification he requested. We disagree. The first\ninstruction merely told the jury that if it found that either defendant had tried,\nsuccessfully or unsuccessfully, to persuade a witness to testify falsely, or had tried\nto fabricate evidence to be produced at trial, such conduct could indicate\nconsciousness of guilt but was itself insufficient to prove guilt, and the jury was\n―to determine the weight and significance assigned to such behavior.‖ (People v.\nJackson (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1205550\"><a href=\"/opinion/1205550/people-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1224.) Similarly, the second instruction\nexplained that the jury could not consider a third party‘s efforts to procure false\nevidence as indicating a defendant‘s consciousness of guilt unless the jury also\nfound that the defendant had authorized that effort; it also clarified that such\nauthorization was insufficient to prove a defendant‘s guilt, but the jury was to\ndetermine the weight and significance of the evidence. These instructions told the\njury to infer that a particular defendant had a consciousness of guilt only if that\ndefendant had engaged in the described conduct. Thus, if — as defendant Satele\ncontends — the prosecution presented no evidence that he tried to procure false\ntestimony or to fabricate evidence, and no evidence that he authorized anyone else\nto do so, we presume that the jury concluded that the instructions did not apply to\nhim and it should not infer a consciousness of his guilt. (See Jackson, at p. 1225\n[― ‗[A]t worst, there was no evidence to support the instruction and . . . it was\nsuperfluous.‘ ‖].)\n\n           11. Error in allowing jury to make special circumstance findings as to\n               each count\n     Defendants contend that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to make\nmultiple-murder special-circumstance findings as to each count of murder.\n(§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3).) The Attorney General concedes the error. We agree, and\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\fvacate one multiple-murder special-circumstance finding for each defendant.\n(Hardy, supra, 2 Cal.4th at pp. 191, 216.)\n\n           12. Effect of erroneous guilt phase instructions and duplicative\n               multiple-murder special-circumstance findings on judgments of\n               death\n     Defendants assert that the duplicative multiple-murder special-circumstance\nfindings, considered in conjunction with the trial court‘s instructional errors\npertaining to the gang enhancement (see part II.B.4., ante), the firearm use\nenhancement (see part II.B.5., ante), and the multiple-murder special-circumstance\nallegations (see part II.B.7., ante), affected the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations,\nrequiring reversal of the judgment of death. We disagree. These errors had no\neffect on the admissibility of any evidence presented to the jury at either the guilt\nor the penalty phase of trial, and hence do not require reversal of the judgment of\ndeath.

Upon the\nfailure of the jury . . . to so determine, the degree of the crime or attempted crime\nof which the defendant is guilty, shall be deemed to be of the lesser degree.‖\nHere, the jury‘s signed verdict forms found defendants ―guilty of the crime of\nwillful, deliberate, premeditated murder, in violation of section 187(a) of the Penal\nCode‖ as to each charge of murder. Because each of these findings is equivalent\nto a finding of first degree murder, section 1157 is not implicated. (People v.

In any event, application of our holding in San Nicolas to this case does not\nviolate Satele‘s rights under either provision because that holding did not attach\ncriminality to a prior act that was innocent when done, impose a greater\npunishment for a crime than was prescribed at the time of its commission, or alter\nthe degree or measure of proof necessary to convict from that which was required\nat the time a crime was committed.

Claim that guilt and penalty verdicts were returned by a jury of\n               fewer than 12 sworn jurors\n     After 12 trial jurors were selected by the parties, the trial court administered\nthis statutorily required oath (Code Civ. Proc., § 232, subd. (b)): ―You, and each\nof you, do understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now\npending before this court and render a true verdict according to the evidence\npresented to you and the instructions of this court?‖ The jurors collectively\nresponded, ―I will.‖ Shortly thereafter, six alternate jurors were selected, and the\ncourt inquired: ―You understand and agree that you will act as an alternate juror\nin the case now pending before this court by listening to the evidence and\ninstructions of this court, and will act as a trial juror when called upon to do so?‖\nThe alternate jurors collectively responded, ―I will.‖ The jurors and alternate\njurors were then excused for the weekend, after which several persons, including\nJuror No. 5, spoke to the court and counsel privately.\n     The next Monday, the trial court excused Juror No. 5 for cause, and replaced\nher with an alternate. The court then read the amended information, and told the\njury: ―Members and alternate members of the jury, you have been selected and\nsworn as jurors and alternate jurors. I shall now instruct you as to your basic\nfunctions, duty and conduct. At the conclusion of the case I will give you further\ninstructions on the law. . . . You must base the decision you make on the facts and\nthe law. First, you must determine the facts from the evidence received in the trial\nand not from any other source. A ‗fact‘ is something proved by the evidence or by\nstipulation. . . . Second, you must apply the law that I state to you to the facts as\n\n\n\n\n                                          67\n\fyou determine them, and in this way arrive at your verdict and any findings you\nare instructed to include in your verdict.‖\n     During the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations, the trial court replaced Jurors\nNos. 9 and 10 with alternate jurors. At no time did the court administer to the\nthree alternate jurors who replaced Jurors Nos. 5, 9, and 10 the oath described in\nCode of Civil Procedure section 232‘s subdivision (b), which it had administered\nat the beginning of trial to the other sitting jurors.\n     Both defendants argue that the guilt and penalty verdicts were returned by a\njury of fewer than 12 sworn jurors, because the three alternates who served on the\njury were never properly sworn as they did not take the same oath given to the\njurors already selected. Defendants rely on section 1089 and Code of Civil\nProcedure section 234, each of which provides in relevant part, ―The alternate\njurors shall be seated so as to have equal power and facilities for seeing and\nhearing the proceedings in the case, and shall take the same oath as the jurors\nalready selected . . . .‖ (Italics added.)\n     We agree with defendants that the trial court erred in failing to administer the\nproper oath to the alternate jurors when they were sworn, but we conclude there\nwas no prejudice. In the presence of the prospective jurors later chosen as\nalternate jurors, the trial court administered the oath required by Code of Civil\nProcedure section 232‘s subdivision (b) to the jurors who had been selected to\ndecide the case. A short time later, the alternate jurors took an oath that each of\nthem would ―act as an alternate juror in the case now pending before this court by\nlistening to the evidence and instructions of this court, and . . . act as a trial juror\nwhen called upon to do so.‖ Because the alternates had heard the oath taken by\nthe 12 jurors selected to try the case, they were aware that to ―act as a trial juror\nwhen called upon to do so‖ meant that they must comply with the oath set forth in\nCode of Civil Procedure section 232‘s subdivision (b) — that is, to ―try the cause\n\n                                             68\n\fnow pending before this court and render a true verdict according only to the\nevidence presented to you and the instructions of this court.‖ The trial court\nemphasized these principles in the opening instructions given to both the jurors\nand the alternates, explaining that the jury must reach its verdict by determining\nthe facts from ―the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source,‖\nand by applying the law as stated by the court to those facts. The error was\ntherefore harmless. (See People v.

Penalty Phase Issues\n\n           1. Discharge of Juror No. 10\n\n                a. Factual background\n     On Thursday, June 29, 2000, during the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations,\nthe trial court received this note from the jury: ―We are at an impasse on the\nverdict 10-2, what and how do we go on? Need answer ASAP.‖ About\n35 minutes later, Juror No. 6, the foreperson, wrote the court another note saying:\n―Jury member #10 . . . stated that she had confided with her friend and mother and\nthat they sided with her doubts — Possibly replacing her would be appropriate.‖\nThe next day, the court and counsel spoke with Juror No. 6. The court read the\nnotes from the day before out loud and asked Juror No. 6, ―[W]hen did you\ndiscover that [Juror No. 10] had been talking to her mom?‖ Juror No. 6 replied,\n―She admitted [it] to us right at the table.‖\n     The trial court and counsel then questioned Juror No. 10, who said that after\nthe guilt phase deliberations she had ―confided with [her] friend and mother about\nissues relating to this case.‖ The court asked whether the discussions happened in\n\n\n                                           69\n\fthe penalty phase, and Juror No. 10 said, ―No.‖ The court asked, ―As you were\ndeliberating?‖ Juror No. 10 replied, ―No, it was after. It was the day that I turned\nit in, and it didn‘t sit right with me.‖ The court then said: ―I just want to make\nsure that because the jury‘s still what we call live and deliberating, I don‘t want\nyou to disclose anything relating to the deliberation process unless I instruct you to\ndo so.‖ The court asked if Juror No. 10 remembered when she had spoken to her\nmother and to her friend. Juror No. 10 said that the conversations occurred two\ndays earlier on Wednesday evening, and lasted about five minutes with her friend,\nand about a minute or two with her mother.\n     The court asked Juror No. 10 if she had described to her mother the vote she\nanticipated casting on the question of penalty. Juror No. 10 said she had not told\nher mother, but as to her friend, she ―would have to say yes.‖ The court asked if\nJuror No. 10 had told her friend ―what you‘re thinking about making —‖ Juror\nNo. 10 interrupted and said: ―No, no, no, no, no. We had already reached the\nverdict. Wednesday night we had reached the verdict.‖ The court said:\n―Obviously, there‘s no verdict because at this point in time there is no verdict\nreached. So you‘re still deliberating, in other words?‖ Juror No. 10 replied,\n―Yes.‖ The court said: ―You‘re still going through the process, and Thursday you\nwere going through the process as you were on Wednesday, and today you‘re\ngoing through the process, right?‖ Juror No. 10 replied, ―Yes.‖\n     Juror No. 10 said her friend had come over to see her on Wednesday night.\nShe explained: ―[The friend] saw that I was upset, and she asked me how was the\ncase going. I said oh, it‘s over with, you know. We‘re going to turn in the verdict\nin the morning, and she said okay, well, you know, that‘s really good; and I said,\nwell, you know, I guess it is. It just all depends on how you look at it; and she\nsays as long as it sits right with you, that‘s all that matters; and from there — it\nwasn‘t sitting right already when I got home.‖ Juror No. 10 did not tell her friend\n\n                                          70\n\f―what was not sitting right.‖ The friend asked what the jury had decided. When\nJuror No. 10 said she could not discuss it, the friend asked, ― ‗well did you go\n. . .,‘ ‖ and made gestures. (The record does not describe the gestures, but we infer\nfrom the testimony that she made ―thumbs up‖ and ―thumbs down‖ motions.) The\ntrial court asked Juror No. 10, ―One way or the other?‖ Juror No. 10 responded:\n―And when she went like this here (gesturing) and I just said yeah, to the one, and\nshe just said, ‗hmm, interesting,‘ ‖ and made a statement relating to views on the\ndeath penalty.\n     Also on Wednesday evening Juror No. 10 received a call from her mother.\nAt the end of the conversation, her mother asked, ― ‗So how is your case going?‘ ‖\nJuror No. 10 said, ―You know what, it‘s done,‖ and her mother said, ― ‗Well,\ngood.‘ ‖ Her mother then mentioned a political topic, and Juror No. 10 said,\n―Well . . . that has nothing to do with me . . . . I have some issues and some stuff\nthat I have to work out.‖ Her mother replied, ― ‗Well, just pray.‘ ‖ Juror No. 10\ndid not describe to her mother the ―issues‖ she had to ―work out.‖\n     The prosecutor asked the trial court to excuse Juror No. 10. Defendant\nNunez‘s counsel asked the court to determine whether the jury had reached a\nverdict on Wednesday night; he asserted that if a verdict had been reached, there\nwas no reason to excuse the juror. Defendant Satele‘s counsel also wanted to\nknow ―what was done Wednesday night,‖ and whether the court and counsel were\n―under a misguided belief that they were deliberating yesterday.‖\n     The trial court found that Juror No. 10 had committed misconduct and\ndischarged her. The court explained: ―The fact that the juror maybe believed that\nthere is a verdict, it is actually a taking of a vote. Jurors take several votes and\ncontinue deliberating. The only time that they have a verdict is when they sign the\nverdict form. The fact that they may have taken a vote, even if they‘re at an\nimpasse, [does] not mean there was a verdict. . . . [T]he only thing that she\n\n                                           71\n\fdisclosed to the jurors, as I understand from her statement, is that she said she\nconfided in her mother and a friend. . . . [T]his court finds based upon the juror‘s\ndemeanor, and also based upon the juror‘s comments, that there is misconduct on\nthe juror‘s part . . . [and] grounds for substituting an alternate.‖\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Section 1089 ―authorizes the trial court to discharge a juror at any time\nbefore or after the final submission of the case to the jury if, upon good cause, the\njuror is ‗found to be unable to perform his or her duty.‘ ‖ (People v.

Whether to remove the juror is left to the\ndiscretion of the trial court, whose decision for removal is reviewed by ―asking\nwhether the grounds for such removal appear in the record as a demonstrable\nreality.‖ (People v.

This was misconduct. (People v.

For these reasons, the trial court had good\ncause to discharge Juror No. 10.\n\n\n\n                                           72\n\f           2. Discharge of Juror No. 9\n\n               a. Factual background\n     On June 20, 2000, during the evidentiary portion of the penalty phase, Juror\nNo. 9 telephoned the trial court that she was two months pregnant, had a medical\nemergency, and was on her way to the hospital. Later that day, the court received\na note from Juror No. 9‘s physician stating that the juror was in severe pain with a\nhemorrhagic cyst of the right ovary, that she had been prescribed bed rest, and that\nshe would be unable to participate in jury duty for the next 48 to 72 hours. That\nafternoon, the court and counsel spoke with Juror No. 9‘s doctor. In the\nphysician‘s view, the juror would recover within 72 hours and could then return to\njury duty. The court then declared a recess until that time.\n     On July 3, 2000, during penalty phase deliberations, the trial court read to\ncounsel a note from Juror No. 9 that was dated July 2 (a Sunday). The note stated:\n―Your Honor, [¶] Respectfully, I am asking if I may be removed from this case. I\nfeel the high amount of stress this case created will be detrimental to the health of\nmy unborn child, as well as toward myself. Because I am considered high risk in\nthis pregnancy, I want to make sure I do everything possible to increase my\nchances of being able to carry this baby full term. [¶] I wish to thank you for your\ntime, effort, and compassion in the rendering of your decision.‖ The court asked\ncounsel whether it should inquire into the matter. The prosecutor favored an\ninquiry. Counsel for both defendants, however, objected to any inquiry into Juror\nNo. 9‘s ability to continue to serve because of her health.\n     The trial court and counsel then talked to Juror No. 9. She confirmed\nsending the note, and said she was three months pregnant. The court asked her\nwhy she considered the case as potentially detrimental to her health. Juror No. 9\nexplained that two years before the trial she had had a miscarriage when she was\nfive months pregnant, at a time when she was under a lot of stress at work. When\n\n\n                                         73\n\fthe court asked whether continued participation in deliberations would cause her\nstress, Juror No. 9 replied, ―Yes, sir.‖ To the court‘s inquiry whether it had\n―caused a great amount of stress,‖ Juror No. 9 replied, ―Yes, especially Friday.‖\nThe court asked, ―Do you believe that it would be in your best interests and the\nbest interests of your unborn child if you are excused from this case?‖ Juror No. 9\nsaid, ―Yes, sir.‖ The court asked: ―Based on your . . . health and your health\nhistory — would it . . . be your opinion that you would be unable to discharge and\nperform your duty any further in this case and continue deliberating?‖ Juror No. 9\nreplied, ―Yes, sir.‖\n     Defendant Nunez‘s counsel asked Juror No. 9, ―What happened on Friday?‖\nShe replied, ―Friday is when I began to feel the pains that I have felt in the past.‖\nNunez‘s counsel asked Juror No. 9 if she had ―seen a doctor since Friday?‖ She\nsaid: ―I was trying to get in to see a doctor Friday afternoon and was unable to. So\nif I can today, I‘m going to try to get in to see a doctor.‖\n     After hearing argument, the court ruled: ―The court finds good cause to\nexcuse Juror No. 9. . . . [T]his court finds that this juror‘s unable to perform her\nduty; and given that she . . . two years ago lost a child at five months because of\nstress at work, and given the stress that this case has caused upon her throughout\nthis trial — she has suffered one hemorrhage, and now she is having pains again\nstarting Friday — to ask her to continue on to endanger her life and also the life of\nher unborn child, if that is the ultimate risk . . . would be a high price to pay for\njury duty. . . . [T]he court finds good cause that this juror is unable to perform the\njuror‘s duty because she‘s sick.‖ It then discharged Juror No. 9.\n\n                b. Analysis\n     Defendants fault the trial court for discharging Juror No. 9 for cause. We\nperceive no error.\n\n\n\n                                           74\n\f     As noted above in part II.C.1.b., section 1089 ―authorizes the trial court to\ndischarge a juror at any time before or after the final submission of the case to the\njury if, upon good cause, the juror is ‗found to be unable to perform his or her\nduty.‘ ‖ (Bennett, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 621.) ―Removal of a juror under section\n1089 is committed to the discretion of the trial court, and we review such\ndecisions by asking whether the grounds for such removal appear in the record as\na demonstrable reality.‖ (Thompson, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 137.) Defendants\ncontend the record here shows no such demonstrable reality because Juror No. 9\ndid not persist in her efforts to see a doctor about her condition, and because the\ntrial court did not speak to Juror No. 9‘s doctor about the pain she was feeling.\nThey note that previously, when Juror No. 9 was forced to temporarily suspend\nher jury service because of severe pain, her doctor had attributed the pain to a cyst,\nnot stress, and had told the court that Juror No. 9 could resume jury service after\nthree days of rest.\n     Juror No. 9 had a high-risk pregnancy and was experiencing pain, and earlier\nin the penalty phase she had experienced hemorrhaging that caused her doctor to\norder her to go on bed rest and suspend her jury service for three days. She felt\nstress from the jury deliberations, and a previous pregnancy had ended in a\nmiscarriage that occurred when she was under stress. Based on these\ncircumstances, the trial court had ample reason to discharge Juror No. 9.

Failure to instruct jury to begin deliberations anew\n\n                a. Factual background\n     When the trial court first learned that Juror No. 9 was ill and might be unable\nto return to jury service, it told the parties it was considering instructing the jury\nwith CALJIC No. 17.51, which directs the jury, following the replacement of a\njuror with an alternate during deliberations, to ―set aside and disregard all past\ndeliberations and begin deliberating anew.‖ But when the court replaced Juror No.\n10 with Alternate Juror No. 2, it instead instructed the jury, without objection,\nsolely in the language of CALJIC No. 17.51.1: ―Members of the jury, a juror has\nbeen replaced by an alternate juror. The alternate juror was present during the\npresentation of all the evidence, arguments of counsel, and reading of instructions\nduring the guilt phase of the trial. However, the alternate juror did not participate\nin the jury deliberations which resulted in the verdicts and findings returned by\nyou to this point. For the purposes of this penalty phase of the trial, the alternate\njuror must accept as having been proved beyond a reasonable doubt those guilty\nverdicts and true findings rendered by the jury in the guilt phase of this trial. Your\nfunction now is to determine along with the other jurors, in the light of the prior\nverdict or verdicts and findings and the evidence and law, what penalty should be\nimposed. Each of you must participate fully in the deliberations, including any\nreview as may be necessary of the evidence presented in the guilt phase of the\ntrial.‖ The court did not give CALJIC No. 17.51.\n     When the trial court later replaced Juror No. 9 with Alternate Juror No. 4, it\nagain gave CALJIC No. 17.51.1, but not CALJIC No. 17.51. As before, there was\nno objection. The record contains no explanation for the court‘s failure to give\nCALJIC No. 17.51.\n     After Juror No. 9 was replaced, the jury deliberated for about 50 minutes\nbefore reaching a verdict of death as to both defendants.\n\n\n                                           76\n\f                b. Analysis\n     Defendants contend that after replacing Jurors Nos. 9 and 10, the trial court\nerred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard its previous penalty deliberations\nand to begin deliberating anew. (See CALJIC No. 17.51.) They rely on Collins,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251210/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n     In Collins, which was not a death penalty case, we held that ―substitution of\nan alternate for an original juror is constitutionally permissible after deliberations\nhave begun‖ when ―good cause has been shown and the jury has been instructed to\nbegin deliberations anew.‖ (Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 691.) We observed:\n―The requirement that 12 persons reach a unanimous verdict is not met unless\nthose 12 reach their consensus through deliberations which are the common\nexperience of all of them. It is not enough that 12 jurors reach a unanimous\nverdict if 1 juror has not had the benefit of the deliberations of the other 11.\nDeliberations provide the jury with the opportunity to review the evidence in light\nof the perception and memory of each member. Equally important in shaping a\nmember‘s viewpoint are the personal reactions and interactions as any individual\njuror attempts to persuade others to accept his or her viewpoint. The result is a\nbalance easily upset if a new juror enters the decision-making process after the 11\nothers have commenced deliberations. The elements of number and unanimity\ncombine to form an essential element of unity in the verdict. By this we mean that\na defendant may not be convicted except by 12 jurors who have heard all the\nevidence and argument and who together have deliberated to unanimity.‖ (Id. at\np. 693.) We therefore construed section 1089, which authorizes trial courts to\nreplace a sitting juror with an alternate, as requiring any court making such a\nreplacement to ―instruct the jury to set aside and disregard all past deliberations\nand begin deliberating anew.‖ (Collins, at p. 694.) But we held that the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                          77\n\fcourt‘s erroneous failure to give such an instruction in Collins was harmless under\nstate law. (Id. at p. 697.)\n     In People v. Fields (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1259622\"><a href=\"/opinion/1259622/people-v-fields/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fields), a capital case, the\ndefendant argued that the trial court violated his right to a jury that was a\nrepresentative cross-section of the community at the guilt phase of trial by\nexcusing for cause prospective jurors whose views about the death penalty made\nthem unable to sit as jurors at the penalty phase. In explaining why his claim\nlacked merit, we discussed why such jurors could not routinely be allowed to serve\non the jury during the guilt phase, and replaced with alternates for the penalty\nphase. (Id. at p. 351, fn. 9.) We observed: ―[A]n alternate joining the jury after it\nhad deliberated on the issues of guilt and special circumstances and reached a\nverdict . . . would be joining a group which has already discussed and evaluated\nthe circumstances of the crime, the capacity of the defendant, and other issues\nwhich bear both on guilt and on penalty. The resulting deliberations between old\nmembers who have already considered the evidence and may have arrived at\ntentative conclusions on some aspects of the case, and new members ignorant of\nthose discussions and conclusions, would depart from the requirement that jurors\n‗reach their consensus through deliberations which are the common experience of\nall of them‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 351, quoting Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 693.)\n     Despite this language in Fields, supra, 35 Cal.3d at page 351, we have\nrepeatedly held that a trial court need not give an instruction based on Collins,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251210/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, when an alternate juror is substituted at the penalty phase\nbefore deliberations begin. (See, e.g., People v. Ashmus (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386274\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386274/people-v-ashmus/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1005.) But here, the jury‘s penalty phase deliberations had already begun when\nJuror Nos. 9 and 10 were discharged; hence the instruction was required. (See\nLedesma, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 743 [discharge of juror after penalty deliberations\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\fhad begun did not require discharge of the entire jury because the court instructed\nthe jury to disregard their past deliberations and begin deliberations anew].)\n     We therefore consider whether the trial court‘s error in not instructing the\njury to set aside its previous deliberations and begin anew was prejudicial. Both\ndefendants contend this error violated their rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. In Collins, supra, 17 Cal.3d\nat page 697, footnote 5, we held that such an error does not violate the federal\nConstitution when it occurs at the guilt phase; here defendants offer no persuasive\nargument why the result should be different when the error occurs at the penalty\nphase. Therefore, our prejudice assessment applies the test for state law error at\nthe penalty phase of trial: Is there a ―reasonable possibility‖ that the error affected\nthe jury‘s penalty verdict? (People v.

Each of you must\nparticipate fully in the deliberations, including any review as may be necessary of\nthe evidence presented in the guilt phase of the trial.‖ Although this instruction\ndid not expressly state that deliberations were to begin anew, its comment that\neach juror must ―participate fully in the deliberations‖ implied that this was the\ncase. (See People v. Cain (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1163416\"><a href=\"/opinion/1163416/people-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 [such language did not ―suggest\nthe substituted juror should play less than an equal role‖ in reviewing the guilt\nphase evidence to assess the circumstances of the crime and the existence of\nlingering doubt].)\n     Furthermore, the Collins instruction plays a more limited role at the penalty\nphase of trial than at the guilt phase. ―Unlike the guilt determination, ‗the\nsentencing function is inherently moral and normative, not factual.‘ ‖ (People\nv. Hawthorne (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236812\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236812/people-v-hawthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79.) Thus, a penalty phase juror properly\n\n                                          79\n\fconsiders ―personal religious, philosophical, or secular normative values‖ in\nmaking a penalty determination. (Danks, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 311; People v.\nLewis (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389-390 [jurors may rely ― ‗on their personal faith\nand deeply-held beliefs when facing the awesome decision of whether to impose\nthe sentence of death on a fellow citizen‘ ‖].) The standard penalty phase\ninstructions emphasize the personal nature of the penalty decision. Jurors are\ninstructed, as they were in this case, that each juror is ―free to assign [whatever]\nmoral or sympathetic value‖ that juror deems ―appropriate to each and all of the\nvarious factors‖ in aggravation and mitigation. (See CALJIC No. 8.88.) The\njurors in this case were also instructed that they could ―decide not to impose the\npenalty of death by granting the defendant mercy, regardless of whether or not [the\ndefendant] deserves . . . sympathy.‖\n     Although a juror‘s view regarding the weight of a particular aggravating or\nmitigating factor, or the extension of mercy, may be informed by discussion with\nother jurors, ultimately it is a profoundly personal decision qualitatively different\nfrom the fact finding required by the jury in determining guilt for the charged\noffenses, which was the situation we confronted in Collins, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251210/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nMoreover, unlike at the guilt phase, although a juror may be required to find some\nfacts at the penalty phase, a juror can consider an aggravating factor even if other\njurors do not agree it has been proven.\n     For these reasons — the language of the instruction given, and the normative\ncontext of the penalty phase deliberations — we conclude there was no reasonable\npossibility that the outcome of the penalty phase was affected by the trial court‘s\nfailure to instruct the jury to set aside its prior deliberations when it replaced\nJurors Nos. 9 and 10 with alternate jurors.\n\n\n\n\n                                           80\n\f           4. Constitutionality of the death penalty statute\n     Both defendants contend that the California death penalty law is\nunconstitutional, asserting various claims we have repeatedly rejected in the past.\n     Thus, we have said that ―the California death penalty statute is not\nimpermissibly broad, whether considered on its face or as interpreted by this\ncourt.‖ (People v. Dykes (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813 (Dykes).) We have further\n―reject[ed] the claim that section 190.3, factor (a), on its face or as interpreted and\napplied, permits arbitrary and capricious imposition of a sentence of death.‖\n(Ibid.; see Tuilaepa v.
