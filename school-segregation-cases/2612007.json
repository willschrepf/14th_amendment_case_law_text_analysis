Acts   1697      (“the    2005    Act”).         That    Act     amended    South\n\nCarolina’s    retirement        laws    by    requiring       public    employees    who\n\nretire and then return to work to make, beginning on July 1,\n\n2005, the same contributions to state-created pension plans as\n\npre-retirement employees but without receiving further pension\n\nbenefits.     The plaintiffs claimed that the 2005 Act effected a\n\ntaking of their private property, in violation of the Takings\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth    Amendment.          They       named    as     defendants    two    state-\n\ncreated pension plans, in which they are participants; the South\n\nCarolina    Retirement     Systems       Group       Trust    (“the    Trust”),    which\n\nholds the pension plans’ assets; and state officials serving as\n\ntrustees and administrators of the pension plans.                         For relief,\n\nthey    sought     repayment      of    all      contributions         withheld    since\n\nJuly 1,    2005,     and   injunctive         relief       prohibiting     the    future\n\ncollection of such contributions.\n\n       Pursuant    to   the     defendants’       motion,       the    district    court\n\ndismissed the complaint on the ground that all of the defendants\n\nare entitled to sovereign immunity.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       We affirm, albeit on reasoning slightly different from that\n\ngiven by the district court.                      We conclude, as did the district\n\ncourt, that the pension plans and the Trust are arms of the\n\nState of South Carolina and therefore have sovereign immunity.\n\nLikewise, we conclude that the state officials sued in their\n\nofficial capacities for repayment of pension-plan contributions\n\nhave sovereign immunity.                    Finally, we conclude that the state\n\nofficials       sued      in    their       official       capacities        for     prospective\n\ninjunctive relief have sovereign immunity because their duties\n\nbear    no    relation         to    the    collection        of     the    public   employees’\n\ncontributions to the pension plans, precluding application of Ex\n\nparte      Young,      209          U.S.    123        (1908).         In     reaching       these\n\nconclusions,         we    reject          the    plaintiffs’         argument       that    their\n\nclaims       under   the       Takings       Clause      of    the    Fifth    Amendment       are\n\nexempt from the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n                                                   I\n\n       The plaintiffs are public employees and participants in two\n\npension plans created by South Carolina in 1962 -- the South\n\nCarolina       Retirement            System       and    the       South     Carolina       Police\n\nOfficers       Retirement            System       (collectively,             “the     Retirement\n\nSystem”). 1      See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 9-1-20, 9-11-20(1).                              In their\n\n\n       1\n       In all, South Carolina has created five pension plans for\npublic employees, each referred to as a “Retirement System” --\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fcomplaint, they alleged that they and others similarly situated\n\nare “retired contributing members” of the Retirement System, who\n\nreturned to work on or after July 1, 2005, when the 2005 Act\n\nwent   into     effect,    and    who    are,     by    reason    of   the     2005 Act,\n\nrequired “to contribute a portion of their gross earnings” to\n\nthe Retirement System “without receiving any additional service\n\ncredit    or    interest     on   their        retirement       accounts.”          Before\n\nJuly 1, 2005, retired participants could return to work for a\n\nsalary of up to $50,000 without forfeiting the right to receive\n\nretirement      benefits        and     without        having    to    make         further\n\ncontributions to the Retirement System.                     See Ahrens v. State,\n\n709 S.E.2d 54, 56-57 (S.C. 2011).                      But this changed with the\n\nenactment of the 2005 Act, and retired participants who return\n\nto work are now required to make the same contributions to the\n\nRetirement      System     as     pre-retirement          employees      but        without\n\naccruing additional service credit for pension benefits.                               See\n\nS.C.     Code   Ann.      §§ 9-1-1790(C),         9-11-90(4)(c).              The    South\n\nCarolina    General      Assembly       made    the    change    to    help    fund     the\n\n\n\n\nthe South Carolina Retirement System, the Retirement System for\nJudges and Solicitors of the State of South Carolina, the\nRetirement System for members of the General Assembly of the\nState of South Carolina, the National Guard Retirement System,\nand the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System. S.C.\nCode Ann. §§ 9-1-20, 9-8-20, 9-9-20, 9-10-20(A), 9-11-20(1).\n\n\n                                           5\n\fRetirement System and, in particular, to secure future cost-of-\n\nliving adjustments.\n\n     The plaintiffs commenced this class action in August 2010\n\non behalf of themselves and all other participating employees\n\nwho returned to work on or after July 1, 2005, alleging that, by\n\nenforcing     the    2005 Act,        the       defendants       “confiscated        their\n\nprivate property,” in violation of the Takings Clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment and their procedural due process rights under\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.             In addition to naming as defendants\n\nthe two pension plans, the plaintiffs named the Trust, which\n\nholds the assets of the Retirement System, and a number of state\n\nofficials    in     their     official      capacities       who,     as      members    or\n\nexecutive directors of the State Budget and Control Board and\n\nthe Public Employee Benefit Authority, serve as trustees and\n\nadministrators of the Retirement System.                       The State Budget and\n\nControl Board and the Public Employee Benefit Authority are the\n\nstatutorily    designated         co-trustees         of   the   Retirement      System.\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 9-1-1310(A).\n\n     For     relief,        the   plaintiffs          sought     (1) a        declaratory\n\njudgment     that     the     2005     Act       is    unconstitutional;             (2) an\n\ninjunction    against       its   enforcement;         (3) an    accounting       of    all\n\ncontributions they made to the Retirement System since July 1,\n\n2005;   (4) an      injunction       compelling        the   return      of    all     such\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fcontributions; and (5) an order awarding them attorneys fees and\n\ncosts. 2\n\n     The Retirement System, the Trust, and the state officials\n\nfiled    a      motion   to   dismiss   the    complaint   pursuant    to    Federal\n\nRules      of    Civil    Procedure     12(b)(1),   12(b)(3),    and       12(b)(6),\n\nasserting numerous grounds for their motion, including sovereign\n\nimmunity, claim and issue preclusion based on the prior state\n\nlitigation,        discretionary      abstention,    and   failure    to    state   a\n\nclaim upon which relief can be granted.                     The district court\n\ngranted the motion and dismissed the complaint, relying only on\n\nthe defendants’ sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n     2\n       Before this action was commenced, public employees who\nretired and then returned to work before July 1, 2005, also\ncommenced an action in state court, alleging that the 2005 Act\nbreached a legislatively created contract with the “old working\nretirees” and violated the Takings Clause and the Due Process\nClause of the U.S. Constitution.     The South Carolina Supreme\nCourt rejected the argument, holding that the “old working\nretiree statute [did] not create a binding contract between the\nState and the old working retirees,” but the court did remand\nthe case to the trial court “for a case by case factual\ndetermination of whether any actions of the State with regard to\nindividual old working retirees constituted a breach of\ncontract.” Layman v. State, 630 S.E.2d 265, 271-72 (S.C. 2006).\nIn 2011, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the circuit\ncourt’s conclusion that forms signed by the old working\nretirees, stating that they would not be required to pay into\nthe pension plans, did not create a contract between the State\nand the old working retirees.      Ahrens, 709 S.E.2d at 58-60.\nBecause the employees’ claims under the Takings Clause and the\nDue Process Clause were “founded on the presumption that a\ncontractual right ha[d] been unfairly taken away,” the court\nalso affirmed the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment on\nthose claims. Id. at 63.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fWith     respect      to    the      institutional           defendants,        the   court\n\ndetermined that “the Retirement Systems should be considered an\n\narm of the State such that Eleventh Amendment immunity applies\n\nto bar [a federal] court from hearing the claim.”                          Hutto v. S.C.\n\nRet.     Sys.,    899 F. Supp.         2d   457,       473       (D.S.C.   2012).         And\n\n“[b]ecause Plaintiffs seek monetary damages,” it held that the\n\nclaims against the individual defendants were similarly barred.\n\nId. at 475 n.14.           Having found that all of the defendants were\n\nimmune by reason of sovereign immunity, the court declined to\n\naddress the defendants’ remaining grounds for seeking dismissal\n\nof the action.\n\n       The   plaintiffs      filed     a    motion         for    reconsideration     under\n\nRule 59(e),        asserting      that      the       district        court      erred     in\n\ndismissing       their      claims      for       a    declaratory         judgment       and\n\ninjunctive relief against the state officials serving in their\n\nofficial capacities.            They relied on Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\n\n123 (1908), which created an exception to Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity       with   respect     to    claims        for        prospective    injunctive\n\nrelief    to     remedy    ongoing      violations           of     federal    law.       The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion because, “in seeking to bar the\n\nenforcement of [the 2005 Act], which requires Plaintiffs to pay\n\ninto   the     Retirement      System,      Plaintiffs’            requested     relief    is\n\nundeniably       monetary”     and     because        an    injunction        ordering    the\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\freturn of the contributions already withheld “would ultimately\n\nimpact the State treasury.”\n\n       This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment shields a state entity from suit in\n\nfederal court “if, in [the entity’s] operations, the state is\n\nthe real party in interest,” in the sense that the “named party\n\n[is]   the   alter   ego   of    the   state.”        Ram    Ditta   v.   Md.   Nat’l\n\nCapital Park & Planning Comm’n, 822 F.2d 456, 457 (4th Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that the Retirement System and the\n\nTrust do not have the sovereign immunity afforded a State under\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment because they are “non-state entit[ies]”\n\nand that the district court’s contrary conclusion was based on\n\nan erroneous application of the factors articulated in Ram Ditta\n\nfor determining whether an entity is an alter ego of the State.\n\nThey argue, “[T]he District Court should have given effect to\n\nthe    express,      unambiguous       language        of     [South      Carolina’s\n\nretirement laws] and concluded that the Retirement Systems are\n\nindependent    corporate        entities       for   which   the     State   has   no\n\nfinancial obligation as indemnitor.”\n\n       The defendants contend that “State law makes the financial\n\nobligations of the state Retirement Systems obligations of the\n\nState”; that the State controls the Retirement System; that the\n\n                                           9\n\fpension plans of the Retirement System “operate on a statewide\n\nbasis and have statewide concerns”; and that South Carolina law\n\ntreats the pension plans as state agencies.              The defendants thus\n\nmaintain that the Retirement System and the Trust are “arms of\n\nthe State and [therefore] immune from suit.”\n\n       Whether an action is barred by the Eleventh Amendment is a\n\nquestion of law that we review de novo.            Cash v. Granville Cnty.\n\nBd. of Educ., 242 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir. 2001).\n\n       At the outset, we address which party has the burden of\n\nproof when sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is\n\nraised.       While    the   Supreme     Court   has   described   sovereign\n\nimmunity as a “jurisdictional bar” that can be raised for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517\n\nU.S.   44,    73   (1996),   and   “a   constitutional   limitation   on   the\n\nfederal judicial power established in Art. III,” Pennhurst State\n\nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98 (1984), it “ha[s] not\n\ndecided” whether Eleventh Amendment immunity goes to a court’s\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, Wis. Dep’t of Corr. v. Schacht, 524\n\nU.S. 381, 391 (1998).        Unlike subject-matter jurisdiction, which\n\ncannot be waived, a State can always waive its immunity and\n\nconsent to be sued in federal court, Atascadero State Hosp. v.\n\nScanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238 (1985), and a court need not raise\n\nthe issue on its own initiative, Wis. Dep’t of Corr., 524 U.S.\n\nat 389.      Because a defendant otherwise protected by the Eleventh\n\n                                        10\n\fAmendment       can    waive    its       protection,            it   is,    as     a   practical\n\nmatter,      structurally          necessary         to    require         the     defendant     to\n\nassert    the    immunity.           We    therefore         conclude            that   sovereign\n\nimmunity is akin to an affirmative defense, which the defendant\n\nbears the burden of demonstrating.                          In so concluding, we join\n\nevery other court of appeals that has addressed the issue.                                      See\n\nWoods v. Rondout Valley Cent. Sch. Dist.

Thus, “if the State treasury will be called upon\n\nto pay a judgment against a governmental entity, then Eleventh\n\n                                                11\n\fAmendment    immunity     applies    to    that      entity.”       Cash,      242    F.3d\n\nat 223.     If, on the other hand, the State treasury will not be\n\nliable for a judgment, sovereign immunity applies only where the\n\n“governmental entity is so connected to the State that the legal\n\naction    against   the    entity    would,         despite   the   fact       that   the\n\njudgment will not be paid from the State treasury, amount to\n\n‘the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of\n\njudicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.’”                               Id.\n\nat 224 (quoting Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 58).

S.C. Code Ann. §§ 9-\n\n1-1690, 9-11-280.\n\n      This    statutory     language,       however,         must   be   read    in   the\n\ncontext      of   Article     X,     Section 16         of    the    South      Carolina\n\nConstitution, which provides that “[t]he General Assembly shall\n\nannually     appropriate     funds    and       prescribe     member     contributions\n\nfor any state-operated retirement system which will insure the\n\navailability of funds to meet all normal and accrued liability\n\nof the system on a sound actuarial basis as determined by the\n\ngoverning     body   of     the    system.”         S.C.      Const.     art. X,      § 16\n\n(emphasis added).         Any possible ambiguity resulting from reading\n\n                                           13\n\fthe    retirement        laws    in    the     context       of    the    South    Carolina\n\nConstitution was put to rest by the South Carolina Supreme Court\n\nin Wehle v. South Carolina Retirement System, 611 S.E.2d 240,\n\n242-43 (S.C. 2005) (per curiam), where the Court stated that,\n\n“should the Board determine that any retirement system is not\n\nfunded on a sound actuarial basis, the General Assembly must\n\nprovide funding necessary to restore the fiscal integrity of the\n\nSystem.”        Thus, in the event that a judgment in this case were\n\nto render the Retirement System unable to meet its liabilities,\n\nthe    General        Assembly   would       be     obligated     to     account    for   any\n\ndeficiency by increasing appropriations to the Retirement System\n\nor    by    requiring        employers,      including       the       State    itself,    to\n\nincrease their contributions.\n\n       In addition, the State’s ultimate responsibility for the\n\nfinancial soundness of the Retirement System is reflected by the\n\nfact that the Retirement System’s “actuarial valuation is relied\n\nupon       in   the     preparation       of      the   State’s        annual      financial\n\nstatement        and    by   outside     entities       in    rating      the     State   for\n\npurposes        of    issuance   of    bonds.”          Wehle,     611    S.E.2d     at 242.\n\nThus, if a judgment in this case were to render the Retirement\n\nSystem or the Trust insolvent, that insolvency would harm the\n\nState’s credit rating, making it more expensive for the State to\n\nborrow money.\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f      Consequently,       we    conclude        that     South      Carolina     remains\n\nfunctionally     liable      for    any    judgment      against      the   Retirement\n\nSystem and the Trust, which is sufficient to make the Retirement\n\nSystem and the Trust arms of the State.                        See Oberg, 745 F.3d\n\nat 137.\n\n      We    reject     the     plaintiffs’        various        arguments       to   the\n\ncontrary.    First, they insist that Article X, Section 16 of the\n\nSouth Carolina Constitution “merely compels the State to comply\n\nwith its funding obligations as an employer,” a requirement that\n\nthe    General     Assembly        could    not     have       imposed      on    future\n\nlegislatures by legislative act.                  And they complain that “the\n\nDistrict Court unnecessarily construed the state Constitution in\n\na manner that rendered it irreconcilable with Sections 9-1-1690\n\nand 9-11-280.”       But the South Carolina Supreme Court, which, of\n\ncourse,     has the last word on the meaning of the South Carolina\n\nConstitution, rejected the plaintiffs’ posited construction of\n\nArticle X,     Section 16.           See    Wehle,       611       S.E.2d   at 242-43.\n\nMoreover,    the     plaintiffs’      argument         that   we    must    construe    a\n\nconstitutional provision so as not to conflict with a statute\n\nturns the concept of constitutional supremacy on its head.\n\n      Second, the plaintiffs maintain that there is no evidence\n\nthat a judgment in their favor would in fact create a shortfall\n\nin    the   Retirement       System’s      funds.         Yet,      given    that     the\n\nplaintiffs’ complaint alleges that “the members of the proposed\n\n                                           15\n\fclass will exceed tens of thousands of persons,” it is surely\n\nplausible that a favorable judgment could create an actuarial\n\ndeficit.     More     importantly,         whether        or    not    a   judgment        would\n\nrender the Retirement System insolvent is of little consequence\n\nto the analysis.           As the Supreme Court held in Regents of the\n\nUniversity of California v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425 (1997), “it is the\n\nentity’s potential legal liability . . . that is relevant.”                                  Id.\n\nat 431 (emphasis added); see also Owens v. Balt. City State’s\n\nAtt’ys    Office,    767       F.3d     379,    412   (4th      Cir.     2014)    (“When      an\n\nentity has both state and local characteristics, ‘the entity’s\n\npotential legal liability’ is relevant to the Eleventh Amendment\n\ninquiry” (emphasis added) (quoting Regents, 519 U.S. at 431));\n\nOberg, 745 F.3d at 137 (“[I]n assessing [the State treasury]\n\nfactor,     an     entity’s       ‘potential          legal      liability’           is    key”\n\n(emphasis        added)     (quoting           Regents,        519     U.S.      at        431)).\n\nConsequently,       “the       proper    inquiry      is       not    whether    the       state\n\ntreasury     would        be     liable        in     this       case,     but        whether,\n\nhypothetically speaking, the state treasury would be subject to\n\n‘potential legal liability’ if the retirement system did not\n\nhave the money to cover the judgment.”                           Ernst v. Rising, 427\n\nF.3d 351, 362 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Regents, 519 U.S. at\n\n431)); see also Pub. Sch. Ret. Sys. v. State St. Bank & Trust\n\nCo., 640 F.3d 821, 830 (8th Cir. 2011) (similar).                               Here, as in\n\nErnst, the “plaintiffs fail to come to grips with the fiscal\n\n                                               16\n\freality    that    the    State’s   funding   requirement       assuredly   could\n\nincrease if the retirement system were to use its current and\n\nfuture funding to pay off a judgment against it.”                        427 F.3d\n\nat 362 (emphasis added).\n\n     Third,     the    plaintiffs    read   much   into   the    fact    that   the\n\nfunds and assets of the Retirement System “are not funds of the\n\nState,” S.C. Code Ann. § 9-1-1310(C), but instead are held “in a\n\ngroup   trust     under    Section 401(a)(24)      of   the   Internal    Revenue\n\nCode,” id. § 9-16-20(C).             Section 401(a)(24) of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code requires that group trust funds not be “used for,\n\nor diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit\n\nof . . .    employees or their beneficiaries in order to qualify\n\nas a group trust.”            26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(24).            While we have\n\nrecognized that holding funds in a segregated account apart from\n\ngeneral state funds does “counsel[] against establishing arm-of-\n\nthe-state status,” Oberg, 745 F.3d at 139, that fact is not\n\ndispositive.       The plaintiffs also argue that South Carolina is\n\nviolating § 401(a)(24) by diverting the contributions they made\n\nto the Retirement System to benefit pre-retirement employees.\n\nBut even if South Carolina were indeed in violation of federal\n\nlaw by using funds contrary to § 401(a)(24), that fact would be\n\nirrelevant to whether a judgment against the Retirement System\n\nor   the   Trust      could   potentially     affect    the     State   treasury.\n\nAccord Ernst, 427 F.3d at 365.\n\n                                       17\n\f       Fourth, the plaintiffs argue that courts generally, and the\n\ndistrict court in particular, should wait until the completion\n\nof    discovery       and   the      development        of    a   factual      record       before\n\nresolving       the    sovereign         immunity       issue.       But       we    have     often\n\naffirmed       Rule 12(b)(6)            motions    to     dismiss         on   the     basis    of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.                  See, e.g., Antrican v. Odom, 290\n\nF.3d 178, 191 (4th Cir. 2002).                     In Gray v. Laws, 51 F.3d 426,\n\n434 (4th Cir. 1995), upon which the plaintiffs rely for their\n\nargument, we vacated the district court’s dismissal under the\n\nEleventh       Amendment       not      because    the       district      court      failed     to\n\nconduct sufficient factfinding, but rather because the Supreme\n\nCourt    had    changed       the     applicable        Eleventh      Amendment         standard\n\nwhile the appeal was pending and “the barrenness of the record”\n\nrendered us ill-suited to apply the new standard.\n\n       Finally, the plaintiffs contend that we are bound by our\n\nearlier decision in Almond v. Boyles, 792 F.2d 451 (4th Cir.\n\n1986).     In Almond, we rejected, “for the reasons stated by the\n\ndistrict court,” a claim that the Eleventh Amendment barred a\n\nsuit by a class of visually handicapped operators of vending\n\nstands to recover employer contributions to the North Carolina\n\nTeachers’      and     State      Employees’       Retirement        System,         which     they\n\nclaimed were collected in violation of federal law.                                 Id. at 456.\n\nThe    district       court       had    found     that       a   judgment          against    the\n\nretirement      system      would       not   come      from      State    funds      for     three\n\n                                              18\n\freasons,        the      “most       important[]”       of    which      was   that     “the\n\ndefendants [had] not shown the court that the relief requested\n\nby     the     plaintiffs        would    inevitably         lead   to    an     additional\n\nappropriation of state funds.”                      Almond v. Boyles, 612 F. Supp.\n\n223,     228    (E.D.N.C.         1985)    (emphasis         added).       But      Almond’s\n\nrequirement        that    the       defendants      show    that   a    judgment     “would\n\ninevitably” be satisfied by the State is fundamentally at odds\n\nwith Regents’ subsequent less demanding standard of potential\n\nliability,         and    therefore       Almond’s          framework     is   no     longer\n\napplicable.\n\n       As    the      Supreme    Court    has       framed    the   Eleventh      Amendment\n\ninquiry, the question is whether, “[i]f the expenditures of the\n\nenterprise exceed receipts, is the State in fact obligated to\n\nbear and pay the resulting indebtedness of the enterprise?                              When\n\nthe answer is ‘No’ -- both legally and practically -- then the\n\nEleventh Amendment’s core concern is not implicated.”                               Hess v.\n\nPort Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 51 (1994) (emphasis\n\nadded).         In     light     of    Wehle’s       interpretation      of    Article   X,\n\nSection 16, the answer to that question here is undoubtedly yes,\n\nand we therefore conclude that a judgment against the Retirement\n\nSystem and the Trust would implicate South Carolina’s treasury.\n\n                                                B\n\n       In      addition         to     South        Carolina’s      potential        funding\n\nobligation, we also conclude that state-dignity factors weigh in\n\n                                               19\n\ffavor of finding that the Retirement System and the Trust are\n\narms of the State.            See Fed. Maritime Comm’n, 535 U.S. at 765.\n\nWhen   assessing    whether      allowing    suit    against     a   state      entity\n\nwould offend a State’s dignity, we consider “(1) the degree of\n\ncontrol that the State exercises over the entity or the degree\n\nof autonomy from the State that the entity enjoys; (2) the scope\n\nof the entity’s concerns -- whether local or statewide -- with\n\nwhich the entity is involved; and (3) the manner in which State\n\nlaw treats the entity.”          Cash, 242 F.3d at 224.\n\n       Under the degree-of-state-control factor, we consider “who\n\nappoints    the    entity’s      directors   or     officers,     who     funds      the\n\nentity, and whether the State retains a veto over the entity’s\n\nactions,” Oberg, 745 F.3d at 137 (quoting U.S. ex rel. Oberg v.\n\nKy. Higher Educ. Student Loan Corp., 681 F.3d 575, 580 (4th Cir.\n\n2012)) (internal quotation marks omitted), as well as “whether\n\nan entity has the ability to contract, sue and be sued, and\n\npurchase and sell property, and whether it is represented in\n\nlegal matters by the state attorney general,” id. (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n       In this case, the Retirement System does have the “power\n\nand privileges of a corporation,” S.C. Code. Ann. §§ 9-1-20, 9-\n\n11-20,   including      the    powers   to   “sue   and     be   sued,”    to    “make\n\ncontracts,” and to buy and sell property, id. § 33-3-102.                         But,\n\ncontrary    to    the   plaintiffs’     argument,     the    designation        of    an\n\n                                        20\n\fentity as a corporation with the power to sue and be sued is not\n\nconclusive in establishing its autonomy.               See Oberg, 745 F.3d\n\nat 139 (finding that the autonomy factor “cut both ways,” even\n\nthough the entity had the “power to enter into contracts, sue\n\nand be sued, and purchase and sell property in its own name”);\n\nsee also State Highway Comm’n v. Utah Const. Co., 278 U.S. 194,\n\n199 (1929) (“It is unnecessary for us to consider the effect of\n\nthe general grant of power to sue or be sued . . . -- this suit,\n\nin effect, is against the state and must be so treated”).\n\n     And other factors point to state control.                  The means by\n\nwhich   the   entities’     officers   are    appointed    suggest    that   the\n\nRetirement System is beholden to the State.                The State Budget\n\nand Control Board and the Public Employee Benefit Authority,\n\nwhich   are   the   co-trustees   of   the    Retirement    System,    and   the\n\nRetirement    System   Investment      Commission,     which    has   exclusive\n\nauthority to invest the Trust’s assets, see S.C.

Although several of the appointees are required to\n\nbe participants in the Retirement System, even those members are\n\n                                       21\n\fselected          by     state        officials.              While       the     trustees         and\n\nadministrators            of     the       Trust       are,    of     course,       required         to\n\ndischarge their fiduciary duties “solely in the interest of the\n\nretirement systems, participants, and beneficiaries,” id. § 9-\n\n16-40, one would have to be naive to conclude that the State\n\nlacks       any    influence          or    control         when    it    has    the    power       of\n\nappointment.            State control is further evidenced by the facts\n\nthat: (1) the State Treasurer is the custodian of the Trust’s\n\nfunds and has sole authority to issue payments from the funds,\n\nid. §§ 9-1-1320, 9-11-250; (2) the Retirement System Investment\n\nCommission must provide quarterly reports to, among others, the\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro\n\nTempore      of    the       Senate,       id.    §    9-16-90(A);        (3) the      State       must\n\ndefend      and        indemnify       the       members      of    the    Retirement         System\n\nInvestment Commission, id. § 9-16-370; and (4) an entire title\n\nof    the    Code       of     Laws    of    South         Carolina       is    devoted       to    the\n\nextensive regulation of the Retirement System and the Trust.\n\n       In sum, because of the mixed indications as to control, we\n\nconclude that application of the control factor, if not favoring\n\nsovereign immunity, is inconclusive.                           Accord Oberg, 745 F.3d at\n\n141    (finding          that    the       control         factor    “present[ed]         a    close\n\nquestion” in light of the fact that the board of directors was\n\nlargely        composed          of        “state          officials       or     gubernatorial\n\nappointees” but also “exercise[d] corporate powers including the\n\n                                                      22\n\fcapacity to contract and sue and be sued”); Almond, 612 F. Supp.\n\nat 227 (holding that the control factor did “not weigh heavily\n\nin favor of either party,” after noting the detailed statutory\n\nregime, the political nature of the appointment of the members\n\nof   the   board    of    trustees,      the    retirement    system’s     corporate\n\nstatus, and the board’s powers to sue and be sued and to buy and\n\nsell property).\n\n       Turning     to    the    factor    considering      whether   the    entities’\n\nconcerns are local or statewide, we conclude that this factor\n\ncounsels    in   favor     of    sovereign      immunity.      In    assessing     this\n\nfactor, courts must consider whether the entity has statewide or\n\nlocalized jurisdiction, Cash, 242 F.3d at 226, and “whether an\n\nentity’s    functions          are   ‘classified      as    typically      state    or\n\nunquestionably local,’” Harter v. Vernon, 101 F.3d 334, 341 (4th\n\nCir.   1996)     (quoting       Hess,    513   U.S.   at   45).      The   Retirement\n\nSystem covers public employees throughout the State.                        And like\n\n“educating the [State’s] youth,” Md. Stadium Auth. v. Ellerbe\n\nBecket, Inc., 407 F.3d 255, 265 (4th Cir. 2005), providing for\n\npublic employees -- many of whom work for the State -- upon\n\nretirement is an area of statewide concern.                       Accord Pub. Sch.\n\nRet. Sys., 640 F.3d at 829 (“[T]he Retirement Systems do not\n\nfurnish the type of local services that political subdivisions\n\ntypically furnish, such as ‘water service, flood control, [or]\n\nrubbish disposal’” (quoting Moor v.

This\n\nfactor requires courts to consider “the relevant state statutes,\n\nregulations,    and     constitutional          provisions       which   characterize\n\nthe entity, and the holdings of state courts on the question.”\n\nHarter, 101 F.3d at 342.         Title 9 of the Code of Laws of South\n\nCarolina repeatedly uses the term “State agency” to refer to the\n\nSouth Carolina Retirement System and the term “State agent” to\n\nrefer to the Director of the Retirement System.                      S.C. Code Ann.\n\n§§ 9-3-20(4), 9-5-30(5) to –30(6).                 The Code also describes the\n\nSouth    Carolina     Public    Employee           Benefit       Authority     as    “an\n\nadministrative agency of state government.”                        Id. § 9-4-10(H).\n\nSimilarly,     in     Layman,   the        South        Carolina     Supreme        Court\n\n                                           24\n\fcharacterized       the    Retirement       System    as    a    “state      agency”   for\n\npurposes of S.C. Code Ann. § 15-77-300, which permits an award\n\nof attorneys fees to the prevailing party in an action brought\n\nby or against the State or any political subdivision thereof.\n\n658 S.E.2d at 326.             And in Ahrens, the Court analyzed whether,\n\nas an “agency,” the Retirement System created a contract with\n\nthe   working      retirees.        709 S.E.2d       at    58–60.       Indeed,       South\n\nCarolina     courts       have    frequently      referred       to    the     individual\n\npension plans of the Retirement System as agencies.                            See, e.g.,\n\nKennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 549 S.E.2d 243, 251 (S.C. 2001); S.C.\n\nPolice Officers Ret. Sys. v. City of Spartanburg, 391 S.E.2d\n\n239, 241 (S.C. 1990).\n\n      At     bottom,      we     conclude    that     the       relevant       indicators\n\nstrongly indicate that the Retirement System and the Trust are\n\narms of the State of South Carolina and are therefore protected\n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment.                    This conclusion is consistent\n\nwith the holdings of the overwhelming number of federal courts\n\nthat have held that similar retirement systems in other States\n\nare   arms    of   the    State.

State    officials    sued    in     their    official\n\ncapacities      for    retrospective        money   damages      have      the    same\n\nsovereign immunity accorded to the State.                See Buckhannon Bd. &\n\nCare Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S.\n\n598, 609 n.10 (2001); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974);\n\nMartin v. Wood, ___ F.3d ___, No. 13-2283 (4th Cir. Nov. 18,\n\n2014).   Therefore, as did the district court, we hold that the\n\nplaintiffs’ claim against the state officials for the return of\n\ntheir contributions is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n      Second, we agree with plaintiffs that their claim for the\n\nsecond injunction -- to prevent “for all time” the enforcement\n\nof the 2005 Act -- is prospective and seeks to remedy an ongoing\n\nviolation of federal law.             See Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\n\nComm’n, 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002) (“In determining whether the\n\n                                         27\n\fdoctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to\n\nsuit, a court need only conduct a “straightforward inquiry into\n\nwhether    [the]      Complaint     [1] alleges      an    ongoing      violation   of\n\nfederal    law     and     [2] seeks     relief     properly      characterized     as\n\nprospective’”       (first     alteration      in    original)      (quoting   Coeur\n\nd’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. at 296 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part\n\nand   concurring      in    the    judgment)));     see    also    Va.

See Greenhouse v.\n\nMCG Capital Corp., 392 F.3d 650, 660 (4th Cir. 2004) (“[W]e ‘may\n\naffirm the dismissal by the district court upon the basis of any\n\nground supported by the record even if it is not the basis\n\nrelied    upon   by      the   district    court’”     (quoting      Ostrzenski     v.\n\nSeigel, 177 F.3d 245, 253 (4th Cir. 1999))).\n\n      The Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\napplies only where a party “defendant in a suit to enjoin the\n\nenforcement of an act alleged to be unconstitutional” has “some\n\nconnection with the enforcement of the act.”                      209 U.S. at 157;\n\nsee also S.C. Wildlife Fed’n v. Limehouse, 549 F.3d 324, 333\n\n                                          28\n\f(4th Cir. 2008); Lytle v. Griffith, 240 F.3d 404, 410 (4th Cir.\n\n2001).     Thus, we have held that a governor cannot be enjoined by\n\nvirtue of his general duty to enforce the laws, Waste Mgmt.\n\nHoldings, Inc. v. Gilmore, 252 F.3d 316, 331 (4th Cir. 2001),\n\nand that an attorney general cannot be enjoined where he has no\n\nspecific statutory authority to enforce the statute at issue,\n\nMcBurney v. Cuccinelli, 616 F.3d 393, 400 (4th Cir. 2010).                             In\n\ncontrast,     we    have   held   that   a    circuit    court    clerk       bore   the\n\nrequisite connection to the enforcement of state marriage laws\n\nto   be   enjoined      from    enforcing     them,     because   the     clerk      was\n\nresponsible for granting and denying applications for marriage\n\nlicenses.      See Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 371 n.3 (4th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 308 (2014).\n\n       The requirement that there be a relationship between the\n\nstate officials sought to be enjoined and the enforcement of the\n\nstate     statute    prevents     parties     from    circumventing       a    State’s\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.                 See McBurney, 616 F.3d at 399;\n\nLytle, 240 F.3d at 412 (Wilkinson, C.J., dissenting).                           As the\n\nCourt explained in Ex parte Young, if the “constitutionality of\n\nevery act passed by the legislature could be tested by a suit\n\nagainst the governor and attorney general, based upon the theory\n\nthat    the   former,      as   the   executive   of    the   State,    was,      in    a\n\ngeneral sense, charged with the execution of all its laws, and\n\nthe latter, as attorney general, might represent the state in\n\n                                         29\n\flitigation involving the enforcement of its statutes,” it would\n\neviscerate       “the    fundamental    principle     that    [States]         cannot,\n\nwithout their assent, be brought into any court at the suit of\n\nprivate persons.”         209 U.S. at 157 (quoting Fitts v. McGhee, 172\n\nU.S. 516, 530 (1899)).\n\n      In this case, the plaintiffs named as defendants members of\n\nthe State Budget and Control Board, the Executive Director of\n\nthe State Budget and Control Board, and the Executive Director\n\nof the Public Employee Benefit Authority, seeking to enjoin them\n\nfrom deducting from the plaintiffs’ paychecks the contributions\n\nmandated by the 2005 Act.              The State Budget and Control Board\n\nand the Public Employee Benefit Authority serve as co-trustees\n\nof the Retirement System, S.C. Code Ann. § 9-1-1310, and South\n\nCarolina    law    vests    “general    administration       and    responsibility\n\nfor the proper operation” of the Retirement System in the Public\n\nEmployee     Benefit      Authority,      id.   §§ 9-1-210,        9-11-30.         But\n\nneither    the    State    Budget   and     Control   Board       nor    the    Public\n\nEmployee Benefit Authority has responsibility for ensuring that\n\nemployee contributions to the Retirement System be deducted from\n\nthe   employees’        paychecks   and    transmitted       to    the   Retirement\n\nSystem.     Employers of covered employees are required to deduct\n\nthe requisite contributions from the employees’ paychecks and\n\nfurnish the withheld amounts to the Retirement System, and any\n\nperson     who    fails    to   remit     withheld    contributions            to   the\n\n                                          30\n\fRetirement     System      is   “guilty    of    a    misdemeanor      and   must   be\n\npunished by fine or imprisonment, or both.”                    Id. § 9-11-210(7);\n\nsee also id. § 9-1-1160(A).             The Code of Laws of South Carolina\n\nnowhere gives the Retirement System, the Trust, or the trustees\n\nand administrators of the Retirement System the authority to\n\ndeduct or refuse to deduct funds from participating employees’\n\npaychecks or to prosecute employers who violate their duties.\n\nInstead, the role of the state officials named in the complaint\n\nis merely to wait passively for the funds to be transmitted to\n\nthe    Retirement   System      and,    once    the    funds    have   arrived,     to\n\nmanage and invest them.           As such, the complaint seeks to enjoin\n\nthe    Retirement       System’s       trustees       and    administrators      from\n\nparticipating in a process in which they actually have no role.\n\n       Because the state officials named as defendants have no\n\nconnection with the enforcement of the 2005 Act -- specifically\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 9-1-1790(C) and § 9-11-90(4)(c) -- we hold that\n\nthe Ex parte Young exception does not apply and that the state\n\nofficials are thus entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on\n\nthe claims seeking prospective injunctive relief.\n\n                                          IV\n\n       The   plaintiffs     contend     that    notwithstanding        any   Eleventh\n\nAmendment protection to which the defendants may be entitled,\n\n“sovereign immunity never bars a constitutional takings claim.”\n\nThey    maintain    that    the    Takings      Clause      provides   an    absolute\n\n                                          31\n\fguarantee of just compensation when private property is taken\n\nfor public use and argue that if the States were immune from\n\ntakings claims in federal court, the Fifth Amendment would be\n\n“effectively abrogated” by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n      It is true that under the Eleventh Amendment, States enjoy\n\nsovereign immunity except “where there has been ‘a surrender of\n\nthis immunity in the plan of the convention.’”               Coeur d’Alene\n\nTribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. at 267 (quoting Principality of Monaco\n\nv. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 322-23 (1934)).              But the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized that “the plan of the convention” or the\n\nStates themselves have surrendered sovereign immunity in only\n\nsix contexts: (1) when a State consents to suit; (2) when a case\n\nis   brought   by   the   United   States   or   another   State;   (3) when\n\nCongress abrogates sovereign immunity pursuant to Section 5 of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment or pursuant to the Bankruptcy Clause;\n\n(4) when a suit is brought against an entity that is not an arm\n\nof the State; (5) when a private party sues a state official in\n\nhis official capacity to prevent an ongoing violation of federal\n\nlaw; and (6) when an individual sues a state official in his\n\nindividual capacity for ultra vires conduct.               See S.C. State\n\nPorts Auth. v. Fed. Maritime Comm’n, 243 F.3d 165, 176-77 (4th\n\nCir. 2001), aff’d, 535 U.S. 743 (2002).               The plaintiffs now\n\ninvite us to recognize a seventh exception for claims brought\n\nunder the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n                                     32\n\f       The Fifth Amendment provides that “private property [shall\n\nnot] be taken for public use, without just compensation,” U.S.\n\nConst. amend. V, and the Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he\n\njudicial power of the United States shall not be construed to\n\nextend to any suit . . . , commenced or prosecuted against one\n\nof   the    United    States”    by    citizens     of    that    State   or   another\n\nState, id. amend. XI.                While there is arguably some tension\n\nbetween the protections of these amendments, that tension is not\n\nirreconcilable.\n\n       Just as the Constitution guarantees the payment of just\n\ncompensation for a taking, so too does the Due Process Clause\n\nprovide the right to a remedy for taxes collected in violation\n\nof federal law.            See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic\n\nBeverages & Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 51 (1990).                       But despite the\n\nconstitutional requirement that there be a remedy, the Supreme\n\nCourt expressly noted in Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106 (1994),\n\nthat    “the    sovereign      immunity    [that]    States       enjoy   in   federal\n\ncourt,     under     the    Eleventh    Amendment,       does    generally     bar   tax\n\nrefund claims from being brought in that forum.”                          Id. at 110\n\n(second emphasis added).               To ensure that taxpayers possess an\n\navenue for relief, the Court held that state courts must hear\n\nsuits      to   recover      taxes     unlawfully    exacted,       the   “sovereign\n\nimmunity [that] States traditionally enjoy in their own courts\n\nnotwithstanding.”            Id.; cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 740\n\n                                          33\n\f(1999) (holding that Congress cannot subject States to suits in\n\nstate courts but taking care not to overrule Reich).                         Reasoning\n\nanalogously, we conclude that the Eleventh Amendment bars Fifth\n\nAmendment taking claims against States in federal court when the\n\nState’s courts remain open to adjudicate such claims.\n\n     South      Carolina       courts    have      long   recognized    a    right   of\n\npersons    to    sue   the     State    for    unconstitutional      takings.        See\n\nGraham v. Charleston Cnty. Sch. Bd., 204 S.E.2d 384, 386 (S.C.\n\n1974) (“In this jurisdiction neither the State nor any of its\n\npolitical subdivisions is liable in an action ex delicto unless\n\nby express enactment of the General Assembly, except where the\n\nacts complained of, in effect, constitute a taking of private\n\nproperty    for     public     use     without     just   compensation”      (emphasis\n\nadded)), overruled on other grounds by McCall v. Batson, 329\n\nS.E.2d 741 (S.C. 1985).               Because the plaintiffs can have their\n\ntakings    claims      heard     in     South      Carolina   state    courts,       the\n\nEleventh Amendment does not render the Takings Clause an empty\n\npromise.        But in concluding that the Fifth Amendment Takings\n\nClause does not, in this case, trump the Eleventh Amendment, we\n\ndo not decide the question whether a State can close its doors\n\nto   a    takings      claim    or     the     question    whether     the    Eleventh\n\nAmendment would ban a takings claim in federal court if the\n\nState courts were to refuse to hear such a claim.\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\f       The plaintiffs direct our attention to numerous cases in\n\nwhich     suits       to       recover        property         illegally          seized        by    the\n\ngovernment       were       held      not     to    have       been        barred    by     sovereign\n\nimmunity.        But in none of those cases did the plaintiffs sue\n\neither the sovereign itself or its alter ego.                                     For example, in\n\nUnited    States       v.      Lee,     106     U.S.      196,       222     (1882),       the       Court\n\npermitted       an     ejectment            action        to     proceed          against       federal\n\nofficers       who    served       as    custodians            of    the     estate       of    General\n\nRobert    E.    Lee     because         the     suit      was       not     against       the    United\n\nStates.        In Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204 (1897), the Court\n\npermitted a suit against two state officials to recover property\n\nwrongly held by them on behalf of the State, because the case\n\nwas “a suit against individuals,” id. at 221, and the Court\n\ncould not perceive how it could “be regarded as one against the\n\nstate,” id. at 218.                   And in Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural\n\nCollege    of     South        Carolina,       221      U.S.        636,    648-49     (1911),         the\n\nCourt    permitted         a    suit     alleging         a    takings        claim       to    proceed\n\nagainst a university, but under the law in effect at the time,\n\nthe fact that the university was set up as a corporation meant\n\nthat it was not an arm of the State, see P.R. Ports Auth. v.\n\nFed.    Mar.    Comm’n,         531     F.3d       868,    884       (D.C.    Cir.     2008).           By\n\ncontrast, in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337\n\nU.S.    682,    689     (1949),         the    Court      dismissed          an     action      brought\n\nagainst the head of the War Assets Administration alleging that\n\n                                                   35\n\fhe had refused to deliver coal that he had contracted to sell to\n\nthe plaintiff and seeking an injunction prohibiting him from\n\nselling   or   delivering    that   coal   to   anyone    else,   because   the\n\nrelief sought was “against the sovereign.”               And while the Court\n\nhas   sometimes    decided     takings      claims    without     considering\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, see, e.g., Brown v. Legal Found. of\n\nWash., 538 U.S. 216 (2003); Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505\n\nU.S. 1003 (1992), we cannot glean much from that fact given that\n\na State can waive its Eleventh Amendment protection.\n\n      Finally, we note that every other court of appeals to have\n\ndecided the question has held that the Takings Clause does not\n\noverride the Eleventh Amendment.           See Seven Up Pete Venture v.\n\nSchweitzer, 523 F.3d 948, 954 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[W]e conclude\n\nthat the constitutionally grounded self-executing nature of the\n\nTakings Clause does not alter the conventional application of\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment”); DLX, Inc. v. Kentucky, 381 F.3d 511,\n\n526 (6th Cir. 2004) (“Treating DLX’s claim as a self-executing\n\nreverse condemnation claim, . . . we conclude that the Eleventh\n\nAmendment’s    grant   of    immunity      protects   Kentucky     from     that\n\nclaim . . .”); Harbert Int’l, Inc. v. James, 157 F.3d 1271, 1279\n\n(11th Cir. 1998) (holding that a takings claim was barred under\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment, where state courts provided a means of\n\nredress for such claims); John G. & Marie Stella Kenedy Mem’l\n\nFound. v. Mauro, 21 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that\n\n                                     36\n\fthe district court “correctly determined that the Foundation’s\n\nFifth     Amendment     inverse      condemnation       claim    brought      directly\n\nagainst      the    State     of    Texas”       was   barred   by    the     Eleventh\n\nAmendment); Citadel Corp. v.

Acts   1697      (“the    2005    Act”).         That    Act     amended    South\n\nCarolina’s    retirement        laws    by    requiring       public    employees    who\n\nretire and then return to work to make, beginning on July 1,\n\n2005, the same contributions to state-created pension plans as\n\npre-retirement employees but without receiving further pension\n\nbenefits.     The plaintiffs claimed that the 2005 Act effected a\n\ntaking of their private property, in violation of the Takings\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth    Amendment.          They       named    as     defendants    two    state-\n\ncreated pension plans, in which they are participants; the South\n\nCarolina    Retirement     Systems       Group       Trust    (“the    Trust”),    which\n\nholds the pension plans’ assets; and state officials serving as\n\ntrustees and administrators of the pension plans.                         For relief,\n\nthey    sought     repayment      of    all      contributions         withheld    since\n\nJuly 1,    2005,     and   injunctive         relief       prohibiting     the    future\n\ncollection of such contributions.\n\n       Pursuant    to   the     defendants’       motion,       the    district    court\n\ndismissed the complaint on the ground that all of the defendants\n\nare entitled to sovereign immunity.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       We affirm, albeit on reasoning slightly different from that\n\ngiven by the district court.                      We conclude, as did the district\n\ncourt, that the pension plans and the Trust are arms of the\n\nState of South Carolina and therefore have sovereign immunity.\n\nLikewise, we conclude that the state officials sued in their\n\nofficial capacities for repayment of pension-plan contributions\n\nhave sovereign immunity.                    Finally, we conclude that the state\n\nofficials       sued      in    their       official       capacities        for     prospective\n\ninjunctive relief have sovereign immunity because their duties\n\nbear    no    relation         to    the    collection        of     the    public   employees’\n\ncontributions to the pension plans, precluding application of Ex\n\nparte      Young,      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span>          <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>    <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">        (1908).         In     reaching       these\n\nconclusions,         we    reject          the    plaintiffs’         argument       that    their\n\nclaims       under   the       Takings       Clause      of    the    Fifth    Amendment       are\n\nexempt from the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n                                                   I\n\n       The plaintiffs are public employees and participants in two\n\npension plans created by South Carolina in 1962 -- the South\n\nCarolina       Retirement            System       and    the       South     Carolina       Police\n\nOfficers       Retirement            System       (collectively,             “the     Retirement\n\nSystem”). 1      See S.C.

In their\n\n\n       1\n       In all, South Carolina has created five pension plans for\npublic employees, each referred to as a “Retirement System” --\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fcomplaint, they alleged that they and others similarly situated\n\nare “retired contributing members” of the Retirement System, who\n\nreturned to work on or after July 1, 2005, when the 2005 Act\n\nwent   into     effect,    and    who    are,     by    reason    of   the     2005 Act,\n\nrequired “to contribute a portion of their gross earnings” to\n\nthe Retirement System “without receiving any additional service\n\ncredit    or    interest     on   their        retirement       accounts.”          Before\n\nJuly 1, 2005, retired participants could return to work for a\n\nsalary of up to $50,000 without forfeiting the right to receive\n\nretirement      benefits        and     without        having    to    make         further\n\ncontributions to the Retirement System.

In addition to naming as defendants\n\nthe two pension plans, the plaintiffs named the Trust, which\n\nholds the assets of the Retirement System, and a number of state\n\nofficials    in     their     official      capacities       who,     as      members    or\n\nexecutive directors of the State Budget and Control Board and\n\nthe Public Employee Benefit Authority, serve as trustees and\n\nadministrators of the Retirement System.

The South Carolina Supreme\nCourt rejected the argument, holding that the “old working\nretiree statute [did] not create a binding contract between the\nState and the old working retirees,” but the court did remand\nthe case to the trial court “for a case by case factual\ndetermination of whether any actions of the State with regard to\nindividual old working retirees constituted a breach of\ncontract.” Layman v.

Ahrens, 709 S.E.2d at 58-60.\nBecause the employees’ claims under the Takings Clause and the\nDue Process Clause were “founded on the presumption that a\ncontractual right ha[d] been unfairly taken away,” the court\nalso affirmed the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment on\nthose claims.

See Oberg, 745 F.3d\n\nat 137.\n\n      We    reject     the     plaintiffs’        various        arguments       to   the\n\ncontrary.    First, they insist that Article X, Section 16 of the\n\nSouth Carolina Constitution “merely compels the State to comply\n\nwith its funding obligations as an employer,” a requirement that\n\nthe    General     Assembly        could    not     have       imposed      on    future\n\nlegislatures by legislative act.                  And they complain that “the\n\nDistrict Court unnecessarily construed the state Constitution in\n\na manner that rendered it irreconcilable with Sections 9-1-1690\n\nand 9-11-280.”       But the South Carolina Supreme Court, which, of\n\ncourse,     has the last word on the meaning of the South Carolina\n\nConstitution, rejected the plaintiffs’ posited construction of\n\nArticle X,     Section 16.           See    Wehle,       611       S.E.2d   at 242-43.\n\nMoreover,    the     plaintiffs’      argument         that   we    must    construe    a\n\nconstitutional provision so as not to conflict with a statute\n\nturns the concept of constitutional supremacy on its head.\n\n      Second, the plaintiffs maintain that there is no evidence\n\nthat a judgment in their favor would in fact create a shortfall\n\nin    the   Retirement       System’s      funds.         Yet,      given    that     the\n\nplaintiffs’ complaint alleges that “the members of the proposed\n\n                                           15\n\fclass will exceed tens of thousands of persons,” it is surely\n\nplausible that a favorable judgment could create an actuarial\n\ndeficit.     More     importantly,         whether        or    not    a   judgment        would\n\nrender the Retirement System insolvent is of little consequence\n\nto the analysis.

Here, as in\n\nErnst, the “plaintiffs fail to come to grips with the fiscal\n\n                                               16\n\freality    that    the    State’s   funding   requirement       assuredly   could\n\nincrease if the retirement system were to use its current and\n\nfuture funding to pay off a judgment against it.”                        427 F.3d\n\nat 362 (emphasis added).\n\n     Third,     the    plaintiffs    read   much   into   the    fact    that   the\n\nfunds and assets of the Retirement System “are not funds of the\n\nState,” S.C. Code Ann. § 9-1-1310(C), but instead are held “in a\n\ngroup   trust     under    Section 401(a)(24)      of   the   Internal    Revenue\n\nCode,” id. § 9-16-20(C).             Section 401(a)(24) of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code requires that group trust funds not be “used for,\n\nor diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit\n\nof . . .    employees or their beneficiaries in order to qualify\n\nas a group trust.”            26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(24).            While we have\n\nrecognized that holding funds in a segregated account apart from\n\ngeneral state funds does “counsel[] against establishing arm-of-\n\nthe-state status,” Oberg, 745 F.3d at 139, that fact is not\n\ndispositive.       The plaintiffs also argue that South Carolina is\n\nviolating § 401(a)(24) by diverting the contributions they made\n\nto the Retirement System to benefit pre-retirement employees.\n\nBut even if South Carolina were indeed in violation of federal\n\nlaw by using funds contrary to § 401(a)(24), that fact would be\n\nirrelevant to whether a judgment against the Retirement System\n\nor   the   Trust      could   potentially     affect    the     State   treasury.\n\nAccord Ernst, 427 F.3d at 365.\n\n                                       17\n\f       Fourth, the plaintiffs argue that courts generally, and the\n\ndistrict court in particular, should wait until the completion\n\nof    discovery       and   the      development        of    a   factual      record       before\n\nresolving       the    sovereign         immunity       issue.

The means by\n\nwhich   the   entities’     officers   are    appointed    suggest    that   the\n\nRetirement System is beholden to the State.                The State Budget\n\nand Control Board and the Public Employee Benefit Authority,\n\nwhich   are   the   co-trustees   of   the    Retirement    System,    and   the\n\nRetirement    System   Investment      Commission,     which    has   exclusive\n\nauthority to invest the Trust’s assets, see S.C.

While       the     trustees         and\n\nadministrators            of     the       Trust       are,    of     course,       required         to\n\ndischarge their fiduciary duties “solely in the interest of the\n\nretirement systems, participants, and beneficiaries,” id. § 9-\n\n16-40, one would have to be naive to conclude that the State\n\nlacks       any    influence          or    control         when    it    has    the    power       of\n\nappointment.            State control is further evidenced by the facts\n\nthat: (1) the State Treasurer is the custodian of the Trust’s\n\nfunds and has sole authority to issue payments from the funds,\n\nid. §§ 9-1-1320, 9-11-250; (2) the Retirement System Investment\n\nCommission must provide quarterly reports to, among others, the\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro\n\nTempore      of    the       Senate,       id.    §    9-16-90(A);        (3) the      State       must\n\ndefend      and        indemnify       the       members      of    the    Retirement         System\n\nInvestment Commission, id. § 9-16-370; and (4) an entire title\n\nof    the    Code       of     Laws    of    South         Carolina       is    devoted       to    the\n\nextensive regulation of the Retirement System and the Trust.\n\n       In sum, because of the mixed indications as to control, we\n\nconclude that application of the control factor, if not favoring\n\nsovereign immunity, is inconclusive.

The State Budget and Control Board\n\nand the Public Employee Benefit Authority serve as co-trustees\n\nof the Retirement System, S.C.

But\n\nneither    the    State    Budget   and     Control   Board       nor    the    Public\n\nEmployee Benefit Authority has responsibility for ensuring that\n\nemployee contributions to the Retirement System be deducted from\n\nthe   employees’        paychecks   and    transmitted       to    the   Retirement\n\nSystem.     Employers of covered employees are required to deduct\n\nthe requisite contributions from the employees’ paychecks and\n\nfurnish the withheld amounts to the Retirement System, and any\n\nperson     who    fails    to   remit     withheld    contributions            to   the\n\n                                          30\n\fRetirement     System      is   “guilty    of    a    misdemeanor      and   must   be\n\npunished by fine or imprisonment, or both.”                    Id. § 9-11-210(7);\n\nsee also id. § 9-1-1160(A).             The Code of Laws of South Carolina\n\nnowhere gives the Retirement System, the Trust, or the trustees\n\nand administrators of the Retirement System the authority to\n\ndeduct or refuse to deduct funds from participating employees’\n\npaychecks or to prosecute employers who violate their duties.\n\nInstead, the role of the state officials named in the complaint\n\nis merely to wait passively for the funds to be transmitted to\n\nthe    Retirement   System      and,    once    the    funds    have   arrived,     to\n\nmanage and invest them.           As such, the complaint seeks to enjoin\n\nthe    Retirement       System’s       trustees       and    administrators      from\n\nparticipating in a process in which they actually have no role.\n\n       Because the state officials named as defendants have no\n\nconnection with the enforcement of the 2005 Act -- specifically\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 9-1-1790(C) and § 9-11-90(4)(c) -- we hold that\n\nthe Ex parte Young exception does not apply and that the state\n\nofficials are thus entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on\n\nthe claims seeking prospective injunctive relief.\n\n                                          IV\n\n       The   plaintiffs     contend     that    notwithstanding        any   Eleventh\n\nAmendment protection to which the defendants may be entitled,\n\n“sovereign immunity never bars a constitutional takings claim.”\n\nThey    maintain    that    the    Takings      Clause      provides   an    absolute\n\n                                          31\n\fguarantee of just compensation when private property is taken\n\nfor public use and argue that if the States were immune from\n\ntakings claims in federal court, the Fifth Amendment would be\n\n“effectively abrogated” by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n      It is true that under the Eleventh Amendment, States enjoy\n\nsovereign immunity except “where there has been ‘a surrender of\n\nthis immunity in the plan of the convention.’”               Coeur d’Alene\n\nTribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. at 267 (quoting Principality of Monaco\n\nv.
