At issue here is section 21.202 of the TCHRA, which obligates a claimant to file a complaint\n\nwith the Texas Workforce Commission civil rights division (TWC) or the Equal Employment\n\n\n        1\n          As we have previously observed, courts refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the Texas Commission on\nHuman Rights Act. Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams, 313 S.W .3d 796, 798 n.1 (Tex. 2010). However, the Commission\non Human Rights has been replaced with the Texas W orkforce Commission civil rights division. Id. Throughout this\nopinion, we refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the TCHRA.\n\n        2\n            Title VII is codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.\n\fOpportunity Commission (EEOC) not later than the 180th day after the date an allegedly unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurs. The term “occur” is not defined in the TCHRA, but we have\n\npreviously interpreted it to mean when a discriminatory employment decision is made—not when\n\nthe effects of that decision become manifest in later events. Our interpretation mirrored the United\n\nStates Supreme Court’s interpretation of Title VII until recently. But, in 2009, Congress enacted the\n\nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (Ledbetter Act), amending Title VII to provide that a discriminatory pay\n\ndecision occurs each time a paycheck is received and not just when an initial salary decision is\n\nmade.3 Thus, when a claimant files a discriminatory pay claim under federal law, the 180-day\n\nlimitations period begins each time a claimant receives a paycheck containing a discriminatory\n\namount. The Texas Legislature has not similarly amended the TCHRA.\n\n       As a matter of first impression, we must determine whether the federal Ledbetter Act applies\n\nto a claim brought under the TCHRA so that the 180-day limitations period begins anew each time\n\na claimant receives a paycheck containing a discriminatory amount. Because Title VII and the\n\nTCHRA are no longer analogous where discriminatory pay claims are concerned, and because the\n\nLegislature—and not this Court—is the proper governmental branch to amend the TCHRA, we hold\n\nthat the federal Ledbetter Act does not apply to a claim brought under the TCHRA. Thus, in\n\naccordance with the TCHRA and our precedent, we conclude that a pay discrimination complaint\n\nmust generally be brought within 180 days of the date the claimant is informed of the compensation\n\ndecision. We further hold that the 180-day filing requirement is a mandatory statutory requirement\n\n\n\n       3\n           See Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111–2, 123 Stat. 5.\n\n                                                          2\n\fthat must be complied with before filing suit, and, as such, is a statutory prerequisite to suit under\n\nsection 311.034 of the Government Code. Because the claimant here failed to timely file her\n\ncomplaint with the TWC, we conclude that her suit is jurisdictionally barred by section 311.034. We\n\ntherefore reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment dismissing the suit.\n\n                                   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n         Respondent Dr. Diljit K. Chatha is a professor at Prairie View A&M University (the\n\nUniversity). Chatha began employment at the University in 1987 and applied for a promotion from\n\nassociate professor to full professor in 2003. She was initially denied the promotion but received\n\nit in 2004. At that time, she complained to the University that her salary was inequitable but was\n\ntold there were no funds available for a salary adjustment. About two years after her promotion,\n\nChatha filed a complaint with the EEOC and the TWC, alleging race and nationality-based pay\n\ndiscrimination. Chatha is of Indian national origin. In her complaint, Chatha marked the\n\n“continuing action” box, alleging discrimination between September 1, 2005 and September 26,\n\n2005.4 After receiving right-to-sue notices from the EEOC and the TWC, Chatha filed suit against\n\nthe University in state court under the TCHRA. The University responded by filing a plea to the\n\njurisdiction, asserting Chatha’s TWC complaint was untimely filed pursuant to the 180-day\n\n\n\n         4\n            A claimant may file a complaint with either the EEOC, the federal agency authorized to investigate charges\nof discrimination, or the TW C, the Texas equivalent. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); T EX . L AB . C O DE §§ 21.201, .202;\n40 T EX . A DM IN . C OD E . § 819.41(c). If a state has its own employment discrimination laws, as Texas does, Title VII\nrequires the EEOC to defer charges of discrimination it receives from employees in those states to state or local fair\nemployment practices agencies for at least sixty days, in this case the TW C, so that attempts to resolve disputes can first\nbe undertaken under state law. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(c); see Schroeder v. Tex. Iron Works, Inc., 813 S.W .2d 483, 485\n(Tex. 1991) (overruled on other grounds by In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307 S.W .3d 299, 310 (Tex. 2010)). Thus,\ncharges that are filed by Texas employees with the EEOC are contemporaneously filed with the TW C. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5(d).\n\n                                                             3\n\flimitations period under the TCHRA. See TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202. The University specifically\n\nalleged that Chatha was aware of the alleged discriminatory salary in 2004, yet failed to file a\n\ncomplaint until 2006. Chatha responded that the federal Ledbetter Act applies to a discriminatory\n\npay claim brought under the TCHRA because one of the TCHRA’s purposes is to execute the\n\npolicies of Title VII. See id. § 21.001(1). The trial court denied the University’s plea.\n\n         The University brought an interlocutory appeal, see TEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM . CODE\n\n§ 51.014(a)(8), and the court of appeals affirmed, holding that the Ledbetter Act applies to claims\n\nbrought under the TCHRA, and Chatha’s claim was therefore timely because she received a\n\npaycheck containing an alleged discriminatory amount within 180 days of the date she filed her\n\ncomplaint with the TWC. 317 S.W.3d 402, 404, 407. In reaching this decision, the court of appeals\n\nrelied on (1) the general purposes provision of the TCHRA, and (2) two federal district court\n\ndecisions that had applied the Ledbetter Act to the TCHRA. Id. at 407. We granted review to\n\ndetermine whether the Ledbetter Act applies to a pay discrimination claim brought under the\n\nTCHRA.5\n\n\n\n\n         5\n           W e have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to Texas Government Code sections 22.001 and\n22.225 because the court of appeals in this case held differently from a prior decision of another court of appeals on a\nquestion of law material to the resolution of this case. See T EX . G O V ’T C O D E §§ 22.001(a)(2), 22.225 (c); compare 317\nS.W .3d at 409, with, e.g., Cooper-Day v. RME Petroleum Co., 121 S.W .3d 78, 83–84 (Tex. App.— Fort W orth 2003,\npet. denied) (concluding that pay discrimination occurs when an employee is informed of the discriminatory pay, not\nwhen the last discriminatory paycheck is received).\n\n                                                             4\n\f                                                      II. Analysis\n\n                                               A. Legal Framework\n\n         The TCHRA was “enacted to address the specific evil of discrimination and retaliation in the\n\nworkplace,” as well as to coordinate and conform with federal anti-discrimination and retaliation\n\nlaws under Title VII. See City of Waco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 153–55 (Tex. 2008). Although\n\nfrom its inception the TCHRA was not an exact replica of Title VII, both the TCHRA and Title VII\n\nsimilarly define unlawful employment practice,6 and as part of each act’s administrative process\n\nimpose a strict 180-day statute of limitations for filing an employment discrimination complaint with\n\nthe appropriate governmental agency, running from the date the alleged unlawful employment\n\npractice occurs. The TCHRA provides:\n\n         (a)       A complaint under this subchapter must be filed not later than the 180th day\n                   after the date the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\n\n         (b)       The [TWC] shall dismiss an untimely complaint.\n\nTEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202.7 Prior to the federal Ledbetter Act’s enactment in 2009, Title VII and the\n\nTCHRA contained virtually identical language concerning the 180-day limitations period.\n\n\n\n         6\n           Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.”), with T EX . L AB . C O D E § 21.051 (“An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because\nof race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer: (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual,\ndischarges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation\nor the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant\nfor employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or\nadversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee.”).\n\n         7\n           Similarly, Title VII provides that “[a] charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty\ndays after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1).\n\n                                                             5\n\f       Although we have always considered the TCHRA’s plain language and our precedent in\n\ninterpreting the TCHRA, see, e.g., Caballero v. Central Power & Light Co., 858 S.W.2d 359,\n\n359–61 (Tex. 1993), we have looked to federal law for guidance in situations where the TCHRA and\n\nTitle VII contain analogous statutory language, see, e.g., Specialty Retailers v. DeMoranville, 933\n\nS.W.2d 490, 492 (Tex. 1996) (per curiam). Therefore, we previously looked to federal case law in\n\ninterpreting the 180-day limitations provision in section 21.202 for defining when an unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurs. See id. In Speciality Retailers, we held that the 180-day limitations\n\nperiod in the TCHRA commences “when the employee is informed of the allegedly discriminatory\n\nemployment decision, not when that decision comes to fruition.” Id. at 493. There, an employee\n\nwas informed that she would be fired if her leave of absence lasted longer than one year. Id. at 492.\n\nWhen the employee did not return to work after a year, her employment was terminated. Id. We\n\nconcluded that the 180-day limitations period began when the employee was informed of the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory policy, not when her employment was actually terminated a year later. Id. at 493.\n\nWe noted a distinction between an act of continuing discrimination and an effect of past\n\ndiscrimination, and determined that the termination of her employment after a year’s leave of\n\nabsence could only be considered an effect of past discrimination. Id.\n\n       We cited as authority United States Supreme Court precedent—specifically, the Ricks\n\ndecision—in reaching our conclusion. See id. at 492–93 (citing Del. State Coll. v. Ricks, 449 U.S.\n\n250, 258 (1980)). In Ricks, a professor was denied tenure, and in accordance with the university’s\n\npolicy regarding unsuccessful tenure applicants, Ricks was instead offered a “terminal” one year\n\ncontract. 449 U.S. at 253. Two months before his termination, Ricks filed an EEOC complaint\n\n                                                  6\n\falleging employment discrimination. Id. at 254. The Supreme Court held that Ricks’s complaint\n\nwas barred because it was filed more than 180 days after he was notified of the Board’s decision to\n\ndeny tenure. Id. at 257–58. It was the denial of tenure that constituted the allegedly discriminatory\n\nemployment decision, not the actual termination one year later. Id. at 258. The Supreme Court\n\nnoted that it is possible for the effects of a discriminatory employment practice to be most painful\n\nat a time far removed from the discriminatory decision itself, but, nonetheless, the discriminatory\n\nact occurs when the discriminatory decision is made. Id.8\n\n         Twenty-seven years later, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the holding of Ricks in Ledbetter\n\nv. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628–29 (2007). In Ledbetter, the Court recognized\n\nthat a paycheck containing a discriminatory amount is not a present violation, but rather the effect\n\nof a prior act of discrimination. Id. at 628. The Court reasoned that the claimant could not shift the\n\ndiscriminatory intent from the initial salary decision to her paychecks, which were issued without\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Id. at 629. Although the Court empathized with the employee’s policy\n\narguments, it reasoned that those arguments found no support in the statute and that holding as such\n\nwould be inconsistent with prior precedent. Id. at 642–43.\n\n\n\n\n         8\n           See also Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002) (noting that “termination, failure\nto promote, denial of transfer, [and] refusal to hire” are examples of discrete acts of employment discrimination, and\nholding that a Title VII plaintiff “can only file a charge to cover discrete acts that ‘occurred’ within the appropriate time\nperiod”); Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 905–06 (1989) (observing that a discriminatory act occurs at the\ntime of the discriminatory act, not when the consequences of the act start having a discriminatory effect, and holding that\ncomplaints concerning a seniority system occurred when the system was adopted with discriminatory intent); United\nAirlines v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 560 (1977) (holding that a challenge to a neutral seniority system “may not be\npredicated on the mere fact that a past event which has no present legal significance has affected the calculation of\nseniority credit, even if the past event might at one time have justified a valid claim against the employer”).\n\n                                                             7\n\f       In response, Congress enacted the Ledbetter Act, which amended Title VII to provide in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n       [A]n unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in\n       compensation in violation of this subchapter, when a discriminatory compensation\n       decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a\n       discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is\n       affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice,\n       including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in\n       whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, the Ledbetter Act expanded the Title VII\n\nlimitations period to allow an employee complaining of pay discrimination to file a complaint within\n\n180 days after the receipt of any allegedly discriminatory paycheck.\n\n       The Texas Legislature has not similarly amended the TCHRA. Since the Ledbetter Act was\n\nenacted in 2009, the Legislature has twice considered but failed to enact proposed legislation\n\nconforming the TCHRA to Title VII in determining when an unlawful employment practice occurs\n\nin pay discrimination claims.9 Thus, under the TCHRA, the term “occur” is still statutorily\n\nundefined, and the controlling authority for interpreting when an unlawful employment practice\n\noccurs remains our holding in Speciality Retailers.\n\n       Chatha argues that we should nonetheless interpret the TCHRA as incorporating the\n\nLedbetter Act’s amendments to Title VII. Chatha primarily relies on the general purposes provision\n\nof the TCHRA, which specifies a purpose of executing the policies of Title VII. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE § 21.001(1). Chatha contends that, relying on this provision, we have frequently looked to\n\n\n\n       9\n           See Tex. S.B. 280, 82d Leg., R.S. (2011); Tex. S.B. 986, 81st Leg., R.S. (2009).\n\n                                                          8\n\ffederal law in interpreting the TCHRA, and should do so here as well. The University counters that\n\nthis Court has only looked to federal law for guidance in circumstances where Title VII and the\n\nTCHRA are analogous and that they are no longer analogous after the Ledbetter Act. We agree with\n\nthe University.\n\n                  B. The TCHRA Does Not Incorporate the Ledbetter Act\n\n       The general purposes provision of the TCHRA states that one of its purposes is to “provide\n\nfor the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent\n\namendments.” Id. We have cited this provision when looking to federal law in interpreting the\n\nTCHRA, and have specifically stated that we should correlate the TCHRA with Title VII when\n\npossible. See, e.g., AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 588, 592 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam). But we\n\nhave never said that the general purposes provision requires the TCHRA to forever remain identical\n\nto Title VII, regardless of subsequent congressional amendments to the federal act. Rather, we\n\nconsider the plain terms of the TCHRA and our precedent, and look to federal law for guidance only\n\nwhen the relevant provisions of Title VII are analogous. See In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307\n\nS.W.3d 299, 308 (Tex. 2010). Here, although the TCHRA and Title VII were previously analogous\n\nregarding when an unlawful employment practice occurs, after the Ledbetter Act, this is no longer\n\ntrue where pay discrimination complaints are concerned. Although Chatha invites us to read the\n\ngeneral purposes provision as requiring the incorporation of subsequent amendments made to Title\n\nVII into the TCHRA, we decline to do so for several reasons.\n\n       First, the TCHRA’s plain language does not evidence a legislative intent that Title VII\n\namendments should be automatically incorporated into its provisions. The plain language of a\n\n                                                9\n\fstatute is the surest guide to the Legislature’s intent. See City of DeSoto v. White, 288 S.W.3d 389,\n\n394 (Tex. 2009). The general purposes provision merely states that the TCHRA’s purpose is to\n\nprovide for the execution of policies embodied in Title VII “and its subsequent amendments.” TEX .\n\nLAB. CODE § 21.001(1). The reference to subsequent Title VII amendments means only that one of\n\nthe TCHRA’s purposes is to execute policies of Title VII as it may be amended, not that those\n\namendments should be automatically incorporated into Texas law. See Fogle v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co.,\n\n800 F. Supp. 495, 499 (W.D. Tex. 1992). Indeed, in enacting the TCHRA in 1983, the Legislature\n\ncould not have foreseen every possible Title VII amendment going forward, and there is no\n\nindication the Legislature intended to automatically adopt every conceivable Title VII amendment,\n\nhowever substantive and far-reaching, into the TCHRA.\n\n       Second, the TCHRA is not identical to Title VII and the Legislature has not indicated an\n\nintent to make it so. For example, the TCHRA requires a plaintiff to file suit within two years after\n\na plaintiff files a charge of discrimination while Title VII lacks this requirement. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE § 21.256. Further, the TCHRA requires a plaintiff to file suit within sixty days of receiving\n\na right-to-sue letter whereas Title VII imposes a deadline of ninety days. Compare id. § 21.254, with\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). Had the Legislature intended the provisions of the TCHRA and Title VII\n\nto be identical, it could have conformed these nonanalogous provisions.\n\n       Finally, the Legislature has never treated the general purposes provision as automatically\n\nincorporating amendments made to Title VII into the TCHRA, but has instead acted legislatively\n\nwhen it wishes to conform the TCHRA to Title VII. One example is when, similar to the Ledbetter\n\nAct, Congress abrogated Supreme Court precedent in the context of discriminatory seniority systems.\n\n                                                 10\n\fIn 1989, the Supreme Court held that complaints regarding a discriminatory seniority system must\n\nbe brought within 180 days after the adoption of the system, not when employees experience the\n\nadverse effects of that system. Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 907–08 (1989). After\n\nLorance, Congress amended Title VII to allow liability from an intentionally discriminatory seniority\n\nsystem not only at the time of its adoption but also at the time of its application. See Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1072, 1078–79.10 After Congress enacted this\n\namendment, the Texas Legislature followed suit by amending the TCHRA to conform it to the new\n\nfederal amendments concerning seniority systems.11 TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.127. If the general\n\npurposes provision automatically incorporated amendments made to Title VII, subsequent\n\nenactments by the Legislature would have been wholly unnecessary.\n\n        Nonetheless, Chatha points to our decision in Caballero as support for her assertion that this\n\nCourt has previously interpreted the general purposes provision to incorporate Title VII provisions\n\ninto the TCHRA. But Caballero does not support this proposition. There, we considered whether\n\na litigant who is authorized to proceed in court under the TCHRA is entitled to a jury trial on\n\ndamages. Caballero, 858 S.W.2d at 359. An employee filed suit against his employer for\n\ndiscrimination and, after a jury trial favorable to the employee, the trial court entered judgment\n\npermitting recovery of monetary damages. Id. The court of appeals, however, concluded that\n\n\n\n        10\n         The Ledbetter Act parallels the language of this amendment with respect to pay discrimination claims.\nCompare 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e)(2), with 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e)(3)(A).\n\n        11\n          Similarly, the Legislature acted in 2009 to amend the TCHRA following congressional amendments to the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Compare ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553,\n3555–58, with Act of May 27, 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., ch. 337, §§ 2–5, 2009 Tex. Gen. Laws 868, 869–70.\n\n                                                      11\n\fbecause the TCHRA is substantially an equitable statute, an employee was first required to obtain\n\nan injunction against his employer’s conduct before being entitled to a jury trial. Id. We reversed,\n\nconcluding that the court of appeals’ reading of the relevant statutes erroneously turned a permissive\n\nprocedure into a mandatory one, and the effect of that reading was inconsistent with the TCHRA as\n\na whole. Id. at 359–60. We further observed that our construction of the relevant statutes was\n\nconsistent with our precedent in injunction proceedings. Id. at 361. Only then did we note that one\n\nstated purpose of the TCHRA is to coordinate and conform TCHRA with Title VII, id., and that\n\nCongress had recently amended Title VII to clarify that a party seeking compensatory or punitive\n\ndamages may demand a jury trial, id. n.4. Thus, we looked to the plain terms of the TCHRA and\n\nrelevant Texas case law in reaching our holding and merely observed that our holding was in line\n\nwith recent amendments to Title VII.\n\n       Finally, Chatha points to two federal district court decisions that predicted Texas courts\n\nwould abandon prior precedent and follow the Ledbetter Act in deciding when a discriminatory pay\n\ndecision occurs under the TCHRA. See Klebe v. Univ. of Tex. Sys. (Klebe II), 649 F. Supp. 2d 568,\n\n571 (W.D. Tex. 2009); Lohn v. Morgan Stanley DW, Inc., 652 F. Supp. 2d 812, 829 (S.D. Tex.\n\n2009). Klebe II stated that the Ledbetter Act simply supplied a missing definition of the term\n\n“occurred” that was absent from prior law. See 649 F. Supp. 2d at 571. Thus, the Klebe II court\n\nsuggested that if the TCHRA and Title VII are expressly different, courts should follow state law,\n\nbut if the TCHRA is silent—such as on the meaning of “occur”—courts should follow the now-\n\ndefined meaning of “occur” in Title VII. See id.\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f       We respectfully disagree that when Congress enacted the Ledbetter Act, it merely supplied\n\na missing definition. Rather, by amendment, it carved out an exception for pay discrimination claims\n\nto the already well-settled Ricks test for when an unlawful employment practice occurs. And while\n\nit is true that the TCHRA—like Title VII before the Ledbetter Act—is statutorily silent as to the\n\ndefinition of “occur,” we have previously held that an unlawful employment practice occurs when\n\nthe employee is informed of the allegedly discriminatory employment decision. See Specialty\n\nRetailers, 933 S.W.2d at 493. But, unlike Congress, the Texas Legislature has not crafted an\n\nexception to this rule for pay discrimination claims. As we have explained, it is the province of the\n\nLegislature to determine whether to enact an exception similar to the Ledbetter Act in the context\n\nof pay discrimination claims under the TCHRA. For this Court to apply a nonanalogous federal\n\nstatute like the Ledbetter Act in the absence of legislative action would require us to abdicate our\n\nrole as interpreters of the law in favor of a lawmaking function. We decline to take that role.\n\n                  C. The TCHRA Bars Chatha’s Pay Discrimination Claims\n\n       Having concluded that the Ledbetter Act does not apply to Chatha’s claims, we next\n\ndetermine whether Chatha’s complaint was untimely filed under the TCHRA. Chatha does not argue\n\nher claims are timely if we conclude the Ledbetter Act does not apply. Nonetheless, because we\n\nhave never directly addressed when a pay discrimination complaint must be filed under the TCHRA,\n\nwe consider whether Chatha’s complaint was untimely. Because the TCHRA and Title VII are no\n\nlonger analogous as to when a discriminatory pay practice occurs, we look solely to our precedent\n\nin making this determination. In Speciality Retailers, we held that the 180-day limitations period\n\nin the TCHRA begins “when the employee is informed of the allegedly discriminatory employment\n\n                                                 13\n\fdecision, not when that decision comes to fruition.” 933 S.W.2d at 493. This is because the\n\ndiscriminatory employment decision is the practice made with discriminatory intent. Our rule\n\napplies with equal force in the context of pay discrimination decisions. See Klebe v. Univ. of Tex.\n\nSys. (Klebe I), No. 03-05-00527-CV, 2007 WL 2214344 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007, no pet.)\n\n(applying our general rule in Specialty Retailers to pay discrimination claims); Cooper-Day v. RME\n\nPetroleum Co., 121 S.W.3d 78, 85 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied) (same).12\n\n         In pay discrimination cases, the setting of an alleged discriminatory pay rate is a discrete\n\nact—that is, the only act taken with a discriminatory motive is the pay-setting decision. Subsequent\n\npaychecks containing an alleged discriminatory pay amount are merely consequences of past\n\ndiscrimination and do not constitute an unlawful employment practice under the TCHRA. Thus, an\n\nemployee must file a complaint under th e TCHRA within 180 days of the date she is informed of\n\nthe alleged discriminatory pay decision.13 Here, Chatha was informed of the alleged discriminatory\n\npay decision when she was promoted to full professor in 2004, yet she did not file a complaint with\n\nthe TWC or the EEOC until 2006.14 Thus, Chatha’s complaint was untimely filed under section\n\n21.202. See TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202.\n\n\n\n         12\n            The court of appeals here acknowledged that if the Ledbetter Act did not apply, each new paycheck would\nnot constitute a new occurrence and Chatha’s complaint would be untimely. 317 S.W .3d at 406.\n\n         13\n           W e note that a situation could arise where an employer has adopted a facially discriminatory payment system\nthat would potentially constitute an act of intentional discrimination anytime the employer issued a check to a disfavored\nemployee. See Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 634; Cooper-Day, 121 S.W .3d at 84. However, neither party alleges that situation\napplies here.\n\n         14\n             Chatha’s complaint of discrimination states that the last day of discrimination was in September 2005.\nHowever, even accepting this as true, her complaint was still filed outside of the 180-day limitations period because she\ndid not file her complaint until September 2006.\n\n                                                           14\n\f                                D. The University’s Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n         Having concluded that Chatha’s complaint was untimely filed under the TCHRA, we next\n\ndetermine whether that failure is a jurisdictional bar to suit. At the trial court, the University filed\n\na combined motion for summary judgment and plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that because Chatha\n\nfailed to comply with section 21.202, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the suit. The Legislature\n\nhas mandated that all statutory prerequisites to suit are jurisdictional in suits against governmental\n\nentities. TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 311.034. Here, it is undisputed that compliance with section 21.202\n\nis mandatory and that the University timely raised Chatha’s failure to comply at the trial court. Thus,\n\nas we will explain below, we conclude that because the University is a governmental entity, and\n\ncompliance with section 21.202 is a statutory prerequisite to suit under Texas Government Code\n\nsection 311.034, the University’s plea should have been granted and the case dismissed.15\n\n                              1. Statutory Prerequisite to Suit Under Section\n                                  311.034 of the Texas Government Code\n\n         Since the Legislature amended section 311.034 of the Government Code in 2005, we have\n\nnot construed its reach. Because there is some confusion among the courts of appeals about section\n\n311.034’s scope, we deem it prudent to review the jurisprudential context from which the statute was\n\namended.\n\n         For decades, Texas courts followed the rule we announced in Mingus v. Wadley, establishing\n\nthat when a cause of action is derived from statute, strict compliance with all statutory prerequisites\n\n\n\n         15\n            Because we conclude section 21.202 is a statutory prerequisite to suit under section 311.034, and is thus a\njurisdictional requirement under that section, we need not decide whether section 21.202 itself is jurisdictional in nature.\n\n\n\n                                                            15\n\fis necessary to vest a trial court with jurisdiction. 285 S.W. 1084, 1087 (Tex. 1926). But in 2000,\n\nin Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi, we quoted the Restatement (Second) of Judgments in noting that\n\n“‘the modern direction of policy is to reduce the vulnerability of final judgments to attack on the\n\nground that the tribunal lacked subject matter jurisdiction,’” 12 S.W.3d 71, 76 (Tex. 2000) (quoting\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF JUDGMENTS § 11 cmt. b, at 118 (1982)), and “overrule[d] Mingus to\n\nthe extent that it characterized the plaintiff’s failure to establish a statutory prerequisite as\n\njurisdictional,” id. Because Dubai involved private litigants, courts of appeals struggled with its\n\napplication in cases against governmental defendants, citing the apparent dichotomy of Dubai’s\n\nholding with the basic tenets of sovereign immunity and our treatment of the doctrine in statutory\n\ncauses of action. See, e.g., King v. Tex. Dep’t of Human Servs., 28 S.W.3d 27, 31 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2000, no pet.).\n\n       In 2004, we expanded our holding in Dubai to governmental entities in Loutzenhiser,\n\nbringing clarity to any lingering confusion in the lower courts. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. at Dallas\n\nv. Loutzenhiser, 140 S.W.3d 351, 359 (Tex. 2004). There, we held that because the pre-suit notice\n\nrequirement in section 101.106(a) of the Texas Tort Claims Act was not a condition of the statute’s\n\nwaiver of immunity, the failure to provide it was not a jurisdictional defect. Id. at 365; see Colquitt\n\nv. Brazoria Cnty, 324 S.W.3d 539, 542 (Tex. 2010). We reasoned that because that provision states\n\n“[a] governmental unit is entitled to receive notice,” there was no question it was a mandatory\n\nstatutory requirement; but, because it did not specify the consequences of a failure to provide notice,\n\nwe concluded it was not a condition precedent to suit and the failure to give notice would not deprive\n\nthe trial court of jurisdiction. Loutzenhiser, 140 S.W.3d at 359, 365; see TEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM .\n\n                                                  16\n\fCODE § 101.101(a); see also Colquitt, 324 S.W.3d at 543.              The Legislature responded to\n\nLoutzenhiser in 2005, amending section 311.034 of the Government Code, entitled “Waiver of\n\nSovereign Immunity,” to make notice requirements, and all other statutory prerequisites to suit,\n\njurisdictional as to governmental entities:\n\n       In order to preserve the legislature’s interest in managing state fiscal matters through\n       the appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign\n       immunity unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language . . . .\n       Statutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are jurisdictional\n       requirements in all suits against a governmental entity.\n\nSee TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 311.034 (emphasis added); Act of May 25, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 1150,\n\n§ 1, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 3783, 3783. This amendment evinces the Legislature’s intent that all\n\nstatutory prerequisites are now jurisdictional requirements as to governmental entities and are\n\nproperly asserted in a plea to the jurisdiction. See Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. at Dallas v. Estate of\n\nArancibia, 324 S.W.3d 544, 546 (Tex. 2010); Colquitt, 324 S.W.3d at 543.\n\n       Accordingly, we must determine whether the 180-day filing deadline in the TCHRA is a\n\nstatutory prerequisite to suit under section 311.034. We rely on statutory interpretation principles\n\nto ascertain and “give effect to the Legislature’s intent as expressed by the statute’s language.”\n\nGalbraith Eng’g Consultants, Inc. v. Pochucha, 290 S.W.3d 863, 867 (Tex. 2009). We use\n\ndefinitions prescribed by the Legislature and any particular meaning the words have acquired. City\n\nof Rockwall v. Hughes, 246 S.W.3d 621, 625 (Tex. 2008) (citing Texas Government Code section\n\n311.011(b)).\n\n       The term “statutory prerequisite” has three components. First, it is of obvious mention that\n\nin order to fall within the ambit of section 311.034, a prerequisite must be found in the relevant\n\n                                                  17\n\fstatutory language. See Colquitt, 324 S.W.3d at 543 (recognizing that although the statute called for\n\npre-suit notice, it also provided that formal notice is not required when the government has obtained\n\ntimely actual notice, and thus because the government had actual notice, the failure to provide formal\n\nnotice did not act as a statutory prerequisite to suit). Second, the prerequisite must be a\n\nrequirement.16 And finally, the term “pre” indicates the requirement must be met before the lawsuit\n\nis filed. See Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cnty., 341 S.W.3d 919, 925 (Tex. 2011) (holding that post-suit\n\nnotice requirement was not jurisdictional, even in light of section 311.034, because post-suit notice\n\nis not a “prerequisite” to suit). Thus, according to the plain language of section 311.034, the term\n\n“statutory prerequisite” refers to statutory provisions that are mandatory and must be accomplished\n\nprior to filing suit.\n\n        This interpretation is supported by the particular meaning the term “statutory prerequisite”\n\nhas acquired in our precedent. In drafting section 311.034, the Legislature took special care to use\n\nthe term we articulated in Dubai. While in Mingus we held that all “statutory provisions are\n\nmandatory and exclusive,” 285 S.W. at 1087, in Dubai we “overrule[d] Mingus to the extent that it\n\ncharacterized the plaintiff’s failure to establish a statutory prerequisite as jurisdictional,” 12 S.W.3d\n\nat 76 (emphasis added). With the 2005 amendment to section 311.034—that statutory prerequisites\n\nare jurisdictional in all suits against a governmental entity—the Legislature effectively abrogated our\n\nholding in Loutzenhiser and reverted to our broader holding in Mingus in suits against a\n\ngovernmental entity. See Mingus, 285 S.W. at 1087 (concluding that in suits against a governmental\n\n\n        16\n             The common meaning of the word requisite is “essential,” “necessary.” W EBSTER ’S N EW C O LLEGIA TE\nD IC TIO N ARY 976 (1980).\n\n                                                       18\n\fentity, “where the cause of action and remedy for its enforcement are derived not from the common\n\nlaw but from statute, the statutory provisions are mandatory and exclusive, and must be complied\n\nwith in all respects or the action is not maintainable”). The Legislature’s mandate is clear: In a\n\nstatutory cause of action against a governmental entity, the failure to adhere to the statute’s\n\nmandatory provisions that must be accomplished before filing suit is a jurisdictional bar to suit.17\n\n         Our interpretation is consistent with the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Sovereign\n\nimmunity bars suits against the state and its entities, and this immunity remains intact unless\n\nsurrendered in express and unequivocal terms by the statute’s clear and unambiguous waiver. TEX .\n\nGOV ’T CODE § 311.034; Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 225–26 (Tex.\n\n2004). In this way, the Legislature specifically carves out particular substantive claims for which\n\nthe State will consent to suit and provides the procedures a litigant must follow to obtain such\n\nwaiver. We have observed that in order to allow the Legislature to protect not only its policy-making\n\nfunction but also to preserve its interest in managing state fiscal matters, this Court consistently\n\ndefers to the Legislature to waive immunity from suit. See, e.g., Harris Cnty. Hosp. Dist. v. Tomball\n\nReg’l Hosp., 283 S.W.3d 838, 848 (Tex. 2009) (“‘In a world with increasingly complex webs of\n\ngovernmental units, the Legislature is better suited to make the distinctions, exceptions, and\n\nlimitations that different situations require.’”) (quoting City of Galveston v. State, 217 S.W.3d 466,\n\n         17\n            It is relevant to note that the Legislature has also made clear that statutory prerequisites are not only\nmandatory but also jurisdictional in the context of a statute’s filing limitations period in wage claims. In Igal v.\nBrightstar Information Technology Group, Inc., we held that a Texas Labor Code Chapter 61 filing limitations period\nwas mandatory but not jurisdictional. 250 S.W .3d 78, 86 (Tex. 2008). In response to this holding, the Legislature\namended Chapter 61 to clarify that the 180-day filing deadline for wage claims is jurisdictional and to require the\ndismissal of untimely wage claims for lack of jurisdiction. See T EX . L AB . C O D E § 61.051(c) (“The 180-day deadline is\na matter of jurisdiction.”); id. § 61.052 (“If a wage claim is filed later than the date described by Section 61.051(c), the\nexaminer shall dismiss the wage claim for lack of jurisdiction.”).\n\n                                                            19\n\f469 (Tex. 2007))); Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 857 (Tex.\n\n2002) (“We again reaffirm that it is the Legislature’s sole province to waive or abrogate sovereign\n\nimmunity.”). Thus, it is the Legislature’s function to determine what steps a litigant must take before\n\nthe state’s immunity is waived. See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 253 S.W.3d 653,\n\n660 (Tex. 2008) (“[T]he Legislature . . . has consented to suits brought under the TCHRA, provided\n\nthe procedures outlined in the statute have been met.”). Although section 311.034’s scope is fairly\n\nsweeping, it is consistent with the purpose of sovereign immunity and within the Legislature’s\n\ndiscretion to determine the procedures required before the State’s immunity is waived.\n\n         Having construed the meaning of the term “statutory prerequisite,” we turn to whether\n\nChatha’s failure to comply with the requirements of section 21.202 is a jurisdictional bar to her suit\n\nagainst the University. As mentioned, section 21.202 provides:\n\n         (a)      A complaint under this subchapter must be filed not later than the 180th day\n                  after the date the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\n\n         (b)      The [TWC] shall dismiss an untimely complaint.\n\nTEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202.\n\n         Since the 2005 amendment to section 311.034, three courts of appeals have specifically\n\naddressed whether the 180-day filing deadline in the TCHRA is a statutory prerequisite to suit as\n\ncontemplated by section 311.034. All three concluded that it is.18 We agree.\n\n\n         18\n            Comptroller v. Landsfeld, 352 S.W .3d 171, 177–78 (Tex. App.— Fort W orth 2011, pet. denied); Lamar Univ.\nv. Jordan, No. 09-10-00292-CV, 2011 W L 550089, at *5 (Tex. App.— Beaumont Feb. 17, 2011, no pet.) (stating that\n“[t]he Labor Code filing deadlines are jurisdictional in cases involving statutory requirements relating to governmental\nentities”); Tex. Dep’t. of Health v. Neal, No. 03-09-00574-CV, 2011 W L 1744966, at *3 (Tex. App.–Austin May 6,\n2011, no pet.) (reasoning that the waiver of sovereign immunity under the TCHRA applies “only if the claimant strictly\nsatisfies the procedural requirements outlined in Chapter 21”).\n\n                                                          20\n\f        We have repeatedly affirmed that any purported statutory waiver of sovereign immunity\n\nshould be strictly construed in favor of retention of immunity. See, e.g., Wichita Falls State Hosp.\n\nv. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692, 696 (Tex. 2003). Although our precedent establishes that the TCHRA\n\nclearly and unambiguously waives sovereign immunity, it is a limited waiver of immunity. See\n\nMission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 253 S.W.3d at 660. The TCHRA is a statutory cause of action\n\nwith no remedy at common law. As we have recently stated, it does not create subject matter\n\njurisdiction in Texas courts; rather, a claimant can bring suit under the TCHRA against a\n\ngovernmental entity only after a claimant strictly satisfies the procedural requirements outlined in\n\nthe TCHRA. Id. (“[T]he Legislature . . . has consented to suits brought under the TCHRA, provided\n\nthe procedures outlined in the statute have been met.”). In sum, we hold that section 21.202’s\n\nadministrative filing requirement is a mandatory statutory requirement that must be complied with\n\nbefore filing suit, and, as such, is a statutory prerequisite under section 311.034. Because Chatha\n\nfailed to timely file her complaint with the TWC in accordance with the requirements of section\n\n21.202, her suit against the University is jurisdictionally barred.\n\n                                     2. Response to the Dissent\n\n        Ignoring the plain language of section 311.034 and the Legislature’s unequivocal abrogation\n\nof our decision in Loutzenhiser, the dissent posits that the failure to timely file a complaint with the\n\nTWC within 180 days is not a statutory prerequisite to suit. To support its argument, the dissent first\n\nattempts to draw a distinction based on whether the Legislature has specifically articulated that the\n\npre-suit task must be accomplished before filing suit. This is a distinction without a difference. It\n\nis the Legislature that establishes the timeline for filing suit and the mandatory tasks that must be\n\n                                                  21\n\fcompleted before filing; a statutory provision that is mandatory and must be complied with before\n\nfiling suit is sufficient to fall within the ambit of section 311.034. The dissent’s suggestion that the\n\nLegislature must specifically articulate in every instance that the plaintiff must comply with a\n\nprovision or be barred from filing suit not only inexplicably constrains the plain language of section\n\n311.034, but also renders the 2005 amendment to that statute meaningless. See Presidio Indep. Sch.\n\nDist. v. Scott, 309 S.W.3d 927, 931 (Tex. 2010).\n\n         Moreover, the dissent’s argument mirrors the rationale we used in Loutzenhiser, where we\n\nreasoned that because the pre-suit notice provision was “not a condition of the Tort Claims Act’s\n\nwaiver of immunity as other provisions are,” the failure to provide it did not deprive the court of\n\njurisdiction. 140 S.W.3d at 365. But the dissent’s analysis is flawed. The 2005 amendment to\n\nsection 311.034 expressly rejected this reasoning, and in turn made notice, along with other statutory\n\nprerequisites, conditions of a statute’s waiver of immunity. We can find no logical basis for\n\nconcluding, as our dissenting colleagues do, that pre-suit notice is different from any other\n\nmandatory statutory prerequisites provided by the Legislature, such as the pre-suit administrative\n\nfiling requirement at issue here. Following the 2005 amendment to section 311.034, we concluded\n\nthat mandatory pre-suit notice to a governmental defendant is a statutory prerequisite, whether or not\n\nthe Legislature has specifically mandated that a plaintiff may not file suit until providing notice. See\n\nArancibia, 324 S.W.3d at 547. We acknowledge that some courts of appeals have carved out\n\nspecific provisions, such as certain filing deadlines, as non-jurisdictional.19 But we agree with the\n\n        19\n            See, e.g., Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice v. Guard, No. 10-06-00065-CV, 2007 W L 1119572, at *3 (Tex.\nApp.–W aco 2007, no pet.) (“[A] filing period is not an act that must be performed prior to filing suit and so is not a\nstatutory prerequisite.”).\n\n                                                          22\n\fother courts of appeals that have relied on our holdings in In re United Services Automobile Ass’n\n\nand Mission Consolidated Independent School District20 for the proposition that a mandatory\n\nstatutory provision is a statutory prerequisite under section 311.034, provided it is to be complied\n\nwith prior to filing suit.21 Under section 311.034, a statutory requirement commanding action before\n\nfiling suit is a statutory prerequisite. See, e.g., In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307 S.W.3d at 299.\n\nThus, a statutory prerequisite to suit, whether administrative (such as filing a charge of\n\ndiscrimination) or procedural (such as timely filing a lawsuit) is jurisdictional when the defendant\n\nis a governmental entity. See TEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM . CODE § 311.034.\n\n         The dissent worries that under our holding, equitable defenses could potentially be urged\n\nagainst private employers but not governmental entities. However, the dissent’s position invades\n\nthe domain of the Legislature and cuts against the very nature of sovereign immunity. Because a\n\ngovernmental entity may challenge the denial of a plea to the jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal,\n\nTEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM . CODE § 51.014, the entity may effectively avoid the time and expense of\n\nlitigating the merits of a case by first raising the statutory prerequisite issue under section 311.034.\n\n\n\n\n         20\n             In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307 S.W .3d at 310 (“W hile the Legislature could make the Labor Code filing\ndeadlines jurisdictional, as it has in cases involving statutory requirements relating to governmental entities, see T EX .\nG O V ’T C O D E § 311.034 (providing that ‘statutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\njurisdictional requirements in all suits against a governmental entity’), it has not done so here.”); Mission Consol. Indep.\nSch. Dist., 253 S.W .3d at 660 (“The Legislature . . . has consented to suits brought under the TCHRA, provided the\nprocedures outlined in the statute have been met.”).\n\n         21\n           See, e.g., Jones v. State Bd. of Educator Certification, 315 S.W .3d 237, 240 (Tex. App.–Austin 2010, pet.\ndenied) (stating that, “[i]n suits against governmental entities, a timely filed petition for judicial review is a statutory\nprerequisite to suit, so that failure to comply deprives the trial court of jurisdiction”); El Paso Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Alspini,\n315 S.W .3d 144, 151 (Tex. App.–El Paso 2010, no pet.) (holding that the two-year limitations deadline to file suit under\nthe TCHRA is a statutory prerequisite contemplated by section 311.034).\n\n                                                               23\n\fThe potential absence of equitable defenses against governmental entities that retain their immunity\n\nis sovereign immunity’s most basic tenet.\n\n       Finally, the dissent relies on the contrast between Title VII and the TCHRA, oddly suggesting\n\nthat procedural differences under the two statutes would impose an unworkable dichotomy. The\n\ndissent suggests that equitable defenses will be available under Title VII, but not under the TCHRA\n\nwhen a claimant files an untimely complaint against a governmental entity. But given the 2005\n\namendment to section 311.034, looking to federal case law for guidance in determining the\n\njurisdictional nature of the TCHRA’s 180-day filing deadline is inappropriate when a claimant files\n\nsuit against a governmental entity. Although we look to federal law for guidance in situations where\n\nthe TCHRA and Title VII contain analogous statutory language, see, e.g., In re United Servs. Auto.\n\nAss’n, 307 S.W.3d at 308, that is not the case here. Congress has not enacted a provision comparable\n\nto section 311.034. Thus, we do not look to federal case law for guidance, as it would provide none.\n\n       In sum, the dissent’s approach wholly ignores the Legislature’s straightforward mandate that\n\nin suits against the government, statutory prerequisites are jurisdictional. The Legislature has made\n\nclear that the failure to file an administrative complaint within 180 days of the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment discrimination by a governmental entity is a jurisdictional bar because it is a statutory\n\nprerequisite to suit under section 311.034 of the Government Code. Thus, because Chatha failed to\n\nfile her complaint with the TWC within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice\n\noccurred, the University properly asserted a plea to the jurisdiction, and the plea should have been\n\ngranted. See TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202(a) (“A complaint under this subchapter must be filed not\n\nlater than the 180th day after the date the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.”).\n\n                                                 24\n\f                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n        It does not escape our attention that it may be difficult for employees to discover\n\ndiscriminatory policies because of the secrecy of compensation decisions. Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at\n\n645, 649–50 (Ginsberg, J., dissenting). Moreover, we recognize the potential difficulty facing\n\nemployers and employees in having the 180-day limitations period for filing a pay discrimination\n\ncomplaint accrue at different times under Title VII and the TCHRA. But we are not the law-making\n\nbody. We are called to interpret and apply the law as it is enacted by the Legislature. Our precedent\n\nestablishes that the 180-day limitations period in the TCHRA begins “when the employee is\n\ninformed of the allegedly discriminatory employment decision, not when that decision comes to\n\nfruition.” Specialty Retailers, 933 S.W.2d at 493. Congress has created an exception in the\n\nLedbetter Act for pay discrimination claims brought under Title VII; the Texas Legislature has not.\n\nWe decline to adopt federal statutory language that the Legislature has failed to similarly enact into\n\nstate law. We therefore reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment dismissing the\n\nsuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      ____________________________________\n                                                      Eva M.

At issue here is section 21.202 of the TCHRA, which obligates a claimant to file a complaint\n\nwith the Texas Workforce Commission civil rights division (TWC) or the Equal Employment\n\n\n        1\n          As we have previously observed, courts refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the Texas Commission on\nHuman Rights Act. Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams, 313 S.W .3d 796, 798 n.1 (Tex. 2010). However, the Commission\non Human Rights has been replaced with the Texas W orkforce Commission civil rights division. Id. Throughout this\nopinion, we refer to Chapter 21 of the Labor Code as the TCHRA.\n\n        2\n            Title VII is codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.\n\fOpportunity Commission (EEOC) not later than the 180th day after the date an allegedly unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurs. The term “occur” is not defined in the TCHRA, but we have\n\npreviously interpreted it to mean when a discriminatory employment decision is made—not when\n\nthe effects of that decision become manifest in later events. Our interpretation mirrored the United\n\nStates Supreme Court’s interpretation of Title VII until recently. But, in 2009, Congress enacted the\n\nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (Ledbetter Act), amending Title VII to provide that a discriminatory pay\n\ndecision occurs each time a paycheck is received and not just when an initial salary decision is\n\nmade.3 Thus, when a claimant files a discriminatory pay claim under federal law, the 180-day\n\nlimitations period begins each time a claimant receives a paycheck containing a discriminatory\n\namount. The Texas Legislature has not similarly amended the TCHRA.\n\n       As a matter of first impression, we must determine whether the federal Ledbetter Act applies\n\nto a claim brought under the TCHRA so that the 180-day limitations period begins anew each time\n\na claimant receives a paycheck containing a discriminatory amount. Because Title VII and the\n\nTCHRA are no longer analogous where discriminatory pay claims are concerned, and because the\n\nLegislature—and not this Court—is the proper governmental branch to amend the TCHRA, we hold\n\nthat the federal Ledbetter Act does not apply to a claim brought under the TCHRA. Thus, in\n\naccordance with the TCHRA and our precedent, we conclude that a pay discrimination complaint\n\nmust generally be brought within 180 days of the date the claimant is informed of the compensation\n\ndecision. We further hold that the 180-day filing requirement is a mandatory statutory requirement\n\n\n\n       3\n           See Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111–2, 123 Stat. 5.\n\n                                                          2\n\fthat must be complied with before filing suit, and, as such, is a statutory prerequisite to suit under\n\nsection 311.034 of the Government Code. Because the claimant here failed to timely file her\n\ncomplaint with the TWC, we conclude that her suit is jurisdictionally barred by section 311.034. We\n\ntherefore reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment dismissing the suit.\n\n                                   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n         Respondent Dr. Diljit K. Chatha is a professor at Prairie View A&M University (the\n\nUniversity). Chatha began employment at the University in 1987 and applied for a promotion from\n\nassociate professor to full professor in 2003. She was initially denied the promotion but received\n\nit in 2004. At that time, she complained to the University that her salary was inequitable but was\n\ntold there were no funds available for a salary adjustment. About two years after her promotion,\n\nChatha filed a complaint with the EEOC and the TWC, alleging race and nationality-based pay\n\ndiscrimination. Chatha is of Indian national origin. In her complaint, Chatha marked the\n\n“continuing action” box, alleging discrimination between September 1, 2005 and September 26,\n\n2005.4 After receiving right-to-sue notices from the EEOC and the TWC, Chatha filed suit against\n\nthe University in state court under the TCHRA. The University responded by filing a plea to the\n\njurisdiction, asserting Chatha’s TWC complaint was untimely filed pursuant to the 180-day\n\n\n\n         4\n            A claimant may file a complaint with either the EEOC, the federal agency authorized to investigate charges\nof discrimination, or the TW C, the Texas equivalent. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); T EX . L AB . C O DE §§ 21.201, .202;\n40 T EX . A DM IN . C OD E . § 819.41(c). If a state has its own employment discrimination laws, as Texas does, Title VII\nrequires the EEOC to defer charges of discrimination it receives from employees in those states to state or local fair\nemployment practices agencies for at least sixty days, in this case the TW C, so that attempts to resolve disputes can first\nbe undertaken under state law. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(c); see Schroeder v. Tex. Iron Works, Inc., 813 S.W .2d 483, 485\n(Tex. 1991) (overruled on other grounds by In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307 S.W .3d 299, 310 (Tex. 2010)). Thus,\ncharges that are filed by Texas employees with the EEOC are contemporaneously filed with the TW C. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5(d).\n\n                                                             3\n\flimitations period under the TCHRA. See TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202. The University specifically\n\nalleged that Chatha was aware of the alleged discriminatory salary in 2004, yet failed to file a\n\ncomplaint until 2006. Chatha responded that the federal Ledbetter Act applies to a discriminatory\n\npay claim brought under the TCHRA because one of the TCHRA’s purposes is to execute the\n\npolicies of Title VII. See id. § 21.001(1). The trial court denied the University’s plea.\n\n         The University brought an interlocutory appeal, see TEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM . CODE\n\n§ 51.014(a)(8), and the court of appeals affirmed, holding that the Ledbetter Act applies to claims\n\nbrought under the TCHRA, and Chatha’s claim was therefore timely because she received a\n\npaycheck containing an alleged discriminatory amount within 180 days of the date she filed her\n\ncomplaint with the TWC. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404, 407. In reaching this decision, the court of appeals\n\nrelied on (1) the general purposes provision of the TCHRA, and (2) two federal district court\n\ndecisions that had applied the Ledbetter Act to the TCHRA. Id. at 407.

Analysis\n\n                                               A. Legal Framework\n\n         The TCHRA was “enacted to address the specific evil of discrimination and retaliation in the\n\nworkplace,” as well as to coordinate and conform with federal anti-discrimination and retaliation\n\nlaws under Title VII. See City of Waco v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895021\"><a href=\"/opinion/895021/city-of-waco-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153–55 (Tex. 2008). Although\n\nfrom its inception the TCHRA was not an exact replica of Title VII, both the TCHRA and Title VII\n\nsimilarly define unlawful employment practice,6 and as part of each act’s administrative process\n\nimpose a strict 180-day statute of limitations for filing an employment discrimination complaint with\n\nthe appropriate governmental agency, running from the date the alleged unlawful employment\n\npractice occurs. The TCHRA provides:\n\n         (a)       A complaint under this subchapter must be filed not later than the 180th day\n                   after the date the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\n\n         (b)       The [TWC] shall dismiss an untimely complaint.\n\nTEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202.7 Prior to the federal Ledbetter Act’s enactment in 2009, Title VII and the\n\nTCHRA contained virtually identical language concerning the 180-day limitations period.\n\n\n\n         6\n           Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.”), with T EX .

Central Power & Light Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746112\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746112/caballero-v-central-power-and-light-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n359–61 (Tex. 1993), we have looked to federal law for guidance in situations where the TCHRA and\n\nTitle VII contain analogous statutory language, see, e.g., Specialty Retailers v.

Therefore, we previously looked to federal case law in\n\ninterpreting the 180-day limitations provision in section 21.202 for defining when an unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurs. See id. In Speciality Retailers, we held that the 180-day limitations\n\nperiod in the TCHRA commences “when the employee is informed of the allegedly discriminatory\n\nemployment decision, not when that decision comes to fruition.” Id. at 493. There, an employee\n\nwas informed that she would be fired if her leave of absence lasted longer than one year. Id. at 492.\n\nWhen the employee did not return to work after a year, her employment was terminated. Id. We\n\nconcluded that the 180-day limitations period began when the employee was informed of the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory policy, not when her employment was actually terminated a year later. Id. at 493.\n\nWe noted a distinction between an act of continuing discrimination and an effect of past\n\ndiscrimination, and determined that the termination of her employment after a year’s leave of\n\nabsence could only be considered an effect of past discrimination.

In Ricks, a professor was denied tenure, and in accordance with the university’s\n\npolicy regarding unsuccessful tenure applicants, Ricks was instead offered a “terminal” one year\n\ncontract. 449 U.S. at 253. Two months before his termination, Ricks filed an EEOC complaint\n\n                                                  6\n\falleging employment discrimination. Id. at 254. The Supreme Court held that Ricks’s complaint\n\nwas barred because it was filed more than 180 days after he was notified of the Board’s decision to\n\ndeny tenure. Id. at 257–58. It was the denial of tenure that constituted the allegedly discriminatory\n\nemployment decision, not the actual termination one year later. Id. at 258. The Supreme Court\n\nnoted that it is possible for the effects of a discriminatory employment practice to be most painful\n\nat a time far removed from the discriminatory decision itself, but, nonetheless, the discriminatory\n\nact occurs when the discriminatory decision is made.

The Court reasoned that the claimant could not shift the\n\ndiscriminatory intent from the initial salary decision to her paychecks, which were issued without\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Id. at 629.

Thus, the Ledbetter Act expanded the Title VII\n\nlimitations period to allow an employee complaining of pay discrimination to file a complaint within\n\n180 days after the receipt of any allegedly discriminatory paycheck.\n\n       The Texas Legislature has not similarly amended the TCHRA. Since the Ledbetter Act was\n\nenacted in 2009, the Legislature has twice considered but failed to enact proposed legislation\n\nconforming the TCHRA to Title VII in determining when an unlawful employment practice occurs\n\nin pay discrimination claims.9 Thus, under the TCHRA, the term “occur” is still statutorily\n\nundefined, and the controlling authority for interpreting when an unlawful employment practice\n\noccurs remains our holding in Speciality Retailers.\n\n       Chatha argues that we should nonetheless interpret the TCHRA as incorporating the\n\nLedbetter Act’s amendments to Title VII. Chatha primarily relies on the general purposes provision\n\nof the TCHRA, which specifies a purpose of executing the policies of Title VII. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE § 21.001(1). Chatha contends that, relying on this provision, we have frequently looked to\n\n\n\n       9\n           See Tex. S.B. 280, 82d Leg., R.S. (2011); Tex. S.B. 986, 81st Leg., R.S. (2009).\n\n                                                          8\n\ffederal law in interpreting the TCHRA, and should do so here as well. The University counters that\n\nthis Court has only looked to federal law for guidance in circumstances where Title VII and the\n\nTCHRA are analogous and that they are no longer analogous after the Ledbetter Act. We agree with\n\nthe University.\n\n                  B. The TCHRA Does Not Incorporate the Ledbetter Act\n\n       The general purposes provision of the TCHRA states that one of its purposes is to “provide\n\nfor the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent\n\namendments.” Id. We have cited this provision when looking to federal law in interpreting the\n\nTCHRA, and have specifically stated that we should correlate the TCHRA with Title VII when\n\npossible. See, e.g., AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895070\"><a href=\"/opinion/895070/autozone-inc-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 592 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam). But we\n\nhave never said that the general purposes provision requires the TCHRA to forever remain identical\n\nto Title VII, regardless of subsequent congressional amendments to the federal act. Rather, we\n\nconsider the plain terms of the TCHRA and our precedent, and look to federal law for guidance only\n\nwhen the relevant provisions of Title VII are analogous. See In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895210\"><a href=\"/opinion/895210/in-re-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (Tex. 2010). Here, although the TCHRA and Title VII were previously analogous\n\nregarding when an unlawful employment practice occurs, after the Ledbetter Act, this is no longer\n\ntrue where pay discrimination complaints are concerned. Although Chatha invites us to read the\n\ngeneral purposes provision as requiring the incorporation of subsequent amendments made to Title\n\nVII into the TCHRA, we decline to do so for several reasons.\n\n       First, the TCHRA’s plain language does not evidence a legislative intent that Title VII\n\namendments should be automatically incorporated into its provisions. The plain language of a\n\n                                                9\n\fstatute is the surest guide to the Legislature’s intent. See City of DeSoto v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895132\"><a href=\"/opinion/895132/city-of-desoto-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n394 (Tex. 2009). The general purposes provision merely states that the TCHRA’s purpose is to\n\nprovide for the execution of policies embodied in Title VII “and its subsequent amendments.” TEX .\n\nLAB. CODE § 21.001(1). The reference to subsequent Title VII amendments means only that one of\n\nthe TCHRA’s purposes is to execute policies of Title VII as it may be amended, not that those\n\namendments should be automatically incorporated into Texas law. See Fogle v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393650\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393650/fogle-v-southwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (W.D. Tex. 1992). Indeed, in enacting the TCHRA in 1983, the Legislature\n\ncould not have foreseen every possible Title VII amendment going forward, and there is no\n\nindication the Legislature intended to automatically adopt every conceivable Title VII amendment,\n\nhowever substantive and far-reaching, into the TCHRA.\n\n       Second, the TCHRA is not identical to Title VII and the Legislature has not indicated an\n\nintent to make it so. For example, the TCHRA requires a plaintiff to file suit within two years after\n\na plaintiff files a charge of discrimination while Title VII lacks this requirement. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE § 21.256. Further, the TCHRA requires a plaintiff to file suit within sixty days of receiving\n\na right-to-sue letter whereas Title VII imposes a deadline of ninety days. Compare id. § 21.254, with\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). Had the Legislature intended the provisions of the TCHRA and Title VII\n\nto be identical, it could have conformed these nonanalogous provisions.\n\n       Finally, the Legislature has never treated the general purposes provision as automatically\n\nincorporating amendments made to Title VII into the TCHRA, but has instead acted legislatively\n\nwhen it wishes to conform the TCHRA to Title VII. One example is when, similar to the Ledbetter\n\nAct, Congress abrogated Supreme Court precedent in the context of discriminatory seniority systems.\n\n                                                 10\n\fIn 1989, the Supreme Court held that complaints regarding a discriminatory seniority system must\n\nbe brought within 180 days after the adoption of the system, not when employees experience the\n\nadverse effects of that system. Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112282\"><a href=\"/opinion/112282/lorance-v-att-technologies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 907–08 (1989). After\n\nLorance, Congress amended Title VII to allow liability from an intentionally discriminatory seniority\n\nsystem not only at the time of its adoption but also at the time of its application. See Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1072, 1078–79.10 After Congress enacted this\n\namendment, the Texas Legislature followed suit by amending the TCHRA to conform it to the new\n\nfederal amendments concerning seniority systems.11 TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.127. If the general\n\npurposes provision automatically incorporated amendments made to Title VII, subsequent\n\nenactments by the Legislature would have been wholly unnecessary.\n\n        Nonetheless, Chatha points to our decision in Caballero as support for her assertion that this\n\nCourt has previously interpreted the general purposes provision to incorporate Title VII provisions\n\ninto the TCHRA. But Caballero does not support this proposition. There, we considered whether\n\na litigant who is authorized to proceed in court under the TCHRA is entitled to a jury trial on\n\ndamages. Caballero, 858 S.W.2d at 359. An employee filed suit against his employer for\n\ndiscrimination and, after a jury trial favorable to the employee, the trial court entered judgment\n\npermitting recovery of monetary damages. Id. The court of appeals, however, concluded that\n\n\n\n        10\n         The Ledbetter Act parallels the language of this amendment with respect to pay discrimination claims.\nCompare 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e)(2), with 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e)(3)(A).\n\n        11\n          Similarly, the Legislature acted in 2009 to amend the TCHRA following congressional amendments to the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Compare ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553,\n3555–58, with Act of May 27, 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., ch. 337, §§ 2–5, 2009 Tex. Gen. Laws 868, 869–70.\n\n                                                      11\n\fbecause the TCHRA is substantially an equitable statute, an employee was first required to obtain\n\nan injunction against his employer’s conduct before being entitled to a jury trial. Id. We reversed,\n\nconcluding that the court of appeals’ reading of the relevant statutes erroneously turned a permissive\n\nprocedure into a mandatory one, and the effect of that reading was inconsistent with the TCHRA as\n\na whole. Id. at 359–60. We further observed that our construction of the relevant statutes was\n\nconsistent with our precedent in injunction proceedings. Id. at 361. Only then did we note that one\n\nstated purpose of the TCHRA is to coordinate and conform TCHRA with Title VII, id., and that\n\nCongress had recently amended Title VII to clarify that a party seeking compensatory or punitive\n\ndamages may demand a jury trial, id. n.4. Thus, we looked to the plain terms of the TCHRA and\n\nrelevant Texas case law in reaching our holding and merely observed that our holding was in line\n\nwith recent amendments to Title VII.\n\n       Finally, Chatha points to two federal district court decisions that predicted Texas courts\n\nwould abandon prior precedent and follow the Ledbetter Act in deciding when a discriminatory pay\n\ndecision occurs under the TCHRA.

(Klebe II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2506014\"><a href=\"/opinion/2506014/klebe-v-university-of-texas-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Klebe II stated that the Ledbetter Act simply supplied a missing definition of the term\n\n“occurred” that was absent from prior law. See 649 F. Supp. 2d at 571. Thus, the Klebe II court\n\nsuggested that if the TCHRA and Title VII are expressly different, courts should follow state law,\n\nbut if the TCHRA is silent—such as on the meaning of “occur”—courts should follow the now-\n\ndefined meaning of “occur” in Title VII. See id.\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f       We respectfully disagree that when Congress enacted the Ledbetter Act, it merely supplied\n\na missing definition. Rather, by amendment, it carved out an exception for pay discrimination claims\n\nto the already well-settled Ricks test for when an unlawful employment practice occurs. And while\n\nit is true that the TCHRA—like Title VII before the Ledbetter Act—is statutorily silent as to the\n\ndefinition of “occur,” we have previously held that an unlawful employment practice occurs when\n\nthe employee is informed of the allegedly discriminatory employment decision. See Specialty\n\nRetailers, 933 S.W.2d at 493. But, unlike Congress, the Texas Legislature has not crafted an\n\nexception to this rule for pay discrimination claims. As we have explained, it is the province of the\n\nLegislature to determine whether to enact an exception similar to the Ledbetter Act in the context\n\nof pay discrimination claims under the TCHRA. For this Court to apply a nonanalogous federal\n\nstatute like the Ledbetter Act in the absence of legislative action would require us to abdicate our\n\nrole as interpreters of the law in favor of a lawmaking function. We decline to take that role.\n\n                  C. The TCHRA Bars Chatha’s Pay Discrimination Claims\n\n       Having concluded that the Ledbetter Act does not apply to Chatha’s claims, we next\n\ndetermine whether Chatha’s complaint was untimely filed under the TCHRA. Chatha does not argue\n\nher claims are timely if we conclude the Ledbetter Act does not apply. Nonetheless, because we\n\nhave never directly addressed when a pay discrimination complaint must be filed under the TCHRA,\n\nwe consider whether Chatha’s complaint was untimely. Because the TCHRA and Title VII are no\n\nlonger analogous as to when a discriminatory pay practice occurs, we look solely to our precedent\n\nin making this determination. In Speciality Retailers, we held that the 180-day limitations period\n\nin the TCHRA begins “when the employee is informed of the allegedly discriminatory employment\n\n                                                 13\n\fdecision, not when that decision comes to fruition.” 933 S.W.2d at 493. This is because the\n\ndiscriminatory employment decision is the practice made with discriminatory intent. Our rule\n\napplies with equal force in the context of pay discrimination decisions.

Subsequent\n\npaychecks containing an alleged discriminatory pay amount are merely consequences of past\n\ndiscrimination and do not constitute an unlawful employment practice under the TCHRA. Thus, an\n\nemployee must file a complaint under th e TCHRA within 180 days of the date she is informed of\n\nthe alleged discriminatory pay decision.13 Here, Chatha was informed of the alleged discriminatory\n\npay decision when she was promoted to full professor in 2004, yet she did not file a complaint with\n\nthe TWC or the EEOC until 2006.14 Thus, Chatha’s complaint was untimely filed under section\n\n21.202. See TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202.\n\n\n\n         12\n            The court of appeals here acknowledged that if the Ledbetter Act did not apply, each new paycheck would\nnot constitute a new occurrence and Chatha’s complaint would be untimely. 317 S.W .3d at 406.\n\n         13\n           W e note that a situation could arise where an employer has adopted a facially discriminatory payment system\nthat would potentially constitute an act of intentional discrimination anytime the employer issued a check to a disfavored\nemployee. See Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 634; Cooper-Day, 121 S.W .3d at 84. However, neither party alleges that situation\napplies here.\n\n         14\n             Chatha’s complaint of discrimination states that the last day of discrimination was in September 2005.\nHowever, even accepting this as true, her complaint was still filed outside of the 180-day limitations period because she\ndid not file her complaint until September 2006.\n\n                                                           14\n\f                                D. The University’s Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n         Having concluded that Chatha’s complaint was untimely filed under the TCHRA, we next\n\ndetermine whether that failure is a jurisdictional bar to suit. At the trial court, the University filed\n\na combined motion for summary judgment and plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that because Chatha\n\nfailed to comply with section 21.202, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the suit. The Legislature\n\nhas mandated that all statutory prerequisites to suit are jurisdictional in suits against governmental\n\nentities. TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 311.034. Here, it is undisputed that compliance with section 21.202\n\nis mandatory and that the University timely raised Chatha’s failure to comply at the trial court. Thus,\n\nas we will explain below, we conclude that because the University is a governmental entity, and\n\ncompliance with section 21.202 is a statutory prerequisite to suit under Texas Government Code\n\nsection 311.034, the University’s plea should have been granted and the case dismissed.15\n\n                              1. Statutory Prerequisite to Suit Under Section\n                                  311.034 of the Texas Government Code\n\n         Since the Legislature amended section 311.034 of the Government Code in 2005, we have\n\nnot construed its reach. Because there is some confusion among the courts of appeals about section\n\n311.034’s scope, we deem it prudent to review the jurisprudential context from which the statute was\n\namended.\n\n         For decades, Texas courts followed the rule we announced in Mingus v. Wadley, establishing\n\nthat when a cause of action is derived from statute, strict compliance with all statutory prerequisites\n\n\n\n         15\n            Because we conclude section 21.202 is a statutory prerequisite to suit under section 311.034, and is thus a\njurisdictional requirement under that section, we need not decide whether section 21.202 itself is jurisdictional in nature.\n\n\n\n                                                            15\n\fis necessary to vest a trial court with jurisdiction. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3956985\"><a href=\"/opinion/4187605/mingus-receiver-v-wadley/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1087 (Tex. 1926).

First, it is of obvious mention that\n\nin order to fall within the ambit of section 311.034, a prerequisite must be found in the relevant\n\n                                                  17\n\fstatutory language.

Second, the prerequisite must be a\n\nrequirement.16 And finally, the term “pre” indicates the requirement must be met before the lawsuit\n\nis filed. See Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541563/roccaforte-v-jefferson-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 925 (Tex. 2011) (holding that post-suit\n\nnotice requirement was not jurisdictional, even in light of section 311.034, because post-suit notice\n\nis not a “prerequisite” to suit). Thus, according to the plain language of section 311.034, the term\n\n“statutory prerequisite” refers to statutory provisions that are mandatory and must be accomplished\n\nprior to filing suit.\n\n        This interpretation is supported by the particular meaning the term “statutory prerequisite”\n\nhas acquired in our precedent. In drafting section 311.034, the Legislature took special care to use\n\nthe term we articulated in Dubai. While in Mingus we held that all “statutory provisions are\n\nmandatory and exclusive,” 285 S.W. at 1087, in Dubai we “overrule[d] Mingus to the extent that it\n\ncharacterized the plaintiff’s failure to establish a statutory prerequisite as jurisdictional,” 12 S.W.3d\n\nat 76 (emphasis added). With the 2005 amendment to section 311.034—that statutory prerequisites\n\nare jurisdictional in all suits against a governmental entity—the Legislature effectively abrogated our\n\nholding in Loutzenhiser and reverted to our broader holding in Mingus in suits against a\n\ngovernmental entity. See Mingus, 285 S.W. at 1087 (concluding that in suits against a governmental\n\n\n        16\n             The common meaning of the word requisite is “essential,” “necessary.” W EBSTER ’S N EW C O LLEGIA TE\nD IC TIO N ARY 976 (1980).\n\n                                                       18\n\fentity, “where the cause of action and remedy for its enforcement are derived not from the common\n\nlaw but from statute, the statutory provisions are mandatory and exclusive, and must be complied\n\nwith in all respects or the action is not maintainable”). The Legislature’s mandate is clear: In a\n\nstatutory cause of action against a governmental entity, the failure to adhere to the statute’s\n\nmandatory provisions that must be accomplished before filing suit is a jurisdictional bar to suit.17\n\n         Our interpretation is consistent with the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Sovereign\n\nimmunity bars suits against the state and its entities, and this immunity remains intact unless\n\nsurrendered in express and unequivocal terms by the statute’s clear and unambiguous waiver.

Although our precedent establishes that the TCHRA\n\nclearly and unambiguously waives sovereign immunity, it is a limited waiver of immunity. See\n\nMission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 253 S.W.3d at 660. The TCHRA is a statutory cause of action\n\nwith no remedy at common law. As we have recently stated, it does not create subject matter\n\njurisdiction in Texas courts; rather, a claimant can bring suit under the TCHRA against a\n\ngovernmental entity only after a claimant strictly satisfies the procedural requirements outlined in\n\nthe TCHRA. Id. (“[T]he Legislature . . . has consented to suits brought under the TCHRA, provided\n\nthe procedures outlined in the statute have been met.”). In sum, we hold that section 21.202’s\n\nadministrative filing requirement is a mandatory statutory requirement that must be complied with\n\nbefore filing suit, and, as such, is a statutory prerequisite under section 311.034. Because Chatha\n\nfailed to timely file her complaint with the TWC in accordance with the requirements of section\n\n21.202, her suit against the University is jurisdictionally barred.\n\n                                     2. Response to the Dissent\n\n        Ignoring the plain language of section 311.034 and the Legislature’s unequivocal abrogation\n\nof our decision in Loutzenhiser, the dissent posits that the failure to timely file a complaint with the\n\nTWC within 180 days is not a statutory prerequisite to suit. To support its argument, the dissent first\n\nattempts to draw a distinction based on whether the Legislature has specifically articulated that the\n\npre-suit task must be accomplished before filing suit. This is a distinction without a difference. It\n\nis the Legislature that establishes the timeline for filing suit and the mandatory tasks that must be\n\n                                                  21\n\fcompleted before filing; a statutory provision that is mandatory and must be complied with before\n\nfiling suit is sufficient to fall within the ambit of section 311.034. The dissent’s suggestion that the\n\nLegislature must specifically articulate in every instance that the plaintiff must comply with a\n\nprovision or be barred from filing suit not only inexplicably constrains the plain language of section\n\n311.034, but also renders the 2005 amendment to that statute meaningless. See Presidio Indep. Sch.\n\nDist. v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895219\"><a href=\"/opinion/895219/presidio-independent-school-dist-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931 (Tex. 2010).\n\n         Moreover, the dissent’s argument mirrors the rationale we used in Loutzenhiser, where we\n\nreasoned that because the pre-suit notice provision was “not a condition of the Tort Claims Act’s\n\nwaiver of immunity as other provisions are,” the failure to provide it did not deprive the court of\n\njurisdiction. 140 S.W.3d at 365. But the dissent’s analysis is flawed. The 2005 amendment to\n\nsection 311.034 expressly rejected this reasoning, and in turn made notice, along with other statutory\n\nprerequisites, conditions of a statute’s waiver of immunity. We can find no logical basis for\n\nconcluding, as our dissenting colleagues do, that pre-suit notice is different from any other\n\nmandatory statutory prerequisites provided by the Legislature, such as the pre-suit administrative\n\nfiling requirement at issue here. Following the 2005 amendment to section 311.034, we concluded\n\nthat mandatory pre-suit notice to a governmental defendant is a statutory prerequisite, whether or not\n\nthe Legislature has specifically mandated that a plaintiff may not file suit until providing notice. See\n\nArancibia, 324 S.W.3d at 547. We acknowledge that some courts of appeals have carved out\n\nspecific provisions, such as certain filing deadlines, as non-jurisdictional.19 But we agree with the\n\n        19\n            See, e.g., Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice v. Guard, No. 10-06-00065-CV, 2007 W L 1119572, at *3 (Tex.\nApp.–W aco 2007, no pet.) (“[A] filing period is not an act that must be performed prior to filing suit and so is not a\nstatutory prerequisite.”).\n\n                                                          22\n\fother courts of appeals that have relied on our holdings in In re United Services Automobile Ass’n\n\nand Mission Consolidated Independent School District20 for the proposition that a mandatory\n\nstatutory provision is a statutory prerequisite under section 311.034, provided it is to be complied\n\nwith prior to filing suit.21 Under section 311.034, a statutory requirement commanding action before\n\nfiling suit is a statutory prerequisite. See, e.g., In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307 S.W.3d at 299.\n\nThus, a statutory prerequisite to suit, whether administrative (such as filing a charge of\n\ndiscrimination) or procedural (such as timely filing a lawsuit) is jurisdictional when the defendant\n\nis a governmental entity. See TEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM . CODE § 311.034.\n\n         The dissent worries that under our holding, equitable defenses could potentially be urged\n\nagainst private employers but not governmental entities. However, the dissent’s position invades\n\nthe domain of the Legislature and cuts against the very nature of sovereign immunity. Because a\n\ngovernmental entity may challenge the denial of a plea to the jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal,\n\nTEX . CIV . PRAC. & REM . CODE § 51.014, the entity may effectively avoid the time and expense of\n\nlitigating the merits of a case by first raising the statutory prerequisite issue under section 311.034.\n\n\n\n\n         20\n             In re United Servs. Auto.

Sch. Dist. v. Alspini,\n315 S.W .3d 144, 151 (Tex. App.–El Paso 2010, no pet.) (holding that the two-year limitations deadline to file suit under\nthe TCHRA is a statutory prerequisite contemplated by section 311.034).\n\n                                                               23\n\fThe potential absence of equitable defenses against governmental entities that retain their immunity\n\nis sovereign immunity’s most basic tenet.\n\n       Finally, the dissent relies on the contrast between Title VII and the TCHRA, oddly suggesting\n\nthat procedural differences under the two statutes would impose an unworkable dichotomy. The\n\ndissent suggests that equitable defenses will be available under Title VII, but not under the TCHRA\n\nwhen a claimant files an untimely complaint against a governmental entity. But given the 2005\n\namendment to section 311.034, looking to federal case law for guidance in determining the\n\njurisdictional nature of the TCHRA’s 180-day filing deadline is inappropriate when a claimant files\n\nsuit against a governmental entity. Although we look to federal law for guidance in situations where\n\nthe TCHRA and Title VII contain analogous statutory language, see, e.g., In re United Servs. Auto.\n\nAss’n, 307 S.W.3d at 308, that is not the case here. Congress has not enacted a provision comparable\n\nto section 311.034. Thus, we do not look to federal case law for guidance, as it would provide none.\n\n       In sum, the dissent’s approach wholly ignores the Legislature’s straightforward mandate that\n\nin suits against the government, statutory prerequisites are jurisdictional. The Legislature has made\n\nclear that the failure to file an administrative complaint within 180 days of the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment discrimination by a governmental entity is a jurisdictional bar because it is a statutory\n\nprerequisite to suit under section 311.034 of the Government Code. Thus, because Chatha failed to\n\nfile her complaint with the TWC within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice\n\noccurred, the University properly asserted a plea to the jurisdiction, and the plea should have been\n\ngranted. See TEX . LAB. CODE § 21.202(a) (“A complaint under this subchapter must be filed not\n\nlater than the 180th day after the date the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.”).\n\n                                                 24\n\f                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n        It does not escape our attention that it may be difficult for employees to discover\n\ndiscriminatory policies because of the secrecy of compensation decisions. Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at\n\n645, 649–50 (Ginsberg, J., dissenting). Moreover, we recognize the potential difficulty facing\n\nemployers and employees in having the 180-day limitations period for filing a pay discrimination\n\ncomplaint accrue at different times under Title VII and the TCHRA. But we are not the law-making\n\nbody. We are called to interpret and apply the law as it is enacted by the Legislature. Our precedent\n\nestablishes that the 180-day limitations period in the TCHRA begins “when the employee is\n\ninformed of the allegedly discriminatory employment decision, not when that decision comes to\n\nfruition.” Specialty Retailers, 933 S.W.2d at 493. Congress has created an exception in the\n\nLedbetter Act for pay discrimination claims brought under Title VII; the Texas Legislature has not.\n\nWe decline to adopt federal statutory language that the Legislature has failed to similarly enact into\n\nstate law.
