California Clean\nEnergy Committee (CCEC), a California nonprofit organization, filed a petition for writ\nof mandate under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fCode, §§ 21050 et seq.) to challenge the City’s certification of its final environmental\nimpact report (final EIR) and approval of the project.1 The City opposed the petition,\nwhich was denied in its entirety by the trial court.\n       CCEC appeals, contending (1) the trial court erred in concluding Gateway II did\nnot conflict with the City’s general plan, (2) the City’s mitigation measures are\ninsufficient to ameliorate the urban decay that will be caused by Gateway II, (3) the City\ndid not give meaningful consideration to feasible project alternatives such as the mixed-\nuse alternative, and (4) the final EIR did not properly identify and analyze potentially\nsignificant energy impacts generated by Gateway II.\n       The City asserts claims regarding conflicts between Gateway II and the general\nplan are not cognizable because CCEC did not comply with the statute of limitations\nimposed by the planning and zoning law (Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.). The City\nadditionally asserts CCEC failed to present the CEQA issues in the trial court or during\nthe administrative process. The City further argues it properly considered each of the\nother issues raised by CCEC but rejected them as it is allowed to do under CEQA. And,\nthe City asserts it committed to implementing mitigation measures sufficient to\nameliorate urban decay expected to result from Gateway II.\n       The City also cross-appeals, contending the trial court erroneously granted\nCCEC’s motion to tax costs. Specifically, the City claims it should have received its\ncosts for helping prepare the administrative record. CCEC responds that a public agency\ncannot recover costs when the CEQA petitioner has elected to prepare the record.\n\n\n\n\n1      Undesignated statutory references are to the Public Resources Code. References\nto guidelines are to those located in California Code of Regulations, title 14, section\n15000 and following (Guidelines). These Guidelines are promulgated by the secretary of\nthe California Resources Agency to implement CEQA requirements. (§ 21083, subd. (e);\nCenter for Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th\n1156, 1161, fn. 1 (Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation).)\n\n                                              2\n\f       We conclude CCEC’s petition in the trial court did not assert a cause of action\narising under the planning and zoning law. Consequently, CCEC has not preserved the\nissue of whether the rezoning of the land for Gateway II conflicts with the City’s\ngeneral plan.2\n       On the merits, we conclude the City’s mitigation measures for alleviating the\nanticipated urban decay in its downtown and at a local shopping mall are inadequate\nunder CEQA. Although one of the five mitigation measures is likely to lessen the effects\nof urban decay, even the City recognizes it alone does not constitute sufficient mitigation.\nThe remaining urban decay mitigation measures are too speculative, vague, or\nnoncommittal to comply with CEQA. As to the City’s consideration of project\nalternatives, we conclude the EIRs did not properly assess the merits of the mixed-use\nalternative. On the issue of energy impacts, we conclude CEQA required the City to\nassess transportation, construction, and operation energy impacts resulting from Gateway\nII. The City’s reliance on the California Building Standards Code (Cal. Code Regs., tit.\n24, part 6) (Building Code) and California Green Building Standards Code (Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 24, part 11) (CALGreen) did not suffice to address issues of transportation,\nconstruction, and operation energy impacts.\n       Our conclusion that the judgment must be reversed obviates our need to consider\nthe City’s issue on cross-appeal, which depends on the City being the prevailing party on\nthe CEQA claims.\n\n\n\n\n2      However, the City’s additional assertions of forfeiture of the CEQA issues are\ntroubling because they are contradicted by the record. In a case in which the appellate\nrecord consists of 18,010 pages, claims regarding failure to assert a point during the EIR\nprocess should be more carefully presented.\n\n                                              3\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n                                 The City’s General Plan\n       The City adopted its general plan in December 2002. In it, the City announced it\nintended “[t]o revitalize the Downtown district as the heart of the city. [¶] With a stock\nof historic buildings that tie the community to its past, Downtown is the center of\ncommunity activity and a primary source of Woodland’s identity. The General Plan\nseeks to preserve Downtown’s central location and its function as a center for community\nactivities by continuing the City’s revitalization efforts and considering the effects of\nother land use decisions on Downtown vitality.”\n                                  The Gateway II Project\n       The first phase of the development (Gateway I) was approved in 2006 and\ninvolved Petrovich’s development of 49 acres of agricultural land for retail and\ncommercial uses on the edge of the City –- near the intersection of Interstate Highway 5\n(I-5) and Yolo County Road 102. Gateway I was completed and began leasing when\nPetrovich submitted a plan to the City for development of the next phase of the project\n(Gateway II). In February 2007, Petrovich filed an application with the City to annex\napproximately 154 acres of farmland to the City and to rezone the acreage from\n“Agricultural” to “General Commercial.”\n                                       The Draft EIR\n       In October 2009, the City issued a notice of preparation that an EIR would be\nprepared for the proposed Gateway II project. A draft EIR was published in April 2010.\nThe draft EIR described the scope of the project as a regional commercial center with\napproximately 808,000 square feet of retail space, 3 hotels with 100 rooms each, a 20,000\nsquare foot sit-down restaurant, 3 fast food restaurants with a cumulative 30,500 square\nfeet of space, an 80,000 square foot auto mall, and 100,000 square feet of office space.\n       The draft EIR studied Gateway II’s anticipated impact on retail in surrounding\nareas. Based on “the super-regional retail center size of Woodland Gateway Phase I and\n\n                                              4\n\fPhase II,” the draft EIR expected the project would “include customers from Woodland,\nDavis, Dixon, North Natomas, Greenbriar Specific Plan area, Colusa County, and\nunincorporated portions of Yolo County (including UC Davis and Winters).” Because\n“the specific tenant mix is unknown,” the draft EIR “evaluate[d] the retail trade area’s\nability to support the overall amount of retail rather than specific classes of retail goods.”\n       The analysis divided its assessment of impacts into “two time periods based on\nprojected market demand.” According to the draft EIR, “The phasing approach allows\nfor the Project to minimize the potential for urban decay. [¶] —- The first time period is\nbased on estimated market demand in 2015. This phase includes the first 295,000 square\nfeet of retail development and half of the auto mall (two dealerships). It is anticipated\nthis first phase will be completed by 2015. [¶] —- The second time period includes the\ncumulative project absorption through 2025. The second phase of development,\nanticipated to be completed no earlier than 2025, will include the remaining 545,000\nsquare feet of retail development, 100,000 square feet of office, hotels, and remaining\nauto dealership site.”\n                                      URBAN DECAY\n       The draft EIR engaged in “an assessment of the potential for the Project to cause\nurban decay.” To this end, the draft EIR explained that “the project must be considered\nin connection with the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future\nprojects. For example, impacts related to the physical deterioration and urban decay of\nDowntown Woodland, East of Downtown, and East of I-5.” The draft EIR noted, “urban\ndecay impacts are cumulative by nature.”\n       The draft EIR concluded Gateway II could threaten the economic health and\nphysical integrity of the City’s downtown in the near term: “Downtown Woodland . . .\ncould be directly vulnerable to a loss of sales and increased vacancies. While Project\ntenants will not compete directly with Downtown retailers, a lack of overall demand for\nadditional retail may make it financially infeasible for public or private investors to make\n\n                                              5\n\fthe needed capital improvements to support additional retail suited for Downtown. The\ndevelopment of [Gateway II] may hinder efforts to revitalize downtown in the short term.\n[¶] Over the long-term however, it is anticipated that downtown could benefit from the\nProject. As envisioned, the Project will accommodate auto dealers currently inhabiting\nkey redevelopment sites in downtown. In addition, the Project has the potential to\nincrease the number of shoppers to Woodland through increased capture of regional sales\nactivity, providing downtown with the opportunity to capture a portion of these additional\nshoppers. Finally, the Project will generate additional General Fund revenues to support\nenhanced municipal service and potential investment in downtown.”\n                                 MIXED-USE ALTERNATIVE\n       In addition to the proposed project, the draft EIR also considered a mixed-use\nalternative, which “would include development of less acreage (approximately 60 percent\nor 93 acres) than the proposed project. The Mixed Use Alternative would still include an\nannexation of 154 acres from Yolo County to the City of Woodland. The 93 acres would\nbe prezoned General Commercial (C-2) with a Planned Development Overlay to allow\nthe mixed use nature of the alternative. The remaining acreage would be prezoned to a\nnew zoning designation of Urban Reserve consistent with the General Plan. The southern\nand eastern portion of the property would remain in the existing condition, and would act\nas a buffer between the project and the [Woodland Water Pollution Control Facility]\nlocated to the east of the site, and agricultural uses to the south of the site. Development\nof this alternative would include a five-acre site for a 100-unit multi-family development\nat approximately 20 units per acre. In addition, the commercial portion of the\ndevelopment would include a local-serving commercial town center (with approximately\n50 residential units located above the center) to enhance a sense of community among\nresidents. The commercial portion of the development would include approximately\n200,000 square feet (including restaurants) and two auto dealerships. Development under\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthe Mixed-Use Alternative would be designed to be consistent with SmartGrowth\nprinciples.”3\n       The draft EIR rejected the mixed-use alternative as infeasible. As to this\nalternative, the draft EIR states that “[t]he Mixed Use Alternative would decrease the\ndevelopment of roadways, driveway, and parking areas, as compared to the proposed\nproject. . . . Transportation and circulation impacts are directly related to land\ndevelopment activities. The Mixed Use Alternative would reduce the commercial trips\ngenerated by the proposed project; however, would result in increased trips associated\nwith the proposed residential uses. Therefore, it is assumed that the transportation and\ncirculation impacts of the Mixed Use Alternative would be similar to the proposed\nproject.” (Italics added.)\n                                      ENERGY ANALYSIS\n       The draft EIR addressed the energy impact of Gateway II by determining the\nnational “average annual usage of electricity is roughly 13 kWh/square foot and the\naverage annual usage of natural gas is roughly 37 cubic feet/square foot for commercial\nbuildings.” These national averages were multiplied by the number of square feet\nexpected for Gateway II at full buildout. Thus, the draft EIR stated Gateway II “would\nbe expected to produce a demand for 10,504,000 kWh of electricity annually and\n29,896,000 cubic feet of natural gas annually.”\n       The draft EIR noted any new commercial construction would be subject to\n“[Building Code] energy conservation requirements . . . for non-residential buildings.”\nThe draft EIR also noted that “a substation, multiple utility lines (60 kV, 115 kV, and 230\nkV), and gas transmission lines exist in the area” to provide power to Gateway II. The\ndraft EIR also found the project would generate 40,051 new vehicle trips each day. Of\n\n\n\n\n3      The draft EIR does not define “SmartGrowth principles.”\n\n                                              7\n\fthese, approximately 40 percent would be regional in nature with “much longer trip\nlengths than the standard for City of Woodland retail shopping trips.”\n       Ultimately, the draft EIR concluded Gateway II “would be expected to have a less-\nthan-significant impact regarding the wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption\nof energy” and required no mitigation measures.\n                                        The Final EIR\n       The final EIR was published in June 2011. Regarding the issues raised in this\nappeal, the final EIR essentially reiterated the findings and conclusions set forth in the\ndraft EIR for the Gateway II project.\n                                         URBAN DECAY\n       The final EIR reworded language of the mitigation measures for addressing the\nimpact on urban decay expected for the project. For example, the final EIR revised\nMitigation Measure 4.11-3(a), as follows: “The City shall consider co[o]rdinateing with\nthe current owner of the County Fair Mall to consider a strategic land use plan for the\nCounty Fair Mall to analyze potential viable land uses for the site.” An explanatory note\nfollowing the revised text for the urban decay mitigation measures states, “The above\nchange is for clarification purposes only and does not alter the conclusions in the\nDraft EIR.”\n                                  MIXED-USE ALTERNATIVE\n       The final EIR reiterated the conclusions about the economic infeasibility of the\nmixed-use alternative as set forth in the draft EIR. Specifically, the final EIR again\nconcluded the mixed-use alternative would fail to “better capture leakage of sales from\nuses not already served within the community” or to “develop revenue generating land\nuses to provide jobs.”\n                                        ENERGY ANALYSIS\n       On the issue of “[i]ncreased demand for energy and impacts concerning wasteful,\ninefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy by commercial uses,” the final EIR\n\n                                              8\n\fconcluded no mitigation measures were required because the project would have less than\nsignificant impacts. The final EIR elaborates: “Increased demand for energy and\nimpacts concerning wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy by\ncommercial uses is discussed in impact statement 4.10-7, page 4.10-29 of the Draft EIR,\nChapter 4.10, Public Services and Utilities. The Draft EIR determined that project would\nbe required to comply with or exceed Title 24 guidelines and regulations. Therefore, the\nproject would be expected to have a less-than-significant impact regarding the wasteful,\ninefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy.”\n                               City Approval of Gateway II\n       In September 2011, the Woodland City Council voted three-to-two to: certify the\nfinal EIR, approve Petrovich’s application for annexation, pre-zone the project site to\n61.3 acres designated general commercial, and amend the general plan. In approving the\nproject, the City reduced Gateway II to 61.3 acres and no more than 340,000 square feet\nof commercial space.\n                                        URBAN DECAY\n       As part of its project approval, the City adopted Resolution 6029 (Resolution).\nThe Resolution acknowledges Gateway II will have a deleterious effect on the City’s\ndowntown. Specifically, the Resolution states that “[i]mplementation of the proposed\nproject would result in physical deterioration and urban decay of retail centers in\nDowntown Woodland, East of Downtown, and East of I-5.” (Italics added.) Supporting\nthis finding, the City found that “[t]he proposed project could attract new consumers to\nthe City of Woodland and minimize impacts to existing big box retailers. However,\nshould existing big box retailers relocate to the proposed project, re-leasing of the vacant\nbig box could be difficult, and urban decay could occur in the entire shopping center. In\naddition, excess of retail space (supply) would slow the revitalization of Downtown\nWoodland. As stated above, development of partial buildout of the proposed project\nwould result in short-term excess retail space (supply) and long-term retail leakage.”\n\n                                             9\n\f       Despite the findings regarding downtown urban decay, the City approved the\nproject and noted “that (l) changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated\ninto, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effects\nidentified above and (2) specific economic legal, social, technological, or other\nconsiderations make infeasible certain mitigation measures or alternatives identified in\nthe Final EIR.” To ameliorate the effects of urban decay, the Resolution stated the urban\ndecay mitigation measures set forth in the draft and final EIRs would be required.\n                                  MIXED-USE ALTERNATIVE\n       In contrast to the rationale of economic infeasibility set forth in the EIRs, the\nWoodland City Council rejected the mixed-use alternative on grounds it “would have\ngreater environmental impacts than the proposed project. (State CEQA Guidelines\n§ 15126.6(c).)” (Italics added.) As further explanation, the Resolution stated: “The\nMixed-Use Alternative would result in greater public services and utilities impacts, as\ncompared to the proposed project. Impacts to land use and agricultural resources,\nbiological resources, and hydrology and water quality would be fewer, as compared to\nthe proposed project. All other impacts would be equal to those of the proposed project.\nBecause the Mixed-Use Alternative would, overall, result in greater impacts than the\nproposed project, the Alternative is considered infeasible.”\n                                  ENERGY CONSERVATION\n       The Resolution did not mention the energy considerations set forth in the draft and\nfinal EIRs under section 4.10-7, which required compliance with building codes to\nachieve energy efficiency. Thus, no mitigation measures were adopted to address\ntransportation, construction, or operation energy impacts for Gateway II.\n                CCEC’s Petition for Writ of Mandate in Superior Court\n       In September 2011, CCEC filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court to\nchallenge the City’s certification of the final EIR and its approval of the project. In July\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f2012, the trial court denied the petition in its entirety. CCEC timely filed a notice of\nappeal from the judgment.\n       In September 2012, the trial court awarded costs to the City, with the exception of\nthe City’s request for $6,896.40 related to City staff and consultant time spent in helping\nto prepare the administrative record.4 The City has timely filed a notice of appeal from\nthe post-judgment order awarding costs to the City.\n                                   CEQA OVERVIEW\n       The basic principles of CEQA are by now familiar and well settled. “ ‘[T]he\npurpose of CEQA is to protect and maintain California’s environmental quality. With\ncertain exceptions, CEQA requires public agencies to prepare an EIR for any project they\nintend to carry out or approve whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial\nevidence that the project may have a significant environmental effect. . . .’ (Communities\nfor a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency [(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98],\n106-107, fns. omitted.) The California Supreme Court has ‘repeatedly recognized that\nthe EIR is the “heart of CEQA.” [Citations.] “Its purpose is to inform the public and its\nresponsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are\nmade. Thus, the EIR ‘protects not only the environment but also informed self-\ngovernment.’ ” ’ ” (Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p.\n1169, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California\n(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123; fn. omitted.)\n       To comply with CEQA, “[p]ublic agencies must ‘prepare, or cause to be prepared\nby contract, and certify the completion of, an [EIR] on any project that they intend to\n\n\n\n4       The trial court did not calculate the total costs it awarded to the City. Instead, it\nnoted amounts it was deducting from the request for costs. Even on cross-appeal, the\nCity does not assert what it was actually awarded by the trial court. Given our conclusion\nthat reversal of the judgment on CCEC’s appeal obviates the need to consider the issue\non cross-appeal, we do not need to calculate the actual amount of costs awarded.\n\n                                             11\n\fcarry out or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment.’ (§ 21151,\nsubd. (a).) Section 21065 defines ‘project’ to include ‘an activity which may cause either\na direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical\nchange in the environment, and which is any of the following: [¶] (a) An activity directly\nundertaken by any public agency. [¶] . . . [¶] (c) An activity that involves the issuance to\na person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more\npublic agencies.’ The Guidelines further define project as ‘the whole of an action, which\nhas a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a\nreasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the\nfollowing: [¶] . . . [¶] (3) An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease,\npermit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.’\n(Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (a)(3).) Under CEQA, ‘ “ ‘Project’ is given a broad\ninterpretation . . . to maximize protection of the environment.” ’ ” (Center for Sierra\nNevada Conservation, supra, at pp. 1169–1170, quoting Riverwatch v.

(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1203.)\n       “In reviewing an agency’s compliance with CEQA in the course of its legislative\nor quasi-legislative actions, the courts’ inquiry ‘shall extend only to whether there was a\nprejudicial abuse of discretion.’ (. . . § 21168.5.) Such an abuse is established ‘if the\nagency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision\nis not supported by substantial evidence.’ [Citations.]” (Vineyard Area Citizens for\nResponsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426-427\n(Vineyard), fns. omitted.) “Judicial review of these two types of error differs\nsignificantly: while we determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct\nprocedures, ‘scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements’\n[citation], we accord greater deference to the agency’s substantive factual conclusions. In\nreviewing for substantial evidence, the reviewing court ‘may not set aside an agency’s\napproval of an EIR on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or\n\n                                             12\n\fmore reasonable,’ for, on factual questions, our task ‘is not to weigh conflicting evidence\nand determine who has the better argument.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 435.) “A public\nagency’s decision to certify the EIR is presumed correct, and the challenger has the\nburden of proving the EIR is legally inadequate.” (Santa Monica Baykeeper v. City of\nMalibu (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1538, 1545–1546, citing Sierra Club v. City of Orange\n(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 530; Save Our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County\nBd. of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 117 (Save Our Peninsula).)\n       In a CEQA case, we review the lead agency’s action rather than the trial court’s\nsubsequent decision. Accordingly, we “resolve the substantive CEQA issues on [appeal]\nby independently determining whether the administrative record demonstrates any legal\nerror by the [lead agency] and whether it contains substantial evidence to support the\n[agency’s] factual determinations.” (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 427.) Consistent\nwith these principles of review, we proceed to consider CCEC’s contentions.\n                                   APPEAL BY CCEC\n                                             I\n\n  Whether the Project Conflicts with the City’s General Plan Goals of Preserving an\n                         Economically Viable Downtown\n       CCEC contends the City violated the requirements set forth in its general plan by\napproving Gateway II after finding it would cause urban decay in the City’s downtown.\nThe City responds that the issue has not been preserved for review to the extent it arises\nunder the planning and zoning law. Insofar as the claim arises under CEQA, the City\nargues part of the claim was not presented during the EIR process, and it fully complied\nwith CEQA requirements. We conclude the issue of urban decay is cognizable only to\nthe extent it arises under CEQA.\n       The City approved the annexation of the Gateway II acreage and its zoning change\non September 20, 2011. The City asserts that “[t]he statute of limitations under the State\nPlanning and Zoning Law therefore expired on December 19, 2011.” With this assertion,\n\n\n                                            13\n\fwe have no quarrel because Government Code section 65009, subdivision (c), provides\nthat for a challenge to a land-use zoning change “no action or proceeding shall be\nmaintained in any of the following cases by any person unless the action or proceeding is\ncommenced and service is made on the legislative body within 90 days after the\nlegislative body’s decision: [¶] (A) To attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the\ndecision of a legislative body to adopt or amend a general or specific plan.”\n       However, CCEC filed its petition for writ of mandate in superior court within the\n90-day window –- specifically, within two days after the City’s zoning action. On this\npoint, the City argues CCEC did not actually present the planning and zoning law cause\nof action in its petition. The City acknowledges CCEC presented CEQA causes of action\nand “the Petition alleges the Gateway II project was inconsistent with the City’s General\nPlan.” Nonetheless, the City asserts the zoning claim was not properly presented because\nthe petition did not present the issue as “a separate cause of action” or “alert the City to\nthe allegation that the State Planning and Zoning law had been violated.”\n       CCEC’s petition does contain the factual allegation that “a project such as this one\nwith significant and unmitigated decay impacts that would positively degrade the\ndowntown is not consistent with the General Plan.” However, CCEC’s petition is titled,\n“Petition for writ of mandate pursuant to the Environmental Quality Act.” Each of the\nthree causes of action expressly states a CEQA violation by the City for (1) erroneously\ncertifying a deficient EIR, (2) making findings in support of the project without sufficient\nevidence, and (3) failing to recirculate the final EIR to correct its deficiencies. For these\nCEQA violations, CCEC requested relief in the form of setting aside the final EIR,\ninjunctions preventing construction on the project, and a declaration that the City must\ncomply with CEQA’s EIR requirements before proceeding, and costs of suit.\n       CCEC’s petition is thoroughly steeped in CEQA and does not mention the\nplanning and zoning law. Moreover, the petition requests no relief in the form of\nrezoning or nullifying the City’s action to amend the general plan to annex the acreage\n\n                                              14\n\ffor Gateway II. We agree with the City that the petition failed to alert it that CCEC\nchallenged its actions under the planning and zoning law.\n       “Generally speaking, ‘[t]he complaint in a civil action serves a variety of purposes\n[citation], of which two are relevant here: it serves to frame and limit the issues [citation]\nand to apprise the defendant of the basis upon which the plaintiff is seeking recovery\n[citations]. In fulfilling this function, the complaint should set forth the ultimate facts\nconstituting the cause of action, not the evidence by which plaintiff proposes to prove\nthose facts.’ (Committee On Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983)\n35 Cal.3d 197, 211–212.) [¶] By framing and limiting the issues, the complaint limits\nthe bases upon which a plaintiff may seek to impose liability on a defendant.” (Centex\nHomes v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1090, 1102.) Even though this case\ninvolves a petition rather than a complaint, the City is likewise entitled to be alerted to\nthe basis upon which petitioner CCEC seeks the relief for which it prays. CCEC did not\nplead any planning and zoning law violation in a manner that might have fairly apprised\nthe City of this legal theory for relief.\n       Accordingly, we conclude the claim is not cognizable insofar as it arises under the\nplanning and zoning law. Given the CEQA claim has been preserved but the planning\nand zoning law issue forfeited, the scope of our review is limited to whether the City’s\nstudy and mitigation of urban decay complied with CEQA.\n                                              II\n       Whether the City’s Urban Decay Mitigation Measures Comply with CEQA\n       In addition to challenging Gateway II on grounds it conflicts with the City’s\ngeneral plan, CCEC argues Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(a) through (d) and 4.11-3(a) do\nnot satisfy CEQA requirements. We conclude the City’s urban decay mitigation\nmeasures are inadequate under CEQA.\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f                                            A.\n                   CEQA Encompasses Urban Decay Considerations\n       Under CEQA, a lead agency must address the issue of urban decay in an EIR\nwhen a fair argument can be made that the proposed project will adversely affect the\nphysical environment. “An EIR is to disclose and analyze the direct and the reasonably\nforeseeable indirect environmental impacts of a proposed project if they are significant.\n(Guidelines, §§ 15126.2, 15064, subd. (d)(3).)[5] Economic and social impacts of\nproposed projects, therefore, are outside CEQA’s purview. When there is evidence,\nhowever, that economic and social effects caused by a project, such as a shopping center,\ncould result in a reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impact, such as urban\ndecay or deterioration, then the CEQA lead agency is obligated to assess this indirect\nenvironmental impact.” (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130\nCal.App.4th 1173, 1182 (Anderson First).)\n       When a project will result in an adverse change to the physical environment,\nCEQA instructs that “the agency ‘shall provide that measures to mitigate or avoid\nsignificant effects on the environment are fully enforceable through permit conditions,\nagreements, or other measures’ (§ 21081.6, subd. (b)) and must adopt a monitoring\nprogram to ensure that the mitigation measures are implemented (§ 21081.6, subd. (a)).\nThe purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures will\nactually be implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then\n\n\n\n5       Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: “Direct\nand indirect significant effects of the project on the environment shall be clearly\nidentified and described, giving due consideration to both the short-term and long-\nterm effects.”\n\n       Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (d), requires that both primary and\n“reasonably foreseeable” secondary consequences be considered in determining the\nsignificance of a project’s environmental effect.\n\n                                            16\n\fneglected or disregarded. (See § 21002.1, subd. (b).)” (Federation of Hillside &\nCanyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1260-1261,\nfn. omitted.)\n                                             B.\n                      The City’s Urban Decay Mitigation Measures\n       The issue of urban decay in the City’s downtown and existing retail areas was\nstudied in the draft EIR and its conclusions were reiterated in the final EIR. In the draft\nEIR, the City recognized that if “existing big box retailers relocate to the proposed\nproject, re-leasing of the vacant big box could be difficult, and urban decay could occur\nin the entire shopping center. In addition, excess of retail space (supply) would slow the\nrevitalization of Downtown Woodland. . . . [D]evelopment of partial buildout of the\nproposed project would result in short-term excess retail space (supply) and long-term\nretail leakage.” To ameliorate the urban decay expected to be caused by Gateway II, the\ncity council imposed the following five mitigation measures to combat urban blight\ndowntown and at the County Fair Mall:\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a): At the time of future applications for site-specific\ndevelopment, the project applicant shall submit a request to the Community Development\nDepartment for a Master Conditional Use Permit (CUP), which must include a site plan\nand architectural review, as well as create design standards for alternative transportation,\npedestrian and bicycling access, site plans, and architecture review. The Master CUP\nshall comply with the draft EIR for the project, and will be evaluated at the time of the\nrequest to determine if further environmental review is necessary [for the] list of specific\nproject uses for review and approval by the Community Development Department. The\nMaster CUP shall indicate that the list of specific project uses shall primarily consist of\nregional retail uses that do not include entertainment uses and other uses that would\ncompete with retail in Downtown Woodland.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b): At the time of future applications for site-specific\ndevelopment, the project applicant shall submit a market study for and urban decay\nanalysis, including hotels if proposed, for review and approval by the Community\nDevelopment Department. The market study and urban decay analysis shall show that\nadequate retail demand exists for the proposed uses and that urban decay would not occur\nas a result of the proposed phase of the project. If the market study and urban decay\nanalysis show inadequate demand, then the City shall evaluate the impacts of the use\nproposed for development and either require additional mitigation or require an\nalternate use.\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(c): Prior to the issuance of building permits, the\nproject applicant shall contribute funds toward the development of a Retail Strategic\nPlan. The amount of the fee shall be determined in the Development Agreement between\nthe City and the project applicant. The City would be responsible for preparing a Retail\nStrategic Plan which shall determine what retail areas shall be preserved as retail and\nwhich areas shall be developed as other uses, helping to identify repositioning strategies\nfor those underperforming centers.\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(d): Prior to the issuance of building permits, the\nproject applicant shall contribute funds toward the preparation of an Implementation\nStrategy for the Downtown Specific Plan. The amount of the fee shall be determined in\nthe Development Agreement between the City and the project applicant. The City would\nbe responsible for preparing the Implementation Strategy which, among other things, can\nhelp define the strategies for progressing the civic and entertainment focus of downtown.\n       To address urban blight at the County Fair Mall, Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a)\nrequires the City to “coordinate with the current owner of the County Fair Mall to prepare\na strategic land use plan for the County Fair Mall to analyze potential viable land uses for\nthe site.” However, even with “[i]mplementation of Mitigation Measures 4.11-3(a) and\n4.11-3(b) [to] reduce the intensity and delay urban decay to retail in County Center Mall,\n\n                                            18\n\fWest Woodland, and East Street Corridor,” the City still anticipated that “this impact\nwould remain significant and unavoidable.”\n                                             C.\n                           Preservation of the Issue for Review\n       Before turning to the individual mitigation measures adopted to combat urban\ndecay, we address the City’s contention that CCEC failed to preserve the issue by raising\nit in the trial court. The City’s contention misreads the record.\n       Ordinarily, we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. (Hale v.\nMorgan (1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 394.) In arguing CCEC failed to raise the issue of urban\ndecay in the trial court, the City cites the portion of CCEC’s petition that alleges claims\nunder CEQA. However, that same petition devoted nearly three pages to setting forth\nallegations regarding this issue under the rubric, “Urban Decay.” Those pages clearly\narticulated the alleged inadequacies of the City’s EIRs regarding urban decay and\ndescribed how the mitigation measures fail to combat the problem. In short, the very\ndocument cited by the City dispels its claim of forfeiture.\n       In addition to arguing CCEC failed to raise the issue in the trial court, the City\nasserts CCEC did not challenge Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) during the EIR process.\n“In order to attack a decision that is subject to CEQA, the alleged grounds for\nnoncompliance must have been presented to the public agency, and the person attacking\nthe decision must have raised some objection during the administrative proceedings. (§\n21177, subds. (a), (b).)” (Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City of San Jose (2003)\n114 Cal.App.4th 689, 701.) Although an issue must first have been raised during the\nadministrative process to be preserved for judicial review, it may be argued in court by a\ndifferent person. (Citizens for Open Government v. City of Lodi (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th\n865, 875.) Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) limits Gateway II to consisting “primarily” of\nregional retail usage that does not include civic, entertainment, or other uses that would\ncompete with the downtown.\n\n                                             19\n\f       The City asserts CCEC failed to present the issue during the EIR process. We\nreject the assertion. Having reviewed the administrative record, we conclude specific\nobjections to Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) were raised during the EIR process. For\nexample, one City resident commented on the final EIR by objecting to “the inadequate\nand improper manner of mitigation analysis for serious impacts of urban decay caused by\nthe revised project” and stated that an “inadequate aspect of this mitigation analysis\nrelated to urban decay involves an absence of any relevant specificity of the statement\nthat commercial zoning within the revised project: ‘will primarily consist of regional\nretail uses that do not include . . . uses that would compete with Downtown Woodland.’ ”\nAdditionally, the final EIR itself notes CCEC comment: “The mitigation proposed for\nurban decay is vague and unenforceable.” Accordingly, CCEC may challenge Mitigation\nMeasure 4.11-2(a) because the issue has been preserved for our review.\n                                              D.\n                   Land Use Controls –- Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a)\n       In approving the project, the City adopted Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) to require\nPetrovich to submit “a site plan and architectural review, as well as create design\nstandards for alternative transportation, pedestrian and bicycling access, site plans, and\narchitecture review” when the developer is ready to build on specific sites within the\nproject area. The developer’s application –- along with the supporting documents –- are\nsubject to “review and approval by the Community Development Department.” If the\nCity issues a permit for the application, the permit “shall indicate that the list of specific\nproject uses shall primarily consist of regional retail uses that do not include\nentertainment uses and other uses that would compete with retail in Downtown\nWoodland.”\n       CCEC argues this mitigation measure is meaningless because even if “project uses\nshall primarily consist of regional retail uses,” up to 49 percent of Gateway II may\nconsist of uses directly competing with the City’s downtown retail area. To the extent\n\n                                              20\n\fCCEC’s argument relies on the conflict between land use for Gateway II and the City’s\n2002 general plan, it is forfeited for failure to timely present a claim under the planning\nand zoning law. (See part I, ante.) To the extent the argument arises under CEQA, we\nreject it on the merits.\n       Under CEQA, a project may be adopted even when it will have a significant and\nunavoidable adverse effect on the environment. (California Oak Foundation v. Regents\nof University of California (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 227, 260.) A lead agency may find\nthe “unmitigated effects [to be] outweighed by the project’s benefits.” (Ibid.; Guidelines,\n§ 15093.) And, each individual mitigation measure need not, by itself, be able to cure all\nsignificant impacts resulting from the project. (See, e.g., California Oak Foundation v.\nRegents of University of California, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at p. 279 [adoption of\n“several mitigation measures and continuing best practices” were cumulatively sufficient\nto protect archaeological resources at the project sites].)\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) serves to ensure that the primary retail uses for\nGateway II will be regional, i.e., the type of retail that will not directly compete with the\nCity’s smaller downtown stores. This measure does not run afoul of CEQA because it\ndoes not outright ban all retail uses that compete with the City’s downtown. There is no\nneed to require mutually exclusive retail offerings in the City’s downtown and at\nGateway II. Indeed, such mutual exclusivity might not be possible since overlapping\nproduct offerings might not be avoidable. As to this mitigation measure, we accept the\nCity’s representation that it “merely found that this measure would help, albeit not\nenough to avoid the significant urban decay impact identified by the EIR.” While\nMitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) is permissible under CEQA, it does not, by itself, constitute\nadequate mitigation of anticipated urban decay as a result of Gateway II.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f                                             E.\n                 Future Market Studies –- Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b)\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) requires Petrovich “[a]t the time of future\napplications for site-specific development,” to “submit a market study for and urban\ndecay analysis, including hotels if proposed, for review and approval by the Community\nDevelopment Department.” CCEC argues this measure conflicts with CEQA in four\nways: (1) by “piecemealing” urban decay analysis, (2) by ceding responsibility for\nstudying an environmental impact to the developer, (3) by delegating review and\napproval authority to the City’s community development department, and (4) by failing\nto require specific mitigation actions to alleviate urban decay. We agree with the second\nand fourth contentions.\n       First, Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) does not impermissibly piecemeal the analysis\nof urban decay for Gateway II. It is well settled “ ‘that CEQA forbids “piecemeal”\nreview of the significant environmental impacts of a project.’ (Berkeley [Keep Jets over\nthe Bay Committee v. Board of Port Commissioners (2001)] 91 Cal.App.4th [1344,]\n1358.) Rather, CEQA mandates ‘that environmental considerations do not become\nsubmerged by chopping a large project into many little ones —- each with a minimal\npotential impact on the environment —- which cumulatively may have disastrous\nconsequences.’ (Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283–\n284.) Thus, the Guidelines define ‘project’ broadly as ‘the whole of an action, which has\na potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a\nreasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. . . .’ (Guidelines, §\n15378, subd. (a).) The question of which acts constitute the ‘whole of an action’ for\npurposes of CEQA is one of law, which we review de novo based on the undisputed facts\nin the record. (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora\n(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1224 (Tuolumne County).)” (Communities for a Better\nEnvironment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 98.)\n\n                                             22\n\f       The draft EIR in this case analyzed the urban decay to be expected for the whole\nof the project. The City studied the impacts of developing all 154 acres with a maximum\nof 808,000 square feet of retail space, three hotels, an auto mall, restaurants, and 100,000\nsquare feet of office space. Thus, the City’s EIR had the hallmarks of a program EIR\nintended to address the cumulative impacts of multiple actions –- such as for a multi-\nstage project. (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 429.) Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b)’s\ntiering of further review for applications to build at specific sites within Gateway II does\nnot run afoul of CEQA. “Tiering is proper ‘when it helps a public agency to focus upon\nthe issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review and in order to exclude\nduplicative analysis of environmental effects examined in previous environmental impact\nreports.’ (. . . § 21093, subd. (a); see also [Guidelines] § 15385, subd. (b).)” (In re Bay-\nDelta (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1170.) Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) does not constitute\nimproper piecemealing because the City did not use tiering to downplay or segregate the\ncumulative impact of urban decay arising from Gateway II.\n       Second, CCEC objects to Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) on grounds the market\nstudies are to be completed by the developer. The point is well taken. Under CEQA, a\npublic agency cannot charge a developer with the responsibility to study the impact of a\nproposed project. (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296\n(Sundstrom).) Sundstrom involved a county delegating the duty to conduct hydrology\nimpact studies for construction of a sewage treatment plant to the applicant. (Id. at p.\n307.) The Sundstrom court held CEQA did not allow delegation of “the County’s legal\nresponsibility to assess environmental impact by directing the applicant himself to\nconduct the hydrological studies subject to the approval of the Planning Commission\nstaff. Under CEQA, the EIR or negative declaration must be prepared ‘directly by, or\nunder contract to’ the lead agency. (. . . § 21082.1.) The implementing regulations\nexplicitly provide: ‘The draft EIR which is sent out for public review must reflect the\nindependent judgment of the lead agency.’ ([Guidelines] § 15084, subd. (e).)”\n\n                                             23\n\f(Sundstrom, supra, at p. 307.) Here, Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) shifted the\nresponsibility to Petrovich to produce the market studies in violation of CEQA. (Ibid.)\n       Third, the Woodland City Council did not err by delegating responsibility to\nimplement this mitigation measure to its community development department. In Kleist\nv. City of Glendale (1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 770, the Court of Appeal held a city council\ncannot delegate responsibility for considering an EIR to its planning board. (Id. at\np. 779.) Under CEQA, “the EIR must be presented to the decision making body of the\nagency.” (Sundstrom, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 307.)\n       Here, the city council did act as the decision-making authority when it reviewed\nand approved the final EIR. The city council made the required findings under CEQA\nthat Gateway II would result in significant and unavoidable urban decay impacts. In an\neffort to reduce those impacts, the city council adopted Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b).\nShifting the responsibility to carry out the mitigation in that measure is allowed under\nCEQA. Section 21081.6, subdivision (a)(1), provides that when changes or alterations\nhave been required or incorporated into the project to mitigate or avoid the significant\neffects on the environment, the lead agency “shall adopt a reporting or monitoring\nprogram for the changes made to the project or conditions of project approval, adopted in\norder to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment. The reporting or\nmonitoring program shall be designed to ensure compliance during project\nimplementation.” Delegation of responsibility for a monitoring program is recognized by\nthis section in its requirement that the monitoring “agency shall, if so requested by the\nlead agency or a responsible agency, prepare and submit a proposed reporting or\nmonitoring program.” (Ibid.) CEQA does not require that the Woodland City Council\nitself implement urban decay mitigation measures.\n       Fourth, the market study measure does not commit the City to any specific\nmitigation action or impose any standards for determining whether it must undertake any\nfuture measures. The Resolution adopting the project provides only that “[i]f the market\n\n                                             24\n\fstudy and urban decay analysis show inadequate demand, then the City shall evaluate the\nimpacts of the use proposed for development and either require additional mitigation or\nrequire an alternate use.” Thus, the Resolution approving the project does not identify\nany specific mitigation measures nor does it provide any standards for the community\ndevelopment department to adhere to in deciding whether the developer-proposed\nmitigation is sufficient. “This is inadequate. No criteria or alternatives to be considered\nare set out. Rather, this mitigation measure does no more than require a report be\nprepared and followed, or allow approval by a county department without setting any\nstandards.” (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131\nCal.App.4th 777, 794.)\n       Here, the questions of whether mitigation measures will be required, of what they\nmight consist, and how effective they will be are left unanswered. Given the City’s\nrecognition that Gateway II will cause urban decay, it was required to do more than agree\nto a future study of the problem. “An EIR is inadequate if ‘[t]he success or failure of\nmitigation efforts . . . may largely depend upon management plans that have not yet been\nformulated, and have not been subject to analysis and review within the EIR.’ (San\nJoaquin Raptor [Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007)] 149 Cal.App.4th [645,]\n670.) ‘A study conducted after approval of a project will inevitably have a diminished\ninfluence on decisionmaking. Even if the study is subject to administrative approval, it is\nanalogous to the sort of post hoc rationalization of agency actions that has been\nrepeatedly condemned in decisions construing CEQA.’ ” (Communities for a Better\nEnvironment v. City of Richmond, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 92, quoting Sundstrom,\nsupra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 307.)\n       The City argues the market study mitigation requirement has a specific\nperformance standard in that each market study will have to show there is “adequate\nretail demand for the proposed tenants at the site.” (Italics added.) A showing of\nsufficient demand for the goods sold by a particular planned tenant for Gateway II does\n\n                                             25\n\fnot address the issue of whether urban decay in downtown has been sufficiently\nalleviated. Moreover, the City’s solution to “either require additional mitigation or\nrequire an alternate use” lacks any standard to ensure sufficient abatement of\nurban decay.\n       Lacking any “criteria for success” in abating urban decay, the measure does not\nensure any actual mitigation. (See Communities for a Better Environment v. City of\nRichmond, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 93.) CEQA’s requirements are not met by\nMitigation Measure 4.11-2(b).\n\n                                             F.\n\n  Urban Decay Study and Implementation Program –- Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(c)\n                                     & (d)\n       CCEC contends Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(c) and (d) failed to commit the City\nto any feasible or enforceable mitigation measures to ameliorate the adverse effects of the\nproject on urban decay elsewhere in Woodland. The contention has merit.\n       The City adopted Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(c) to require that Petrovich\n“contribute funds toward the development of a Retail Strategic Plan. The amount of the\nfee shall be determined in the Development Agreement between the City and the project\napplicant.” Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(d) requires Petrovich to “contribute funds toward\npreparation of an Implementation Strategy for the Downtown Specific Plan.” As with the\nretail strategic plan, “[t]he amount of the fee shall be determined in the Development\nAgreement between the City and the project applicant.”\n       A draft of the development agreement in the administrative record provides that\nPetrovich “shall pay its fair share towards (a) a citywide retail strategic plan/suburban\nurban design and re-use analysis (a ‘Retail Strategic Plan’) for existing suburban retail\nstrip centers; and (b) an implementation strategy for the Downtown Specific Plan (an\n‘Implementation Strategy’). The Retail Strategic Plan shall evaluate possible re-uses,\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\finterventions, strategies, and process evaluations. The Implementation Strategy shall,\namong other things, help define the strategies for progressing the civic and entertainment\nfocus of downtown. For purposes of this Paragraph . . . [Petrovich’s] ‘fair share’ for both\nthe Retail Strategic Plan and the Implementation Strategy shall be 50% of the actual cost\nof such studies, provided that [Petrovich’s] collective share for both shall not exceed\n$45,000 in the aggregate.”\n       The call for a retail strategic plan and implementation strategy for a downtown\nspecific plan (fair share plans) appears in the draft EIR without further discussion or\nanalysis. The final EIR adopted these mitigation measures without elaboration.\nConsequently, the entirety of what can be gleaned from the record about the retail\nstrategic plan is that it is intended to “determine what retail areas shall be preserved as\nretail and which areas shall be developed as other uses, helping to identify repositioning\nstrategies for those underperforming centers.” Likewise, the only information about the\nimplementation strategy is that “among other things,” it “can help define the strategies for\nprogressing the civic and entertainment focus of downtown.”\n       These fair share fees correspond to studies that do not obligate the City to\nundertake any actual mitigation of urban decay. By their own terms, Mitigation\nMeasures 4.11-2(c) and (d) require the City only to “prepare” the fair share plans. These\nmitigation measures do not require the City to undertake any action. “A commitment to\npay fees without any evidence that mitigation will actually occur is inadequate.” (Save\nOur Peninsula, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.) Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(c) and (d)\nstand in contrast to the “CEQA require[ment] that feasible mitigation measures actually\nbe implemented as a condition of development, and not merely be adopted and then\nneglected or disregarded.” (Anderson First, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1186-1187.)\n       In Anderson First, this court considered a fair share mitigation fee program that\nrequired the proposed project to pay 16.87 percent of the estimated cost of an interstate\nhighway interchange. (130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1188.) After noting fee-based mitigation\n\n                                              27\n\fprograms may constitute adequate measures under CEQA, Anderson First cautioned that\n“[t]o be adequate, these mitigation fees, in line with the principle discussed above, must\nbe part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to\nimplementing.” (Ibid., italics added.) The mitigation measure in that case did not pass\nmuster under CEQA because it was “vague regarding ‘the program to provide [those]\nimprovements’; in staff reports, City states it [was] preparing an update to the traffic\nimpact fee program to include the I–5 interchange improvements, and note[d] that\n‘Condition 16 requires payment of the impact fee.’ ” (Id. at pp. 1188-1189.) Instead, the\nCity of Anderson was required to “make these fees part of a reasonable, enforceable plan\nor program that is sufficiently tied to the actual mitigation of the traffic impacts at issue.”\n(Id. at p. 1189.)\n       The fees in this case are more speculative than those presented in Anderson First,\nwhere the costs of the transportation improvements had been calculated and were in “no\nserious dispute.” (Anderson First, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1188.) Here, the\nadministrative record does not estimate the cost to prepare the fair share plans. More\nimportantly, the City does not estimate how much the mitigation measures or strategies\ncalled for in these plans will cost or how they might be implemented. Consequently,\nthese are the sort of speculative mitigation measures that do not comply with CEQA. (Id.\nat pp. 1188-1189.)\n       The City counters the fair share plans constitute an adequate mitigation measure to\naddress urban decay. In so arguing, the City relies on this court’s decision in Sacramento\nOld City Assn. v. City Council (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011 (SOCA). SOCA involved a\nchallenge to an EIR prepared for the expansion of a convention center and construction of\nan office tower. (Id. at p. 1016.) The EIR noted adverse impacts on traffic and parking,\nfor which specific mitigation measures were proposed. (Id. at pp. 1020-1022.) In\napproving the project, the City “committed itself to mitigating the impacts of parking and\ntraffic” and “approved funds for a major study of downtown transportation.” (Id. at\n\n                                              28\n\fp. 1029.) Moreover, the EIR in SOCA listed specific mitigation measures and standards\nfor parking utilization that were intended to alleviate adverse effects. (Ibid.)\n       In contrast to the concrete, measurable actions adopted in SOCA, supra, 229\nCal.App.3d 1011, the record in this case contains no evidence the fair share plans exist in\nthe City, such plans would be practicable, or the City has committed to creating such\nplans. Thus, this case more closely resembles the facts presented in Center for Sierra\nNevada Conservation, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 1156. In that case, the County of El\nDorado began allowing developers to clear oak woodlands to a greater extent than\npreviously allowed in exchange for payments to the Option B fee program. (Id. at\np. 1161.) The Option B program, however, remained sufficiently indeterminate to allow\nit to qualify as an adequate mitigation measure under CEQA. As we explained, “neither\nthe general plan nor the program EIR included the necessary details for implementing\nOption B, including specifying the fee rate, the parcels for which the fee would be\nrequired prior to development, or the uses for which the fee would be employed by the\nCounty.” (Id. at p. 1176.)\n       Mitigation fee programs may constitute adequate mitigation to address the adverse\neffects of a project. However, “ ‘to be considered adequate, a fee program at some point\nmust be reviewed under CEQA, either as a tiered review eliminating the need to replicate\nthe review for individual projects, or on a project-level, as-applied basis. . . . Because the\nfees set by the ordinance have never passed a CEQA evaluation, payment of the fee does\nnot presumptively establish full mitigation for a discretionary project.’ ” (Center for\nSierra Nevada Conservation, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1179-80, quoting California\nNative Plant Society v. County of El Dorado (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1030.) Here,\nthe City’s EIRs did not adequately assess the scope of the program or fees necessary to\nadequately address the urban decay impacts expected to result from construction of\nGateway II.\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f                                              G.\n        Urban Decay at the County Fair Mall –- Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a)\n       CCEC contends Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a) purports to alleviate expected urban\ndecay at Woodland’s County Fair Mall but does not require the City to undertake any\nactual mitigation. The point is well taken.\n       In approving Gateway II, the City acknowledged the project “would result in\nphysical deterioration and urban decay of retail centers in County Fair Mall, West\nWoodland, and East Street Corridor.” (Italics added.) Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a)\naddresses urban decay at the County Fair Mall by providing: “The City shall coordinate\nwith the current owner of the County Fair Mall to prepare a strategic land use plan for the\nCounty Fair Mall to analyze potential viable land uses for the site.” The City also\nreiterated that Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(a) through (d) would be implemented.\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a) requires the City to take no action other than to\ncoordinate with the current owner to prepare a plan for viable land uses at the County\nFair Mall. Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a) does not require actual study of this aspect of\nurban decay. Moreover, this mitigation measure does not require any action by the City\nto mitigate the urban decay it may discover to result for the County Fair Mall. Under\nCEQA, this purported mitigation measure is inadequate. (Anderson First, supra, 130\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1188-1189.)\n       At oral argument, the City argued the programmatic nature of the EIR in this case\nallows for future studies and additional mitigation to fulfill CEQA mandates. As this\ncourt has previously explained, “Under Guidelines section 15168, program EIRs are used\nfor a series of related actions that can be characterized as one large project. If a program\nEIR is sufficiently comprehensive, the lead agency may dispense with further\nenvironmental review for later activities within the program that are adequately covered\nin the program EIR. (Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).)” (Center for Sierra Nevada\nConservation, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.) Here, the programmatic nature of the\n\n                                              30\n\fCity’s EIR does not remedy the urban decay mitigation measures’ shortcomings.\nAlthough programmatic, the final EIR purported to study the project as a whole and to\nimplement sufficient mitigation measures to ameliorate the effects of urban decay. No\nfurther mitigation measures or EIR studies for the issue of urban decay are promised\nby the City.\n       Regardless of whether the City intends to conduct further tiered EIRs for parts of\nthe project, the program EIR is defective because it adopts inadequate mitigation\nmeasures for urban decay. “While proper tiering of environmental review allows an\nagency to defer analysis of certain details of later phases of long-term linked or complex\nprojects until those phases are up for approval, CEQA’s demand for meaningful\ninformation ‘is not satisfied by simply stating information will be provided in the future.’\n(Santa Clarita [Organization for Planning the Environment v. County of Los Angeles\n(2003)] 106 Cal.App.4th [715,] 723.) As the CEQA Guidelines explain: ‘Tiering does\nnot excuse the lead agency from adequately analyzing reasonably foreseeable significant\nenvironmental effects of the project and does not justify deferring such analysis to a later\ntier EIR or negative declaration.’ ([Guidelines] § 15152, subd. (b).) Tiering is properly\nused to defer analysis of environmental impacts and mitigation measures to later phases\nwhen the impacts or mitigation measures are not determined by the first-tier approval\ndecision but are specific to the later phases. For example, to evaluate or formulate\nmitigation for ‘site specific effects such as aesthetics or parking’ (id., § 15152\n[Discussion]) may be impractical when an entire large project is first approved; under\nsome circumstances analysis of such impacts might be deferred to a later tier EIR.”\n(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 431.) Having studied and attempted to mitigate the\nurban decay effects from the project as a whole, the City may not excuse inadequate\nmitigation by putting off corrective action to a future date.\n\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\f                                             H.\n                                        Conclusion\n       We conclude the City’s mitigation measures aimed at alleviating the urban decay\nexpected to result from Gateway II do not comply with CEQA. Except for Mitigation\nMeasure 4.11-2(a), we conclude the adopted mitigation measures are insufficient to\nensure the City will take concrete, measurable actions to counteract the urban decay\nexpected to result in downtown and at the County Fair Mall. As to Mitigation Measure\n4.11-2(a), even the City acknowledges it is only a partial solution to the urban decay\nimpacts identified in the draft and final EIRs. Accordingly, the City has failed to adopt\nadequate mitigation measures to address urban decay impacts as required under CEQA.\n                                             III\n                                The Mixed-use Alternative\n       CCEC contends the City failed to give meaningful consideration to project\nalternatives such as the mixed-use alternative. CCEC further argues no substantial\nevidence supports the final EIR’s conclusion the mixed-use alternative was infeasible.\nThe City counters that the issue has been largely forfeited and lacks merit in any event.\nWe conclude the issue is cognizable and CCEC’s arguments have merit.\n                                             A.\n                           Preservation of the Issue for Review\n       The City asserts CCEC forfeited claims that the draft and final EIRs did not\nproperly study traffic or air quality impacts of the mixed-use alternative. While the City\nacknowledges CCEC challenged the lack of consideration given to the mixed-use\nalternative, it asserts there were no comments made that specifically addressed traffic\nimpacts, air quality impacts, or the economic feasibility of the mixed-use alternative. We\nreject the City’s assertion of forfeiture. A cursory review of the draft and final EIRs\nshows these issues were repeatedly raised.\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\f       As to traffic impacts associated with the mixed-use alternative, the final EIR\nexpressly acknowledges a comment letter that urged consideration of project alternatives\non grounds that “[r]ecent studies show that appropriate design of transportation systems\ncan reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from new commercial development up to 66%\nby including mitigation such as transportation demand management, bike and pedestrian\nfriendly facilities, parking supply management, density, transit proximity, and mixed\nuse.” Another commenter complained that “[t]he traffic impacts of the project are\ndifficult to overstate.” This commenter noted the increased number of trips expected;\nmitigation measures such as light-rail, other modes of public transportation, bicycle and\npedestrian-friendly measures, and parking incentives. Citations to traffic studies were\noffered to help formulate effective mitigation measures. Contrary to the City’s assertion,\nthe issue of traffic impacts associated with the project and project alternatives was\ndiscussed during the comment phase of the EIR process.\n       So too, air quality impacts –- including concerns about greenhouse gas emissions\n–- were the subject of numerous comments during the EIR process. Concerns about\ndegradation of air quality as a result of the project were raised during the EIR process. In\nparticular, the Yolo County Board of Supervisors commented that the City was required\n“to identify, quantify, and mitigate for climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions,” but issued a draft EIR that “does not discuss any of these issues.” The board\nof supervisors further asserted: “The [draft EIR] concludes that the proposed 1.1 million\nsquare foot retail and auto mall is consistent with all recommended measures intended to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a close examination of Tables 4.3-15 and\n4.3-16 [in the draft EIR] indicates that most of the ‘consistency’ claims are based on\nmitigation measures that require future studies or plans that will be prepared and applied\nto the project either ‘prior to issuance of grading permits’ or ‘at the time of submittal of\nthe detailed development plans for Planning Commission review.’ [¶] As one example,\nboth tables cite Mitigation Measure 4.3-2, which requires the applicant to submit a GHG\n\n                                              33\n\freduction strategy that ‘shall describe in text and on the site plan’ how nine very broad\nstandards will be implemented. The standards include such guidance as ‘reuse and\nrecycle construction and demolition waste’ and ‘create water-efficient landscapes.’\nHowever, no details on how compliance will be achieved and/or no specific approval\nprocedures for future phasing are required to ensure that the measures will achieve GHG\nreduction.” Nonetheless, the final EIR concluded that “[t]he City has imposed all\nfeasible mitigation to reduce air quality impacts of the project.” Regardless of the\ncorrectness of the final EIR’s conclusion, it is clear the issue of air quality impacts was\nraised as part of the EIR process.\n       As to the economic viability of the mixed-use alternative, CCEC argued during the\nEIR process: “The City should reject as inadequate the basis provided in the EIR for\nrejecting the Mixed-Use Alternative and the Reduced Intensity Alternative. It is clear\nthat both of these as well as alternative commercial sites along the rail corridor provide\nfeasible alternatives that would reduce impacts while meeting project objectives. [¶] The\nattempted justification for the adverse environmental impacts is not adequate. The EIR\nstates that the project is intended to prevent ‘leakage of sales,’ but this term is never\ndefined or explained. In particular there is no explanation of why it is necessary to build\na commercial center that serves four counties in order to prevent ‘leakage of sales’ from\nthe City of Woodland.” CCEC’s critique of the “leakage of sales” rationale used by the\nCity to dismiss the mixed-use alternative was included in its briefing in the trial court.\nAccordingly, the issue of whether economic infeasibility served as a basis for rejecting\nthe mixed-use alternative has been preserved for our review.\n                                              B.\n          CEQA Requires the Lead Agency to Consider Feasible Alternatives\n       The California Supreme Court has explained, “CEQA’s substantive mandate that\npublic agencies refrain from approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives\nor mitigation measures is effectuated in section 21081. (See City of Poway [v. City of\n\n                                              34\n\fSan Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d [1037,] 1045–1046.) Under this provision, a\ndecisionmaking agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant\nenvironmental effects have been identified unless it makes specific findings about\nalternatives and mitigation measures. (§ 21081; see also Environmental Council v. Board\nof Supervisors (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 428, 439.) The requirement ensures there is\nevidence of the public agency’s actual consideration of alternatives and mitigation\nmeasures, and reveals to citizens the analytical process by which the public agency\narrived at its decision. (Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta (1988) 198\nCal.App.3d 433, 440–441; City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal.App.3d at p. 1046; Resource\nDefense Fund v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 896.)\nUnder CEQA, the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that,\nnotwithstanding a project’s impact on the environment, the agency’s approval of the\nproposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation\nmeasures. (City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal.App.3d at p. 1046.)” (Mountain Lion\nFoundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.)\n                                              C.\n                    The City’s Rejection of the Mixed-use Alternative\n       The City’s draft EIR stated it limited its discussion to feasible alternatives.\nInfeasible alternatives were described in the draft EIR as “[t]hose alternatives that would\nhave impacts identical to or more severe than the proposed project, and/or that would not\nmeet any or most of the project objectives.” The draft EIR analyzed two alternative\ndesigns for Gateway II: a reduced-intensity alternative and a mixed-use alternative.\n       The reduced-intensity alternative would be limited to 295,000 square feet of retail\n(including restaurants) and two auto dealerships –- all encompassing no more than\n93 acres.\n       The mixed-use alternative would also be limited to a total of 93 acres. It would\nconsist of 200,000 square feet of commercial development (including restaurants), two\n\n                                              35\n\fauto dealerships, and a “five acre site for a 100-unit multi-family development at\napproximately 20 units per acre.” This alternative would also include “a local-serving\ncommercial town center (with approximately 50 residential units located above the\ncenter) to enhance a sense of community among residents.”\n       The draft EIR rejected the reduced-intensity alternative and mixed-use alternative\non the grounds of economic infeasibility. It concluded, “these alternatives would not\nmeet the following project objectives related to economic feasibility: [¶] 1) Facilitate the\ndevelopment of a regional retail center to better capture leakage of sales from uses not\nalready served within the community; and [¶] [(2)] Develop revenue generating land\nuses to provide jobs and capture regional retail leakage.”\n       As to the environmental impacts of the mixed-use alternative, the draft EIR\nassumed similarity with Gateway II as proposed. The draft EIR explains: “The Mixed\nUse Alternative would decrease the development of roadways, driveway, and parking\nareas, as compared to the proposed project. . . . Transportation and circulation impacts\nare directly related to land development activities. The Mixed Use Alternative would\nreduce the commercial trips generated by the proposed project; however, would result in\nincreased trips associated with the proposed residential uses. Therefore, it is assumed\nthat the transportation and circulation impacts of the Mixed Use Alternative would be\nsimilar to the proposed project.” (Italics added.)\n       The draft EIR contains no evidence the mixed-use alternative would have similar\nor greater environmental impacts than the project as proposed by Petrovich. In the final\nEIR, the City asserted that “[t]he draft EIR included analysis of a Mixed-Use Alternative\nwhich would result in fewer impacts related to physical deterioration and urban decay.”\n       In approving Gateway II, the City did not reject the mixed-use alternative on\ngrounds of economic infeasibility as set forth in the draft EIR. Instead, the City declared:\n“For the reasons set forth below in the Supporting Explanation, the City Council rejects\nthe Mixed Use Alternative because (1) it is infeasible and ([2]) because the Mixed-Use\n\n                                             36\n\fAlternative would have greater environmental impacts than the proposed project. (State\nCEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(c).) . . . [¶] Supporting Explanation: The Mixed-Use\nAlternative would result in greater public services and utilities impacts, as compared to\nthe proposed project. Impacts to land use and agricultural resources, biological\nresources, and hydrology and water quality would be fewer, as compared to the proposed\nproject. All other impacts would be equal to those of the proposed project. Because the\nMixed-Use Alternative would, overall, result in greater impacts than the proposed\nproject, the Alternative is considered infeasible. (Draft EIR, pp. 6-11 to 6-15.)” The\nCity’s conclusion about environmental impacts was also in the final EIR, which noted\nthis alternative would have “fewer impacts related to physical deterioration and\nurban decay.”\n       Gateway II, as approved, significantly scaled back the scope of the project to 61.3\nacres of “General Commercial” development. However, the City did not explain how the\nmixed-use alternative could be deemed economically infeasible with only 93 acres of\ndevelopment (comprising 200,000 square feet of future commercial development in\naddition to five acres of residential housing units) when the approved project consists of\nonly 61.3 acres (comprising “up to 340,000 square feet of future commercial\ndevelopment”).\n                                            D.\n                         Feasibility of the Mixed-use Alternative\n       Although the draft and final EIRs rejected the mixed-use alternative on grounds of\neconomic infeasibility, the City approved the project on grounds the mixed-use\nalternative was environmentally inferior. The City did not acknowledge it switched from\nthe rationale of “economic infeasibility” due to “leakage of sales” to one of “greater\nenvironmental impacts” as the ground for rejecting the mixed-use alternative. The\nadministrative record does not indicate the City discovered additional information\nshowing the mixed-use alternative to be an inferior environmental alternative.\n\n                                            37\n\f       The City attempts to explain its shift by asserting that “[t]he determination in the\nEIR that the Mixed-Use Alternative failed to meet project objectives was the opinion of\nthe City’s EIR consultants.” (Italics changed.) The City continues that “[a]s such, the\nfeasibility conclusions in the EIR were not binding on the City Council, and the Council\nhad discretion to reach conclusions that differed from those in the EIR.” We disagree.\n       The City adopted a rationale unsupported by its EIR analysis. The City’s\nunexplained switch from a rationale of economic infeasibility to environmental inferiority\nas the basis for rejecting the mixed-use alternative conflicts with CEQA’s requirement to\n“disclose ‘the “analytic route the . . . agency traveled from evidence to action” ’ . . . .”\n(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 445, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Ass’n v.\nRegents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 404 (Laurel Heights I).) Here,\nthe City’s administrative process sheds no light on how it came to reject the mixed-use\nalternative based on environmental inferiority instead of economic infeasibility in the\ndraft and final EIRs. Consequently, the City has failed to comply with CEQA in\nrejecting the mixed-use alternative on grounds of environmental inferiority to the project\nas approved.\n                                              IV\n\nWhether the Final EIR Failed to Properly Identify and Analyze Potentially Significant\n                    Energy Impacts Resulting from Gateway II\n       CCEC argues the City’s EIRs did not properly analyze or mitigate the potentially\nsignificant energy impacts generated by Gateway II. We agree.\n                                              A.\n                                     Issue Preservation\n       The City asserts CCEC forfeited its contentions regarding energy impacts because\nCCEC did not cite Appendix F during the EIR process. Appendix F of the CEQA\nGuidelines requires that projects assess the energy impacts of a project when a fair\n\n\n\n                                              38\n\fargument can be made that the project will have significant environmental impact. (See\npart IV C., post [examining Appendix F].) We disagree.\n       CCEC was not required to cite specific sections of the CEQA Guidelines to\npreserve the issue of energy impacts for review. “This is because ‘ “[i]n administrative\nproceedings, [parties] generally are not represented by counsel. To hold such parties to\nknowledge of the technical rules of evidence and to the penalty of waiver for failure to\nmake a timely and specific objection would be unfair to them.” (Note (1964) Hastings\nL.J. 369, 371.) It is no hardship, however, to require a layman to make known what facts\nare contested.’ (Kirby v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 1009,\n1020.)” (Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo\n(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 163, italics added.)\n       CCEC presented its concerns about the potential energy impacts of Gateway II to\nthe City during the EIR process. Under the rubric “Energy Impacts,” CCEC commented:\n“The EIR should contain a cumulative evaluation of the energy impacts that would be\ninvolved in the construction and operation of the center. For example, project\nimplementation would involve building pads, roads, and appurtenant improvements.\nThis construction requires energy including diesel fuel. Additional energy is required for\nthe construction of structures. [¶] The energy impacts of future project operation should\nbe evaluated. The operation of commercial buildings requires electricity and natural gas\nfor space heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, water heating, equipment operation,\nmaintenance, etc. The cumulative impacts on energy supplies and energy-efficient\ndesign alternatives should be evaluated.”\n       Also during the EIR process, CCEC addressed its concerns about transportation\nenergy impacts. CCEC commented: “Direct and indirect energy impacts should be\nevaluated including energy that would be consumed in the construction and operation of\nthe required transportation infrastructure and in the manufacture, operation, and\nmaintenance of on-road vehicles.”\n\n                                            39\n\f       Consequently, the City’s assertion that the issue of transportation energy was not\naddressed during the administrative process lacks merit. CCEC included its energy\nimpact concerns in its briefing on the issue in the trial court. Thus, CCEC has preserved\nthe issue of energy impacts for review.\n                                             B.\n                           The City’s Energy Impacts Analysis\n       The entirety of the City’s energy impacts analysis for Gateway II comprises less\nthan a page in the draft EIR.6 In pertinent part, the draft EIR states: “Based upon reports\n\n\n6      Upon reviewing the record, it appears the EIRs and the Resolution required a\nnumber of measures that would likely have the collateral effect of substantial energy-\nsaving effects. However, these directives are adopted under the rubric of reducing\n“overall project-generated emissions of ozone-precursor pollutants by approximately\n15 percent.” (Italics added.) Given that these measures address ozone-precursor\npollutants rather than energy impacts, it is understandable that the City does not rely on\nMitigation Measure 4.3-2 in defending the adequacy of the proposed energy saving\nmitigation measures.\n\n        Mitigation Measure 4.3-2 appears to require Petrovich to “[d]esign buildings to be\nenergy efficient. Site buildings to take advantage of shade, prevailing winds, landscaping\nand sun screens to reduce energy use. [¶] Install efficient lighting and lighting control\nsystems. Daylight should be used as an integral part of lighting systems in buildings,\nsufficient to provide lighting for 75 percent of interior work spaces of proposed buildings.\n[¶] Install light colored ‘cool’ roofs and pavements (i.e., high reflectance, high emittance\nroof surfaces, or exceptionally high reflectance and low emittance surfaces) and\nstrategically placed shade trees. [¶] Install energy efficient heating and cooling systems,\nappliances and equipment, and control systems. [¶] Install light emitting diodes (LEDs)\nfor traffic, street, and other outdoor lighting. [¶] Limit the hours of operation of outdoor\nlighting. [¶] Provide the necessary facilities and infrastructure to encourage the use of\nlow or zero-emission vehicles (e.g., electric vehicle charging facilities and conveniently\nlocated alternative fueling stations) and public transit into project design. [¶] Include\ninternal pedestrian and bicycle routes that connect to adjacent pedestrian and bicycle\nroutes; as well as, transit stops located either onsite or along adjacent roadways. Create\ntravel routes that ensure that destinations may be reached conveniently by public\ntransportation, bicycling or walking. [¶] Promote ridesharing programs (e.g., by\ndesignating a certain percentage of parking spaces for ride sharing, designating adequate·\npassenger loading and unloading and waiting areas for ride sharing vehicles). [¶] Plant\n\n                                             40\n\fand data provided by the California Energy Commission and the Energy Information\nAdministration of the USDOE, the average annual usage of electricity is roughly 13\nkWh/square foot and the average annual usage of natural gas is roughly 37 cubic\nfeet/square foot for commercial buildings. Based upon these figures the proposed project\nwould be expected to produce a demand for 10,504,000 kWh of electricity annually and\n29,896,000 cubic feet of natural gas annually.\n       “The [Building Code] energy conservation requirements for non-residential\nbuildings would be applied. . . . [¶] Pursuant to the [Building Code] and the Energy\nEfficiency Standards, the City of Woodland would review the design components of the\nenergy efficiency and conservation measures as specific plans are submitted. In addition,\na substation, multiple utility lines (60 kV, 115 kV, and 230 kV), and gas transmission\nlines exist in the area to serve the buildout of the proposed project.\n       “The proposed project would be subject to the above-identified reviews to ensure\nthat the project complies with (or exceeds) Title 24 guidelines and regulations.\nTherefore, although the project would result in an increased demand for energy, the\nproposed project would be expected to have a less-than-significant impact regarding the\nwasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy.\n\n\nand maintain trees to help shade hardscape parking and pedestrian surfaces. [¶]\nIncorporate onsite transit facility improvements (e.g., pedestrian shelters, route\ninformation, benches, lighting) to coincide with existing or planned transit service. [¶]\nProvide on-site bicycle storage and showers for employees that bike to work. [¶] Air\nconditioning with Non-HCFC refrigerants should be installed in new buildings. [¶]\nBuilding equipment should be Energy-Star rated to the extent applicable. [¶] Design on-\nsite structures to exceed California Title 24 energy conservation requirements.”\n\n       Although there is likely to be a high correlation between reducing greenhouse\nemissions and energy savings, this court cannot assume the overlap is sufficient under\nCEQA’s study and mitigation requirements. As CCEC correctly observes, “Air quality\nmitigation is not a substitute for an energy analysis.” Thus, we will not consider\nMitigation Measure 4.3-2 in our discussion of mitigation measures addressing energy\nimpacts.\n\n                                              41\n\f       “Mitigation Measure(s) [¶] None required.”\n       The City’s final EIR adopted the draft EIR’s analysis without substantive change.\n                                             C.\n                          Appendix F to the CEQA Guidelines\n       Under CEQA, an EIR is “fatally defective” when it fails “to include a detailed\nstatement setting forth the mitigation measures proposed to reduce wasteful, inefficient,\nand unnecessary consumption of energy.” (People v. County of Kern (1976) 62\nCal.App.3d 761, 774.) The requirement to adopt energy impact mitigation measures “is\nsubstantive and not procedural in nature and was enacted for the purpose of requiring the\nlead agencies to focus upon the energy problem in the preparation of the final EIR.” (Id.\nat p. 774.) However, “lead agencies have not consistently included such analysis in their\nEIRs.” (Cal. Natural Resources Agency, Final Statement of Reason for Regulatory\nAction: Amendments to the State CEQA Guidelines Addressing Analysis and Mitigation\nof Greenhouse Gas Emissions Pursuant to SB97 (Dec. 2009), p. 71.) For this reason, the\nCalifornia Natural Resources Agency amended Appendix F to the CEQA Guidelines in\n2009 “to ensure that lead agencies comply with the substantive directive in section\n21100(b)(3).”7 (People v. County of Kern, supra, at p. 774.)\n       Appendix F of the Guidelines declares that “[t]he goal of conserving energy\nimplies the wise and efficient use of energy.” (Guidelines, app. F, § (I).) To this end,\nAppendix F notes that “[t]he means of achieving this goal include: [¶] (1) decreasing\noverall per capita energy consumption, [¶] (2) decreasing reliance on fossil fuels such as\ncoal, natural gas and oil, and [¶] (3) increasing reliance on renewable energy sources.”\n\n\n\n\n7      Section 21100, subdivision (b), provides than an EIR “shall include a detailed\nstatement setting forth all of the following: [¶] . . . [¶] (3) Mitigation measures proposed\nto minimize significant effects on the environment, including, but not limited to,\nmeasures to reduce the wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of energy.”\n\n                                             42\n\f(Ibid.) Thus, Appendix F provides that “[p]otentially significant energy implications of a\nproject shall be considered in an EIR to the extent relevant and applicable to the project.”\n(Id. at § II.) Among the factors to be considered, if applicable to the project, are\n“[p]otential measures to reduce wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary consumption of\nenergy during construction, operation, maintenance and/or removal” including\n“[a]lternate fuels (particularly renewable ones) or energy systems.” (Id. at § (D)(4).)\n                                             D.\n                           The City’s Energy Impacts Analysis\n                            1. Transportation Energy Impacts\n       Appendix F states that environmental impacts subject to the EIR process include\n“[t]he project’s projected transportation energy use requirements and its overall use of\nefficient transportation alternatives.” (Guidelines, app. F, subd. (II)(C)(6).) Here, the\nCity’s draft EIR anticipated Gateway II would generate up to 40,051 new vehicle trips\neach day. Of these, 40 percent of the trips were expected to originate outside the city.\nNonetheless, the City concluded the energy impacts from the project would be less than\nsignificant. In so concluding, the City’s energy impacts analysis did not address the\ntransportation energy impacts of the project.\n       On appeal, the City does not deny its EIRs did not assess transportation energy\nimpacts. Instead, the City argues its reduction of the size of the project as approved\nnecessarily means some of the transportation energy impact was mitigated. The City also\nasserts it has mitigation measures designed to reduce vehicle trips. Of course, the City\ncannot say how much less transportation energy is needed for the project as approved\nbecause the issue has never been assessed in an EIR. CEQA EIR requirements are not\nsatisfied by saying an environmental impact is something less than some previously\nunknown amount. (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 445; Laurel Heights I, supra, 47\nCal.3d at p. 404)\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f       We conclude the City’s EIR analysis is deficient insofar as it does not assess or\nconsider mitigation for transportation energy impacts of the project.\n                     2. Construction and Operational Energy Impacts\n       Appendix F states that when relevant to a project, an EIR should consider:\n“Energy consuming equipment and processes which will be used during construction,\noperation and/or removal of the project. If appropriate, this discussion should consider\nthe energy intensiveness of materials and equipment required for the project.”\n(Guidelines, app. F, subd. (II)(A)(1), italics added.) Further, Appendix F notes an EIR\nshould consider whether the project involves “Unavoidable Adverse Effect” such as\n“wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary consumption of energy during the project\nconstruction, operation, maintenance and/or removal that cannot be feasibly mitigated.”\n(Id. at subd. (II)(F).)\n       In approving Gateway II, the City found that requiring Petrovich to comply with\nthe Building Code sufficed to address energy impact concerns for the project. “California\nbuilding standards are contained in title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.\n(International Assn. of Plumbing etc. Officials v. California Building Stds. Com. (1997)\n55 Cal.App.4th 245, 248.) Included in those standards are the California Building\nEnergy Efficiency Standards. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, part 6.)” (Tracy First v. City of\nTracy (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 912, 932 (Tracy First).) Although the Building Code\napplies to all nonresidential buildings, it does not extend beyond the buildings\nthemselves. It addresses the building’s envelope, exterior lighting, and signage.\n(Building Code, § 100, subd. (b) & Table 100-A, [“Application of Standards”].) Thus,\nthe Building Code sets forth minimum efficiency requirements for air-conditioning,\nheating, windows, roofs, and insulation. (Building Code, §§ 112, 116, 118, 123.)\n       Although the Building Code addresses energy savings for components of a new\ncommercial construction, it does not address many of the considerations required under\nAppendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. These considerations include whether a building\n\n                                            44\n\fshould be constructed at all, how large it should be, where it should be located, whether it\nshould incorporate renewable energy resources, or anything else external to the building’s\nenvelope. Here, a requirement that Gateway II comply with the Building Code does not,\nby itself, constitute an adequate assessment of mitigation measures that can be taken to\naddress the energy impacts during construction and operation of the project.\n         The City asserts that, in addition to the Building Code, the “[p]roject must also\ncomply with [CALGreen], which contains further requirements for energy conservation\nin new construction.” CALGreen took effect on January 1, 2011. (Cal. Building\nStandards Com. (2010) Cal. Green Building Standards Code: CALGreen, p. i.) As it\napplies to nonresidential new construction, CALGreen is intended to provide guidance on\n“planning, design and development methods that include environmentally responsible site\nselection, building design, building siting and development to protect, restore and\nenhance the environmental quality of the site and respect the integrity of adjacent\nproperties.” (CALGreen, § 5.101.) As the draft EIR noted, CALGreen sets forth such\nrequirements as a 20 percent reduction in indoor water use, separate water meters for\nnonresidential buildings, diversion of construction waste from landfills, energy systems\ninspections for buildings larger than 10,000 square feet, and low-pollutant interior finish\nmaterials.\n         Like the Building Code, CALGreen does not address construction and operational\nenergy impacts for a project intended to transform agricultural land into a regional\ncommercial shopping center. (See CALGreen, §§ 5.201.1-5.508.) Moreover, CALGreen\ndoes not address transportation energy impacts for a project such as Gateway II. (See\nibid.)\n         We also reject the City’s reliance on Tracy First, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th 912.\nThat case involved a challenge under CEQA to the City of Tracy’s approval to build a\n95,900-square-foot supermarket. (Tracy First at p. 916.) The City of Tracy’s EIR\nincluded 17 pages discussing energy issues and 8 pages discussing energy impacts. The\n\n                                              45\n\fEIR concluded no mitigation measures were required because there was no significant\nenergy impact. (Id. at pp. 930-931.) On appeal, Tracy First made “an argument with\nrespect to the EIR’s reliance on the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards that\n[was] difficult to comprehend.” (Id. at p. 933.) The Tracy First court concluded, as to\nthe “argument that it is improper to rely on state building standards in determining\nwhether an energy impact is significant, we disagree. CEQA requires ‘[m]itigation\nmeasures proposed to minimize significant effects on the environment, including, but not\nlimited to, measures to reduce the wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of\nenergy.’ (. . . § 21100, subd. (b)(3).) The California Building Energy Efficiency\nStandards are meant to promote energy efficiency, as the name implies. In other words,\nthey ‘reduce the wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of energy.’\n[Citation.] Other than arguing that reliance on the building standards is not enough,\nTracy First makes no argument concerning what more the EIR should have done.”\n(Tracy First, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at pp. 933-934, italics added.) Ultimately, with\nrespect to energy impacts, the Tracy First court held Tracy First had failed to show that\nthe City of Tracy prejudicially abused its discretion based on lack of substantial evidence.\n(Id. at p. 936.)\n       Here, unlike Tracy First, the City did not properly assess the construction and\noperational energy impacts of Gateway II. Tellingly, the City concedes the draft EIR\n“did not consider the potential energy impacts associated with the additional square\nfootage of [uses other than the 808,000 square feet of retail space] assumed at buildout.”\nThus, the City acknowledges it did not study the construction or operational energy\nimpacts of three hotels, a 20,000 square foot restaurant, three fast food restaurants, an\nauto mall, and 100,000 square feet of office space. Although the City characterized the\nomission as nonprejudicial, the failure to study the energy impacts resulting from a large\npart of the planned construction is not inconsequential. “ ‘ The error is prejudicial “if the\nfailure to include relevant information precludes informed decisionmaking and informed\n\n                                             46\n\fpublic participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process.” ’ (San\nJoaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 721–722.)” (Save Our Peninsula, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 118.) Thus, we reject\nCity’s assertion it would have approved the project regardless of what a proper energy\nimpacts analysis would have been. We conclude the City’s EIRs were inadequate\nbecause they lacked a discussion or analysis of the energy impacts of the project.\n                              3. Renewable Energy Impacts\n       The introduction to Appendix F states that its goals include “increasing reliance on\nrenewable energy sources.” (Guidelines, app. F, subd. (I)(3).) Appendix F further states\nthat “Mitigation Measures may include: [¶] . . . [¶] 4. Alternate fuels (particularly\nrenewable ones) or energy systems.” (Id. at subd. (II)(D)(4).) Nonetheless, the City’s\nEIRs for Gateway II do not indicate any investigation into renewable energy options that\nmight be available or appropriate for the project.\n       The City responds that it “was not required to incorporate any renewable energy\nfeatures suggested by [CCEC] in order to reduce renewable energy features.” This\nassertion misses the point of CCEC’s claim under CEQA: the City’s EIRs omit any\ndiscussion or analysis of renewable energy options for Gateway II. CEQA is violated\nwhen an EIR contains no discussion of a potentially significant environmental\nconsideration. (California Oak Foundation v. City of Santa Clarita (2005) 133\nCal.App.4th 1219, 1236)\n       Here, the City’s EIRs failed to comply with the requirements of Appendix F to the\nGuidelines by not discussing or analyzing renewable energy options.\n                       APPEAL BY THE CITY OF WOODLAND\n                                             V\n                                       Taxing Costs\n       On cross-appeal, the City argues it should have been awarded costs associated\nwith helping to prepare the administrative record. The trial court denied the City’s\n\n                                             47\n\frequest for record preparation costs finding the circumstances did not warrant “an award\nof costs to [the City] in order ‘to preserve the statutory purposes of cost containment and\nexpediting CEQA litigation.’ ” Under CEQA, “the prevailing party in a CEQA action\nmay recover ‘reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation’ of the record, even if\nthe non-prevailing party elected to prepare the record pursuant to section 21167.6,\nsubdivision (b)(2).” (St. Vincent’s School for Boys, Catholic Charities CYO v. City of\nSan Rafael (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 989, 1019, italics added.) Our conclusion that the\nCity erred in several respects under CEQA necessitates remand and renders any\ndetermination of costs to the prevailing party premature.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is reversed, and the matter remanded to the trial court to grant\nCalifornia Clean Energy Committee’s petition for writ of mandate on grounds (1) the\nCity of Woodland’s urban decay mitigation measures are insufficient under the California\nEnvironmental Quality Act, (2) the final environmental impact report violates the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act by not properly assessing the feasibility of the\nmixed-use alternative, and the City of Woodland’s rationale for rejecting the mixed-use\nalternative is not supported by substantial evidence in its environmental impact reports,\nand (3) the City of Woodland did not properly assess transportation, construction, and\noperational energy impacts in its environmental impact reports.\n       The trial court shall vacate the award of costs to the City of Woodland as the\nprevailing party and shall retain jurisdiction over this action by way of a return to the writ\nof mandate demonstrating the City of Woodland has rescinded its final environmental\nimpact report certification and project approval, after which the City of Woodland shall\nexercise its independent judgment as to how to proceed.

California Clean\nEnergy Committee (CCEC), a California nonprofit organization, filed a petition for writ\nof mandate under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fCode, §§ 21050 et seq.) to challenge the City’s certification of its final environmental\nimpact report (final EIR) and approval of the project.1 The City opposed the petition,\nwhich was denied in its entirety by the trial court.\n       CCEC appeals, contending (1) the trial court erred in concluding Gateway II did\nnot conflict with the City’s general plan, (2) the City’s mitigation measures are\ninsufficient to ameliorate the urban decay that will be caused by Gateway II, (3) the City\ndid not give meaningful consideration to feasible project alternatives such as the mixed-\nuse alternative, and (4) the final EIR did not properly identify and analyze potentially\nsignificant energy impacts generated by Gateway II.\n       The City asserts claims regarding conflicts between Gateway II and the general\nplan are not cognizable because CCEC did not comply with the statute of limitations\nimposed by the planning and zoning law (Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.). The City\nadditionally asserts CCEC failed to present the CEQA issues in the trial court or during\nthe administrative process. The City further argues it properly considered each of the\nother issues raised by CCEC but rejected them as it is allowed to do under CEQA. And,\nthe City asserts it committed to implementing mitigation measures sufficient to\nameliorate urban decay expected to result from Gateway II.\n       The City also cross-appeals, contending the trial court erroneously granted\nCCEC’s motion to tax costs. Specifically, the City claims it should have received its\ncosts for helping prepare the administrative record. CCEC responds that a public agency\ncannot recover costs when the CEQA petitioner has elected to prepare the record.\n\n\n\n\n1      Undesignated statutory references are to the Public Resources Code.

App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1161, fn. 1 (Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation).)\n\n                                              2\n\f       We conclude CCEC’s petition in the trial court did not assert a cause of action\narising under the planning and zoning law. Consequently, CCEC has not preserved the\nissue of whether the rezoning of the land for Gateway II conflicts with the City’s\ngeneral plan.2\n       On the merits, we conclude the City’s mitigation measures for alleviating the\nanticipated urban decay in its downtown and at a local shopping mall are inadequate\nunder CEQA. Although one of the five mitigation measures is likely to lessen the effects\nof urban decay, even the City recognizes it alone does not constitute sufficient mitigation.\nThe remaining urban decay mitigation measures are too speculative, vague, or\nnoncommittal to comply with CEQA. As to the City’s consideration of project\nalternatives, we conclude the EIRs did not properly assess the merits of the mixed-use\nalternative. On the issue of energy impacts, we conclude CEQA required the City to\nassess transportation, construction, and operation energy impacts resulting from Gateway\nII. The City’s reliance on the California Building Standards Code (Cal. Code Regs., tit.\n24, part 6) (Building Code) and California Green Building Standards Code (Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 24, part 11) (CALGreen) did not suffice to address issues of transportation,\nconstruction, and operation energy impacts.\n       Our conclusion that the judgment must be reversed obviates our need to consider\nthe City’s issue on cross-appeal, which depends on the City being the prevailing party on\nthe CEQA claims.\n\n\n\n\n2      However, the City’s additional assertions of forfeiture of the CEQA issues are\ntroubling because they are contradicted by the record. In a case in which the appellate\nrecord consists of 18,010 pages, claims regarding failure to assert a point during the EIR\nprocess should be more carefully presented.\n\n                                              3\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n                                 The City’s General Plan\n       The City adopted its general plan in December 2002. In it, the City announced it\nintended “[t]o revitalize the Downtown district as the heart of the city. [¶] With a stock\nof historic buildings that tie the community to its past, Downtown is the center of\ncommunity activity and a primary source of Woodland’s identity. The General Plan\nseeks to preserve Downtown’s central location and its function as a center for community\nactivities by continuing the City’s revitalization efforts and considering the effects of\nother land use decisions on Downtown vitality.”\n                                  The Gateway II Project\n       The first phase of the development (Gateway I) was approved in 2006 and\ninvolved Petrovich’s development of 49 acres of agricultural land for retail and\ncommercial uses on the edge of the City –- near the intersection of Interstate Highway 5\n(I-5) and Yolo County Road 102. Gateway I was completed and began leasing when\nPetrovich submitted a plan to the City for development of the next phase of the project\n(Gateway II). In February 2007, Petrovich filed an application with the City to annex\napproximately 154 acres of farmland to the City and to rezone the acreage from\n“Agricultural” to “General Commercial.”\n                                       The Draft EIR\n       In October 2009, the City issued a notice of preparation that an EIR would be\nprepared for the proposed Gateway II project. A draft EIR was published in April 2010.\nThe draft EIR described the scope of the project as a regional commercial center with\napproximately 808,000 square feet of retail space, 3 hotels with 100 rooms each, a 20,000\nsquare foot sit-down restaurant, 3 fast food restaurants with a cumulative 30,500 square\nfeet of space, an 80,000 square foot auto mall, and 100,000 square feet of office space.\n       The draft EIR studied Gateway II’s anticipated impact on retail in surrounding\nareas. Based on “the super-regional retail center size of Woodland Gateway Phase I and\n\n                                              4\n\fPhase II,” the draft EIR expected the project would “include customers from Woodland,\nDavis, Dixon, North Natomas, Greenbriar Specific Plan area, Colusa County, and\nunincorporated portions of Yolo County (including UC Davis and Winters).” Because\n“the specific tenant mix is unknown,” the draft EIR “evaluate[d] the retail trade area’s\nability to support the overall amount of retail rather than specific classes of retail goods.”\n       The analysis divided its assessment of impacts into “two time periods based on\nprojected market demand.” According to the draft EIR, “The phasing approach allows\nfor the Project to minimize the potential for urban decay. [¶] —- The first time period is\nbased on estimated market demand in 2015. This phase includes the first 295,000 square\nfeet of retail development and half of the auto mall (two dealerships). It is anticipated\nthis first phase will be completed by 2015. [¶] —- The second time period includes the\ncumulative project absorption through 2025. The second phase of development,\nanticipated to be completed no earlier than 2025, will include the remaining 545,000\nsquare feet of retail development, 100,000 square feet of office, hotels, and remaining\nauto dealership site.”\n                                      URBAN DECAY\n       The draft EIR engaged in “an assessment of the potential for the Project to cause\nurban decay.” To this end, the draft EIR explained that “the project must be considered\nin connection with the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future\nprojects. For example, impacts related to the physical deterioration and urban decay of\nDowntown Woodland, East of Downtown, and East of I-5.” The draft EIR noted, “urban\ndecay impacts are cumulative by nature.”\n       The draft EIR concluded Gateway II could threaten the economic health and\nphysical integrity of the City’s downtown in the near term: “Downtown Woodland . . .\ncould be directly vulnerable to a loss of sales and increased vacancies. While Project\ntenants will not compete directly with Downtown retailers, a lack of overall demand for\nadditional retail may make it financially infeasible for public or private investors to make\n\n                                              5\n\fthe needed capital improvements to support additional retail suited for Downtown. The\ndevelopment of [Gateway II] may hinder efforts to revitalize downtown in the short term.\n[¶] Over the long-term however, it is anticipated that downtown could benefit from the\nProject. As envisioned, the Project will accommodate auto dealers currently inhabiting\nkey redevelopment sites in downtown. In addition, the Project has the potential to\nincrease the number of shoppers to Woodland through increased capture of regional sales\nactivity, providing downtown with the opportunity to capture a portion of these additional\nshoppers. Finally, the Project will generate additional General Fund revenues to support\nenhanced municipal service and potential investment in downtown.”\n                                 MIXED-USE ALTERNATIVE\n       In addition to the proposed project, the draft EIR also considered a mixed-use\nalternative, which “would include development of less acreage (approximately 60 percent\nor 93 acres) than the proposed project. The Mixed Use Alternative would still include an\nannexation of 154 acres from Yolo County to the City of Woodland. The 93 acres would\nbe prezoned General Commercial (C-2) with a Planned Development Overlay to allow\nthe mixed use nature of the alternative. The remaining acreage would be prezoned to a\nnew zoning designation of Urban Reserve consistent with the General Plan. The southern\nand eastern portion of the property would remain in the existing condition, and would act\nas a buffer between the project and the [Woodland Water Pollution Control Facility]\nlocated to the east of the site, and agricultural uses to the south of the site. Development\nof this alternative would include a five-acre site for a 100-unit multi-family development\nat approximately 20 units per acre. In addition, the commercial portion of the\ndevelopment would include a local-serving commercial town center (with approximately\n50 residential units located above the center) to enhance a sense of community among\nresidents. The commercial portion of the development would include approximately\n200,000 square feet (including restaurants) and two auto dealerships. Development under\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthe Mixed-Use Alternative would be designed to be consistent with SmartGrowth\nprinciples.”3\n       The draft EIR rejected the mixed-use alternative as infeasible. As to this\nalternative, the draft EIR states that “[t]he Mixed Use Alternative would decrease the\ndevelopment of roadways, driveway, and parking areas, as compared to the proposed\nproject. . . . Transportation and circulation impacts are directly related to land\ndevelopment activities. The Mixed Use Alternative would reduce the commercial trips\ngenerated by the proposed project; however, would result in increased trips associated\nwith the proposed residential uses. Therefore, it is assumed that the transportation and\ncirculation impacts of the Mixed Use Alternative would be similar to the proposed\nproject.” (Italics added.)\n                                      ENERGY ANALYSIS\n       The draft EIR addressed the energy impact of Gateway II by determining the\nnational “average annual usage of electricity is roughly 13 kWh/square foot and the\naverage annual usage of natural gas is roughly 37 cubic feet/square foot for commercial\nbuildings.” These national averages were multiplied by the number of square feet\nexpected for Gateway II at full buildout. Thus, the draft EIR stated Gateway II “would\nbe expected to produce a demand for 10,504,000 kWh of electricity annually and\n29,896,000 cubic feet of natural gas annually.”\n       The draft EIR noted any new commercial construction would be subject to\n“[Building Code] energy conservation requirements . . . for non-residential buildings.”\nThe draft EIR also noted that “a substation, multiple utility lines (60 kV, 115 kV, and 230\nkV), and gas transmission lines exist in the area” to provide power to Gateway II. The\ndraft EIR also found the project would generate 40,051 new vehicle trips each day. Of\n\n\n\n\n3      The draft EIR does not define “SmartGrowth principles.”\n\n                                              7\n\fthese, approximately 40 percent would be regional in nature with “much longer trip\nlengths than the standard for City of Woodland retail shopping trips.”\n       Ultimately, the draft EIR concluded Gateway II “would be expected to have a less-\nthan-significant impact regarding the wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption\nof energy” and required no mitigation measures.\n                                        The Final EIR\n       The final EIR was published in June 2011. Regarding the issues raised in this\nappeal, the final EIR essentially reiterated the findings and conclusions set forth in the\ndraft EIR for the Gateway II project.\n                                         URBAN DECAY\n       The final EIR reworded language of the mitigation measures for addressing the\nimpact on urban decay expected for the project. For example, the final EIR revised\nMitigation Measure 4.11-3(a), as follows: “The City shall consider co[o]rdinateing with\nthe current owner of the County Fair Mall to consider a strategic land use plan for the\nCounty Fair Mall to analyze potential viable land uses for the site.” An explanatory note\nfollowing the revised text for the urban decay mitigation measures states, “The above\nchange is for clarification purposes only and does not alter the conclusions in the\nDraft EIR.”\n                                  MIXED-USE ALTERNATIVE\n       The final EIR reiterated the conclusions about the economic infeasibility of the\nmixed-use alternative as set forth in the draft EIR. Specifically, the final EIR again\nconcluded the mixed-use alternative would fail to “better capture leakage of sales from\nuses not already served within the community” or to “develop revenue generating land\nuses to provide jobs.”\n                                        ENERGY ANALYSIS\n       On the issue of “[i]ncreased demand for energy and impacts concerning wasteful,\ninefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy by commercial uses,” the final EIR\n\n                                              8\n\fconcluded no mitigation measures were required because the project would have less than\nsignificant impacts. The final EIR elaborates: “Increased demand for energy and\nimpacts concerning wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy by\ncommercial uses is discussed in impact statement 4.10-7, page 4.10-29 of the Draft EIR,\nChapter 4.10, Public Services and Utilities. The Draft EIR determined that project would\nbe required to comply with or exceed Title 24 guidelines and regulations. Therefore, the\nproject would be expected to have a less-than-significant impact regarding the wasteful,\ninefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy.”\n                               City Approval of Gateway II\n       In September 2011, the Woodland City Council voted three-to-two to: certify the\nfinal EIR, approve Petrovich’s application for annexation, pre-zone the project site to\n61.3 acres designated general commercial, and amend the general plan. In approving the\nproject, the City reduced Gateway II to 61.3 acres and no more than 340,000 square feet\nof commercial space.\n                                        URBAN DECAY\n       As part of its project approval, the City adopted Resolution 6029 (Resolution).\nThe Resolution acknowledges Gateway II will have a deleterious effect on the City’s\ndowntown. Specifically, the Resolution states that “[i]mplementation of the proposed\nproject would result in physical deterioration and urban decay of retail centers in\nDowntown Woodland, East of Downtown, and East of I-5.” (Italics added.) Supporting\nthis finding, the City found that “[t]he proposed project could attract new consumers to\nthe City of Woodland and minimize impacts to existing big box retailers. However,\nshould existing big box retailers relocate to the proposed project, re-leasing of the vacant\nbig box could be difficult, and urban decay could occur in the entire shopping center. In\naddition, excess of retail space (supply) would slow the revitalization of Downtown\nWoodland. As stated above, development of partial buildout of the proposed project\nwould result in short-term excess retail space (supply) and long-term retail leakage.”\n\n                                             9\n\f       Despite the findings regarding downtown urban decay, the City approved the\nproject and noted “that (l) changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated\ninto, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effects\nidentified above and (2) specific economic legal, social, technological, or other\nconsiderations make infeasible certain mitigation measures or alternatives identified in\nthe Final EIR.” To ameliorate the effects of urban decay, the Resolution stated the urban\ndecay mitigation measures set forth in the draft and final EIRs would be required.\n                                  MIXED-USE ALTERNATIVE\n       In contrast to the rationale of economic infeasibility set forth in the EIRs, the\nWoodland City Council rejected the mixed-use alternative on grounds it “would have\ngreater environmental impacts than the proposed project. (State CEQA Guidelines\n§ 15126.6(c).)” (Italics added.) As further explanation, the Resolution stated: “The\nMixed-Use Alternative would result in greater public services and utilities impacts, as\ncompared to the proposed project. Impacts to land use and agricultural resources,\nbiological resources, and hydrology and water quality would be fewer, as compared to\nthe proposed project. All other impacts would be equal to those of the proposed project.\nBecause the Mixed-Use Alternative would, overall, result in greater impacts than the\nproposed project, the Alternative is considered infeasible.”\n                                  ENERGY CONSERVATION\n       The Resolution did not mention the energy considerations set forth in the draft and\nfinal EIRs under section 4.10-7, which required compliance with building codes to\nachieve energy efficiency. Thus, no mitigation measures were adopted to address\ntransportation, construction, or operation energy impacts for Gateway II.\n                CCEC’s Petition for Writ of Mandate in Superior Court\n       In September 2011, CCEC filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court to\nchallenge the City’s certification of the final EIR and its approval of the project. In July\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f2012, the trial court denied the petition in its entirety. CCEC timely filed a notice of\nappeal from the judgment.\n       In September 2012, the trial court awarded costs to the City, with the exception of\nthe City’s request for $6,896.40 related to City staff and consultant time spent in helping\nto prepare the administrative record.4 The City has timely filed a notice of appeal from\nthe post-judgment order awarding costs to the City.\n                                   CEQA OVERVIEW\n       The basic principles of CEQA are by now familiar and well settled. “ ‘[T]he\npurpose of CEQA is to protect and maintain California’s environmental quality. With\ncertain exceptions, CEQA requires public agencies to prepare an EIR for any project they\nintend to carry out or approve whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial\nevidence that the project may have a significant environmental effect. . . .’ (Communities\nfor a Better Environment v.

Accordingly, we “resolve the substantive CEQA issues on [appeal]\nby independently determining whether the administrative record demonstrates any legal\nerror by the [lead agency] and whether it contains substantial evidence to support the\n[agency’s] factual determinations.” (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 427.) Consistent\nwith these principles of review, we proceed to consider CCEC’s contentions.\n                                   APPEAL BY CCEC\n                                             I\n\n  Whether the Project Conflicts with the City’s General Plan Goals of Preserving an\n                         Economically Viable Downtown\n       CCEC contends the City violated the requirements set forth in its general plan by\napproving Gateway II after finding it would cause urban decay in the City’s downtown.\nThe City responds that the issue has not been preserved for review to the extent it arises\nunder the planning and zoning law. Insofar as the claim arises under CEQA, the City\nargues part of the claim was not presented during the EIR process, and it fully complied\nwith CEQA requirements. We conclude the issue of urban decay is cognizable only to\nthe extent it arises under CEQA.\n       The City approved the annexation of the Gateway II acreage and its zoning change\non September 20, 2011. The City asserts that “[t]he statute of limitations under the State\nPlanning and Zoning Law therefore expired on December 19, 2011.” With this assertion,\n\n\n                                            13\n\fwe have no quarrel because Government Code section 65009, subdivision (c), provides\nthat for a challenge to a land-use zoning change “no action or proceeding shall be\nmaintained in any of the following cases by any person unless the action or proceeding is\ncommenced and service is made on the legislative body within 90 days after the\nlegislative body’s decision: [¶] (A) To attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the\ndecision of a legislative body to adopt or amend a general or specific plan.”\n       However, CCEC filed its petition for writ of mandate in superior court within the\n90-day window –- specifically, within two days after the City’s zoning action. On this\npoint, the City argues CCEC did not actually present the planning and zoning law cause\nof action in its petition. The City acknowledges CCEC presented CEQA causes of action\nand “the Petition alleges the Gateway II project was inconsistent with the City’s General\nPlan.” Nonetheless, the City asserts the zoning claim was not properly presented because\nthe petition did not present the issue as “a separate cause of action” or “alert the City to\nthe allegation that the State Planning and Zoning law had been violated.”\n       CCEC’s petition does contain the factual allegation that “a project such as this one\nwith significant and unmitigated decay impacts that would positively degrade the\ndowntown is not consistent with the General Plan.” However, CCEC’s petition is titled,\n“Petition for writ of mandate pursuant to the Environmental Quality Act.” Each of the\nthree causes of action expressly states a CEQA violation by the City for (1) erroneously\ncertifying a deficient EIR, (2) making findings in support of the project without sufficient\nevidence, and (3) failing to recirculate the final EIR to correct its deficiencies. For these\nCEQA violations, CCEC requested relief in the form of setting aside the final EIR,\ninjunctions preventing construction on the project, and a declaration that the City must\ncomply with CEQA’s EIR requirements before proceeding, and costs of suit.\n       CCEC’s petition is thoroughly steeped in CEQA and does not mention the\nplanning and zoning law. Moreover, the petition requests no relief in the form of\nrezoning or nullifying the City’s action to amend the general plan to annex the acreage\n\n                                              14\n\ffor Gateway II. We agree with the City that the petition failed to alert it that CCEC\nchallenged its actions under the planning and zoning law.\n       “Generally speaking, ‘[t]he complaint in a civil action serves a variety of purposes\n[citation], of which two are relevant here: it serves to frame and limit the issues [citation]\nand to apprise the defendant of the basis upon which the plaintiff is seeking recovery\n[citations].

Even though this case\ninvolves a petition rather than a complaint, the City is likewise entitled to be alerted to\nthe basis upon which petitioner CCEC seeks the relief for which it prays. CCEC did not\nplead any planning and zoning law violation in a manner that might have fairly apprised\nthe City of this legal theory for relief.\n       Accordingly, we conclude the claim is not cognizable insofar as it arises under the\nplanning and zoning law. Given the CEQA claim has been preserved but the planning\nand zoning law issue forfeited, the scope of our review is limited to whether the City’s\nstudy and mitigation of urban decay complied with CEQA.\n                                              II\n       Whether the City’s Urban Decay Mitigation Measures Comply with CEQA\n       In addition to challenging Gateway II on grounds it conflicts with the City’s\ngeneral plan, CCEC argues Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(a) through (d) and 4.11-3(a) do\nnot satisfy CEQA requirements. We conclude the City’s urban decay mitigation\nmeasures are inadequate under CEQA.\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f                                            A.\n                   CEQA Encompasses Urban Decay Considerations\n       Under CEQA, a lead agency must address the issue of urban decay in an EIR\nwhen a fair argument can be made that the proposed project will adversely affect the\nphysical environment. “An EIR is to disclose and analyze the direct and the reasonably\nforeseeable indirect environmental impacts of a proposed project if they are significant.\n(Guidelines, §§ 15126.2, 15064, subd. (d)(3).)[5] Economic and social impacts of\nproposed projects, therefore, are outside CEQA’s purview. When there is evidence,\nhowever, that economic and social effects caused by a project, such as a shopping center,\ncould result in a reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impact, such as urban\ndecay or deterioration, then the CEQA lead agency is obligated to assess this indirect\nenvironmental impact.” (Anderson First Coalition v.

In the draft\nEIR, the City recognized that if “existing big box retailers relocate to the proposed\nproject, re-leasing of the vacant big box could be difficult, and urban decay could occur\nin the entire shopping center. In addition, excess of retail space (supply) would slow the\nrevitalization of Downtown Woodland. . . . [D]evelopment of partial buildout of the\nproposed project would result in short-term excess retail space (supply) and long-term\nretail leakage.” To ameliorate the urban decay expected to be caused by Gateway II, the\ncity council imposed the following five mitigation measures to combat urban blight\ndowntown and at the County Fair Mall:\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a): At the time of future applications for site-specific\ndevelopment, the project applicant shall submit a request to the Community Development\nDepartment for a Master Conditional Use Permit (CUP), which must include a site plan\nand architectural review, as well as create design standards for alternative transportation,\npedestrian and bicycling access, site plans, and architecture review. The Master CUP\nshall comply with the draft EIR for the project, and will be evaluated at the time of the\nrequest to determine if further environmental review is necessary [for the] list of specific\nproject uses for review and approval by the Community Development Department. The\nMaster CUP shall indicate that the list of specific project uses shall primarily consist of\nregional retail uses that do not include entertainment uses and other uses that would\ncompete with retail in Downtown Woodland.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b): At the time of future applications for site-specific\ndevelopment, the project applicant shall submit a market study for and urban decay\nanalysis, including hotels if proposed, for review and approval by the Community\nDevelopment Department. The market study and urban decay analysis shall show that\nadequate retail demand exists for the proposed uses and that urban decay would not occur\nas a result of the proposed phase of the project. If the market study and urban decay\nanalysis show inadequate demand, then the City shall evaluate the impacts of the use\nproposed for development and either require additional mitigation or require an\nalternate use.\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(c): Prior to the issuance of building permits, the\nproject applicant shall contribute funds toward the development of a Retail Strategic\nPlan. The amount of the fee shall be determined in the Development Agreement between\nthe City and the project applicant. The City would be responsible for preparing a Retail\nStrategic Plan which shall determine what retail areas shall be preserved as retail and\nwhich areas shall be developed as other uses, helping to identify repositioning strategies\nfor those underperforming centers.\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(d): Prior to the issuance of building permits, the\nproject applicant shall contribute funds toward the preparation of an Implementation\nStrategy for the Downtown Specific Plan. The amount of the fee shall be determined in\nthe Development Agreement between the City and the project applicant. The City would\nbe responsible for preparing the Implementation Strategy which, among other things, can\nhelp define the strategies for progressing the civic and entertainment focus of downtown.\n       To address urban blight at the County Fair Mall, Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a)\nrequires the City to “coordinate with the current owner of the County Fair Mall to prepare\na strategic land use plan for the County Fair Mall to analyze potential viable land uses for\nthe site.” However, even with “[i]mplementation of Mitigation Measures 4.11-3(a) and\n4.11-3(b) [to] reduce the intensity and delay urban decay to retail in County Center Mall,\n\n                                            18\n\fWest Woodland, and East Street Corridor,” the City still anticipated that “this impact\nwould remain significant and unavoidable.”\n                                             C.\n                           Preservation of the Issue for Review\n       Before turning to the individual mitigation measures adopted to combat urban\ndecay, we address the City’s contention that CCEC failed to preserve the issue by raising\nit in the trial court. The City’s contention misreads the record.\n       Ordinarily, we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. (Hale v.\nMorgan (1978) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160324\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160324/hale-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394.) In arguing CCEC failed to raise the issue of urban\ndecay in the trial court, the City cites the portion of CCEC’s petition that alleges claims\nunder CEQA. However, that same petition devoted nearly three pages to setting forth\nallegations regarding this issue under the rubric, “Urban Decay.” Those pages clearly\narticulated the alleged inadequacies of the City’s EIRs regarding urban decay and\ndescribed how the mitigation measures fail to combat the problem. In short, the very\ndocument cited by the City dispels its claim of forfeiture.\n       In addition to arguing CCEC failed to raise the issue in the trial court, the City\nasserts CCEC did not challenge Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) during the EIR process.\n“In order to attack a decision that is subject to CEQA, the alleged grounds for\nnoncompliance must have been presented to the public agency, and the person attacking\nthe decision must have raised some objection during the administrative proceedings.

Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) limits Gateway II to consisting “primarily” of\nregional retail usage that does not include civic, entertainment, or other uses that would\ncompete with the downtown.\n\n                                             19\n\f       The City asserts CCEC failed to present the issue during the EIR process. We\nreject the assertion. Having reviewed the administrative record, we conclude specific\nobjections to Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) were raised during the EIR process. For\nexample, one City resident commented on the final EIR by objecting to “the inadequate\nand improper manner of mitigation analysis for serious impacts of urban decay caused by\nthe revised project” and stated that an “inadequate aspect of this mitigation analysis\nrelated to urban decay involves an absence of any relevant specificity of the statement\nthat commercial zoning within the revised project: ‘will primarily consist of regional\nretail uses that do not include . . . uses that would compete with Downtown Woodland.’ ”\nAdditionally, the final EIR itself notes CCEC comment: “The mitigation proposed for\nurban decay is vague and unenforceable.” Accordingly, CCEC may challenge Mitigation\nMeasure 4.11-2(a) because the issue has been preserved for our review.\n                                              D.\n                   Land Use Controls –- Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a)\n       In approving the project, the City adopted Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) to require\nPetrovich to submit “a site plan and architectural review, as well as create design\nstandards for alternative transportation, pedestrian and bicycling access, site plans, and\narchitecture review” when the developer is ready to build on specific sites within the\nproject area. The developer’s application –- along with the supporting documents –- are\nsubject to “review and approval by the Community Development Department.” If the\nCity issues a permit for the application, the permit “shall indicate that the list of specific\nproject uses shall primarily consist of regional retail uses that do not include\nentertainment uses and other uses that would compete with retail in Downtown\nWoodland.”\n       CCEC argues this mitigation measure is meaningless because even if “project uses\nshall primarily consist of regional retail uses,” up to 49 percent of Gateway II may\nconsist of uses directly competing with the City’s downtown retail area. To the extent\n\n                                              20\n\fCCEC’s argument relies on the conflict between land use for Gateway II and the City’s\n2002 general plan, it is forfeited for failure to timely present a claim under the planning\nand zoning law. (See part I, ante.) To the extent the argument arises under CEQA, we\nreject it on the merits.\n       Under CEQA, a project may be adopted even when it will have a significant and\nunavoidable adverse effect on the environment. (California Oak Foundation v. Regents\nof University of California (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277825\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277825/california-oak-foundation-v-regents-of-university-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

A lead agency may find\nthe “unmitigated effects [to be] outweighed by the project’s benefits.” (Ibid.; Guidelines,\n§ 15093.) And, each individual mitigation measure need not, by itself, be able to cure all\nsignificant impacts resulting from the project. (See, e.g., California Oak Foundation v.\nRegents of University of California, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at p. 279 [adoption of\n“several mitigation measures and continuing best practices” were cumulatively sufficient\nto protect archaeological resources at the project sites].)\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) serves to ensure that the primary retail uses for\nGateway II will be regional, i.e., the type of retail that will not directly compete with the\nCity’s smaller downtown stores. This measure does not run afoul of CEQA because it\ndoes not outright ban all retail uses that compete with the City’s downtown. There is no\nneed to require mutually exclusive retail offerings in the City’s downtown and at\nGateway II. Indeed, such mutual exclusivity might not be possible since overlapping\nproduct offerings might not be avoidable. As to this mitigation measure, we accept the\nCity’s representation that it “merely found that this measure would help, albeit not\nenough to avoid the significant urban decay impact identified by the EIR.” While\nMitigation Measure 4.11-2(a) is permissible under CEQA, it does not, by itself, constitute\nadequate mitigation of anticipated urban decay as a result of Gateway II.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f                                             E.\n                 Future Market Studies –- Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b)\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) requires Petrovich “[a]t the time of future\napplications for site-specific development,” to “submit a market study for and urban\ndecay analysis, including hotels if proposed, for review and approval by the Community\nDevelopment Department.” CCEC argues this measure conflicts with CEQA in four\nways: (1) by “piecemealing” urban decay analysis, (2) by ceding responsibility for\nstudying an environmental impact to the developer, (3) by delegating review and\napproval authority to the City’s community development department, and (4) by failing\nto require specific mitigation actions to alleviate urban decay. We agree with the second\nand fourth contentions.\n       First, Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) does not impermissibly piecemeal the analysis\nof urban decay for Gateway II. It is well settled “ ‘that CEQA forbids “piecemeal”\nreview of the significant environmental impacts of a project.’ (Berkeley [Keep Jets over\nthe Bay Committee v. Board of Port Commissioners (2001)] 91 Cal.App.4th [1344,]\n1358.) Rather, CEQA mandates ‘that environmental considerations do not become\nsubmerged by chopping a large project into many little ones —- each with a minimal\npotential impact on the environment —- which cumulatively may have disastrous\nconsequences.’ (Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1172485\"><a href=\"/opinion/1172485/bozung-v-local-agency-formation-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283–\n284.) Thus, the Guidelines define ‘project’ broadly as ‘the whole of an action, which has\na potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a\nreasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. . . .’ (Guidelines, §\n15378, subd.

(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 429.) Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b)’s\ntiering of further review for applications to build at specific sites within Gateway II does\nnot run afoul of CEQA. “Tiering is proper ‘when it helps a public agency to focus upon\nthe issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review and in order to exclude\nduplicative analysis of environmental effects examined in previous environmental impact\nreports.’ (. . . § 21093, subd.

Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) does not constitute\nimproper piecemealing because the City did not use tiering to downplay or segregate the\ncumulative impact of urban decay arising from Gateway II.\n       Second, CCEC objects to Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) on grounds the market\nstudies are to be completed by the developer. The point is well taken. Under CEQA, a\npublic agency cannot charge a developer with the responsibility to study the impact of a\nproposed project. (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137841/sundstrom-v-county-of-mendocino/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Sundstrom involved a county delegating the duty to conduct hydrology\nimpact studies for construction of a sewage treatment plant to the applicant. (Id. at p.\n307.) The Sundstrom court held CEQA did not allow delegation of “the County’s legal\nresponsibility to assess environmental impact by directing the applicant himself to\nconduct the hydrological studies subject to the approval of the Planning Commission\nstaff. Under CEQA, the EIR or negative declaration must be prepared ‘directly by, or\nunder contract to’ the lead agency. (. . . § 21082.1.) The implementing regulations\nexplicitly provide: ‘The draft EIR which is sent out for public review must reflect the\nindependent judgment of the lead agency.’ ([Guidelines] § 15084, subd.

Here, Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b) shifted the\nresponsibility to Petrovich to produce the market studies in violation of CEQA. (Ibid.)\n       Third, the Woodland City Council did not err by delegating responsibility to\nimplement this mitigation measure to its community development department. In Kleist\nv. City of Glendale (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2118244/kleist-v-city-of-glendale/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court of Appeal held a city council\ncannot delegate responsibility for considering an EIR to its planning board. (Id. at\np. 779.) Under CEQA, “the EIR must be presented to the decision making body of the\nagency.” (Sundstrom, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 307.)\n       Here, the city council did act as the decision-making authority when it reviewed\nand approved the final EIR. The city council made the required findings under CEQA\nthat Gateway II would result in significant and unavoidable urban decay impacts. In an\neffort to reduce those impacts, the city council adopted Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(b).\nShifting the responsibility to carry out the mitigation in that measure is allowed under\nCEQA. Section 21081.6, subdivision (a)(1), provides that when changes or alterations\nhave been required or incorporated into the project to mitigate or avoid the significant\neffects on the environment, the lead agency “shall adopt a reporting or monitoring\nprogram for the changes made to the project or conditions of project approval, adopted in\norder to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment. The reporting or\nmonitoring program shall be designed to ensure compliance during project\nimplementation.” Delegation of responsibility for a monitoring program is recognized by\nthis section in its requirement that the monitoring “agency shall, if so requested by the\nlead agency or a responsible agency, prepare and submit a proposed reporting or\nmonitoring program.” (Ibid.) CEQA does not require that the Woodland City Council\nitself implement urban decay mitigation measures.\n       Fourth, the market study measure does not commit the City to any specific\nmitigation action or impose any standards for determining whether it must undertake any\nfuture measures. The Resolution adopting the project provides only that “[i]f the market\n\n                                             24\n\fstudy and urban decay analysis show inadequate demand, then the City shall evaluate the\nimpacts of the use proposed for development and either require additional mitigation or\nrequire an alternate use.” Thus, the Resolution approving the project does not identify\nany specific mitigation measures nor does it provide any standards for the community\ndevelopment department to adhere to in deciding whether the developer-proposed\nmitigation is sufficient. “This is inadequate. No criteria or alternatives to be considered\nare set out. Rather, this mitigation measure does no more than require a report be\nprepared and followed, or allow approval by a county department without setting any\nstandards.” (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2281169\"><a href=\"/opinion/2281169/endangered-habitats-league-v-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794.)\n       Here, the questions of whether mitigation measures will be required, of what they\nmight consist, and how effective they will be are left unanswered. Given the City’s\nrecognition that Gateway II will cause urban decay, it was required to do more than agree\nto a future study of the problem. “An EIR is inadequate if ‘[t]he success or failure of\nmitigation efforts . . . may largely depend upon management plans that have not yet been\nformulated, and have not been subject to analysis and review within the EIR.’ (San\nJoaquin Raptor [Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007)] 149 Cal.App.4th [645,]\n670.) ‘A study conducted after approval of a project will inevitably have a diminished\ninfluence on decisionmaking. Even if the study is subject to administrative approval, it is\nanalogous to the sort of post hoc rationalization of agency actions that has been\nrepeatedly condemned in decisions construing CEQA.’ ” (Communities for a Better\nEnvironment v. City of Richmond, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 92, quoting Sundstrom,\nsupra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 307.)\n       The City argues the market study mitigation requirement has a specific\nperformance standard in that each market study will have to show there is “adequate\nretail demand for the proposed tenants at the site.” (Italics added.) A showing of\nsufficient demand for the goods sold by a particular planned tenant for Gateway II does\n\n                                             25\n\fnot address the issue of whether urban decay in downtown has been sufficiently\nalleviated. Moreover, the City’s solution to “either require additional mitigation or\nrequire an alternate use” lacks any standard to ensure sufficient abatement of\nurban decay.\n       Lacking any “criteria for success” in abating urban decay, the measure does not\nensure any actual mitigation. (See Communities for a Better Environment v. City of\nRichmond, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 93.) CEQA’s requirements are not met by\nMitigation Measure 4.11-2(b).\n\n                                             F.\n\n  Urban Decay Study and Implementation Program –- Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(c)\n                                     & (d)\n       CCEC contends Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(c) and (d) failed to commit the City\nto any feasible or enforceable mitigation measures to ameliorate the adverse effects of the\nproject on urban decay elsewhere in Woodland. The contention has merit.\n       The City adopted Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(c) to require that Petrovich\n“contribute funds toward the development of a Retail Strategic Plan. The amount of the\nfee shall be determined in the Development Agreement between the City and the project\napplicant.” Mitigation Measure 4.11-2(d) requires Petrovich to “contribute funds toward\npreparation of an Implementation Strategy for the Downtown Specific Plan.” As with the\nretail strategic plan, “[t]he amount of the fee shall be determined in the Development\nAgreement between the City and the project applicant.”\n       A draft of the development agreement in the administrative record provides that\nPetrovich “shall pay its fair share towards (a) a citywide retail strategic plan/suburban\nurban design and re-use analysis (a ‘Retail Strategic Plan’) for existing suburban retail\nstrip centers; and (b) an implementation strategy for the Downtown Specific Plan (an\n‘Implementation Strategy’). The Retail Strategic Plan shall evaluate possible re-uses,\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\finterventions, strategies, and process evaluations. The Implementation Strategy shall,\namong other things, help define the strategies for progressing the civic and entertainment\nfocus of downtown. For purposes of this Paragraph . . . [Petrovich’s] ‘fair share’ for both\nthe Retail Strategic Plan and the Implementation Strategy shall be 50% of the actual cost\nof such studies, provided that [Petrovich’s] collective share for both shall not exceed\n$45,000 in the aggregate.”\n       The call for a retail strategic plan and implementation strategy for a downtown\nspecific plan (fair share plans) appears in the draft EIR without further discussion or\nanalysis. The final EIR adopted these mitigation measures without elaboration.\nConsequently, the entirety of what can be gleaned from the record about the retail\nstrategic plan is that it is intended to “determine what retail areas shall be preserved as\nretail and which areas shall be developed as other uses, helping to identify repositioning\nstrategies for those underperforming centers.” Likewise, the only information about the\nimplementation strategy is that “among other things,” it “can help define the strategies for\nprogressing the civic and entertainment focus of downtown.”\n       These fair share fees correspond to studies that do not obligate the City to\nundertake any actual mitigation of urban decay. By their own terms, Mitigation\nMeasures 4.11-2(c) and (d) require the City only to “prepare” the fair share plans. These\nmitigation measures do not require the City to undertake any action. “A commitment to\npay fees without any evidence that mitigation will actually occur is inadequate.” (Save\nOur Peninsula, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.) Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(c) and (d)\nstand in contrast to the “CEQA require[ment] that feasible mitigation measures actually\nbe implemented as a condition of development, and not merely be adopted and then\nneglected or disregarded.” (Anderson First, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1186-1187.)\n       In Anderson First, this court considered a fair share mitigation fee program that\nrequired the proposed project to pay 16.87 percent of the estimated cost of an interstate\nhighway interchange. (130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1188.) After noting fee-based mitigation\n\n                                              27\n\fprograms may constitute adequate measures under CEQA, Anderson First cautioned that\n“[t]o be adequate, these mitigation fees, in line with the principle discussed above, must\nbe part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to\nimplementing.” (Ibid., italics added.) The mitigation measure in that case did not pass\nmuster under CEQA because it was “vague regarding ‘the program to provide [those]\nimprovements’; in staff reports, City states it [was] preparing an update to the traffic\nimpact fee program to include the I–5 interchange improvements, and note[d] that\n‘Condition 16 requires payment of the impact fee.’ ” (Id. at pp. 1188-1189.) Instead, the\nCity of Anderson was required to “make these fees part of a reasonable, enforceable plan\nor program that is sufficiently tied to the actual mitigation of the traffic impacts at issue.”\n(Id. at p. 1189.)\n       The fees in this case are more speculative than those presented in Anderson First,\nwhere the costs of the transportation improvements had been calculated and were in “no\nserious dispute.” (Anderson First, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1188.) Here, the\nadministrative record does not estimate the cost to prepare the fair share plans. More\nimportantly, the City does not estimate how much the mitigation measures or strategies\ncalled for in these plans will cost or how they might be implemented. Consequently,\nthese are the sort of speculative mitigation measures that do not comply with CEQA. (Id.\nat pp. 1188-1189.)\n       The City counters the fair share plans constitute an adequate mitigation measure to\naddress urban decay. In so arguing, the City relies on this court’s decision in Sacramento\nOld City Assn. v. City Council (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2177415\"><a href=\"/opinion/2177415/sacramento-old-city-assn-v-city-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

SOCA involved a\nchallenge to an EIR prepared for the expansion of a convention center and construction of\nan office tower. (Id. at p. 1016.) The EIR noted adverse impacts on traffic and parking,\nfor which specific mitigation measures were proposed. (Id. at pp. 1020-1022.) In\napproving the project, the City “committed itself to mitigating the impacts of parking and\ntraffic” and “approved funds for a major study of downtown transportation.” (Id. at\n\n                                              28\n\fp. 1029.)

In that case, the County of El\nDorado began allowing developers to clear oak woodlands to a greater extent than\npreviously allowed in exchange for payments to the Option B fee program. (Id. at\np. 1161.) The Option B program, however, remained sufficiently indeterminate to allow\nit to qualify as an adequate mitigation measure under CEQA. As we explained, “neither\nthe general plan nor the program EIR included the necessary details for implementing\nOption B, including specifying the fee rate, the parcels for which the fee would be\nrequired prior to development, or the uses for which the fee would be employed by the\nCounty.” (Id. at p. 1176.)\n       Mitigation fee programs may constitute adequate mitigation to address the adverse\neffects of a project. However, “ ‘to be considered adequate, a fee program at some point\nmust be reviewed under CEQA, either as a tiered review eliminating the need to replicate\nthe review for individual projects, or on a project-level, as-applied basis. . . . Because the\nfees set by the ordinance have never passed a CEQA evaluation, payment of the fee does\nnot presumptively establish full mitigation for a discretionary project.’ ” (Center for\nSierra Nevada Conservation, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1179-80, quoting California\nNative Plant Society v.

Here,\nthe City’s EIRs did not adequately assess the scope of the program or fees necessary to\nadequately address the urban decay impacts expected to result from construction of\nGateway II.\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f                                              G.\n        Urban Decay at the County Fair Mall –- Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a)\n       CCEC contends Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a) purports to alleviate expected urban\ndecay at Woodland’s County Fair Mall but does not require the City to undertake any\nactual mitigation. The point is well taken.\n       In approving Gateway II, the City acknowledged the project “would result in\nphysical deterioration and urban decay of retail centers in County Fair Mall, West\nWoodland, and East Street Corridor.” (Italics added.) Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a)\naddresses urban decay at the County Fair Mall by providing: “The City shall coordinate\nwith the current owner of the County Fair Mall to prepare a strategic land use plan for the\nCounty Fair Mall to analyze potential viable land uses for the site.” The City also\nreiterated that Mitigation Measures 4.11-2(a) through (d) would be implemented.\n       Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a) requires the City to take no action other than to\ncoordinate with the current owner to prepare a plan for viable land uses at the County\nFair Mall. Mitigation Measure 4.11-3(a) does not require actual study of this aspect of\nurban decay. Moreover, this mitigation measure does not require any action by the City\nto mitigate the urban decay it may discover to result for the County Fair Mall. Under\nCEQA, this purported mitigation measure is inadequate. (Anderson First, supra, 130\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1188-1189.)\n       At oral argument, the City argued the programmatic nature of the EIR in this case\nallows for future studies and additional mitigation to fulfill CEQA mandates. As this\ncourt has previously explained, “Under Guidelines section 15168, program EIRs are used\nfor a series of related actions that can be characterized as one large project. If a program\nEIR is sufficiently comprehensive, the lead agency may dispense with further\nenvironmental review for later activities within the program that are adequately covered\nin the program EIR. (Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).)” (Center for Sierra Nevada\nConservation, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.) Here, the programmatic nature of the\n\n                                              30\n\fCity’s EIR does not remedy the urban decay mitigation measures’ shortcomings.\nAlthough programmatic, the final EIR purported to study the project as a whole and to\nimplement sufficient mitigation measures to ameliorate the effects of urban decay. No\nfurther mitigation measures or EIR studies for the issue of urban decay are promised\nby the City.\n       Regardless of whether the City intends to conduct further tiered EIRs for parts of\nthe project, the program EIR is defective because it adopts inadequate mitigation\nmeasures for urban decay. “While proper tiering of environmental review allows an\nagency to defer analysis of certain details of later phases of long-term linked or complex\nprojects until those phases are up for approval, CEQA’s demand for meaningful\ninformation ‘is not satisfied by simply stating information will be provided in the future.’\n(Santa Clarita [Organization for Planning the Environment v. County of Los Angeles\n(2003)] 106 Cal.App.4th [715,] 723.) As the CEQA Guidelines explain: ‘Tiering does\nnot excuse the lead agency from adequately analyzing reasonably foreseeable significant\nenvironmental effects of the project and does not justify deferring such analysis to a later\ntier EIR or negative declaration.’ ([Guidelines] § 15152, subd. (b).) Tiering is properly\nused to defer analysis of environmental impacts and mitigation measures to later phases\nwhen the impacts or mitigation measures are not determined by the first-tier approval\ndecision but are specific to the later phases. For example, to evaluate or formulate\nmitigation for ‘site specific effects such as aesthetics or parking’ (id., § 15152\n[Discussion]) may be impractical when an entire large project is first approved; under\nsome circumstances analysis of such impacts might be deferred to a later tier EIR.”\n(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 431.) Having studied and attempted to mitigate the\nurban decay effects from the project as a whole, the City may not excuse inadequate\nmitigation by putting off corrective action to a future date.\n\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\f                                             H.\n                                        Conclusion\n       We conclude the City’s mitigation measures aimed at alleviating the urban decay\nexpected to result from Gateway II do not comply with CEQA. Except for Mitigation\nMeasure 4.11-2(a), we conclude the adopted mitigation measures are insufficient to\nensure the City will take concrete, measurable actions to counteract the urban decay\nexpected to result in downtown and at the County Fair Mall. As to Mitigation Measure\n4.11-2(a), even the City acknowledges it is only a partial solution to the urban decay\nimpacts identified in the draft and final EIRs. Accordingly, the City has failed to adopt\nadequate mitigation measures to address urban decay impacts as required under CEQA.\n                                             III\n                                The Mixed-use Alternative\n       CCEC contends the City failed to give meaningful consideration to project\nalternatives such as the mixed-use alternative. CCEC further argues no substantial\nevidence supports the final EIR’s conclusion the mixed-use alternative was infeasible.\nThe City counters that the issue has been largely forfeited and lacks merit in any event.\nWe conclude the issue is cognizable and CCEC’s arguments have merit.\n                                             A.\n                           Preservation of the Issue for Review\n       The City asserts CCEC forfeited claims that the draft and final EIRs did not\nproperly study traffic or air quality impacts of the mixed-use alternative. While the City\nacknowledges CCEC challenged the lack of consideration given to the mixed-use\nalternative, it asserts there were no comments made that specifically addressed traffic\nimpacts, air quality impacts, or the economic feasibility of the mixed-use alternative. We\nreject the City’s assertion of forfeiture. A cursory review of the draft and final EIRs\nshows these issues were repeatedly raised.\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\f       As to traffic impacts associated with the mixed-use alternative, the final EIR\nexpressly acknowledges a comment letter that urged consideration of project alternatives\non grounds that “[r]ecent studies show that appropriate design of transportation systems\ncan reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from new commercial development up to 66%\nby including mitigation such as transportation demand management, bike and pedestrian\nfriendly facilities, parking supply management, density, transit proximity, and mixed\nuse.” Another commenter complained that “[t]he traffic impacts of the project are\ndifficult to overstate.” This commenter noted the increased number of trips expected;\nmitigation measures such as light-rail, other modes of public transportation, bicycle and\npedestrian-friendly measures, and parking incentives. Citations to traffic studies were\noffered to help formulate effective mitigation measures. Contrary to the City’s assertion,\nthe issue of traffic impacts associated with the project and project alternatives was\ndiscussed during the comment phase of the EIR process.\n       So too, air quality impacts –- including concerns about greenhouse gas emissions\n–- were the subject of numerous comments during the EIR process. Concerns about\ndegradation of air quality as a result of the project were raised during the EIR process. In\nparticular, the Yolo County Board of Supervisors commented that the City was required\n“to identify, quantify, and mitigate for climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions,” but issued a draft EIR that “does not discuss any of these issues.” The board\nof supervisors further asserted: “The [draft EIR] concludes that the proposed 1.1 million\nsquare foot retail and auto mall is consistent with all recommended measures intended to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a close examination of Tables 4.3-15 and\n4.3-16 [in the draft EIR] indicates that most of the ‘consistency’ claims are based on\nmitigation measures that require future studies or plans that will be prepared and applied\nto the project either ‘prior to issuance of grading permits’ or ‘at the time of submittal of\nthe detailed development plans for Planning Commission review.’ [¶] As one example,\nboth tables cite Mitigation Measure 4.3-2, which requires the applicant to submit a GHG\n\n                                              33\n\freduction strategy that ‘shall describe in text and on the site plan’ how nine very broad\nstandards will be implemented. The standards include such guidance as ‘reuse and\nrecycle construction and demolition waste’ and ‘create water-efficient landscapes.’\nHowever, no details on how compliance will be achieved and/or no specific approval\nprocedures for future phasing are required to ensure that the measures will achieve GHG\nreduction.” Nonetheless, the final EIR concluded that “[t]he City has imposed all\nfeasible mitigation to reduce air quality impacts of the project.” Regardless of the\ncorrectness of the final EIR’s conclusion, it is clear the issue of air quality impacts was\nraised as part of the EIR process.\n       As to the economic viability of the mixed-use alternative, CCEC argued during the\nEIR process: “The City should reject as inadequate the basis provided in the EIR for\nrejecting the Mixed-Use Alternative and the Reduced Intensity Alternative. It is clear\nthat both of these as well as alternative commercial sites along the rail corridor provide\nfeasible alternatives that would reduce impacts while meeting project objectives. [¶] The\nattempted justification for the adverse environmental impacts is not adequate. The EIR\nstates that the project is intended to prevent ‘leakage of sales,’ but this term is never\ndefined or explained. In particular there is no explanation of why it is necessary to build\na commercial center that serves four counties in order to prevent ‘leakage of sales’ from\nthe City of Woodland.” CCEC’s critique of the “leakage of sales” rationale used by the\nCity to dismiss the mixed-use alternative was included in its briefing in the trial court.\nAccordingly, the issue of whether economic infeasibility served as a basis for rejecting\nthe mixed-use alternative has been preserved for our review.\n                                              B.\n          CEQA Requires the Lead Agency to Consider Feasible Alternatives\n       The California Supreme Court has explained, “CEQA’s substantive mandate that\npublic agencies refrain from approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives\nor mitigation measures is effectuated in section 21081. (See City of Poway [v. City of\n\n                                              34\n\fSan Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d [1037,] 1045–1046.) Under this provision, a\ndecisionmaking agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant\nenvironmental effects have been identified unless it makes specific findings about\nalternatives and mitigation measures.

It would\nconsist of 200,000 square feet of commercial development (including restaurants), two\n\n                                              35\n\fauto dealerships, and a “five acre site for a 100-unit multi-family development at\napproximately 20 units per acre.” This alternative would also include “a local-serving\ncommercial town center (with approximately 50 residential units located above the\ncenter) to enhance a sense of community among residents.”\n       The draft EIR rejected the reduced-intensity alternative and mixed-use alternative\non the grounds of economic infeasibility. It concluded, “these alternatives would not\nmeet the following project objectives related to economic feasibility: [¶] 1) Facilitate the\ndevelopment of a regional retail center to better capture leakage of sales from uses not\nalready served within the community; and [¶] [(2)] Develop revenue generating land\nuses to provide jobs and capture regional retail leakage.”\n       As to the environmental impacts of the mixed-use alternative, the draft EIR\nassumed similarity with Gateway II as proposed. The draft EIR explains: “The Mixed\nUse Alternative would decrease the development of roadways, driveway, and parking\nareas, as compared to the proposed project. . . . Transportation and circulation impacts\nare directly related to land development activities. The Mixed Use Alternative would\nreduce the commercial trips generated by the proposed project; however, would result in\nincreased trips associated with the proposed residential uses. Therefore, it is assumed\nthat the transportation and circulation impacts of the Mixed Use Alternative would be\nsimilar to the proposed project.” (Italics added.)\n       The draft EIR contains no evidence the mixed-use alternative would have similar\nor greater environmental impacts than the project as proposed by Petrovich. In the final\nEIR, the City asserted that “[t]he draft EIR included analysis of a Mixed-Use Alternative\nwhich would result in fewer impacts related to physical deterioration and urban decay.”\n       In approving Gateway II, the City did not reject the mixed-use alternative on\ngrounds of economic infeasibility as set forth in the draft EIR. Instead, the City declared:\n“For the reasons set forth below in the Supporting Explanation, the City Council rejects\nthe Mixed Use Alternative because (1) it is infeasible and ([2]) because the Mixed-Use\n\n                                             36\n\fAlternative would have greater environmental impacts than the proposed project. (State\nCEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(c).) . . . [¶] Supporting Explanation: The Mixed-Use\nAlternative would result in greater public services and utilities impacts, as compared to\nthe proposed project. Impacts to land use and agricultural resources, biological\nresources, and hydrology and water quality would be fewer, as compared to the proposed\nproject. All other impacts would be equal to those of the proposed project. Because the\nMixed-Use Alternative would, overall, result in greater impacts than the proposed\nproject, the Alternative is considered infeasible. (Draft EIR, pp. 6-11 to 6-15.)” The\nCity’s conclusion about environmental impacts was also in the final EIR, which noted\nthis alternative would have “fewer impacts related to physical deterioration and\nurban decay.”\n       Gateway II, as approved, significantly scaled back the scope of the project to 61.3\nacres of “General Commercial” development. However, the City did not explain how the\nmixed-use alternative could be deemed economically infeasible with only 93 acres of\ndevelopment (comprising 200,000 square feet of future commercial development in\naddition to five acres of residential housing units) when the approved project consists of\nonly 61.3 acres (comprising “up to 340,000 square feet of future commercial\ndevelopment”).\n                                            D.\n                         Feasibility of the Mixed-use Alternative\n       Although the draft and final EIRs rejected the mixed-use alternative on grounds of\neconomic infeasibility, the City approved the project on grounds the mixed-use\nalternative was environmentally inferior. The City did not acknowledge it switched from\nthe rationale of “economic infeasibility” due to “leakage of sales” to one of “greater\nenvironmental impacts” as the ground for rejecting the mixed-use alternative. The\nadministrative record does not indicate the City discovered additional information\nshowing the mixed-use alternative to be an inferior environmental alternative.\n\n                                            37\n\f       The City attempts to explain its shift by asserting that “[t]he determination in the\nEIR that the Mixed-Use Alternative failed to meet project objectives was the opinion of\nthe City’s EIR consultants.” (Italics changed.) The City continues that “[a]s such, the\nfeasibility conclusions in the EIR were not binding on the City Council, and the Council\nhad discretion to reach conclusions that differed from those in the EIR.” We disagree.\n       The City adopted a rationale unsupported by its EIR analysis. The City’s\nunexplained switch from a rationale of economic infeasibility to environmental inferiority\nas the basis for rejecting the mixed-use alternative conflicts with CEQA’s requirement to\n“disclose ‘the “analytic route the . . . agency traveled from evidence to action” ’ . . . .”\n(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 445, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Ass’n v.\nRegents of University of California (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161804\"><a href=\"/opinion/1161804/laurel-heights-improv-v-regents-of-univ-of-calif/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (Laurel Heights I).) Here,\nthe City’s administrative process sheds no light on how it came to reject the mixed-use\nalternative based on environmental inferiority instead of economic infeasibility in the\ndraft and final EIRs. Consequently, the City has failed to comply with CEQA in\nrejecting the mixed-use alternative on grounds of environmental inferiority to the project\nas approved.\n                                              IV\n\nWhether the Final EIR Failed to Properly Identify and Analyze Potentially Significant\n                    Energy Impacts Resulting from Gateway II\n       CCEC argues the City’s EIRs did not properly analyze or mitigate the potentially\nsignificant energy impacts generated by Gateway II. We agree.\n                                              A.\n                                     Issue Preservation\n       The City asserts CCEC forfeited its contentions regarding energy impacts because\nCCEC did not cite Appendix F during the EIR process. Appendix F of the CEQA\nGuidelines requires that projects assess the energy impacts of a project when a fair\n\n\n\n                                              38\n\fargument can be made that the project will have significant environmental impact. (See\npart IV C., post [examining Appendix F].) We disagree.\n       CCEC was not required to cite specific sections of the CEQA Guidelines to\npreserve the issue of energy impacts for review. “This is because ‘ “[i]n administrative\nproceedings, [parties] generally are not represented by counsel. To hold such parties to\nknowledge of the technical rules of evidence and to the penalty of waiver for failure to\nmake a timely and specific objection would be unfair to them.” (Note (1964) Hastings\nL.J. 369, 371.) It is no hardship, however, to require a layman to make known what facts\nare contested.’ (Kirby v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd.

Under the rubric “Energy Impacts,” CCEC commented:\n“The EIR should contain a cumulative evaluation of the energy impacts that would be\ninvolved in the construction and operation of the center. For example, project\nimplementation would involve building pads, roads, and appurtenant improvements.\nThis construction requires energy including diesel fuel. Additional energy is required for\nthe construction of structures. [¶] The energy impacts of future project operation should\nbe evaluated. The operation of commercial buildings requires electricity and natural gas\nfor space heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, water heating, equipment operation,\nmaintenance, etc. The cumulative impacts on energy supplies and energy-efficient\ndesign alternatives should be evaluated.”\n       Also during the EIR process, CCEC addressed its concerns about transportation\nenergy impacts. CCEC commented: “Direct and indirect energy impacts should be\nevaluated including energy that would be consumed in the construction and operation of\nthe required transportation infrastructure and in the manufacture, operation, and\nmaintenance of on-road vehicles.”\n\n                                            39\n\f       Consequently, the City’s assertion that the issue of transportation energy was not\naddressed during the administrative process lacks merit. CCEC included its energy\nimpact concerns in its briefing on the issue in the trial court. Thus, CCEC has preserved\nthe issue of energy impacts for review.\n                                             B.\n                           The City’s Energy Impacts Analysis\n       The entirety of the City’s energy impacts analysis for Gateway II comprises less\nthan a page in the draft EIR.6 In pertinent part, the draft EIR states: “Based upon reports\n\n\n6      Upon reviewing the record, it appears the EIRs and the Resolution required a\nnumber of measures that would likely have the collateral effect of substantial energy-\nsaving effects. However, these directives are adopted under the rubric of reducing\n“overall project-generated emissions of ozone-precursor pollutants by approximately\n15 percent.” (Italics added.) Given that these measures address ozone-precursor\npollutants rather than energy impacts, it is understandable that the City does not rely on\nMitigation Measure 4.3-2 in defending the adequacy of the proposed energy saving\nmitigation measures.\n\n        Mitigation Measure 4.3-2 appears to require Petrovich to “[d]esign buildings to be\nenergy efficient. Site buildings to take advantage of shade, prevailing winds, landscaping\nand sun screens to reduce energy use. [¶] Install efficient lighting and lighting control\nsystems. Daylight should be used as an integral part of lighting systems in buildings,\nsufficient to provide lighting for 75 percent of interior work spaces of proposed buildings.\n[¶] Install light colored ‘cool’ roofs and pavements (i.e., high reflectance, high emittance\nroof surfaces, or exceptionally high reflectance and low emittance surfaces) and\nstrategically placed shade trees. [¶] Install energy efficient heating and cooling systems,\nappliances and equipment, and control systems. [¶] Install light emitting diodes (LEDs)\nfor traffic, street, and other outdoor lighting. [¶] Limit the hours of operation of outdoor\nlighting. [¶] Provide the necessary facilities and infrastructure to encourage the use of\nlow or zero-emission vehicles (e.g., electric vehicle charging facilities and conveniently\nlocated alternative fueling stations) and public transit into project design. [¶] Include\ninternal pedestrian and bicycle routes that connect to adjacent pedestrian and bicycle\nroutes; as well as, transit stops located either onsite or along adjacent roadways. Create\ntravel routes that ensure that destinations may be reached conveniently by public\ntransportation, bicycling or walking. [¶] Promote ridesharing programs (e.g., by\ndesignating a certain percentage of parking spaces for ride sharing, designating adequate·\npassenger loading and unloading and waiting areas for ride sharing vehicles). [¶] Plant\n\n                                             40\n\fand data provided by the California Energy Commission and the Energy Information\nAdministration of the USDOE, the average annual usage of electricity is roughly 13\nkWh/square foot and the average annual usage of natural gas is roughly 37 cubic\nfeet/square foot for commercial buildings. Based upon these figures the proposed project\nwould be expected to produce a demand for 10,504,000 kWh of electricity annually and\n29,896,000 cubic feet of natural gas annually.\n       “The [Building Code] energy conservation requirements for non-residential\nbuildings would be applied. . . . [¶] Pursuant to the [Building Code] and the Energy\nEfficiency Standards, the City of Woodland would review the design components of the\nenergy efficiency and conservation measures as specific plans are submitted. In addition,\na substation, multiple utility lines (60 kV, 115 kV, and 230 kV), and gas transmission\nlines exist in the area to serve the buildout of the proposed project.\n       “The proposed project would be subject to the above-identified reviews to ensure\nthat the project complies with (or exceeds) Title 24 guidelines and regulations.\nTherefore, although the project would result in an increased demand for energy, the\nproposed project would be expected to have a less-than-significant impact regarding the\nwasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy.\n\n\nand maintain trees to help shade hardscape parking and pedestrian surfaces.

[¶]\nBuilding equipment should be Energy-Star rated to the extent applicable. [¶] Design on-\nsite structures to exceed California Title 24 energy conservation requirements.”\n\n       Although there is likely to be a high correlation between reducing greenhouse\nemissions and energy savings, this court cannot assume the overlap is sufficient under\nCEQA’s study and mitigation requirements. As CCEC correctly observes, “Air quality\nmitigation is not a substitute for an energy analysis.” Thus, we will not consider\nMitigation Measure 4.3-2 in our discussion of mitigation measures addressing energy\nimpacts.\n\n                                              41\n\f       “Mitigation Measure(s) [¶] None required.”\n       The City’s final EIR adopted the draft EIR’s analysis without substantive change.\n                                             C.\n                          Appendix F to the CEQA Guidelines\n       Under CEQA, an EIR is “fatally defective” when it fails “to include a detailed\nstatement setting forth the mitigation measures proposed to reduce wasteful, inefficient,\nand unnecessary consumption of energy.” (People v. County of Kern (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106522\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106522/people-v-county-of-kern/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774.) The requirement to adopt energy impact mitigation measures “is\nsubstantive and not procedural in nature and was enacted for the purpose of requiring the\nlead agencies to focus upon the energy problem in the preparation of the final EIR.” (Id.\nat p. 774.) However, “lead agencies have not consistently included such analysis in their\nEIRs.” (Cal. Natural Resources Agency, Final Statement of Reason for Regulatory\nAction: Amendments to the State CEQA Guidelines Addressing Analysis and Mitigation\nof Greenhouse Gas Emissions Pursuant to SB97 (Dec. 2009), p. 71.) For this reason, the\nCalifornia Natural Resources Agency amended Appendix F to the CEQA Guidelines in\n2009 “to ensure that lead agencies comply with the substantive directive in section\n21100(b)(3).”7 (People v. County of Kern, supra, at p. 774.)\n       Appendix F of the Guidelines declares that “[t]he goal of conserving energy\nimplies the wise and efficient use of energy.” (Guidelines, app. F, § (I).) To this end,\nAppendix F notes that “[t]he means of achieving this goal include: [¶] (1) decreasing\noverall per capita energy consumption, [¶] (2) decreasing reliance on fossil fuels such as\ncoal, natural gas and oil, and [¶] (3) increasing reliance on renewable energy sources.”\n\n\n\n\n7      Section 21100, subdivision (b), provides than an EIR “shall include a detailed\nstatement setting forth all of the following: [¶] . . . [¶] (3) Mitigation measures proposed\nto minimize significant effects on the environment, including, but not limited to,\nmeasures to reduce the wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of energy.”\n\n                                             42\n\f(Ibid.) Thus, Appendix F provides that “[p]otentially significant energy implications of a\nproject shall be considered in an EIR to the extent relevant and applicable to the project.”\n(Id. at § II.) Among the factors to be considered, if applicable to the project, are\n“[p]otential measures to reduce wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary consumption of\nenergy during construction, operation, maintenance and/or removal” including\n“[a]lternate fuels (particularly renewable ones) or energy systems.” (Id. at § (D)(4).)\n                                             D.\n                           The City’s Energy Impacts Analysis\n                            1. Transportation Energy Impacts\n       Appendix F states that environmental impacts subject to the EIR process include\n“[t]he project’s projected transportation energy use requirements and its overall use of\nefficient transportation alternatives.” (Guidelines, app. F, subd. (II)(C)(6).) Here, the\nCity’s draft EIR anticipated Gateway II would generate up to 40,051 new vehicle trips\neach day. Of these, 40 percent of the trips were expected to originate outside the city.\nNonetheless, the City concluded the energy impacts from the project would be less than\nsignificant. In so concluding, the City’s energy impacts analysis did not address the\ntransportation energy impacts of the project.\n       On appeal, the City does not deny its EIRs did not assess transportation energy\nimpacts. Instead, the City argues its reduction of the size of the project as approved\nnecessarily means some of the transportation energy impact was mitigated. The City also\nasserts it has mitigation measures designed to reduce vehicle trips. Of course, the City\ncannot say how much less transportation energy is needed for the project as approved\nbecause the issue has never been assessed in an EIR. CEQA EIR requirements are not\nsatisfied by saying an environmental impact is something less than some previously\nunknown amount. (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 445; Laurel Heights I, supra, 47\nCal.3d at p. 404)\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f       We conclude the City’s EIR analysis is deficient insofar as it does not assess or\nconsider mitigation for transportation energy impacts of the project.\n                     2. Construction and Operational Energy Impacts\n       Appendix F states that when relevant to a project, an EIR should consider:\n“Energy consuming equipment and processes which will be used during construction,\noperation and/or removal of the project. If appropriate, this discussion should consider\nthe energy intensiveness of materials and equipment required for the project.”\n(Guidelines, app. F, subd. (II)(A)(1), italics added.) Further, Appendix F notes an EIR\nshould consider whether the project involves “Unavoidable Adverse Effect” such as\n“wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary consumption of energy during the project\nconstruction, operation, maintenance and/or removal that cannot be feasibly mitigated.”\n(Id. at subd. (II)(F).)\n       In approving Gateway II, the City found that requiring Petrovich to comply with\nthe Building Code sufficed to address energy impact concerns for the project. “California\nbuilding standards are contained in title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.\n(International Assn. of Plumbing etc. Officials v. California Building Stds. Com.

City of\nTracy (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2275706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2275706/tracy-first-v-city-of-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 932 (Tracy First).) Although the Building Code\napplies to all nonresidential buildings, it does not extend beyond the buildings\nthemselves. It addresses the building’s envelope, exterior lighting, and signage.\n(Building Code, § 100, subd. (b) & Table 100-A, [“Application of Standards”].) Thus,\nthe Building Code sets forth minimum efficiency requirements for air-conditioning,\nheating, windows, roofs, and insulation. (Building Code, §§ 112, 116, 118, 123.)\n       Although the Building Code addresses energy savings for components of a new\ncommercial construction, it does not address many of the considerations required under\nAppendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. These considerations include whether a building\n\n                                            44\n\fshould be constructed at all, how large it should be, where it should be located, whether it\nshould incorporate renewable energy resources, or anything else external to the building’s\nenvelope. Here, a requirement that Gateway II comply with the Building Code does not,\nby itself, constitute an adequate assessment of mitigation measures that can be taken to\naddress the energy impacts during construction and operation of the project.\n         The City asserts that, in addition to the Building Code, the “[p]roject must also\ncomply with [CALGreen], which contains further requirements for energy conservation\nin new construction.” CALGreen took effect on January 1, 2011. (Cal. Building\nStandards Com. (2010) Cal. Green Building Standards Code: CALGreen, p. i.) As it\napplies to nonresidential new construction, CALGreen is intended to provide guidance on\n“planning, design and development methods that include environmentally responsible site\nselection, building design, building siting and development to protect, restore and\nenhance the environmental quality of the site and respect the integrity of adjacent\nproperties.” (CALGreen, § 5.101.) As the draft EIR noted, CALGreen sets forth such\nrequirements as a 20 percent reduction in indoor water use, separate water meters for\nnonresidential buildings, diversion of construction waste from landfills, energy systems\ninspections for buildings larger than 10,000 square feet, and low-pollutant interior finish\nmaterials.\n         Like the Building Code, CALGreen does not address construction and operational\nenergy impacts for a project intended to transform agricultural land into a regional\ncommercial shopping center. (See CALGreen, §§ 5.201.1-5.508.) Moreover, CALGreen\ndoes not address transportation energy impacts for a project such as Gateway II. (See\nibid.)\n         We also reject the City’s reliance on Tracy First, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2275706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2275706/tracy-first-v-city-of-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Tracy First at p. 916.) The City of Tracy’s EIR\nincluded 17 pages discussing energy issues and 8 pages discussing energy impacts. The\n\n                                              45\n\fEIR concluded no mitigation measures were required because there was no significant\nenergy impact. (Id. at pp. 930-931.) On appeal, Tracy First made “an argument with\nrespect to the EIR’s reliance on the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards that\n[was] difficult to comprehend.” (Id. at p. 933.) The Tracy First court concluded, as to\nthe “argument that it is improper to rely on state building standards in determining\nwhether an energy impact is significant, we disagree. CEQA requires ‘[m]itigation\nmeasures proposed to minimize significant effects on the environment, including, but not\nlimited to, measures to reduce the wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of\nenergy.’ (. . . § 21100, subd. (b)(3).) The California Building Energy Efficiency\nStandards are meant to promote energy efficiency, as the name implies. In other words,\nthey ‘reduce the wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of energy.’\n[Citation.] Other than arguing that reliance on the building standards is not enough,\nTracy First makes no argument concerning what more the EIR should have done.”\n(Tracy First, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at pp. 933-934, italics added.) Ultimately, with\nrespect to energy impacts, the Tracy First court held Tracy First had failed to show that\nthe City of Tracy prejudicially abused its discretion based on lack of substantial evidence.\n(Id. at p. 936.)\n       Here, unlike Tracy First, the City did not properly assess the construction and\noperational energy impacts of Gateway II. Tellingly, the City concedes the draft EIR\n“did not consider the potential energy impacts associated with the additional square\nfootage of [uses other than the 808,000 square feet of retail space] assumed at buildout.”\nThus, the City acknowledges it did not study the construction or operational energy\nimpacts of three hotels, a 20,000 square foot restaurant, three fast food restaurants, an\nauto mall, and 100,000 square feet of office space. Although the City characterized the\nomission as nonprejudicial, the failure to study the energy impacts resulting from a large\npart of the planned construction is not inconsequential. “ ‘ The error is prejudicial “if the\nfailure to include relevant information precludes informed decisionmaking and informed\n\n                                             46\n\fpublic participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process.” ’ (San\nJoaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 721–722.)” (Save Our Peninsula, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 118.) Thus, we reject\nCity’s assertion it would have approved the project regardless of what a proper energy\nimpacts analysis would have been. We conclude the City’s EIRs were inadequate\nbecause they lacked a discussion or analysis of the energy impacts of the project.\n                              3. Renewable Energy Impacts\n       The introduction to Appendix F states that its goals include “increasing reliance on\nrenewable energy sources.” (Guidelines, app. F, subd. (I)(3).) Appendix F further states\nthat “Mitigation Measures may include: [¶] . . . [¶] 4. Alternate fuels (particularly\nrenewable ones) or energy systems.” (Id. at subd. (II)(D)(4).) Nonetheless, the City’s\nEIRs for Gateway II do not indicate any investigation into renewable energy options that\nmight be available or appropriate for the project.\n       The City responds that it “was not required to incorporate any renewable energy\nfeatures suggested by [CCEC] in order to reduce renewable energy features.” This\nassertion misses the point of CCEC’s claim under CEQA: the City’s EIRs omit any\ndiscussion or analysis of renewable energy options for Gateway II. CEQA is violated\nwhen an EIR contains no discussion of a potentially significant environmental\nconsideration. (California Oak Foundation v.

Our conclusion that the\nCity erred in several respects under CEQA necessitates remand and renders any\ndetermination of costs to the prevailing party premature.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is reversed, and the matter remanded to the trial court to grant\nCalifornia Clean Energy Committee’s petition for writ of mandate on grounds (1) the\nCity of Woodland’s urban decay mitigation measures are insufficient under the California\nEnvironmental Quality Act, (2) the final environmental impact report violates the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act by not properly assessing the feasibility of the\nmixed-use alternative, and the City of Woodland’s rationale for rejecting the mixed-use\nalternative is not supported by substantial evidence in its environmental impact reports,\nand (3) the City of Woodland did not properly assess transportation, construction, and\noperational energy impacts in its environmental impact reports.\n       The trial court shall vacate the award of costs to the City of Woodland as the\nprevailing party and shall retain jurisdiction over this action by way of a return to the writ\nof mandate demonstrating the City of Woodland has rescinded its final environmental\nimpact report certification and project approval, after which the City of Woodland shall\nexercise its independent judgment as to how to proceed.
