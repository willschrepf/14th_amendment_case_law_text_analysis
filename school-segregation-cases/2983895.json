TONE JOHNSON, JR., ET AL.,                                              Appellees.\n\n\n                  On appeal from the 319th District Court of\n                          Nueces County, Texas.\n\n\n                         MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n    Before Chief Justice Valdez and Justices Yañez and Benavides\n            Memorandum Opinion by Chief Justice Valdez\n\n      Appellants, Linda Gallegos, Celia G. Ramon, and Melissa Salaiz, appeal a summary\n\njudgment granted in favor of appellees, Dr. Tone Johnson Jr.; Tone Johnson Jr., M.D. P.A.;\n\nComplete Medical Care; Bay Area Care Center, Inc.; Medifast Weight Reduction Center;\n\fCorpus Christi Regional Center for Addictions, Inc.; Corpus Christi Bay Management\n\nGroup, Inc.; Coastal Cities, Inc.; and E&B Medical Association, P.A.1 By four issues, which\n\nwe categorize as two, appellants argue that the trial court erred by: (1) granting summary\n\njudgment even though material fact issues exist; and (2) holding that appellants failed to\n\nexhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit. We affirm, in part, and reverse and\n\nremand, in part.\n\n                                              I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz began working with Dr. Johnson at Complete Medical\n\nCare in August 2003, April 2003, and May 2002, respectively. In complaints filed with the\n\nCorpus Christi Human Relations Commission (“CCHRC”) and the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) in January and February 2004, appellants each alleged\n\nthat they were constructively discharged in October 2003.\n\n        Appellants filed their original petition against appellees on December 12, 2003, and\n\ntheir first amended petition on June 21, 2004. In their first amended petition, appellants\n\nasserted claims against appellees for: (1) wrongful discharge and retaliation under chapter\n\n21 of the labor code, see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . §§ 21.051-.106 (Vernon 2006); (2) hostile\n\nwork environment and sexual harassment,2 see id. § 21.051; (3) intentional infliction of\n\n\n         1\n           E&B Medical Association, P.A. does business as Com plete Medical Care; therefore, we will refer\nto the com bined entity as Com plete Medical Care.\n\n        2\n           Sexual harassm ent is a form of sex discrim ination prohibited by section 21.051 of the labor code.\nSee T EX . L ABO R C OD E A N N . § 21.051 (Vernon 2006); Syndex Corp. v. Dean, 820 S.W .2d 869, 871 (Tex.\nApp.–Austin 1991, writ denied) (citing Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986)); see also\nDel Mar College Dist. v. Vela, 218 S.W .3d 856, 860 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 2007, no pet.). Furtherm ore,\nthe law recognizes two form s of sexual harassm ent claim s: quid pro quo and hostile work environm ent. Del\nMar College Dist., 218 S.W .3d at 860 (citing Garcia v. Schwab, 967 S.W .2d 883, 885 (Tex. App.–Corpus\nChristi 1998, no pet.) (discussing hostile work environm ent as a form of sexual harassm ent); Ewald v. W ornick\nFam ily Foods Corp., 878 S.W .2d 653, 659 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 1994, writ denied) (setting out the\nelem ents of a hostile work environm ent claim )).\n                                                       2\n\femotional distress; (4) assault against Dr. Johnson individually and against the remaining\n\nappellees under agency theory; and (5) negligent supervision. Appellees answered with\n\na general denial and asserted various affirmative defenses, including: (1) an assertion that\n\nseveral defendants were “non-employing” entities and that several entities that were sued\n\nare no longer in existence3; (2) appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies\n\nunder chapter 21 of the labor code, see id. §§ 21.201-.211 (Vernon 2006); and (3)\n\nappellants’ claims are time-barred.\n\n         On May 12, 2006, appellees filed a hybrid motion for summary judgment, advancing\n\nboth traditional and no-evidence grounds. Appellants filed a response to appellees’\n\nsummary judgment motions, supplied the trial court with affidavits and deposition tesitmony\n\nof Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz, and filed a motion for continuance requesting more time\n\nto complete discovery.4 Appellees objected to appellants’ response and moved the trial\n\n\n         3\n         In particular, appellees noted that appellants were not em ployed at any tim e by “Dr. Tone Johnson,\nTone Johnson, M.D.[,] P.A[.], Bay Area Care Center, Inc., Medifast W eight Reduction Center, Corpus Christi\nRegional Center for Addictions, Inc., Corpus Christi Bay Managem ent Group, Inc., and Coastal Cities, Inc.”\nAppellees further noted that Tone Johnson M.D., P.A. is a non-existent entity and Medifast W eight Reduction\nCenter and Corpus Christi Bay M anagem ent are no longer in existence. Moreover, appellants, in their\nappellate brief, adm it that they do not seek review of the sum m ary judgm ent granted in favor of\n“Defendants/Appellees Tone Johnson [Jr.], M.D., P.A.[;] Bay Area Care Center, Inc.[;] Medifast W eight\nReduction Center[;] Corpus C hristi Regional Center for Addictions, Inc.[;] Corpus Christi Bay Managem ent\nGroup, Inc.[;] and Coastal Cities, Inc.” because these entities “were not em ployers of Plaintiffs/Appellants.”\n\n         4\n             Appellees argue on appeal that appellants’ response was untim ely because it was allegedly filed less\nthan seven days before the sum m ary judgm ent hearing and appellants failed to file a m otion for leave. See\nT EX . R. C IV . P. 166a(c) (“Except on leave of court, the adverse party, not later than seven days prior to the day\nof hearing m ay file and serve opposing affidavits or other written response.”). The record reflects that\nappellants filed their response in the trial court on May 31, 2006, yet the certificate of service indicates that\nappellees received notice of the response on May 30, 2006. The trial court’s sum m ary judgm ent order states\nthat: “The Court, after considering Defendants’ Motion and Plaintiffs’ reply thereto, is of the opinion that\nDefendants’ Motion has m erit and should in all things be GRANTED.” (Em phasis added.) Therefore, it is\nclear that the trial court considered appellants’ response, and in doing so, the trial court ostensibly granted\nappellants leave to file their response. See Speck v. First Evangelical Lutheran Church of Houston, 235\nS.W .3d 811, 815 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) (“Sum m ary judgm ent evidence m ay be filed\nlate, but only with leave of court. W here nothing appears in the record to indicate that the trial court granted\nleave to file the sum m ary judgm ent response late, we presum e that the trial court did not consider the\nresponse.”); see also Benchmark Bank v. Crowder, 919 S.W .2d 657, 663 (Tex. 1996); INA of Tex. v. Bryant,\n686 S.W .2d 614, 615 (Tex. 1985).\n                                                         3\n\fcourt to strike appellants’ summary judgment evidence because appellants allegedly failed\n\nto direct the trial court to specific portions of the attached deposition testimony that may\n\nhave created a fact issue and precluded summary judgment.\n\n        On June 5, 2006, the trial court conducted a hearing on appellees’ motions for\n\nsummary judgment and appellants’ motion for continuance. Appellants’ counsel was\n\nunable to personally attend the hearing, so the trial court arranged for him to make\n\narguments telephonically. At that time, appellants re-urged their motion for continuance,\n\nwhich the trial court subsequently denied. After hearing arguments, the trial court took the\n\nmatter under advisement.\n\n        On June 15, 2007, the trial court, after considering appellees’ motions, appellants’\n\nresponse, and evidence submitted by both parties, granted appellees’ motions for\n\nsummary judgment without specifying a rationale and ordered that appellants take\n\nnothing.5 See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 206 (Tex. 2001) (holding that\n\na summary judgment order is final and appealable if it (1) actually disposes of all claims\n\nand parties, or (2) clearly indicates the trial court’s intent to render a final judgment). This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The standard of review for the grant of a motion for summary judgment is\n\ndetermined by whether the motion was brought on no-evidence or traditional grounds. See\n\n\n        5\n           Specifically, the trial court noted in its order that “the Motion[s] for Sum m ary of Defendants is\nGRANTED . . . Plaintiff’s causes of action against Defendants are hereby DISMISSED, and . . . Plaintiffs take\nnothing from defendants . . . .” Neither party argues that the trial court’s judgm ent is not final; therefore, that\nissue is not before us. See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W .3d 191, 206 (Tex. 2001) (“But if the language\nof the order is clear and unequivocal, it m ust be given effect despite any other indications that one or m ore\nparties did not intend for the judgm ent to be final. An express adjudication of all parties and claim s is not\ninterlocutory m erely because the record does not afford a legal basis for the adjudication. In those\ncircum stances, the order m ust be appealed and reversed.”).\n                                                         4\n\fTEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(c), (i); see also Ortega v. City Nat’l Bank, 97 S.W.3d 765, 771 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.). A no-evidence summary judgment is equivalent to a\n\npre-trial directed verdict, and we apply the same legal sufficiency standard on review.\n\nMack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex. 2006); Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772.\n\nIn an appeal of a no-evidence summary judgment, we review the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-movant, disregarding all contrary evidence and inferences. City of\n\nKeller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 825 (Tex. 2005) (noting that the review of a no-evidence\n\nmotion for summary judgment is effectively restricted to the evidence contrary to the\n\nmotion); see Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. If the non-movant produces evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is improper. TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(i).\n\n       In responding to the movant’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment, all that\n\nis required of the non-movant is to produce a scintilla of probative evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact. See Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. “Less than a scintilla of\n\nevidence exists when the evidence is ‘so weak as to do no more than create a mere\n\nsurmise or suspicion of a fact.’” Id. (quoting Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc., 650 S.W.2d 61,\n\n63 (Tex. 1983)). Conversely, more than a scintilla exists when the evidence “rises to a\n\nlevel that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.”\n\nId. (citing Transp. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 25 (Tex. 1994)). The burden of\n\nproducing evidence is entirely on the non-movant; the movant has no burden to attach any\n\nevidence to the motion. TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(i). Furthermore, we may not consider any\n\nevidence presented by the movant unless it creates a fact question. Binur v. Jacobo, 135\n\nS.W.3d 646, 651 (Tex. 2004); Newkumet v. Allen, 230 S.W.3d 518, 521 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Eastland 2007, no pet.).\n\n\n                                            5\n\f       On the other hand, we review the trial court’s granting of a traditional motion for\n\nsummary judgment de novo. See Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d\n\n211, 215 (Tex. 2003); Branton v. Wood, 100 S.W.3d 645, 646 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi\n\n2003, no pet.). When reviewing a traditional summary judgment, we must determine\n\nwhether the movant met its burden to establish that no genuine issue of material fact exists\n\nand that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see\n\nSw. Elec. Power Co. v. Grant, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2002); City of Houston v. Clear\n\nCreek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex. 1979). The movant bears the burden of\n\nproof in a traditional motion for summary judgment, and all doubts about the existence of\n\na genuine issue of material fact are resolved against the movant. See Sw. Elec. Power\n\nCo., 73 S.W.3d at 215. We take as true all evidence favorable to the non-movant, and we\n\nindulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the non-movant’s favor. See\n\nValence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005).\n\n       We will affirm a traditional summary judgment only if the record establishes that the\n\nmovant has conclusively proved its defense as a matter of law or if the movant has\n\nnegated at least one essential element of the plaintiff’s cause of action. IHS Cedars\n\nTreatment Ctr. of Desoto, Tex., Inc. v. Mason, 143 S.W.3d 794, 798 (Tex. 2004); see Am.\n\nTobacco Co. v. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997); Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589\n\nS.W.2d at 678. A matter is conclusively established if reasonable people could not differ\n\nas to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 816.\n\nOnly when the movant has produced sufficient evidence to establish its right to summary\n\njudgment does the burden shift to the non-movant to come forward with competent\n\ncontroverting evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the element\n\n\n                                             6\n\fchallenged by the defendant. Rhone-Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Tex.\n\n1999); see Centeq Realty, Inc. v. Siegler, 899 S.W.2d 195, 197 (Tex. 1995). A defendant\n\nseeking summary judgment on an affirmative defense must conclusively prove all the\n\nelements of the affirmative defense. Steel, 997 S.W.2d at 223; see TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(b),\n\n(c).   Thus, the defendant-movant must present summary judgment evidence that\n\nestablishes each element of the affirmative defense as a matter of law. Ryland Group, Inc.\n\nv. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 121 (Tex. 1996).\n\n       Furthermore, when the trial court’s judgment does not specify which of several\n\ngrounds proposed was dispositive, we affirm on any ground offered that has merit and was\n\npreserved for review. See Joe v. Two Thirty Nine J.V., 145 S.W.3d 150, 157 (Tex. 2004).\n\n                                                III. ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Appellants’ Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claims and Challenges\n       to the Trial Court’s Summary Judgment\n\n       At the outset of our analysis, we note that appellants admit in their appellate brief\n\nthat they “do not seek review of the summary judgment in favor of Defendants/Appellees\n\nTone Johnson, M.D., P.A., Bay Area Care Center, Inc., Medifast Weight Reduction Center,\n\nCorpus Christi Regional Center for Addictions, Inc., Corpus Christi Bay Management\n\nGroup, Inc., and Coastal Cities, Inc.” Therefore, we affirm summary judgment as to those\n\ndefendants.6 See Adams v. First Nat’l Bank of Bells/Savoy, 154 S.W.3d 859, 875 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Dallas 2005, no pet.) (“It is also possible to challenge a summary judgment by\n\nseparate points of error, but a reviewing court will affirm the summary judgment as to a\n\nparticular claim if an appellant does not present argument challenging all grounds on which\n\nthe summary judgment could have been granted.”) (citing Malooly Bros., Inc. v. Napier, 461\n\n       6\n           As a result, the rem aining parties are Dr. Johnson, individually, and Com plete Medical Care.\n                                                      7\n\fS.W.2d 119, 121 (Tex. 1970); Smith v. Tilton, 3 S.W.3d 77, 83 (Tex. App.–Dallas 1999, no\n\npet.)).\n\n          We further note that neither Dr. Johnson nor Complete Medical Care moved for\n\nsummary judgment as to appellants’ claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nTherefore, without addressing the merits of appellants’ intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claims, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of appellees as to those claims. See Wright v. Sydow, 173 S.W.3d 534, 554 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied) (stating that “[a] trial court can enter a\n\nsummary judgment only against those claims attacked in a motion for summary judgment”)\n\n(citing McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 342 (Tex. 1993)).\n\n          We now turn to appellants’ challenge of the summary judgment granted in favor of\n\nDr. Johnson and Complete Medical Care.\n\nB.        Appellants’ Claims Against Dr. Johnson\n\n          By their first issue, appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Dr. Johnson because their summary judgment evidence, including\n\naffidavits and deposition testimony attached to their response, raised a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact, thereby precluding summary judgment. Specifically, appellants argue that\n\nthe attached affidavits and deposition testimony raised a material fact issue as to their\n\nclaims of assault against Dr. Johnson.7 Appellees counter that appellants’ summary\n\njudgment evidence is insufficient to raise a material fact issue because appellants failed\n\nto specifically designate and reference portions of their deposition testimony they relied\n\nupon in their response to appellees’ summary judgment motions. Appellees also argue\n\n          7\n            Except for their assault and intentional infliction of em otional distress claim s, appellants concede\nall of their rem aining claim s against Dr. Johnson.\n                                                        8\n\fthat appellants’ summary judgment evidence failed to establish that Dr. Johnson “made\n\nphysical contact with the Plaintiffs’ person” or, in other words, assaulted appellants.\n\n       1.     Applicable Law\n\n       “To establish a prima facie claim for civil assault, the plaintiff must establish the\n\nsame elements required for criminal assault.” Johnson v. Davis, 178 S.W.3d 230, 240\n\n(Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (citing Moore’s Inc. v. Garcia, 604\n\nS.W.2d 261, 264 (Tex. Civ. App.–Corpus Christi 1980, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).            Section\n\n22.01(a)(2)-(3) of the penal code provides that a person commits an assault if he\n\nintentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another when the person knows or\n\nshould reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative\n\nor intentionally or knowingly threatens another with imminent bodily injury. TEX . PENAL\n\nCODE ANN . § 22.01(a)(2)-(3) (Vernon Supp. 2009); see Johnson, 178 S.W.3d at 240.\n\n       2.     Discussion\n\n       In the present case, appellees moved for a no-evidence summary judgment on\n\nappellants’ assault claims as to Dr. Johnson; therefore, appellants had the burden to\n\nprovide competent summary judgment evidence raising a material fact issue. See TEX . R.\n\nCIV . P. 166a(i); see also Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. A review of the summary judgment\n\nevidence in the record reveals that Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz each offered deposition\n\ntestimony that Dr. Johnson made offensive contact with them. Gallegos testified that Dr.\n\nJohnson: (1) tried to grab her on numerous occasions; (2) tried to kiss her and stick his\n\ntongue in her ear; (3) grabbed her in the breast area; (4) repeatedly forced her to lean\n\nagainst him; (5) hugged her waist; and (6) played with her hair, all while expressing that he\n\nwanted to have sex with her. Ramon stated that Dr. Johnson attempted to grab her every\n\n\n                                             9\n\ftime she walked by him, which occurred many times a day, and made numerous obscene\n\ngestures to her with his mouth. Salaiz testified that Dr. Johnson: (1) put his arm around\n\nher while he was opening the door to a patient’s room; (2) pushed her against the wall and\n\nasked, “What do you think I’m going to do to you . . . .”; and (3) grabbed her hand and\n\nmoved his finger in a circular motion, which she interpreted to mean that he wanted to have\n\nsex with her. Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz each noted that the contact or attempted\n\ncontact made by Dr. Johnson was offensive and unwanted. Viewing this evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-movant, we cannot say that Dr. Johnson was entitled to a\n\nno-evidence summary judgment.\n\n        However, in the trial court and on appeal, appellees argued that appellants’\n\nsummary judgment evidence was insufficient because appellants failed to direct the trial\n\ncourt to portions of their summary judgment evidence that demonstrated that Dr. Johnson\n\nassaulted appellants. Relying heavily on the supreme court’s decision in Rogers v. Ricane\n\nEnterprises, Inc., 772 S.W.2d 76, 81 (Tex. 1989), and the Houston First Court of Appeals’\n\ndecision in Guthrie v. Suiter, 934 S.W.2d 820, 826-27 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1996,\n\nno writ), appellees assert that appellants’ failure to offer the trial court specific citations to\n\nappellants’ deposition testimony in their response to appellees’ summary judgment motion\n\nrendered appellants’ deposition testimony insufficient to raise a material fact issue.8 We\n\ndisagree and find the cases cited by appellee to be distinguishable.\n         8\n           Appellees cite to num erous other cases in support of their contention that sum m ary judgm ent was\nproper because appellants failed to specifically direct the trial court to portions of their sum m ary judgm ent\nevidence. However, we do not find any of the cases cited by appellees to be persuasive in this m atter\nbecause each are either prem ised on a finding that the underlying sum m ary judgment record is volum inous,\nwhich we do not believe is the case here, are unpublished opinions without precedential value, or are\ninapposite considering the specific circum stances in this case.

The Rogers court stated that appellant’s summary judgment\n\nmotion “does no more than refer to whatever may have been ‘on file.’ Such a general\n\nreference to a voluminous record which does not direct the trial court and parties to the\n\nevidence on which the movant relies is insufficient.” Id. As a result, the Rogers court\n\nconcluded that appellant’s summary judgment motion could not be sustained on the basis\n\nof the referenced deposition. Id. Here, appellants are not asserting entitlement to\n\nsummary judgment; instead, appellants had a summary judgment rendered against them.\n\nTexas courts have held for nearly fifty years that the purpose of summary judgment is to\n\neliminate “patently unmeritorious claims or untenable defenses,” not to “deprive litigants\n\nof their rights to a full hearing on the merits of any real issue of fact.” Gulbenkian v. Penn,\n\n151 Tex. 412, 252 S.W.2d 929, 931 (1952); see Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at\n\n678 n.5; Taub v. Aquila Sw. Pipeline Corp., 93 S.W.3d 451, 462 (Tex. App.–Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2002, no pet.); see also Martinez v. Wilson Plaza Assocs., L.P., No. 13-02-697-CV,\n\n2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 9804, at *9 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi Nov. 4, 2004, no pet.) (op.\n\non reh’g). Therefore, it makes sense that the supreme court would hold that a summary\n\njudgment movant’s failure to specifically reference portions of their summary judgment\n\nevidence precludes summary judgment, because in holding otherwise, the non-movant\n\nwould not have received adequate notice of the movant’s reliance on the deposition not\n\ncontained in the record, and thus, the non-movant would be deprived of their right to a full\n\nhearing on the merits.\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       In Guthrie, the Houston First Court of Appeals considered a situation where the\n\nproponent of the evidence attached a 500-page deposition to his response to a motion for\n\nsummary judgment. See Guthrie, 934 S.W.2d at 825. In his response, the proponent\n\nfailed to make any reference to the deposition, and the trial court refused to consider the\n\ndeposition as summary judgment evidence. See id. at 826. The court of appeals affirmed\n\nthe trial court’s decision, reasoning that “the trial court should not be compelled to sift\n\nthrough a 500-page deposition to search for evidence supporting the contestants’\n\ncontentions.” Id. In arriving at its holding, the court of appeals relied on the Texas\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in Rogers that general references to a voluminous record do not\n\ndirect trial courts and parties to evidence on which the movant relies. See 772 S.W.2d at\n\n81.\n\n       In the case at bar, appellants did not attach a “voluminous” record to their response\n\nto appellees’ summary judgment motions. Appellants’ summary judgment evidence was\n\ncomprised of approximately 185 pages of deposition testimony, which was condensed to\n\nthirty-three pages (double-sided) of actual testimony. The testimony itself was rife with\n\naccusations of sexual misconduct, harassment, and other indiscretions allegedly\n\ncommitted by Dr. Johnson. A mere cursory review of the deposition testimony would have\n\ninformed the trial court and appellees of the various allegations of misconduct involving Dr.\n\nJohnson; thus, the relevance of the depositions was readily ascertainable. Moreover,\n\nappellants’ response clearly referenced the deposition testimony, noted that the testimony\n\nestablished questions of fact as to appellants’ underlying assault and intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress claims against all defendants, and included affidavits from appellants\n\nclearly stating Dr. Johnson’s alleged transgressions and how those transgressions caused\n\n\n                                             12\n\fappellants’ injuries. Therefore, because the record was not voluminous in this case, and\n\nbecause appellants clearly referenced their summary judgment evidence and noted that\n\nthe summary judgment evidence raised issues of material fact regarding the underlying\n\nassault and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, we do not believe this\n\nsituation to be akin to the situations in Rogers and Guthrie.\n\n       Appellants cite to the El Paso Court of Appeals’ holding in Barraza v. Eureka\n\nCompany and the Austin Court of Appeals’ holding in Hinojosa v. Columbia/St. David’s\n\nHealthcare System, L.P. to support their contention that the trial court erred in refusing to\n\nconsider their deposition testimony and concluding that a material fact issue existed as to\n\ntheir assault claims against Dr. Johnson. See Barraza v. Eureka Co., 25 S.W.3d 225, 228-\n\n29 (Tex. App.–El Paso 2000, pet. denied); see also Hinojosa v. Columbia/St. David’s\n\nHealthcare Sys., L.P., 106 S.W.3d 380, 387-88 (Tex. App.–Austin 2003, no pet.).\n\n       In Barraza, the court of appeals addressed a similar issue as in the instant case\n\ninvolving a hybrid motion for summary judgment and a non-movant’s response and noted\n\nthe following:\n\n       Eureka contends that “in order to meet requirements of Rule 166a(d), Texas\n       Courts have consistently held that the party is required to identify the specific\n       evidence in the deposition on which it relies. . . .” Under Eureka’s\n       interpretation of the rule, the trial court can disregard all evidence the\n       proponent does not specifically bring to the attention of the court. We do not\n       believe this is the meaning of the rule.\n\n              Rule 166a(d) provides three methods to present unfiled discovery\n       before the trial court. First, a party may file the discovery with the trial court.\n       Second, a party may file an appendix containing the evidence. Finally, a\n       party may simply file a notice with specific references to the unfiled\n       discovery. Nowhere does the rule require that the proponent of the evidence\n       provide specific references to the discovery, if the actual documents are\n       before the trial court, in order for the trial court to consider it. The Texas\n       Supreme Court has held that the “notice of intent” requirement is fulfilled\n       when the proponent attaches copies of the discovery to its motion and the\n                                               13\n\f       motion clearly relies on the attached discovery as support. . . .\n\n25 S.W.3d at 228-29 (emphasis added).\n\n       In Hinojosa, the court of appeals addressed a traditional motion for partial summary\n\njudgment granted in favor of a hospital, physician, and the physician’s practice group in a\n\nsituation involving the death of a baby during the labor and delivery process. 106 S.W.3d\n\nat 382. Appellants claimed that a material fact issue existed as to their underlying wrongful\n\ndeath and survival statute claims because, among the evidence produced at the summary\n\njudgment proceedings, was a death certificate that demonstrated that the baby was born\n\nalive and survived for twenty minutes. Id. at 384, 386-87. Appellees argued that the death\n\ncertificate, though attached to appellants’ response to appellees’ summary judgment\n\nmotion, was insufficient to raise a fact issue because the response did “not specifically rely\n\non the death certificate’s statutory significance.” Id. at 387. In sustaining appellants’ issue\n\nand reversing the trial court’s summary judgment, the court of appeals noted the following:\n\n       Appellees’ position confuses the requirement that all issues be raised in a\n       motion before the trial court with an assessment of all the evidence produced\n       in the summary-judgment proceedings. An issue is a proposition specifically\n       addressed to the cause of action or claim that, if found to be true, directly\n       requires that summary judgment be either granted or denied. Issues must\n       be set out specifically in a motion, answer, or other response. Evidence, on\n       the other hand, comprises the documents and other materials included in the\n       record that tend to make the proposition at issue more or less probable. A\n       non-movant need not set out the exact evidence on which it relies or explain\n       with specificity how this evidence supports the issues it raises; summary\n       judgment is not a trial by affidavit or deposition. Evidence need only be\n       referenced or attached in order for a court to consider it.\n\nId. at 387-88 (emphasis added and citations omitted).\n\n       In this case, we agree with the proposition that rule 166a(d) only required appellants\n\nto reference evidence attached to their response to the summary judgment, especially\n\nconsidering appellants’ summary judgment evidence is not voluminous. See Barraza, 25\n                                        14\n\fS.W.3d at 228-29; see also Hinojosa, 106 S.W.3d at 387-88. As previously noted,\n\nappellants’ response clearly referenced the deposition testimony of Gallegos, Ramon, and\n\nSalaiz as evidence raising a fact issue and precluding summary judgment as to whether\n\nDr. Johnson assaulted appellants, and the trial court indicated in its summary judgment\n\norder that it considered appellants’ response. Furthermore, in reviewing appellants’\n\ndeposition testimony, we find numerous factual allegations of assault against Dr. Johnson\n\nthat would defeat appellees’ summary judgment motion; it is clear to us that the trial court\n\ngranted appellees’ summary judgment motion as to appellants’ assault claims merely\n\nbecause appellants did not include specific references to the summary judgment evidence\n\nthat were to the trial court’s liking. We do not believe that appellants should be deprived\n\nof their right to a full hearing on the merits of their case based on a technicality given that\n\nthe underlying summary judgment record is not voluminous. We conclude that appellants’\n\ndeposition testimony was properly before the trial court and effectively raised a material\n\nfact issue precluding summary judgment as to appellants’ assault claims against Dr.\n\nJohnson. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see also Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. Therefore, we\n\nfurther conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nappellees as to appellants’ assault claims against Dr. Johnson. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(i);\n\nsee also Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. Accordingly, we sustain appellants’ first issue as it\n\npertains to appellants’ claims of assault against Dr. Johnson.\n\nC.     Appellants’ Claims against Complete Medical Care\n\n       Also in their first issue, appellants argue that the deposition testimony of Gallegos,\n\nRamon, and Salaiz raise a fact issue as to their claims against Complete Medical Care for\n\nretaliation, aiding or abetting discrimination, sex discrimination, assault under the doctrine\n\n\n                                              15\n\fof respondeat superior, and negligent supervision.9 Appellees assert that appellants’\n\nsummary judgment evidence did not raise a material fact issue precluding summary\n\njudgment.\n\n        1.       Complete Medical Care’s Liability for Assault\n\n        In their first amended petition, appellants asserted an assault claim against\n\nComplete Medical Care under an agency theory. Appellees, in their no-evidence summary\n\njudgment motion, argued that the record contains “no evidence that any of the Defendants\n\nmade physical contact with the Plaintiffs’ person.” The supreme court has noted the\n\nfollowing regarding an employer’s liability for assaults committed by its employees:\n\n        Generally, a master is vicariously liable for the torts of its servants committed\n        in the course and scope of their employment. See Houston Transit Co. v.\n        Felder, 146 Tex. 428, 208 S.W.2d 880, 881 (1948). While we have stated\n        that “it is not ordinarily within the scope of a servant’s authority to commit an\n        assault on a third person,” see Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Hagenloh, 151 Tex.\n        191, 247 S.W.2d 236, 239 (1952), exceptions may exist where the assault,\n        although not specifically authorized by the employer, is closely connected\n        with the servant’s authorized duties, such as where a security guard uses\n        more force than is necessary in protecting the employer’s property. Id.\n\nMedina v. Herrera, 927 S.W.2d 597, 601 (Tex. 1996). “An employee’s tortious conduct is\n\n\n        9\n           In reviewing the pleadings, we find that appellants did not plead a cause of action for aiding or\nabetting discrim ination, and appellants’ claim s for retaliation and sex discrim ination were brought under the\nTexas Com m ission on Hum an Rights Act (“TCHRA”). See T EX . L ABO R C OD E A N N . §§ 21.051, 21.055 (Vernon\n2006). W ith respect to the purported “aiding and abetting discrim ination” claim , we note that Texas courts\nhave held that the purpose of pleadings is to give an adversary notice of claim s and defenses, as well as\nnotice of the relief sought. Herrington v. Sandcastle Condo. Ass’n, 222 S.W .3d 99, 102 (Tex. App.–Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.) (citing Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W .3d 887, 896 (Tex. 2000);\nPerez v. Briercroft Serv. Corp., 809 S.W .2d 216, 218 (Tex. 1991)). In addition, a trial court cannot enter\njudgm ent on a theory of recovery not sufficiently set forth in the pleadings or otherwise tried by consent. Id.\n(citing T EX . R. C IV . P. 301; Miller v. Towne Servs., Inc., 665 S.W .2d 143, 147 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.]\n1983, no writ)). The doctrine of im plied consent is intended to cover the “exceptional case” in which the record\nas a whole clearly shows the parties tried the unpleaded issue. Id. (citing Greene v. Young, 174 S.W .3d 291,\n301 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied)). The record before us indicates that the “aiding and\nabetting discrim ination” issue was first raised in appellees’ m otions for sum m ary judgm ent. Appellants did\nnot even address this claim in their response. Therefore, we cannot say that the record reflects that the\nparties tried the unpleaded “aiding and abetting discrim ination” issue by consent. As such, we need not\naddress this claim . W ith respect to appellants’ rem aining retaliation and sex discrim ination claim s that were\nproperly pleaded, we will discuss them later in this opinion. See infra Part (C)(3).\n                                                       16\n\fwithin the scope of employment when that conduct is of the same general nature as that\n\nauthorized or incidental to the conduct authorized.” Wrenn v. G.A.T.X. Logistics, Inc., 73\n\nS.W.3d 489, 494 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 2002, no pet.) “If the act is done within the\n\ngeneral authority of the employee, an employer is liable for the acts of his employee, even\n\nif the act is contrary to express orders.” Id.\n\n        It is well-settled that an employer generally cannot be held vicariously liable for the\n\nintentional torts of assault or battery perpetrated by an employee because such acts are\n\nnot typically within the course and scope of an employee’s authority or employment. Id.;\n\nsee Andrews v. Houston Lighting & Power, 820 S.W.2d 411, 413 (Tex. App.–Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied) (“Therefore, an employer is not liable for actions that an\n\nemployee takes in his own interest and not to further the purpose of carrying out the\n\nmaster’s business.”); see also Viking v. Circle K Convenience Stores, Inc., 742 S.W.2d\n\n732, 734 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ denied) (“It is not within the scope of a\n\nservant’s authority to commit an assault, which is generally an expression of personal\n\nanimosity.”). However, “[i]ntentional torts committed in the accomplishment of a duty\n\nentrusted to the employee, rather than because of personal animosity, may render the\n\nemployer liable.” Wrenn, 73 S.W.3d at 494; see GTE Sw., Inc. v. Bruce, 998 S.W.2d 605,\n\n618 (Tex. 1999) (holding an employer vicariously liable for regular and daily pattern of\n\nverbal abuse, humiliation, and terror by supervisor as “management style”).\n\n        The record reflects that Dr. Johnson is the co-owner10 of Complete Medical Care\n\nand seems to suggest that he exercised some supervisory authority over appellants’ work.\n\nAppellants offered deposition testimony that Dr. Johnson regularly harassed them,\n\n\n        10\n           The other co-owner of Com plete Medical Care is Orel Michael Everett, M.D. He is not a party to\nthis appeal.\n                                                   17\n\finappropriately touched them, and expressed his desire to have sex with them during an\n\nordinary business day at the office. Appellant allege that Dr. Johnson engaged in these\n\nactions within the scope of his position as appellants’ supervisor. Furthermore, Gallegos,\n\nRamon, and Salaiz each testified that Dr. Johnson was present at their interviews and was\n\nthe individual who had hired them and directed their job duties.\n\n      The supreme court has held that businesses may be liable for damages for torts\n\ncommitted by vice-principals. Hammerly Oaks, Inc. v. Edwards, 958 S.W.2d 387, 391-92\n\n(Tex. 1997); see Fort Worth Elevators Co. v. Russell, 123 Tex. 128, 70 S.W.2d 397, 406\n\n(1934), disapproved in part on other grounds by Wright v. Gifford-Hill & Co., 725 S.W.2d\n\n712, 714 (Tex. 1987) (holding that when action taken by a vice-principal of a corporation,\n\nthose acts may be deemed to be the acts of the corporation itself). A vice-principal\n\n“represents the corporation in its corporate capacity, and includes persons who have\n\nauthority to employ, direct, and dischage servants of the master, and those to whom a\n\nmaster has confided the management of the whole or a department or division of his\n\nbusiness.” Bruce, 998 S.W.2d at 618 (citing Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917,\n\n922 (Tex. 1998)). At the very least, appellants’ summary judgment evidence raises a\n\nmaterial fact issue as to whether: (1) Dr. Johnson’s alleged conduct was committed in the\n\naccomplishment of a duty entrusted to him or because of personal animosity; or (2) Dr.\n\nJohnson, as co-owner of Complete Medical Care, was a vice-principal and, therefore,\n\nliability for his actions was imputed to the business. We therefore conclude that the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment as to appellants’ claims against Complete\n\nMedical Care for assault under agency theory.\n\n      2.     Negligent Supervision\n\n\n                                            18\n\f       In their first amended petition, appellants also raised a claim for negligent\n\nsupervision against Complete Medical Care. In their no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment, appellees alleged that the record contains no evidence that Complete Medical\n\nCare failed to supervise its employees. However, appellants did not even reference their\n\nnegligent supervision claim in their response to appellees’ no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment, much less assert that their summary judgment evidence raised a\n\nmaterial fact issue as to their negligent supervision claim. As noted earlier, appellants\n\nwere required to specifically set out their issues in their response. See Hinojosa, 106\n\nS.W.3d at 387 (stating that an issue “is a proposition specifically addressed to a cause of\n\naction or claim that, if found to be true, directly required that summary judgment be either\n\ngranted or denied” and that “[i]ssues must be set out specifically in a motion, answer, or\n\nother response”). By their failing to do so, we cannot say that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment as to appellants’ negligent supervision claim.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we sustain appellants’ first issue as it pertains to their\n\nassault claim against Complete Medical Care; we overrule appellants’ first issue as it\n\nrelates to appellants’ negligent supervision claim against Complete Medical Care.\n\nD.     Appellants’ Claims Brought Under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\n       Act (“TCHRA”)\n\n       By their second issue, appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to their retaliation and sex discrimination claims that were brought\n\nunder the TCHRA. In particular, appellants argue that the trial court erred in concluding\n\nthat they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to these claims. Appellees\n\nassert that appellants did not properly exhaust their administrative remedies before filing\n\nsuit on their TCHRA claims; therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary\n                                            19\n\fjudgment.\n\n       1.     The TCHRA\n\n       The TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051. Specifically, section\n\n21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n       discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\n       compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n              (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n       employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\n       of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\n       status of an employee.\n\nId. The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who: “(1) opposes discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files\n\na complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation,\n\nproceeding, or hearing.” Id. § 21.055. Because one of the purposes of the TCHRA is to\n\ncorrelate state law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination, we may look\n\nto federal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA. See id. § 21.001 (Vernon 2006);\n\nsee also M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 24 (Tex. 2000);\n\nNME Hosps., Inc. v. Rennels, 994 S.W.2d 142, 144 (Tex. 1999).\n\n2.     Discussion\n\n       Appellees contended in their traditional motion for summary judgment that\n\nappellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to their TCHRA\n                                             20\n\fclaims. Specifically, appellees argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nbecause appellants filed suit before filing a complaint or charge of discrimination with the\n\nproper commission. See TEX . LABOR CODE ANN . § 21.201. In support of their motion,\n\nappellees attached: (1) appellants’ first amended petition, which was filed on June 21,\n\n2004; (2) Gallegos’s charge of discrimination filed with the CCHRC and the EEOC on\n\nJanuary 24, 2004; (3) Ramon’s charge of discrimination filed with the CCHRC and the\n\nEEOC on January 24, 2004; and (4) Salaiz’s charge of discrimination filed with the CCHRC\n\nand the EEOC on February 11, 2004. On appeal, appellees direct us to appellants’ original\n\npetition filed on December 12, 2003, to support their contention that appellants improperly\n\nfiled suit before filing their administrative complaint or exhausting their administrative\n\nremedies. Moreover, appellees argued in their summary judgment motion and on appeal\n\nthat appellants’ failure to obtain a right-to-sue letter from the CCHRC and the EEOC\n\nconstitutes a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.\n\n        Before filing suit against an employer in state court, an employee must exhaust his\n\nor her administrative remedies by first filing a complaint with the Texas Commission on\n\nHuman Rights (the “Commission”) within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act. See\n\nTEX . LABOR CODE ANN . § 21.202(a); see also Schroeder v. Tex. Iron Works, Inc., 813\n\nS.W.2d 483, 485 (Tex. 1991); Vela v. Waco Indep. Sch. Dist., 69 S.W.3d 695, 700 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Waco 2002, pet. withdrawn).11 In order to comply with the exhaustion requirement,\n        11\n             The W aco Court of Appeals in Vela v. W aco Independent School District stated that:\n\n        [E]xhaustion of the adm inistrative review system outlined above is a m andatory prerequisite\n        to filing a civil action alleging violations of the [T]CHRA. The Court stated that the [T]CHRA\n        does not provide an ‘unconditional private right of action.’ Therefore, a com plainant’s failure\n        to file a com plaint and pursue his adm inistrative rem edies with the Com m ission creates a\n        jurisdictional bar to his statutory discrim ination claim . The Suprem e Court’s decision in\n        Schroeder suggests that the legislature intended for the [T]CHRA to be the exclusive forum\n        for the resolution of an em ployee’s discrim ination claim .\n\n69 S.W .3d 695, 700 (Tex. App.–W aco 2002, pet. withdrawn) (citations om itted).\n                                                      21\n\fan employee must: (1) file a complaint with the Commission within 180 days of the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory act; (2) allow the Commission to dismiss the complaint or resolve the\n\ncomplaint within 180 days before filing suit; and (3) file suit no later than two years after the\n\ncomplaint is filed. See TEX . LABOR CODE ANN . §§ 21.201-.202, 21.208, 21.256 (Vernon\n\n2006).\n\n         The exhaustion requirement is satisfied when appellant is entitled to receive a right-\n\nto-sue letter.    See Rice v. Russell-Stanley, L.P., 131 S.W.3d 512, 510, 512 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Waco 2004, pet. denied) (stating that the “right-to-sue letter is merely notice of the\n\nexhaustion of remedies and does not constitute part of actually exhausting administrative\n\nremedies” and “mere possession of a right-to-sue letter is not mandatory before filing suit”\n\nand holding that “it is the entitlement to the right-to-sue letter that exhausts the\n\ncomplainant’s administrative remedies”); City of Houston v. Fletcher, 63 S.W.3d 920, 923\n\n(Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (same); see also Bernard v. Browning-Ferris\n\nServs., Inc., No. 01-92-00134-CV, 1994 Tex. App. LEXIS 2541, at *8 (Tex. App.–Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] Oct. 20, 1994, no writ) (op. on reh’g) (not designated for publication) (same)\n\n(citing Perdue v. Roy Stone Transfer Corp., 690 F.2d 1091,1093 (4th Cir. 1982)). “A\n\nplaintiff is entitled to a right-to-sue letter by the mere passage of 180 days after filing a\n\ntimely, sworn, written complaint with the Commission.” Fletcher, 63 S.W.3d at 923 (citing\n\nTEX . LABOR CODE ANN . § 21.208).\n\n         In the present case, appellants noted in their administrative complaints that they\n\ntook issue with the facts surrounding their constructive discharge occurring on or about\n\nOctober 17, 2003. Thus, appellants timely filed their complaints within 180 days of the\n\nalleged discriminatory act. See id. § 21.202(a); Rice, 131 S.W.3d at 513; Schroeder, 813\n\n\n                                               22\n\fS.W.2d at 485-86; see also Donna Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, No. 13-09-00185-CV,\n\n2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 7324, at **8-9 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi Sept. 17, 2009, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.) (“When a charge is timely filed as to one act of discrimination, the ‘continuing\n\nviolation’ doctrine expands the scope of those discriminatory events that are actionable,\n\nas long as one of the events occurs within the 180-day period.”) (citing Wal-Mart Stores v.\n\nDavis, 979 S.W.2d 30, 41 (Tex. App.–Austin 1998, pet. denied); Glass v. Petro-Tex Chem.\n\nCorp., 757 F.2d 1554, 1560-61 (5th Cir. 1985)). However, the crux of this issue is the\n\nimpact of appellants’ December 12, 2003 original petition, which was filed more than a\n\nmonth before appellants filed their administrative complaints.\n\n        Because the supreme court has held that a complainant under the TCHRA may not\n\nfile suit until they have exhausted their administrative remedies or, in other words, satisfied\n\nthe mandatory and jurisdictional statutory prerequisites, we conclude that appellants’ action\n\nof filing their lawsuit before filing their complaints with the appropriate commission deprived\n\nthe trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction over their TCHRA claims.12 See Hoffmann-La\n\nRoche, Inc. v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 446 (Tex. 2004) (“The [T]CHRA further\n\nestablishes a comprehensive administrative review system, under which the exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies is a mandatory prerequisite to filing a civil action alleging\n\nviolations of the [T]CHRA.”) (internal quotations omitted); Schroeder, 813 S.W.2d at 486\n\n(holding that “failing to comply [with the statutory prerequisites of the TCHRA] deprives the\n\ncourt of subject[-]matter jurisdiction”); see also Del Mar College Dist. v. Vela, 218 S.W.3d\n\n856, 860 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 2007, no pet.); Vela, 69 S.W.3d at 700. Further,\n\nbecause the supreme court has held that “[t]he absence of subject-matter jurisdiction may\n\n\n      12\n         Appellants have not cited to, nor are we aware of, authority allowing a com plainant under the\nTCHRA to file their lawsuit before filing their com plaint and exhausting their adm inistrative rem edies.\n                                                   23\n\fbe raised by a plea to the jurisdiction, as well as by other procedural vehicles, such as a\n\nmotion for summary judgment,” see Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 553-\n\n54 (Tex. 2000), we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting appellees’ traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment as to appellants’ TCHRA claims. Accordingly, we overrule\n\nappellants’ second issue.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       In sum, we affirm summary judgment as to appellants’ claims against\n\n“Defendants/Appellees Tone Johnson [Jr.] M.D., P.A.[;] Bay Area Care Center, Inc.[;]\n\nMedifast Weight Reduction Center[;] Corpus Christi Regional Center for Addictions, Inc.[;]\n\nCorpus Christi Bay Management Group, Inc.[;] and Coastal Cities, Inc.” We also affirm\n\nsummary judgment as to appellants’ negligent supervision claims against Complete\n\nMedical Care and appellants’ TCHRA claims. We reverse the trial court’s judgment as to\n\nappellants’ claims for assault against Dr. Johnson and Complete Medical Care and\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Johnson and Complete Medical Care\n\nand remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                                   ROGELIO VALDEZ\n                                                   Chief Justice\n\n\nDelivered and filed the\n25th day of February, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\f",

We affirm, in part, and reverse and\n\nremand, in part.\n\n                                              I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz began working with Dr. Johnson at Complete Medical\n\nCare in August 2003, April 2003, and May 2002, respectively. In complaints filed with the\n\nCorpus Christi Human Relations Commission (“CCHRC”) and the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) in January and February 2004, appellants each alleged\n\nthat they were constructively discharged in October 2003.\n\n        Appellants filed their original petition against appellees on December 12, 2003, and\n\ntheir first amended petition on June 21, 2004. In their first amended petition, appellants\n\nasserted claims against appellees for: (1) wrongful discharge and retaliation under chapter\n\n21 of the labor code, see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . §§ 21.051-.106 (Vernon 2006); (2) hostile\n\nwork environment and sexual harassment,2 see id. § 21.051; (3) intentional infliction of\n\n\n         1\n           E&B Medical Association, P.A. does business as Com plete Medical Care; therefore, we will refer\nto the com bined entity as Com plete Medical Care.\n\n        2\n           Sexual harassm ent is a form of sex discrim ination prohibited by section 21.051 of the labor code.\nSee T EX .

(discussing hostile work environm ent as a form of sexual harassm ent); Ewald v. W ornick\nFam ily Foods Corp., 878 S.W .2d 653, 659 (Tex.

Appellees answered with\n\na general denial and asserted various affirmative defenses, including: (1) an assertion that\n\nseveral defendants were “non-employing” entities and that several entities that were sued\n\nare no longer in existence3; (2) appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies\n\nunder chapter 21 of the labor code, see id. §§ 21.201-.211 (Vernon 2006); and (3)\n\nappellants’ claims are time-barred.\n\n         On May 12, 2006, appellees filed a hybrid motion for summary judgment, advancing\n\nboth traditional and no-evidence grounds. Appellants filed a response to appellees’\n\nsummary judgment motions, supplied the trial court with affidavits and deposition tesitmony\n\nof Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz, and filed a motion for continuance requesting more time\n\nto complete discovery.4 Appellees objected to appellants’ response and moved the trial\n\n\n         3\n         In particular, appellees noted that appellants were not em ployed at any tim e by “Dr. Tone Johnson,\nTone Johnson, M.D.[,] P.A[.], Bay Area Care Center, Inc., Medifast W eight Reduction Center, Corpus Christi\nRegional Center for Addictions, Inc., Corpus Christi Bay Managem ent Group, Inc., and Coastal Cities, Inc.”\nAppellees further noted that Tone Johnson M.D., P.A. is a non-existent entity and Medifast W eight Reduction\nCenter and Corpus Christi Bay M anagem ent are no longer in existence. Moreover, appellants, in their\nappellate brief, adm it that they do not seek review of the sum m ary judgm ent granted in favor of\n“Defendants/Appellees Tone Johnson [Jr.], M.D., P.A.[;] Bay Area Care Center, Inc.[;] Medifast W eight\nReduction Center[;] Corpus C hristi Regional Center for Addictions, Inc.[;] Corpus Christi Bay Managem ent\nGroup, Inc.[;] and Coastal Cities, Inc.” because these entities “were not em ployers of Plaintiffs/Appellants.”\n\n         4\n             Appellees argue on appeal that appellants’ response was untim ely because it was allegedly filed less\nthan seven days before the sum m ary judgm ent hearing and appellants failed to file a m otion for leave. See\nT EX . R. C IV . P. 166a(c) (“Except on leave of court, the adverse party, not later than seven days prior to the day\nof hearing m ay file and serve opposing affidavits or other written response.”). The record reflects that\nappellants filed their response in the trial court on May 31, 2006, yet the certificate of service indicates that\nappellees received notice of the response on May 30, 2006. The trial court’s sum m ary judgm ent order states\nthat: “The Court, after considering Defendants’ Motion and Plaintiffs’ reply thereto, is of the opinion that\nDefendants’ Motion has m erit and should in all things be GRANTED.” (Em phasis added.) Therefore, it is\nclear that the trial court considered appellants’ response, and in doing so, the trial court ostensibly granted\nappellants leave to file their response. See Speck v. First Evangelical Lutheran Church of Houston, 235\nS.W .3d 811, 815 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) (“Sum m ary judgm ent evidence m ay be filed\nlate, but only with leave of court. W here nothing appears in the record to indicate that the trial court granted\nleave to file the sum m ary judgm ent response late, we presum e that the trial court did not consider the\nresponse.”); see also Benchmark Bank v. Crowder, 919 S.W .2d 657, 663 (Tex. 1996); INA of Tex. v. Bryant,\n686 S.W .2d 614, 615 (Tex. 1985).\n                                                         3\n\fcourt to strike appellants’ summary judgment evidence because appellants allegedly failed\n\nto direct the trial court to specific portions of the attached deposition testimony that may\n\nhave created a fact issue and precluded summary judgment.\n\n        On June 5, 2006, the trial court conducted a hearing on appellees’ motions for\n\nsummary judgment and appellants’ motion for continuance. Appellants’ counsel was\n\nunable to personally attend the hearing, so the trial court arranged for him to make\n\narguments telephonically. At that time, appellants re-urged their motion for continuance,\n\nwhich the trial court subsequently denied. After hearing arguments, the trial court took the\n\nmatter under advisement.\n\n        On June 15, 2007, the trial court, after considering appellees’ motions, appellants’\n\nresponse, and evidence submitted by both parties, granted appellees’ motions for\n\nsummary judgment without specifying a rationale and ordered that appellants take\n\nnothing.5 See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947466\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947466/lehmann-v-har-con-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (Tex. 2001) (holding that\n\na summary judgment order is final and appealable if it (1) actually disposes of all claims\n\nand parties, or (2) clearly indicates the trial court’s intent to render a final judgment). This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The standard of review for the grant of a motion for summary judgment is\n\ndetermined by whether the motion was brought on no-evidence or traditional grounds. See\n\n\n        5\n           Specifically, the trial court noted in its order that “the Motion[s] for Sum m ary of Defendants is\nGRANTED . . . Plaintiff’s causes of action against Defendants are hereby DISMISSED, and . . . Plaintiffs take\nnothing from defendants . . . .” Neither party argues that the trial court’s judgm ent is not final; therefore, that\nissue is not before us. See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W .3d 191, 206 (Tex. 2001) (“But if the language\nof the order is clear and unequivocal, it m ust be given effect despite any other indications that one or m ore\nparties did not intend for the judgm ent to be final. An express adjudication of all parties and claim s is not\ninterlocutory m erely because the record does not afford a legal basis for the adjudication. In those\ncircum stances, the order m ust be appealed and reversed.”).\n                                                         4\n\fTEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(c), (i); see also Ortega v.

ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Appellants’ Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claims and Challenges\n       to the Trial Court’s Summary Judgment\n\n       At the outset of our analysis, we note that appellants admit in their appellate brief\n\nthat they “do not seek review of the summary judgment in favor of Defendants/Appellees\n\nTone Johnson, M.D., P.A., Bay Area Care Center, Inc., Medifast Weight Reduction Center,\n\nCorpus Christi Regional Center for Addictions, Inc., Corpus Christi Bay Management\n\nGroup, Inc., and Coastal Cities, Inc.” Therefore, we affirm summary judgment as to those\n\ndefendants.6 See Adams v.

App.–Dallas 1999, no\n\npet.)).\n\n          We further note that neither Dr. Johnson nor Complete Medical Care moved for\n\nsummary judgment as to appellants’ claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nTherefore, without addressing the merits of appellants’ intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claims, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of appellees as to those claims. See Wright v. Sydow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367462/wright-v-sydow/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied) (stating that “[a] trial court can enter a\n\nsummary judgment only against those claims attacked in a motion for summary judgment”)\n\n(citing McConnell v.

Appellants’ Claims Against Dr. Johnson\n\n          By their first issue, appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Dr. Johnson because their summary judgment evidence, including\n\naffidavits and deposition testimony attached to their response, raised a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact, thereby precluding summary judgment. Specifically, appellants argue that\n\nthe attached affidavits and deposition testimony raised a material fact issue as to their\n\nclaims of assault against Dr. Johnson.7 Appellees counter that appellants’ summary\n\njudgment evidence is insufficient to raise a material fact issue because appellants failed\n\nto specifically designate and reference portions of their deposition testimony they relied\n\nupon in their response to appellees’ summary judgment motions. Appellees also argue\n\n          7\n            Except for their assault and intentional infliction of em otional distress claim s, appellants concede\nall of their rem aining claim s against Dr. Johnson.\n                                                        8\n\fthat appellants’ summary judgment evidence failed to establish that Dr. Johnson “made\n\nphysical contact with the Plaintiffs’ person” or, in other words, assaulted appellants.\n\n       1.     Applicable Law\n\n       “To establish a prima facie claim for civil assault, the plaintiff must establish the\n\nsame elements required for criminal assault.” Johnson v.

Civ. App.–Corpus Christi 1980, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).            Section\n\n22.01(a)(2)-(3) of the penal code provides that a person commits an assault if he\n\nintentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another when the person knows or\n\nshould reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative\n\nor intentionally or knowingly threatens another with imminent bodily injury. TEX . PENAL\n\nCODE ANN . § 22.01(a)(2)-(3) (Vernon Supp. 2009); see Johnson, 178 S.W.3d at 240.\n\n       2.     Discussion\n\n       In the present case, appellees moved for a no-evidence summary judgment on\n\nappellants’ assault claims as to Dr. Johnson; therefore, appellants had the burden to\n\nprovide competent summary judgment evidence raising a material fact issue. See TEX . R.\n\nCIV . P. 166a(i); see also Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. A review of the summary judgment\n\nevidence in the record reveals that Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz each offered deposition\n\ntestimony that Dr. Johnson made offensive contact with them. Gallegos testified that Dr.\n\nJohnson: (1) tried to grab her on numerous occasions; (2) tried to kiss her and stick his\n\ntongue in her ear; (3) grabbed her in the breast area; (4) repeatedly forced her to lean\n\nagainst him; (5) hugged her waist; and (6) played with her hair, all while expressing that he\n\nwanted to have sex with her. Ramon stated that Dr. Johnson attempted to grab her every\n\n\n                                             9\n\ftime she walked by him, which occurred many times a day, and made numerous obscene\n\ngestures to her with his mouth. Salaiz testified that Dr. Johnson: (1) put his arm around\n\nher while he was opening the door to a patient’s room; (2) pushed her against the wall and\n\nasked, “What do you think I’m going to do to you . . . .”; and (3) grabbed her hand and\n\nmoved his finger in a circular motion, which she interpreted to mean that he wanted to have\n\nsex with her. Gallegos, Ramon, and Salaiz each noted that the contact or attempted\n\ncontact made by Dr. Johnson was offensive and unwanted. Viewing this evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-movant, we cannot say that Dr. Johnson was entitled to a\n\nno-evidence summary judgment.\n\n        However, in the trial court and on appeal, appellees argued that appellants’\n\nsummary judgment evidence was insufficient because appellants failed to direct the trial\n\ncourt to portions of their summary judgment evidence that demonstrated that Dr. Johnson\n\nassaulted appellants.

The Rogers court stated that appellant’s summary judgment\n\nmotion “does no more than refer to whatever may have been ‘on file.’ Such a general\n\nreference to a voluminous record which does not direct the trial court and parties to the\n\nevidence on which the movant relies is insufficient.” Id. As a result, the Rogers court\n\nconcluded that appellant’s summary judgment motion could not be sustained on the basis\n\nof the referenced deposition. Id. Here, appellants are not asserting entitlement to\n\nsummary judgment; instead, appellants had a summary judgment rendered against them.\n\nTexas courts have held for nearly fifty years that the purpose of summary judgment is to\n\neliminate “patently unmeritorious claims or untenable defenses,” not to “deprive litigants\n\nof their rights to a full hearing on the merits of any real issue of fact.” Gulbenkian v.

(op.\n\non reh’g). Therefore, it makes sense that the supreme court would hold that a summary\n\njudgment movant’s failure to specifically reference portions of their summary judgment\n\nevidence precludes summary judgment, because in holding otherwise, the non-movant\n\nwould not have received adequate notice of the movant’s reliance on the deposition not\n\ncontained in the record, and thus, the non-movant would be deprived of their right to a full\n\nhearing on the merits.\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       In Guthrie, the Houston First Court of Appeals considered a situation where the\n\nproponent of the evidence attached a 500-page deposition to his response to a motion for\n\nsummary judgment. See Guthrie, 934 S.W.2d at 825. In his response, the proponent\n\nfailed to make any reference to the deposition, and the trial court refused to consider the\n\ndeposition as summary judgment evidence. See id. at 826. The court of appeals affirmed\n\nthe trial court’s decision, reasoning that “the trial court should not be compelled to sift\n\nthrough a 500-page deposition to search for evidence supporting the contestants’\n\ncontentions.” Id. In arriving at its holding, the court of appeals relied on the Texas\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in Rogers that general references to a voluminous record do not\n\ndirect trial courts and parties to evidence on which the movant relies. See 772 S.W.2d at\n\n81.\n\n       In the case at bar, appellants did not attach a “voluminous” record to their response\n\nto appellees’ summary judgment motions. Appellants’ summary judgment evidence was\n\ncomprised of approximately 185 pages of deposition testimony, which was condensed to\n\nthirty-three pages (double-sided) of actual testimony. The testimony itself was rife with\n\naccusations of sexual misconduct, harassment, and other indiscretions allegedly\n\ncommitted by Dr. Johnson. A mere cursory review of the deposition testimony would have\n\ninformed the trial court and appellees of the various allegations of misconduct involving Dr.\n\nJohnson; thus, the relevance of the depositions was readily ascertainable. Moreover,\n\nappellants’ response clearly referenced the deposition testimony, noted that the testimony\n\nestablished questions of fact as to appellants’ underlying assault and intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress claims against all defendants, and included affidavits from appellants\n\nclearly stating Dr. Johnson’s alleged transgressions and how those transgressions caused\n\n\n                                             12\n\fappellants’ injuries. Therefore, because the record was not voluminous in this case, and\n\nbecause appellants clearly referenced their summary judgment evidence and noted that\n\nthe summary judgment evidence raised issues of material fact regarding the underlying\n\nassault and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, we do not believe this\n\nsituation to be akin to the situations in Rogers and Guthrie.\n\n       Appellants cite to the El Paso Court of Appeals’ holding in Barraza v. Eureka\n\nCompany and the Austin Court of Appeals’ holding in Hinojosa v.

We do not\n       believe this is the meaning of the rule.\n\n              Rule 166a(d) provides three methods to present unfiled discovery\n       before the trial court. First, a party may file the discovery with the trial court.\n       Second, a party may file an appendix containing the evidence. Finally, a\n       party may simply file a notice with specific references to the unfiled\n       discovery. Nowhere does the rule require that the proponent of the evidence\n       provide specific references to the discovery, if the actual documents are\n       before the trial court, in order for the trial court to consider it. The Texas\n       Supreme Court has held that the “notice of intent” requirement is fulfilled\n       when the proponent attaches copies of the discovery to its motion and the\n                                               13\n\f       motion clearly relies on the attached discovery as support. . . .\n\n25 S.W.3d at 228-29 (emphasis added).\n\n       In Hinojosa, the court of appeals addressed a traditional motion for partial summary\n\njudgment granted in favor of a hospital, physician, and the physician’s practice group in a\n\nsituation involving the death of a baby during the labor and delivery process. 106 S.W.3d\n\nat 382. Appellants claimed that a material fact issue existed as to their underlying wrongful\n\ndeath and survival statute claims because, among the evidence produced at the summary\n\njudgment proceedings, was a death certificate that demonstrated that the baby was born\n\nalive and survived for twenty minutes. Id. at 384, 386-87. Appellees argued that the death\n\ncertificate, though attached to appellants’ response to appellees’ summary judgment\n\nmotion, was insufficient to raise a fact issue because the response did “not specifically rely\n\non the death certificate’s statutory significance.” Id. at 387. In sustaining appellants’ issue\n\nand reversing the trial court’s summary judgment, the court of appeals noted the following:\n\n       Appellees’ position confuses the requirement that all issues be raised in a\n       motion before the trial court with an assessment of all the evidence produced\n       in the summary-judgment proceedings. An issue is a proposition specifically\n       addressed to the cause of action or claim that, if found to be true, directly\n       requires that summary judgment be either granted or denied. Issues must\n       be set out specifically in a motion, answer, or other response. Evidence, on\n       the other hand, comprises the documents and other materials included in the\n       record that tend to make the proposition at issue more or less probable. A\n       non-movant need not set out the exact evidence on which it relies or explain\n       with specificity how this evidence supports the issues it raises; summary\n       judgment is not a trial by affidavit or deposition. Evidence need only be\n       referenced or attached in order for a court to consider it.\n\nId. at 387-88 (emphasis added and citations omitted).\n\n       In this case, we agree with the proposition that rule 166a(d) only required appellants\n\nto reference evidence attached to their response to the summary judgment, especially\n\nconsidering appellants’ summary judgment evidence is not voluminous. See Barraza, 25\n                                        14\n\fS.W.3d at 228-29; see also Hinojosa, 106 S.W.3d at 387-88. As previously noted,\n\nappellants’ response clearly referenced the deposition testimony of Gallegos, Ramon, and\n\nSalaiz as evidence raising a fact issue and precluding summary judgment as to whether\n\nDr. Johnson assaulted appellants, and the trial court indicated in its summary judgment\n\norder that it considered appellants’ response. Furthermore, in reviewing appellants’\n\ndeposition testimony, we find numerous factual allegations of assault against Dr. Johnson\n\nthat would defeat appellees’ summary judgment motion; it is clear to us that the trial court\n\ngranted appellees’ summary judgment motion as to appellants’ assault claims merely\n\nbecause appellants did not include specific references to the summary judgment evidence\n\nthat were to the trial court’s liking. We do not believe that appellants should be deprived\n\nof their right to a full hearing on the merits of their case based on a technicality given that\n\nthe underlying summary judgment record is not voluminous. We conclude that appellants’\n\ndeposition testimony was properly before the trial court and effectively raised a material\n\nfact issue precluding summary judgment as to appellants’ assault claims against Dr.\n\nJohnson. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see also Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. Therefore, we\n\nfurther conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nappellees as to appellants’ assault claims against Dr. Johnson. See TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(i);\n\nsee also Ortega, 97 S.W.3d at 772. Accordingly, we sustain appellants’ first issue as it\n\npertains to appellants’ claims of assault against Dr. Johnson.\n\nC.     Appellants’ Claims against Complete Medical Care\n\n       Also in their first issue, appellants argue that the deposition testimony of Gallegos,\n\nRamon, and Salaiz raise a fact issue as to their claims against Complete Medical Care for\n\nretaliation, aiding or abetting discrimination, sex discrimination, assault under the doctrine\n\n\n                                              15\n\fof respondeat superior, and negligent supervision.9 Appellees assert that appellants’\n\nsummary judgment evidence did not raise a material fact issue precluding summary\n\njudgment.\n\n        1.       Complete Medical Care’s Liability for Assault\n\n        In their first amended petition, appellants asserted an assault claim against\n\nComplete Medical Care under an agency theory. Appellees, in their no-evidence summary\n\njudgment motion, argued that the record contains “no evidence that any of the Defendants\n\nmade physical contact with the Plaintiffs’ person.” The supreme court has noted the\n\nfollowing regarding an employer’s liability for assaults committed by its employees:\n\n        Generally, a master is vicariously liable for the torts of its servants committed\n        in the course and scope of their employment.

See T EX . L ABO R C OD E A N N . §§ 21.051, 21.055 (Vernon\n2006). W ith respect to the purported “aiding and abetting discrim ination” claim , we note that Texas courts\nhave held that the purpose of pleadings is to give an adversary notice of claim s and defenses, as well as\nnotice of the relief sought.

The record before us indicates that the “aiding and\nabetting discrim ination” issue was first raised in appellees’ m otions for sum m ary judgm ent. Appellants did\nnot even address this claim in their response. Therefore, we cannot say that the record reflects that the\nparties tried the unpleaded “aiding and abetting discrim ination” issue by consent. As such, we need not\naddress this claim .

At the very least, appellants’ summary judgment evidence raises a\n\nmaterial fact issue as to whether: (1) Dr. Johnson’s alleged conduct was committed in the\n\naccomplishment of a duty entrusted to him or because of personal animosity; or (2) Dr.\n\nJohnson, as co-owner of Complete Medical Care, was a vice-principal and, therefore,\n\nliability for his actions was imputed to the business. We therefore conclude that the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment as to appellants’ claims against Complete\n\nMedical Care for assault under agency theory.\n\n      2.     Negligent Supervision\n\n\n                                            18\n\f       In their first amended petition, appellants also raised a claim for negligent\n\nsupervision against Complete Medical Care. In their no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment, appellees alleged that the record contains no evidence that Complete Medical\n\nCare failed to supervise its employees. However, appellants did not even reference their\n\nnegligent supervision claim in their response to appellees’ no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment, much less assert that their summary judgment evidence raised a\n\nmaterial fact issue as to their negligent supervision claim. As noted earlier, appellants\n\nwere required to specifically set out their issues in their response. See Hinojosa, 106\n\nS.W.3d at 387 (stating that an issue “is a proposition specifically addressed to a cause of\n\naction or claim that, if found to be true, directly required that summary judgment be either\n\ngranted or denied” and that “[i]ssues must be set out specifically in a motion, answer, or\n\nother response”). By their failing to do so, we cannot say that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment as to appellants’ negligent supervision claim.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we sustain appellants’ first issue as it pertains to their\n\nassault claim against Complete Medical Care; we overrule appellants’ first issue as it\n\nrelates to appellants’ negligent supervision claim against Complete Medical Care.\n\nD.     Appellants’ Claims Brought Under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\n       Act (“TCHRA”)\n\n       By their second issue, appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to their retaliation and sex discrimination claims that were brought\n\nunder the TCHRA. In particular, appellants argue that the trial court erred in concluding\n\nthat they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to these claims. Appellees\n\nassert that appellants did not properly exhaust their administrative remedies before filing\n\nsuit on their TCHRA claims; therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary\n                                            19\n\fjudgment.\n\n       1.     The TCHRA\n\n       The TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051. Specifically, section\n\n21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n       discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\n       compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n              (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n       employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\n       of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\n       status of an employee.\n\nId. The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who: “(1) opposes discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files\n\na complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation,\n\nproceeding, or hearing.” Id. § 21.055. Because one of the purposes of the TCHRA is to\n\ncorrelate state law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination, we may look\n\nto federal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA.

Discussion\n\n       Appellees contended in their traditional motion for summary judgment that\n\nappellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to their TCHRA\n                                             20\n\fclaims. Specifically, appellees argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nbecause appellants filed suit before filing a complaint or charge of discrimination with the\n\nproper commission. See TEX . LABOR CODE ANN . § 21.201. In support of their motion,\n\nappellees attached: (1) appellants’ first amended petition, which was filed on June 21,\n\n2004; (2) Gallegos’s charge of discrimination filed with the CCHRC and the EEOC on\n\nJanuary 24, 2004; (3) Ramon’s charge of discrimination filed with the CCHRC and the\n\nEEOC on January 24, 2004; and (4) Salaiz’s charge of discrimination filed with the CCHRC\n\nand the EEOC on February 11, 2004. On appeal, appellees direct us to appellants’ original\n\npetition filed on December 12, 2003, to support their contention that appellants improperly\n\nfiled suit before filing their administrative complaint or exhausting their administrative\n\nremedies. Moreover, appellees argued in their summary judgment motion and on appeal\n\nthat appellants’ failure to obtain a right-to-sue letter from the CCHRC and the EEOC\n\nconstitutes a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.\n\n        Before filing suit against an employer in state court, an employee must exhaust his\n\nor her administrative remedies by first filing a complaint with the Texas Commission on\n\nHuman Rights (the “Commission”) within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act.

See TEX . LABOR CODE ANN . §§ 21.201-.202, 21.208, 21.256 (Vernon\n\n2006).\n\n         The exhaustion requirement is satisfied when appellant is entitled to receive a right-\n\nto-sue letter.

LABOR CODE ANN . § 21.208).\n\n         In the present case, appellants noted in their administrative complaints that they\n\ntook issue with the facts surrounding their constructive discharge occurring on or about\n\nOctober 17, 2003. Thus, appellants timely filed their complaints within 180 days of the\n\nalleged discriminatory act. See id. § 21.202(a); Rice, 131 S.W.3d at 513; Schroeder, 813\n\n\n                                               22\n\fS.W.2d at 485-86; see also Donna Indep. Sch. Dist. v.

(“When a charge is timely filed as to one act of discrimination, the ‘continuing\n\nviolation’ doctrine expands the scope of those discriminatory events that are actionable,\n\nas long as one of the events occurs within the 180-day period.”) (citing Wal-Mart Stores v.\n\nDavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416595\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416595/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (Tex.

However, the crux of this issue is the\n\nimpact of appellants’ December 12, 2003 original petition, which was filed more than a\n\nmonth before appellants filed their administrative complaints.\n\n        Because the supreme court has held that a complainant under the TCHRA may not\n\nfile suit until they have exhausted their administrative remedies or, in other words, satisfied\n\nthe mandatory and jurisdictional statutory prerequisites, we conclude that appellants’ action\n\nof filing their lawsuit before filing their complaints with the appropriate commission deprived\n\nthe trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction over their TCHRA claims.12 See Hoffmann-La\n\nRoche, Inc. v.

Further,\n\nbecause the supreme court has held that “[t]he absence of subject-matter jurisdiction may\n\n\n      12\n         Appellants have not cited to, nor are we aware of, authority allowing a com plainant under the\nTCHRA to file their lawsuit before filing their com plaint and exhausting their adm inistrative rem edies.\n                                                   23\n\fbe raised by a plea to the jurisdiction, as well as by other procedural vehicles, such as a\n\nmotion for summary judgment,” see Bland Indep.

We reverse the trial court’s judgment as to\n\nappellants’ claims for assault against Dr. Johnson and Complete Medical Care and\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Johnson and Complete Medical Care\n\nand remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                                   ROGELIO VALDEZ\n                                                   Chief Justice\n\n\nDelivered and filed the\n25th day of February, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\f</pre>",
