R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. We will\n\naffirm.\n\n                                               I.\n\n          Joseph Aruanno is a twice-convicted sex offender. In 1994, while in Florida, he\n\nexposed himself to two adolescent girls as they were walking home from school and\n\nengaged in lewd conduct in their presence. As a result of this incident, Aruanno pled\n\nguilty to second-degree lewd conduct, and was sentenced to ten years’ probation. J.A. 46.\n\nJust two years later, in 1996, Aruanno sexually molested an eight-year-old girl who had\n\nbeen playing on the front steps of her house in Wildwood, New Jersey. A jury convicted\n\nAruanno of second-degree sexual assault, and he was sentenced to ten years in prison, and\n\ndisqualification from parole for five years. J.A. 47. The Appellate Division of the New\n\nJersey Superior Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The New Jersey Supreme\n\nCourt denied certification. State v. Aruanno, 793 A.2d 716 (N.J. 2002) (table op.).\n\n          In April 2004, while Aruanno was still serving his prison sentence, the State of\n\nNew Jersey (hereinfter “the State”) filed a petition to involuntarily commit Aruanno\n\npursuant to the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predator Act (“SVPA”), N.J.S.A. § 30:4-\n\n27.24 et seq. Partially due to Aruanno’s repeated insistence that he be appointed new\n\ncounsel, a hearing on the petition was not held until May 9, 2005, and Aruanno was\n\ndetained until that time pursuant to a temporary commitment order. J.A. 49-50.\n\n          At the commitment hearing, the State presented the testimony of Dr. Vivian\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fShnaidman, a psychologist. Dr. Shnaidman testified that Aruanno was a chronic paranoid\n\nschizophrenic, but her diagnosis explicitly ruled out diagnoses of exhibitionism and\n\npedophilia. J.A. 54. Nevertheless, Dr. Shnaidman opined that Aruanno’s schizophrenia,\n\nwhen combined with his previous violent conduct, created a “very high” risk of future\n\nviolence. J.A. 55. In particular, because Aruanno refused to take psychotropic\n\nmedication to treat his schizophrenia, he would continue to suffer from psychotic\n\ndelusions which would render sex offender treatment useless. According to Dr.\n\nShnaidman, Aruanno would have serious difficulty controlling his sexually predatory\n\nbehavior without undergoing treatment for his schizophrenia. J.A. 55-56.\n\n       Aruanno testified on his own behalf at the hearing. He denied committing either\n\nthe Florida or the New Jersey offense, and testified that he believed the State had filed the\n\ncommitment petition in retribution for his decision to go to trial for the New Jersey\n\noffense, rather than accepting a deal to plead guilty. J.A. 51. Aruanno was also given the\n\nopportunity to present the testimony of his own psychologist, but after meeting with\n\nAruanno, the psychologist reported that he was “unable to render an opinion to a\n\nreasonable degree of medical certainty.” J.A. 54.\n\n       The state court found that Aruanno suffered from a mental abnormality which\n\ncreated “substantial, significant, severe difficulty controlling his sexually violent\n\nbehavior,” and granted the State’s petition for involuntary commitment. J.A. 58.\n\nAruanno appealed the order, and the Appellate Division affirmed. In re Civil\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fCommitment of J.A., 2007 WL 609284 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2007).\n\n       On January 20, 2006, Aruanno filed a pro se complaint and accompanying motion\n\nto proceed in forma pauperis in the United States District Court for the District of New\n\nJersey.1 J.A. 18-21. Construed liberally,2 the complaint asserted that Aruanno’s due\n\nprocess rights were violated by the procedure used by the State to commit him. After\n\nscreening the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2), the District Court granted\n\nAruanno in forma pauperis status but dismissed the complaint as frivolous. The District\n\nCourt reasoned that the sole remedy available to Aruanno was a writ of habeas corpus,\n\nand that the claim asserted in his complaint would necessarily imply the invalidity of his\n\nconfinement, in violation of Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994). J.A. 28-30.\n\n       Aruanno appealed, and we vacated the dismissal and remanded for further\n\nproceedings. Aruanno v. New Jersey, 215 Fed. App’x 157 (3d Cir. 2007) (“Aruanno I”).\n\nCiting Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74 (2005), we noted that judgment in Aruanno’s\n\nfavor would not necessarily result in his release; rather, success on his due process claims\n\nwould entitle Aruanno only to a new civil commitment hearing. Aruanno I, 215 Fed.\n\nApp’x at 158.\n\n       In April 2007, the State filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R.\n\n\n\n       1\n         The complaint was apparently filed while his appeal from the state court’s order\nof civil commitment was still pending.\n       2\n      “Where the plaintiff is a pro se litigant, the court has an obligation to construe the\ncomplaint liberally.” Giles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318, 322 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n                                             4\n\fCiv. P. 12(b)(6), arguing that Aruanno’s due process rights were not violated by the\n\nhearing which resulted in his commitment. On July 29, 2008, the District Court entered\n\nan order dismissing Aruanno’s complaint without prejudice, holding that 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983 did not provide a cause of action against the State, and that the State was entitled to\n\nimmunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n       Aruanno then moved for leave to file an amended complaint, which was granted in\n\nJanuary 2009. The amended complaint named as defendants the Commissioner of the\n\nNew Jersey Department of Corrections, George Hayman, the Commissioner of the New\n\nJersey Department of Human Services, Jennifer Velez, and the Attorney General of the\n\nState of New Jersey, Anne Milgram, all in their official capacities.\n\n       On April 9, 2009, the State filed another Rule 12(b)(6) motion. In an order and\n\nletter opinion, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss Aruanno’s amended\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.3 J.A. 3-10. Aruanno timely appealed the\n\ndismissal.4\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Aruanno raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether the District Court failed to\n\n\n       3\n        The State contends that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the amended\ncomplaint because it “related back” to the original complaint. We reject this argument.\nSee Bowers v. NCAA, 346 F.3d 402, 418 (3d Cir. 2003) and Callahan v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 207 F.3d 668, 670 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651,\n664-70 (1974)). Nor is Aruanno’s §1983 claim, which relates back to the date of his\noriginal pleading, time-barred. See Hodge v. U.S., 554 F.3d 372, 377 (3d Cir. 2009).\n       4\n           We have jurisdiction over Aruanno’s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                              5\n\ffollow the law of the case; (2) whether the District Court improperly relied upon the\n\ndecisions of New Jersey state courts; and (3) whether the procedure used to commit\n\nAruanno under the SVPA violated Aruanno’s constitutional right to due process.\n\n                                    A. Law of the Case\n\n       Aruanno argues that in granting the New Jersey officials’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion,\n\nthe District Court failed to comply with the law of the case.5 “The law of the case\n\ndoctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue\n\nto govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.” Feesers, Inc. v.\n\nMichael Foods, Inc., 591 F.3d 191, 207 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Arizona v. California,\n\n460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983)) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Aruanno\n\npoints to our February 2007 decision, Aruanno I, in which we reversed the District\n\nCourt’s dismissal of Aruanno’s complaint, as necessarily implying the invalidity of his\n\nconfinement.\n\n       However, contrary to Aruanno’s assertion, Aruanno I did not hold that Aruanno\n\nhad in fact pled legally viable claims. Rather, it noted that Aruanno’s claims, if\n\nsuccessful, would entitle him to a new civil commitment hearing, but not necessarily to\n\nrelease. Id. at 158. In other words, Aruanno I did not decide the issues which were sent\n\nback to the District Court on remand, and which are now pending before us on appeal.\n\n\n\n       5\n        We exercise plenary review over the question of whether the District Court\nproperly interpreted the law of the case. Cooper Distrib. Co. v. Amana Refrigeration,\nInc., 180 F.3d 542, 546 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n                                             6\n\fThe “law of the case” doctrine is therefore inapposite.\n\n                            B. Improper Reliance on State Law\n\n       Aruanno contends that the District Court relied so heavily upon decisions issued by\n\nNew Jersey’s state courts that it effectively abdicated its responsibility as the “primary\n\nand final arbiter of federal rights.” 6 Kovats v. Rutgers, 749 F.2d 1041, 1046 n.5 (3d Cir.\n\n1984). Aruanno is incorrect. The District Court made appropriate references to state-\n\ncourt decisions in order to explain the judicial interpretation and application of the statute\n\nwhose constitutionality the Court was evaluating—the SVPA. Moreover, the District\n\nCourt was entitled to look to state-court decisions, even on federal constitutional issues,\n\nand rely on them for their persuasive value. See Charles W. v. Maul, 214 F.3d 350, 357\n\n(2d Cir. 2000) (“State court decisions . . . are relevant and often persuasive.”).\n\n                 C. Constitutionality of the SVPA Commitment Procedure\n\n       Aruanno argues that since the procedure used by the State to civilly commit him\n\npursuant to the SVPA violated his constitutional right to due process, the District Court\n\nerred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).7\n\n\n       6\n        The question of whether the District Court improperly relied upon the decisions of\nNew Jersey courts is a matter of law over which we exercise plenary review. See United\nStates v. Stinson, 592 F.3d 460, 462 n.1 (3d Cir. 2010).\n       7\n       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s decision to dismiss\nAruanno’s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), Capogrosso v. Supreme Court of New Jersey,\n588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2009), accepting as true the facts as pled in the complaint, and\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in Aruanno’s favor. Odd v. Malone, 538 F.3d 202, 205\n\n                                              7\n\f        According to Aruanno, the process afforded to him under the SVPA was\n\nconstitutionally deficient in four respects: (1) the State was permitted to obtain an ex\n\nparte temporary order of detention against Aruanno without appointing counsel to advise\n\nhim and without holding a hearing at which Aruanno could contest the detention; (2) the\n\nState was permitted to use information elicited from Aruanno to support its case for\n\nAruanno’s commitment, even though Aruanno had not been warned or given an\n\nopportunity to consult with or be represented by counsel; (3) the State was only required\n\nto satisfy a “clear and convincing” standard of evidence in order to obtain Aruanno’s\n\ncommitment, rather than the more demanding “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard; and\n\n(4) the State was permitted to civilly commit Aruanno without the protections afforded by\n\na jury trial.\n\n        The validity of Aruanno’s constitutional claims turns on whether the SVPA’s\n\ncommitment hearing process is truly civil and regulatory in nature, or whether it is\n\nactually a criminal proceeding masquerading as civil commitment. We conclude that the\n\nstate action prescribed by the SVPA is genuinely civil in nature, Aruanno’s claims\n\nregarding the act’s constitutionality are unavailing, and the District Court did not err in\n\ndismissing them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).8\n\n\n(3d Cir. 2008).\n\n\n        8\n        In fact, the SVPA is a civil, not criminal, statute. The SVPA allows a court to\nauthorize temporary commitment based on an ex parte submission made by the Attorney\nGeneral, N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.28(g), but requires that any person so committed be afforded\n\n                                              8\n\f                               1. SVPA: Civil or Criminal?\n\n       In determining whether the SVPA should be properly categorized civil or criminal\n\nin nature, we are guided by the Supreme Court’s analysis in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521\n\nU.S. 346 (1997). In Hendricks, the Supreme Court considered various constitutional\n\nchallenges to a statute enacted by the State of Kansas which provided for the involuntary\n\nconfinement of persons classified as “sexually violent predators.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 59-\n\n29a01 et seq. (2009).9\n\n       The Hendricks Court began its analysis of the Kansas statute at issue (hereinafter\n\n\n\na hearing within twenty days of the commitment order. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.29(a). The\nmaximum length of commitment that may result before a hearing and the participation of\nthe offender/defendant is therefore twenty days.\n\n       Moreover, in the case of an inmate scheduled for release, like Aruanno, the\ntemporary commitment is accomplished by the submission of two statements prepared by\nmedical professionals, one of whom must be a psychiatrist, certifying that he is a sexually\nviolent predator in need of involuntary commitment. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.28(c).\n\n       Indeed, In re Commitment of M.M., 894 A.2d 1158 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.\n2006), cited by the dissent, is largely inapposite and in any event acknowledges that the\ntwenty-day statutory period is constitutionally reasonable. Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480\n(1980), is not apposite either. Vitek merely held that a prisoner is entitled to due process\nprotections before being transferred to a psychiatric facility.\n\n      As noted in text, we have followed Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997),\nholding that the Kansas SVPA does not violate constitutional guarantees of due process,\nand we have therefore concluded that the New Jersey SVPA is similarly constitutional.\n       9\n        The Hendricks analysis is of particular significance to the instant case, since New\nJersey’s SVPA “is virtually identical to the language of the Kansas SVPA challenged in\nHendricks . . . .” In re Commitment of W.Z., 801 A.2d 205, 211 (N.J. 2002); compare\nN.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.24 et seq. with Kan. Stat. Ann. § 59-29a01 et seq.\n\n                                              9\n\f“K-SVPA”) with an examination of “whether the legislature meant the statute to establish\n\n‘civil’ proceedings.” 521 U.S. at 361. The Court observed the K-SVPA’s placement in\n\nthe Kansas probate code rather than the criminal code, and the Kansas legislature’s own\n\nreference to the legislation as creating a “civil commitment procedure.” Id. The Court\n\nsuggested that the statute served neither of the two primary objectives of criminal\n\npunishment – not retribution because the statute did not “affix culpability for prior\n\ncriminal conduct” or require a finding of scienter – and not deterrence because by\n\ndefinition, committees suffered from “mental abnormality” which prevented them from\n\ncontrolling their behavior. Id. at 362.\n\n       Next, the Court rejected Hendricks’ contentions that the potentially indefinite\n\nlength of his commitment and the presence of certain procedural protections more\n\ntypically found in criminal statutes rendered the proceedings essentially criminal. Id. at\n\n363-65. Finally, the Court was unpersuaded by Hendricks’ argument that the statute’s\n\nfailure to provide treatment for committed offenders revealed its criminal character.\n\n       The Court concluded:\n\n              Where the State has disavowed any punitive intent; limited confinement to a\n              small segment of particularly dangerous individuals; provided strict\n              procedural safeguards; directed that confined persons be segregated from\n              the general prison population and afforded the same status as others who\n              have been civilly committed; recommended treatment if such is possible;\n              and permitted immediate release upon a showing that the individual is no\n              longer dangerous or mentally impaired, we cannot say that it acted with\n              punitive intent. We therefore hold that the Act does not establish criminal\n              proceedings and that involuntary confinement under the Act is not punitive.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fId. at 368-69.\n\n       Like the K-SVPA, the SVPA is not part of New Jersey’s criminal code,10 and the\n\nlanguage of the statute describes its procedure as a civil commitment process which\n\nrecognizes “the need for commitment of those sexually violent predators who pose a\n\ndanger to others should they be returned to society.” N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.25(c). Although\n\nthis label is not entirely dispositive, it places the burden on Aruanno to provide “the\n\nclearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to\n\nnegate the State’s intention to deem it civil.” Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 361 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1980)) (alterations and internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       Aruanno cannot meet this burden. Although facilities housing committed sex\n\noffenders are managed by the Department of Corrections, the SVPA requires that\n\noffenders subject to civil commitment be housed separately from offenders under the\n\ngeneral supervision of the Department of Corrections. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.34(a). The\n\nSVPA also requires that the Department of Human Services provide treatment that is\n\n“appropriately tailored to address the specific needs of sexually violent predators.”\n\nN.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.34(b).\n\n       Finally, like the K-SVPA, the SVPA provides for reevaluation of involuntarily\n\ncommitted persons every year. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.35. Committees may also be\n\n\n\n       10\n            Title 30 of the New Jersey Statutes is captioned “Institutions and Agencies.”\n\n                                               11\n\fauthorized by members of the treatment staff to file a petition for discharge from\n\ninvoluntary commitment. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.36.\n\n       Under the framework established in Hendricks, we hold that the New Jersey SVPA\n\nserves an essentially regulatory civil function. Having thus established the proper context\n\nin which to evaluate the constitutionality of the SVPA, we now proceed to analyze the\n\nmerits of Aruanno’s four challenges to its procedures.\n\n                         2. Ex Parte Temporary Detention Order\n\n       Aruanno argues that his rights were violated when the court entered a temporary\n\ndetention order pending his final commitment hearing without first appointing counsel for\n\nAruanno, and without holding a hearing in which Aruanno might challenge the temporary\n\ndetention.\n\n       The SVPA provides that the subject of a temporary commitment order is entitled to\n\na hearing within twenty days of entry of the order, and that the person subject to\n\ncommitment must be represented by counsel at that hearing. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.29; see\n\nGreenfield v. New Jersey Dept. of Corrections, 888 A.2d 507, 510 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\n\nDiv. 2006). Aruanno does not cite any authority for the proposition that he is entitled to\n\nan earlier hearing, notice of the temporary commitment order, or to counsel before the 20-\n\nday preliminary hearing. As the New Jersey Superior Court has reasoned: “The twenty-\n\nday period for pre-hearing detention is deemed constitutionally reasonable because of the\n\nurgency at its inception and in order to permit time for preparations essential to a fair and\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fmeaningful hearing. Those essential preparations include testing and observation\n\nadequate to permit a diagnosis, notice to the patient, assignment of counsel, opportunity\n\nto prepare the case and court scheduling.” In re Commitment of M.M., 894 A.2d 1158,\n\n1167 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2006) (internal citation omitted).\n\n       Furthermore, we have previously noted the Supreme Court’s implicit rejection of a\n\nconstitutional challenge to a statute which permitted emergency confinement for fifteen\n\ndays without prior notice or a hearing. See Reese v. Nelson, 598 F.2d 822, 826-27 (3d\n\nCir. 1979) (citing Briggs v. Arafeh, 411 U.S. 911 (1973)). Accordingly, this claim fails.\n\n                       3. Use of Information Elicited from Aruanno\n\n       Aruanno complains that his constitutional rights were violated when the State used\n\ninformation elicited from him to support its case for Aruanno’s commitment, even though\n\nAruanno had not been warned that the information could be used against him at the\n\ncommitment hearing, and he had not been given an opportunity to consult with or be\n\nrepresented by counsel before the information was elicited. Though Aruanno’s brief does\n\nnot expressly reference the Fifth Amendment, the substance of his argument indicates that\n\nhe believes the SVPA violates his constitutional right against self-incrimination, and we\n\nwill analyze his claim on that basis.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause, by its own terms, applies only\n\nto criminal cases. See U.S. Const. amdt. V. In Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364 (1986), the\n\nSupreme Court considered the very issue Aruanno raises here: whether the right against\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fself-incrimination applies to civil commitment proceedings. The Court held that the right\n\nagainst self-incrimination only applies to protect individuals subject to commitment\n\nproceedings labeled as “civil” by a state if “the statutory scheme is so punitive either in\n\npurpose or effect as to negate the State’s intention that the proceeding be civil . . . .” Id.\n\nat 369 (quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 249 (1980)) (alterations omitted).\n\nAccordingly, this claim fails.\n\n                        4. “Clear and Convincing” Standard of Proof\n\n       Aruanno argues that the SVPA is constitutionally flawed because it permits the\n\nState to involuntarily commit sex offenders upon a showing of clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the offender is a “sexually violent predator.” N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.32.\n\nAccording to Aruanno, the constitutional right to due process requires that the State prove\n\nthe fitness of offenders for commitment beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       Aruanno’s position is flatly inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent governing\n\ntraditional civil commitment statutes, which holds that a State need only prove the\n\ndangerousness of a potential committee by clear and convincing evidence. See Foucha v.\n\nLouisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 433 (1979).\n\nIndeed, in Addington the Supreme Court considered and expressly rejected the argument\n\nthat the “beyond the reasonable doubt” standard applicable to criminal cases governs in\n\ncivil commitment proceedings. Id. at 427-31. Accordingly, this claim fails.\n\n                                         5. Jury Trial\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f       Aruanno argues that the SVPA violates the requirements of constitutional due\n\nprocess in that it fails to require that a jury trial be held in order for the State to effect\n\ncommitment.\n\n       Although Aruanno’s brief insists that a sex offender must be afforded the right to a\n\njury trial before his involuntary commitment, many of our sister circuits have held to the\n\ncontrary. For example, in United States v. Carta, 592 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 2010), the First\n\nCircuit noted that “the claim to a jury trial right in civil commitments has been rejected\n\nunder not only the Due Process Clause, but also the Sixth and Seventh Amendments.” Id.\n\nat 43 (internal citations omitted). Accord Poole v. Goodno, 335 F.3d 705, 710-11 (8th\n\nCir. 2003); United States v. Sahhar, 917 F.2d 1197, 1205-07 (9th Cir.1990).11 Cf.\n\nHernandez-Carrera v. Carlson, 547 F.3d 1237, 1256 (10th Cir. 2008) (upholding\n\nadministrative interpretation of statute regarding detention of certain aliens that did not\n\nprovide for right to jury trial).\n\n       The SVPA serves a regulatory—rather than penal—purpose, because it seeks to\n\nprotect the public from possible future harm rather than to punish for criminal acts\n\ncommitted in the past. We therefore join our sister circuits in holding that the\n\n\n\n       11\n         It should be noted that the federal analogue authorizing the commitment of\n“sexually dangerous persons” does not provide for a jury trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 4248;\nUnited States v. Veltman, 9 F.3d 718, 721 (8th Cir. 1993) (observing this feature of the\nfederal statute). We further note that the Supreme Court has recently affirmed Congress’\nauthority to enact § 4248 under the Necessary and Proper Clause, although the decision did not\naddress the claims asserted by Aruanno here. See United States v. Comstock, – U.S. – , – S.Ct. –\n, 2010 WL 1946729 (May 17, 2010).\n\n                                                15\n\fConstitution does not demand that a jury trial be provided before an individual is\n\ninvoluntarily committed by the state as a sexually dangerous person.\n\n                                            III.\n\n       We conclude that the District Court did not err in granting the State’s Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Aruanno’s complaint. We will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fMcKee, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n       I agree with my colleagues’ rejection of all of Aruanno’s claims with the single\n\nexception of his claim that he was denied procedural due process because he was not given\n\nnotice prior to his commitment. Aruanno alleges that “the ex parte order of temporary\n\ndetention was obtained without notice to plaintiff . . . at a time when plaintiff was in the\n\ncustody of the State of New Jersey, when no good cause or reasonable justification existed\n\nthat would make it unreasonable or impractical to provide plaintiff with advance notice.”\n\n(J.A. 91).\n\n       Our review of the Defendants’ motion to dismiss is plenary, and we must accept all\n\nfactual allegations and the inferences that can be drawn from them as true. Nami v. Favuer,\n\n82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir. 1996).    For the reasons set forth below, I believe that Aruanno’s\n\npreliminary commitment pursuant to the S.V.P. without prior notice is a violation of due\n\nprocess absent extenuating circumstances that are not present here.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       At the outset, I think it important to note that my colleagues place far too much\n\nemphasis on the fact that Aruanno’s commitment was a civil proceeding. See Maj. Op. at\n\n8 to 11. In Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980), the Supreme Court had to determine\n\n“whether the involuntary transfer of a Nebraska state prisoner to a mental hospital implicates\n\na liberty interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause.” Id., at 488. In finding such\n\na protected liberty interest under the Due Process Clause the Court explained: “[i]f the state\n\n\n\n                                              1\n\fgrants a prisoner a right or expectation that adverse action will not be taken against him\n\nexcept upon the occurrence of specified behavior, the determination of whether such\n\nbehavior has occurred becomes critical, and the minimum requirements of procedural due\n\nprocess are appropriate.” Id., at 490 (internal quotations omitted). The Supreme Court thus\n\nagreed with the district court’s determination that the transfer “should not be imposed\n\nwithout the opportunity for notice and an adequate hearing.” Id. At 491.\n\n       I agree with the majority’s conclusion that Aruanno’s transfer was civil in nature, just\n\nas the transfer in Vitek was. It is nevertheless clear that, absent some emergency justifying\n\na post-deprivation hearing, due process requires notice prior to even a temporary involuntary\n\ncommitment. “The notice requirement . . . no more than recognizes that notice is central to\n\nafford the prisoner an opportunity to . . . understand what is happening to him.” Id. at 496.\n\nThe risk of error in making commitment determinations, particularly where medicine and\n\npsychiatry are involved, warrants appropriate procedural safeguards against error. Id.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       Thus, absent exigent circumstances, no justification exists for denying Aruanno his\n\ndue process right to notice prior to his involuntary commitment under the S.V.P. In affirming\n\nthe district court’s dismissal here, the majority relies in part on Reese v. Nelson, 598 F.2d 822\n\n(3d Cir. 1979) and the New Jersey Superior Court’s analysis of N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.32.\n\nHowever, Reese can readily be distinguished from the circumstances here. Reese had made\n\nseveral credible threats against the government. He even went as telling authorities the\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fprecise date on which he was going to detonate a bomb. Nevertheless, he was still afforded\n\nprior notice (albeit only 1 hour), and a hearing before commitment was ordered. No such\n\nemergency has even been alleged here. The distinction is even more remarkable because\n\nReese had been released to out-patient treatment and was at large in the community at the\n\ntime of his commitment.     Aruanno was securely confined as an inmate in a New Jersey\n\nprison facility.\n\n       In In re Commitment of M.G., 751 A. 2d 1101 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 2000) the New\n\nJersey Superior Court concluded that unless exigent circumstances exist, procedural due\n\nprocess requires that persons who are subject to commitment proceedings receive notice and\n\na hearing prior to commitment. There is only a very limited exception that:\n\n       applies in emergency situations, in which the individual is at large in the\n       community or in custody and is believed to be an immediate danger to self,\n       others, or property. The temporal nature of the individual’s immediate\n       condition is the critical element in assessing due process considerations, [and]\n       immediate action without notice based on emergent circumstances is the\n       exception rather than the rule.\n\n751 A. 2d at 1107. (Emphasis in original).\n\n       Aruanno was initially ordered to be temporarily committed under the provisions of the\n\nSVPA. My colleagues stress that “[t]he SVPA provides that the subject of a temporary\n\ncommitment order is entitled to a hearing within twenty days of entry of the order, . . .” See\n\nMaj. Op. at 12. However, the Supreme Court of New Jersey has held that a statutory\n\nprovision requiring even earlier notice did not provide adequate due process.\n\n       In In H.E.S. v. J.C.S., 815 A.2d 405 (N.J. 2003), the New Jersey Supreme Court\n\n                                              3\n\fassessed the validity of a provision of New Jersey’s Domestic Violence Act that required a\n\n“final hearing . . . ‘within 10 days of . . . filing a complaint,’” following imposition of ex\n\nparte restraints, but allowed for a continuance “where fundamental fairness dictates allowing\n\na defendant additional time.” Id., at 413. In assessing the constitutionality of that provision,\n\nthe Court stated: “Indeed, to the extent that compliance with the ten-day provision precludes\n\nmeaningful notice and an opportunity to defend, the provision must yield to due process.” Id.\n\n(Citing In re Commitment of M.G.).\n\n       It is clear that post-deprivation hearings are appropriate and constitutionally\n\npermissible in emergency situations where there is no realistic opportunity to afford prior\n\nnotice to one whom the state wants to involuntarily commit. That is simply not the situation\n\nhere, and no one is arguing that it is. The majority claims that Aruanno “does not cite any\n\nauthority for the proposition that he is entitled to an earlier hearing, notice of the temporary\n\ncommitment order, or to counsel before the 20-day preliminary hearing.” See Maj. Op. at 12.\n\nHowever, we are reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim. His\n\ncomplaint clearly does state such a claim. My colleagues preface the aforementioned quote\n\nwith a citation to Greenfield v New Jersey Dept. Of Corrections, 888 A.2d 507 (N.J. Super\n\nCt. App. Div. 2006). That case supports Aruanno’s claim, not my colleagues’ rejection of\n\nit.\n\n       In Greenfield, an inmate challenged the denial of an opportunity to review the report\n\nthat he anticipated the state Attorney General would submit upon the expiration of his\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fsentence as the inmate believed he would then be detained pursuant to the SVPA. He also\n\nasked to meet with the committee (the IRC) that determined if referral for subsequent\n\ncommitment under the SVPA was appropriate. The request was denied, and he appealed the\n\ndenial of his request by the Department of Corrections. Thus, the court was only reviewing\n\nthe “defendant’s claim of a right to be heard when the IRC first evaluates him for possible\n\nreferral to the Attorney General as a candidate for civil commitment.” 888 A.2d at 510.\n\n(Emphasis added). Moreover, in affirming the denial of the inmate’s request, the court was\n\ncareful to note the limited scope of its ruling:\n\n       We emphasize the scope of this appeal is quite narrow. It focuses on plaintiff’s\n       assertion that the denial of his request constitutes a due process deprivation.\n       There is no doubt that due process requires the opportunity to be heard ‘at a\n       meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\n\n888 A.2d at 510 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Aruanno is not asking to\n\nmeet with the evaluation committee, to review its report, or be present when he is first\n\nevaluated for referral under the SVPA. He is merely asking for advance notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard before he is committed.           That is a basic component of the\n\nfundamental fairness guaranteed under the Due Process Clause.\n\n       In re Commitment of M.M., 894 A.2d 1158 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2006) which\n\nthe majority also cites, see Maj.Op. At 12, is not to the contrary. There, the plaintiff appealed\n\nfrom an order that continued her temporary commitment beyond the twenty-day period\n\nprovided for under the statute. She alleged that the government had not established\n\n“exceptional circumstances and good cause justifying the delay or adequate proof that she\n\n                                               5\n\fwas a person in need of involuntary commitment.” Id., at 1163. The court there, did state\n\nthat: “[t]he twenty-day period for pre-hearing detention is deemed constitutionally reasonable\n\nbecause of the urgency at its inception and in order to permit time for preparations essential\n\nto a fair and meaningful hearing. . ..” as the majority notes at page 12 of its opinion.\n\nHowever, my colleagues fail to note that the court struck down the preliminary order\n\nchallenged in M.M. for the very same reasons that underlie Aruanno’s challenge to his lack\n\nof notice.\n\n       A more complete recitation of quotations from the decision in M.M. removes any\n\ndoubt about the unconstitutionality of preliminary commitment in the absence of an adequate\n\nshowing of necessity. The court in M.M. explained: “[b]ecause the patient’s liberty is at\n\nstake, meticulous adherence to statutory and constitutional criteria is required.” 894 A.2d at\n\n1167 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The court observed that even though\n\nthe law allowed for commitment without a prior hearing based upon a showing of probable\n\ncause, “it also recognizes that it is exceptional to deprive a person of liberty prior to a hearing\n\non the need for such extraordinary restraint. . . . Our cases recognize that this pre-hearing\n\nconfinement is justified only because of the urgency of the threat of serious harm . . ..” Id.\n\n(Internal citations omitted). It was only at that point in its discussion that the court made the\n\nstatement relied that the majority cites.    Thereafter, the court cautioned that such pre-\n\nhearing deprivation is justified only by “exceptional circumstances,” and “good cause” and\n\nthe court held that “trial courts must take a narrow view of the circumstances that qualify as\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f“exceptional’ and establish “good cause.’”. Id., at 1168. The court reversed the order\n\nallowing the extension of the plaintiff’s preliminary detention because the judge who entered\n\nthe order “did not even consider whether there were exceptional circumstances and good\n\ncause warranting extensions of the statutory period.” Id., at 1169. As I have already noted,\n\nneither exceptional circumstances nor good cause are even alleged here.\n\n       Moreover, it is no small irony that M.M. at least had the benefit of some process\n\nbefore the court extended the statutory deadline for a hearing on her civil commitment.\n\nGiven Aruanno’s allegations, we must assume that he did not have any process at all. I\n\ntherefore can not agree that Aruanno’s preliminary commitment comports with “‘meticulous\n\nadherence to [the] . . . ‘constitutional criteria’ [that] is required” when “the patient’s liberty\n\nis at stake.” Id., at 1167.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f",

In 1994, while in Florida, he\n\nexposed himself to two adolescent girls as they were walking home from school and\n\nengaged in lewd conduct in their presence. As a result of this incident, Aruanno pled\n\nguilty to second-degree lewd conduct, and was sentenced to ten years’ probation. J.A. 46.\n\nJust two years later, in 1996, Aruanno sexually molested an eight-year-old girl who had\n\nbeen playing on the front steps of her house in Wildwood, New Jersey. A jury convicted\n\nAruanno of second-degree sexual assault, and he was sentenced to ten years in prison, and\n\ndisqualification from parole for five years. J.A. 47. The Appellate Division of the New\n\nJersey Superior Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The New Jersey Supreme\n\nCourt denied certification. State v. Aruanno, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. 2002) (table op.).\n\n          In April 2004, while Aruanno was still serving his prison sentence, the State of\n\nNew Jersey (hereinfter “the State”) filed a petition to involuntarily commit Aruanno\n\npursuant to the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predator Act (“SVPA”), N.J.S.A. § 30:4-\n\n27.24 et seq. Partially due to Aruanno’s repeated insistence that he be appointed new\n\ncounsel, a hearing on the petition was not held until May 9, 2005, and Aruanno was\n\ndetained until that time pursuant to a temporary commitment order.

Dr. Shnaidman testified that Aruanno was a chronic paranoid\n\nschizophrenic, but her diagnosis explicitly ruled out diagnoses of exhibitionism and\n\npedophilia. J.A. 54. Nevertheless, Dr. Shnaidman opined that Aruanno’s schizophrenia,\n\nwhen combined with his previous violent conduct, created a “very high” risk of future\n\nviolence. J.A. 55. In particular, because Aruanno refused to take psychotropic\n\nmedication to treat his schizophrenia, he would continue to suffer from psychotic\n\ndelusions which would render sex offender treatment useless. According to Dr.\n\nShnaidman, Aruanno would have serious difficulty controlling his sexually predatory\n\nbehavior without undergoing treatment for his schizophrenia. J.A. 55-56.\n\n       Aruanno testified on his own behalf at the hearing. He denied committing either\n\nthe Florida or the New Jersey offense, and testified that he believed the State had filed the\n\ncommitment petition in retribution for his decision to go to trial for the New Jersey\n\noffense, rather than accepting a deal to plead guilty. J.A. 51. Aruanno was also given the\n\nopportunity to present the testimony of his own psychologist, but after meeting with\n\nAruanno, the psychologist reported that he was “unable to render an opinion to a\n\nreasonable degree of medical certainty.” J.A. 54.\n\n       The state court found that Aruanno suffered from a mental abnormality which\n\ncreated “substantial, significant, severe difficulty controlling his sexually violent\n\nbehavior,” and granted the State’s petition for involuntary commitment. J.A. 58.\n\nAruanno appealed the order, and the Appellate Division affirmed.

We conclude that the\n\nstate action prescribed by the SVPA is genuinely civil in nature, Aruanno’s claims\n\nregarding the act’s constitutionality are unavailing, and the District Court did not err in\n\ndismissing them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).8\n\n\n(3d Cir. 2008).\n\n\n        8\n        In fact, the SVPA is a civil, not criminal, statute. The SVPA allows a court to\nauthorize temporary commitment based on an ex parte submission made by the Attorney\nGeneral, N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.28(g), but requires that any person so committed be afforded\n\n                                              8\n\f                               1. SVPA: Civil or Criminal?\n\n       In determining whether the SVPA should be properly categorized civil or criminal\n\nin nature, we are guided by the Supreme Court’s analysis in Kansas v. Hendricks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). In Hendricks, the Supreme Court considered various constitutional\n\nchallenges to a statute enacted by the State of Kansas which provided for the involuntary\n\nconfinement of persons classified as “sexually violent predators.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 59-\n\n29a01 et seq. (2009).9\n\n       The Hendricks Court began its analysis of the Kansas statute at issue (hereinafter\n\n\n\na hearing within twenty days of the commitment order. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.29(a). The\nmaximum length of commitment that may result before a hearing and the participation of\nthe offender/defendant is therefore twenty days.\n\n       Moreover, in the case of an inmate scheduled for release, like Aruanno, the\ntemporary commitment is accomplished by the submission of two statements prepared by\nmedical professionals, one of whom must be a psychiatrist, certifying that he is a sexually\nviolent predator in need of involuntary commitment. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.28(c).\n\n       Indeed, In re Commitment of M.M., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2354270\"><a href=\"/opinion/2354270/in-re-commitment-of-mm/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J.

Vitek merely held that a prisoner is entitled to due process\nprotections before being transferred to a psychiatric facility.\n\n      As noted in text, we have followed Kansas v.

Stat. Ann. § 59-29a01 et seq.\n\n                                              9\n\f“K-SVPA”) with an examination of “whether the legislature meant the statute to establish\n\n‘civil’ proceedings.” 521 U.S. at 361. The Court observed the K-SVPA’s placement in\n\nthe Kansas probate code rather than the criminal code, and the Kansas legislature’s own\n\nreference to the legislation as creating a “civil commitment procedure.” Id. The Court\n\nsuggested that the statute served neither of the two primary objectives of criminal\n\npunishment – not retribution because the statute did not “affix culpability for prior\n\ncriminal conduct” or require a finding of scienter – and not deterrence because by\n\ndefinition, committees suffered from “mental abnormality” which prevented them from\n\ncontrolling their behavior. Id. at 362.\n\n       Next, the Court rejected Hendricks’ contentions that the potentially indefinite\n\nlength of his commitment and the presence of certain procedural protections more\n\ntypically found in criminal statutes rendered the proceedings essentially criminal. Id. at\n\n363-65. Finally, the Court was unpersuaded by Hendricks’ argument that the statute’s\n\nfailure to provide treatment for committed offenders revealed its criminal character.\n\n       The Court concluded:\n\n              Where the State has disavowed any punitive intent; limited confinement to a\n              small segment of particularly dangerous individuals; provided strict\n              procedural safeguards; directed that confined persons be segregated from\n              the general prison population and afforded the same status as others who\n              have been civilly committed; recommended treatment if such is possible;\n              and permitted immediate release upon a showing that the individual is no\n              longer dangerous or mentally impaired, we cannot say that it acted with\n              punitive intent. We therefore hold that the Act does not establish criminal\n              proceedings and that involuntary confinement under the Act is not punitive.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fId. at 368-69.\n\n       Like the K-SVPA, the SVPA is not part of New Jersey’s criminal code,10 and the\n\nlanguage of the statute describes its procedure as a civil commitment process which\n\nrecognizes “the need for commitment of those sexually violent predators who pose a\n\ndanger to others should they be returned to society.” N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.25(c). Although\n\nthis label is not entirely dispositive, it places the burden on Aruanno to provide “the\n\nclearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to\n\nnegate the State’s intention to deem it civil.” Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 361 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110331\"><a href=\"/opinion/110331/united-states-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248-49 (1980)) (alterations and internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       Aruanno cannot meet this burden. Although facilities housing committed sex\n\noffenders are managed by the Department of Corrections, the SVPA requires that\n\noffenders subject to civil commitment be housed separately from offenders under the\n\ngeneral supervision of the Department of Corrections. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.34(a). The\n\nSVPA also requires that the Department of Human Services provide treatment that is\n\n“appropriately tailored to address the specific needs of sexually violent predators.”\n\nN.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.34(b).\n\n       Finally, like the K-SVPA, the SVPA provides for reevaluation of involuntarily\n\ncommitted persons every year. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.35. Committees may also be\n\n\n\n       10\n            Title 30 of the New Jersey Statutes is captioned “Institutions and Agencies.”\n\n                                               11\n\fauthorized by members of the treatment staff to file a petition for discharge from\n\ninvoluntary commitment. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.36.\n\n       Under the framework established in Hendricks, we hold that the New Jersey SVPA\n\nserves an essentially regulatory civil function. Having thus established the proper context\n\nin which to evaluate the constitutionality of the SVPA, we now proceed to analyze the\n\nmerits of Aruanno’s four challenges to its procedures.\n\n                         2. Ex Parte Temporary Detention Order\n\n       Aruanno argues that his rights were violated when the court entered a temporary\n\ndetention order pending his final commitment hearing without first appointing counsel for\n\nAruanno, and without holding a hearing in which Aruanno might challenge the temporary\n\ndetention.\n\n       The SVPA provides that the subject of a temporary commitment order is entitled to\n\na hearing within twenty days of entry of the order, and that the person subject to\n\ncommitment must be represented by counsel at that hearing. N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.29; see\n\nGreenfield v. New Jersey Dept. of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/2112935/greenfield-v-nj-dept-of-corr/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\n\nDiv. 2006). Aruanno does not cite any authority for the proposition that he is entitled to\n\nan earlier hearing, notice of the temporary commitment order, or to counsel before the 20-\n\nday preliminary hearing. As the New Jersey Superior Court has reasoned: “The twenty-\n\nday period for pre-hearing detention is deemed constitutionally reasonable because of the\n\nurgency at its inception and in order to permit time for preparations essential to a fair and\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fmeaningful hearing.

Use of Information Elicited from Aruanno\n\n       Aruanno complains that his constitutional rights were violated when the State used\n\ninformation elicited from him to support its case for Aruanno’s commitment, even though\n\nAruanno had not been warned that the information could be used against him at the\n\ncommitment hearing, and he had not been given an opportunity to consult with or be\n\nrepresented by counsel before the information was elicited. Though Aruanno’s brief does\n\nnot expressly reference the Fifth Amendment, the substance of his argument indicates that\n\nhe believes the SVPA violates his constitutional right against self-incrimination, and we\n\nwill analyze his claim on that basis.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause, by its own terms, applies only\n\nto criminal cases.

Aruanno alleges that “the ex parte order of temporary\n\ndetention was obtained without notice to plaintiff . . . at a time when plaintiff was in the\n\ncustody of the State of New Jersey, when no good cause or reasonable justification existed\n\nthat would make it unreasonable or impractical to provide plaintiff with advance notice.”\n\n(J.A. 91).\n\n       Our review of the Defendants’ motion to dismiss is plenary, and we must accept all\n\nfactual allegations and the inferences that can be drawn from them as true.

For the reasons set forth below, I believe that Aruanno’s\n\npreliminary commitment pursuant to the S.V.P. without prior notice is a violation of due\n\nprocess absent extenuating circumstances that are not present here.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       At the outset, I think it important to note that my colleagues place far too much\n\nemphasis on the fact that Aruanno’s commitment was a civil proceeding. See Maj. Op. at\n\n8 to 11. In Vitek v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110231\"><a href=\"/opinion/110231/vitek-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980), the Supreme Court had to determine\n\n“whether the involuntary transfer of a Nebraska state prisoner to a mental hospital implicates\n\na liberty interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause.” Id., at 488. In finding such\n\na protected liberty interest under the Due Process Clause the Court explained: “[i]f the state\n\n\n\n                                              1\n\fgrants a prisoner a right or expectation that adverse action will not be taken against him\n\nexcept upon the occurrence of specified behavior, the determination of whether such\n\nbehavior has occurred becomes critical, and the minimum requirements of procedural due\n\nprocess are appropriate.” Id., at 490 (internal quotations omitted). The Supreme Court thus\n\nagreed with the district court’s determination that the transfer “should not be imposed\n\nwithout the opportunity for notice and an adequate hearing.” Id. At 491.\n\n       I agree with the majority’s conclusion that Aruanno’s transfer was civil in nature, just\n\nas the transfer in Vitek was. It is nevertheless clear that, absent some emergency justifying\n\na post-deprivation hearing, due process requires notice prior to even a temporary involuntary\n\ncommitment. “The notice requirement . . . no more than recognizes that notice is central to\n\nafford the prisoner an opportunity to . . . understand what is happening to him.” Id. at 496.\n\nThe risk of error in making commitment determinations, particularly where medicine and\n\npsychiatry are involved, warrants appropriate procedural safeguards against error. Id.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       Thus, absent exigent circumstances, no justification exists for denying Aruanno his\n\ndue process right to notice prior to his involuntary commitment under the S.V.P. In affirming\n\nthe district court’s dismissal here, the majority relies in part on Reese v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"366302\"><a href=\"/opinion/366302/paul-a-reese-v-stanley-m-nelson-john-ahlfeld-benjamin-f-weaver-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(3d Cir. 1979) and the New Jersey Superior Court’s analysis of N.J.S.A. § 30:4-27.32.\n\nHowever, Reese can readily be distinguished from the circumstances here. Reese had made\n\nseveral credible threats against the government. He even went as telling authorities the\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fprecise date on which he was going to detonate a bomb. Nevertheless, he was still afforded\n\nprior notice (albeit only 1 hour), and a hearing before commitment was ordered. No such\n\nemergency has even been alleged here. The distinction is even more remarkable because\n\nReese had been released to out-patient treatment and was at large in the community at the\n\ntime of his commitment.     Aruanno was securely confined as an inmate in a New Jersey\n\nprison facility.\n\n       In In re Commitment of M.G., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2196726\"><a href=\"/opinion/2196726/in-re-commitment-of-mg/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. Super. App. Div. 2000) the New\n\nJersey Superior Court concluded that unless exigent circumstances exist, procedural due\n\nprocess requires that persons who are subject to commitment proceedings receive notice and\n\na hearing prior to commitment. There is only a very limited exception that:\n\n       applies in emergency situations, in which the individual is at large in the\n       community or in custody and is believed to be an immediate danger to self,\n       others, or property. The temporal nature of the individual’s immediate\n       condition is the critical element in assessing due process considerations, [and]\n       immediate action without notice based on emergent circumstances is the\n       exception rather than the rule.\n\n751 A. 2d at 1107. (Emphasis in original).\n\n       Aruanno was initially ordered to be temporarily committed under the provisions of the\n\nSVPA. My colleagues stress that “[t]he SVPA provides that the subject of a temporary\n\ncommitment order is entitled to a hearing within twenty days of entry of the order, . . .” See\n\nMaj. Op. at 12. However, the Supreme Court of New Jersey has held that a statutory\n\nprovision requiring even earlier notice did not provide adequate due process.\n\n       In In H.E.S. v. J.C.S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2070086\"><a href=\"/opinion/2070086/hes-v-jcs/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. 2003), the New Jersey Supreme Court\n\n                                              3\n\fassessed the validity of a provision of New Jersey’s Domestic Violence Act that required a\n\n“final hearing . . . ‘within 10 days of . . . filing a complaint,’” following imposition of ex\n\nparte restraints, but allowed for a continuance “where fundamental fairness dictates allowing\n\na defendant additional time.” Id., at 413. In assessing the constitutionality of that provision,\n\nthe Court stated: “Indeed, to the extent that compliance with the ten-day provision precludes\n\nmeaningful notice and an opportunity to defend, the provision must yield to due process.” Id.\n\n(Citing In re Commitment of M.G.).\n\n       It is clear that post-deprivation hearings are appropriate and constitutionally\n\npermissible in emergency situations where there is no realistic opportunity to afford prior\n\nnotice to one whom the state wants to involuntarily commit. That is simply not the situation\n\nhere, and no one is arguing that it is. The majority claims that Aruanno “does not cite any\n\nauthority for the proposition that he is entitled to an earlier hearing, notice of the temporary\n\ncommitment order, or to counsel before the 20-day preliminary hearing.” See Maj. Op. at 12.\n\nHowever, we are reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim. His\n\ncomplaint clearly does state such a claim. My colleagues preface the aforementioned quote\n\nwith a citation to Greenfield v New Jersey Dept. Of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/2112935/greenfield-v-nj-dept-of-corr/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. Super\n\nCt. App. Div. 2006). That case supports Aruanno’s claim, not my colleagues’ rejection of\n\nit.\n\n       In Greenfield, an inmate challenged the denial of an opportunity to review the report\n\nthat he anticipated the state Attorney General would submit upon the expiration of his\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fsentence as the inmate believed he would then be detained pursuant to the SVPA. He also\n\nasked to meet with the committee (the IRC) that determined if referral for subsequent\n\ncommitment under the SVPA was appropriate. The request was denied, and he appealed the\n\ndenial of his request by the Department of Corrections. Thus, the court was only reviewing\n\nthe “defendant’s claim of a right to be heard when the IRC first evaluates him for possible\n\nreferral to the Attorney General as a candidate for civil commitment.” 888 A.2d at 510.\n\n(Emphasis added). Moreover, in affirming the denial of the inmate’s request, the court was\n\ncareful to note the limited scope of its ruling:\n\n       We emphasize the scope of this appeal is quite narrow. It focuses on plaintiff’s\n       assertion that the denial of his request constitutes a due process deprivation.\n       There is no doubt that due process requires the opportunity to be heard ‘at a\n       meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\n\n888 A.2d at 510 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Aruanno is not asking to\n\nmeet with the evaluation committee, to review its report, or be present when he is first\n\nevaluated for referral under the SVPA. He is merely asking for advance notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard before he is committed.           That is a basic component of the\n\nfundamental fairness guaranteed under the Due Process Clause.\n\n       In re Commitment of M.M., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2354270\"><a href=\"/opinion/2354270/in-re-commitment-of-mm/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2006) which\n\nthe majority also cites, see Maj.Op. At 12, is not to the contrary. There, the plaintiff appealed\n\nfrom an order that continued her temporary commitment beyond the twenty-day period\n\nprovided for under the statute. She alleged that the government had not established\n\n“exceptional circumstances and good cause justifying the delay or adequate proof that she\n\n                                               5\n\fwas a person in need of involuntary commitment.” Id., at 1163. The court there, did state\n\nthat: “[t]he twenty-day period for pre-hearing detention is deemed constitutionally reasonable\n\nbecause of the urgency at its inception and in order to permit time for preparations essential\n\nto a fair and meaningful hearing. . ..” as the majority notes at page 12 of its opinion.\n\nHowever, my colleagues fail to note that the court struck down the preliminary order\n\nchallenged in M.M. for the very same reasons that underlie Aruanno’s challenge to his lack\n\nof notice.\n\n       A more complete recitation of quotations from the decision in M.M. removes any\n\ndoubt about the unconstitutionality of preliminary commitment in the absence of an adequate\n\nshowing of necessity. The court in M.M. explained: “[b]ecause the patient’s liberty is at\n\nstake, meticulous adherence to statutory and constitutional criteria is required.” 894 A.2d at\n\n1167 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The court observed that even though\n\nthe law allowed for commitment without a prior hearing based upon a showing of probable\n\ncause, “it also recognizes that it is exceptional to deprive a person of liberty prior to a hearing\n\non the need for such extraordinary restraint. . . . Our cases recognize that this pre-hearing\n\nconfinement is justified only because of the urgency of the threat of serious harm . . ..” Id.\n\n(Internal citations omitted). It was only at that point in its discussion that the court made the\n\nstatement relied that the majority cites.    Thereafter, the court cautioned that such pre-\n\nhearing deprivation is justified only by “exceptional circumstances,” and “good cause” and\n\nthe court held that “trial courts must take a narrow view of the circumstances that qualify as\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f“exceptional’ and establish “good cause.’”. Id., at 1168. The court reversed the order\n\nallowing the extension of the plaintiff’s preliminary detention because the judge who entered\n\nthe order “did not even consider whether there were exceptional circumstances and good\n\ncause warranting extensions of the statutory period.” Id., at 1169. As I have already noted,\n\nneither exceptional circumstances nor good cause are even alleged here.\n\n       Moreover, it is no small irony that M.M. at least had the benefit of some process\n\nbefore the court extended the statutory deadline for a hearing on her civil commitment.\n\nGiven Aruanno’s allegations, we must assume that he did not have any process at all. I\n\ntherefore can not agree that Aruanno’s preliminary commitment comports with “‘meticulous\n\nadherence to [the] . . . ‘constitutional criteria’ [that] is required” when “the patient’s liberty\n\nis at stake.” Id., at 1167.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f</pre>",
