Galley, the Warden of RCI (collectively Appel-\nlees), alleging that Appellees violated Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA), see 42 U.S.C.A.§§ 12131-12165 (West 1995\n& Supp. 1997); and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, see 29\nU.S.C.A. § 794 (West Supp. 1997). This case was originally before\nthe Court on appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of\nAppellees. Based on our analysis of the statutes under the clear state-\nment rule, and in light of our decision in Torcasio v. Murray, 57 F.3d\n1340 (4th Cir. 1995), we found that the ADA and the Rehabilitation\nAct do not apply to state prisons. We affirmed the judgment of the\ndistrict court, see Amos v. Md. Dept. of Pub. Safety & Corr. Serv., 126\nF.3d 589 (4th Cir. 1997) (Amos I), and Appellants petitioned the\nSupreme Court of the United States for certiorari. On June 22, 1998,\nthe Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated our opinion in Amos I,\nand remanded in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\nPennsylvania Dept. of Corr. v. Yeskey, 118 S.Ct. 1952 (1998). See\nAmos v. Md. Dept. of Pub. Safety & Corr. Serv., 118 U.S. 2339 (1998).1\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Appellants also brought claims based on alleged violations of their\nconstitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment of the United States\n\n                    3\n\fI.\n\nIn Yeskey, a state prisoner had been denied admission to a Motiva-\ntional Boot Camp Program because of his medical history of hyper-\ntension. The Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's opinion that\nthe ADA does apply to state prisons, stating explicitly that Congress\ndrafted the ADA in unambiguous terms. Based on the unambiguous\ntext of the statute, the Court held that Congress clearly intended to\ninclude state prisons within the scope of the ADA. See Yeskey, 118\nS.Ct. at 1953-54. Although the Court ruled that Congress intended for\nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act to apply to state prisons, the Court\nexpressly declined to rule on the issue of whether application of the\nADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congress' legisla-\ntive power, either under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or the\nCommerce Clause. Id. at 1956.\n\nBy Order of July 10, 1998, after this Court regained jurisdiction\nover Amos I on remand, we directed both parties to file supplemental\nbriefs addressing the issue of the constitutionality of the application\nof the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to state prisons. Both Appellants\nand Appellees, as well as the United States as intervenor and several\namicus curiae, filed briefs addressing the issue. 2 Being bound to reject\n_________________________________________________________________\nConstitution. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\nAppellees on that claim, as well, and we affirmed. See Amos I, 126 F.3d\nat 611. Since Appellants did not petition the Supreme Court for certiorari\non this Court's ruling on the Eighth Amendment claims, these claims are\nno longer before the Court and will not be addressed further.\n2 Although the issue of the constitutionality of applying the ADA and\nRehabilitation Act to state prisons was not raised below, we exercise our\nlimited discretion to consider the issue on appeal in light of the fact that\nthe constitutionality of this federal statute is purely a question of law,\nboth parties have fully briefed the issue, and its resolution at this stage\nwill advance and expedite the progress of this litigation. See United\nStates v. Presley, 52 F.3d 64, 67 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 891\n(1995); Pinney Dock & Transport Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., 838 F.2d\n1445, 1461 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 880 (1988) (when resolution\nof issue not presented below will \"materially advance the progress of\n[the] already protracted litigation, [courts of appeal] should address it\" if\nthe issue has been \"presented with sufficient clarity and completeness\");\nHormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 557 (1941) (court of appeals has dis-\ncretion to deviate from normal rule of procedure and hear issues not\nraised below in exceptional cases or particular circumstances).\n\n                    4\n\four panel's previous opinion in Amos I, and to follow instead the\ndirection of the Supreme Court,3 we must now base our analysis of\nthe statutes' constitutionality on the premise that Congress did intend\nfor the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to apply to state prisons.\nUnder such analysis, we hold that Congress did in fact act constitu-\ntionally when it enacted the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act pursuant\nto its enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment\nwith the intent that the statutes apply to state prisons.\n\nBefore we go further, however, we note that with our holding\ntoday, we continue to have our reservations, stated in Torcasio and\nAmos I, about the far-reaching and serious implications for the man-\nagement of state prisons that will result from application of these Acts\nto those institutions. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that\n\n          [i]t might seem absurd to apply the Americans with Disabil-\n          ities Act to prisoners. Prisoners are not a favored group in\n          society; the propensity of some of them to sue at the drop\n          of a hat is well known; prison systems are strapped for\n          funds; the practical effect of granting disabled prisoners\n          rights of access that might require costly modifications of\n          prison facilities might be the curtailment of educational, rec-\n          reational, and rehabilitative programs for prisoners, in which\n          event everyone might be worse off . . . .\n\nCrawford v. Indiana Dept. of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 486 (7th Cir.\n1997). Our job today, however, is simply to decide whether Congress,\nin pursuing its clear objective, exceeded its constitutional authority.\nSince we hold that Congress acted constitutionally under its Four-\nteenth Amendment enforcement powers, our opinion as to the pru-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 See Ethridge v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co., 9 F.3d 1087, 1090 (4th\nCir. 1993) (\"A decision of a panel of this court becomes the law of the\ncircuit and is binding on other panels unless it is overruled by a subse-\nquent en banc opinion of this court or a `superceding contrary decision\nof the Supreme Court'\") (quoting Busby v. Crown Supply, Inc., 896 F.2d\n833, 840-41 (4th Cir. 1990)).\n\n                    5\n\fdence of Congress' choice to make the statutes applicable to state\nprisons is irrelevant.4\n\nII.\n\nWhen Congress enacted the ADA, it \"invoke[d] the sweep of con-\ngressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth\namendment . . . in order to address the major areas of discrimination\nfaced day-to-day by people with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.A.\n§ 12101(b)(4) (West 1995). Thus, we begin our analysis with the\nEqual Protection Clause and § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, not-\ning, as we did in Amos I, that \"because Congress has directed that\nTitle II of the ADA be interpreted in a manner consistent with §504\nof the Rehabilitation Act, see 42 U.S.C.A.§§ 12134(b), 12201(a)\n(West 1995), we combine the analysis of the prisoners' ADA and\nRehabilitation Act claims.\" Amos I, 126 F.3d at 593, n.2 (citing\nShafer v. Preston Mem'l Hosp., 107 F.3d 274, 276, n.3 (4th Cir.\n1997); Doe v. University of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. , 50 F.3d 1261, 1264,\nn.9 (4th Cir. 1995); Tyndall v. National Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209,\n213, n.1 (4th Cir. 1994)). We also note that although § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act does not state explicitly that it was enacted pursu-\nant to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court has\nstated in dicta that \"[t]he Rehabilitation Act was passed pursuant to\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Welch v. Texas Dept. of High-\nways & Pub. Transp., 483 U.S. 468, 472, n.2 (1987) (citing\nAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 244-45, n.4\n(1985)).\n\nA.\n\nCongress has the power to protect classes of persons from arbitrary\ndiscrimination by the States. This power is rooted in the Equal Protec-\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 Also irrelevant to our determination of the statutes' constitutionality\nis the possibility of an increase in frivolous prisoner litigation. As the\nUnited States aptly states in its supplemental reply brief, \"Congress has\nelected to address that separate problem of frivolous prisoner suits by\nenacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110\nStat, 1321 (1996), instead of by excluding prisoners from the ADA's\nprotections.\" (Intervenor S. Reply Br. at 16, n.10).\n\n                    6\n\ftion Clause of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution which guarantees that no State shall\"deny to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The Supreme\nCourt has stated that the Equal Protection Clause\"is essentially a\ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\"\nCity of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985). The Supreme Court has specifically found that the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause protects the physically and mentally disabled from\narbitrary discrimination by the States, even though the disabled do not\nthemselves constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class of persons. Id.\nat 446.\n\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants to Congress the\npower to enforce the mandates of the Equal Protection Clause through\nlegislation that is aimed at remedying or preventing violations of the\nAmendment. This remedial power has traditionally been quite broad,\nnot only in the context of racial discrimination and voting rights, but\nin other areas of discrimination as well. See , e.g., City of Rome v.\nUnited States, 446 U.S. 156, reh'g denied , 447 U.S. 916 (1980);\nFitzpatrick v. Bitzner, 427 U.S. 445 (1976); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400\nU.S. 112 (1970), reh'g denied, 401 U.S. 903 (1971); Katzenbach v.\nMorgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383\nU.S. 301 (1966); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 345-46 (1879). In\nthe voting rights context, the Supreme Court has declared § 5 to be\n\"a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise\nits discretion in determining whether and what legislation is needed\nto secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Katzenbach\nv. Morgan, 384 U.S. at 651.\n\nCongress' enforcement power is not without limits, and the\nSupreme Court has recently attempted to define and clarify the limits\nof Congress' § 5 power in the case of City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\nU.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (1997), where the Court stated that under\n§ 5, \"Congress' discretion is not unlimited, however, and the courts\nretain the power, as they have since Marbury v. Madison, to deter-\nmine if Congress has exceeded its authority under the Constitution.\"\nBoerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2172. In Boerne, the Supreme Court struck down\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), see 42\nU.S.C.A. § 2000bb et seq. (West 1994 & Supp. 1998), an act which\nCongress passed pursuant to its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement\n\n                    7\n\fpowers, and in direct response to the Supreme Court's decision of\nEmployment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\nU.S. 872, reh'g denied, 496 U.S. 913 (1990). In Smith, the Court had\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not\nrequire States to justify by a compelling interest generally applicable,\nneutral laws that coincidentally burden religious practices. See Smith,\n494 U.S. at 884-86. Thus, Smith essentially lowered the standard for\njudicial review of generally applicable, neutral laws that burden reli-\ngion. In direct response to Smith, and in an attempt to remedy sup-\nposed harms to the free exercise of religion, Congress passed RFRA,\nwhich required all laws that burden a group's religion, even neutral\nlaws of general applicability, to be narrowly tailored and justified by\na compelling interest. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n\nIn striking down RFRA, the Supreme Court admonished that § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress only the power to\nenforce the Fourteenth Amendment and not the power to define the\nsubstance of the Amendment since \"[t]he design of the Amendment\nand the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress\nhas the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's\nrestrictions on the States.\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2164. Thus, Congress'\npower is remedial and not substantive in nature. The Boerne Court\nhad the foresight to recognize that distinguishing between laws that\nremedy or prevent unconstitutional conduct and laws that operate to\ndefine constitutional rights substantively is a difficult task, and in an\neffort to guide lower courts in analyzing laws passed under § 5, the\nCourt crafted its \"congruence and proportionality\" test for deciding\nwhether Congress has acted outside the scope of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In order for laws to qualify as remedial under the Four-\nteenth Amendment, according to Boerne, \"[t]here must be a congru-\nence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or\nremedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Id. (internal quotation\nand citation omitted). Thus, as the Tenth Circuit has aptly interpreted\nBoerne, \"[i]f the legislation at issue imposes burdens far greater than\nthe seriousness of any demonstrated constitutional injury requiring\nsuch measures, then the legislation does not remediate the constitu-\ntional violation but creates substantive change in constitutional pro-\ntections.\" Migneault v. Peck, 158 F.3d 1131, 1137 (10th Cir. 1998)\n(citing Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2163-70).\n\n                     8\n\fThe Court applied its congruence and proportionality test to RFRA\nand found that the broad sweeping and constitutionally demanding\ntests set up by RFRA totally lacked the necessary congruence and\nproportionality to the harm the statute purported to remedy. Finding\nno evidence in the record of \"modern instances of generally applica-\nble laws passed because of religious bigotry,\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at\n2169, the Court found the statute to be \"so out of proportion to a sup-\nposed remedial or preventative object that it cannot be understood as\nresponsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\" Id.\nat 2170. Thus, by creating substantive and not remedial legislation,\nCongress exceeded its remedial legislative powers under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\nSince Congress purported to exercise its Fourteenth Amendment\nenforcement powers when enacting the ADA, see 42 U.S.C.A.\n§ 12101(a)(7), (b)(4) (West 1995), we analyze the question of its con-\nstitutionality under Boerne's test for congruence and proportionality.\nHaving examined, among other things, the statute itself, portions of\nits legislative history, see 42 U.S.C. § 12101; S. Rep. No. 101-116,\nat 7-8 (1989); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 28-31 (1990); H.R.\nRep. No. 101-485, pt.1, at 24 (1990), and the opinions of our sister\ncircuits that have addressed the issue, see Crawford v. Indiana Dep't\nof Corrections, 115 F.3d 481 (7th Cir. 1997); Clark v. California, 123\nF.3d 1267 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S.Ct. 2340 (1998);\nCoolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 119\nS.Ct. 58 (1998); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents , 139 F.3d 1426 (11th\nCir. 1998), cert. granted, 67 U.S.L.W. 3464 (U.S. Jan. 25, 1999) (No.\n98-791); Seaborn v. Florida, 143 F.3d 1405 (11th Cir. 1998), cert.\ndenied, 119 S.Ct. 1038 (1999); see also Autio v. AFSCME Local\n3139, 157 F.3d 1141 (8th Cir. 1998) (en banc), we hold that Congress\ndid not exceed its authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment\nwhen it enacted the ADA to remedy discrimination against disabled\npersons, including disabled state prisoners.\n\nB.\n\nThe first question to be decided is whether the ADA, as enacted,\nis remedial or substantive in nature. We note again that the Supreme\nCourt has found that the Equal Protection Clause protects the physi-\ncally and mentally disabled from arbitrary discrimination by the\n\n                    9\n\fStates. City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446. It also protects prisoners\nfrom arbitrary discrimination. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84\n(1987) (\"Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates\nfrom the protections of the Constitution.\"). As the Seventh Circuit has\naptly noted, \"[a]lthough the special conditions of the prison setting\nlicense a degree of discrimination that would not be tolerated in a free\nenvironment, there is no general right of prison officials to discrimi-\nnate against prisoners on grounds of race, sex, religion, and so forth.\"\nCrawford, 115 F.3d at 486 (7th Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted).\nThus, if arbitrary discrimination against disabled inmates exists, then\nCongress has the power to enact legislation that remedies or prevents\nsuch violations of disabled inmates' equal protection rights.\n\nWhen enacting the ADA, Congress made several findings of both\npast and present discrimination against the disabled in the country's\ngeneral population that it determined violated the Equal Protection\nClause. See 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2)-(a)(3), (a)(5)-(a)(6); H.R.Rep.\nNo. 101-485, pt.2, at 22, 30, 42 (1990), reprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 303, 311-12, 324. Congress determined that \"the\nexclusion of persons with disabilities from government facilities, pro-\ngrams, and benefits was a result of past and on-going discrimination.\"\n(Intervenor S. Br. at 18). We are compelled to give some deference\nto the record of Congress' factual findings, and to Congress' determi-\nnation that the ADA is an appropriate remedy to the harms it found\nto exist. We reiterate the Supreme Court's observation that \"the line\nbetween measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and\nmeasures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not\neasy to discern\" and as such \"Congress must have wide latitude in\ndetermining where it lies. . . .\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2164. Further,\nwith respect to the disabled, the Court has stated that \"[h]ow this large\nand diversified group is to be treated under the law is a difficult and\noften a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by\nqualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions\nof the judiciary.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 442-43. Thus, while\nwe are mindful that our deference to the judgment of Congress must\nnot be blind, we are also aware that even after Boerne, a great deal\nof deference must still be given to Congress, especially in the face of\na fully developed evidentiary record of discrimination. Such a record\nexists with respect to the ADA. Unlike RFRA, which the Court found\nto be totally unsupported by evidence or examples of present-day reli-\n\n                    10\n\fgious discrimination by States, see Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2169, the\nADA's legislative history is replete with examples of discrimination\nagainst the disabled in the free world.\n\nEven if the legislative record lacked specific findings of discrimi-\nnation with regard to state prison inmates, that would not change our\nfinding that the ADA is remedial and not substantive legislation with\nrespect to state prisons.5 It would be obtuse for us to believe that the\ndiscrimination Congress found to be so pervasive in the free world\nautomatically stops at the prison gates. Furthermore, as the Seventh\nCircuit has noted,\n\n          [disabled prisoners] have the same interest in access to the\n          programs, services and activities available to the other\n          inmates of their prison as disabled people on the outside\n          have to the counterpart programs, services, and activities\n          available to free people. They have no right to more services\n          than the able-bodied inmates, but they have a right, if the\n          Act is given its natural meaning, not to be treated even\n          worse than those more fortunate inmates.\n\nCrawford, 115 F.3d at 486.\n\nIn light of the legislative history and the stated purpose of the\nADA, we must conclude that the ADA, even with respect to state\nprison inmates, is indeed adequately justified as remedial legislation\nand therefore fully within the scope of Congress' enforcement power\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 In any event, Congress did gather evidence on arbitrary discrimina-\ntion against the disabled in prisons. Several House and Senate subcom-\nmittees received into evidence the United States Commission on Civil\nRights Report, Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities\n(1983). See Sen. Rep. No. 101-116 at 6 (1989); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485\n(II) at 28 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 310. This report\npointed to \"[i]nadequate treatment and rehabilitation programs [for the\ndisabled] in penal and juvenile facilities,\" and \"[i]nadequate ability to\ndeal with physically handicapped accused persons and convicts (e.g.,\naccessible jail cells and toilet facilities).\"\n\n                     11\n\fWe cannot, however, stop our inquiry with the mere conclusion\nthat the ADA is remedial in nature. We must also decide whether the\nsweep of the ADA's remedy takes it outside the scope of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. We believe it does not. The scope of the ADA is\nlimited to the unconstitutional conduct that it is aimed at preventing.\nIt does not, as RFRA did, \"[displace] laws and [prohibit] official\nactions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter.\"\nBoerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2170. Even if, however, the application of the\nADA to state prisons may incidentally affect some conduct by prison\nofficials that is otherwise constitutional, such an incidental burden\ndoes not necessarily invalidate the statute. As the Boerne Court stated,\n\"[l]egislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can\nfall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the\nprocess it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and\nintrudes into `legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to\nthe States.'\" Id. at 2169 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzner, 427 U.S. 445,\n455 (1976)). That penal institutions may have to modify some of their\notherwise constitutional practices in order to comply with the ADA\ndoes not make the ADA unconstitutional in light of the discrimination\nit aims to curtail.\n\nWe cannot lose sight of the fact that the ADA limits itself by only\nrequiring that a penal institution make \"reasonable\" accommodations\nfor the disabled that are not unduly burdensome. The ADA, unlike\nRFRA, is not attempting to impose a strict scrutiny standard on all\nstate laws or actions in the absence of evidence of discrimination. The\nSupreme Court objected in large part to RFRA because\"[t]he strin-\ngent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportional-\nity or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end\nto be achieved.\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2171. The ADA dictates no such\nstringent test. Rather, the ADA seeks to impose a scheme that will\nadequately prevent or remedy a well-documented problem of discrim-\nination without unduly burdening the state prison system. It subjects\nsome laws and official actions to a \"reasonable accommodation\"\nrequirement only to the point that the accommodation is not unduly\nburdensome. Such a scheme, unlike RFRA, does not redefine or\nexpand prisoners' constitutional protections, but simply proportion-\nally acts to remedy and prevent documented constitutional wrongs.\n\n                    12\n\fC.\n\nAppellees agree that in design, the ADA passes muster as remedial\nand not substantive legislation, but they argue that the effect of apply-\ning the ADA to state prison inmates will take it out of the scope of\n§ 5 unless this Court follows the lead of the Ninth Circuit and holds\nthat the ADA is only constitutional if it is limited by the holding in\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987).6 See Gates v. Rowland, 39 F.3d\n1439 (9th Cir. 1994).\n\nThis Court has already commented unfavorably on the Ninth Cir-\ncuit's approach in Gates. See Amos I, 126 F.3d at 600. We still\ndecline to use that approach now. For us to graft the standards for\nreview of prisoners' constitutional claims onto these statutes would be\nfor us essentially to rewrite what the Supreme Court has deemed to\nbe unambiguous statutory language. See Yeskey , 118 S.Ct. at 1953-53.\nWe cannot engage in such apractice. See, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Flor-\nida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 75 (1996) (\"Nor are we free to rewrite\nthe statutory scheme in order to approximate what we think Congress\nmight have wanted had it known that [the provision at issue] was\nbeyond its authority. If that effort is to be made, it should be made\nby Congress, and not by the federal courts.\"); Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S.\n305, 323 (1988) (\"The language of [the statute] is unequivocal. . . .\nFaced with this clear directive, . . . we decline petitioner's invitation\nto rewrite the statute.\"); Louisiana Public Service Com'n v. F.C.C.,\n476 U.S. 355, 376 (1986) (\"As we so often admonish, only Congress\ncan rewrite this statute.\"). Our failure to borrow the Turner standard\ndoes not condemn the ADA in the prison context. For the reasons dis-\ncussed above, even as applied to prisons we find that the ADA is a\nvalid exercise of Congress' Fourteenth Amendment enforcement\npower under the Boerne congruence and proportionality test.\n\nAppellees next contend that the Department of Justice Regulations\n(regulations) accompanying the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 Turner addressed the standard of judicial review of state prison\ninmates' constitutional claims of violations of equal protection. The\nCourt held that \"when a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitu-\ntional rights, the regulation is valid if it is`reasonably related' to legiti-\nmate penological interests.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. at 89.\n\n                    13\n\fAct render the statutes too broad-sweeping to survive analysis under\nBoerne, and urge us to reject the regulations as they apply to state\nprisons. (Appellants' S. Br. at 23, n.14).\n\nWith regard to the amount of deference due to regulations promul-\ngated by administrative agencies, the Supreme Court has stated that\nif, in an unambiguous statute, Congress makes \"an express delegation\nof authority to [an] agency to elucidate a specific provision of [a] stat-\nute\" then \"[s]uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight\nunless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the stat-\nute.\" Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837,\n843-44 (1984) (citations omitted).\n\nIn the case of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, statutes\nthe Supreme Court has declared to be unambiguous, Congress has\nmade an express delegation by directing the Department of Justice\n(DOJ) to promulgate implementing regulations for the statutes. See 29\nU.S.C.A. § 794(a) (West 1999); 42 U.S.C.A.§ 12134 (West 1995).\nCongress incorporated § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act's implement-\ning regulations into Title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12201(a)\n(West 1995). As such, this Court must afford a great deal of deference\nto the DOJ's interpretation of these statutes, even if that interpretation\nis somewhat detailed and intrusive into the normal operations of pris-\nons. We cannot reject the regulations wholesale because they are nei-\nther clearly contrary to Congress' \"unambiguous\" intent that these\nstatutes apply to state prisons, nor are they arbitrary or capricious. In\nfact, many of the regulations have a certain degree of flexibility that\nwill allow state prison authorities the latitude to exercise their own\njudgment in devising a scheme that will satisfy both prison authori-\nties' concerns for issues such as safety and Congress' demand for rea-\nsonable accommodation. The regulations provide methods by which\nentities will be sure to come into compliance with the statutes, but\nthey allow for entities such as state prisons to develop their own\nmethods of complying with the statutes.7 This is not to say that all the\n_________________________________________________________________\n7 As United States correctly points out in its supplemental reply brief,\n(Intervenor S. Reply Br. at 14), Regulation 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a) states\nthat construction or alterations made after January 26, 1992, should be\n\"readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\" The\n\n                     14\n\fregulations promulgated under the ADA will be constitutional. The\nconstitutionality of each regulation will require a careful case-by-case\nanalysis of each regulation as challenges to specific regulations arise.8\n\nIn finding that the regulations in general do not extend the reach\nof the ADA too far, we are mindful of the traditional policy of judicial\nrestraint with regard to decisions involving prison administration in\nthe context of constitutional rights, see Procunier v. Martinez, 416\nU.S. 396, 405 (1974), overruled on other grounds by Thornburgh v.\nAbbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. at 84-85, and\nthe deference due to prison authorities with regard to their decisions\non how best to administer their institutions. In counseling deference\nto appropriate prison authorities in the context of prisoners' constitu-\ntional rights, the Supreme Court has recognized that\"[r]unning a\n_________________________________________________________________\nregulation states construction that complies with either of two codes will\ncomply with the ADA. The regulation also dictates, however, that\n\"[d]epartures from particular requirements of either standard by the use\nof other methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equiv-\nalent access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby provided.\" 28\nC.F.R. § 35.151(c).\n8 We feel compelled to note here that since this panel heard this case,\nthe Fourth Circuit has announced its opinion in the case of Brown v.\nNorth Carolina Div. of Motor Vehicles, 166 F.3d 698, 705 (4th Cir.\n1999), reh'g en banc denied. In Brown , the Fourth Circuit struck down\nas unconstitutional a regulation promulgated under the ADA. After care-\nful consideration of the opinion in Brown, we conclude that the decision\nin Brown does not control the issue before us in Amos. The panel in\nBrown considered the validity of a specific regulation promulgated under\nthe ADA, and not the constitutionality of the ADA itself as applied to\nstate agencies. Although the majority in Brown does question Congress'\nauthority with respect to the ADA itself, see Brown, 166 F.3d at 708, the\nmajority does not go so far as to hold that the ADA is unconstitutional.\nTherefore, we continue to adhere to our position that Congress acted\nwithin its § 5 authority when it enacted the ADA with the intent that it\napply to state prisons. We emphasize again, however, that in affirming\nCongress' general exercise of its authority in adopting the ADA with the\nintent that it apply to state prisons, we do not automatically affirm the\nconstitutionality of all regulations promulgated under the ADA by the\nDOJ.\n\n                    15\n\fprison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise,\nplanning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are pecu-\nliarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of\nthe government.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. at 84-85.\n\nWhile in the case of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act we are\nconcerned with the interpretation of statutory and not constitutional\nrights, and while we still decline to graft the standard for constitu-\ntional claims onto the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, we nonetheless\nfeel that in the special context of prison administration, prison offi-\ncials' judgments of what is \"reasonable\" or\"undue\" with regard to\nprisons are due some amount of deference. We find it appropriate to\nnote here our agreement with the Seventh Circuit's statement that\n\n          [t]erms like \"reasonable\" and \"undue\" are relative to circum-\n          stances, and the circumstances of a prison are different from\n          those of a school, an office, or a factory, as the Supreme\n          Court has emphasized in the parallel setting of prisoner'\n          constitutional rights. E.g., Turner v. Safley . . . 482 U.S. at\n          84-91, 107 S.Ct. at 2259-63.\n\nCrawford, 115 F.3d at 487. Thus, while courts deciding the meaning\nof \"reasonable\" and \"undue\" should afford the necessary amount of\ndeference to the DOJ and its regulations, the courts should also con-\nsider the learned opinions of the prison experts charged with running\nthe prisons.\n\nThis permissible deference to prison authorities, however, must be\nbalanced with the great deal of deference due the DOJ in this area,\nsince Congress has spoken through the DOJ with respect to interpreta-\ntion of the ADA. We note, however, that the courts cannot simply\ndefer blindly to either the decisions of the DOJ or to those of prison\nofficials. We emphasize that neither the DOJ nor prison authorities\nthemselves ultimately determine what type of accommodation is \"rea-\nsonable\" or when an accommodation becomes an\"undue burden\" on\na particular institution. Certainly there will be conflicts between the\nviews of the DOJ and prison authorities with respect to what is a \"rea-\nsonable accommodation,\" but it is and always has been the job of the\ncourts to reconcile such conflicting interpretations by considering all\nthe unique surrounding facts and circumstances and attempting to bal-\n\n                     16\n\fance the interests at stake in making the ultimate statutory interpreta-\ntion.\n\nD.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, we hold that Congress acted within\nits constitutionally granted powers when it enacted the ADA and\n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act pursuant to§ 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\nIII.\n\nWe next come to the issue of whether the application of the ADA\nand § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is a valid exercise of Congress'\nauthority under the Commerce Clause. We find it unnecessary to\nreach this issue, however, since we have already found the statutes to\nbe a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.9\n\nIV.\n\nFinally, we reach the issue of sovereign immunity. The State of\nMaryland is entitled under the 11th Amendment of the United States\nConstitution to immunity from suit under the ADA unless Congress\nhas validly abrogated that immunity. The analysis is a two step pro-\ncess, since \"[i]n order to determine whether Congress has abrogated\nthe States' sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether\nCongress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the\nimmunity; . . . and second, whether Congress has acted pursuant to\na valid exercise of power.\" Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517\nU.S. at 55 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\nThe defense of sovereign immunity is not available to Appellees in\nthis case, as Appellees concede in their brief. (Appellees' S. Reply Br.\n_________________________________________________________________\n9 Appellants urge us to rule on the constitutionality of § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act under the Spending Clause. Even if we did find it nec-\nessary to rule on this issue, which we do not, we would be unable to do\nso due to the lack of evidence in the record on the status of federal fund-\ning made available to and accepted by RCI.\n\n                     17\n\fat 37). Since neither party disputes that Congress, through 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12202, unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the States'\nsovereign immunity under the ADA, and since we have held today\nthat the ADA is a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Four-\nteenth Amendment, we rule that the State of Maryland's sovereign\nimmunity has been validly abrogated and the State is subject to suit\nin this case. Since the District Court granted summary judgment in\nthis case based on the incorrect conclusion that the ADA and Rehabil-\nitation Act do not apply to state prisons, we do not have an adequately\ndeveloped record of the facts surrounding the Appellants' statutory\nclaims to make a determination about whether Appellees violated\nAppellants' statutory rights. We must, therefore, remand to the Dis-\ntrict Court for determination of the Appellants' statutory claims on\ntheir merits.\n\nV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find that application of the ADA and\nthe Rehabilitation Act to state prisons is a valid exercise of Congress'\nlegislative powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and that\nthe Appellees are validly subject to suit under these statutes.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\nMURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\nI join Judge Clarke's judgment and opinion. I write separately only\nto recall the powerful sentiments of Justice Marshall and the grave\nnature of the discrimination at issue in this case. In his separate opin-\nion in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432\n(1985), Justice Marshall argued that the courts should pay special def-\nerence to evolving standards of equality as embodied in acts of Con-\ngress:\n\n          history makes clear that constitutional principles of equality,\n          like constitutional principles of liberty, property, and due\n          process, evolve over time; what once was a \"natural\" and\n          \"self-evident\" ordering later comes to be seen as an artificial\n          and invidious constraint on human potential and freedom.\n\n                     18\n\f          Shifting cultural, political, and social patterns at times come\n          to make past practices appear inconsistent with fundamental\n          principles upon which American society rests, an inconsis-\n          tency legally cognizable under the Equal Protection Clause.\n          It is natural that evolving standards of equality come to be\n          embodied in legislation. When that occurs, courts should\n          look to the fact of such change as a source of guidance on\n          evolving principles of equality.\n\nId. at 466 (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part) (citations omitted). This deference is especially appro-\npriate in the often fact-based equal protection context1 and given the\ncommand in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157\n(1997), that we give wide latitude to Congressional judgments as to\nwhat legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, id. at 2163 & 2171.\n\nIn enacting the ADA, Congress gathered extensive evidence recog-\nnizing that the disabled had long been subjected to invidious discrimi-\nnation, and had not enjoyed the equal protection under the law\nguaranteed by the Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. On sev-\neral occasions in its argument the Appellees pointed out that the ADA\noften mandates changes based on differences of only a few inches --\ne.g., in the width of a door frame or in the height of a toilet seat. By\nthis argument the Appellees unwittingly revealed the accuracy of\nCongress' determination that unconstitutional invidious discrimina-\ntion against the disabled abounds. Appellees are correct; often the dif-\nference between accommodating the disabled and leaving them\nsegregated and excluded is only a difference of a few inches. But, for\nthe disabled, \"almost\" is not good enough. From the perspective of a\ndisabled American, the absence of these accommodations in a build-\ning, a hallway, a bathroom, or a state-run program is tantamount to\na sign that says, \"No disabled allowed.\" A state's failure to consider\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Cf. Clark v. State of California , 123 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(concluding that the Supreme Court's level of scrutiny for purposes of\nEqual Protection review does not define the boundaries of Congress' § 5\nenforcement powers); Kimel v. State of Fla.

The state effectively tells the dis-\nabled, \"As far as we are concerned you do not exist.\" Like so many\nin the rest of society, the state simply averts its eyes when confronted\nwith a member of the disabled, and tries to ignore the person as the\nstate goes about its business.\n\nBut this deliberate ignorance is unreasonable and irrational. The\ndisabled are as much a part of society as are those of us fortunate\nenough not to be challenged. The need to have a ramp for a building\nand accessible toilets and showers is as evident as the need to have\ndoors and bathrooms in the first place.2 A state's decision to construct\nfacilities and design programs as if the disabled are not a part of soci-\nety stems from attitudes formed during a \"`lengthy and tragic history'\nof segregation and discrimination,\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 461\n(Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in\npart) (quoting Univ. of Cal. Regents v. Bakke , 438 U.S. 265, 303\n(1978)), which continues to affect the daily lives of the disabled. Such\nconsiderations should not be overlooked.\n\nWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nBy enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the\nRehabilitation Act, Congress has, in my opinion, attempted to expand\nthe scope of substantive constitutional rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment by subjecting state action that incidentally burdens the\ndisabled to a higher level of judicial scrutiny than what the Supreme\nCourt held to be required by the Constitution in City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Ctr. Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985) (holding that\nstate action affecting the disabled is constitutional if \"rationally\nrelated to a legitimate government purpose\"). In light of the Supreme\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 For instance, we would have no problem finding that the absence of\nbathrooms or programs accessible to women in a state facility open to\nwomen constitutes irrational discrimination. We would come to this con-\nclusion not because distinctions based on gender are subject to height-\nened equal protection scrutiny, but because it is simply unreasonable to\nignore the needs of this group, whether by \"oversight\" or design, when\nsuch needs can be reasonably accommodated.\n\n                     20\n\fCourt's landmark decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct.\n2157, 2164 (1997) (reaffirming that Congress cannot expand the sub-\nstantive scope of the Fourteenth Amendment), and this Court's recent\ndecision in Brown v. North Carolina Div. of Motor Vehicles, 166 F.3d\n698, 705 (4th Cir. 1999) (striking down a regulation promulgated\nunder the ADA in light of Boerne and Cleburne), I am constrained to\nconclude that Congress exceeded its power under Section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment in enacting the ADA and the Rehabilitation\nAct. Because Congress has failed validly to abrogate the State of\nMaryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity, and the State of Mary-\nland has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by accepting\nfederal funds, I respectfully dissent.1\n\nI.\n\nIt is well established that immunity under the Eleventh Amendment\naffects our subject matter jurisdiction. See Brown v. North Carolina\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 In enacting the ADA, Congress announced its intent \"to invoke the\nsweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the\n[F]ourteenth [A]mendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address\nthe major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with dis-\nabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(b)(4) (West 1995). Because of the pos-\nture of this case, however, I need not address whether Congress has the\nauthority to apply the ADA to state prisons under the Commerce Clause.\nIn their suit, Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. It\nis undisputed, however, that Plaintiffs sued Defendants in their official\ncapacities only. As a result, only the State of Maryland is potentially lia-\nble for monetary damages. As noted above, Congress cannot abrogate the\nState of Maryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity when enacting leg-\nislation pursuant to the Commerce Clause. See Seminole Tribe of Florida\nv. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 59-73 (1996). In addition, none of the Plaintiffs,\nmost of whom are no longer incarcerated by the State of Maryland, are\ncurrently housed at the Roxbury Correctional Institution (RCI) in\nHagerstown, Maryland, the institution to which all of Plaintiffs' claims\nwere directed. As a result, Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are\nmoot. See Williams v. Griffin, 952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir. 1991) (holding\nthat prisoner's transfer to another facility mooted his claims for injunc-\ntive relief); Taylor v. Rogers, 781 F.2d 1047, 1048 n.1 (4th Cir. 1986)\n(holding that prisoner's transfer mooted a request for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief).\n\n                    21\n\fDiv. of Motor Vehicles, 166 F.3d 698, 701 (4th Cir. 1999). Thus,\nwhen raised by a State, as it was here by the State of Maryland, this\nCourt must first address whether Eleventh Amendment immunity is\napplicable.2 See Wisconsin Dep't of Corrections v. Schacht, 118 S. Ct.\n2047, 2052 (1998) (holding that a court can ignore Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity only if a state fails to raise the question). For the rea-\nsons that follow, I conclude that this suit should have been dismissed\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\nBetter Environment, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 1012 (1998) (\"Jurisdiction is\npower to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only func-\ntion remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismiss-\ning the cause.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment provides as follows:\n\n          The Judicial power of the United States shall not be con-\n          strued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or\n          prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of\n          another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\n          State.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XI. The Eleventh Amendment not only prohibits\nsuits brought against States in federal court by citizens of other States,\nbut also prohibits suits, such as the one here, brought against a State\nin federal court by its own citizens. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S.\n1, 15-16 (1890). Thus, whether this Court has subject matter jurisdic-\ntion depends on whether the State of Maryland's Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity has been either abrogated or waived.\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 The majority erroneously states that the State of Maryland has con-\nceded that \"[t]he defense of sovereign immunity is not available.\" Ante\nat 17 (citing Appellees' S. Br. at 37). Although the State of Maryland has\nconceded that \"[t]he defense of qualified immunity is not available,\"\n(Appellees' S. Br. at 37), the State of Maryland specifically argues that\nif \"neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act can constitutionally be\nextended to state prisons as an exercise of Congress' enforcement power\nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, . . . then the Inmates' claims\nin federal court are barred in their entirety by the Eleventh Amendment,\"\n(Appellees' S. Br. at 37).\n\n                    22\n\fA.\n\nIn Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), the Supreme\nCourt recently considered the issue of when Congress can properly\nabrogate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. In Seminole, the\nSupreme Court specifically held that Congress had no authority to\nabrogate a State's sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amend-\nment when it enacted legislation pursuant to the Commerce Clause.\nSee id. at 59-73. In contrast, Congress may abrogate a State's sover-\neign immunity when it enacts valid legislation pursuant to Section 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.3See Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S.\n445, 456 (1976) (\"[T]he Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of\nstate sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the\nenforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" (cita-\ntion omitted)). Thus, whether Congress had the authority to abrogate\nthe State of Maryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity turns on\nwhether Congress had the authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to enact the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. See\nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238 (1985) (holding\nthat the courts must ensure that Congress was \"acting pursuant to § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\").\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n           Section 1. . . . . No State shall make or enforce any law\n           which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens\n           of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 In addition, Congress must express its intent to abrogate the States'\nEleventh Amendment immunity by providing \"a clear legislative state-\nment,\" i.e., by \"making its intention unmistakably clear in the language\nof the statute.\" Seminole Tribe v. Florida , 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996) (citing\nBlatchford v. Native Village of Noatak & Circle Village, 501 U.S. 775,\n785 (1991), and Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 224-25 (1989)). Both\nparties agree that the ADA, see 42 U.S.C.A. § 12202 (West 1995) (\"A\nState shall not be immune under the [E]leventh[A]mendment . . . .\"), and\nthe Rehabilitation Act, see 42 U.S.C.A.§ 2000d-7(a)(1) (West 1994) (\"A\nState shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment . . . .\"),\ninclude clear statements of Congress's intent to abrogate the States'\nEleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n                   23\n\f          of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor\n          deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protec-\n          tion of the laws.\n\n          ....\n\n          Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by\n          appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, §§ 1, 5. Section 5\"is a positive grant of leg-\nislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in deter-\nmining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the\nguarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Katzenbach v. Morgan,\n384 U.S. 641, 651 (1966). In fact, \"when properly exercising its\npower under § 5, Congress is not limited by the same Tenth Amend-\nment constraints that circumscribe the exercise of its Commerce\nClause powers.\" EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 243 n.18 (1983)\n(emphasis added) (citing City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156,\n179 (1980)). Congress's power to enact legislation under the Four-\nteenth Amendment is not unlimited, however. See, e.g., City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 2171-72 (1997) (holding that the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act is \"a considerable congressional\nintrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives,\" and that Congress\nexceeded its power under the Fourteenth Amendment in enacting the\nstatute); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 469 (1991) (stating that\n\"the Fourteenth Amendment does not override all principles of feder-\nalism\"); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 128 (1970) (noting that\n\"[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlim-\nited\"). For instance, Congress's power \"extends only to enforcing the\nprovisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2164\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\nOf perhaps equal importance, Congress does not possess \"the power\nto determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.\" Id. \"In other\nwords, Congress has the power to remedy violations of constitutional\nrights, not [the power] to define the substance of those rights.\" Brown,\n166 F.3d at 705.\n\nThe standard for determining whether an exercise of Congress's\nSection 5 power is appropriate was set forth in Boerne: The injury to\nbe prevented or remedied must be a \"constitutional violation[ ],\"\n\n                    24\n\fBoerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2163, and the means employed must be congru-\nent and proportional to any such violation, see id. at 2164. Although\nCongress has the power to remedy violations of constitutional rights,\nit bears repeating that the Supreme Court in Boerne specifically\nrejected the notion that Congress can expand or define the substantive\nscope of constitutional rights using its Section 5 powers:\n\n          Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing\n          what the right is. It has been given the power \"to enforce,\"\n          not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional\n          violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing\n          would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the\"provi-\n          sions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].\"\n\nBoerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2164 (alteration in original).\n\nIn Boerne, the Supreme Court decided that, in enacting the Reli-\ngious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Congress had impermissibly\nattempted to expand the scope of substantive constitutional rights\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment by subjecting generally applicable\nstate laws that had the effect of burdening religion to a higher level\nof judicial scrutiny than that required by the Supreme Court in\nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 887-88 (1990). In sum,\nthe Supreme Court held that Congress could not create a substantive\nconstitutional right to \"strict scrutiny\" for state action to which the\nSupreme Court had already determined that a lower standard of\nreview should apply. See Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2170. In so holding,\nthe Supreme Court made the following observation about RFRA:\n\n          The stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a\n          lack of proportionality or congruence between the means\n          adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector\n          can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the State\n          must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and\n          show that the law is the least restrictive means of furthering\n          its interest. . . . Laws valid under Smith would fall under\n          RFRA without regard to whether they had the object of sti-\n          fling or punishing free exercise. We make these observa-\n          tions . . . to illustrate the substantive alteration of [Smith's]\n          holding attempted by RFRA. Even assuming RFRA would\n\n                     25\n\f          be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test, say one\n          equivalent to intermediate scrutiny, the statute nevertheless\n          would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with\n          the attendant likelihood of invalidation. This is a consider-\n          able congressional intrusion into the States' traditional pre-\n          rogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and\n          welfare of their citizens.\n\nId. at 2171.\n\nIn City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432\n(1985), the Supreme Court expressly rejected an attempt to make the\nmentally disabled a suspect, or quasi-suspect, class for Equal Protec-\ntion purposes:\n\n          [W]e conclude for several reasons that the Court of Appeals\n          erred in holding mental retardation a quasi-suspect classifi-\n          cation calling for a more exacting standard of judicial\n          review than is normally accorded economic and social legis-\n          lation.\n\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 442. The Supreme Court determined that state\naction placing incidental burdens on the mentally disabled would be\nsubject to rational basis scrutiny. See id. at 446 (holding that state\naction affecting the mentally disabled is constitutional if \"rationally\nrelated to a legitimate governmental purpose\"); see also Doe v. Uni-\nversity of Md. Medical Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1267 (4th Cir. 1995)\n(extending rational basis scrutiny to all disabilities). As the First Cir-\ncuit recently noted:\n\n          Congress' section five enforcement power, as it pertains to\n          the Equal Protection Clause in cases not involving suspect\n          or quasi-suspect classes or fundamental interests, is limited\n          to the elimination of arbitrariness or the effects of arbitrary\n          government action, and does not permit Congress to prohibit\n          or otherwise target reasonable state decisions or practices.\n\nMills v. Maine, 118 F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Brown, 166\nF.3d at 706-07 (noting that arbitrary and irrational discrimination vio-\nlates the Equal Protection Clause under rational basis scrutiny).\n\n                     26\n\fA careful review of the Supreme Court's decisions in Boerne and\nCleburne, reveals an amazing similarity between the ADA and\nRFRA. As Judge Smith recently noted:\n\n          Both RFRA and the ADA purport to establish greater rights\n          for individuals against the states by increasing the measure\n          of judicial scrutiny for conflicting state actions to a level\n          higher than the Supreme Court has found appropriate under\n          the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . [T]he ADA increases the\n          judicial scrutiny level applicable for disabled persons by\n          requiring a closer nexus between the governmental purpose\n          and the governmental means than presently exists under\n          rational basis scrutiny. The ADA mandates an affirmative\n          justification for a state action that has the effect of inciden-\n          tally burdening these non-suspect classes of persons; a\n          state's actions are no longer presumptively valid if rationally\n          related to the interests that they serve. Instead, the state must\n          make \"reasonable accommodations\" for the disabled -- and\n          only once the state can show that it cannot \"reasonably\n          accommodate\" will the courts validate the state's chosen\n          policy.\n\nCoolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430, 440-41 (5th Cir. 1998)\n(Smith, J., dissenting) (internal citation omitted). A panel of this\nCourt recently came to the same conclusion, i.e. , the ADA, like\nRFRA, impermissibly attempts to subject state action to higher level\nof judicial scrutiny than the Supreme Court has found appropriate\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brown, 166 F.3d at 708.\n\nAlthough the panel in Brown considered the validity of a regulation\npromulgated under the ADA, rather than the ADA itself, I believe that\nthe panel's reasoning controls the issue before us today. In holding\nthat the regulation at issue did not lie within the scope of Congress's\nenforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment, the panel in\nBrown specifically held that the level of judicial scrutiny required by\nthe ADA was incompatible with the more lenient rational basis test\nestablished in Cleburne. See id. In fact, as this Court noted, the ADA\nwas simply not intended to remedy violations of the standard estab-\nlished in Cleburne. See id. Rather, the ADA was intended to effect a\n\"`substantive alteration of [Cleburne's] holding.'\" Id. (quoting\n\n                    27\n\fBoerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2171). As a result, State actions that are ratio-\nnally based and perfectly constitutional under Cleburne are invalid\nunder the ADA. In that crucial respect, the ADA is nearly indistin-\nguishable from RFRA, i.e., the ADA is definitional rather than reme-\ndial. Indeed, as Judge Smith observed, by changing but a few words\nin Boerne, the Supreme Court could well have been speaking about\nthe ADA:\n\n          The stringent test [the ADA] demands of state laws\n          reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the\n          means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an\n          objector can show a substantial burden [of his rights under\n          the ADA], the State must [show that it cannot reasonably\n          accommodate him]. . . . Laws valid under [Cleburne] would\n          fall under [the ADA] without regard to whether they [were\n          rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose]. We\n          make these observations . . . to illustrate the substantive\n          alteration of [Cleburne's] holding attempted by [the ADA].\n          Even assuming [the ADA] would be interpreted in effect to\n          mandate some lesser test, say one equivalent to intermediate\n          scrutiny, the statute nevertheless would require searching\n          judicial scrutiny of state law with the attendant likelihood of\n          invalidation. This is a considerable congressional intrusion\n          into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority\n          to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.\n\nBoerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2171.\n\nPrior to this Court's decision in Brown, five Circuits published\nopinions upholding the ADA as a valid exercise of Congress's Sec-\ntion 5 powers. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 139 F.3d 1426,\n1433 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. granted, 119 S. Ct. 901 (1999); Autio v.\nAFSCME, Local 3139, 140 F.3d 802, 806 (8th Cir. 1998), vacated,\n140 F.3d 802, reh'g en banc, 157 F.3d 1141 (affirming district court's\ndecision upholding the ADA by an evenly divided vote); Coolbaugh\nv. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430, 432 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 58\n(1998); Clark v. California, 123 F.3d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir. 1997), cert.\ndenied, 118 S. Ct. 2340 (1998); and Crawford v. Indiana Dep't of\nCorrections, 115 F.3d 481, 487 (7th Cir. 1997). Despite that fact, it\nis worth noting that a number of appellate and district court judges\n\n                    28\n\fhave come to the opposite conclusion. See Autio , 157 F.3d at 1141\n(Bowman, C.J., & Wollman, Beam, Loken, Hansen, & Morris Shep-\npard Arnold, JJ.) (concluding that Congress exceeded its power under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in enacting the ADA); Kimel,\n139 F.3d at 1444 (Cox, J., dissenting) (noting that the disabled enjoy\nno special rights under the Equal Protection Clause); Coolbaugh, 136\nF.3d at 439 (Smith, J., dissenting) (noting that in the wake of Boerne,\nCongress could not, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment,\nincrease the level of scrutiny for states' actions that incidently burden\ndisabled persons); Kilcullen v. New York State Dep't of Trans., 33 F.\nSupp.2d 133 (N.D.N.Y. 1999) (same); Hedgepeth v. Tennessee, 33 F.\nSupp.2d 668, 675 (W.D. Tenn. 1998) (same); Garrett v. Board of\nTrustees of University of Ala. in Birmingham, 989 F. Supp. 1409\n(N.D. Ala. 1998) (same); Brown v. North Carolina Div. of Motor\nVehicles, 987 F. Supp. 451 (E.D.N.C. 1997) (same); Nihiser v. Ohio\nE.P.A., 979 F. Supp. 1168, 1170-76 (S.D. Ohio 1997) (same). Like\nthe aforementioned judges, I conclude -- and would so conclude even\nwithout this Court's recent decision in Brown , which I believe to be\ncontrolling here -- that Congress exceeded its power under Section\n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting the ADA.\n\nCongress does not possess the power under Section 5 of the Four-\nteenth Amendment to supersede a Supreme Court decision construing\nthe substantive rights embodied by the Constitution. See United States\nv. Dickerson, 166 F.3d 667, 687 (4th Cir. 1999). In Cleburne, the\nSupreme Court held that the disabled are not a class entitled to\nincreased Fourteenth Amendment protection. In light of the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Cleburne, Congress does not have the power to\ndeclare otherwise in the ADA. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1\nCranch) 137 (1803). Following this Court's decision in Brown, which\nfaithfully applied the dictates of Boerne and Cleburne, I am con-\nstrained to conclude that Congress exceeded its authority under Sec-\ntion 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in attempting to abrogate\nMaryland's sovereign immunity with the ADA.\n\nB.\n\nIn Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985), the\nSupreme Court considered whether a State waives its Eleventh\nAmendment immunity by accepting federal funds under a federal pro-\n\n                    29\n\fgram enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause. In Atascadero, the\nSupreme Court specifically held that \"the mere receipt of federal\nfunds cannot establish that a State has consented to suit in federal\ncourt.\" Id. at 246-47. Rather, the statute in question must expressly\n\"condition participation in the program funded under the Act on a\nState's consent to waive its constitutional immunity.\" Id. at 247.\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's decision in Atascadero, Con-\ngress amended the Rehabilitation Act as follows:\n\n          (1) A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh\n          Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from\n          suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the\n          Rehabilitation Act of 1973 . . . or the provisions of any other\n          Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of\n          Federal financial assistance.\n\n          (2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a statute\n          referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including remedies\n          both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation\n          to the same extent as such remedies are available for such\n          a violation in the suit against any public or private entity\n          other than a State.\n\n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-7(a) (West 1994). Without question, Congress,\nby enacting § 2000d-7(a), has expressed its intent to abrogate the\nStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Franklin v. Gwinnett\nCounty Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 72 (1992) (noting that Congress, by\nenacting § 2000d-7, expressed its intent to\"abrogate\" the States'\nEleventh Amendment immunity under the Rehabilitation Act). I ques-\ntion, however, whether the language of § 2000d-7 sufficiently \"condi-\ntions\" a State's receipt of federal funds under the Rehabilitation Act\non that State's \"consent\" to waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nAs the Supreme Court recently noted, the doctrines of abrogation\nand waiver are \"completely unrelated.\" Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at\n63. With respect to the Eleventh Amendment, abrogation deals with\nCongress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nsubject unconsenting States to federal court jurisdiction. See\nAtascadero, 473 U.S. at 242-46. In contrast, waiver deals with, among\n\n                    30\n\fother things, Congress's power under the Spending Clause to condi-\ntion the receipt of federal funds on a State's consent to federal juris-\ndiction. See id. at 246-47. Thus, while statutory language may be\nsufficient to satisfy the demands of abrogation, it may nonetheless fail\nto satisfy the demands of waiver. Here, the language in question sim-\nply placed the State of Maryland on notice that it could be sued in\nfederal court if the Rehabilitation Act was a valid exercise of Con-\ngress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed,\nthe statute did not use the type of words or phrases, e.g. \"if,\" \"pro-\nvided that,\" \"when,\" \"after,\" \"as soon as,\" and \"subject to,\" that would\nindicate that the receipt of funds had been made conditional. Because\n§ 2000d-7(a) did not, as the Supreme Court requires, \"expressly con-\ndition\" the State of Maryland's receipt of federal funds under the\nRehabilitation Act on its consent to waive its constitutional immunity,\nthere is no indication that the State of Maryland knowingly and vol-\nuntarily waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nII.\n\nBecause the State of Maryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity\nwas neither abrogated nor waived, this case should have been dis-\nmissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\n                    31\n\f",

The Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's opinion that\nthe ADA does apply to state prisons, stating explicitly that Congress\ndrafted the ADA in unambiguous terms. Based on the unambiguous\ntext of the statute, the Court held that Congress clearly intended to\ninclude state prisons within the scope of the ADA. See Yeskey, 118\nS.Ct. at 1953-54. Although the Court ruled that Congress intended for\nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act to apply to state prisons, the Court\nexpressly declined to rule on the issue of whether application of the\nADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congress' legisla-\ntive power, either under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or the\nCommerce Clause. Id. at 1956.\n\nBy Order of July 10, 1998, after this Court regained jurisdiction\nover Amos I on remand, we directed both parties to file supplemental\nbriefs addressing the issue of the constitutionality of the application\nof the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to state prisons. Both Appellants\nand Appellees, as well as the United States as intervenor and several\namicus curiae, filed briefs addressing the issue. 2 Being bound to reject\n_________________________________________________________________\nConstitution. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\nAppellees on that claim, as well, and we affirmed. See Amos I, 126 F.3d\nat 611. Since Appellants did not petition the Supreme Court for certiorari\non this Court's ruling on the Eighth Amendment claims, these claims are\nno longer before the Court and will not be addressed further.\n2 Although the issue of the constitutionality of applying the ADA and\nRehabilitation Act to state prisons was not raised below, we exercise our\nlimited discretion to consider the issue on appeal in light of the fact that\nthe constitutionality of this federal statute is purely a question of law,\nboth parties have fully briefed the issue, and its resolution at this stage\nwill advance and expedite the progress of this litigation.

In Smith, the Court had\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not\nrequire States to justify by a compelling interest generally applicable,\nneutral laws that coincidentally burden religious practices. See Smith,\n494 U.S. at 884-86. Thus, Smith essentially lowered the standard for\njudicial review of generally applicable, neutral laws that burden reli-\ngion. In direct response to Smith, and in an attempt to remedy sup-\nposed harms to the free exercise of religion, Congress passed RFRA,\nwhich required all laws that burden a group's religion, even neutral\nlaws of general applicability, to be narrowly tailored and justified by\na compelling interest. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n\nIn striking down RFRA, the Supreme Court admonished that § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress only the power to\nenforce the Fourteenth Amendment and not the power to define the\nsubstance of the Amendment since \"[t]he design of the Amendment\nand the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress\nhas the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's\nrestrictions on the States.\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2164. Thus, Congress'\npower is remedial and not substantive in nature. The Boerne Court\nhad the foresight to recognize that distinguishing between laws that\nremedy or prevent unconstitutional conduct and laws that operate to\ndefine constitutional rights substantively is a difficult task, and in an\neffort to guide lower courts in analyzing laws passed under § 5, the\nCourt crafted its \"congruence and proportionality\" test for deciding\nwhether Congress has acted outside the scope of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In order for laws to qualify as remedial under the Four-\nteenth Amendment, according to Boerne, \"[t]here must be a congru-\nence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or\nremedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Id. (internal quotation\nand citation omitted). Thus, as the Tenth Circuit has aptly interpreted\nBoerne, \"[i]f the legislation at issue imposes burdens far greater than\nthe seriousness of any demonstrated constitutional injury requiring\nsuch measures, then the legislation does not remediate the constitu-\ntional violation but creates substantive change in constitutional pro-\ntections.\" Migneault v. Peck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157044\"><a href=\"/opinion/157044/migneault-v-peck/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1137 (10th Cir. 1998)\n(citing Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2163-70).\n\n                     8\n\fThe Court applied its congruence and proportionality test to RFRA\nand found that the broad sweeping and constitutionally demanding\ntests set up by RFRA totally lacked the necessary congruence and\nproportionality to the harm the statute purported to remedy. Finding\nno evidence in the record of \"modern instances of generally applica-\nble laws passed because of religious bigotry,\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at\n2169, the Court found the statute to be \"so out of proportion to a sup-\nposed remedial or preventative object that it cannot be understood as\nresponsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\" Id.\nat 2170. Thus, by creating substantive and not remedial legislation,\nCongress exceeded its remedial legislative powers under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\nSince Congress purported to exercise its Fourteenth Amendment\nenforcement powers when enacting the ADA, see 42 U.S.C.A.\n§ 12101(a)(7), (b)(4) (West 1995), we analyze the question of its con-\nstitutionality under Boerne's test for congruence and proportionality.\nHaving examined, among other things, the statute itself, portions of\nits legislative history, see 42 U.S.C. § 12101; S.

Thus, while\nwe are mindful that our deference to the judgment of Congress must\nnot be blind, we are also aware that even after Boerne, a great deal\nof deference must still be given to Congress, especially in the face of\na fully developed evidentiary record of discrimination. Such a record\nexists with respect to the ADA. Unlike RFRA, which the Court found\nto be totally unsupported by evidence or examples of present-day reli-\n\n                    10\n\fgious discrimination by States, see Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2169, the\nADA's legislative history is replete with examples of discrimination\nagainst the disabled in the free world.\n\nEven if the legislative record lacked specific findings of discrimi-\nnation with regard to state prison inmates, that would not change our\nfinding that the ADA is remedial and not substantive legislation with\nrespect to state prisons.5 It would be obtuse for us to believe that the\ndiscrimination Congress found to be so pervasive in the free world\nautomatically stops at the prison gates. Furthermore, as the Seventh\nCircuit has noted,\n\n          [disabled prisoners] have the same interest in access to the\n          programs, services and activities available to the other\n          inmates of their prison as disabled people on the outside\n          have to the counterpart programs, services, and activities\n          available to free people. They have no right to more services\n          than the able-bodied inmates, but they have a right, if the\n          Act is given its natural meaning, not to be treated even\n          worse than those more fortunate inmates.\n\nCrawford, 115 F.3d at 486.\n\nIn light of the legislative history and the stated purpose of the\nADA, we must conclude that the ADA, even with respect to state\nprison inmates, is indeed adequately justified as remedial legislation\nand therefore fully within the scope of Congress' enforcement power\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 In any event, Congress did gather evidence on arbitrary discrimina-\ntion against the disabled in prisons. Several House and Senate subcom-\nmittees received into evidence the United States Commission on Civil\nRights Report, Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities\n(1983). See Sen. Rep. No. 101-116 at 6 (1989); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485\n(II) at 28 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 310. This report\npointed to \"[i]nadequate treatment and rehabilitation programs [for the\ndisabled] in penal and juvenile facilities,\" and \"[i]nadequate ability to\ndeal with physically handicapped accused persons and convicts (e.g.,\naccessible jail cells and toilet facilities).\"\n\n                     11\n\fWe cannot, however, stop our inquiry with the mere conclusion\nthat the ADA is remedial in nature. We must also decide whether the\nsweep of the ADA's remedy takes it outside the scope of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. We believe it does not. The scope of the ADA is\nlimited to the unconstitutional conduct that it is aimed at preventing.\nIt does not, as RFRA did, \"[displace] laws and [prohibit] official\nactions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter.\"\nBoerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2170. Even if, however, the application of the\nADA to state prisons may incidentally affect some conduct by prison\nofficials that is otherwise constitutional, such an incidental burden\ndoes not necessarily invalidate the statute. As the Boerne Court stated,\n\"[l]egislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can\nfall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the\nprocess it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and\nintrudes into `legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to\nthe States.'\" Id. at 2169 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109520\"><a href=\"/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n455 (1976)). That penal institutions may have to modify some of their\notherwise constitutional practices in order to comply with the ADA\ndoes not make the ADA unconstitutional in light of the discrimination\nit aims to curtail.\n\nWe cannot lose sight of the fact that the ADA limits itself by only\nrequiring that a penal institution make \"reasonable\" accommodations\nfor the disabled that are not unduly burdensome. The ADA, unlike\nRFRA, is not attempting to impose a strict scrutiny standard on all\nstate laws or actions in the absence of evidence of discrimination. The\nSupreme Court objected in large part to RFRA because\"[t]he strin-\ngent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportional-\nity or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end\nto be achieved.\" Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2171. The ADA dictates no such\nstringent test. Rather, the ADA seeks to impose a scheme that will\nadequately prevent or remedy a well-documented problem of discrim-\nination without unduly burdening the state prison system. It subjects\nsome laws and official actions to a \"reasonable accommodation\"\nrequirement only to the point that the accommodation is not unduly\nburdensome. Such a scheme, unlike RFRA, does not redefine or\nexpand prisoners' constitutional protections, but simply proportion-\nally acts to remedy and prevent documented constitutional wrongs.\n\n                    12\n\fC.\n\nAppellees agree that in design, the ADA passes muster as remedial\nand not substantive legislation, but they argue that the effect of apply-\ning the ADA to state prison inmates will take it out of the scope of\n§ 5 unless this Court follows the lead of the Ninth Circuit and holds\nthat the ADA is only constitutional if it is limited by the holding in\nTurner v.

See 29\nU.S.C.A. § 794(a) (West 1999); 42 U.S.C.A.§ 12134 (West 1995).\nCongress incorporated § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act's implement-\ning regulations into Title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12201(a)\n(West 1995). As such, this Court must afford a great deal of deference\nto the DOJ's interpretation of these statutes, even if that interpretation\nis somewhat detailed and intrusive into the normal operations of pris-\nons. We cannot reject the regulations wholesale because they are nei-\nther clearly contrary to Congress' \"unambiguous\" intent that these\nstatutes apply to state prisons, nor are they arbitrary or capricious. In\nfact, many of the regulations have a certain degree of flexibility that\nwill allow state prison authorities the latitude to exercise their own\njudgment in devising a scheme that will satisfy both prison authori-\nties' concerns for issues such as safety and Congress' demand for rea-\nsonable accommodation. The regulations provide methods by which\nentities will be sure to come into compliance with the statutes, but\nthey allow for entities such as state prisons to develop their own\nmethods of complying with the statutes.7 This is not to say that all the\n_________________________________________________________________\n7 As United States correctly points out in its supplemental reply brief,\n(Intervenor S.

The\nconstitutionality of each regulation will require a careful case-by-case\nanalysis of each regulation as challenges to specific regulations arise.8\n\nIn finding that the regulations in general do not extend the reach\nof the ADA too far, we are mindful of the traditional policy of judicial\nrestraint with regard to decisions involving prison administration in\nthe context of constitutional rights, see Procunier v.

In Brown , the Fourth Circuit struck down\nas unconstitutional a regulation promulgated under the ADA. After care-\nful consideration of the opinion in Brown, we conclude that the decision\nin Brown does not control the issue before us in Amos. The panel in\nBrown considered the validity of a specific regulation promulgated under\nthe ADA, and not the constitutionality of the ADA itself as applied to\nstate agencies. Although the majority in Brown does question Congress'\nauthority with respect to the ADA itself, see Brown, 166 F.3d at 708, the\nmajority does not go so far as to hold that the ADA is unconstitutional.\nTherefore, we continue to adhere to our position that Congress acted\nwithin its § 5 authority when it enacted the ADA with the intent that it\napply to state prisons. We emphasize again, however, that in affirming\nCongress' general exercise of its authority in adopting the ADA with the\nintent that it apply to state prisons, we do not automatically affirm the\nconstitutionality of all regulations promulgated under the ADA by the\nDOJ.\n\n                    15\n\fprison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise,\nplanning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are pecu-\nliarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of\nthe government.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. at 84-85.\n\nWhile in the case of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act we are\nconcerned with the interpretation of statutory and not constitutional\nrights, and while we still decline to graft the standard for constitu-\ntional claims onto the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, we nonetheless\nfeel that in the special context of prison administration, prison offi-\ncials' judgments of what is \"reasonable\" or\"undue\" with regard to\nprisons are due some amount of deference. We find it appropriate to\nnote here our agreement with the Seventh Circuit's statement that\n\n          [t]erms like \"reasonable\" and \"undue\" are relative to circum-\n          stances, and the circumstances of a prison are different from\n          those of a school, an office, or a factory, as the Supreme\n          Court has emphasized in the parallel setting of prisoner'\n          constitutional rights. E.g., Turner v. Safley . . . 482 U.S. at\n          84-91, 107 S.Ct. at 2259-63.\n\nCrawford, 115 F.3d at 487. Thus, while courts deciding the meaning\nof \"reasonable\" and \"undue\" should afford the necessary amount of\ndeference to the DOJ and its regulations, the courts should also con-\nsider the learned opinions of the prison experts charged with running\nthe prisons.\n\nThis permissible deference to prison authorities, however, must be\nbalanced with the great deal of deference due the DOJ in this area,\nsince Congress has spoken through the DOJ with respect to interpreta-\ntion of the ADA. We note, however, that the courts cannot simply\ndefer blindly to either the decisions of the DOJ or to those of prison\nofficials. We emphasize that neither the DOJ nor prison authorities\nthemselves ultimately determine what type of accommodation is \"rea-\nsonable\" or when an accommodation becomes an\"undue burden\" on\na particular institution. Certainly there will be conflicts between the\nviews of the DOJ and prison authorities with respect to what is a \"rea-\nsonable accommodation,\" but it is and always has been the job of the\ncourts to reconcile such conflicting interpretations by considering all\nthe unique surrounding facts and circumstances and attempting to bal-\n\n                     16\n\fance the interests at stake in making the ultimate statutory interpreta-\ntion.\n\nD.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, we hold that Congress acted within\nits constitutionally granted powers when it enacted the ADA and\n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act pursuant to§ 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\nIII.\n\nWe next come to the issue of whether the application of the ADA\nand § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is a valid exercise of Congress'\nauthority under the Commerce Clause. We find it unnecessary to\nreach this issue, however, since we have already found the statutes to\nbe a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.9\n\nIV.\n\nFinally, we reach the issue of sovereign immunity. The State of\nMaryland is entitled under the 11th Amendment of the United States\nConstitution to immunity from suit under the ADA unless Congress\nhas validly abrogated that immunity. The analysis is a two step pro-\ncess, since \"[i]n order to determine whether Congress has abrogated\nthe States' sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether\nCongress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the\nimmunity; . . . and second, whether Congress has acted pursuant to\na valid exercise of power.\" Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517\nU.S. at 55 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\nThe defense of sovereign immunity is not available to Appellees in\nthis case, as Appellees concede in their brief. (Appellees' S. Reply Br.\n_________________________________________________________________\n9 Appellants urge us to rule on the constitutionality of § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act under the Spending Clause. Even if we did find it nec-\nessary to rule on this issue, which we do not, we would be unable to do\nso due to the lack of evidence in the record on the status of federal fund-\ning made available to and accepted by RCI.\n\n                     17\n\fat 37). Since neither party disputes that Congress, through 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12202, unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the States'\nsovereign immunity under the ADA, and since we have held today\nthat the ADA is a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Four-\nteenth Amendment, we rule that the State of Maryland's sovereign\nimmunity has been validly abrogated and the State is subject to suit\nin this case. Since the District Court granted summary judgment in\nthis case based on the incorrect conclusion that the ADA and Rehabil-\nitation Act do not apply to state prisons, we do not have an adequately\ndeveloped record of the facts surrounding the Appellants' statutory\nclaims to make a determination about whether Appellees violated\nAppellants' statutory rights. We must, therefore, remand to the Dis-\ntrict Court for determination of the Appellants' statutory claims on\ntheir merits.\n\nV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find that application of the ADA and\nthe Rehabilitation Act to state prisons is a valid exercise of Congress'\nlegislative powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and that\nthe Appellees are validly subject to suit under these statutes.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\nMURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\nI join Judge Clarke's judgment and opinion.

Because Congress has failed validly to abrogate the State of\nMaryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity, and the State of Mary-\nland has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by accepting\nfederal funds, I respectfully dissent.1\n\nI.\n\nIt is well established that immunity under the Eleventh Amendment\naffects our subject matter jurisdiction. See Brown v. North Carolina\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 In enacting the ADA, Congress announced its intent \"to invoke the\nsweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the\n[F]ourteenth [A]mendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address\nthe major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with dis-\nabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(b)(4) (West 1995). Because of the pos-\nture of this case, however, I need not address whether Congress has the\nauthority to apply the ADA to state prisons under the Commerce Clause.\nIn their suit, Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. It\nis undisputed, however, that Plaintiffs sued Defendants in their official\ncapacities only. As a result, only the State of Maryland is potentially lia-\nble for monetary damages. As noted above, Congress cannot abrogate the\nState of Maryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity when enacting leg-\nislation pursuant to the Commerce Clause. See Seminole Tribe of Florida\nv.

In addition, none of the Plaintiffs,\nmost of whom are no longer incarcerated by the State of Maryland, are\ncurrently housed at the Roxbury Correctional Institution (RCI) in\nHagerstown, Maryland, the institution to which all of Plaintiffs' claims\nwere directed.

In Seminole, the\nSupreme Court specifically held that Congress had no authority to\nabrogate a State's sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amend-\nment when it enacted legislation pursuant to the Commerce Clause.\nSee id. at 59-73. In contrast, Congress may abrogate a State's sover-\neign immunity when it enacts valid legislation pursuant to Section 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.3See Fitzpatrick v.

In sum,\nthe Supreme Court held that Congress could not create a substantive\nconstitutional right to \"strict scrutiny\" for state action to which the\nSupreme Court had already determined that a lower standard of\nreview should apply. See Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2170. In so holding,\nthe Supreme Court made the following observation about RFRA:\n\n          The stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a\n          lack of proportionality or congruence between the means\n          adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector\n          can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the State\n          must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and\n          show that the law is the least restrictive means of furthering\n          its interest. . . . Laws valid under Smith would fall under\n          RFRA without regard to whether they had the object of sti-\n          fling or punishing free exercise. We make these observa-\n          tions . . . to illustrate the substantive alteration of [Smith's]\n          holding attempted by RFRA. Even assuming RFRA would\n\n                     25\n\f          be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test, say one\n          equivalent to intermediate scrutiny, the statute nevertheless\n          would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with\n          the attendant likelihood of invalidation.

As Judge Smith recently noted:\n\n          Both RFRA and the ADA purport to establish greater rights\n          for individuals against the states by increasing the measure\n          of judicial scrutiny for conflicting state actions to a level\n          higher than the Supreme Court has found appropriate under\n          the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . [T]he ADA increases the\n          judicial scrutiny level applicable for disabled persons by\n          requiring a closer nexus between the governmental purpose\n          and the governmental means than presently exists under\n          rational basis scrutiny. The ADA mandates an affirmative\n          justification for a state action that has the effect of inciden-\n          tally burdening these non-suspect classes of persons; a\n          state's actions are no longer presumptively valid if rationally\n          related to the interests that they serve. Instead, the state must\n          make \"reasonable accommodations\" for the disabled -- and\n          only once the state can show that it cannot \"reasonably\n          accommodate\" will the courts validate the state's chosen\n          policy.\n\nCoolbaugh v.

A panel of this\nCourt recently came to the same conclusion, i.e. , the ADA, like\nRFRA, impermissibly attempts to subject state action to higher level\nof judicial scrutiny than the Supreme Court has found appropriate\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brown, 166 F.3d at 708.\n\nAlthough the panel in Brown considered the validity of a regulation\npromulgated under the ADA, rather than the ADA itself, I believe that\nthe panel's reasoning controls the issue before us today. In holding\nthat the regulation at issue did not lie within the scope of Congress's\nenforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment, the panel in\nBrown specifically held that the level of judicial scrutiny required by\nthe ADA was incompatible with the more lenient rational basis test\nestablished in Cleburne. See id. In fact, as this Court noted, the ADA\nwas simply not intended to remedy violations of the standard estab-\nlished in Cleburne. See id. Rather, the ADA was intended to effect a\n\"`substantive alteration of [Cleburne's] holding.'\" Id. (quoting\n\n                    27\n\fBoerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2171). As a result, State actions that are ratio-\nnally based and perfectly constitutional under Cleburne are invalid\nunder the ADA. In that crucial respect, the ADA is nearly indistin-\nguishable from RFRA, i.e., the ADA is definitional rather than reme-\ndial. Indeed, as Judge Smith observed, by changing but a few words\nin Boerne, the Supreme Court could well have been speaking about\nthe ADA:\n\n          The stringent test [the ADA] demands of state laws\n          reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the\n          means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an\n          objector can show a substantial burden [of his rights under\n          the ADA], the State must [show that it cannot reasonably\n          accommodate him]. . . . Laws valid under [Cleburne] would\n          fall under [the ADA] without regard to whether they [were\n          rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose]. We\n          make these observations . . . to illustrate the substantive\n          alteration of [Cleburne's] holding attempted by [the ADA].\n          Even assuming [the ADA] would be interpreted in effect to\n          mandate some lesser test, say one equivalent to intermediate\n          scrutiny, the statute nevertheless would require searching\n          judicial scrutiny of state law with the attendant likelihood of\n          invalidation.

Like\nthe aforementioned judges, I conclude -- and would so conclude even\nwithout this Court's recent decision in Brown , which I believe to be\ncontrolling here -- that Congress exceeded its power under Section\n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting the ADA.\n\nCongress does not possess the power under Section 5 of the Four-\nteenth Amendment to supersede a Supreme Court decision construing\nthe substantive rights embodied by the Constitution. See United States\nv. Dickerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761256\"><a href=\"/opinion/761256/united-states-v-charles-thomas-dickerson-washington-legal-foundation-safe/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (4th Cir. 1999). In Cleburne, the\nSupreme Court held that the disabled are not a class entitled to\nincreased Fourteenth Amendment protection. In light of the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Cleburne, Congress does not have the power to\ndeclare otherwise in the ADA. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1\nCranch) 137 (1803). Following this Court's decision in Brown, which\nfaithfully applied the dictates of Boerne and Cleburne, I am con-\nstrained to conclude that Congress exceeded its authority under Sec-\ntion 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in attempting to abrogate\nMaryland's sovereign immunity with the ADA.\n\nB.\n\nIn Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111503\"><a href=\"/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), the\nSupreme Court considered whether a State waives its Eleventh\nAmendment immunity by accepting federal funds under a federal pro-\n\n                    29\n\fgram enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause. In Atascadero, the\nSupreme Court specifically held that \"the mere receipt of federal\nfunds cannot establish that a State has consented to suit in federal\ncourt.\" Id. at 246-47. Rather, the statute in question must expressly\n\"condition participation in the program funded under the Act on a\nState's consent to waive its constitutional immunity.\" Id. at 247.\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's decision in Atascadero, Con-\ngress amended the Rehabilitation Act as follows:\n\n          (1) A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh\n          Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from\n          suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the\n          Rehabilitation Act of 1973 . . . or the provisions of any other\n          Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of\n          Federal financial assistance.\n\n          (2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a statute\n          referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including remedies\n          both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation\n          to the same extent as such remedies are available for such\n          a violation in the suit against any public or private entity\n          other than a State.\n\n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-7(a) (West 1994). Without question, Congress,\nby enacting § 2000d-7(a), has expressed its intent to abrogate the\nStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Franklin v. Gwinnett\nCounty Pub. Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112696\"><a href=\"/opinion/112696/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1992) (noting that Congress, by\nenacting § 2000d-7, expressed its intent to\"abrogate\" the States'\nEleventh Amendment immunity under the Rehabilitation Act). I ques-\ntion, however, whether the language of § 2000d-7 sufficiently \"condi-\ntions\" a State's receipt of federal funds under the Rehabilitation Act\non that State's \"consent\" to waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nAs the Supreme Court recently noted, the doctrines of abrogation\nand waiver are \"completely unrelated.\" Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at\n63. With respect to the Eleventh Amendment, abrogation deals with\nCongress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nsubject unconsenting States to federal court jurisdiction. See\nAtascadero, 473 U.S. at 242-46. In contrast, waiver deals with, among\n\n                    30\n\fother things, Congress's power under the Spending Clause to condi-\ntion the receipt of federal funds on a State's consent to federal juris-\ndiction. See id. at 246-47. Thus, while statutory language may be\nsufficient to satisfy the demands of abrogation, it may nonetheless fail\nto satisfy the demands of waiver. Here, the language in question sim-\nply placed the State of Maryland on notice that it could be sued in\nfederal court if the Rehabilitation Act was a valid exercise of Con-\ngress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed,\nthe statute did not use the type of words or phrases, e.g. \"if,\" \"pro-\nvided that,\" \"when,\" \"after,\" \"as soon as,\" and \"subject to,\" that would\nindicate that the receipt of funds had been made conditional. Because\n§ 2000d-7(a) did not, as the Supreme Court requires, \"expressly con-\ndition\" the State of Maryland's receipt of federal funds under the\nRehabilitation Act on its consent to waive its constitutional immunity,\nthere is no indication that the State of Maryland knowingly and vol-\nuntarily waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nII.\n\nBecause the State of Maryland's Eleventh Amendment immunity\nwas neither abrogated nor waived, this case should have been dis-\nmissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\n                    31\n\f</pre>",
