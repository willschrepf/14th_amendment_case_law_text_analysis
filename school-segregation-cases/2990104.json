An amended petition, which now constitutes the operative\npetition for this claim, was filed on March 1, 2012. 3 On May 9, 2012, petitioner moved\n\n1\n  The E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2913 (Dec. 17, 2002) requires\nthat this decision be publically available. In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), petitioner has 14 days\nto identify and move to redact medical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an\nunwarranted invasion of privacy. If, upon review, I agree that the identified material fits within this\ndefinition, I will redact such material from public access.\n2\n The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program [“Vaccine Program”] is set forth in Part 2 of the\nNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755, codified as amended,\n42 U.S.C. § 300aa-10 et seq. (2012). All citations in this decision to individual sections of the Vaccine Act\nare to 42 U.S.C. § 300aa.\n3\n Hereinafter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, any reference to “petition” is to this Amended\nPetition.\n\fto amend the case caption to reflect her name change following remarriage, and to add\nJames Allen, A.A.’s father, as a petitioner.\n\n       In summary, petitioners claim that the measles, mumps, and rubella [“MMR”]\nvaccine A.A. received on October 23, 2000, caused her to suffer from “mitochondrial\npervasive developmental disorder” 4—a “particular form of autistic spectrum disorder\ncaused by an inborn error of mitochondrial metabolism.” Petition ¶¶ Introduction, 15.\nAccording to their experts, A.A. had an underlying mitochondrial disorder—present\nsince birth—that made her vulnerable to the inflammatory effects of the MMR vaccine.\nThe vaccine, which constituted an immunological stressor, overwhelmed A.A.’s already\nimpaired mitochondrial function and caused extensive cell death in her brain. As a\nresult of this damage, she experienced an acute regression and ultimately developed\nmitochondrial autism. See Petitioners’ Post-Hearing Brief, filed Nov. 27, 2013, at 30-60.\n\n      For the reasons set forth below, I find that the record does not contain\npreponderant evidence establishing entitlement to compensation.\n\n                                      I. Procedural History.\n\nA. The Omnibus Autism Program [“OAP”].\n\n       Beginning in 1997, but peaking numerically in 2002-03, thousands of petitions\nwere filed alleging either that the measles, mumps, and rubella [“MMR”] vaccine or\nthimerosal, an ethyl mercury preservative used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, caused\nASD. The sheer volume of petitions filed—more than 1,300 new petitions in 2002\nalone—led to the creation of the OAP. 5 Omnibus programs had been used previously\nto make causation determinations in groups of cases alleging that a particular vaccine\ncaused a specific injury, but the OAP was, by far, the largest such grouping of similar\ncases. 6 By filing their original short-form petition, an abbreviated petition authorized by\nAutism General Order #1, petitioners opted into the OAP.\n\n        Following a series of meetings with an informal advisory committee comprised of\npetitioners’ counsel representing many of the Program claimants plus legal and medical\nrepresentatives of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Office of Special\nMasters adopted a plan that would allow a period of discovery, followed by the selection\nand litigation of test cases on the theories of causation presented. Autism General\n\n4\n Synonymous with “mitochondrial pervasive development disorder” are the terms “autism secondary to\nmitochondrial disease” and “mitochondrial autism.” Tr. at 236-37.\n5\n  See Autism General Order #1, issued July 3, 2002 (found at 2002 WL 31696785, 2002 U.S. Claims\nLEXIS 365, or http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/Autism+General+Order1.pdf) (last\nvisited on Sept. 8, 2015).\n6\n See Hennessey v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 01-190V, 2009 WL 1709053 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. May 29, 2009),\naff’d, 91 Fed. Cl. 126 (2010) (discussing the different types of omnibus proceedings conducted in the\nVaccine Program).\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fOrder #1 at 2-3. The conclusions reached on general causation in the test cases would\nbe used to resolve the remaining individual claims. Id. at 3. Petitioners were allowed to\n“opt in” or “opt out” of the proceedings and future claimants could automatically “opt in”\nby filing the short form petition included as Attachment B to Autism General Order #1.\nAutism General Order #1 at 6-8.\n\n        Attorneys representing petitioners created the Petitioners’ Steering Committee\n[“PSC”] to coordinate the OAP litigative effort. The PSC acknowledged that there was\ninsufficient evidence at the time the OAP was created to prove vaccine causation, but\naverred that such evidence could be found through discovery and ongoing scientific\ninvestigations. Petitioners sought and received an extended period of time to conduct\ndiscovery and prepare to litigate test cases.\n\n       Nearly five years after the OAP was created, litigation in the test cases began.\nThe PSC presented two different theories on the causation of ASD in two sets of test\ncases. The first alleged that thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine, in\ncombination, could cause ASD (Theory 1). The second alleged that thimerosal-\ncontaining vaccines could cause ASD (Theory 2). 7\n\n       Decisions in each of the three Theory 1 test cases, which were tried in 2007,\nrejected petitioners’ causation theories. Cedillo v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 98-916V, 2009 WL\n331968 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Feb. 12, 2009), aff’d, 89 Fed. Cl. 158 (2009), aff’d, 617\nF.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Hazlehurst v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 03-654V, 2009 WL 332306\n(Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Feb. 12, 2009), aff’d, 88 Fed. Cl. 473 (2009), aff’d, 604 F.3d 1343\n(Fed. Cir. 2010); Snyder v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 01-162V, 2009 WL 332044 (Fed. Cl. Spec.\nMstr. Feb. 12, 2009), aff’d, 88 Fed. Cl. 706 (2009). 8\n\n       Decisions in the three Theory 2 test cases, which were tried in 2008, also\nrejected the causation theory presented. Petitioners did not seek review of the special\nmasters’ decisions. Dwyer, 2010 WL 892250; King v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 03-584V, 2010\nWL 892296 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Mar. 12, 2010); Mead, 2010 WL 892248.\n\n       An impressive body of medical and scientific evidence was adduced in the OAP\ntest cases, with the three special masters who heard this evidence finding that the issue\nof vaccine causation was “not a close case.” See, e.g., King, 2010 WL 892296, at *90\n(emphasis in original); Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *198. Each of the three special\n7\n  A detailed discussion of the OAP can be found at Dwyer v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 03-1202V, 2010 WL\n892250, at *2 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Mar. 12, 2010). In keeping with the intent that the OAP test case\nevidence be available to aid in resolving the remaining OAP cases, the evidence (including expert\nreports, transcripts of testimony, trial presentation materials (trial exhibits), and lists of the medical\njournals and other documents filed by the parties) is posted on the Court of Federal Claims website\n(http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/docket-omnibus-autism-proceeding) (last visited on May 11, 2015). The\nparties in the test case hearings all filed explicit written consent to make these materials publicly\navailable. See, e.g., Mead v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 03-215V, 2010 WL 892248 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Mar. 12,\n2010), at *1 n.1 (referencing petitioners’ and respondent’s written consent in that case).\n8\n    Petitioners did not appeal the Court of Federal Claims decision in Snyder to the Federal Circuit.\n\n\n                                                       3\n\fmasters independently determined that the medical theories advanced were not reliable\nand that the test case petitioners had failed to produce preponderant evidence of\ncausation. The OAP test case litigation concluded in 2010, with the last Federal Circuit\ndecision affirming the dismissal of the final Theory 1 test case. 9\n\n         During the period between the test case hearings and the final appellate action\non the test case decisions, petitioners in this case, like others in the OAP, were ordered\nto file the medical records necessary to establish that the petition was timely filed. See\nOrder, issued Mar. 13, 2009, at 5. Petitioners filed the required medical records on\nJune 11, 2009 and July 22, 2009. See Petitioners’ Exhibits [“Pet. Exs.”] 1-10. On\nAugust 14, 2009, respondent filed a statement indicating that the claim was timely filed\nand involved a diagnosis of ASD. Because the claim was determined to have been\ntimely filed, petitioners were ordered to file all remaining medical records. See Order,\nissued Aug. 24, 2009, at 1-2. Petitioners filed the required medical records on\nNovember 19, 2009 and December 23, 2009. See Pet. Exs. 11-14.\n\n       With appellate review completed, orders were issued on a rolling basis to the\nremaining 4,800 petitioners, requiring them to inform the court whether they intended to\ndismiss their case or proceed on a different theory or with different evidence.\nPetitioners were ordered to inform the court if they wished to proceed with their claim.\nSee Order, issued May 12, 2011, at 3. If petitioners wished to continue with their claim,\nthey were ordered to file an amended petition, setting forth their theory of causation. 10\nId. During the next ten months, petitioners filed additional medical records. See Pet.\nExs. 15-20. On March 1, 2012, they filed their amended petition.\n\nB. Procedural History Post-OAP.\n\n      On March 15, 2012, I held a telephonic status conference to discuss petitioners’\namended petition and next steps in this case. I ordered petitioners to file any\noutstanding medical records and a supplemental statement of completion by March 30,\n2012, and expert reports by May 14, 2012. See Scheduling Order, issued Mar. 15,\n2012.\n\n        On March 30, 2012, petitioners filed a supplemental statement of completion\nindicating that they had filed all of the medical records to substantiate the amended\npetition.\n\n        After requesting and receiving additional time to file their expert reports (see\nMotions, filed May 14, 2012; July 16, 2012), petitioners filed an expert report, curriculum\nvitae [“CV”], and two supporting documents from Dr. Richard Kelley; and an expert\nreport, CV, and one article from Dr. Andrew Zimmerman on July 19, 2012. See Pet.\n9\n    Cedillo v. Sec’y, HHS, 617 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\n10\n  Petitioners were cautioned that the special masters did not intend to re-litigate the test case theories,\nand that a reasonable basis to proceed would require either new evidence on the old theories or new\ntheories of causation. See Order, issued May 12, 2011, at 2.\n\n\n                                                      4\n\fExs. 23-26. 11 Although both experts treated A.A., they did so long after onset of her\nASD symptoms.\n\n       On November 16, 2012, respondent filed her supplemental Rule 4(c) report; an\nexpert report, CV, and eight articles from Dr. Stephen Cederbaum; and an expert report,\nCV, and seven articles from Dr. Max Wiznitzer, after seeking one extension of time.\nSee Respondent’s Rule 4(c) report; Respondent’s Exhibits [“Res. Exs.”] A-S.\n\n       On January 9, 2013, I held a telephonic status conference pursuant to Vaccine\nRule 5 12 to discuss the expert reports and positions of the parties. During the status\nconference, the parties agreed that the case was ready for a hearing to address the\nexperts’ disagreement with regard to causation. I noted that certain factual disputes still\nexisted and that I would need the experts to testify on these issues as well. I ordered\nthe parties to file a joint status report by January 24, 2013, providing possible hearing\ndates. See Scheduling Order, issued Jan. 9, 2013.\n\n       After the parties filed their joint status report, I scheduled a four-day entitlement\nhearing in Washington, D.C. from July 9-12, 2013. See Pre-Hearing Order, issued Jan.\n28, 2013. On April 5, 2013, I ordered the parties to file any outstanding evidence on\nwhich they intended to rely by May 24, 2013. See Pre-Hearing Order, issued Apr. 5,\n2013, at 1. I also ordered the parties to file (1) a joint submission identifying any\ndisputed and non-disputed issues; (2) a memorandum containing their basic factual\ncontentions and applicable legal authority; (3) an affidavit from each fact witness, if not\npreviously filed; and (4) witness lists. Id. at 2.\n\n        Over the next several months, petitioners timely filed additional medical\nliterature, 13 updated school and medical records, and relevant video evidence.\nRespondent also filed additional medical literature. 14 On June 10, 2013, the parties filed\ntheir pre-hearing submissions. Petitioners indicated that they would be calling four\nwitnesses, including two expert witnesses, to testify at the hearing. See Pet. Pre-\nHearing Submission, filed June 10, 2013, at 34. Respondent indicated that she would\nbe calling both of her expert witnesses to testify. See Res. Pre-Hearing Submission,\nfiled June 10, 2013 (ECF No. 80), at 16. Petitioners also filed the affidavits of James\nAllen (A.A.’s father) and Susan Edick (A.A.’s aunt), A.A.’s vaccination record, and\nadditional video and photographic evidence.\n\n11\n  The supporting documents from Dr. Kelley included A.A.’s amino acid profile (Pet. Ex. 23A) and an\nunpublished protocol titled “Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Autism and Mitochondrial Disease\n(Pet. Ex. 23B). Doctor Zimmerman submitted J. Poling, et al., Developmental Regression and\nMitochondrial Dysfunction In a Child with Autism, J. CHILD NEUROL., 21 (2): 170-72 (2006), filed as Pet.\nEx. 25, Tab A [hereinafter “Poling, Pet. Ex. 25A”].\n12\n     RCFC, Appendix B.\n13\n     See Pet. Exs. 27-59, 65-74.\n14\n     See Res. Exs. T-CC.\n\n\n                                                    5\n\f       Finally, the parties filed a joint submission identifying the disputed and non-\ndisputed issues. See Joint Pre-Hearing Submission, filed June 10, 2013 (ECF No. 79).\nSpecifically, the parties disputed (1) “the state of A.A.’s health and development prior to\nOctober 23, 2000”; (2) whether “A.A. suffer[ed] a developmental regression after her\nreceipt of the October 23, 2000, MMR vaccination[,]” and, if so, when the regression\noccurred; (3) whether the “October 23, 2000, MMR vaccinations cause[d]-in-fact any of\nA.A.’s subsequently diagnosed developmental, neurological, or mitochondrial issues”;\nand (4) whether “A.A. has a mitochondrial disease[.]” Id. at 1-2.\n\n        On June 20, 2013, petitioners filed additional video evidence. See Pet. Ex. 80.\nOn June 28, 2013, I held a telephonic status conference with the parties to discuss the\npending hearing. I also discussed the video evidence filed by petitioners. Petitioners’\ncounsel confirmed that the video was a compilation of clips taken from a more complete\nrecording. I explained that although the edited clips could be used during testimony, the\nentire recording should be filed into the record for review. I also requested that any\nadditional videos of A.A. from the first two years of her life be filed, if available. See\nScheduling Order, issued July 1, 2013.\n\n       In compliance with my order, petitioners filed an unedited version of the video.\nSee Pet. Ex. 81. Petitioners also filed a status report stating that “after a diligent\nsearch, . . . they were unable to locate any additional videos of A.A. from one to two\nyears of age.” See Status Report, filed July 2, 2013, at 2.\n\n       The entitlement hearing was held as scheduled, from July 9-12, 2013. Four\nphysicians testified at the four day hearing. Mr. Allen and Ms. Edick also testified in\nperson. A.A. also attended part of the hearing, and I had the opportunity to meet and\nspeak with her. Following the hearing, I set a schedule for the identification and\ncorrection of transcript errors and the submission of post-hearing briefs. See Post-\nHearing Order, issued on July 30, 2013.\n\n       On August 1, 2013, petitioners filed several exhibits used during the hearing.\nSee Trial Exhibits [“Trial Exs.”] 1-5. On September 3, 2013, I filed Court Exhibit I, a\nmedical journal article, and provided the parties and their experts an opportunity to\ncomment on the exhibit. See Res. Resp. to Court’s Sept. 3, 2013 Order and Ex., filed\nSept. 30, 2013; Res. Ex. DD; Pet. Resp. to Court’s Sept. 3, 2013 Order and Ex., filed\nOct. 3, 2013; Pet. Ex. 82.\n\n       On September 6, 2013, the parties submitted their joint corrections to the\ntranscript. A corrected version of the transcript was filed on September 19, 2013. 15\n\n      Simultaneous post-hearing briefs were filed on November 27, 2013. On\nDecember 12, 2013, the parties submitted responses to the post-hearing briefs,\ncompleting the record.\n\n\n15\n     All references to the transcript are to the corrected version.\n\n\n                                                         6\n\f              II. Legal Standards Applying to Off-Table Causation Claims.\n\n        When petitioners allege an off-Table injury, eligibility for compensation is\nestablished when, by a preponderance of the evidence, petitioners demonstrate that the\nvaccinee received, in the United States, a vaccine appearing on the Table and\nsustained an illness, disability, injury, or condition caused by the vaccine or experienced\na significant aggravation of a preexisting condition. They must also demonstrate that\nthe condition has persisted for more than six months. 16 Vaccine Act litigation rarely\nconcerns whether the vaccine appears on the Table, the geographical location of\nadministration, or whether the symptoms have persisted for the requisite time. Rather,\nin the very small minority of Vaccine Act cases that proceed to a hearing, the most\ncommon issue to be resolved by the special master is whether the injury alleged was\ncaused by the vaccine.\n\n        To establish legal causation in an off-Table case, Vaccine Act petitioners must\nestablish by preponderant evidence: (1) a reliable medical theory causally connecting\nthe vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that\nthe vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a proximate temporal relationship\nbetween vaccination and injury. Althen v. Sec’y, HHS, 418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir.\n2005); see de Bazan v. Sec’y, HHS, 539 F.3d 1347, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Caves v.\nSec’y, HHS, 100 Fed. Cl. 119, 132 (2011), aff’d per curiam, 463 Fed. Appx. 932 (Fed.\nCir. 2012) (specifying that each Althen factor must be established by preponderant\nevidence). The applicable level of proof is the “traditional tort standard of ‘preponderant\nevidence.’” Moberly v. Sec’y, HHS, 592 F.3d 1315, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing de\nBazan, 539 F.3d at 1351); Pafford v. Sec’y, HHS, 451 F.3d 1352, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2006);\nCapizzano v. Sec’y, HHS, 440 F.3d 1317, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Althen, 418 F.3d at\n1278). Although special masters are not bound by the formal rules of evidence\ngenerally applicable in federal courts, they are required to find evidence reliable before\nthey may consider it. Knudsen v. Sec’y, HHS, 35 F.3d 543, 548-49 (Fed. Cir. 1994)\n(Petitioner has the burden to present a reliable and reputable medical theory, which\nmust be “legally probable, not medically or scientifically certain.”); Daubert v. Merrell\nDow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579, 590 (1993) (holding that scientific evidence and\nexpert opinions must be reliable to be admissible). The preponderance standard\n“requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its\nnonexistence.” In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 371 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)\n(internal quotation and citation omitted).\n\n       Another formulation of the causation requirement in off-Table cases is the “Can it\ncause?” and “Did it cause?” inquiries used in toxic tort litigation. These queries are also\nreferred to as issues of general and specific causation. Prong 1 of Althen has been\ncharacterized as an alternative formulation of the “Can it cause?” or general causation\nquery. Prong 2 of Althen, the requirement for a logical sequence of cause and effect\n\n16\n  Section 13(a)(1)(A). This section provides that petitioner must demonstrate “by a preponderance of the\nevidence the matters required in the petition by section 300aa–11(c)(1) . . . .” Section 11(c)(1) contains\nthe factors listed above, along with others not relevant to this case.\n\n\n                                                    7\n\fbetween the vaccine and the injury, has been characterized as addressing the “Did it\ncause?” or specific causation query. See Pafford v. Sec’y, HHS, No. 01-165V, 2004 WL\n1717359, at *4 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. July 16, 2004), aff’d, 64 Fed. Cl. 19 (2005), aff’d,\n451 F.3d 1352 (2006). Prong 3 of Althen, the requirement that the injury sustained\noccur within a medically appropriate interval after vaccination, is subsumed into the\nother inquiries. Even if a particular vaccine has been causally associated with an injury,\npetitioner must still establish facts and circumstances that make it more likely than not\nthat this vaccine caused the particular injury. Timing may be one of those\ncircumstances.\n\n        Whether a case is analyzed under Althen or the “Can it cause?” formulation,\npetitioners are not required to establish identification and proof of specific biological\nmechanisms, as “the purpose of the Vaccine Act’s preponderance standard is to allow\nthe finding of causation in a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines\naffect the human body.” Althen, 418 F.3d at 1280. Petitioners need not show that the\nvaccination was the sole cause, or even the predominant cause, of the injury or\ncondition; showing that the vaccination was a “substantial factor” 17 in causing the\ncondition, and was a “but for” cause, are sufficient for recovery. Shyface v. Sec’y, HHS,\n165 F.3d 1344, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 1999); see also Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1355 (petitioners\nmust establish that a vaccination was a substantial factor and that harm would not have\noccurred in the absence of vaccination). Petitioners cannot be required to show\n“epidemiologic studies, rechallenge, the presence of pathological markers or genetic\ndisposition, or general acceptance in the scientific or medical communities to establish a\nlogical sequence of cause and effect,” Capizzano, 440 F.3d at 1325, but the special\nmaster may certainly consider such evidence when filed. Andreu v. Sec’y, HHS, 569\nF.3d 1367, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (Special masters may consider medical literature and\nepidemiological evidence, when it is submitted, in “reaching an informed judgment as to\nwhether a particular vaccine likely caused a particular injury.”). Causation is determined\non a case by case basis, with “no hard and fast per se scientific or medical rules.”\nKnudsen, 35 F.3d at 548 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Close calls regarding causation must be\nresolved in favor of petitioners. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1280; but see Knudsen, 35 F.3d at\n550 (when evidence is in equipoise, the party with the burden of proof fails to meet that\nburden).\n\n          In Vaccine Act cases, special masters are frequently confronted by expert\nwitnesses with diametrically opposing positions on causation. When experts disagree,\nmany factors influence a factfinder to accept some testimony and reject other contrary\ntestimony. As the Federal Circuit noted, “[a]ssessments as to the reliability of expert\ntestimony often turn on credibility determinations, particularly in cases . . . where there\nis little supporting evidence for the expert’s opinion.” Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1325-26.\n17\n  The Restatement (Third) of Torts has eliminated “substantial factor” in the factual cause analysis. § 26\ncmt. j (2010). Because the Federal Circuit has held that the causation analysis in the Restatement\n(Second) of Torts applies to off-Table Vaccine Act cases (see Walther v. Sec’y, HHS, 485 F.3d 1146,\n1151 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Shyface, 165 F.3d at 1352), this change does not affect the determination of legal\ncause in Vaccine Act cases: whether the vaccination is a “substantial factor” is still a consideration in\ndetermining whether it is the legal cause of an injury.\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fObjective factors, including the qualifications, training, and experience of the expert\nwitnesses; the extent to which their proffered opinions are supported by reliable medical\nresearch and other testimony; and the factual basis for their opinions are all significant\nfactors in determining what testimony to credit and what to reject. Lalonde v. Sec’y,\nHHS, 746 F.3d 1334, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (noting that “as the finder of fact, the special\nmaster was responsible for assessing the reliability of [the expert’s] testimony by looking\nfor reliable medical or scientific support” (citing Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1324-25)).\n\n       Congress contemplated that special masters would weigh and evaluate opposing\nexpert opinions in determining whether petitioners have met their burden of proof.\nCongress clearly specified petitioners’ burden of proof in off-Table cases as the\npreponderance of the evidence standard. It directed special masters to consider the\nevidence as a whole, but stated that special masters are not bound by any particular\npiece of evidence contained in the record. 18 In weighing and evaluating expert opinions\nin Vaccine Act cases, the same factors the Supreme Court has considered important in\ndetermining their admissibility provide the weights and counterweights. See Kumho\nTire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 149-50 (1999); Terran v. Sec’y, HHS, 195 F.3d\n1302, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1999). As the Supreme Court has noted, a trial court is not\nrequired to accept the ipse dixit of any expert’s medical or scientific opinion because the\n“court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data\nand the opinion proffered.” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997).\n\n         Although the Federal Rules of Evidence and cases interpreting them are not\nbinding on special masters, they can guide their decisions. Daubert, which interpreted\nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, provides a useful framework for evaluating\nscientific evidence in Program cases. Terran, 195 F.3d at 1316 (concluding that it was\nreasonable for the special master to use Daubert to evaluate the reliability of an expert’s\ntestimony); Cedillo, 617 F.3d at 1339 (noting that special masters are to consider all\nrelevant and reliable evidence filed in a case and may use Daubert factors in their\nevaluation of expert testimony); Davis v. Sec’y, HHS, 94 Fed. Cl. 53, 67 (2010)\n(describing the Daubert factors as an “acceptable evidentiary-gauging tool with respect\nto persuasiveness of expert testimony already admitted . . . by special masters in\nvaccine cases”); see also Snyder, 88 Fed. Cl. 706, 718 (2009) (quoting Ryman v. Sec’y,\nHHS, 65 Fed. Cl. 35, 40-41 (2005) (special masters perform gatekeeping function when\ndetermining “whether a particular petitioner’s expert medical testimony supporting\nbiological probability may be admitted or credited or otherwise relied upon” and as a\n“trier-of-fact [a special master] may properly consider the credibility and applicability of\nmedical theories”)). The special master’s use of the Daubert factors to evaluate the\nreliability of expert opinions in Vaccine Act cases has been cited with approval by the\nFederal Circuit more recently in Andreu, 569 F.3d at 1379 and Moberly, 592 F.3d at\n1324. See also Vaughan v. Sec’y, HHS, 107 Fed. Cl. 212, 222 (2012) (“The Federal\n18\n  See § 13(a)(1)(A) (preponderance standard); § 13(a)(1) (“Compensation shall be awarded . . . if the\nspecial master or court finds on the record as a whole . . . .” ); § 13(b)(1) (indicating that the court or\nspecial master shall consider the entire record in determining if petitioner is entitled to compensation and\nspecial master is not bound by any “diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summary”\ncontained in the record).\n\n\n                                                      9\n\fCircuit has repeatedly stated that the Special Master may refer to Daubert to assess\nreliability of expert testimony in vaccine cases.”). Special masters decide questions of\ncredibility, plausibility, probability, and reliability, and ultimately determine to which side\nthe balance of the evidence is tipped. See Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1359.\n\n       Bearing all these legal standards in mind, I now turn to the evidence presented in\nthis case.\n\n                          III. Summary of Relevant Medical Records.\n\nA. Early Medical and Developmental History.\n\n      A.A., petitioners’ first child, was born in mid-July, 1999. She was a healthy\nnewborn, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. 19 Pet. Ex. 1, p. 19. Her newborn exam was\nnormal. 20 Pet. Ex. 3, pp. 5, 16.\n\n      During her first year of life, A.A. received routine childhood immunizations 21 and\nwas generally healthy with no major illnesses. Her medical records from Countryside\nPediatrics [“Countryside”], her primary care provider, 22 reflect scheduled well child\nexaminations, as well as periodic unscheduled visits due to minor illnesses.\n\n       A.A. was seen for her two-month well child visit on September 17, 1999, and was\nnoted to be “doing very well.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 13. The medical report indicated a normal\nphysical examination, and normal development as measured by six defined skills,\nincluding whether she regarded a face directly and responded to sound. 23\n19\n   The Apgar score is a numerical assessment of a newborn’s condition (with lower numbers indicating\nproblems), usually taken at one minute and five minutes after birth. The score is derived from the infant’s\nheart rate, respiration, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color, with from zero to two points awarded in\neach of the five categories. See DORLAND’S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY (32d ed. 2012)\n[“DORLAND’S”] at 1682; NELSON TEXTBOOK OF PEDIATRICS (19th ed. 2011) [“NELSON’S ”] at 536-37.\n20\n  She initially failed the audiological evaluation; however, upon re-testing, her hearing was found to be\nwithin normal limits. Pet. Ex. 3, pp. 13-15.\n21\n   On September 17, 1999, A.A received her first vaccinations, which included the combined diphtheria,\ntetanus, and acellular pertussis [“DTaP”]; Haemophilus influenzae Type b [“Hib”]; and the inactivated polio\n[“IPV”] vaccines. Pet. Ex. 9, p.1. She received the second round of the same vaccines at her two month\nwell child visit on November 19, 1999. Id. She received her third DTaP and Hib vaccines at her six\nmonth well child visit on January 21, 2000. Id. She received the varicella and her first hepatitis B\nvaccines at her one year well child visit on July 26, 2000. Id.\n22\n  A.A. was evaluated by a variety of health care professionals at Countryside Pediatrics, including\nmedical doctors, certified pediatric nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. These professionals will all\nbe referred to as her “pediatrician,” regardless of their credentials.\n23\n   A.A.’s pediatrician made use of developmental checklists with very specific developmental milestones\nfor specific ages. Those for the two month visit incuded: (1) Regards face directly; (2) Lifts head when\nupright; (3) Coos; (4) Smiles; (5) Grasps object when placed in hands; (6) Responds to sound. Pet. Ex.\n9, p. 13.\n\n\n                                                     10\n\f        On November 11, 1999, at about four months of age, she was seen for an upper\nrespiratory infection [“URI”]. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 62. She had awakened screaming, with\nfever, irritability, and loss of appetite. Id. Her pediatrician gave instructions to call if her\nfever exceeded 100 degrees or if she did not improve within three days. Id. On\nNovember 16, 1999, she was seen due to congestion, irritability, and difficulty sleeping,\nand was diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Id., p. 61. She returned again on November 19,\n1999, with URI symptoms and continued congestion. Id., p. 60.\n\n       At her six-month well child visit on January 21, 2000, A.A.’s growth and\ndevelopment were normal. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 12. The medical report indicated a normal\nphysical examination, and normal development as measured by eight defined skills,\nincluding whether she laughed and babbled or could sit with little support. 24 Id. On\nJanuary 26, 2000, she returned due to a persistent cough and runny nose, which was\ndiagnosed as a URI. Id., p. 59. She had been pulling at her ears, as well. Id.\n\n        A.A. was seen for her nine-month well child visit on April 21, 2000. Pet. Ex. 9, p.\n11. The medical report contained no written comments, but indicated a normal physical\nexamination, and normal development as measured by seven defined skills, including\nthe ability to imitate “mama, dada.” 25 Id. On April 26, 2000, A.A. returned due to\ncongestion and a raspy voice. Id., p. 58. After examination, she was diagnosed with\nright otitis media [“OM”], bilateral conjunctivitis, and a URI. Id.\n\n       On July 24, 2000, A.A. attended her one-year well child examination,\naccompanied by her nanny. She was assessed as normal with regard to illness and\naccidents, and her temperament, as reported by the nanny, was “no problem.” The\ncorresponding medical report indicated a normal physical examination, and normal\ndevelopment as measured by eight defined skills, including whether she could walk two\nto three steps or say one to three words. 26 Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10.\n\nB. Administration of Allegedly Causal Vaccination.\n\n       As reflected by the medical evidence of record, A.A. did not visit any healthcare\nprovider between her one-year well child visit and her 15-month checkup. At that\nexamination, on October 23, 2000, she was tugging at her ears and was reported to\noften have a cold. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 9. Her physical examination was normal, although her\ntympanic membranes had fluid. Id. She also had normal development as measured by\n\n24\n  The eight assessed developmental skills were: (1) Reaches for toys; (2) No head lag; (3) Laughs,\nbabbles; (4) Peak-a-boo, pat-a-cake; (5) Sits with little support; (6) Fearful of strangers; (7) Rolls over; (8)\nBears own weight. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 12.\n25\n  The seven assessed developmental skills were: (1) Pincer grasp; (2) Holds bottle; (3) Imitates mama,\ndada; (4) Peak-a-boo, pat-a-cake: (5) Sits well alone; (6) Crawls; (7) Pulls up to stand. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 11.\n26\n  The eight assessed developmental skills were: (1) Precise pincer grasp; (2) Stands alone; (3) Walks 2-\n3 steps; (4) Says 1-3 words; (5) Imitates sounds; (6) Eats and drinks sitting up; (7) Points; (8) Waves\n“bye-bye.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10.\n\n\n                                                       11\n\ffive defined skills, including whether she could walk well alone and point at one to two\nbody parts. 27 Id. At this examination she received her first MMR, second hepatitis B,\nand fourth Hib vaccines. Id., p.1. Petitioners claim this MMR vaccine was causal of\nA.A.’s current condition.\n\nC. Growth and Development Following the October 23, 2000 Vaccination.\n\n        The first reported illness following her 15-month check-up and MMR vaccination\nwas nearly two months later, on December 18, 2000, when she was treated for a viral\ninfection and early OM. Pet. Ex. 9, p.57. The examination report from that encounter\nreflected that A.A. had vomited the previous night, and awakened with a fever; however,\nthere is no mention of any behavioral or developmental concerns. Id. On January 25,\n2001, she was treated at the Loudon Healthcare Emergency Room for second degree\nburns to her hands after she touched a hot fireplace screen at home. Pet. Ex. 22, pp.\n18-20.\n\n       A.A. was seen for her 18-month 28 well child visit on March 1, 2001. Additionally,\nshe had a runny nose and was teething. The examination report noted that the burns to\nher hands were healing well. Some issues with the previous nanny were reported, but\nA.A. was “opening up more” now with a new nanny. Her physical examination was\ncompletely normal, except for a left ear infection. She was prescribed an antibiotic, with\norders to follow up in 10 to 14 days. She was behind on two vaccinations (DTaP and\nIPV), which could be administered at the follow-up visit. Her development was again\nmeasured against a defined set of skills; for the first time, A.A. did not display some of\nthe expected skills. The report indicated that she was fully able to drink from a cup,\nwalk up steps, point to body parts, and scribble. However, she had not mastered using\na spoon and only took off some clothes. Her ability to build three to four block towers\nwas not checked as achieved. And, the response to whether she could speak 4-10\nwords was “? consistency.” Despite diagnosed acute left OM, she was evaluated as a\n“well 19 month old.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 8.\n\n         A note dated March 1, 2001 continued the report from A.A.’s 18 month well child\nvisit. It stated:\n\n          Mom reports [decreased] language skills. Baby seems to understand [but]\n          sometimes refuses to talk/play games. Mom attributes above to change in\n          nanny – mom wasn’t pleased with nanny. Also child burned hand in\n          [January 2001]. New nanny seems knowledgeable [about] child\n          dev[elopment]. Takes [baby] to play groups, library, reads & sings, etc.\n          Mom to continue to talk to baby, play games, read & sing – but to back off\n27\n  The five evaluated developmental skills were: (1) Drinks from cup; (2) Walks well alone; (3) Crawls up\nsteps; (4) Rolls and tosses ball; (5) Points at 1-2 body parts. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 9. Language or vocabulary\nwas not assessed on the examination record, but the Denver II developmental screening form reflected\nthat she had at least three words at 15 months of age. Id., p. 7\n28\n     A.A. was more than 19 months old at the time of the visit.\n\n\n                                                       12\n\f        if this becomes a power struggle [with baby]. [Follow up] if concerned or if\n        not seeing progress in language dev[elopment] over [the] next 2 months.\n\nPet. Ex. 9, p. 18.\n\n      The examiner also completed the medical portion of the Virginia School Entrance\nHealth Form, which was required prior to A.A.’s admission to school. The report\ngenerally mirrored the findings noted in the Countryside Pediatrics record described\nabove and estimated her developmental level to be within normal limits. Pet. Ex. 7, p.\n13.\n\n        A.A. next visited Countryside on March 23, 2001, due to coughing and\ncongestion. Also of concern was a reported increase in hearing loss after the “past 3\n[bilateral] OM” and her ear tugging. She was diagnosed with a URI and bilateral OM. A\nnote indicated that A.A.’s “language skills [were] improving” and that she could say “uh-\noh” and “bye, bye.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 56.\n\n       Several weeks later, on April 2, 2001, A.A. was treated for OM. She had\ncontinued tugging at her ears, was “generally feeling miserable,” and had been\n“sleeping a lot.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 55. She also received her third hepatitis B and IPV and\nher fourth DTaP vaccines at this examination. Id., p. 1.\n\n        On May 7, 2001, A.A. returned to follow up on her three ear infections,\naccompanied by her nanny. The examination report noted concerns regarding A.A.’s\nhearing, speech/language delay, and vocabulary of about six words. She was\ndiagnosed again with OM. For the first time, her pediatrician assessed her as\ndevelopmentally delayed in speech. Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 19, 54; see also id., p. 7 (Denver\nII). 29\n\n       A.A. was next seen on June 13, 2001, for a possible urinary tract infection\n[“URI”]. Her mother thought she was having problems urinating. She was noted as\ncrying, but consolable at the appointment. Mrs. Allen was to call if the concerns\npersisted. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 53.\n\nD. Diagnosis of and Evaluations for Speech Delay.\n\n      A.A.’s two-year well child visit took place on August 6, 2001. Her physical\nexamination was normal. However, she was again diagnosed as having a\ndevelopmental speech delay. The examination was “very difficult,” because A.A. was\n\n29\n   The Denver Developmental Screening Test [“Denver II”] was a widely used assessment for examining\nthe developmental progress of young children; however, in recent years the test has fallen out of favor\nwith some early childhood organizations. See, e.g., Minnesota Department of Health,\nhttp://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/fh/mch/webcourse/ devscrn/instrument.cfm (last visited Sept. 8, 2015)\n(not recommended as a developmental screening instrument). The test’s publisher closed in 2015; the\ntesting materials are no longer available for sale. See Denver Developmental Materials, Inc.,\nhttp://denverii.com/ (last visited Sept. 8, 2015).\n\n\n                                                   13\n\fapprehensive and screamed throughout the encounter. As a result, the examination\nreport, including the nine-item developmental skills checklist, was not thoroughly\ncompleted. The two skills that were evaluated (“2-3 word sentences” and “repeats\nwords”) were marked as abnormal. 30 She was referred for speech evaluation. Pet. Ex.\n9, p. 4.\n\n       A hearing test on August 27, 2001, was inconclusive, and she was re-evaluated\non August 31, 2001. Although testing was again incomplete because A.A. “was very\nactive and crying,” the obtained results suggested “normal hearing in at least one ear.”\nThe audiologist recommended A.A. undergo a speech and language evaluation. Pet.\nEx. 5, p. 1.\n\n        That speech and language evaluation was conducted on September 5, 2001.\nA.A.’s nanny accompanied her to the appointment and served as the informant\nregarding her daily communication skills and behaviors. Her parents supplied a written\nhistory. The report noted that A.A.’s medical history was significant for ear infections.\nHer developmental milestones were reportedly age-appropriate. Although she was\nclumsy with walking, she was able to run and climb with coordination. Her fine motor\nskills were still developing. Pet. Ex. 5, p. 4. Her speech and language landmarks were\nreported “as age appropriate to a point.” Id., p. 5. She reportedly spoke “her first word\n‘Quack’ at 1 year and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months.” Id.\nHowever,\n\n          [s]he stopped speaking after having 3 ear infections in a row..[31] She has\n          just begun to put 2 words together. She has an estimated expressive\n          vocabulary of 30 words. In the past 6 months she has begun to babble a\n          lot again. She cries, points, and tugs, as her primary means of\n          communicating with her parents and nanny. She does not communicate\n          with peers. [She] reportedly will learn new words, but when she does, . . .\n          previous learning is lost.\n\nId.\n\n       After testing and examination, the speech-language pathologist provided the\nfollowing assessment:\n\n          [A.A.] is an attractive young child who would not engage with this\n          examiner. Based on clinical observations and caregiver’s report, she\n          presents with delayed receptive language skills and gaps in her\n          expressive language development. Of greater significance are her poor\n          pragmatic skills (eye contact, joint attention, etc.) and atypical behaviors:\n30\n  The nine assessed developmental skills were: (1) Uses spoon well; (2) Eats using spoon; (3) Walks up\nsteps; (4) Knows name; (5) Runs without falling; (6) Builds 5-6 blocks; (7) 2-3 word sentences; (8)\nRepeats words; (9) Can do simple tasks. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 4.\n31\n     A.A. was seen for these ear infections on March 1 and 23, and April 2, 2001. Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 8, 54-56.\n\n\n                                                      14\n\f          preference of objects over people, sustained odd play, tantrums,\n          resistance to changes in routine, showing distress for reasons not\n          apparent to others, lack of response to verbal cues (although hearing tests\n          in normal range), aloof manner, fascination with venetian blinds/lights,\n          desire to hold objects daily, and walking on tip toes. These combined\n          behaviors may suggest that she is experiencing more than just a\n          developmental delay.\n\nPet. Ex. 5, p. 11. The speech pathologist “suspect[ed] autism” and recommended that\nA.A. “receive evaluation from a pediatric neurologist and/or developmental psychologist\nto assess communication and behavioral patterns to determine/rule-out underlying\nproblems.” Id.\n\nE. Autism Evaluations.\n\n       On September 16, 2001, A.A. was seen for a neurologic consultation with Dr.\nBennett L. Lavenstein at Children’s National Medical Center [“Children’s Hospital”], in\nWashington, D.C. In the resultant report, Dr. Lavenstein noted that A.A. had been\nreferred by a speech pathologist who perceived “features of autism” in some of her\nbehaviors. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96. He recounted that A.A., by history, had\n\n          [d]emonstrated normal behavior in the neonatal course. Subsequently\n          sat, walked and was appropriate in her milestones . . . . In October of\n          2000 she had some oral sounds but then subsequently regressed. There\n          has been some evidence of echolalia. Occasional stereotype movements\n          have been noted, especially when excited with some hand motions, and\n          she is noted to walk on her tip toes. At this time, she has been evaluated\n          in a hearing evaluation with an audiogram that was noted to be normal.\n          She has no history of seizures. There has been no evidence of\n          regression.\n          ...\n          Additional behavioral features reveal that [A.A.] frequently will stare at\n          lights, stares in the mirror and continues to twirl her hair. She does have\n          some interaction with those in the environment.\n\nId.\n\n       Her neurologic examination was generally within normal limits, but A.A. was non-\ncommunicative. 32 Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96. According to Dr. Lavenstein, A.A. was “a patient in\nwhom there may have been development of primitive speech then a regression of\nspeech, . . . a child who has autistic symptomatology.” Id. He recommended an\nadditional MRI scan and electroencephalogram [“EEG”] testing to determine whether\n\n\n\n32\n     Reflexes were normal, and she was not hypertonic.\n\n\n                                                    15\n\f“there are features that would be suggestive of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome.” Id., pp.\n96-97. 33\n\n       Following the neurologic consultation, A.A. underwent further diagnostic testing,\nincluding a cerebral MRI and an EEG, as well as blood plasma analysis to obtain amino\nacid levels. A radiological report dated October 3, 2001, indicated A.A.’s cerebral MRI\nresults were unremarkable. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 76. Similarly, an October 15, 2001, report\nindicated that her EEG results were within normal limits. Pet. Ex. 9, p.93. With regard\nto her amino acid levels, an October 22, 2001, laboratory report showed “mildly\nelevated” tyrosine and lysine, and “borderline high” branched-chain amino acids. The\nreport stated, however, that clinical correlation was required, and Dr. Lavenstein\nindicated they were reported as “non specific” by Dr. Mendel Tuchman, who interpreted\nthem. Pet. Exs. 10, p. 6; 9, p. 85.\n\n        On October 27, 2001, A.A. presented to Loudon Ear, Nose & Throat Specialists\nfor an evaluation of her recurrent episodes of otitis media. During the consultation,\nA.A.’s mother reported that “[o]ver the last 10 months, [A.A.] ha[d] had 4-5 acute [otitis\nmedia] episodes, . . . and, more importantly, ha[d] been diagnosed with speech delay.”\nPet. Ex. 9, p. 92. According to her mother, A.A.’s “regression began when the ear\ninfections started, and at least some of the developmental delay experts have indicated\nthat the fluid in her ear and/or recurrent acute infections could be at least part of the\nproblem.” Id. The physician examined A.A. and confirmed that she suffered from a\nspeech delay, “since at this age she still has very minimal vocabulary.” Id. She opined\nthat “her history of recurrent acute otitis media could be contributory since even\ntransient conductive hearing losses would affect her speech development at this age.”\nId. The physician recommended bilateral myringotomy and ventilation tube placement.\nId. The procedure was performed around October 2001. 34\n\n       A.A. was seen repeatedly over an approximately six week period, beginning in\nNovember 2001, for minor illnesses, which included pharyngitis and otitis media. See\nPet. Ex. 9, pp. 43, 45, 47, 49, 51. Reports of behavioral issues were mentioned during\nthese visits. Id.\n\n       On the morning of December 17, 2001, A.A. was taken to the Inova Fairfax\nHospital Emergency Department because of severe pain in her abdomen and groin\narea with recurrent bouts of uncontrollable crying and screaming, all of which had begun\napproximately one week earlier. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 10. After an initial examination, the\nemergency department physician rendered a tentative diagnosis of intermittent\nabdominal pain, rule out intussusception and UTI. Id. A barium enema and a kidney,\nureter, and bladder [“KUB”] workup were negative for intussusception, but notable for\n33\n  This evaluation also appears at Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 17-18. Duplicates of other exhibits also appear in\nA.A.’s primary care records. I will not identify duplicate citations.\n34\n  Medical records of the procedure were not filed; however, the surgery appears to have occurred around\nOctober 2001. See Pet. Ex. 9, p. 92 (Oct. 27, 2001 audiology consult recommending procedure “in the\nnear future”); Pet. Ex. 4, p. 28 (Dec. 17, 2001 medical history noting “PE tubes placed ~ 3 mo ago.”).\n\n\n                                                    16\n\fincreased stool in the colon, which “[t]he patient was not able to evacuate.” Id., pp. 40-\n41. The emergency department recommended that A.A. be admitted to the hospital for\nfurther testing and evaluation. Id., p. 34. A.A.’s pediatrician was informed of her status\nand of the available test results, including evidence of thrombocytosis and increased C-\nreactive proteins [“CRP”]. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 41. All other tests were negative, but an upper\ngastrointestinal [“UGI”] was still needed. Id.\n\n        At admission, A.A.’s mother completed a comprehensive pediatric history form\nregarding her health and development. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 56-58. She reported that A.A.\nwas generally healthy, but noted that she had recently been sick, had allergies to eggs\nand dairy, and was “slightly behind” in meeting developmental milestones. Id. She\nspecifically denied that A.A. had any history of gastrointestinal or genitourinary issues,\nor had any ear problems. Id. A.A.’s current medications were listed as Tylenol, smart\noil, good bacteria, and unidentified supplements. Id., p. 56.\n\n       Additional history was provided to the attending physician during the admitting\nexamination: A.A. was reportedly in her usual state of health following a flu-like illness\nwhen she developed increased fatigue, fussiness, and episodes of abdominal and\nperineal pain. Her symptoms were accompanied by extreme tantrums, during which\nshe placed her hands near her perineal/paravaginal area and screamed uncontrollably.\nThe episodes, which started about one week earlier, occurred several times per day\nand lasted for 20-30 minutes. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 28; see also id., p. 18 (pediatric history\ntaken by resident).\n\n        As for her earlier medical history, the attending physician recounted her burn\ninjury in January 2001 and a history of multiple ear infections requiring a myringotomy in\nOctober 2001. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 28; see also id., p. 18. The physician also noted that A.A.\nhad undergone an EEG and MRI in October 2001 with normal results “per Dr.\nLavenstein.” Id., p. 28. Concerning her development, the physician reported that A. A.\nhad a language delay and toe walked, but noted that she “runs [up and down] stairs,\nself feeds, [and] can speak in sentences, but talks little.” Id. Her speech reportedly had\nincreased after her myringotomy. Id. No history of behavioral problems was reported.\nId., p. 18. With regard to her diet, the physician noted that A.A.’s food allergies were\ndiscovered by way of a home ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] test\nadministered by her parents. Id., p. 28. A.A. was currently “followed by a nutritionist”\nand had a diet free of dairy and eggs and supplemented with vitamins. Id.\n\n      A.A. remained in the hospital overnight and was discharged on December 18,\n2001. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 7. A hospital pediatric consultation report dated that day\nsummarized the results of various tests undertaken during A.A.’s hospitalization. The\nconsulting physician stated:\n\n       [A.A.’s] work up so far has included a [KUB x-ray] which is notable for\n       increased stool in the colon as well as a normal barium enema and normal\n       pelvic ultrasound with Doppler. Of note, she does have thrombocytosis\n       with platelets of 947 and mildly elevated CRP of 1.32. Mild anemia with\n\n\n                                            17\n\f          hemoglobin of 11.2[,] but with normal electrolytes, liver function tests and\n          urinalysis. An electroencephalogram being done today . . . is pending. 35\n\nPet. Ex. 4, p. 21.\n\n        The consultant noted that A.A.’s physical examination was normal and stated\nthat “[a]t this point, it is unclear if her colicky pain is clearly gastrointestinal related or\nnot. It is possible that she may be having some post infection enteropathy which is\nworsened with her constipation.” Pet. Ex. 4, p. 21. He recommended an upper GI\nexamination to “rule out malrotation with intermittent volvulus and ischemia,” additional\nblood work, and continued Milk of Magnesia “to clean her out.” Id. The upper GI study\nperformed the following day, December 19, 2001, was negative for any abnormalities,\nincluding malrotation or duodenal obstruction. Id., p. 5.\n\n       On December 20, 2001, A.A was seen at Countryside for repeat blood testing.\nThe medical report noted that A.A. was feeling better. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 39. However, on\nDecember 31, 2001, A.A.’s mother telephoned Countryside seeking an appointment.\nShe reported that A.A. was “hysterical, upset since [2:30 a.m.], throwing things.” She\nstated that A.A. had been “evaluated at Fairfax Hospital [two] weeks [earlier] for these\nsame symptoms, EEG done, upper and lower GI, barium enema done, no cause was\nfound.” Id., p. 37. An appointment was scheduled for later that day. The corresponding\nmedical report noted that A.A.’s mother requested a toxicology workup for metals and\nexpressed concern about her decreased language ability. The possibility of autism was\nraised. Id., p. 36.\n\n       On January 3, 2002, A.A. was evaluated by a gastroenterologist for constipation.\nThe consultation report recounted that A.A. had recently been hospitalized “for extreme\nepisodes of rage/irritability.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 90. It noted that neurological evaluation was\nin progress “for possible developmental disorders.” Id. Abdominal x-rays taken during\nhospitalization “revealed large amount of retained stool” and the upper GI study was\nnormal. Id. The physician conducted a physical examination with normal findings. Id.\nA diagnosis of constipation was made. Id.\n\n       On January 14, 2002, A.A.’s parents telephoned Countryside to discuss her\nstatus. During the call, A.A.’s father stated “that he [was] 100% sure that [A.A.’s]\nproblems [we]re from her MMR immunization. 36 Her behavior started 30 days post\n\n35\n     The EEG results were normal. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 39.\n36\n   On January 28, 2002, Mrs. Allen was interviewed by a Loudon Public Schools social worker who was\npreparing a sociocultural assessment as part of A.A.’s application for special education services. During\nthe interview she reported that A.A.’s “development was fine until 10-23-00 when she had her MMR\nvaccination.” Pet. Ex. 8, p. 47. However, a few days later, on February 1, 2002, Mrs. Allen reported to a\nschool psychologist that A.A. “was very outgoing and her language skills were developing within normal\nlimits” until “[a]bout a year ago,” when her “speech skills began to regress and she began to struggle in\nsocial situations.” Pet. Ex. 8, p. 27. This time frame coincides with her three ear infections, which\noccurred in March and April 2001. See Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 8, 54-56.\n\n\n                                                       18\n\fMMR.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 35. He had been doing his own research on the Internet and had\nordered several dietary supplements, including pills to improve brain function and help\nthe body eliminate harmful metals. 37 Id. He also stated that they had seen a nutritionist\nnamed Kelly Dorfman who gave them “smart oil” to improve A.A.’s intelligence by 15\npercent. Id.\n\n       On January 14-15, 2002, Dr. Lavenstein administered a 24-hour DigiTrace EEG\nto record A.A.’s brain activity. The corresponding report noted that A.A. had “a history\nof seizures. First episode was December 2001 and last episode was [January 13,\n2002]. They seem to occur every day. Patient has a history of speech delay. These\n[seizures] appear to be temper tantrum-like events.” Pet. Ex. 10, p. 1. Doctor\nLavenstein stated that the EEG recorded several of these tantrum events, but “[a]t no\ntime was there any evidence of a[n] electrographic seizure correlate.” Id. The EEG\nrevealed “no premonitory electrographic discharge” or “evidence of any focal\nepileptiform disturbance.” Id. His impression was: “This 24 hour EEG correlating with\nany temper tantrums does not reveal any evidence of paroxysmal abnormality and is\nwithin normal limits.” Id.\n\n        In a letter dated February 2, 2002, Dr. Lavenstein provided his conclusions and\nrecommendations in light of the various tests performed to date. With regard to her\nsleep problems, he advised that A.A. undergo a polysomnogram for further sleep\nanalysis, as she had a sleep disorder. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 85. Concerning her developmental\ndelays and behavioral problems, Dr. Lavenstein raised concern “about the possibility of\nautism,” as there was “past development of primitive speech, then regression of speech\nin the setting of a positive family history of epilepsy in a child who does have autistic\nsymptomatology.” Id. Neurologic testing showed no evidence of Landau-Kleffner\nsyndrome, and an MRI scan was within normal limits. Id. Laboratory studies to date\nwere basically normal, including an amino acid screen. Id. Although there “were some\nborderline levels of tyrosine and lysine[, t]hese were felt to be nonspecific[.]” Id. Dr.\nLavenstein recommended that A.A. begin taking Klonopin to help her sleep. Id. He\nnoted that A.A. was to see Dr. Zimmerman in the near future. Id.\n\nF. Evaluations and Treatment at the Kennedy Krieger Children’s Hospital.\n\n       On February 13, 2002, A.A. was evaluated by Dr. Gerald Raymond at the\nNeurobehavioral Unit of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. Pet. Ex.\n6, p. 25. The initial evaluation report noted that A.A.’s parents were concerned about\nher “loss of language and social skills, and frequent temper tantrums.” 38 Id. According\nto her parents, A.A. “sat up independently at 6-months and walked by 12-months.” Id.\nAt the time of the evaluation, she was able to use a sippy cup, spoon, and a fork, “but\n\n37\n Mr. Allen specifically identified the following websites: www.life-enhancement.com;\nwww.extremehealth.com.\n38\n  Contemporaneous with the initial visit, A.A.’s parents completed a developmental and medical history\nform to provide background information for Dr. Raymond’s evaluation. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 39-44.\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fsometimes [ate] with her hands.” Id. She also assisted with dressing and undressing,\nbut was not toilet-trained. Id. The report continued:\n\n           Loss of language skills was noted at approximately 16-months. Prior to\n           that, she was reportedly able to make ‘animal sounds’ such as ‘roar!’ when\n           asked, and was able to state her age. Parents feel that loss of skills was\n           concomitant [sic] with her 15 month MMR vaccination. She has made\n           some improvements since that time and is now able to count some\n           objects. She occasionally uses words or phrases spontaneously, such as\n           “daddy go look.” She may say “French fries” when the family goes to\n           McDonald’s. She has made better eye contact recently, since starting\n           dietary supplements.\n\nId.\n\n       With regard to her previous medical history, Dr. Raymond noted the placement of\ntympanostomy tubes due to frequent otitis media, and recounted her normal\nneurological evaluation in September 2001, and hospitalization for severe temper\ntantrums in December 2001. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 25-26. He also noted that A.A. had been\ntaking a dietary supplement, “which include[d] chelation with EDTA,” for approximately\nthree weeks. 39 Id., p. 26. The supplement had reportedly improved her behaviors. Id.\nShe was also prescribed Klonopin. Id.\n\n       Following physical examination with normal results, Dr. Raymond assessed A.A.\nas “a 2-year, 6-month-old child who has had regression of language and social skills by\nparental report.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 27. He noted that her “[l]oss of language could be\nsuggestive of Landau-Kleffner’s syndrome; however, multiple EEG studies done in the\npast have been normal.” Id. Of specific concern were A.A.’s “poor pragmatic skills,\nlimited eye contact, and stereotypies. These features, with a history of regression, are\nsuggestive of autistic disorder. In her case, based on findings, Rett Syndrome should\nalso be considered.” Id. He recommended continued use of Klonopin to manage her\nbehaviors, but cautioned use of the dietary supplement. Id. He also recommended\nkaryotype, fragile X DNA, and Rett studies. 40 Id.\n\n       That same day, A.A. was seen by Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, a pediatric\nneurologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, for further evaluation of autistic symptoms.\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 23. Dr. Zimmerman’s report included the following history:\n\n           The parents report normal development until 11/00, when she underwent\n           regression 1-2 weeks following MMR immunization, with loss of language\n           and eye contact as well as social interaction. She is currently undergoing\n\n39\n     Testing of A.A.’s hair reportedly had revealed “high metal content and arsenic.” Pet. Ex. 8, p. 47.\n40\n  Fragile X genetic testing was normal. Pet. Exs. 6, p. 71; 15, p. 120. Rett syndrome genetic testing was\nnormal. Pet. Exs. 6, pp. 72-73; 15, pp.121-22. Both tests were performed on February 14, 2002.\n\n\n                                                       20\n\f      vitamin therapy and ‘GI support’, and has had trace metal testing of the\n      hair. She has been followed by Dr. Bennett Lavenstein and had normal\n      EEGs, including an overnight study, and cranial MRI scan. She has\n      shown increasing toe walking in recent months. Father feels her eye\n      contact is improving since starting ‘oral chelation’, which is obtained\n      through the mail. She uses up to 100 words inconsistently and tends to\n      lose single words that she has once used. She is now sleeping through\n      the night, though she has had episodes of awakenings every 2 hours, and\n      will have rage episodes with hitting her head and pulling her hair.\n\nId.\n\n       A.A. reportedly had exhibited “repetitive behaviors, hair-twirling and echolalia.”\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 23. Doctor Zimmerman assessed “her rating on the Childhood Autism\nRatings scale [as] 35-37, in the moderately autistic range.” Id. He noted that there was\nno family history of autism, and A.A. was an only child. Id. He conducted a physical\nexamination:\n\n      On exam, [A.A. was] fussy and reactive, does not engage or sustain eye\n      contact. Occasional word sounds [were] heard, as she responds to her\n      parents and seeks their attention briefly, and they are responsive to her. . .\n      . The cranium appears relatively small compared to the face, with large\n      features, and head circumference [in the] 50th percentile . . . . Tone is\n      moderate and symmetrical. She does not engage in a ball game, but\n      reaches into the can to obtain one. She climbs up and down a set of\n      steps repeatedly, has mild truncal instability but no tremor or movement\n      disorder. . . . Toe walking is persistent and increases with an instability of\n      her gait. The feet are plethoric in appearance (and are reported to change\n      color from pink to blue at times without apparent cause). Brief\n      hyperventilation episodes were reported on the exam earlier today.\n\nId.\n\n       Dr. Zimmerman concluded that A.A. “present[ed] an atypical history and\nappearance consistent with an encephalopathy and a pervasive development disorder\n(autism spectrum).” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24. Because of her “history of regressive\nencephalopathy,” he recommended genetic testing, as well as testing of quantitative\nplasma amino acids and urine organic acids. Id. He also recommended that she\ncontinue her treatment with Klonopin. Id.\n\n        On July 15, 2002, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up appointment.\nDuring the visit, A.A.’s mother reported that she had experienced “an increase in\nlanguage functions” due to her involvement in an infants and toddlers program, but had\n“lost some ground” after the program ended for the summer. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21. Doctor\nZimmerman noted that A.A. “ha[d] functional language, [but her] pragmatics [we]re still\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fpoor and she [did] not readily engage or relate.” Id. He planned to begin to taper her\nKlonopin dosage over the next few weeks. Id.; see also id., p. 88.\n\n       The report indicated that urinary organic acids had not been obtained, but that\n“[g]enetic testing was normal, including chromosomes and DNA for fragile X. Rett\nsyndrome genetic testing was normal. There is no family history of hearing loss or\nmuscle weakness (mitochondrial disorder).” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21. With regard to behavior,\nDr. Zimmerman reported that “[s]he marche[d] around the room and [was] continuously\nactive. She jump[ed] and ha[d] some hand flapping with excitement.” Id. He stated\nthat they again “reviewed the history of her loss of functions following MMR vaccine.\nShe has regressive encephalopathy with development of PDD (autism spectrum\ndisorder).” Id. He recommended that she have Applied Behavior Analysis [“ABA”]\ntherapy. 41 Id.\n\n       In addition to ABA therapy, Dr. Zimmerman recommended additional testing,\nincluding “quantitative urinary organic acids, fasting serum lactic acid, serum\nchemistries with liver function tests (especially AST), as well as CK (CPK),” 42 in view of\nthe possibility of mitochondrial disorder. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21. He stated “[m]itochondrial\ndisorders are difficult to diagnose, and some of them are responsive to specific vitamin\ntherapies.” Id. He noted at the conclusion of his report that A.A. “had normal\nquantitative amino acids, including the alanine/lysine ratio.” Id.\n\n        On November 4, 2002, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. A\nnursing report noted that A.A. was non-compliant and crying during intake procedures.\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 86. It also noted that she was being treated with vitamin therapy. Id.\nDuring the examination, A.A.’s mother reported increased sensory sensitivities and\nagitation since she stopped taking Klonopin. Pet. Exs. 6, p.19. But she noted that A.A.\nwas “showing more responsiveness in her therapies and [was] using a few words.” Id.\n\n        With regard to test results, Dr. Zimmerman noted that\n\n        [l]aboratory testing again showed a normal amino acid profile. Her plasma\n        lactate was 2.2 mM/L (0.7-2.1) and CPK was 196 IU/L (0-165) . . . and\n        calcium 10.6 (8.5-10.4). She was struggling when the test was done and,\n        by report, the tourniquet was not removed.

Ex. 6, p.19.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman prescribed carnitine and folic acid and ordered a follow-up in\nthree months. The discharge diagnosis was “encephalopathy.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 85.\n\n       On November 15, 2002, A.A. was seen at Countryside due to a reported seizure\nthat morning. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 2. The medical record reflects that A.A. had a “grand mal”\nseizure, which lasted approximately three minutes. Id. She was taken to Countryside\non the advice of Dr. Zimmerman. Id. Physical examination was normal. Id. A.A.’s new\n“vitamin therapy” was mentioned. Id., p. 24. On November 23, 2002, A.A. was treated\nfor pharyngitis and viral infection. Id., p. 23. She reportedly “missed school all week.”\nId.\n\n       On January 13, 2003, A.A. had another EEG, the results of which indicated “a\nfocal cerebral disturbance of the right temporal region, but possibly involving the right\ncerebral hemisphere diffusely.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 54. The reporting physician noted “no\nclear epileptiform discharges,” but could “not rule out an epileptic disorder.” Id. He\nrecommended an imaging study be performed “to evaluate for structural abnormalities.”\nId.\n\n       A.A. was seen at Countryside on January 21, 2003, due to another reported\ngrand mal seizure that morning, which lasted about two minutes. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 22. The\nmedical report noted that she was scheduled to see Dr. Zimmerman the following day,\nbut that he wanted her to be seen at Countryside “because she ha[d] had 4 seizures\nsince [the] new year.” Id. Physical examination was normal, with the exception of an\ninflamed right tympanic membrane, diagnosed as acute OM. Id.\n\n        On January 22, 2003, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. Dr.\nZimmerman discussed A.A.’s most recent EEG results and noted that she had had four\n“generalized tonic-clonic seizures, apparently nonfocal, over the past several weeks\nafter starting a trial of Carnitor (L-carnitine), [which] was discontinued about 3 weeks\nago.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15. Although her last seizure occurred the previous day and she\nwas presently alert, her mother observed “intermittent episodes of convergence spasm\n\n43\n  The report from the repeat testing noted these results as “CK = 201 IU/L (24-170); Calcium 10.7 [8.5-\n10.4]; AST 44 U/L (0-31); CO2=19; carnitine profile normal; organic acids – normal.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19;\nsee also Pet. Exs. 6, p. 56 (Johns Hopkins lab report dated Nov. 4, 2002); 6, p. 57 (KKI genetics lab\nreport dated Nov. 7, 2002); 6, p. 58 (KKI mass spectrometry lab report dated Nov. 8, 2002).\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fof the eyes” during the “past week or so.” Id. A.A.’s speech, however, had reportedly\nimproved while taking Carnitor. Id.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman noted a limited familial history of seizures, but stated that\nA.A.’s MRI films from October 2001 appeared normal, “showing no focal abnormalities\non the right side.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15. He recounted that she had “a history of normal\ndevelopment until about 2 weeks after her MMR immunization at 18 [sic] months of age.\nUp to that time, she knew her colors and was using words and was pointing. She\nbegan repetitive behaviors and declined in her speech production with her regression.”\nId. The seizures, however, were “a new onset.” Id. This history is significantly different\nfrom the medical records showing A.A.’s skill level at the time of vaccination and from\nthe histories provided before her parents asserted that the MMR vaccine was causal.\nSee, e.g., Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10 (pediatrician assessment at one-year checkup indicating\nA.A. knew one to three words); Pet. Ex. 5, p. 4 (parental report to speech-language\npathologist on September 5, 2001, stating that A.A. spoke “her first word ‘Quack’ at 1\nyear and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months”), p. 5 (she “stopped\nspeaking after having 3 ear infections in a row”); Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96 (parental report to Dr.\nLavenstein on September 6, 2001, that at 15 months A.A. “had some oral sounds”; Dr.\nLavenstein’s characterization of her speech at that time as “primitive”).\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman planned a repeat EEG in six weeks, after starting A.A. on\nDepakote. “Depending on the results of her repeat EEG . . . we may wish to repeat her\nMRI scan, if right sided or other focal abnormalities persist.” Pet. Ex. 6, p.15. He also\nrecommended updated bloodwork for “CBC, AST and a valproic acid level.” Id. Any\ndecision “to reinstitute treatment with carnitine and other ‘mitochondrial vitamins’” would\nbe determined at a later date. Id. Dr. Zimmerman prescribed Depakote and ordered a\nfollow-up in six weeks. Id. The discharge diagnosis was, again, encephalopathy. Id.,\np. 82.\n\n       Another EEG was performed on March 3, 2003, pursuant to Dr. Zimmerman’s\norder. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 50. The record reflected “no seizure discharges or localizing signs”\nand was improved as compared to the one obtained on January 13, 2003. Id. The\nexaminer also noted that “[t]he focal attenuation of activity noticed over the right side on\nthe previous recording was not present in the current record; however, it must be kept in\nmind that there were fewer recording channels in the current record.” Id.\n\n       That same day, A.A. was also seen by Dr. Zimmerman. He noted that A.A. was\ncurrently taking Depakote and had only “a single seizure [the previous] week after sleep\ndeprivation and none ha[d] recurred.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 13. He also reported that “[s]everal\nstudies suggest[ed] that [A.A.] has signs of a mitochondrial disorder.” Id. As a result,\nhe contacted Dr. Richard Kelley and asked him to review A.A.’s chart. Id. He intended\nto ask Dr. Kelley to see A.A. clinically “to review studies[,] comment on any further\ntesting[,] . . . [and] recommend treatment.” Id. In the meantime, Dr. Zimmerman started\nA.A. on coenzyme Q, folic acid, and thiamine; however, restarting Carnitor would be\npostponed “pending Dr. Kelley’s recommendation.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f         On April 8, 2003, A.A. was seen by Dr. Richard Kelley, a metabolic specialist at\nthe Kennedy Krieger Institute, for further evaluation and recommendations for\ntreatment. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 3. In his report, Dr. Kelley recounted A.A.’s relevant history, as\nprovided by her parents and medical records. Id. Consistent with previous accounts,\nA.A. reportedly “did well in the neonatal period and appeared to be a healthy, thriving\ngirl for the remainder of the first year.” Id. “[L]anguage acquisition continued to develop\nnormally up until the age of 15 months when, approximately one to two weeks after her\nMMR immunization, [A.A.] progressively lost most of her language, visual contact, and\nnormal social interaction over several weeks.” Id. Extensive testing and evaluation “to\ndetermine the cause of the losses [provided] no explanation for her autistic regression.”\nId. Then, in February 2002, A.A. was seen by Dr. Zimmerman. Although she had\nregained some of her language, “and to some degree, her socialization” by the time of\nthe evaluation, “she continued to have major behavioral problems, including self-injury.”\nId. At that examination, she demonstrated “persistent toe-walking as well as some gait\ninstability, suggesting . . . a primary neurological disorder and not idiopathic autistic\nspectrum disorder.” Id.\n\n       In view of the “early regressive nature of [A.A.’s] pervasive developmental\ndisorder and the abnormalities in [her] neurological examination, Dr. Zimmerman was\nconcerned that [she] might have a metabolic disease or other genetic disorder causing\nher progressive developmental and neurological losses.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 3. He “obtained\na number of basic laboratory studies for diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism.” 44 Id.\n\n          These showed several abnormalities, including an increased plasma\n          alanine level, increased ratio of AST to ALT, mildly increased creatine\n          kinase level, mildly increased blood lactate level, and electrolyte evidence\n          of a mild metabolic acidosis. Negative diagnostic testing for identifiable\n          causes of autistic spectrum disorder included Fragile X testing, Rett\n          syndrome mutation analysis, plasma carnitine profile, and urinary organic\n          acid analysis. Taken together, the laboratory abnormalities suggested an\n          inborn error of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Interesting with regard\n          to [A.A.’s] having a possible mitochondrial disorder is that, although frank\n          hypoglycemia has never been documented, [A.A.] seems to [be] very\n          sensitive to fasting and, according her parents, ‘melts’ if she misses a\n          between-meal snack. She also sometimes becomes ‘stuporous’ within 15\n          to 20 minutes of a meal and often wants to eat in the middle of the night.\n\nId.\n\n      In view of the “biochemical evidence for a mitochondrial disorder . . ., and\nbecause of success in treating similar children with pharmacological amounts of\nmitochondrial cofactors,” Dr. Zimmerman had started A.A. on “stepwise\nsupplementation with carnitine, thiamine, and folic acid[.]” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 4. A.A.\nbecame “very excitable and agitated on carnitine,” however, and also experienced\n\n44\n     The report summarized the results of the diagnostic testing undertaken to date. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 4-5.\n\n\n                                                      25\n\fseveral grand mal seizures. Id. Treatment with carnitine was discontinued and an\nanticonvulsant was prescribed. Id. With regard to the effectiveness of carnitine, Dr.\nKelley noted:\n\n      Although there was suspicion that the seizures had been brought on by\n      treatment with carnitine, [A.A.’s] last seizure prior to initiation of\n      anticonvulsive therapy occurred three weeks after stopping carnitine.\n      After starting treatment with Depakote, [A.A.] . . . had no further seizures.\n      However, [she] remains significantly more excitable and agitated than\n      prior to initiation of any of these medications and supplements. As a\n      result, [A.A.’s] parents suspect that some of [her] worsening behavior has\n      been caused by Depakote. Also important is that [A.A] was noted to be\n      much more alert and focused in school after starting treatment with\n      carnitine, an observation that was made by teachers who at the time were\n      unaware of [her] new medication.\n\nId.\n\n        Doctor Kelley noted that A.A. did not have a history of any significant illness or\nhospitalizations. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 4. It is not clear whether Dr. Kelley was unaware of her\nprevious hospitalization for tantrums and constipation in December 2001, or whether he\ndid not consider this event significant. He stated that “[a]part from the above history,\n[A.A. showed] no signs or symptoms of a metabolic disease such as food intolerance,\nchronic vomiting or diarrhea, recurrent infections, abnormal rashes, unusual odors, or\ndecompensation with otherwise simple childhood infections (apart from the MMR\nimmunization).” Id. He noted, however, that she “may have had more than the usual\nnumber of ear infections and has required frequent treatment with antibiotics as well as\nbilateral tympanostomy.” Id. A complete physical examination was not undertaken, as\nthe “visit was primarily for consultation regarding pharmacological treatment.” Id., p. 5.\n\n      In his assessment, Dr. Kelley explained:\n\n      Although autism in most children remains a diagnosis without known\n      cause, [A.A.] . . . has many of the historical and laboratory characteristics\n      that we now associate with a particular form of autistic spectrum disorder\n      caused by an inborn error of mitochondrial metabolism. Children with this\n      disorder (possibly a group of disorders), typically appear to be normal for\n      their first 12 months or more before a viral illness or other stress[,] such as\n      an immunization[,] provides the critical metabolic stress that sufficiently\n      taxes or compromises energy metabolism in the brain to precipitate acute\n      or subacute cognitive and motor deterioration. For reasons that most\n      likely are explained by changes in neurotransmitter receptor densities in\n      the brain, the period between 12 and 36 months is the time when children\n      with these mitochondrial disturbances appear to be most susceptible to\n      brain injury. Such injury may occur once or several times with additional\n      stresses, or, more rarely, a child may regress for many months, even in\n\n\n                                            26\n\f          the absence of specific stresses like infections or immunizations. Most\n          likely because the greatest susceptibility for brain [sic] occurs during a\n          peak period of language and social development, children who sustain this\n          type of mitochondrial injury often develop signs of autistic spectrum\n          disorder.\n\nId.\n\n          He then stated:\n\n          In addition to historical information consistent with an inborn error of\n          energy metabolism, [A.A.’s] laboratory studies are similar to those of other\n          children with autistic spectrum disorders and mitochondrial disease, which\n          for shorthand we call ‘mitochondrial PDD.’ These include a distinctly\n          increased level of plasma alanine relative to essential amino acids, a high\n          ratio of AST to ALT, mildly increased creatine kinase level, and mild\n          metabolic acidosis. Although [A.A.’s] plasma lactate level was only\n          borderline increased at 2.2 mM, the lack of a distinct lactic acidosis in\n          children with mitochondrial PDD together with an increased alanine level\n          is quite characteristic. This is also consistent with muscle biopsy studies\n          in mitochondrial PDD children, which typically show a significant block at\n          the level of complex I, the primary site of oxidation of pyruvate. Alanine,\n          being the amino acid form of pyruvate, is secondarily increased, but more\n          useful as a diagnostic marker because its degree of elevation can be\n          expressed relative to other amino acids, and it is not subject to artifacts\n          commonly encountered in doing pyruvate and lactate measurements. The\n          mildly increased levels of AST and creatine kinase are presumed to reflect\n          the involvement of muscle tissue, which, second only to the brain, has the\n          highest demand for mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n\nId., pp. 5-6.\n\n        Doctor Kelley also discussed A.A.’s “hyperactivity reaction” to carnitine, which he\nexplained was “not uncommon in mitochondrial PDD.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 6. With regard to\nher first seizure, he found it unlikely, “based on extensive international experience with\ncarnitine treatment of metabolic disorders, that carnitine could be the primary cause of a\nseizure disorder, only the particular factor that demonstrates a child’s predisposition to\nhaving seizures. Indeed, seizures are relatively common in mitochondrial PDD before\nany pharmacological treatments are begun.” Id. Despite A.A.’s reaction, Dr. Kelley\nbelieved carnitine was beneficial and recommended A.A. restart the treatment. Id. In\naddition, he recommended “starting the combination of vitamins now commonly used in\nthe treatment of mitochondrial diseases.” 45 Id. The vitamin therapy was planned to\ncontinue “until at least age five years. Id. In the meantime, Dr. Kelley encouraged A.A.\nto “continue to be followed by Dr. Zimmerman and her developmental specialists to\nmonitor her progress.” Id. Although he found it unnecessary that she return for\n45\n     The vitamin mixture was coenzyme Q10, vitamins C and E, thiamine, and lipoic acid. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 7.\n\n                                                     27\n\f“continued formal evaluation” at his clinic, he offered to provide advice or consultation\nas necessary regarding adjustments to her medications. Id., p. 7.\n\n       Finally, Dr. Kelley noted that although “the specific genetic lesion or lesions\ncausing mitochondrial PDD” are not known, mitochondrial enzymatic analysis of muscle\nbiopsies from “several similar children” have “almost always [shown] exactly the same\nbiochemical profile.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 7. As a result, “undertaking an invasive and\nexpensive muscle biopsy at this time would not seem to have any practical value.” Id.\n\n       On July 14, 2003, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. He noted\nthat she had been doing “remarkably well on the mitochondrial regimen” and provided a\nfavorable evaluation. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 1. He reported:\n\n       Today her eye contact is notably improved and she sustains it for several\n       seconds and is briefly interactive. She plays with imagination with a toy\n       stove and stays busy with it. She is heard to sing words clearly and is\n       using single words and word combinations. Her sleep has improved,\n       although she is up about once per week during the night and is ‘wired’ for\n       a few hours. This is gradually improving. She has remained seizure free\n       on Tegretol . . . . She still is having difficulty with transitions and sensory\n       sensitivities. Her growth has improved with increase in weight . . . from\n       60th to 95th percentile, and height . . . represents increase from 50th to\n       75th percentile in the last four months.\n\nId.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman noted that A.A.’s positive response to the mitochondrial\nregimen indicated a possible “underlying mitochondrial dysfunction which may be from a\nnuclear gene that affects the mitochondria.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 1. He ordered bloodwork and\na follow-up in three months. Id.; id, p. 76; see also Pet. Ex. 15, pp. 98-99 (laboratory\nresults).\n\n       On July 14, 2003, Dr. Kelly provided a letter excusing A.A. from further\nvaccination due to her condition. The letter stated that A.A. “has autistic spectrum\ndisorder and biochemical evidence of a mitochondrial disease.” It explained that “the\nphysiological stress of a vaccine” can trigger the “onset of brain injury in children with\nmitochondrial disease . . . as was the case for [A.A.] at the time of her MMR\nimmunization.” For this reason, it was recommended that A.A. not receive any further\nMMR or cellular pertussis vaccines until she passed “the window of greatest\nvulnerability for brain injury,” which in children with A.A.’s “type of metabolic disorder” is\nsix years of age. Pet. Ex. 11, p. 162.\n\n       On October 27, 2003, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. The\nmedical report reflected that A.A. “seem[ed] to be doing quite well on the mitochondrial\nvitamin supplements.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 160. She had been seizure free since January\n2003, and the plan was to taper her off the anticonvulsant once she reached the two-\n\n\n                                              28\n\fyear point. Id. Laboratory results were generally within normal limits, including a\ncomprehensive metabolic panel. Id.; see also Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 52-53.\n\n       On March 15, 2004, A.A. presented for a routine neurology follow-up with Dr.\nZimmerman. According to her parents, A.A. had recently experienced a “regression” in\nher behaviors and skills. Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 155-56. She was having increased sensory\nintegration problems, including frequent temper tantrums, and appeared less happy\nthan usual. Id. Additionally, certain behaviors had returned or increased, including\nteeth grinding, stereotypic behaviors, humming, and toe walking. Id., p. 155. It had also\nbecome harder for her to transition to new situations and she was observed by her\nparents and teachers to be “more lethargic” and “less focused in the afternoon.” Id., pp.\n155-56. Of particular concern was a teacher report that A.A. had recently had a brief\nstaring spell and “did not respond for a short time.” Id., p. 155. Her father also reported\nobserving a possible seizure-like episode, but was not certain. Id. Although A.A.\n“continue[d] to speak occasionally” and “respond to specific choices given to her, [she\ndid] not make spontaneous speech.” Id. She was “learning things,” but her parents\nwere considering her placement in “a special education kindergarten program where\nshe w[ould] be pulled into regular programs in school.” Id., p. 156. It was noted that\nA.A. “ha[d] been on the mitochondrial vitamins for one year . . . with no change in the\ndosage.” Id., p. 155.\n\n        The impression was that A.A. had undergone a regression in her behaviors and\nskills. Pet. Ex. 11, p. 156. The plan was to slowly increase her mitochondrial vitamins\nto their target dosage. Id. The possible staring spells were “concerning,” so the plan\nwas to increase her anticonvulsant medication. Id., p. 157. A follow-up was scheduled\nin three months. Id. Subsequent laboratory results were generally within normal limits,\nwith the exception of creatine, AST, and her platelet count. Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 48-49. Her\nplasma carnitine was within normal limits. Pet. Ex. 12, p. 50.\n\n       On June 14, 2004, A.A. returned for a neurology follow-up with Dr. Zimmerman.\nThe medical report reflected that A.A. had improved since the previous visit and\n“continued to do quite well on the mitochondrial vitamins.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 148. She was\nkept at her current levels, with no intention of ending the treatment “anytime soon, since\nthey seem to be working very effectively.” Id. Because she had been seizure-free for a\nyear and a half, they planned to begin tapering her anticonvulsant medications. Id.\n\n        By December 2005, A.A. was off her anticonvulsant medication and doing well.\nPet. Ex. 11, p. 135-36. In December 2008, Dr. Zimmerman planned to taper A.A. off of\nthe vitamin cocktail to determine whether there was “still indication of mitochondrial\ndysfunction.” Pet. Ex. 12, p. 1. Although it is not clear from the record whether this\noccurred, Dr. Zimmerman later wrote, in a June 21, 2010 evaluation, that A.A. continued\nto have “clinical suggestion of mitochondrial dysfunction.”46 Pet. Ex. 15, p. 1. As of the\n\n46\n  In his evaluation, Dr. Zimmerman noted: “When she was off all mitochondrial vitamins she seemed to\nregress and Father has noted that she improves after each morning dose of Carnitor[.] . . . Mother is not\nsure whether there is benefit from it, but agrees to continue with the treatment.” Pet. Ex. 15, p. 1.\n\n\n                                                    29\n\fmost current record, A.A. continued to take Carnitor and the mitochondrial cocktail. Pet.\nEx. 64, pp. 1-2.\n\n       Petitioners submitted medical records dated through April 2012, at which time\nA.A. was 12 years old. The records reflected regular treatment with her pediatrician 47\nand ongoing care with Dr. Zimmerman and others at KKI. Pet. Exs. 61, pp. 16, 18-20,\n23-28, 30-31, 33-34 (Countryside Pediatrics); 15, pp. 1, 49-52 (KKI); 64, pp. 1-2 ( KKI).\n\n                  IV. Summary of Fact Testimony and Supporting Evidence.\n\n       At the July 10, 2013 hearing, A.A.’s father, James Allen, and her maternal aunt,\nSusan Edick, testified with regard to A.A.’s health and development prior to her October\n23, 2000 MMR vaccination, and the changes they observed over the ensuing months.\nMr. Allen and Ms. Edick provided additional evidence in the form of written affidavits.\nSee Pet. Exs. 78, 79. Video and photographic evidence was also submitted. See Pet.\nExs. 60, 75, 80, 81 (video); 76 (photos); Trial Exs. 1-3 (photos).\n\nA. Mr. James Allen.\n\n       Mr. Allen testified that A.A. had a “healthy” birth and was regularly evaluated by\nher pediatrician, who expressed no concerns during her first year of development.\nNeither of A.A.’s parents had any concerns about her development either. Tr. at 6-7;\nPet. Ex. 78 at 2.\n\n        A.A. reached a notable milestone just prior to her first birthday, when she took\nher first steps during a family vacation to the Outer Banks over the 4th of July holiday.\nTr. at 7-8; Pet. Ex. 78 at 2. A photograph taken during the trip showed A.A. standing on\nthe beach, smiling and playfully tugging on a rope attached to a boogie board. 48 Mr.\nAllen recalled that A.A. was happy on the trip, laughing and giggling. Tr. at 8; Pet. Ex.\n78 at 2. He noted that “[o]nce she started walking, it wasn’t long before she was\nrunning, too.” Tr. at 8.\n\n       Early on, she also developed “a strong liking [for] the water” and enjoyed going to\nthe swimming pool. Tr. at 9. Mr. Allen stated that they frequently took A.A. to a local\nswimming pool where she “would go in the wading pool and splash with other children.”\nPet. Ex. 78 at 3. One of her favorite places, though, was a large waterpark near their\nhome. Tr. at 9; Pet. Ex. 78 at 3. He recalled that whenever A.A. visited the park, she\nwas actively engaged with her surroundings—running, splashing, and playing with other\nchildren. Tr. at 9; Pet. Ex. 78 at 3. Her affinity for water was reportedly illustrated by a\nphoto of A.A. with her mother in a pool. 49 The photo, which showed A.A. “kind of doing\n47\n     A.A. continued to suffer from recurrent OM.\n48\n     A photograph of the trip to the Outer Banks was used as Pet. Trial Ex. 1.\n49\n  A photograph of her swimming with her mother was used as Pet. Trial Ex. 3. Mr. Allen noted that A.A.\nwas looking directly at the camera in the photograph. Tr. at 17.\n\n\n                                                      30\n\fthe doggie paddle thing,” was taken during “the summer of 2000, around her birthday.”\nTr. at 17.\n\n       With regard to her personality, A.A. was becoming “kind of a jokester.” Tr. at 9.\nFor example, when asked “how big” she was, A.A. would “smile, extend her arms and\nsay ‘Soooo big’ and wait for everyone to laugh.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 4; see also Tr. at 9-10.\nShe could tell “knock-knock” jokes, too, although she “hadn’t quite learned to hold back\nher laughter until the punch line[.]”50 Pet. Ex. 78 at 3-4; see also Tr. at 10. She also\nloved animals and often played with the family’s dogs. Tr. at 10; Pet. Ex. 78 at 5.\n\n        Mr. Allen testified that members of both sides of the family observed A.A. during\nher first year, and none expressed concern or reported any strange behaviors. Tr. at\n11-12. Indeed, she “was actually accelerating, growing.” Tr. at 12. According to Mr.\nAllen, she played well with other children, had no difficulty with eye contact, and\nresponded when called to by name. Tr. at 10-12. She was “very social.” Tr. at 11. In\nfact, by her first birthday, A.A. reportedly had learned to use “well over 100 words.” Tr.\nat 70-72. In view of the other evidence regarding A.A.’s language at one year of age,\nthis testimony cannot be accurate.\n\n       On her first birthday (July 21, 2000), A.A.’s parents threw a small party attended\nby family and friends. Tr. at 12-13. A photograph taken that day shows A.A. next to her\nbirthday cake. 51\n\n       In the fall of that year, over the Labor Day holiday, petitioners visited A.A.’s\nmaternal aunt and family [“the Edicks”] at their home in Syracuse, New York. Pet. Ex.\n78 at 3. Mr. Allen described A.A. as active during their stay and specifically recalled her\nplaying croquet with him and several of her cousins in the backyard. Id. at 4. Although\n“she could only hit the ball about three feet, . . . she tried. She knew how to play. She\nunderstood the colors.” Tr. at 33; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 4. One of his memories was\nof her “saying she was ‘a big girl’ while holding the croquet mallet and trying to hit the\nball.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 4. A photograph taken that weekend 52 showed A.A. outside during\na game of croquet, standing independently with a ball in her hands.\n\n       On October 14, 2000, the family visited a local pumpkin patch to purchase a few\npumpkins. Mr. Allen recalled that A.A. was full of energy that day and enjoyed the\nexperience. He specifically remembered her playing on playground equipment and\n\n50\n  This statement is simply not credible. At one year of age, A.A.’s pediatrician assessed her with having\none to three words, which was considered to be normal development. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10. Two to three\nword sentences were not expected until age two years. See Pet. Ex. 9, p. 4. Indeed, petitioners\nthemselves reported that A.A. spoke her first word “quack” at one year and spoke “a little more/using\nanimal sounds” at 15 months. See Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5.\n51\n     A photograph on her first birthday was used as Pet. Trial Ex. 2.\n52\n  Pet. Ex. 76; see Tr. at 115 (Ms. Susan Edick testified that she took the photograph on September 3,\n2000).\n\n\n                                                       31\n\fhelping to choose the pumpkins. Tr. at 19-20. “She was like a kid in a candy store,\nbasically.” Tr. at 21. Video from that day showed A.A. walking and touching the\npumpkins. 53 In one segment, she was seen “pushing” a wheelbarrow while holding her\nmother’s hand. Tr. at 20. Mr. Allen also thought she might have danced to some music\nplaying in the background. Tr. at 21. His recollection from that activity was of A.A.\n“engaging with people, . . . with her mom and her dad, too.” Tr. at 22.\n\n        Mr. Allen also videotaped A.A. at home on that same day in various situations—\nfrom running around the house to eating dinner. 54 In one clip, A.A. was standing in her\ncrib looking at the camera. Mr. Allen described her as “a little grumpy” after having just\nawakened from a nap. Tr. at 15. In another, she was in the bathtub splashing and\nplaying with some toys. Mr. Allen noted that she made eye contact and was “very\ninteractive.” Id. During her bath, A.A. was playing with a rubber ducky and splashed\nherself with water, “which she liked to do.” Id. He recalled her saying “quack, quack”\nwhen asked what sound a duck makes, although the sound does not appear on the\nvideos. Tr. at 15-17. She “loved to make animal sounds,” but her “first words were da-\nda.” Tr. at 15. 55\n\n        After her bath, A.A. was videotaped playfully running around her parents’\nbedroom. See Pet. Ex. 60. When asked if she was vocalizing during the clip, Mr. Allen\nresponded: “Yes. A little bit. Really she was kind of doing the quack-quack still after\nthe bath, yeah.” Tr. at 18. In a subsequent segment, she was engaged in a “game”\nwith her father that involved her being chased “down the main hallway on the second\nfloor.” Tr. at 25. “That was a tickler bug thing . . . you know ‘I’m going to get you[.]’”\nTr. at 25. In the clip she also kissed her favorite stuffed toy—a teddy bear. Tr. at 26. In\nanother scene, A.A. danced to a song playing on Sesame Street. Tr. at 28- 29. A later\nclip showed her seated in a high chair eating dinner. At the end of that clip she\nappeared to imitate her father. He explained: “I was doing the ‘rah’ and she was doing it\nback.” Tr. at 29.\n\n       On October 23, 2000, A.A. received a MMR vaccination. Although Mr. Allen was\npresent at the appointment, he could not recall any details. Tr. at 102-04. He did,\nhowever, remember noticing changes in her behavior following the appointment, but not\nnecessarily on that day. Tr. at 73. He specifically recollected a developing awareness\nthat something was wrong during a neighborhood Halloween party the family attended\non October 29, 2000. Tr. at 77. The daytime, outdoor event included treats, games,\nand a participatory parade for the children to show off their costumes. Tr. at 30-31; Pet.\n\n53\n     Video of A.A. on October 14, 2000. Pet.

Despite confessing his love for recording his\ndaughter’s life (Tr. at 14.), Mr. Allen was able to find video from only three events of her entire childhood.\nIn view of his comments, I find the lack of other videos from holidays or birthdays in this period\ninexplicable and concerning for spoliation of evidence.\n55\n  This statement is contrary to earlier reports. See, e.g., Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5 (reporting that her first word was\n“quack”).\n\n\n                                                       32\n\fEx. 78 at 4-5. She did not want to walk in the parade and displayed little interest in\ninteracting with other children or participating in the activities. Tr. at 31; Pet. Ex. 78 at 4-\n5. She really “seemed inattentive and passive.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 5. She “just stood in one\nplace like a mannequin”—she “looked stoned.” Tr. at 31. While there were “brief\nmoments” when she “would take one step, two steps here, one or two steps [t]here,”\nshe did not really walk, and definitely did not run. Tr. at 36-37.\n\n      Mr. Allen contrasted this behavior with her actions over the Labor Day weekend,\nwhen she eagerly played croquet in her aunt’s backyard. Tr. at 32-33. On that\noccasion, she was “interacting and playing games”—she wanted “to be like a big girl,” to\nunderstand the rules and learn how to play. Tr. at 32-33. At the Halloween party,\nhowever, she did not play games, or want to walk, stand, or interact with the other kids.\nHe recalled thinking that “maybe she’s really shy or something.”\n\n       In video taken during the neighborhood Halloween party, A.A. was seen standing\nwith other children waiting for family and friends to take photographs of the group. 56 Tr.\nat 35. Mr. Allen recalled that afterwards A.A. just stood in place until every other child\nhad left. Id. He thought she would want to follow them for the parade, but she did not.\nId. Rather than walk, she allowed her mother to carry her for a while and then push her\nin a cart. Id. Mr. Allen observed the absence of eye contact or any sounds during the\nsegment and noted that when they spoke to her, she showed no response. Tr. at 35-\n36. “You can hear the birds, but you don’t hear her.” Tr. at 36.\n\n       Her disinterest “was kind of startling” to him—“[i]t was a big change.” Tr. at 37.\nIn the past, she would have had “her hands in everything.” Tr. at 38. But on that day\nshe was not engaged. Id. As an example, he remembered that they tried without\nsuccess to get her to play a beanbag toss game. Id. They “had to walk it up . . . and\nshe’d put it through the hole and that was it.” Id. The other children “sort of ran by her.”\nId. He remembered thinking “maybe she’s got a bug or something or maybe she’s just\nhaving a bad day.” Id.\n\n       According to Mr. Allen, that day (October 29, 2000) marked the beginning of\nnoticeable changes in A.A.’s behavior. Tr. at 38. From there she gradually stopped\nspeaking and interacting, and her personality changed. Id.\n\n       That night, when she developed a fever and refused to eat, petitioners became\nconcerned. Tr. at 78. Because her fever was over 100 degrees, they contacted A.A.’s\ndoctor, who told them to administer Tylenol and to call back or come in if the fever did\nnot subside. Tr. at 78-79. There is no record of this telephone call. The fever lasted\nfour days, during which it “kind of spiked and . . . went down and spiked again.” Tr. at\n39-40. As a result of her illness, A.A. was unable to trick-or-treat on Halloween night.\nId.; see also Tr. at 79-80 (testified that they contacted doctor twice); Pet. Ex. 78 at 5.\nThey did not take her to the doctor. Tr. at 80-81.\n\n\n\n56\n     Video of A.A. on October 29, 2000. See Pet. Ex. 80, 81.\n\n                                                     33\n\f        Mr. Allen stated that he and A.A.’s mother speculated as to the cause of the\nillness, but remained uncertain. Initially, they wondered if it was something she had\neaten—perhaps too much candy or she had developed an allergy. Tr. at 40-41. They\nalso considered that it was a “’bug,’ like the flu[,]” or that she was maybe teething. As a\nnew parent, the situation “was disconcerting.” Tr. at 41; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 5.\nHowever, this was not A.A.’s first illness.\n\n       According to Mr. Allen, A.A.’s behavior changed significantly after the fever. He\nstated that she was sleepy, cried at night, and wanted to go to bed early. Tr. at 81. She\nno longer was “talkative” and would not respond or make eye contact. Tr. at 41. She\nalso stopped “watching Sesame Street and dancing.” Id. Instead, she would sit on the\ncarpet and pull pieces of thread. Id. She “wasn’t mobile like other kids.” Id. He could\nnot recall, though, whether he or his wife contacted A.A.’s physician about her\nworsening symptoms. Tr. at 81-82; see also Tr. at 45.\n\n        Over the Veterans Day weekend in November 2000, the Edicks visited\npetitioners at their home in Virginia. Tr. at 42. During their visit, the two families made\na trip to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Id. The zoo was A.A.’s “favorite place”\nbecause she liked animals—especially monkeys, which she previously had watched\nwith fascination. Tr. at 42; Pet. Ex. 78 at 5. On this occasion, however, she was\ndisinterested, and cried and fussed. Tr. at 43. Mr. Allen recalled thinking that “her\nbehavior and lack of activity was because she was recovering from a bug.” Pet. Ex. 78\nat 5; see also Tr. at 43, 83. Because of her tantrums and crying, the trip was cut short.\nTr. at 43; Pet. Ex. 78 at 6. “During this weekend,” he also “noticed that [A.A.] seemed\nunsteady on her feet” and often “crawl[ed] to her destination.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 5. She\ntalked less, too. Tr. at 84. Petitioners did not take A.A. to the doctor, however. Tr. at\n83-84.\n\n       Later that month, on Thanksgiving, the family gathered at Mr. Allen’s\ngrandfather’s farm. Tr. at 43. At some point that day, Mr. Allen recalled talking to his\nmother about his concerns. Tr. at 44. He stated that she expressed concern, too,\nbecause A.A. was crawling more than walking. Id. She also seemed content to sit\nalone by herself. Tr. at 45; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 6. This was noticeably different from\nher behavior on October 14th, when she was “running around, . . . interactive with other\nkids.” Tr. at 45. In retrospect, Mr. Allen wished that he had called the doctor, but stated\nthat other than reporting that he could not “get a great Kodak moment,” he was not sure\nwhat he would have said. Tr. at 45.\n\n       Throughout the month of December 2000 “all [A.A.] wanted to do was sleep.”\nPet. Ex. 78 at 7. She also had frequent tantrums. Tr. at 86. “Her temperament\nchanged from a child with a big personality to one who would only smile occasionally.\nMostly, however, she stared off into space[.]” Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. On December 18, 2000,\nA.A. was seen by her pediatrician; however, Mr. Allen could not recall whether he\nattended or what was discussed. 57 Tr. at 84. Her behavioral problems continued to\n\n57\n     The medical record on December 18, 2000, reflects a diagnosis of early OM. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 57.\n\n\n                                                     34\n\fChristmas, which made the holiday a “disappointment.” Tr. at 46. Petitioners stayed\nhome for Christmas and were joined by A.A.’s maternal grandparents. Id. Although\nthere were a lot of gifts, A.A. showed no interest in opening any of them on Christmas\nmorning. Tr. at 46; Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. She even “cried when a gift was placed in front of\nher and left the room.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. Mr. Allen remembered that she “still seemed\nsickly,” having had an earache the prior week. Tr. at 46. Mr. Allen shot video on\nChristmas Day, 58 but noted that most of the clips showed “the good moments”—\nbecause “she was crying a lot,” they had to reshoot numerous times. Tr. at 47-48. He\nremembered that she was miserable “[t]hrough the entire day all the way up to dinner”\nand was put to bed early. Tr. at 49. “For a kid on Christmas,” her behavior was “kind of\nsurprising.” Tr. at 48. He contrasted her unhappiness with how she behaved on her\nbirthday: “opening every little gift . . . and . . . going through the cake.” Tr. at 50.\n\n        The day after Christmas, A.A. appeared to feel better, so petitioners tried again\nto get some “Kodak moments.” Tr. at 50. However, despite being more cooperative,\nher behavior was still unusual. Though she showed increased interest in her toys, she\ndid not play with them “appropriately.” Tr. at 50. For example, one of the gifts was a set\nof toy kitchenware, which she banged against a nearby clock and stacked in piles\ninstead of pretending to fix food. Tr. at 50-51. Mr. Allen stated that this was unusual—\n“before[,] she wasn’t like that.” Tr. at 51. “She was in a world of her own.” Pet. Ex. 78\nat 7.\n\n       After Christmas, A.A. “never really went back to where she was,” and it was\n“years” before she started talking again. Tr. at 51. Petitioners eventually decided to\nseek the help of specialists, because they had received no “clear answers” from her\ntreating physicians. Tr. at 52. He recalled the frustration he felt:\n\n          I’m going to the pediatrician and they’re treating her ear, they’re treating\n          her nose, they’re treating her finger, they’re treating her bellyache, they’re\n          treating her fever. They’re treating symptoms; they’re not treating the\n          whole problem. . . . And you walk out and you feel better for about a half a\n          day until you’re home again.\n\nTr. at 52. However, the medical records reflect that A.A.’s pediatrician was actively\nengaged in her care and responsive to her parents’ concerns.\n\n       On March 1, 2001, petitioners took A.A. to her 18-month well child visit. Tr. at\n86. Although he could not remember anything specific about the visit, Mr. Allen knew\nhe was concerned about her loss of speech and eye contact. Tr. at 86-87. According\nto the pediatrician’s notes of that visit, A.A. did not display some of the expected skills\nfor a child her age, including the ability to speak 4-10 words. See Pet. Ex. 9, p. 8. It\nwas noted that there had been “problems” with the previous nanny, but that A.A. was\n“opening up more” with the replacement. Id. The record indicated that Mrs. Allen 59\n58\n     Video of A.A. on December 25, 2000. Pet. Exs. 74, 81.\n59\n     The medical records of this visit do not indicate whether Mr. Allen was present.\n\n\n                                                       35\n\fexpressed concern over A.A.’s language skills, noting that she “seems to understand\n[but] sometimes refuses to talk/play games.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 18. Mrs. Allen attributed this\nto the previous nanny, with whom she was not pleased. Id. The pediatrician advised\nMrs. Allen to follow up if concerned or not seeing progress in language development\nover the next two months. Id.\n\n       On Easter, April 15, 2001, the family visited Mr. Allen’s sister at her home, also in\nVirginia. Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. Mr. Allen remembered family members noting a “dramatic\nchange” in A.A.’s behavior from when they saw her on her birthday and at\nThanksgiving. Id. His sister, for instance, noticed that A.A. would not respond when\ncalled to by name. Id. at 8. Eventually his sister became “so concerned” about the\nchanges she saw, that she and A.A.’s mother jointly called A.A.’s pediatrician “to see if\n[she] had lost her hearing.” Id. About this time, A.A. also “began tip toe walking and\nhand flapping,” as well as humming and pacing back and forth. Id.; but see Tr. at 87\n(toe walking began “later in the year of 2001”; and the hand-flapping did not become\n“prevalent” until “around the Children’s Hospital time frame” in September). To those\nwho knew her, it was “becoming increasingly apparent that something was wrong.” Pet.\nEx. 78 at 8.\n\n       On April 24, 2001, Mr. Allen completed an application for A.A.’s admission to the\nVillage Green Day School. Tr. at 87-88. On the application, he reported that his\ndaughter did not have temper tantrums and noted no physiological, behavioral, or\ndevelopmental problems or difficulties, including in the areas of speech, hearing, and\nmobility. See Pet. Ex. 7, pp. 7-8. He did mention, however, that she had a tantrum on a\nseven-hour family trip to New York. Id. When asked to explain his responses, he\nstated: “I was a first-time parent. I didn’t see my daughter as having problems. I didn’t\nsee her as abnormal. I didn’t know if any of these behaviors were normal or abnormal.\nSo that’s probably why I wrote that.” Tr. at 90. He also noted: “At that point in time, no\ndoctor had told me that there was anything wrong with her.” 60 Tr. at 91.\n\n        In late August and early September 2001, A.A. was examined at Blue Ridge\nSpeech and Hearing for a suspected hearing problem related to her recurrent OM. The\nresultant examination report noted that A.A. had reportedly “said her first word ‘quack’ at\none year and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months, [but] stopped\nspeaking after having three ear infections in a row.” Tr. at 92 (quoting Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5).\nWhen asked if this was accurate, Mr. Allen clarified that A.A. “began to stop speaking in\nbetween each ear infection – that sentence reads as if after the three ear infections, she\nstopped speaking.” Tr. at 93. Instead, “she had three ear infections as her language\nskills were deteriorating.” Tr. at 93. The report concluded with a tentative diagnosis of\nautism. Tr. at 53; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 8-9.\n\n\n\n60\n  This report may be technically correct in that a diagnosis of speech/language delay was not made until\nMay 2001, but it was clear from the March 1, 2001 well child visit that A.A.’s mother had concerns about\nher development, and said that she refused to talk and play games. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 18\n\n\n                                                   36\n\f        According to Mr. Allen, he and his wife were surprised by the diagnosis—in fact,\nit was the “first time” that he had heard the word “autism.” Tr. at 53. He recalled staying\nup every night, reading “about autism until 3 or 4 in the morning. During those hours,\n[A.A] would wake up screaming and the only thing that would calm her down was\nwatching cartoons with music in our bedroom.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 9; see also Tr. at 96, 98-\n100.\n\n       On September 6, 2001, petitioners consulted with Dr. Lavenstein, a neurologist\nat Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. Tr. at 55. He ordered additional testing, the\nresults of which supported the ASD diagnosis. Pet. Ex. 78 at 10. Mr. Allen then\n“applied to get [A.A.] into Kennedy Krieger through a referral” and was successful. Tr.\nat 57; Pet. Ex. 78 at 10.\n\n        Additionally, during this period A.A. underwent a bilateral tympanostomy to treat\nher recurrent OM. 61 The procedure reportedly did nothing to improve her behavior—\n“she was still not responding.” Tr. at 53. She was also taken to the Fairfax Hospital\nEmergency Department during the Christmas season in 2001 because of “one of [her]\nscreaming episodes.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 9. Testing revealed that she was “suffering from\nintestinal blockages. She was not digesting the food and it was acting like a poison in\nher body.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 9. Petitioners eventually learned that A.A. had allergies to\ndairy and eggs—a condition commonly found in children with autism. Pet. Ex. 78 at 9.\n\n       When asked to identify the time frame in which he first connected the MMR\nvaccine to A.A.’s problems, Mr. Allen reported that it “was a slow gradual process of\nkind of putting one and one together and coming up with two.” Tr. at 96. Although he\ncould not say for sure, he thought it was “probably . . . late 2001.” Tr. at 97. To assist\nhis memory during testimony, Mr. Allen was shown a January 2002 medical record,\nwhich reflected his statement that he was “100 percent sure that [A.A.]’s problems are\nfrom her MMR immunization. Her behavior started 30 days post-MMR.” Tr. at 97\n(quoting Pet. Ex. 9, p. 35). In view of the record, Mr. Allen testified: “At that time, if I\nsaid I was 100 percent certain, I meant it.” Tr. at 97.\n\n       In January 2002, petitioners were notified that A.A. would no longer be allowed to\nattend Village Green Day School due to behavioral difficulties. Tr. at 106. Mr. Allen\nrecalled that “during that time frame . . . she was having the screaming fits.” Tr. at 106.\n\n       In February 2002, petitioners met with Dr. Zimmerman for the first time. Tr. at\n57. After an extensive workup, Dr. Zimmerman validated the ASD diagnosis. Tr. at 58.\nHe then recommended that A.A. be tested for mitochondrial disorder to help guide her\ntreatment. Id. Mr. Allen remembered that the testing, which involved obtaining a blood\nspecimen, was very difficult because A.A. struggled against the procedure. Tr. at 58-\n59. After obtaining the results, Dr. Zimmerman informed petitioners that A.A. “tested\npositive for mitochondrial disorder” and referred them to Dr. Kelley for further testing\nand evaluation. Tr. at 59.\n\n\n61\n     See n.34, supra, dating the procedure as likely occurring in October 2001.\n\n                                                      37\n\f       When petitioners met with Dr. Kelley, he confirmed that A.A. had a mitochondrial\ndisorder and explained his recommended treatment was a “vitamin cocktail” that\nincluded Coenzyme Q10. Tr. at 61-62. Mr. Allen testified that after A.A. began the Dr.\nKelley’s prescribed treatment, her behavior slowly, but steadily improved. Tr. at 62-63;\nPet. Ex. 78 at 10. Although she continued to toe-walk on occasion and have difficulty in\nsocial situations, other areas were positively changed. Tr. at 63. For example, she\nbegan to make eye contact, “her voice came back,” she was better able “to\nconceptualize, particularly . . . in reading,” and her confidence increased. Tr. at 63.\n\n       As of the time of the hearing, A.A. was, according to Mr. Allen, progressing in her\ndevelopment and doing well in school. 62 Tr. at Tr. at 63-68. Although her social skills\nwere “not quite there,” she was learning to interact with her peers and had made a\nfriend at school; however, she was generally more comfortable around adults. Tr. at 63-\n64. He indicated that she still had stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, but\ntook medication to reduce these symptoms. Tr. at 65-67. She also continued to take\n“part of the cocktail.” Tr. at 65.\n\nB. Ms. Susan Edick.\n\n       Ms. Edick testified that she was employed as a special education teacher in New\nYork State. Tr. at 108. She earned a Bachelor of Science in education and special\neducation from Syracuse University and a Masters of Science in education from State\nUniversity of New York in Cortland. Pet. Ex. 79 at 1-2. She was certified in New York\nState in “Special Education for Infants to Adults, Early Childhood Education, Elementary\nEducation for Grades K-6 and Reading/Literacy Education for Grades K-12.” Pet. Ex.\n79 at 2.\n\n       According to Ms. Edick, her training included learning the signs and symptoms of\nvarious developmental disorders, including “emotional [and] learning disabilities and\nautism.” 63 Tr. at 109. Two classes in particular focused on autism, with exercises on\nhow to identify autistic behaviors and educate children with the disorder. Tr. at 109-10.\nShe also studied normal growth and development in children of school age. Tr. at 109.\n\n       In the field of education, Ms. Edick worked as a K-4 resource teacher, performed\nstudent teaching in an early education program with special needs children, and taught\nspecial education children in an integrated co-teaching classroom. Tr. at 110. Some of\nher responsibilities have included test modification, evaluation and support of student\nIndividualized Education Plans [“IEPs”], and identification and improvement of areas of\nweakness, such as “social behavioral” issues or a “learning disability in reading and\nwriting.” Tr. at 110-11. Over the course of her career, Ms. Edick has both taught\n\n62\n  Mr. Allen reported that A.A. was a “straight A” student in her program. Tr. at 64, 68. She was looking\nforward to attending high school the following year. Tr. at 68.\n63\n  It is unclear whether Ms. Edick had training and experience in identifying developmental disorders in\npre-school-age children.\n\n\n                                                    38\n\fautistic children and been responsible for identifying those with autism spectrum\ndisorder symptoms who might require intervention. Tr. at 111. She stated that in her\nwork she might, for example, identify “learning disabilities or learning patterns in kids or\nserve on the committee for the school . . . [to] recommend further testing with a\npsychologist or with speech and language therapists or with specialists, ear, nose and\nthroat, or doctors.” Tr. at 111.\n\n        Ms. Edick testified that, as a close relative, she had frequent opportunities to visit\npetitioners and observe A.A.’s growth and development. Tr. at 112; see also Pet. Ex.\n79 at 2. She also spoke often with A.A.’s mother—her sister—on the telephone. Tr. at\n112. “[W]e would discuss different activities, what was going on with them in life or\nfamily.” Tr. at 112.\n\n        Though she did not attend A.A.’s first birthday party, she remembered seeing\nA.A. when petitioners visited over the Labor Day weekend in September, when she was\nalmost 14 months old. Tr. at 112; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 2-3. According to Ms. Edick,\nA.A. seemed “very happy, very healthy” during their stay. Tr. at 113. From what she\nobserved, A.A. “seemed very normal, [with] typical development for a child socially,\ncognitively, physically. She was walking. She was talking, typical vocabulary, one-word\nvocabulary.” Tr. at 113. A.A. sometimes used gestures to communicate, such as\npointing, bouncing, or taking one by the hand. Tr. at 113, 123. However, Ms. Edick\nspecifically recalled that she could say “the words that a child would have at that time”\nand “numbers and count a little bit.” Tr. at 113. She estimated that A.A. knew\n“approximately 12 to 20 words at that time.” 64 Tr. at 123. None of A.A.’s behaviors at\nthat time concerned her. Tr. at 113, 115. “She enjoyed playing . . . peek-a-boo, playing\nso big. If you asked her how old she was, she would hold up her finger, one.” Tr. at\n113. She appeared to understand what was being said and “would look to you to\ninteract and . . . play.” Tr. at 113. Ms. Edick noted A.A.’s eye contact in the photo taken\nof her playing croquet in her yard—“she was laughing and smiling for the camera.” Tr.\nat 114 (discussing Pet. Ex. 76).\n\n       On Halloween, Ms. Edick recalled speaking to her sister on the telephone and\nasking if A.A. was dressing up to go trick-or-treating. Tr. at 116. She replied that A.A.\n“hadn’t been feeling well, she was running a fever and had been for a few days.” Tr. at\n116; see also Tr. at 123; Pet. Ex. 79 at 3. Her sister promised to “dress her up another\nday and . . . send pictures when she’s feeling better.” Tr. at 116.\n\n         On Veterans Day weekend, the Edicks visited petitioners at their home. Tr. at\n116; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 3. During that visit, she became “very concerned because .\n. . it was apparent that [A.A.] was showing signs of development[al] regression, which\nincluded . . . an absence of speech and communication . . . [and] eye contact. Tr. 116-\n\n64\n    This estimate contrasts with Mr. Allen’s testimony that A.A. knew “well over 100 words” by her first\nbirthday (Tr. at 70-72) and the earlier report that she spoke “her first word ‘Quack’ at 1 year and [spoke] a\nlittle more/using animal sounds at 15 months” (Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5). A.A.’s pediatrician assessed her as\nhaving one to three words at her one-year well child visit. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10.\n\n\n                                                     39\n\f17; see also Tr. at 124; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 3. Her behavior was noticeably\nchanged.\n\n       She tended to just want to [lie] on the floor, or if we tried to pick her up,\n       she didn’t want us to touch her or pick her up. She would just stare at her\n       hand, stare at her bear, stare at the carpet and pick the threads in the\n       carpet. And it was quite alarming to me.\n\nTr. at 117.\n\n        And when the families visited the National Zoo, “[s]he stayed in her stroller all\nday” and showed “no interest in anything at the zoo.” Tr. at 117; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at\n3. Ms. Edick remembered that A.A. “cried a lot, whimpered” – “it was a very difficult trip\nfor her.” Tr. at 117-18; see also Tr. at 128; Pet. Ex. 79 at 4. Following the visit, Ms.\nEdick “may have said something” about her concerns to A.A.’s parents, but she did\nrecall talking to her own parents “because [she] was very concerned[,] especially since\n[A.A.] had show[n] typical development in September.” Tr. at 119; see also Tr. at 124-\n25, 130-31; Pet. Ex. 79 at 4. She stated that what she saw “really affected” her\nbecause A.A.’s “behaviors were autistic-type behaviors on the spectrum, signs of it.” Tr.\nat 119; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 4. She was not certain, though, that A.A. actually had\nautism and hoped instead that the behaviors were due to an illness. Tr. at 127, 130.\n\n        In December, Ms. Edick asked her parents to observe A.A. during their\nChristmas visit and report back on her behaviors and whether she had improved. Tr. at\n119; see also Tr. at 124-25, 130. When they returned home, they informed Ms. Edick\nthat the signs she had observed were “still apparent.” Tr. at 119. They also expressed\nthat “they were extremely upset because [A.A.] was having constant tantrums . . .\nthrowing herself back and hitting her head on the floor.” Tr. at 119; see also Pet. Ex. 79\nat 4. Because of her behaviors, they left without seeing her open any gifts. Tr. at 119.\nMs. Edick stated that she spoke with her sister after the holidays and “asked her at\ndifferent times to talk to their pediatrician, . . . or follow through with a specialist, an ear\nnose and throat person to see if there was anything wrong with [A.A.’s] hearing or\nbehavior.” Tr. at 126.\n\n        In April 2001, their families gathered together for Easter. At that time, A.A. “was\nwalking again, but . . . still did not communicate through speech or many gestures.” Tr.\nat 120; see also Tr. at 128. Ms. Edick also recalled that she “did not want to socially\ninteract with her grandparents or anyone,” or engage in any age-appropriate activities.\nTr. at 120. Also of concern was her unresponsiveness “to her name or commands” in\npotentially dangerous situations. Tr. at 120; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 5. She observed\nA.A. to “just run randomly” into the woods or a nearby yard and that she did “not\nrespond to her name or commands.” Tr. at 120; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 5. According to\nMs. Edick, this was different from her previous behavior. Previously A.A. “always\nresponded and stayed around people”—[i]f you called her, she would come to you.” Tr.\nat 120.\n\n\n\n                                               40\n\f        In the summer of 2001, the Edicks visited petitioners. During their stay, she\nnoted that some of the abnormal behaviors were persisting—“she still did not\ncommunicate, she still was not talking,” and she still did not “have a lot of eye contact.”\nTr. at 121; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 5. She also remembered that A.A. “was having a lot\nof crying and tantrums[,] . . . did not want to keep her clothes on[,]” and appeared to be\n“experiencing some . . . sensory issues[.]” Tr. at 121-22.\n\n       Ms. Edick indicated that she was not surprised when A.A. was evaluated on the\nautism spectrum, as she eventually suspected—and suggested—that autism was a\npossibility. Tr. at 122, 133-34. By that point, petitioners also did not seem too\nsurprised, either. Tr. at 133. Although it was “very devastating” to accept, they had\nbeen seeking answers for some time—“it was such a bad period of time for them.” Tr.\nat 133.\n\n                                       V. Expert Qualifications.\n\n         Four physicians offered opinions on vaccine causation and other matters in\ndispute. All of the experts were well-qualified to offer opinions in this case. Petitioners’\nexperts opined that A.A. had an underlying mitochondrial disorder that made her\nvulnerable to the inflammatory effects of the MMR vaccine she received at her 15-\nmonth well child visit. As a result of her vaccination, she experienced a rapid regression\nand ultimately developed “mitochondrial autism.” Respondent’s experts opined that\nA.A. did not have a mitochondrial abnormality or suffer a rapid regression. Instead, she\nexhibited signs of autism prior to vaccination and followed a typical course thereafter. In\ntheir view, the MMR vaccine did not aggravate an underlying condition or cause her to\ndevelop ASD.\n\nA. Petitioners’ Experts.\n\n        Petitioners presented testimony from two experts: Dr. Andrew W. Zimmerman,\nan expert in pediatric neurology, and Dr. Richard I. Kelley, an expert in metabolism.\nBoth physicians were involved in A.A.’s treatment and were familiar with her general\nmedical history and development; however, neither was a treater at the time of\nvaccination or a contemporaneous witness to the onset of her condition. As such, these\nparticular treating physicians are no more knowledgeable about what actually transpired\nafter the vaccination than any other physician who testified in this case.\n\n          1. Andrew W. Zimmerman, M.D. 65\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman earned his medical degree from Columbia University. Tr. at\n289. He completed a pediatric internship at the University of Michigan, and a neurology\nresidency at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Tr. at 289-90.

Ex. 26 at 3.\n\n           2. Richard I. Kelley, M.D., Ph.D. 67\n\n       Doctor Kelly earned his medical degree and a Ph.D. in pathology/molecular\nbiology from the University of Pennsylvania, where he participated in a combined\nPh.D./M.D. program. Tr. at 135; Pet. Ex. 24 at 1. He completed a residency in\npediatrics and a postdoctoral fellowship in medical genetics at The Children’s Hospital\nof Philadelphia [“CHOP”], after which he spent approximately five years on the CHOP\nfaculty in the departments of metabolism and genetics. Tr. at 135-36; Pet. Ex. 24 at 1.\nSubsequently, he joined the faculty of the department of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine [“JHU”] and also became a staff physician at the Kennedy\nKrieger Institute [“KKI”]. Id. Both institutions are located in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n        Doctor Kelley is currently a professor of pediatrics at JHU and director of the\ndivision of metabolism at KKI. Tr. at 136; Pet. Ex. 24 at 1. In addition to an active\nclinical practice, he oversees several KKI laboratories that conduct biochemical and\ngenetic testing. Tr. at 136-37. He is also “the principal advisor for the neurology\ndivision” and a coordinator for the “neurogenetics division.” Tr. at 137. His academic\nresponsibilities include teaching medical residents, “mostly . . . on an individual basis,”\nand performing “consultations . . . when a question falls into [his] areas of expertise.” Id.\n\n       He is board certified in pediatrics, clinical genetics, biochemical genetics, and\ncytogenetics. Tr. at 138; Pet. Ex. 24 at 13. Doctor Kelley stated that he is regularly\nconsulted as a mitochondrial expert both domestically and internationally. Tr. at 139-40.\nHe is “the go-to person” for certain developmental diseases and has been consulted on\n\n\n66\n  Doctor Zimmerman testified that he was on the faculty for eight years; however, his resume indicated\nthat it was between six and seven years (January 1977 to August 1983). Pet. Ex. 26 at 1-2.\n67\n     Doctor Kelley’s CV was filed as Pet. Ex. 24, and his expert report was filed as Pet.

Pet. Ex. 24 at 2-11. He has written about “a fairly broad spectrum of\nmetabolic abnormalities that largely come from clinical practice.” Tr. at 138. His work\nhas “been largely with metabolic and so-called inborn errors of metabolism;” however,\nthe focus of his research “basically depends on what comes up in the clinic or . . . our\nlaboratory” at any given time. Id.\n\n       Doctor Kelley previously served on numerous committees and boards, including\njournal review boards. Pet. Ex. 24 at 13-14. However, he resigned or withdrew from\nthem beginning around 2006, when demands on his time increased. Tr. at 141.\n\nB. Respondent’s Experts.\n\n       Respondent presented testimony from two experts: Dr. Max Wiznitzer, an expert\nin pediatric neurology and developmental disabilities, and Dr. Stephen Cederbaum, an\nexpert in pediatrics, inborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disease, and\ngenetics.\n\n          1. Max Wiznitzer, M.D. 68\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer earned his medical degree from Northwestern University, and\ncompleted a pediatrics residency at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Tr. at 476. He\nalso completed fellowships in development disorders at the Cincinnati Center for\nDevelopmental Disorders and in child neurology at the University of Pennsylvania\nSystem and at the Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia. Id. Additionally, he completed a\nNational Institutes of Health National Research Service Award Fellowship in disorders\nof higher cortical function in children at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New\nYork. Id.\n\n        Since 1986, Dr. Wiznitzer has been a full-time staff neurologist at Rainbow\nBabies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Tr. at 477. In his capacity, Dr.\nWiznitzer has treated “thousands of children and . . . adults” with autism. Tr. at 482. He\nhas “an extremely busy clinical practice” that provides him the opportunity to “see\npatients four to five half-days a week.” Tr. at 480. He routinely reads EEGs, assists the\nepilepsy team when a member is out of town, and works “at least eight weeks in the\nyear on the inpatient medical service,” where he is responsible for “any children\nadmitted to the neurology service” and provides consults on any neurology questions.\nTr. at 480-81.\n\n       Additionally, Dr. Wiznitzer is a professor of pediatrics and neurology and\ninternational health at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Tr. at 477.\n\n68\n     Doctor Wiznitzer’s CV was filed as Res. Ex. L, and his expert report was filed as Res. Ex. K.\n\n\n                                                       43\n\fHe has conducted research in a variety of areas, with a special interest in autism, which\nhe began studying in 1986. Tr. at 481. As a researcher, he has been involved in “two\nseminal studies looking at the differentiation between autism, kids with developmental\nlanguage disorder, and children [with] mental retardation.” Id. Most recently, he\nparticipated in a study with high-functioning autistic children that sought “to alter the[ir]\ndevelopmental trajectory” through “a pharmacologic intervention.” Tr. at 481-82.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer is board certified in pediatrics, neurodevelopmental disabilities,\nand neurology, with special qualification in child neurology.

Cederbaum, M.D. 69\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum earned his medical degree from New York University School\nof Medicine, and completed an internship and residency at Washington University\nSchool of Medicine in St. Louis. Tr. at 376. Subsequently he worked for the National\nInstitutes of Health, fulfilling his military service obligation, where he conducted\nbiochemical research. Id. He then returned to Washington University for training in\nmedical genetics, after which he accepted a position at the University of California at\nLos Angeles [“UCLA”]. Id. At UCLA, Dr. Cederbaum taught medical students, cared for\npatients with genetic disorders (particularly those with inborn errors of metabolism), and\nconducted basic scientific research, with a focus on urea cycle disorders and inborn\nerrors. Tr. at 377-78.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum is board certified in clinical genetics and biochemical\ngenetics. Tr. at 378. He has published 150 peer-reviewed articles and 80 to 90\nchapters and other contributions. Tr. at 379. Although he has not published extensively\nin the field of mitochondrial disease, he considered himself a “pioneer” on the subject\ndue to his publication of “one of the first cases of mitochondrial disorders” in the 1970s.\nId. He also “was a pioneer in the area of pyruvate hydrogenase deficiency, developing\nthe first dietary therapy for it.” Id. He has also lectured on mitochondrial disease\nnationally and internationally. Tr. at 381.\n\n      He is currently a professor emeritus at UCLA, which has allowed him to continue\nmany of his previous pursuits, but at a reduced level of responsibility. Tr. at 377. He\nremains current with developments, research, and literature in the field of inborn errors\nof metabolism, and is a reviewer for a variety of journals. Tr. at 377, 379-80. Doctor\nCederbaum has received notable honors and awards and remains a member of several\n\n\n69\n     Doctor Cederbaum’s CV was filed as Res. Ex. B, and his expert report was filed as Res. Ex.

Medical Literature.\n\n      The volume of medical literature submitted into the record renders a separate\nsummary of each article impractical. Although I read and considered every piece of\nmedical literature in the record, only the articles addressed by the experts or that I relied\nupon in coming to my conclusion will be specifically referenced below.\n\nB. Expert Opinion and Testimony.\n\n       1. Doctor Zimmerman.\n\n       In his expert report, submitted prior to hearing, Dr. Zimmerman recounted that\nA.A. “had normal development until 16 months when she regressed in language and\nsocial skills within 1 – 2 weeks following immunization with MMR vaccine.” Pet. Ex. 25\nat 1. Based on her history, his evaluation and testing, and her response to treatment,\nDr. Zimmerman concluded that A.A. “had a disorder of mitochondrial metabolism\nassociated with autistic regression.” Id. at 2. The report, however, contained no\nstatement addressing the role of the MMR vaccine in the development of this condition.\n\n         Doctor Zimmerman began his direct testimony at hearing with a review of A.A.’s\nmedical history and his involvement in her treatment. He first saw A.A. at an initial\nevaluation on February 13, 2002, when she was 30 months of age. He recalled that\nshe presented with “a history of autism following regression.” Tr. at 292. Based on\nparental report, she regressed “one to two weeks following her MMR immunization” with\na “los[s of] language and eye contact and social interaction.” Id. He stated that her\nearly development “appeared to be normal” from “all standpoints”—she “had met all her\nmilestones.” Tr. at 292-93. Because of her history and presentation, Dr. Zimmerman\n“initiated a workup of genetic and metabolic studies.” Id. 70\n\n\n70\n   In his evaluation, Dr. Zimmerman wrote that A.A. “presents an atypical history and appearance\nconsistent with an encephalopathy and a pervasive developmental disorder (autism spectrum). A history\nof regressive encephalopathy suggests the need for genetic testing, chromosomes and DNA for fragile X\nand quantitative plasma amino acids and urine organic acids.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24. He also “requested\ngenetic testing to rule out Rett syndrome.” Id.\n\n\n                                                 45\n\f       In response to questioning on cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman stated that the\nhistory he gave of A.A.’s regression in language and social skills shortly after her MMR\nimmunization was based entirely on statements from her parents. Tr. at 347-48. He\nalso indicated that prior to her initial evaluation he had not reviewed any of her medical\nrecords, although he has since done so. 71 Id. When asked whether he found any\nindication in the medical records of developmental abnormalities or changed behavior\nwithin one to two weeks of her immunization, he stated “I don’t believe so, no.” Tr. at\n348.\n\n        During his testimony, Dr. Zimmerman viewed and commented on several\nsegments of home video taken on October 14, 2000, about nine days before A.A.’s\nimmunization. Petitioners argued that the video provides a demonstrative baseline for\nher pre-vaccination behavior and developmental achievement. In the video, which was\ntaken at petitioners’ home, A.A. seemed “quite lively.” Tr. at 294. She appeared to\nrespond to her name and play appropriately with toys, and said “quack” when asked\nwhat noise a duck makes. Tr. at 294-95. When questioned about her age, she\nindicated with a raised finger that she was one year old. Doctor Zimmerman assessed\nthis behavior as appropriate for A.A.’s age. Tr. at 295. He also observed that in an\nearlier frame she was “pointing with [her] index finger”—an “important prelinguistic\ngesture that children develop around one year of age[.]” Tr. at 295-96.\n\n       He further noted that A.A. was appropriately interactive with her parents. Tr. at\n296. “She’s smiling and responsive and looking at the camera. I think she’s actually\nmaking eye contact with the person who’s taking the film.” Tr. at 297. As for her\nlanguage development, she was “not forming words,” but “making word sounds.” Tr. at\n297. This was not a point of concern, but instead, evidence that “she’s developing\nlanguage.” Tr. at 297. For example, when she said “moo” in response to the question\n“What does a cow say?”, she was not simply repeating a sound someone made to her,\nbut responding to a question. Tr. at 298. “She’s practicing to be two.” Tr. at 298.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman stated that a 15-month-old child would\ntypically have three words with meaning. Tr. at 343. When asked whether he heard\nA.A. say any words in the above-described video clip, he stated: “I guess the ‘quack,’\nand at one point she said ‘moo.’” Tr. at 344. He also recalled her “babbling some word\nsounds,” but no other specific words. Id. When pressed whether he believed “moo”\nand “quack” were words rather than sounds, he stated that “moo” was a word in this\ncontext because A.A.’s response “was prompted only by the question, not by the\nsound.” 72 Tr. at 344.\n\n71\n   I directed Dr. Zimmerman to consider the initial audiological evaluation of A.A. from Blue Ridge Speech\n& Hearing, which states: “Speech and language landmarks were reported as age-appropriate to a point,\nsaid first word at one year, spoke a little more at 15 months, stopped speaking after having three ear\ninfections in a row.” Tr. at 368 (quoting Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5). I asked him whether he still would have\nattributed A.A.’s regression to her MMR vaccination had he seen that record or been provided that history\nby her parents. Tr. at 368. He responded: “I would have taken this into consideration, yes.” Id.\n72\n   On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman confirmed that “moo” is a legitimate word. He stated that the 1983 edition\nof Webster’s Dictionary “clearly says it’s a verb, to make the characteristic sound of a cow. So, she had a\n\n                                                    46\n\f       He was also questioned about his comment that A.A. appeared to be making eye\ncontact with the person taking the video. Tr. at 344-45. When asked whether he could\ndifferentiate between her “interacting or making eye contact with the person,” and her\nsimply “looking at the camera,” he conceded that he could not know what she was\nlooking at. Tr. at 345.\n\n        In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman confirmed that he saw A.A.\npointing on the video, but that he did not see any evidence of her using words, “except\n[for] what we have said, the – saying ‘moo’ and ‘quack’.” Tr. at 358. As for her raising a\nfinger to show her age, he agreed that the action was not an indication that she knew\nher numbers, but that she had been “keyed or trained or talked to about putting that\nfinger up.” Tr. at 358; see also Tr. at 683-84. He also indicated that her reported ability\nto name colors was probably overstated based on the level of development he saw on\nthe video. Tr. at 358-59 (citing Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15 (reporting that prior to her regression\n“she knew her colors and was using words and was pointing”)). 73 “It would be a little\nadvanced, actually.” Tr. at 359.\n\n       In a later segment of the video, A.A. demonstrated normal gross motor skills by\nrunning around the house. Tr. at 295. Doctor Zimmerman commented that “[s]he has\nquite a good running gait for a child of that age.” Tr. at 298. He also noted that she\nstood “without difficulty” and was “quite independent.” Tr. at 298. In another clip, she\nwas seen actively exploring her surroundings, responding to the word “no”, and feeding\nherself—behaviors he judged as age-appropriate. Tr. at 299. When the video\nconcluded, Dr. Zimmerman stated that A.A. “appear[ed] normal in . . . all respects.” Tr.\nat 299.\n\n        On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman was asked to elaborate on the development that he\nsaw during the October 14 video which he considered to be normal. Tr. at 674. He\nstated that overall he “thought the language, the social interaction and her movements\nwere normal. Her activities . . . were appropriate for age.” Tr. at 674-75. It is unclear\nwhy he considered her language to be normal and age appropriate. He previously\ntestified that a 15-month old child would have three words with meaning, but\ncharacterized A.A.’s speech, as seen in the video, as “babbling” and stated that she\nwas not forming words. See Tr. at 297, 344.\n\n\n\nword.” Tr. at 677; see also Tr. at 680 (recross). He emphasized that it is a “meaningful” word “which is\nrecognized.” Tr. at 677. I conclude that “moo” was not a word that A.A. used to communicate; rather, it\nwas a response to “what does the cow say,” just as holding up her index finger was a trained response to\na question about her age.\n73\n   See also Tr. at 33 (Mr. Allen stating that A.A. “understood the colors” of the croquet balls when she\nplayed the game over the Labor Day holiday in September 2000). I have no difficulty accepting that she\nunderstood that the balls were of different colors, and that one particular colored ball was “hers,” but that\nis a far cry from knowing colors and labeling items with their color when asked to do so—a more common\nmeaning for “knowing her colors.”\n\n\n                                                     47\n\f         Doctor Zimmerman also was asked to specifically comment on what he\nconsidered to be developmentally normal in A.A.’s behavior at the pumpkin patch that\nsame day. Tr. at 675. In response, he identified her interest in the pumpkins and her\nability to stoop and recover when playing with them. Id. She had a good running gait\nand was stable when walking. Id. He noted “a lot of facial expression” and “some\nreciprocal interaction with her parents.” Id. He further noted that he did not perceive\nany difference in her behavior at the pumpkin patch from the earlier scenes when she\nwas alone with her parents at home. Id.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman was asked to review the medical record of A.A.’s 15-month\nwell child visit, which occurred on October 23, 2000. 74 Tr. at 300. He stated that the\nrecord reflected “normal” development on all measured criteria. Tr. at 301. It also\nindicated that she received three vaccinations on that occasion: “MMR number one, Hib\nbooster, and Hep-B.” Tr. at 301.\n\n       Petitioners played several segments of home video taken on October 29, 2000,\nsix days after A.A.’s immunization. Petitioners argued that the video shows marked\nchanges in A.A.’s behavior. The video captured various moments during the pre-\nHalloween party that took place outdoors in petitioners’ neighborhood.\n\n       After viewing the video, Dr. Zimmerman observed that A.A. seemed “less lively,”\nhad “virtually no facial expression,” and looked as though she did not “feel well.” Tr. at\n301; see also Tr. at 678 (redirect). He also noted that she did not look at the camera or\ninteract with her parents. Id. And although she walked at times, it seemed “stilted.” Tr.\nat. 301; see also Tr. at 682 (recross). During one clip, A.A. is seen walking with her\nparents but was “not showing much expression on her own and [didn’t] seem to be [as]\ninterested in things, as she was before.” Tr. at 302; see also Tr. at 677-78 (redirect);\n682 (recross). In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman reiterated that he\nthought A.A.’s “motor activity was diminished” and that she had less facial emotion as\ncompared to her behavior on October 14. Tr. at 684-85.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman indicated that the behavioral changes seen in the video\ncorrelated with the parental report that A.A. changed “within one to two weeks of the\nMMR immunization.” Tr. at 302-03.\n\n         I asked Dr. Zimmerman whether the October 23 well child record reflected\nsymptoms of an illness or a cold. Tr. at 353-54. He responded that it noted ear tugging,\nnasal congestion for one week, and treatment with the antibiotic amoxicillin. Tr. at 354.\nHe confirmed that treatment with amoxicillin was indicative of an ear infection. Id. I\nthen recalled his statement that A.A. appeared ill in the October 29th video and asked\nwhether her behavior could have been the result of the illness reflected in the medical\nrecord. Id. He stated that he “would expect if the amoxicillin were treating an ear\ninfection, that she would have felt better by . . . six days later.” Id. He agreed, however,\nthat if the infection was viral rather than bacterial, she might have still felt ill. Id.\n\n74\n     Pet. Ex. 9, p. 9.\n\n\n                                            48\n\f        I also asked Dr. Zimmerman about differences between the videos with regard to\nenvironment. Tr. at 355. He noted that the first video was taken at home, while the\nsecond was shot “outside in a party atmosphere.” Id. He acknowledged that “they\n[we]ren’t directly comparable” and discussed the impact that environment can have on a\nchild’s behavior. Tr. at 355-56. For example, if she were really shy, she might not feel\ncomfortable participating in the activities. He stated, though, that he “would have\nexpected her to be more reactive to her parents . . . and have more expression.” Tr. at\n356. Overall, however, he did not think the environment was a factor. Tr. at 679\n(redirect).\n\n        Petitioners showed home video taken on Christmas Day 2000. Doctor\nZimmerman observed that “[t]his [was] two months later, the opening [of] presents, and\nshe doesn’t show, again, interaction with the parents or . . . the toys. Tr. at 303. She\nalso was “not vocalizing like she was initially” and “show[ed] very little facial expression,\nif any[.]” Tr. at 303.\n\n      Doctor Zimmerman was then asked to opine on the significance of the behavioral\nchanges seen in the videos. Specifically, were they due to a transitory illness or\npossibly the result of her vaccination? He stated that, in his view, the post-vaccination\nvideos indicated that her changes were not due to a temporary sickness, because she\nwould have improved by Christmas. Tr. at 303. Instead, “her condition five days after\nthe doctor’s visit appeared to persist . . . two months later.” Tr. at 303-04.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman was asked whether he had seen any\nvideo of A.A. taken during the two-month period between October 29th and December\n25th, or reviewed any medical records from that same period. Tr. at 346. He stated\nthat apart from petitioners’ affidavits, he had not seen any contemporaneous evidence.\nTr. at 346.\n\n        Doctor Zimmerman next discussed his initial evaluation of A.A. on February 13,\n2002. See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 23. In his report he noted that “[s]he was fussy and showed\nmany features of autism; she didn’t engage or sustain eye contact; she had word\nsounds . . . and would seek her parents’ attention at times[.]” Tr. at 304. She was\nreluctant to engage in “ball-play” and demonstrated “mild instability in her truncal gait.”\nTr. at 305. He stated that her history and physical presentation—specifically, her “lack\nof language [and] eye contact, and repetitive behaviors,” as well as her lack of\nreciprocation—led him to conclude that she “had an autism spectrum disorder.” Tr. at\n305.\n\n      Following his diagnosis, he ordered genetic and metabolic testing in an effort to\ndiscover the cause of her condition. Tr. at 305. The genetic test results were normal;\nhowever, several lab studies “showed . . . differences in her amino acids and liver\nenzymes, such as AST [aspartate transaminase] and ALT [alanine transaminase] and\nCK [creatine kinase].” Tr. at 306.\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\f        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman was asked to elaborate on his statement\nin his initial evaluation that A.A. “presents an atypical history and appearance consistent\nwith an encephalopathy and a pervasive developmental disorder, autism spectrum.” Tr.\nat 348 (citing Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24). In response to questioning, he clarified that what he\nwas “really saying” was that she had “atypical development.” Tr. at 348. He stated that\nhe was trying to express that “[r]egression is not typical development.” Tr. at 348. He\nalso found the “rapidity of her regression to be striking.” Tr. at 349. It was “somewhat\nunusual\" and not characteristic of those seen in the general autism spectrum disorder\npopulation. Tr. at 349.\n\n       I questioned Dr. Zimmerman regarding the asserted rapidity of A.A.’s regression.\nSpecifically, I asked him to consider the time period between the October 14 (pre-\nvaccination) video and the December 25 (post-vaccination) video, without regard to the\nOctober 29 video, and state whether he would still consider the behavioral changes to\nbe rapid. Tr. at 353. He responded: “Three months would not be rapid, no.” Tr. at 353.\n\n        A.A. was next seen by Dr. Zimmerman on July 15, 2002. Doctor Zimmerman\nreviewed the follow-up note he wrote after that visit. 75 He stated that he “wanted to get\nfurther testing and recommended the organic acids” and other tests because he\nsuspected “that she might have mitochondrial problems.” Tr. at 306-07. The basis for\nthis belief was A.A.’s “apparently rapid deterioration following her MMR vaccine”—a\npattern he had seen in other children with mitochondrial problems. Tr. at 307. He\nstated that he has “seen about 20 [children] over the years who have had this pattern\nand . . . then show up with elevated CK, AST, and alanine.” Tr. at 307. He noted that\n“most” of the cases “were in conjunction with Dr. Kelley,” but that he had “seen them\nseparately from consultation with him.” Tr. at 307. Doctor Zimmerman confirmed that\nhe ordered additional testing, including “lactic acid, serum chemistries, liver functions,\n[and] CK – CPK [creatine phosphokinase].” Tr. at 308.\n\n       A neurology clinic follow-up note from A.A.’s next visit, on November 4, 2002,\nreflected the results of her laboratory testing. 76 Doctor Zimmerman recounted that “her\nlactate was slightly elevated, but CK was elevated, as was her AST.” Tr. at 309. With\nregard to her elevated lactate, he explained that any struggling during the procedure\nwould likely have affected the results. 77 In view of this, Dr. Zimmerman repeated some\nof the studies, the results of which were listed at the bottom of the record. Of particular\ninterest were her elevated CK and AST levels. Tr. at 309. These outcomes led Dr.\nZimmerman to assume that A.A. “might have mitochondrial dysfunction” and to “start[]\nher on levocarnitine [L-carnitine] or Carnitor.” Tr. at 310.\n\n\n\n75\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n76\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19.\n77\n  He also stated that “her potassium [was] also slightly elevated, which could be for a number of reasons,\nbut it [struggling] could have also played into that.” Tr. at 309.\n\n\n                                                   50\n\f        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman explained that he did not order a repeat\ntest of A.A.’s plasma lactate because lactate testing is often unreliable as a measure.\nTr. at 350. He stated that “unless you’re there when the lactate is drawn and know . . .\nexactly how it was drawn, it’s hard to say if it’s normal or not.” Tr. at 350. As a result,\nhe “usually [doesn’t] rely on lactates very much[.]” Tr. at 350.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman elaborated that he had seen the elevated biochemistries—\nspecifically, the elevated CK and AST—in other patients with symptoms similar to A.A.’s\nand suspected that she had mitochondrial dysfunction. 78 Tr. at 310. In the past he had\nseen approximately 10 to 12 patients with such profiles and treated many of them “in a\nsimilar fashion.” Tr. at 311. That is, he “start[ed] with carnitine, then [obtained] further\nstudies, and then [progressed to] using a more complete mitochondrial cocktail of\nvitamins.” Tr. at 311. Doctor Zimmerman stated that most of the patients, “in various\ndegrees,” had a positive response to the treatment. Tr. at 311.\n\n        When Dr. Zimmerman next saw A.A., it was at an unscheduled urgent visit on\nJanuary 22, 2003. 79 Tr. at 312. He recalled that “she had had four generalized tonic-\nclonic seizures over the . . . previous several weeks, since starting on the carnitine.” Tr.\nat 312. He suspected that “the seizures were stimulated by the carnitine, but [also]\nassumed that she probably had an underlying predisposition to have seizures because\nof autism.” Tr. at 312. Doctor Zimmerman asked A.A.’s parents “to discontinue the\ncarnitine” and bring her in for a visit. Tr. at 312. His plan following examination was to\nstart A.A. on Depakote and order a repeat EEG after six weeks. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15. He\nalso made a referral to Dr. Kelley “for further evaluation of a metabolic disorder. Tr. at\n313.\n\n        A.A. returned for a follow-up with Dr. Zimmerman on March 3, 2003, at which\ntime she appeared to be doing well. 80 Tr. at 313. Although the Depakote “seemed to\ninduce irritability,” she had only one additional seizure, which occurred after “she had\nbeen sleep-deprived.” Tr. at 314. As for her biochemistries, she had “elevated alanine\nto lysine ratio on an earlier study, normal on repeat; AST and CK were both elevated on\ntwo occasions; and the genetic testing was normal.” Tr. at 314. At this time, A.A. had\nnot yet seen Dr. Kelley, so Dr. Zimmerman discussed her case with him and asked that\nhe see her earlier due to his “concern about mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at 314.\n\n        On April 8, 2003, Dr. Kelley saw A.A. for an initial consultation at his metabolism\nclinic. Doctor Zimmerman was asked to review Dr. Kelley’s consultation report. 81 In\nresponse to questioning, Dr. Zimmerman stated that the report showed Dr. Kelley\n\n78\n  Doctor Zimmerman stated that he was referring particularly to the child discussed in the Poling article.\nSee Poling, Pet. Ex. 25A.\n79\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15.\n80\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 13.\n81\n     Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 3-7.\n\n\n                                                    51\n\f“found that [A.A.] had mitochondrial involvement and recommended . . . treatment with a\nvitamin regimen”—a “mitochondrial cocktail.”82 Tr. at 315. She was also restarted on\nCarnitor (L-carnitine), but at a lower dosage. Tr. at 315. Doctor Zimmerman explained\nthat L-carnitine “increases Complex I activity” and the various other vitamins “increase[]\nelectron transport chain activity.” Tr. at 315.\n\n       In response to questions regarding the cocktail, Dr. Zimmerman stated that he\nhas ordered the mitochondrial cocktail in his practice with the expectation that he would\n“see considerable improvement in the . . . child’s functioning.” Tr. at 317. He would\nspecifically watch for “[i]mproved developmental milestones and activity.” He recalled\nthat he was “concerned about the carnitine” in A.A.’s particular case, “but starting her\nback . . . did not seem to cause problems[;] . . . she responded rather well.” Tr. at 317.\n\n       A.A. returned for a follow-up with Dr. Zimmerman on July 14, 2003, a few days\nshy of her fourth birthday. 83 He characterized her as “doing remarkably well.” Tr. at\n318. He recalled that she had “responded to the cocktail, the parents were pleased,\nand she was sustaining eye contact; was more interactive, though briefly; seemed to\nplay with imagination . . . ; and was using single words, word combination[s]. Tr. at 318;\nsee also Tr. at 373-74 (redirect). She also had improved sleep. Tr. at 318. With regard\nto her seizures, he noted that he “had switched her medication from Depakote to\nTegretol based on the fact that Depakote seemed to be activating her in a negative way,\nand I felt she would respond better to Tegretol at that point, since her seizures were\ncontrolled.” Tr. at 318.\n\n       In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman explained that Depakote and\nTegretol both have side effects, which vary by individual; however, based on his own\nexperience, Depakote seems to cause “activation”—screaming, irritability. Tr. at 359.\nTegretol, on the other hand, “will often have a calming effect on adverse behaviors.” Tr.\nat 360. Doctor Zimmerman stated that in A.A.’s case he “assume[d the improvement]\nwas due to the Tegretol or at least withdrawing . . . the Depakote.” Tr. at 360.\n\n      Doctor Zimmerman stated that he continued to evaluate A.A. and that she\nprogressively “improve[d] over the years.” Tr. at 319. In his opinion, her positive\nresponse to the vitamin cocktail was “an indication” that A.A. “more likely than not” had\n“an underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at 319. With regard to her seizures, the\nmedication was effective in preventing any further occurrences, and after two years A.A.\ndiscontinued the anti-seizure treatment without recurrence. Tr. at 319-20.\n\n        In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman stated that his experience and\nexpectations with regard to the effects of vitamin cocktails were personal and anecdotal.\nTr. at 356. He was not aware of any studies that have systematically looked at whether\n\n82\n  The vitamin cocktail was composed of coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, vitamin C, thiamine, and lipoic acid.\nPet. Ex. 6, p 7.\n83\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 1.\n\n\n                                                  52\n\fvitamin cocktails are an effective treatment for children with autism. Tr. at 356. He also\nacknowledged that most children with ASD diagnoses make some improvements over\ntime, especially with proven therapies, such as speech therapy and ABA therapy, both\nof which A.A. received. Tr. at 356-57.\n\n       At this juncture, Dr. Zimmerman’s testimony shifted to a discussion of his\nresearch and the connections he and others have made between mitochondrial\ndysfunction and autism. 84 Tr. at 320. Although he spoke knowledgeably in both these\nareas, he was unable to set forth a theory connecting vaccines to either mitochondrial\ndysfunction or autism. Indeed, he testified that he could not directly attribute autistic\nregression to the MMR immunization or any resulting inflammation. Tr. at 367.\n\n      His early research “revolved around neuroinflammation and microglial activation\nand basically immune studies in autism, looking for factors in the immune system that\nmight be involved in . . . autism.” Tr. at 320. He stated that there is indication that\ninflammation plays a role in the “autism process,” but the work in this area has produced\nfew definitive answers. Tr. at 320. It cannot be said “that in any one individual . . .\ninflammation is the cause of autism.” 85 Tr. at 321.\n\n       Regarding mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of autism, Dr. Zimmerman\nstated that he had “always considered [it a] possibility,” but that it was not until he “went\nto Kennedy Krieger” and began working with Dr. Kelley that his interest solidified. Tr. at\n321. He explained that “mitochondria have always been considered an important part\nof neurological disorders,” but unlike “known” mitochondrial diseases, such as “Kearns-\nSayre syndrome or MERRF 86 or MNGIE,” 87 which are degenerative conditions,\nmitochondrial involvement in autism appears to impact development. Tr. at 321-22. He\ncontinued:\n\n84\n  On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman clarified that he is not a geneticist, metabolic specialist, or\nexpert in mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 343.\n85\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman confirmed his opinion that inflammation is thought to\nplay a role in autism, but cannot be said to be its cause in any one individual. Tr. at 360. He explained\nthat his assertion was based on the findings of “microglial activation in all the postmortem samples”\nregardless of whether there was regression. Tr. at 360. Doctor Zimmerman was the coauthor of two\npapers on this topic: D. Vargas, et al., Neuroglial Activation and Neuroinflammation in the Brain of\nPatients with Autism, ANNALS NEUROL. 57(1): 67-81 (2005); D. Vargas, et al., Immunity, neuroglia and\nneuroinflammation in autism, INT’L REV. PSYCHIAT. 17(6): 485-95 (2005). Although these papers were not\nfiled in this case, they were extensively discussed in the OAP test cases. See, e.g., Snyder. 2009 WL\n332044, at *88. In summary, the papers demonstrated microglial activation, but indicated that it might be\nthe result of ASD, not the cause.\n86\n  MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers) syndrome is “a familial type of mitochondrial\nencephalopathy of maternal (mitochondrial) inheritance, characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and\nmitochondrial myopathy with ragged red fibers.” The syndrome “is usually caused by mutation within the\nmitochondrial gene encoding the tRNA specific for lysine.” DORLAND’S at 1838.\n87\n  MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy) is one of numerous encephalopathies\nassociated with mitochondrial abnormalities. DORLAND’S at 615.\n\n\n                                                    53\n\f        [ASD] is not a degenerative disease in the vast majority of patients. It is\n        not something that gets worse with age, although some patients don’t\n        progress. If they regress, [it] occurs before the age of three, and [is]\n        usually associated with this window of vulnerability[.] . . . [R]egressions\n        typically occur between 15 and 24 months of age when there are profound\n        changes in synaptic development taking place in the developing brain.\n\nTr. at 322.\n\n         He stated that researchers are coming to understand that “autism is a problem at\nthe synaptic level.” Tr. at 323. Although a number of brain regions are involved in\nautism, “the real problem is at the level of the connections, at the synapses,” which are\never-changing during development. Tr. at 323. He explained that unregulated synaptic\npruning during the early stages of brain growth is a likely cause of the regressions seen\nin some individuals during this period. Tr. at 322. The research in this area is unclear,\nthough, as to “whether it’s too much or too little” pruning, or something else that has\n“go[ne] awry.” Tr. at 322. Some researchers theorize an acceleration or “exaggeration”\nof the normal pruning process due to “inflammation, probably from many different\ncauses.” Tr. at 323. He noted that “relatively few” causes of regression are known, but\nthat “it is likely from a biologic standpoint that this is when and where the regression\ntakes place in the brain.” Tr. at 323; see also Tr. at 363-67 (court examination).\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman also discussed several research articles pertaining to\nmitochondrial dysfunction and autism. He stated that the articles, which were “primarily\nstudies [of the] postmortem brain [tissue] of people with autism at different ages,\ndemonstrate[d] differences in the autis[tic] brain with respect to mitochondrial function . .\n. , DNA mutations, and content of mitochondrial activity in different areas[.]” Tr. at 324.\n\n       In the first study, researchers compared the levels and activities of various\nmitochondrial proteins in the lateral temporal lobe 88 of autistic individuals and controls\nbetween two and 67 years of age. G. Tang, et al., Mitochondrial abnormalities in\ntemporal lobe of autistic brain, NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE, 54: 349-61 (2013), filed as\nPet. Ex. 65 [hereinafter “Tang, Pet. Ex. 65”]. The researchers confirmed previous\nfindings of “decrease[ed] protein expression and Complex I and IV enzyme activities in\nthe temporal cortex” of ASD patients. Id. at 350. Additionally, they found “decreased\nprotein levels of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2 and increased oxidative\nmtDNA damage in ASD patients aged 2-9 years.” Id. Other differences in the ASD\nbrain included altered mitochondrial dynamics due to an imbalance between fission and\nfusion proteins, and increased mitochondrial mass due to increased levels of\nmitochondrial membrane proteins. Id. The authors noted that “[m]any of these changes\nwere evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but\nwere less pronounced or absent in adult patients.” Id. at 349. The authors concluded\n\n88\n  The lateral temporal lobe is “involved in auditory processing [and] language and social perception,”\nareas “implicated in ASD-associated behaviors.” Tang, Pet. Ex. 65, at 350; see also Tr. at 329.\n\n\n                                                    54\n\fthat the study provided “evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox\nstatus are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial\ndysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.” Id.\n\n        In a second study, researchers compared the protein levels of various\nmitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain (“ETC”) complexes in different brain\nregions from individuals with autism and age-matched controls. A. Chauhan, et al.,\nBrain region-specific deficit in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes in\nchildren with autism, J. NEUROCHEM., 117: 209-20 (2011), filed as Pet. Ex. 69\n[hereinafter “Chauhan, Pet. Ex. 69”]. 89 The researchers found that “children with autism\nshowed a decrease in protein levels of ETC complexes in the cerebellum and the frontal\nand temporal cortices,” but no differences “in the occipital and parietal cortices.” Id. at\n210. The researchers noted with interest that when the data was analyzed “as a\nfunction of age, children with autism (4-10 years of age) but not adults with autism (14-\n39 years of age) showed lower protein levels of brain ETC complexes[.]” Id. This\nsuggested “that developmental mitochondrial abnormalities resulting in mitochondrial\ndysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormal energy metabolism may contribute to [the]\nautistic phenotype.” Id.\n\n       In response to questioning, Dr. Zimmerman stated that the “most important\nfinding” in these two studies was the “clear difference between younger and older brains\nwith respect to mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 324. He stated that the researchers’\nfindings mirrored his own experience with regard to the changes seen in certain clinical\nand laboratory measures as children age. Id. “I don’t find them after they’re . . . school-\nage, after five to ten.” Tr. at 324. Indeed, if he tested A.A. today, he would expect her\nresults to be different from those obtained years earlier. Tr. at 325. On this last point,\nDr. Zimmerman was asked on cross examination whether he “believe[d] she has a\ndisorder of mitochondrial metabolism anymore.” Tr. at 351. He stated, “if she does, it’s\ngoing to be difficult to find it.” Tr. at 351.\n\n        Doctor Zimmerman viewed these differences as indicative of “a developmental\nprocess” that is “probably genetically regulated.” Tr. at 325; see also Tr. at 363-67\n(court examination). He explained that mitochondrial abnormalities are “more\npronounced at the younger ages” due to “differences in gene expression” during\ndifferent stages of development. Tr. at 326. “The genes that we inherit may be the\nsame, but the way they’re expressed . . . varies from one month or year to the next[]”—\n“allow[ing] for growth and development.” Tr. at 326. This dynamic biochemical\nenvironment has made it difficult, however, to “nail down” the causes of autism, with\nmany remaining elusive. Tr. at 326. He endorsed the idea that a child’s particular\nautistic symptoms are determined by the state of his or her brain at the time an “insult\noccurs.” Tr. at 327. This is why “there’s so much heterogeneity . . . [in] children with\nautism”—“virtually no two children are the same who have that diagnosis.” Tr. at 327.\n\n\n89\n   The study was “the first to report on brain mitochondrial abnormalities in autism.” Chauhan, Pet. Ex. 69\nat 216.\n\n\n                                                    55\n\f        Doctor Zimmerman specifically referenced several portions of the Tang article he\nthought were noteworthy, including the researchers’ confirmation of earlier findings by\nChauhan that ETC abnormalities were more severe in ASD children than adult patients.\nTr. at 327 (citing Tang, Pet. Ex. 65, at 357-58). Also significant was Tang’s speculation\nthat ETC abnormalities “may be secondary to environmental stressors, including\naberrant calcium signaling, alterations in immune functions,[toxic compounds], or\noxidative stress.” Tr. at 332 (citing Tang, Pet. Ex. 65 at 358 (citing S.J. James, et al.,\nCellular and mitochondrial glutathione redox imbalance in lymphoblastoid cells derived\nfrom children with autism, FASEB J., 23:2374-83 (2009))).\n\n       When asked to elaborate on what the researchers’ statements indicated\nregarding potential causes of autism, Dr. Zimmerman stated:\n\n       Well, it’s a – it means that the – the mitochondrial dysfunction may be an\n       important underlying factor when other stresses take place. Inflammation,\n       we know that autism can occur after or with certain infections. We know,\n       at least in some cases, that it may be associated with immunizations.\n       Anything that causes stress for the – on the mitochondrial system, and if\n       the – if mitochondrial activity is less than sufficient to support synaptic\n       function when it occurs, it – the – the added stress of the environmental\n       stressor, as they describe it here, could be a variety of things.\n       ...\n       That added stress, combined with a deficient mitochondrial activity,\n       embarrasses the – the cells, and many of them shut down and causes\n       continuing dysfunction.\n\nTr. at 332-33.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman also expressed familiarity with the work of Dr. Jill James,\nwhose 2009 research was cited by Tang. Tr. at 333. In response to questioning, Dr.\nZimmerman briefly discussed James’s work as it related to the Tang article. Id. He\nstated that “her work on oxidative stress . . . demonstrated that there’s increased\noxidative stress in autism for a number of reasons, including abnormalities in\nglutathione and other factors. So, it’s an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at\n333. According to Dr. Zimmerman, glutathione is an important compound regulating\nmitochondrial function. Tr. at 334. It is an antioxidant that “scavenges oxidative stress\nradicals,” which “damage membranes.” Id. He stated that the vitamin cocktail that he\nprescribes to patients with mitochondrial problems is designed to reduce oxidative\nstress. Id. He further stated that his and Dr. James’s work could be considered\nmutually supportive. Tr. at 335.\n\n       With regard to the Chauhan article, Dr. Zimmerman briefly noted the studies’\nfindings that young children with autism had “[l]ower levels of Complexes III and V in the\ncerebellum; Complex I in the frontal cortex; and Complex II, III, and V in the temporal\ncortex” as compared to older children and adults with autism. Tr. at 340 (citing\nChauhan, Pet. Ex. 69 at 211-12). These findings were significant to Dr. Zimmerman\n\n\n                                            56\n\fbecause they were “consistent with [his] findings clinically that . . . differences are more\napparent in young children compared to older children and adults.” Tr. at 341.\n\n        In a third article discussed by Dr. Zimmerman, researchers studied the\n“expression of 84 genes related to diverse functions of mitochondria, including\nbiogenesis, transport, translocation and apoptosis” in the postmortem brain tissues of\nautism patients and controls. A. Anitha, et al., Brain region-specific altered expression\nand association of mitochondria-related genes in autism, MOLECULAR AUTISM, 3:1-12\n(2012), filed as Pet. Ex. 66 [hereinafter “Anitha, Pet. Ex. 66”], at 1. They also studied\nthe associations of certain genes with autism. The researchers examined brain tissues\nfrom the anterior cingulate gyrus, motor cortex, and thalamus, and found that “[s]everal\ngenes showed brain region-specific expression alterations in autism patients compared\nto controls.” Id. at 1. For example, some genes showed “consistently reduced\nexpression” in autism patients. Id. Other genes showed an association with autism in\nsome samples. Id. The researchers concluded that the “[d]ysfunction of these genes\ncould lead to defects in mitochondrial activities, including energy metabolism, thus\naugmenting and disseminating several brain abnormalities related to autism. Id. at 10.\nSignificantly, they conceded that it was not clear if mitochondrial dysfunction “is the\ncause or effect of autism,” noting that “ASD patients have often been found to manifest\nbiochemical or neuropathological traits linked with altered mitochondrial function.” Id. at\n9.\n\n       In response to questioning, Dr. Zimmerman explained that the brain regions\nexamined by the researchers—the anterior cingulate gyrus, motor cortex, and\nthalamus—are thought to be areas from which autistic symptoms can arise. Tr. at 335-\n36. He stated that the cingulate gyrus is “an important area, because it integrates social\nand language and frontal lobe activity, and it’s very much affected in autism.” Tr. at\n335. He also noted that it was one of the areas he “studied extensively” in his work on\nmicroglial activation. Tr. at 335. The motor cortex, on the other hand, “is generally\nunaffected in autism compared to other areas.” Tr. at 335. Finally, the thalamus “is an\nimportant sensory way station” that “integrates sensory inputs and sends fibers out to\ndifferent areas of the brain.” Tr. at 335-36. He cautioned, however, that linking the\nsensory issues seen in autism “directly to the thalamus” would be incorrect—“they’re\nprobably widespread in the brain.” Tr. at 336.\n\n       The study was noteworthy to Dr. Zimmerman because it showed differences in\ngene expression in the studied regions of the brain. Tr. at 336. The findings were\nimportant because abnormal gene expression results in changes—increases or\ndecreases—in the production of proteins critical to proper cell function and energy\nmetabolism, which is especially crucial during early development when the brain is\ngrowing and making connections. Tr. at 336-38. For example, “in the temporal lobe, if\nyour mitochondrial function is decreased at a critical age,” the cells in that area will be\nless able to respond “when an insult occurs.” Tr. at 338. He emphasized that the\ntemporal lobe is very sensitive to insults, especially in the context of mitochondrial\ndysfunction. Tr. at 338.\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\f        The final article discussed by Dr. Zimmerman studied gene dysregulation in\nautism. M.R. Ginsberg, et al., Brain Transcriptional and Epigenetic Associations with\nAutism, PLOS ONE, 7(9):e44736 (2012), filed as Pet. Ex. 67 [hereinafter “Ginsberg, Pet.\nEx. 67”]. The researchers analyzed cerebellar and occipital brain tissues from\nidiopathic autistic patients and controls. Id. at 1. They identified “[n]o changes in DNA\nmethylation . . . in autistic brain but [found] gene expression abnormalities in two areas\nof metabolism [.]” Id. Specifically, the researchers found “down-regulation of genes of\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of protein translation[,]” as well as\n“associations between specific behavioral domains of autism and specific brain gene\nexpression modules related to myelin/myelination, inflammation/immune response and\npurinergic signaling.” Id. According to the researchers, their work highlighted “two\nlargely unrecognized molecular pathophysiological themes in autism and suggest[ed]\ndiffering molecular bases for autism behavioral endophenotypes.” Id.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman had little to say about this article; however, in response to\nquestioning he attempted to explain its significance. He stated:\n\n          The important thing here is that they find differences in genes that don’t –\n          they don’t find the differences in the occipital brain tissue . . . compared to\n          the cerebellum. The cerebellum is another area of involvement in autism,\n          whereas we look at the occipital region of the brain as being relatively\n          uninvolved, unaffected.\n\nTr. at 338-39. He emphasized that this study supported an earlier point he had made:\nthat the brain is not uniformly affected by autism—that “[d]ifferent regions of the brain\ncan be differentially affected.” Tr. at 339.\n\n          2. Doctor Kelley.\n\n       Of the four experts that testified, Dr. Kelley’s testimony was the most challenging\nand least persuasive. The challenge came not from the difficult subject matter, but from\nDr. Kelley’s inability to clearly explain his methods and theories. As shown below, his\ntestimony was littered with confusing tangents, unfocused narrative, and half-answered\nquestions. His testimony was more poorly supported by published studies than that of\nthe other witnesses, and in many cases the basis for his opinions were essentially\n“because I say so.”\n\n       In his expert report, Dr. Kelley opined that A.A.’s history of acute regression,\npersisting neurological deficits, and biochemical abnormalities, were “compatible” with a\n“diagnosis of an inborn error 90 of mitochondrial energy metabolism”—specifically, a\nfunctional complex I deficiency. Pet. Ex. 23 at 2. Of particular significance to his\nopinion were test results obtained by Dr. Zimmerman, which showed “increased plasma\nlevels of alanine and glycine, an increased AST to ALT ratio, a mildly increased creatine\nkinase level, electrolyte evidence of a metabolic acidosis, and a mildly increased blood\n\n90\n     He stated that the causative mutation had not been identified. Pet. Ex. 28 at 4.\n\n\n                                                       58\n\flactate level.” 91 Id. These results, together with A.A.’s history and clinical presentation,\nwere “convincing” evidence of “a primary or secondary mitochondrial disorder.” 92 Id.\n\n        Doctor Kelley elaborated that, in his experience “a combined increase in the\nplasma levels of alanine and glycine in a child with other clinical and biochemical signs\nof mitochondrial dysfunction and regressive autism always proves on muscle biopsy to\nbe a deficiency of complex I or complex I + III.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 2 (citing J. Weissman, et\nal., Mitochondrial Disease in Autism Spectrum Disorder Patients: A Cohort Analysis,\nPLoS ONE, 3 (11): e3815 (2008), filed as Pet. Ex. 28 [hereinafter “Weissman, Pet. Ex.\n28”]). Indeed, this finding is so consistent that he no longer orders “muscle biopsies for\ndiagnosis of suspected mitochondrial disease.” Id.; see also Tr. at 193; 275-78.\nAdditionally, Dr. Kelley viewed A.A.’s positive response to treatment with L-carnitine 93\nand other elements of the mitochondrial vitamin cocktail as supportive of the complex I\ndiagnosis. Id. at 2, 4. He also stated that his analysis of A.A.’s amino acid profile\nshowed her “profile [to be] the same as [that found] in most other children with\nregressive autism.” Id. at 2 (citing Pet. Ex. 23A).\n\n         Doctor Kelley then offered his theory of “how a child with a mitochondrial disorder\ncould be asymptomatic and developing normally for the first 15 months and then\nregress to a state of autism shortly after receiving an MMR vaccination.” Pet. Ex. 23 at\n2-3. He explained that his clinical work at the Kennedy Krieger Institute led him to the\ndiscovery of “mitochondrial autism.” 94 Id. at 3. According to Dr. Kelley, children who\nhave this “etiologically heterogeneous clinical disorder typically appear to be normal for\ntheir first 12 months or more before a viral illness or other stress[,] such as, rarely, an\nimmunization, provides the critical metabolic stress that sufficiently compromises energy\nmetabolism in the brain to precipitate acute or subacute cognitive and motor losses.” Id.\n\n\n91\n  He noted that genetic testing was negative for identifiable genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder,\nincluding Fragile X testing, Rett syndrome mutation analysis, and urinary organic acid analysis. Pet. Ex.\n23 at 2.\n92\n  At hearing, Dr. Kelley was asked to define primary and secondary mitochondrial disease. He stated\nthat primary mitochondrial disease involves a “primary genetic defect in some component of the\nmitochondrion;” he did not clearly define secondary mitochondrial disease, implying that only deficits in\nmitochondrial DNA could be considered primary defects. Tr. at 182-83. However, authoritative research\nhas shown that defects in nuclear DNA also cause mitochondrial problems. See R. Haas, et al., The In-\nDepth Evaluation of Suspected Mitochondrial Disease: The Mitochondrial Medicine Society’s Committee\non Diagnosis, MOL. GENET. METAB., 94 (1): 16-37 (2008), filed as Res. Ex. H [hereinafter “Haas, Res. Ex.\nH”], at 31) (stating that “[a]n estimated 75%-90% of pediatric primary mitochondrial disease results from\nnDNA mutations”).\n93\n  He noted that A.A.’s initial negative response of “increased excitability and agitation immediately after\nstarting carnitine” was not surprising, as “similar reactions occur in a subset of children with complex I\ndeficiency and can be taken as supporting evidence for that diagnosis.” Id. at 2.\n94\n  To aid in his explanation, Dr. Kelley appended a document entitled “Evaluation and Treatment of\nPatients with Autism and Mitochondrial Disease,” which contained his unpublished research on this topic.\nSee Pet. Ex. 23B.\n\n\n                                                     59\n\f       He hypothesized that the injury likely occurs during this “window of vulnerability”\nbecause of an increase in glutamate-receptor density in the frontal cortex, “which is\nestimated to peak at 18 months.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. According to Dr. Kelley, research\nhas shown that increased glutamate-receptor density raises “the risk for excitotoxic\nneuronal damage.” Id. He claimed that it is generally accepted that “any decrease in\nmitochondrial ATP synthesis capacity increases the sensitivity to glutamate\nexcitotoxicity.” 95 Id. (citing A. Novelli, et al., Glutamate becomes neurotoxic via the N-\nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor when intracellular energy levels are reduced, BRAIN RES.,\n451: 205-12 (1988), filed as Pet. Ex. 41 [hereinafter “Henneberry, 96 Pet. Ex. 41]). As a\nconsequence, children with “preexisting but otherwise asymptomatic mitochondrial\ndysfunction [are at] an increased risk of brain injury with chance occurrence of certain\nfactors, such [as] mitochondria-impairing inflammatory stress, during the developmental\nstage of the frontal and prefrontal cortex”—the time frame “when glutamate NMDA [N-\nMethyl-D-aspartate] 97 receptors are at their highest density.” Id.\n\n         According to Dr. Kelley, “[a]n established principle of the pathophysiology of\nacute injury in many metabolic diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, is that the\nnormal cytokine surges and catabolic stress of even simple viral infections can cause\nacute and sometimes fatal metabolic deterioration. Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. Of the “various\ncytokines released during an infection, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [“TNF-α”] is known\nto impair mitochondrial function as a normal part of the immune response that primes\ncells for mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death when infected.” Id. He has found that\nthe course of deterioration in most patients with regressive autism caused by complex I\ndeficiency occurs “over days to weeks, often preceded in the parents’ recollection by a\nviral illness, ear infection, or similar infectious process.” Id. He noted, however, that in\nrare cases, “the regression follows within 48 hours of one or more immunizations, as\nillustrated by the now publicly known case of [child’s first name] Poling.” 98 Id. (citing\nPoling, Pet. Ex. 25A at 171). Doctor Kelley stated that the “most important fact linking\n[A.A.’s] deterioration to her MMR vaccination is that the peak level of TNF-alpha\nfollowing immunization with the measles component of the MMR is between 10 and 15\ndays.” Id. at 3 (citing I. Ovsyannikova, et al., Cytokine production patterns and antibody\n\n95\n  Excitotoxicity refers to the degree to which a given substance has a toxic excitatory effect on the\nnervous system. DORLAND’S at 653. An excitotoxin is any of a group of neurotoxic substances that are\nanalogous to glutamic acid and mimic its excitatory effects on neurons of the central nervous system\n(e.g., N-Methyl-D-aspartate). Id.\n96\n  In his report and subsequent testimony, Dr. Kelley referred to this article by the name of one of its co-\nauthors, R. Henneberry.\n97\n N-Methyl-D-aspartate is a neurotransmitter similar to glutamate, found in the central nervous system.\nDORLAND’S at 1152.\n98\n   Doctor Kelley speculated that the regression the Poling child experienced within 48 hours was due to\nher receipt of “several killed-virus vaccines, which can induce immediate inflammatory responses\nbecause of previous immunizations with the same vaccines.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. However, none of the\nlisted vaccines in Poling, Pet. Ex. 25A, were killed virus vaccines. Either Dr. Kelley misspoke, or he was\nsimply unaware of the nature of the relevant vaccines.\n\n\n                                                     60\n\fresponse to measles vaccine, VACCINE, 21: 3946-53 (2003), filed as Pet. Ex. 71\n[hereinafter “Poland, 99 Pet. Ex. 71”]).\n\n       Doctor Kelley acknowledged the “absence of an association between the MMR\nvaccine and autism in large epidemiological studies.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. He also stated\nthat “autistic regressions caused by the live attenuated MMR vaccine are rare events.”\nId. However, in his view, the lack of statistical support between vaccines and autistic\nregression was not evidence against vaccine causation, but simply an indication that\nthere are a “wide variety” of inflammatory factors that can precipitate a regression. Id.\n\n      In conclusion, Dr. Kelley reiterated his opinion that A.A. had “biochemical\nabnormalities diagnostic of an inborn error of mitochondrial metabolism, best\ncharacterized functionally as complex I deficiency, but with an as yet unidentified\ncausative mutation.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 4. He further opined, to a reasonable degree of\nmedical certainty, that the “MMR vaccination administered 1 to 2 weeks before the\nonset of [A.A.’s] autistic regression at age 15 months was the direct precipitant of her\nneurological injury, leaving her with a diagnosis of autism with minor neuromotor\nabnormalities.” Id. He emphasized, however, that A.A.’s “mitochondrial disorder is\ncongenital and was not ‘triggered’ by the MMR vaccination. Rather, the MMR\nvaccination was simply one of several factors contributing to a typical inflammation-\nmediated metabolic injury.” Id.\n\n       At hearing, Dr. Kelley testified consistent with his expert report. He began his\ntestimony with a brief summary of A.A.’s reported medical history 100 and his\ninvolvement with her treatment. He recounted that by the time of his initial evaluation,\nDr. Zimmerman had already commenced a partial workup, the results of which “raised\nthe suspicion” of abnormal mitochondrial function. Tr. at 142-43. He noted that Dr.\nZimmerman routinely screened his autistic patients for markers of mitochondrial\nfunction, as he was “aware of the association between mitochondrial abnormalities and\nautism.” Tr. at 143. The screening involved an analysis of certain amino acid and\nenzyme levels known to be markers for mitochondrial function. Tr. at 142-4 3. The\ntesting looked for disturbances in these markers. Tr. at 143.\n\n       As an overview, Dr. Kelley explained that mitochondria are double-membraned\nsubcellular units that exist within nearly all cells of the body. Tr. at 145, 155. Their\nprimary function is energy metabolism—they convert food into energy. Tr. at 145. This\nconversion is accomplished through a process called the citric acid cycle, also known as\nthe “Krebs Cycle.” Tr. at 146, 154; see also Trial Ex. 4. He stated that food molecules,\nsuch as fatty acids and glucose, are converted into acetyl-CoA, which is then combined\nwith oxaloacetate to make citrate. Tr. at 148. Citrate is subsequently broken down in a\n99\n  The parties referred to this as the “Poland” article due to their hesitation at mispronouncing Dr.\nOvsyannikova’s name. Poland is the name of one of the other authors. To avoid confusion, I will cite to it\nas “Poland” as well.\n100\n   Doctor Kelley’s summary did not differ in any important respect from that previously testified to by Mr.\nAllen, Ms. Edick, and Dr. Zimmerman, and will therefore not be detailed here.\n\n\n                                                     61\n\fseries of steps wherein electrons and protons are extracted for addition to other\nmolecules. Tr. at 148-49. In this pathway, variously known as the “electron transport\nchain” and “respiratory chain,” electrons are combined with adenosine diphosphate\n(“ADP”) to produce adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”), the basic energy currency of the\ncell. Tr. at 149-50. The process of transforming ADP to ATP is called oxidative\nphosphorylation, also known as “OXPHOS.” Tr. at 154. Dr. Kelley explained that the\nelectron transport chain consists of a series of five protein complexes, 101 each\ncomposed of numerous smaller protein subunits, 102 some of which are encoded by the\nmitochondrial genome, but mostly by the nuclear genome. Tr. at 149. He stated that\n“most mitochondrial disease . . . relates to dysfunction in the electron transport chain.”\nTr. at 149, 153.\n\n        In addition to fatty acids and glucose, proteins are also processed through the\ncitric acid cycle. Tr. at 150. However, instead of generating acetyl-CoA, proteins are\nbroken down into their component amino acids or converted into intermediates in the\ncycle. Tr. at 150. Doctor Kelley explained that abnormal levels of certain plasma amino\nacids can be an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction, which is why amino acid testing,\nsuch as that performed by Dr. Zimmerman, is used for screening for mitochondrial\ndisease. Tr. at 150.\n\n        Doctor Kelley discussed the significance of pyruvate, lactate, and alanine as\nindicators for metabolic functioning. Tr. at 155. Before entering the citric acid cycle,\nglucose must first be converted to pyruvate through a pathway known as glycolysis.\nPyruvate is subsequently converted to acetyl-CoA or oxaloacetate for use in the citric\nacid cycle. Tr. at 148. Doctor Kelley explained that because of its role, pyruvate would\nbe a valuable measure of mitochondrial function; unfortunately, it is a very unstable\ncompound not easily or accurately measured. 103 Tr. at 155. Researchers have instead\nlooked to lactate and alanine as proxies for pyruvate because they are in equilibrium.\nId. However, because lactate is subject to artifacts in collection, “many people in the\nfield have adopted using alanine as a proxy for pyruvate at the same time they measure\nlactate.” Tr. at 155-56; see also Tr. at 169. Alanine is a stable amino acid in “very close\nequilibrium with pyruvate.” Tr. at 155.\n101\n    The electron transport chain is composed of five complexes, designated with Roman numerals (I-V).\nEach complex has a defined role in the metabolism of food molecules and the production of ATP. The\ncitric acid cycle is associated with Complex II. Tr. at 151-54.\n102\n      Doctor Kelley estimated that Complex I, for example, has more than 40 protein subunits. Tr. at 149.\n103\n    Doctor Kelley stated that pyruvate “is very, very difficult to measure except in a research laboratory.”\nTr. at 169. I note that I have frequently seen laboratory reports in Vaccine Act cases at least purporting to\nmeasure pyruvate or, more often, a pyruvate/lactate ratio, and that the ratio is commonly used as a\ndiagnostic criterion in several of the most commonly used diagnostic systems. See, e.g., E. Walker, et\nal., Respiratory Chain Encephalopmyopathies: A Diagnostic Classification, Eur. Neurol., 36: 260-67\n(1996) at 262, filed as Res. Ex. T [hereinafter “Walker, Res. Ex. T”]; E. Morava, et al., Mitochondrial\ndisease criteria: Diagnostic applications in children, Neurol., 67: 1823-26 (2006) at Table C,II, filed as\nRes. Ex. U [hereinafter “Morava, Res. Ex. U”]; F. Bernier, et al., Diagnostic criteria for respiratory chain\ndisorders in adults and children, Neurology, 59: 1406-11 (2002) at 1409, filed as Res. Ex. V [hereinafter\n“Bernier, Res. Ex. V”].\n\n\n                                                      62\n\f        Additionally, Dr. Kelley emphasized the importance of the amino acid proline,\nwhich “most biochemists know is a . . . marker for lactate.” Tr. at 167; see also Tr. at\n187-89 (direct); 665-68 (court examination). He analogized proline levels to the function\nof hemoglobin A1c in measuring average blood glucose levels over time. 104 Tr. at 167,\n188. He explained that similar to hemoglobin A1c, proline levels, measured from a\nstandardized collection, can show whether lactate was increased during a previous,\nalbeit shorter, period. 105 Tr. at 168, 188.\n\n        According to Dr. Kelley, glycine is also an important indicator of mitochondrial\nfunction. Tr. at 169. Based on observation, he has learned that glycine levels are\n“virtually always increased” in patients who have a Complex I deficiency diagnosed with\nmuscle biopsy. Tr. at 169. He attempted to explain; however, the result was less than\nclear:\n\n        When I use the term [Complex I deficiency] clinically, I mean a relative\n        impair – a relative block in the system at Complex I, which is where\n        pyruvate is oxidized. So if you have anything that impairs Complex I,\n        either a primary lesion in Complex I or a decrease in mitochondrial protein\n        synthesis, because Complex I is a rate-limiting step, if one decreases the\n        amount of mitochondrial protein overall, the first sign of a problem is a\n        block at Complex I[.] . . . [A]lanine goes up and glycine goes up[.] . . . It’s\n        not entirely known why; it’s more observational.\n\n               But one of the main systems for metabolizing glycine directly\n        connects with Complex I. So, the speculation is that [glycine] is high\n        because it – you know, to get impairing pyruvate dehydrogenase’s\n        function impaired Complex I, impaired Complex I function impairs the\n        glycine cleavage enzyme, as it’s called.\n\nTr. at 169.\n\n        Doctor Kelley summarized that “the point [of] looking at the amino acids . . . is not\nso much to make a specific diagnosis, but to [ask] what’s wrong with the\nmitochondrion?” Tr. at 157. He noted that not every mitochondrial disease disturbs\ncitric acid cycle function, but most interfere in some way. Tr. at 157. Thus, “particular\ndisturbances” in amino acid levels can provide insight into where the metabolic process\nis not working properly and enable treatment. Tr. at 157. Doctor Kelley indicated that it\n\n\n\n104\n   Hemoglobin A1c is a glycosylated form of hemoglobin. Tr. at 187. It reflects mean levels of blood\nglucose over approximately the preceding three month period. Tr. at 188.\n105\n  In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley stated that the length of the measurement is “not anywhere\nnear as long as hemoglobin A1c [, but] it’s a surrogate for a phenomena that you would like to be able to\nmeasure on an hourly basis, but you can’t.” Tr. at 667.\n\n\n                                                    63\n\fwas possible to determine where a block was occurring based on the amino acid profile\nand the given symptoms. 106 Tr. at 158.\n\n       Doctor Kelley then turned to A.A.’s amino acid profile, contained in Pet. Ex.\n23A, 107 and his interpretation of the results. Tr. at 159. As a preface to the discussion,\nhe stated that his method of analysis was “an elaboration on what many people do”—\nonly taken “a couple steps further.” Tr. at 159.\n\n        The profile was displayed in the form of a spreadsheet, with numerous columns\nand rows filled with data. The first column listed various amino acids of biological\nsignificance in the diagnosis of disease—30 in total. Tr. at 623. This was followed by a\ncolumn of “range” values for each amino acid. Doctor Kelley stated that the ranges\nwere found in a “paper from many years ago” where the authors “simply took a lot of\namino acid samples from their clinical service, measured these ranges and published\nthem in . . . a manual for metabolic diagnosis.” 108 Tr. at 174; see also Tr. at 623; 628-\n29 (redirect); 662-65 (court examination).\n\n        The next column displayed “mean” values, which Dr. Kelley “determined and\nrecalculated” using historical data from 100 samples he collected at his laboratory. 109\nTr. at 162, 176-77; see also Tr. at 624-25; 627-28 (redirect); 662-65 (court examination).\nHe noted that the samples were all taken following a four-hour fast, the significance of\nwhich he discussed later in his testimony. Tr. at 161, 177; see also Tr. at 624-25\n(redirect).\n\n      Adjacent to these initial columns were two columns of A.A.’s “amino acid data”\nobtained from testing performed on February 14, 2002, at KKI [the “KKI test”], and on\n\n106\n   As an example, Dr. Kelley discussed Barth syndrome, a genetic X-linked metabolic condition that\ncauses boys to develop, among other things, cardiomyopathy. Tr. at 158; see also Tr. at 192. He stated\nthat patients with this condition have extremely low levels of the amino acid arginine, which interferes with\ntheir ability to produce sufficient muscle protein. Tr. at 158. When he studied this disorder, Dr. Kelley\nhypothesized that a block existed at a certain enzyme; when he gave the children arginine, “it cure[d] the\nheart disease.” Tr. at 159. “So that’s . . . one of the more good examples of how one can look at the\namino acids and learn a lot about mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 159.\n107\n      Also filed as Trial Ex. 5.\n108\n   This paper was not submitted as an exhibit in this case. Doctor Kelley elaborated that he continues to\nuse these traditional ranges because he is “not at the point yet of publishing” his own range values. Tr. at\n175. He still needs to “go[] through all the documentation to say that . . . [his] new values are valid.” Id.\nDoctor Kelley stated that the traditional ranges were not based on samples obtained after a four-hour fast.\nTr. at 629.\n109\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley stated that the historical data he used was not publicly available for\nreview or verification. Tr. at 654-55. He stated that all of the samples were collected from children with\ndevelopmental problems; their diagnoses, however, were believed to have no effect on biochemistry. Tr.\nat 653-54. In response to another question, Dr. Kelley stated that he had not yet generated ranges for\nthe mean values because he “wanted to get up to 200” samples; however he promised that “the data are\nthere” and he could “fill them up on a spreadsheet now.” Tr. at 655.\n\n\n                                                     64\n\fAugust 21, 2002, by Quest [the “Quest test”], an independent commercial laboratory. 110\nTr. at 161; see also Tr. at 631 (redirect). The numbers represented the raw data\nobtained from the testing. Tr. at 631. These columns were followed by a set of\ncolumns containing “ratios to mean” values for the amino acid data. Doctor Kelley\nexplained that the ratio to mean for each result was calculated by dividing a given amino\nacid value by the corresponding mean value. Tr. at 162. For instance, the proline value\nfrom the KKI test was 137 and the related mean value was 161, so “137 divided by 161\nis .85,” which was the ratio to mean for that test result. Tr. at 162; see also Tr. at 632-\n35 (redirect).\n\n         The final set of columns contained “normalized ratios to mean” 111 values, which\nwere a key component of his analysis. Unfortunately, Dr. Kelley had significant difficulty\nelucidating how these values were calculated. See Tr. at 159-60; 165-67; 635-45. He\nbegan that it is common practice to use the ratios of certain amino acids as supportive\nevidence of a mitochondrial diagnosis. Tr. at 159-60. As an example, he noted that\nincreased pyruvate levels (or alanine as a proxy for pyruvate) relative to other “index”\namino acids, 112 such as lysine or tyrosine, is suggestive of a mitochondrial problem. 113\nTr. at 159-60. His method of analysis, he explained, takes “that concept and expand[s]\nit to involve . . . other amino acids, because each amino acid has some flaw in being\nused as an index, alanine to lysine, alanine to tyrosine.” Tr. at 160. He continued:\n\n        Each of those ratios has some pitfalls. So, we average out the ratios by\n        looking at the set of amino acids that have very few artifacts built into them\n        or are subject to very few artifacts of collection or metabolism and just\n        expand that ratio. And we simply index that to a value of one. So, we do\n        a calculation to say that if everything were exactly as it should be, the ratio\n        in this final column should be one and the – there are, I’d say, multiple\n        pathways that are related to the mitochondrial function, which can throw\n        these ratios off.\n\nTr. at 160; see also Tr. at 635-45 (redirect).\n\n       Doctor Kelley emphasized the importance of a four-hour fasting blood sample—\n“plus or minus”—to obtain accurate results. Tr. at 162, 164; see also Tr. at 626-27\n(redirect). He explained that after a meal, “amino acid levels from protein go up and\n110\n   Doctor Kelley emphasized that although the results were obtained from different laboratories, “amino\nacid quantitation is quite standardized” and “very reproducible from laboratory to laboratory.” Tr. at 161.\n111\n   Doctor Kelley stated that “normalized ratios” are ratios “divided by a number to bring them back to a\ncertain standard.” Tr. at 635.\n112\n   He indicated that the index amino acids are selected because they are known to be “largely unaffected\nby problems in the citric acid cycle or in mitochondrion, with some exceptions.” Tr. at 159.\n113\n   According to Dr. Kelley, “it’s stated, for example, in the literature that an alanine to lysine ratio greater\nthan three is evidence of a mitochondrial problem, not diagnostic, but supportive evidence of that\ndiagnosis.” Tr. at 159-60.\n\n\n                                                       65\n\fthey go up in an unpredictable way based on . . . what someone eats.” Tr. at 163.\nWhen he orders biochemical testing, he instructs that the patient fast for between four\nand five hours. Tr. at 629. He has determined this time frame to be the “ideal range”\nbecause “everything’s back to baseline” by that point—“all [of] the [amino acid] ratios\nare relatively constant.” Tr. at 163-64; see also Tr. at 177-79 (direct); 630-31 (redirect).\nHe stated that he did not know the exact amount of time A.A. fasted for the KKI test, but\nhe could “tell that it was more than four hours” based on the lower-than-expected levels\nof certain amino acids. Tr. at 163; see also Tr. at 177-79 (direct). The Quest test,\nhowever, was performed “with very specific instructions to fast for four hours.” 114 Tr. at\n161; see also Tr. at 659 (cross).\n\n       Doctor Kelley explained that he drew the conclusion about the KKI test by\ncomparing the amino acid values with the corresponding mean values. 115 He stated that\nthe test values were lower than the mean values, which indicated to him that A.A. had\nfasted for more than four hours. Tr. at 164, 177-78. To illustrate his point, he directed\nattention to specific results on the spreadsheet. He began with glutamic acid; however,\nthe KKI result was higher than the mean, while the Quest result was lower, which was\nopposite of what he wanted to show. Tr. at 164; see Pet. Ex. 23A. Doctor Kelley\nquickly moved on because “well, glutamic acid is not one of the ones that we used\nbecause it’s subject to artifacts.” Tr. at 164. He then pointed to the branched chain\namino acids, “which are pretty reliable.” Tr. at 164. The first result he noted was for\nvaline. In this instance, the KKI value was lower than the mean, but so was the Quest\nvalue—indeed, the Quest value was not only lower than the mean; it was lower than the\nKKI value. Tr. at 164. Eventually, he found results (isoleucine and leucine) to support\nhis point. Tr. at 164. “As I say, there’s a lot of variation, minor variation.” Tr. at 164-65.\n\n       Typical of his testimony as a whole, Dr. Kelley then launched into a meandering,\nconfusing, and completely unpersuasive elaboration of his unique insights and methods.\nTr. at 165-67. Immediately following the above-described explanation, he continued:\n\n        But the – when you average everything up, they’re – when you take an\n        average of all these ratios – so, this is a – each one of these is a ratio to\n        the mean. And for about 14 of these – of the amino acids that are not\n        subject to or have few things that influence their level other than the time\n        after a meal, which if you average all of those ratios, you find that the ratio\n        for sample one at KKI was .9 – it got cut off. It’s like .9 and the one here\n\n114\n   Doctor Kelley stated that he did not presume that his instructions were followed. Tr. at 659. He\nexplained that the values themselves were indicative of a four hour fast—he knows the values that certain\ncompounds should have at four hours fasting. Tr. at 660.\n115\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley was asked whether it was problematic to compare A.A.’s amino acid\nvalues, which were from a supposed non-fasting sample, against mean values generated from four-hour\nfasting samples. Tr. at 656-57. He replied that “generally” one would want to compare four-hour fasting\nsamples to other four-hour fasting samples; however, his calculations bring everything “back to some\nstandard.” Tr. at 657. He understood how the concept “may be a little foreign” to those “not used to\nstatistics.” Id.\n\n\n                                                   66\n\f        was, I think, 1.05 or something like that. .9, the ratios are all less – means\n        that the average ratio is less than one, which means that she’s gone\n        beyond the four-hour fasting point. The one that – from a physiologic\n        standpoint. It could have been four hours fasting, but physiologically, she\n        was beyond what we see in the average four-hour fasting sample. So, it’s\n        simply a way of being able to compare one amino acid sample to another\n        one, in a standardized way if the – if the – too many amino acid ratios are\n        too high or too many are too low, I, in effect, throw out the sample. I say I\n        can’t evaluate that. It has to be close to what we would predict for a four-\n        hour fasting sample. This is – I think a lot of my colleagues recognize this\n        is not standardized – or it’s not a standard approach, but it is – I’ve been\n        doing it for ten years or so and it’s a – it just makes the interpretation so\n        much simpler. 116\n\nTr. at 165; see also Tr. at 635-45 (redirect).\n\n        Despite the unconventional nature of his method, Dr. Kelley was confident that\nthe resulting data could be used “in a significant way for [A.A.] because we’re very\ncareful to standardize the conditions to produce the state where the amino acid levels in\nthe blood reflect the physiology of the mitochondrion and other things.” Tr. at 166. He\nexplained that this provides a “stable basis for comparison” so that he can “go through\nthe calculations.” Tr. at 166-67. Doctor Kelley did not explicitly state what “the\ncalculations” produced, but he seemed to be referring to the normalized ratios to mean\nvalues, which he indicated would all be “one” if he obtained “a perfectly normal sample\nof four hours fasting in the ideal child.” Tr. at 166-67. In passing, he also mentioned\nthat the range values for the normalized ratios to mean, noted on the spreadsheet as\n“0.8 to 1.2 (approx),” were based on 200 controls he had collected in his laboratory. Tr.\nat 167. Although the underlying data was not disclosed, Dr. Kelley assured that he has\n“the statistics [to] show that the normal range for most of these ratios is 0.8 to 1.2.” Tr.\nat 167; see also Tr. at 181.\n\n        Doctor Kelley then discussed the specific test results in A.A.’s profile that he\nviewed as indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction—particularly those for glycine,\nalanine, and proline. Tr. at 168-70. However, rather than focusing on the actual test\nvalues, which were often within the expected range, he emphasized the normalized\nratios to mean values that he derived using his unpublished methodology. 117 The actual\nvalues for glycine were normal for both tests (KKI and Quest), while the normalized\n\n116\n   Doctor Kelley stated that his approach was a “logical extension” of other established methodologies\nused to study metabolic disorders. Tr. at 647. He elaborated that his methods were “in effect, bringing\namino acid analysis up to date. It’s fallen far behind other methodologies in simply using normal ranges.\nAnd that’s rather primitive in the analysis of amino acids because of the difficulty of obtaining samples on\nchildren.” Tr. at 647.\n117\n  Doctor Kelley explained that he generally does not rely on the traditional range values in his analysis\nbecause they are established in “laboratories run by PhDs” who are not necessarily aware of\nphysiology—“they’re not clinicians.” Tr. at 172.\n\n\n                                                     67\n\fratios were both elevated. 118 Tr. at 170; Pet. Ex. 23A at 2. For alanine, the actual value\nwas normal for the KKI test, but significantly elevated for the Quest test; however, both\nnormalized ratios were elevated. 119 Id. Similarly, the actual value for proline was\nnormal for the KKI test, but elevated for the Quest test. Id. When he “normalized” the\nratios for proline, only the Quest test was elevated. 120 Id.\n\n         Doctor Kelley addressed these discordant results by reiterating the importance of\ncollecting blood samples under standardized conditions—especially the four-hour fast\nprotocol. Tr. at 170; see also Tr. at 644-46 (redirect). He attributed the apparently\nnormal results for the KKI test to A.A. having fasted well beyond the ideal time frame,\nmaking it an unreliable measure of mitochondrial function. Tr. at 168-70, 186. In\ncontrast, the Quest sample, which was collected under the stringent “ideal conditions”\ndirected by Dr. Kelley, showed “high proline, which means high lactate, [and] a high\nglycine and a high alanine that imply Complex I deficiency.” Tr. at 170. With that said,\nhe still found the normalized ratios for the KKI test to be “convincing” given that the\nglycine and alanine values were 5.6 and 4.4 standard deviations above normal,\nrespectively. 121 Tr. at 170. As a comparison, the normalized ratio for alanine from the\nQuest sample was “ten standard deviations above normal.” Tr. at 167; see also Tr. at\n181 (stating that the alanine value of 2.09 was “almost 11 standard deviations above\nnormal”).\n\n       According to Dr. Kelley, A.A.’s amino acid profile reflected the “classic pattern” of\na child with Complex I deficiency and regressive autism. Tr. at 178. He elaborated that\neither sample was “very suspicious” because glycine and alanine increased together\n“almost always, at least 90 percent of the time, . . . comes back as a Complex I\ndeficiency [on] a muscle biopsy.” 122 Tr. at 178-79; see also Tr. at 193-94.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Kelley stated that he uses the term “Complex I\ndeficiency” from a functional standpoint. Tr. at 237-38. He explained that “Complex I\ndeficiencies for most people mean[] a specific deficiency of [the] Complex I subunit, for\n\n118\n   The actual test values for glycine: KKI (291); Quest (292); range (87-323). The normalized ratio\nvalues for glycine: KKI (1.56); Quest (1.35); range (0.8-1.2). Pet. Ex. 23A at 2.\n119\n   The actual test values for alanine: KKI (379); Quest (634); range (136-440). The normalized ratio\nvalues for alanine: KKI (1.44); Quest (2.09); range (0.8-1.2).\n120\n    The actual test values for proline: KKI (137); Quest (282); range (51-271). The normalized ratio values\nfor proline: KKI (0.93); Quest (1.66); range (0.8-1.2).\n121\n   In response to questioning on cross examination, Dr. Kelley agreed that A.A.’s glycine levels on both\ntests were normal when evaluated against the traditional range values and became abnormal only when\nusing his own ratios. Tr. at 239-40.\n122\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley confirmed that his opinion regarding A.A.’s complex I deficiency was\nbased on the abnormalities seen in her profile, particularly the glycine and alanine values. Tr. at 238. He\nstated that the profile was “exactly what we see in an otherwise well-defined Complex I, based on\nstandard criteria, muscle biopsy, or a molecular diagnosis.” Tr. at 238.\n\n\n                                                    68\n\fexample, or a muscle biopsy showing a deficiency in Complex I.” Tr. at 238. He\ncontinued: “The studies I do show a pattern that correlates with those findings, even\nthough I can’t say and even though we know, theoretically, that abnormalities other than\nComplex I itself can cause that profile. So, I call it a Complex I profile.” Tr. at 238.\n\n       In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley stated that the normalized ratios to\nmean values for glycine and alanine on both tests were not necessarily diagnostic, but\nindicated a “very high likelihood” of Complex I deficiency. 123 Tr. at 180. Additionally, he\nstated that he would hold that opinion even if he had “just one sample” to evaluate. Tr.\nat 180. I noted that this was contrary to other diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial\ndiseases, which typically require more than one laboratory sample. 124 Tr. at 180.\nDoctor Kelley responded that multiple samples are unnecessary if collection is\nstandardized, because standardization eliminates the variability that necessitates\nnumerous samples. Tr. at 180-81.\n\n         I questioned Dr. Kelley about the frequency of discordant results from testing,\nspecifically, how often test results “would be suggestive, if not diagnostic, of a Complex\nI deficiency” from one lab and not another. Tr. at 181. In response he stated: “That will\nhappen[, but] . . . when one looks at the mean levels, they’re different – they’re obtained\nat different physiological states. One’s fasting, one’s not fasting. I don’t see a\ndiscrepancy if they’re collected at the same point of fasting.” Tr. at 181. He reiterated\nthat it is “very uncommon” to “see discordant results if they’re taken at the same level of\nfasting.” Tr. at 182; see also Tr. at 184-85.\n\n        After listening to Dr. Kelley explain his method and interpret the results, I asked\nhim how many other laboratories were using his system of analysis across the country.\nTr. at 172. He stated that he did not know if any laboratories were using it, but stated\nthat its “clinical utility” is “clear” to a number of clinicians. 125 Tr. at 173. He implied that\nthe lack of adoption by laboratories was due to his not having “had time to publish it.”\nTr. at 173. He lamented that it “takes a long time” to generate the data necessary “to\nconvince people.” Tr. at 173. Later in his testimony, Dr. Kelley stated that clinicians\nbecome convinced once he describes his method and shows them that the values for\n“proline, alanine and glycine were not normal” compared to “the other amino acids.” Tr.\nat 190. They ultimately find his method better “than the alanine-lysine ratio, which is\n\n\n123\n   Doctor Kelley later stated that taken together, the trio of normalized ratios to mean values for proline,\nglycine, and alanine from the Quest test were “in [his] view, diagnostic”—the “strength is in the numbers.”\nTr. at 187.\n124\n    See, e.g., N. Wolf and J. Smeitink, Mitochondrial disorders: A proposal for consensus diagnostic\ncriteria in infants and children, NEUROL., 59: 1402-05 (2002), filed as Court. Ex. 1 [hereinafter “Wolf and\nSmeitink, Court. Ex. 1”], at Suppl. Data (requiring at least three samples for evaluating lactate).\n125\n    On cross examination, Dr. Kelley was questioned about his method, particularly his use of normalized\nratios. Tr. at 239. He confirmed that other laboratories have not adopted his method and that he has not\npublished “how [he] got [the] ratios.” Tr. at 240-41. He clarified, though, that certain individuals within\nlaboratories have used the results of his analysis in their reports. Tr. at 240-41.\n\n                                                     69\n\fmore traditional, but . . . has many pitfalls to it.” 126 Tr. at 190. Indeed, “[o]ne could miss\na mitochondrial diagnosis just using that ratio.” 127 Tr. at 190.\n\n       Doctor Kelley discussed the treatment he ordered for A.A. based on her amino\nacid profile. Tr. at 194. He stated that the “first step” was to prescribe carnitine and “a\nstandard combination of antioxidants.” Tr. at 194-95; see also Tr. at 192-93. He\nexplained that carnitine is a vitamin-like compound that can be used to activate\nComplex I through its interaction with acetyl-CoA, a compound “very central to energy\nand metabolism.” Tr. at 195-96. He stated that for children like A.A., who are “right on\nthe edge,” carnitine can “activate Complex I and push [them] back [to stability]. [T]hat’s\nthe concept behind using carnitine.” Tr. at 196-97.\n\n       In response to questioning, Dr. Kelley elaborated on the meaning of “on the\nedge.” Tr. at 199-201. He stated that many children with mitochondrial disease or other\nmetabolic abnormalities “can be perfectly healthy and normal until they hit some stress,”\nwhich “puts a greater demand on the system” and they basically “fall apart.” Tr. at 200.\nHe explained that someone with normal Complex I activity can withstand a “certain\ndegree of impairment without seeing change whatsoever.” Tr. at 200. However,\nsomeone with lowered Complex I activity is “closer to the edge”—they are sensitive to\nadditional stress. Tr. at 200. The idea is to increase Complex I activity to move them\nback from the edge. Tr. at 200. Although it “doesn’t take away the disease entirely,” it\ncan provide them with some reserve to “withstand the daily stresses.” Tr. at 200. He\ncontinued:\n\n        So, again, . . . most children with regressive autism are . . . relatively\n        normal developmentally up to a year, and then some of the children will\n        develop regressive autism due to some stress – in the broadest sense of\n        the term “stress” – that in turn with a mitochondrial disorder or with\n        mitochondrial autism, as we call it, there are various stressors, usually an\n        infection, that they know what infections do to the mitochondria in terms of\n        lowering mitochondrial function and that is the added stress that can push\n        them over the edge and do the damage. 128\n\nTr. at 200-01.\n\n\n126\n    Doctor Kelley claimed that “[t]here’s literature published that talks about the alanine-lysine ratio, which\nis the same concept, but expanded to get rid of a lot of the artifacts.” Tr. at 190. He elaborated that “if\nsomeone understands amino acid physiology, this is not rocket science. This is very logical, very\nstraightforward.” Tr. at 191.\n127\n  Doctor Zimmerman considered this ratio in an early evaluation: “I note that she had normal quantitative\namino acids, including the alanine/lysine ratio.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n128\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley acknowledged that regression can occur without any\napparent stress. Tr. at 201. He stated, however, that some mitochondrial disorders were “much more\nsusceptible to stress” than others. Tr. at 201.\n\n\n                                                      70\n\f        With regard to the antioxidant component of A.A.’s treatment (i.e., the “vitamin\ncocktail”), Dr. Kelley explained that a “common phenomenon” in mitochondrial disease\nis free radical damage. Tr. at 202. He stated that a free radical is “basically an electron\ngone wild,” inflicting damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Tr. at 203. He\nstated that all mitochondria produce free radicals, but they also have a natural system\nfor trapping and neutralizing them. Tr. at 203. However, with certain functional\nimpairments, the system fails to work properly, resulting in increased free radicals. Tr.\nat 204. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, lipoic acid, and Coenzyme Q, can help\n“reverse” the damage done by free radicals. Tr. at 203-04. Doctor Kelley stated that\n“when the antioxidants are given, the abnormalities we measure in the citric acid cycle\ngradually go away, in addition to the change that occurred in Complex I with the\ncarnitine.” Tr. at 205. He recounted that in “some patients that we give carnitine, we\nsee some improvement biochemically and clinically, and then we add antioxidants and\nwe see further improvement. So, it’s a two-step treatment.” Tr. at 205. Doctor Kelley\nalso noted that A.A. was given thiamine and vitamin B5. Tr. at 208. He explained that\n“a subset of patients with Complex I deficiency” respond to thiamine, although it is not\nclear why; and vitamin B5 is thought to enhance the action of carnitine. Tr. at 208.\n\n        I questioned Dr. Kelley regarding the efficacy of vitamin cocktails in light of the\nlack of evidence showing that such treatments result in clinical improvement. Tr. at 205.\nHe responded that the reason most mitochondrial experts have not seen improvement\nis because their cocktail recipe is not properly balanced. Tr. at 207. He elaborated that\n“if you do vitamin E by itself, which some people do, it’s toxic. If you give Co-Q by itself,\nit can be toxic. You have to have the complete system activated, and very few people\ndo that.” Tr. at 207.\n\n        As to whether the vitamin cocktail was beneficial to A.A., Dr. Kelley stated that he\nhad “heard” she responded well, but conceded that he had not seen her for over 10\nyears, since 2002. 129 Tr. at 208-09. At the hearing, Dr. Kelley interacted with A.A. but\nfound it difficult to assess her progress, since he would be comparing “a child who was\njust a few years old to someone her age now.” Tr. at 208-09. He likened the\ncomparison to “apples and oranges.” Tr. at 209.\n\n       Doctor Kelley then returned to the subject of metabolic stress and how it could\nlead to an autistic regression in children with mitochondrial problems. In an unfocused\nnarrative, he attempted to discuss some of the many different “mechanisms” of injury\nthat can cause such deterioration. Tr. at 209-22. He eventually alighted on the theory\npresented in his expert report—that the inflammatory response produced by a stressor,\nsuch as an infection, a virus, or a vaccine, can cause neurological damage in children\nwith impaired mitochondrial function. Tr. at 216-17. According to Dr. Kelley, there is a\n“window of vulnerability” between the ages of 12 and 24 months, when children like A.A.\n\n\n129\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley stated that he did not perform any post-treatment\nbiochemical testing on A.A. to evaluate the cocktail’s effectiveness, although he has done such testing on\nother children in the past. Tr. at 665.\n\n\n                                                    71\n\fare highly vulnerable to the effects of metabolic stressors. 130 Tr. at 213-14. This\nvulnerability is largely due to increased glutamate NMDA receptor density in the\nforebrain during this period of development. 131 Tr. at 214. He also briefly discussed the\nrole cytokines in the inflammatory response—particularly, TNF-α, a cytokine that\ninduces apoptosis, or cell death. Tr. at 216-22. Doctor Kelley stated that in his clinical\nexperience, “if there is an identifiable event or identifiable time frame in which\nregression occurs, the factor that links it is inflammation.” Tr. at 217. In A.A.’s case, he\nsaw a “reasonable argument” for vaccine causation based on inflammation during the\nwindow of vulnerability. Tr. at 218; see also Tr. at 285-88 (redirect).\n\n        In response to questioning, Dr. Kelley indicated that inflammation from an\ninfection was different from that generated by a vaccine—it had a different cytokine\n“profile.” Tr. at 218-19. However, “correlations have not been made” regarding “what\ncombination of cytokines [is] most likely to impair mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 219.\n\n       Doctor Kelley stated that he recommends immunizations for children with\nmitochondrial disorders, unless extremely unstable. Tr. at 222-23; 651. However, as a\nprecaution he “pre-treats” such children with the asthma drug Singulair,” which “directly\nblocks the TNF-alpha system.” 132 Tr. at 223; see also Tr. at 651-52 (redirect). Although\nhe does not have any “hard data to prove that it works,” he stated that during the\nprevious 10 years none of his pre-treated patients experienced a deterioration of\nmitochondrial function. 133 Tr. at 223-25; see also Tr. at 660-62. He stated that before\nhe was comfortable clinically with the “idea of offering Singulair as a mechanism to\nprotect” he might have advised parents to “wait until two years,” because it is “very\nuncommon” to see a regression past that point.” 134 Tr. at 228. Now, all of his patients\nwith mitochondrial disease get vaccinations. Tr. at 228.\n\n130\n   The size of the “window” changed a few times. For example, in his report following his initial\nevaluation of A.A. on April 8, 2003, Dr. Kelley wrote that the period was “between 12 and 36 months.”\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 5 (emphasis added). In a July 14, 2003 letter exempting A.A. from further vaccinations he\nstated that the “window of greatest vulnerability for brain injury in children with [A.A.]’s type of metabolic\ndisorder” was “at least six years old.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 126 (emphasis added).\n131\n   Unfortunately, Dr. Kelley did not elaborate on this concept or discuss the two articles he referenced\nduring his testimony in any meaningful detail. Tr. at 213-17 (citing Henneberry, Pet. Ex. 41; M. Johnson,\net al., Neurobiology of Rett syndrome: a genetic disorder of synapse development, BRAIN DEV., 23 Suppl.\n1: S206-13 (2001), filed as Pet. Ex. 46 [hereinafter “Johnson, Pet. Ex. 46”]); see also Tr. at 287-88 (court\nexamination).\n132\n   According to Dr. Kelley, Singulair “partially blocks . . . the cytokine cascade[;] it’s thought to preserve\nimmunity to protect the child and, yet, . . . attenuate the inflammatory response that is generally\nrecognized in mitochondrial disease and other metabolic abnormalities.” Tr. at 652.\n133\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley stated that he does not perform antibody titers on the children to test\ntheir immune response. Tr. at 660. He acknowledged that the “non-effect” could be due to the\nvaccination not causing the harm in the first place. Tr. at 661-62.\n134\n   Doctor Kelley could not recall his recommendation for A.A. Tr. at 226-27. In a letter dated July 14,\n2003, Dr. Kelly excused A.A. from further vaccination due to her condition. The letter stated that A.A.\n“has autistic spectrum disorder and biochemical evidence of a mitochondrial disease.” It explained that\n\n                                                       72\n\f       Doctor Kelley was asked how many cases of regressive autism he has attributed\nto the MMR vaccine. Tr. at 225. He responded that he could remember only four cases\n“for sure.” Tr. at 225. He continued that when has made such attribution,\n\n        it’s usually in the window when the MMR is given and . . . the timing is\n        appropriate. Based on what is known about the immune response to the\n        MMR vaccine, the . . . cytokine response . . . peaks at about 14 days and\n        it’s – in contrast to a child like [child’s first name] Poling, who regressed\n        almost immediately when she was given a lot of inflammatory vaccines,\n        the few children that I’ve seen who have regressed with – based on\n        evidence that they’ve regressed with the MMR, it was at 10 to 14 days\n        after the immunization, which . . . [coincides with] the peak cytokine\n        response[.]\n\nTr. at 225; see also Tr. at 279-81 (redirect). He commented that it was “surprising” how\na live virus vaccine, which “is supposed to mimic infection” and stimulate the immune\nsystem “can cause such high levels of cytokines.” Tr. at 225; see also Tr. at 648\n(redirect). “Sometimes children get fevers, but it’s presumably not in the fever-\nproducing cytokines where the susceptibility occurs.” Tr. at 225-26.\n\n        At the end of his direct testimony, Dr. Kelley affirmed that it was his opinion that\nthe MMR vaccine substantially contributed to the onset of A.A.’s regressive autism. Tr.\nat 229. He stated that his opinion was largely based on the timing, which “makes sense\nin terms of the . . . pathophysiologic mechanism that we were beginning to develop at\nthat time.” Tr. at 229. He also stated that “she had clear signs of mitochondrial\ndysfunction.” Tr. at 229. He continued: “I felt . . . as I said in my report, that this is a\nvery good story . . . based on the timing and the known phenomenology of the immune\nsystem and mitochondrial interaction, this was a consistent story.” Tr. at 229. In his\nopinion, the probability was high that the vaccine “was contributory. I’ll put it that way at\nleast. So, that was my opinion at the time.” Tr. at 229.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Kelley clarified that he used the terms autism\nsecondary to mitochondrial disease, mitochondrial PDD, and mitochondrial autism\nsynonymously. Tr. at 236-37. He confirmed that “mitochondrial autism” is not a\nnationally or internationally recognized condition and is not used outside of the Kennedy\nKrieger Institute, but noted that the “association of mitochondrial disease with autism is\nquite well recognized.” Tr. at 237.\n\n      Doctor Kelley was cross-examined about various parts of his expert report. Tr. at\n241-42. He first was asked to explain what he meant when he stated that he had found\n\n“the physiological stress of a vaccine” can trigger the “onset of brain injury in children with mitochondrial\ndisease. . . as was the case for [A.A.] at the time of her MMR immunization.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 162. For this\nreason, it was recommended that A.A. not receive any further vaccines until she passed “the window of\ngreatest vulnerability for brain injury,” which in children with A.A.’s “type of metabolic disorder” is six years\nof age. Id.\n\n\n                                                       73\n\f“convincing biochemical and clinical evidence for a primary or secondary mitochondrial\ndisorder.” Tr. at 242. He stated that it was a “combination of things,” including the\namino acid profile, the increased creatine kinase, the lactate level, the AST-ALT ratio,\nand the other biochemical criteria that he discussed during the hearing. Tr. at 242. In\nresponse to continued questioning, Dr. Kelley acknowledged that A.A.’s plasma lactate\nlevel was only borderline and that her struggling during the test could have been the\ncause of the elevation. Tr. at 242-45 (citing Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 4, 19). He also confirmed\nthat he viewed the AST-ALT ratio as an indirect marker. Tr. at 245.\n\n       He was then asked about his citation to the Weissman paper [Pet. Ex. 28] as\nsupport for his assertion that “a combined increase in the plasma levels of alanine and\nglycine in a child with other clinical and biochemical signs of mitochondrial dysfunction\nand regressive autism always proves on muscle biopsy to be a deficiency of Complex I\nor Complex [I and] III.” Tr. at 246. Doctor Kelley was a co-author of the article. 135 Tr. at\n247. When pressed to show where he found support in the article for his assertion, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that was in the article.” Tr. at 247. Doctor Kelley conceded that\nhis statement about muscle biopsy was supported only by his own experience and not\non anything that has been published. Tr. at 248. He explained that he has had “maybe\nbetween half a dozen and ten patients who had a muscle biopsy, who [he] tested at\nsome point, found to have that amino acid abnormality, they correlated.” Tr. at 248. He\ncontinued: “So, the N was not enormous. It’s difficult to generate large Ns in that\nsetting, but the statement holds that it correlated.” Tr. at 248.\n\n        As for the “convincing clinical evidence” of a “mitochondrial disorder,” Dr. Kelley\npointed to A.A.’s regression “under an inflammatory event,” as well as her seizures and\n“some neuromotor abnormalities that you wouldn’t expect in typical autism that may\nreflect some brain injury.” Tr. at 249-50. He stated, however, that he did not “have the\nfullest understanding of her as a patient, because that was not [his] focus. It was on the\nbiochemical testing.” Tr. at 250. Indeed, he only saw her as a patient one time. Tr. at\n250.\n\n       Doctor Kelley was also asked about the assertion in his report that A.A. “meets\nbiochemical criteria for the diagnosis of a functional Complex I deficiency”—specifically,\nto which criteria he referring. Tr. at 250. He responded that it was the “strong\ncorrelation between the amino acid profile and . . . [his] association of that with the\nmitochondrial abnormalities.” Tr. at 250-51. When asked what published criteria he\nwas looking at when he made that statement, he conceded that he “go[es] beyond what\nis published.” Tr. at 251. When pressed further, he conceded that his assertion was\nbased only on his own criteria and that he was not aware of any nationally or\ninternationally accepted criteria under which A.A. would be known to have a\n135\n    In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley confirmed that there was a dispute among the authors\nregarding the inclusion of the paragraph discussing recent “increased concern” over “a possible causative\nrole of vaccinations in autistic children with an underlying mitochondrial cytopathy.” Tr. at 259-61 (citing\nWeissman, Pet. Ex. 28, at 4). The paragraph goes on to conclude that “[l]arge, population-based studies\nwill be needed to identify a possible relationship of vaccination with autistic regression in persons with\nmitochondrial cytopathies.” Weissman, Pet. Ex. 28, at 4.\n\n\n                                                    74\n\fmitochondrial disease. Tr. at 251-52. He stated that he does not use criteria such as\nWalker and Bernier, but guessed that “she would not meet those criteria.” 136 Tr. at 252.\n\n        Doctor Kelley was asked to what he was referring when he stated that A.A. had a\n“chronic genetic mitochondrial disorder,” since there was no evidence of a genetic\ndefect. Tr. at 252-53. He responded that the statement was based on his assessment\nof her biochemistry—“there is no explanation for that other than a genetic deficiency\nthat affects mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 252.\n\n       Finally, Dr. Kelley was asked to explain what he meant when he stated at the\nconclusion of his report that in mitochondrial autism, the injury is triggered, but the\ndisease is not. Tr. at 256. He partially answered that the injury was the regression,\nbecause “a regression that leaves the child . . . with permanent neurological deficits is a\nbrain injury.” Tr. at 256.\n\n       During another line of questioning on cross examination, Dr. Kelley was asked to\ndiscuss the significance of timing to his theory that the MMR vaccine caused A.A.’s\nregression, which he characterized as acute. Tr. at 253, 255. He stated that timing was\n“the most important thing.” Tr. at 253. He elaborated that the “sequence of events” in\nthis case were “compatible with the known . . . alterations in the inflammatory response\nthat the vaccine causes,” referring to the increase in cytokines levels. Tr. at 253-54; see\nalso Tr. at 279-81 (redirect). He was then asked what his opinion would be if the\nregression had occurred one month later, instead of one to two weeks. Tr. at 254.\nDoctor Kelley stated that “the small number of cases I know, the onset of regression\nwas . . . between seven and 14 days.” Tr. at 254. However, he claimed that the\n“cytokine response continues for a couple months,” but he could not “remember the\ndetails of the other patients to be able to say whether they continued to get worse.” Tr.\nat 254. When asked whether he would still attribute causation to the vaccine if there\nwas an intervening viral infection or ear infection, he stated that “it’s not the infection,\nper se; it’s the inflammatory response that could be used by either infection or a virus –\nor a vaccine.” Tr. at 254-55.\n\n        Doctor Kelley was questioned also about the factual predicate for his evaluation\nand subsequent opinion: that A.A. had a loss of language, visual contact, and normal\nsocial interaction within one to two weeks following her MMR vaccination. Tr. at 255.\nHe indicated (like Dr. Zimmerman had) that he relied on the history reported to him by\nA.A.’s parents and also contained in Dr. Zimmerman’s records. Tr. at 255-56. When\nfurther pressed, he conceded that there was nothing specific in the medical records to\nindicate that a regression occurred during the alleged time frame. Tr. at 256-57. He\nstated: “I accepted that information as part of my data-gathering, and in trying to figure\n\n\n136\n   On redirect examination, Dr. Kelley stated criteria such as Walker focus on “more severe” and “known”\nmitochondrial diseases. Tr. at 273-74. Consequently, he does not “find any clinical value in [his] patient\npopulation,” so he does not use them.” Tr. at 275. He stated that “most patients, like [A.A.], would not\nmeet those criteria because they’re skewed toward the severe side.” Tr. at 275; see also Tr. at 278-79.\n\n\n                                                   75\n\fout if she had a mitochondrial disease or not, I didn’t delve into the timing. I trust Dr.\nZimmerman.” Tr. at 257.\n\n       Finally, Dr. Kelley was asked on cross examination to further elaborate on why\nhe was able to attribute the MMR vaccine as the cause of the four cases of regression\nhe discussed earlier. Tr. at 257. Unfortunately, he again had difficulty providing a\nresponsive, straightforward answer:\n\n        Just as a comparison or the basis for my feeling that is – fortunately, we\n        don’t have the DPT vaccine anymore, and many years ago, when that –\n        before the – the DTaP, the acellular pertussis vaccine was available, I was\n        aware of cases of regression that occurred immediately on vaccination,\n        like [child’s first name] Poling, who had multiple vaccines and had an\n        acute inflammatory response. The cases I know where the MMR was\n        suspected to be the cause, the timing was – the timing parallels the\n        cytokine – the established – the known cytokine profile. So, that’s like a\n        normal – like a natural infection, and the immune response builds over a\n        period of time. And we understand from the – what effect the\n        inflammatory response has on mitochondria, that it’s the cytokine\n        response – the cytokine profile, the cytokine response of an infection that\n        determines whether or not it will impair mitochondrial function. So, you will\n        not expect a regression to occur with an MMR vaccine in the first few\n        days, unless it w[as] given with another vaccine.\n\nTr. at 257-58. In response to follow-up questions, Dr. Kelley agreed that it was the\ntiming that was most persuasive to him. Tr. at 258; see also Tr. at 285 (redirect). When\nasked if he would ever consider a regression in such circumstance to be coincidental,\nhe responded that he would, but only if there had been another inflammatory event. Tr.\nat 258. He stated, however, that he would not be able to differentiate between\ninflammatory events, so it would still depend on timing. 137 Tr. at 258-59.\n\n        I asked Dr. Kelley to clarify whether he considered regression to be a brain injury.\nTr. at 261. He responded that an acute regression “can be a brain injury or it can be a\nbrain disturbance”—if the child does not recover, then it is a brain injury. Tr. at 261; see\nalso Tr. at 256 (cross). I also asked to clarify whether, in his view, a regression could\noccur without any inciting agent. Tr. at 261-63. In response, he seemed to indicate that\na “stressor” is necessary. Tr. at 261-63. He stated that regressions do not “come out of\nthe blue,” it is just “that we are not always able to identify what the stressor is.” Tr. at\n262.\n\n\n\n137\n   In response to my questioning on this topic, Dr. Kelley elaborated that if there “were another illness\nthat caused an inflammatory response, which probably would increase TNF-alpha, then, yes, if there\nwere another illness superimposed on that time window, then, indeed, one could not separate the two,\nbecause it’s not specific.” Tr. at 268.\n\n\n                                                     76\n\f       In response to my further questioning, Dr. Kelley agreed that it was his view that\n“almost all regressive autism . . . [is] associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at\n269. After further discussion, I questioned whether he was aware of any epidemiologic\nstudy of regression in autism and mitochondrial disorders that has equated all or most\nregression to a mitochondrial problem. Tr. at 271. He responded “no,” and then\nexplained “there are articles that say a child has autism and mitochondrial disease, but\nunfortunately, . . . not all papers separate out one from the other,” and “they are usually\nnot segregated into regressive versus nonregressive.” Tr. at 271; see also Tr. at 281-\n82. He commented that he had planned to do such a study. Tr. at 271-72.\n\n       I then tried to have Dr. Kelley discuss several articles he submitted in support of\nhis theory that inflammation from the MMR vaccine caused or contributed to A.A.’s\nregression. Tr. at 264-68. 138 After an unfruitful attempt to elicit how each article related\nto A.A.’s case, Dr. Kelley stated:\n\n        Yeah, I guess it’s not that I would cite to a particular article for – in [A.A.’s]\n        case. The – I have – one has to look at the larger picture. I have a – a\n        common phenomenon that I see in – as regressive autism – associated\n        with regressive autism in mitochondrial disease, and searching for\n        explanations for that, then I come upon data that talks about cytokine\n        response. So, I can’t – what is most convincing to me in terms of the\n        pathophysiology is TNF-alpha, but it is mostly the fact that the – for\n        [A.A.’s] case in particular, it’s not so much that – it’s the simple\n        observation that a vaccine is designed to cause an inflammatory\n        response, and the timing of that inflammatory response is different in a\n        DPT vaccine. That’s all it is.”\n\nTr. at 267-68.\n\n        At the conclusion of Dr. Kelley’s testimony, I stated that over the years I have\nheard testimony from many different clinicians about various different treatments\npurported to improve autism—from secretin to chelation to methylcobalamin injections.\nTr. at 668. I confessed that some of his testimony seemed in a similar vein. Tr. at 668.\nDoctor Kelley responded that his testimony should be credited based on his 25 years of\nexperience “running a laboratory that’s considered an international standard for this kind\nof work,” his credentials, and the fact that he had given me “hard data, not just clinical\nobservation.” Tr. at 668-69. He expressed significant frustration over the difficulty he\nhas encountered in publishing his methodology. Tr. at 669-72. He stated that he “fully\nappreciate[d my] skepticism because a lot of [his] colleagues feel that . . . you can’t treat\na mitochondrial problem.” Tr. at 671. He concluded: “I’m a clinician and I can see my\npatients getting better on these treatments.” Tr. at 672. This statement conflicted with\n138\n   The articles were: Poland, Pet. Ex. 71; A.

Doctor Wiznitzer.\n\n       In his expert report, Dr. Wiznitzer opined that there was no support in the\ncontemporaneous records for the alleged association, either causal or aggravating,\nbetween A.A.’s MMR vaccination and the occurrence of her ASD. Pet. Ex. K at 13.\nRather, the evidence showed a developmental path consistent with ASD. Id. (citing R.\nLanda, Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life, NAT. CLIN.\nPRACT. NEUROL., 4: 138-47 (2008), filed as Res. Ex. O [hereinafter “Landa, Res. Ex.\nO”]). Of particular significance to his opinion was A.A.’s apparent language delay—an\nearly manifestation of ASD—and the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence\nfor a sudden regression following vaccination. Id.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer thought Dr. Kelley’s causation opinion was inconsistent with the\nevidence. Pet. Ex. K at 14. In his view, A.A.’s mild language delay meant that she\neither did not have the mitochondrial dysfunction Dr. Kelley claimed, or its onset was\nprior to October 23, with a subacute evolution already present on that date. Id. at 14.\nHe did not see an abrupt worsening of A.A.’s language. Id. at 14. Additionally, he\nfound Dr. Kelley’s opinion on the temporal relationship between A.A.’s vaccination and\nthe onset of her ASD to be “purely speculative.” Id. at 14. In his opinion, Dr. Kelley\nfailed to account for the initial history of regression following A.A.’s ear infections.\nDoctor Kelley simply ignored multiple published studies that found no association\nbetween the MMR vaccine and autism, “including regressive autism.” Id. at 14 (citing\nInstitute of Medicine, IMMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW : VACCINES AND AUTISM (2004), filed\nas Res. Ex. P [hereinafter “2004 IOM Report, Res. Ex. P”], at 65-126.; T. Uchiyama, et\nal., MMR-vaccine and regression in autism spectrum disorders: negative results\npresented from Japan, J. AUTISM DEV.

Ex. S\n[hereinafter “Uno, Res. Ex. S”]).\n\n       At hearing, Dr. Wiznitzer testified, consistent with his expert report, that there\nwas no evidence that A.A. regressed within one to two weeks after receiving the MMR\nvaccine or that the vaccine played any role in her developmental disabilities. Tr. at 485.\nRather, her developmental trajectory changed by her 15-month checkup—something\nthat the MMR vaccination neither caused nor aggravated. Tr. at 485-87, 515-17.\n\n\n\n\n                                            78\n\f       Doctor Wiznitzer began by explaining that the typical 15-month-old possesses\none to three words for speech, 139 which are “above and beyond any kind of imitations\nand sounds that [the parent] might do.” Tr. at 486. Additionally, such children have\nbegun to walk, are “finger feeding,” can wave goodbye, are interested in peekaboo and\npat-a-cake games, can play with cause-and-effect toys, and have started to stack\nblocks. Tr. at 485. They also will reliably turn when called by name and can sometimes\nfollow simple one-step commands. Tr. at 486.\n\n        Based on his review of the available records, Dr. Wiznitzer testified that A.A. had\nnormal development during her first year and attained some of these milestones. Tr. at\n485. However, by the time of her 15-month checkup, her developmental trajectory had\nchanged and an apparent speech delay was present. Tr. at 486; see also Tr. at 610-11\n(court examination). Indeed, it was his opinion that A.A.’s speech development was\nlikely delayed even at her one-year checkup. He noted that although she reportedly\nhad one to three words at that time, multiple later records indicated that she only “made\nanimal sounds and maybe had one word” at that point. Tr. at 486; compare, e.g., Pet.\nEx. 9, p. 10 (“says 1-3 words”) with Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5 (“said her first word ‘Quack’ at 1 year\nand speaking a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months”). He also saw evidence\nof language delay in the October 14 video recorded prior to her vaccination. In video\nsegments taken at home, he observed that A.A. vocalized but used no words, including\n“ma-ma and da-da”—even though her parents were present. Tr. at 487 . He questioned\nwhether A.A. was using these words with specificity, meaning that when she said “ma-\nma,” she did so in reference to her mother. She said no words during her visit to the\npumpkin patch later that same day. Tr. at 480-90.\n\n      Additionally, Dr. Wiznitzer saw some “subtle” differences in her behavior from\nwhat would normally be expected from a developmental standpoint. Tr. at 487. For\nexample, in the video she never raised her hands to be picked up from her crib, and\nwhen she stopped to look at a favorite stuffed animal, she flapped her hands—a motor\nmannerism or “stereotypy” commonly seen in autistic individuals and noted in later\nrecords by Dr. Zimmerman. 140 Tr. at 487-88; see Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n\n\n139\n   In his expert report, he stated that at 15 months, “a child typically has 3-5 words and mature jargon\nwith real words.” Res. Ex. K at 13.\n140\n    On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman stated that he did not agree with Dr. Wiznitzer that A.A. exhibited hand-\nflapping in the video. Tr. at 676. He viewed the behavior as “normal movements with excitement for a\nchild that age.” Id. He stated that there were “some repetitive movements – arm movements such as\nwhen she was holding a couple of glass coasters and banging them together, but she did not have hand\nflapping.” Id. He explained that “there is a fairly typical progression” in ASD—a “hierarchy of symptoms.”\nId. At onset there is “the loss of language and social skills,” which is followed by “the repetitive\nmovements, the circling behaviors and the hand flapping and jumping.” Id. He stated that the behaviors\nin the video were “not like that and [he] would not have expected them” at that point. Id. It is unclear why\nhe thought that the repetitive movements he identified in the video (i.e., banging coasters) were normal as\nopposed to repetitive movements falling within the hierarchy of symptoms. Dr. Zimmerman later testified\nthat stereotypies, including repetitive behaviors, hand flapping, and circling movements, can present\nbefore the loss of language, “but this would be very unusual.” Tr. at 681 (recross).\n\n\n                                                    79\n\f        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer acknowledged that A.A. was interactive with\nher parents in the October 14 video, but he found the quality and level of her interaction\nto be mildly diminished. Tr. at 529. For instance, although she was seen handing her\nmother a toy, running back and forth around the house, and making eye contact (at\nleast with the camera), she did not hug her parents or raise her hands to be picked up.\nTr. at 529. He stated that the real question was whether this was the type of interaction\n“normally expected . . . or was it mildly diminished as we see in some of the studies\n[where] children gradually evolve into the autistic clinical picture.” Tr. at 529-30.\n\n         In his view, A.A.’s lack of spoken functional words, 141 her disinterest in being\nlifted from her crib, and her distinctive motor mannerisms, were indicative of existing\ndevelopmental problems and early signs of autism. Tr. at 488-89; see also Tr. at 500-\n01 (direct); 603-04 (court examination). As a consequence, Dr. Wiznitzer disagreed\nwith Dr. Zimmerman that A.A. was developmentally normal on October 14, a few days\nbefore her vaccination. Tr. at 486-87.\n\n        With regard to A.A.’s post-vaccination condition, Dr. Wiznitzer stated that nothing\nin the contemporaneous medical evidence reflected an adverse vaccine reaction or an\nabrupt deterioration of her development. 142 Tr. at 491. Indeed, A.A. did not have a\nreturn medical visit for nearly two months, until December 18, when she was treated for\na respiratory infection and ear infection. Tr. at 496. Nothing in the record from that visit\nreferenced any loss of skills or other significant change. Tr. at 496-97 (citing Pet. Ex. 9,\np. 59). Doctor Wiznitzer viewed this as a clear indication that the vaccine had no\nadverse impact on A.A.’s health or development. He stated that in his experience,\nwhen parents see something different in their child, they come in for an office visit and\nbring up the problem. He was confident “that if there was a concern . . . going on at that\ntime, it would have been identified.” Tr. at 496-97.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer noted that another opportunity to identify an adverse reaction\nwas on April 2, 2001, when A.A. visited her doctor and received additional vaccinations.\nTr. at 515; see Pet. Ex. 9, p. 1. He explained that physicians typically ask parents about\nproblems with prior vaccinations before they administer others, and will document the\nparents’ response. Tr. at 515-16. Nothing was noted in A.A.’s record about an adverse\nreaction following her October 23 vaccination. Neither was anything noted when she\nvisited her doctor a month earlier, in March 2001. Tr. at 516; see Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 8, 18,\n56. Doctor Wiznitzer also found no documentation of any phone calls from A.A.’s\nparents reporting a fever or similar concern, which was curious since they did not\nhesitate to contact the physician and bring her in for an appointment at other times\nwhen she had fever or was ill. Tr. at 516.\n141\n    Doctor Wiznitzer distinguished functional words from “just repeating animal sounds” or “holding up a\nfinger” to show one’s age. To illustrate his point, he noted a clip from the video that showed A.A.\nresponding to the question of her age with the incorrect script—she answered with the “how big” gesture,\nrather than the raised finger. Tr. at 488-89; see also Tr. at 603-04 (cross).\n142\n   He noted that even records created months after the vaccination contained no notations regarding\nregression. Tr. at 491.\n\n\n                                                   80\n\f       Doctor Wiznitzer likewise found no indication in the contemporaneous records\nthat A.A. had a speech regression within two weeks of her vaccination. Tr. at 493. He\nexplained that speech regression 143 in autism is the loss of between three and five\nfunctional words—words “that the child is using for functional purposes [and] have\npersisted for at least one month.” Tr. at 492. He emphasized that such words are in\naddition to “the specific ma-ma and da-da.” 144 Tr. at 492. Based on the evidence, he\nwas doubtful that A.A. had three to five functional words to lose. 145 Tr. at 523, 552.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer challenged Ms. Edick’s assertion that “a 15-\nmonth old has a vocabulary of 10 to 24 words” as an incorrect statement—“[a] special\neducation teacher shouldn’t say that.”146 Tr. at 535. Doctor Wiznitzer explained that it\nwould be “highly, highly unlikely” for a child that age to have such a vocabulary due to\nthe way language develops and also “the immaturity of the oral motor mechanism in\nterms of verbalization.” Tr. at 535-36. He stated that in his many years of practice he\ncould not recall ever meeting a child who had 24 words at 15 months of age—\n“functional words that they use independently.” Tr. at 536.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer also reviewed and discussed the October 29 video taken at the\nHalloween event, which allegedly showed significant post-vaccination behavioral\nchanges. Contrary to petitioners’ view, he saw no evidence in the video of the alleged\nregression, or any other significant behavioral issues. Tr. at 493, 495. For an\nequivalent comparison, he focused on A.A.’s behavior at the pumpkin patch on October\n14 because both were “shot basically in the same environment.” Tr. at 493. Her\nbehavior on the two occasions was strikingly similar. Tr. at 495. At the pumpkin patch,\nfor instance, she barely vocalized and seemed uncomfortable with her surroundings,\nalthough she did engage in some limited exploration. Tr. at 490, 531. Likewise, at the\nHalloween event, she was quiet and appeared unsettled with the “hubbub” and\ncommotion of the crowd. Tr. at 494. Doctor Wiznitzer also noted that she responded to\n143\n   Doctor Wiznitzer explained that speech regression is different from speech delay. The latter “is failure\nto have adequate language development[.] . . . It’s not that you’ve lost words; it’s that [language] does not\ndevelop the way it should.” Tr. at 492. To illustrate his point, he described “children with speech delay\nwho may have some word utterances for a few days and then lose those words.” Tr. at 493. Such an\nevent is not speech regression; instead it is an instance of someone having taught the child to repeat\ncertain words, but because they held no functional purpose, they faded. Tr. at 493.\n144\n  Doctor Wiznitzer explained that “ma-ma” and “da-da” are excluded because parents can “confuse[] the\nnonspecific babble with the specific terms.” Tr. at 492.\n145\n  On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman stated that he disagreed that A.A. had no functional words to lose—she\nhad “moo.” Tr. at 677.\n146\n   As a school-based special education teacher, Ms. Edick would not have much contact with children\nunder the age of three in a teacher-student setting. Early intervention programs provide treatment for\nchildren with developmental delays and neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD up to three years of\nage. At that point, the children transition to services provided through the school system. A.A. similarly\ntransitioned to school-based programs at three years of age. Tr. at 87, 89, 548; Pet. Ex. 7, p. 10.\n(preschool at Village Green Day School in the fall of 2001).\n\n\n                                                     81\n\fher name on both occasions, although inconsistently. 147 Tr. at 532; see also Tr. at 611-\n12.\n\n       However, Dr. Wiznitzer saw “a clear difference” in her behavior and social\ninteractions when she was in the familiar surroundings of home as compared to outside\nin public. Tr. at 490; see also Tr. at 604-05 (court examination). For instance, as seen\nin the October 14 video clips taken at home, A.A. comfortably babbled, laughed, and\ninteracted with her parents; whereas later that same day, at the pumpkin patch, she\nvocalized very little and was much less active. Tr. at 490, 533. He explained that such\nreticent behavior was not unusual or necessarily concerning from a developmental\nstandpoint, as children at this age often feel “stranger anxiety” and vary in the time\nneeded to acclimate to a given situation. Tr. at 490. Available medical records\n“described her as shy, suggesting that she required a bit more time to acclimate in\ncomparison to the average child.” Tr. at 490-91. According to Dr. Wiznitzer, what was\nimportant from a developmental perspective was A.A.’s evident awareness of her\nsurroundings and the people around her—she was just “a bit overwhelmed by what\n[was] going on.” Tr. at 494, 533.\n\n        In response to my questions, Dr. Wiznitzer discussed the video clips taken\nbetween Christmas Day and December 30. Tr. at 605-08. He stated that by\nChristmastime “there was clearly a change.” Tr. at 606. He observed that she was not\nmaking good eye contact; she was not vocalizing; and she had decreased interaction.\nTr. at 605. She was also “still doing some cause/effect play,” but it was less than the\nplay seen in the October 14 video. Tr. at 605. He even observed a difference between\nthe October 29 video and the Christmas Day video, noting that on the earlier occasion\nshe “did the appropriate thing” with the beanbag game—put the beanbag through the\nhole—whereas on Christmas she had no real interest in the toys and was seen flicking\na string instead. Tr. at 606. Doctor Wiznitzer, however, was unable to state, based on\nthe videos alone, that there was a continuum of deterioration between October and\nDecember. Tr. at 608. This was because the videos were shot in different\nenvironments. Tr. at 608.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was questioned further about the timeline of\nA.A.’s autistic presentation. Tr. at 541-49. He agreed that “around Christmastime” it\nbecame clear that there was “something not right” about A.A.’s behavior. Tr. 541-42.\nHe also agreed with the basic timeline of events thereafter leading up to her formal\ndiagnosis; however, he disputed that it took 15 months for her to receive a diagnosis.\nTr. at 549. Rather, he calculated that nine months elapsed between her Christmastime\nbehavior and Dr. Lavenstein’s note that she had “autistic symptomology.” Tr. at 549\n(citing Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96).\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer was also questioned about Ms. Edick’s testimony concerning\nA.A.’s behavior on Veterans’ Day weekend. Tr. at 537-41. He found it difficult to place\n\n147\n  Doctor Wiznitzer explained that A.A.’s inconsistency in responding to her name was typical “kiddie\nbehavior.” Tr. at 611. However, if that behavior was consistent, it would be a “red flag.” Id.\n\n\n                                                   82\n\fsignificant weight on her recollections, as the events she described occurred many\nyears earlier and were uncorroborated by any independent documentation. Tr. at 537-\n38, 540. He indicated that he did not doubt Ms. Edick’s observations, but whether they\noccurred at the times she remembered them occurring. Tr. at 538-41. He explained\nthat in his clinical experience, when patients relate a history they will often be more\naccurate when the event is close in time. Tr. at 538-39. As time passes, “there can be\nsome distortion of the information either in terms of telescoping, putting it into a different\ntime zone, or not necessarily appreciating some of the important facts or points that\nwere there.” Tr. at 539; see also Tr. at 614-16 (court examination).\n\n        In his view, A.A.’s abnormalities in speech and behavior were present prior to her\nvaccination and were early signs of autism. Tr. at 500-01. Doctor Wiznitzer explained\nthat autism spectrum disorder is a “neurodevelopmental condition that impacts\nadversely on socialization and social communication and has associated restrictiveness\nand repetitive behaviors with onset in the early childhood years.” Tr. at 497. He stated\nthat “presentation is usually between age one and two years,” but symptoms are always\npresent before age three years. Tr. at 497. Although presentation varies, speech delay\nis the “most common” complaint from parents. Tr. at 497-98. Other symptoms include\ndecreased eye contact and changes in social behavior. Tr. at 498.\n\n         Doctor Wiznitzer then described three common ASD presentation types. In one\ngroup, the symptoms are not obvious at the time, but are apparent in retrospect. Tr. at\n498. In such cases, parents often begin to see differences between the functioning of\ntheir child and that of their child’s normal peers, especially in the area of language\ndevelopment. Tr. at 498. When these parents look back, they realize that their child\nhas been symptomatic from early- to mid-infancy. Tr. at 498. In a second group, the\nchildren seem to be functioning “at or near normal for about the first year to two years of\nlife, [but] then [undergo] a stagnation of their development”—they “don’t seem to move\nto the next developmental level.” Tr. at 498. Such children might, for example, fail to\ntransition from the “sociability stage, which is like smiling . . . at people, having some\ninterest in looking at them, to more active interactions and interventions, in going up to\nthem.” Tr. at 498. The third group consists of children who “appear to have normal\ndevelopmental progression and then actually have a true regression of skills.” Tr. at\n499. In those children, the regression “could first start as a speech regression, but\nquickly gets linked with a speech and social skills regression.” Tr. at 499.\n\n       In response to my questions, Dr. Wiznitzer elaborated that regression in autism is\nnot an abrupt occurrence. Tr. at 597-602. He explained that the loss of language and\nsocial skills typically “evolve[s] over a period of weeks to a period of months.”148 Tr. at\n600-01. He stated that “an overnight story” would lead him to “start looking for other\ndisorders.” Tr. at 601.\n\n\n148\n   Doctor Wiznitzer defined a “gradual onset” as taking months, and an “abrupt onset” as taking weeks.\nTr. at 601. He stated that the loss of skills is usually gradual—over a period of “a month or two.” Tr. at\n602.\n\n\n                                                    83\n\f        Doctor Wiznitzer agreed with A.A.’s ASD diagnosis, which he found supported by\nthe records. Tr. at 499. He elaborated that the “records in 2001 and afterwards clearly\ntell us that she has . . . features consistent with that diagnosis. She has . . . impairment\nin socialization, and impairment in pragmatic skills, [and] impairment in social\ncommunication.” Tr. at 499. Repeatedly, she met the diagnostic criteria for ASD in\nestablished rating scales. Tr. at 499.\n\n        According to Dr. Wiznitzer, A.A.’s autistic presentation was not atypical; it fell\nwithin the expected range. Tr. at 500. Moreover, even “a relatively rapid regression”—\nwhich was not shown—would still be “within the framework of what’s been described for\nthe population.” Tr. at 500.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer discussed potential causes of autism, including whether\nvaccines are known to play a role. He explained that the disorder is biologically based,\nwith “a strong genetic component.” Tr. at 501. The “vast majority have or will be shown\nto have underlying genetic problems with genes that influence brain development.” 149\nTr. at 501. Others can be affected by “insults to the brain prenatally, perhaps due to\nsome toxic agent,” such as valproate or excessive alcohol exposure. Tr. at 501.\nPrematurity has also been described, although it is yet unclear whether it is the\nprematurity itself or some gene abnormality that is responsible for the autistic\nphenotype 150 in such children. Tr. at 501. He acknowledged the association between\nprimary mitochondrial disease and ASD, which has been reported in the literature, but\nstated that there is no known connection between vaccination and autism. Tr. at 502-\n03. Ultimately, the underlying cause of ASD is not always known. Tr. at 501.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer then addressed Dr. Kelley’s theory that the MMR vaccine\ncauses a TNF-α-mediated inflammatory response, which can lead to autistic regression\nin individuals with mitochondrial abnormalities. Tr. at 503. Of importance to Dr.\nWiznitzer were two articles cited by Dr. Kelley as support for this theory. The first study\nexamined the immune response related to immunosuppression in subjects vaccinated\nwith live attenuated rubella vaccine. A. Pukhalsky, et al., Cytokine profile after rubella\nvaccine inoculation; evidence of the immunosuppressive effect of vaccination, MEDIAT.\nINFLAMM., 12 (4): 203-07 (2003), filed as Pet. Ex. 54 [hereinafter “Pukhalsky, Pet. Ex.\n54”]. The second study focused on the cytokine production profile of children following\nthe first and second doses of the measles vaccine. Poland, Pet. Ex. 71. In his view,\nneither article supported Dr. Kelley’s hypothesis regarding the inflammatory effect of\nvaccines. Tr. at 506, 510.\n\n      With regard to the Pukhalsky article, Dr. Wiznitzer first commented on its title,\nwhich he noted “does not say immune-inflammatory effect but immunosuppressive\n\n\n\n149\n      He recalled Dr. Zimmerman’s testimony regarding synaptic development as an example. Tr. at 501.\n150\n      Doctor Wiznitzer defined “phenotype” as “the clinical picture.” Tr. at 502.\n\n\n                                                        84\n\feffect.” Tr. at 504. He explained that cytokines 151 have a “variety of jobs” and not all\nare pro-inflammatory. 152 Tr. at 504, 593. In this study, the researchers analyzed the\nlevels of certain cytokines following vaccination, including interleukin (IL)-4, tumor\nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-10. Their results showed that IL-4\nlevels remained essentially the same seven days after vaccine inoculation—they were\n“no different than . . . at baseline.” Tr. at 504-05 (citing Fig. 2). Their results also\nshowed the interplay between IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) and TNF-α (a pro-\ninflammatory cytokine). Tr. at 505 (citing Fig. 3). The researchers found that, at seven\ndays post-vaccination, there was “no significant rise in the TNF-[α] value, which means\nthere should be no increased risk of inflammation compared to baseline.” Tr. at 505.\nThere was, however, a significant rise in IL-10, which suggested that “at that time [there]\nmay [have been] a bit more anti-inflammation compared to inflammation.” Tr. at 505.\nAnd then “at 30 days out, basically there’s much more anti-inflammation compared to\ninflammation, which is why the article [was titled] the immunosuppressive effect.” Tr. at\n505-06. He concluded that the article did “not support Dr. Kelley’s hypothesis that\nwithin one to two weeks there is a significant rise in TNF-alpha.” Tr. at 506. “[I]n fact,\nyou can make an argument that this article tells us that the rise in IL-10 would actually\ntame the inflammatory process.” Tr. at 506.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer then discussed the Poland article, which also examined\ncytokine levels following vaccination. Tr. at 506-10; see also Tr. at 588-95 (cross). The\nstudy analyzed cytokine secretion and plasma levels of six cytokines in two groups of\nchildren following measles vaccination. The first group consisted of 12-15 month-old\ntoddlers receiving their first measles vaccination, and the second group was composed\nof children aged 4-12 years receiving a second dose. Measurements were taken prior\nto vaccination to obtain a baseline and then at regular intervals thereafter, to 40 days.\nTr. at 507. Doctor Wiznitzer focused on the results of the first group because the\nchildren were analogous to A.A. in age and circumstance (i.e., first dose of a vaccine).\nTr. at 508. He began with figure 1(A), 153 which showed that for the first 15 days\nfollowing vaccination—the critical time period according to Dr. Kelley—none of the\n\n151\n   Cytokine is “a generic term for non-antibody proteins released by one cell population (e.g., primed T\nlymphocytes) on contact with specific antigen, which act as intercellular mediators, as in the generation of\nan immune response.” DORLAND’S at 466.\n152\n   According to Dr. Wiznitzer, “Dr. Kelley represented IL-4 as a pro-inflammatory substance.” Tr. at 594.\nPetitioners’ counsel disagreed with his recollection. Id. In his testimony, Dr. Kelley grouped IL-4 with\n“dozens” of other “factors that will be sent out” in response to infection, including IL-6 and TNF-α. Tr. at\n219. During this portion of testimony, Dr. Kelley went on to discuss how various studies have “shown\nwhat the cytokine response is in this infection or that immunization,” but stated “correlations have not\nbeen made as to . . . what combination of cytokines are most likely to impair mitochondrial function.” Tr.\nat 219. Although he did not specifically identify IL-4 as “pro-inflammatory,” his comments implied that he\nviewed IL-4 as such, and are thus illustrative of the challenges posed by his imprecise and rambling\ntestimony.\n153\n    Doctor Wiznitzer explained that the results shown in figure 1(A) were obtained from white blood cells\nthat were secreting cytokines. Tr. at 594-95. The researchers then “took the supernatant, which is the\nfluid around the cells, and analyzed it for concentration of the cytokines.” Tr. at 595.\n\n\n                                                     85\n\fvalues for IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-α secretion rose above their baseline. 154 Tr. at 508. “In\nfact, at two weeks afterwards, IL-6 and . . . TNF-alpha [fell] below their baseline values\n[, and] IL-4 basically [did not] change to any significance.” Tr. at 508; see also Tr. at\n590-94 (cross). Similarly, the values in figure 2(A), which reflected plasma cytokine\nlevels at regular intervals, remained fairly steady. Tr. at 509. Specifically, there was no\nappreciable change in the blood levels of IL-6 and TNF-α over time, and IL-4 fluctuated\nup and down. Tr. at 509-10. He noted that “the paper itself state[d] that there was no\nappreciable change in the cytokine levels” for the toddler group. Tr. at 510.\n\n       In summary, Dr. Wiznitzer stated that “the two articles that Dr. Kelley brought to\nthe Court and cited do not support his proposition that IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-alpha levels in\nthe blood or in cell culture rise within two weeks of a vaccination, which means that that\ncan’t be the mechanism of this purported injury.” Tr. at 510.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer also expressed significant concerns with the “very unclear”\nmethodology Dr. Kelley used to interpret A.A.’s amino acid test results. Tr. at 510. He\ndirected attention to Pet. Ex. 23A, the spreadsheet summary of A.A.’s amino acid\nprofile, which Dr. Kelley used to show that A.A. met the biochemical criteria for a\nfunctional complex I deficiency diagnosis. Tr. at 511. His first concern related to the\ncalculation of the range and mean values. Doctor Wiznitzer stated that it appeared,\nbased on his own calculations, that Dr. Kelley had taken the minimum range value plus\nthe maximum range value and divided by two, “which means [that] his lab . . . has a\nperfect bell-shaped curve of data.” Tr. at 511. He stated that this “only happens in\narticles and problems that are given to students . . . . In the real world, there’s always\neither a shift to the right or a little . . . shift to the left. You’re not exactly in the middle\nevery single time.” Tr. at 511. He further noted that Dr. Kelley’s sample size was 100,\nwhich is too small to obtain a perfect bell curve. Tr. at 513.\n\n        His second concern related to the “normalized ratios to mean normal,” which was\nnoted on the spreadsheet as “0.8 to 1.2.” Tr. at 513. Doctor Wiznitzer stated that Dr.\nKelley again “doesn’t tell us how that normal was calculated. He basically says trust\nme; that’s because I found it to be this way.” Tr. at 513. Doctor Wiznitzer then\nperformed an example calculation using the values shown for the amino acid taurine.\nTr. at 513. He explained that the resulting value would be considered “an outlier in this\npopulation, but yet it’s still within the normal range”—an unusual outcome. Tr. at 513.\nHe also took issue with Dr. Kelley’s apparent comfort with standard deviations as great\nas 11. 155 Tr. at 513-14. The standard deviation for a normal range is usually “plus or\nminus two standard deviations.” Tr. at 514.\n154\n   On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was asked whether the cytokine fluctuations that occurred\nbetween day zero and day 15, as shown in figure 1(A), were indicative of inflammation. Tr. at 591-94.\nHe explained that although the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α fluctuated, they returned to baseline—and\n“baseline is not inflammation.” Tr. at 594.\n155\n  Doctor Wiznitzer recalled Dr. Kelley’s statement that “one of his lab values was 11 standard deviations\nabove the mean.” Tr. at 513-14 (see Tr. at 181). He found “it extremely hard to believe that any of these\nnumbers are 11 standard deviations above the mean. That is an astronomically high number.” Tr. at\n514.\n\n\n                                                   86\n\f       Doctor Wiznitzer’s final concern related to the application of Dr. Kelley’s normal\nrange values to the test results from other labs. Tr. at 514. He cautioned that Dr.\nKelley’s assumption that the other labs’ numbers were derived from historical data could\nbe mistaken. Tr. at 514. In addition to fluctuations in testing between labs, the other\nlabs could also have established their own normal ranges. Tr. at 514. So applying the\nvalues as he has done “can be fraught with problems.” Tr. at 514.\n\n        As a consequence of these concerns, Dr. Wiznitzer found it difficult to “state that\nthis information has any value.” Tr. at 515. Without knowing “where these numbers\ncame from,” the validity of the values and resulting conclusions are completely suspect.\nTr. at 515. “There’s a lot of unanswered questions here . . . [a]nd those are only some\nof them.” Tr. at 515.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer confirmed that he does not evaluate or\ndiagnose mitochondrial disorders, but instead refers patients to colleagues who are\nmitochondrial specialists. Tr. at 549-50. He discussed the factors or clinical\npresentations which would lead him to provide a referral for a mitochondrial evaluation.\nTr. at 550-51. He stated that he would likely refer for “unexplained lactic acidosis;\nunexplained multi-organ system disease; neuro-imaging abnormalities that could be\nconsistent with a mitochondrial disorder, such as abnormal signal from the basil ganglia\nand white matter; abnormalities in amino acid metabolism, especially significantly\nelevated alanine; [and] intractable epilepsy that’s not explainable.” Tr. at 550. He\nwould also refer for unexplained developmental delay and global regression, which he\ndefined as regression in all skills. 156 Tr. at 552.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer typically would not refer an autistic child for a mitochondrial\nevaluation. Tr. at 554. He explained that he would look to standardized guidelines on\nthe evaluation of children with autism. Tr. at 555-56. At a minimum he would order a\nchromosome micro array, a DNA test for fragile X syndrome, and a test for Rett\nsyndrome (if the child was female). Tr. at 556. Then he would “look at the rest of the\nclinical scenario. So, if I have a child who clearly has a history of regression, I then start\nlooking for potential underlying metabolic problems. And then I’ll do the metabolic\ntesting. But I don’t do it for every child. That is not what’s recommended in the\nguidelines.” Tr. at 556. Dr. Wiznitzer stated that has “had children who present with\nautistic regression, clear-cut history of autistic regression, well-documented history of\nautistic regression. And I have done the full workup, which includes the metabolic\nworkup.” Tr. at 557. “I do that on a regular basis.” Tr. at 557.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was questioned about his heavy reliance on\ncontemporaneous medical records and asked whether he had “totally discounted” the\nstatements made by A.A.’s parents and aunt. Tr. at 521. Doctor Wiznitzer responded\nthat he “never discount[ed] anything,” but tried to place it in context. Tr. at 521. In his\n\n156\n   Doctor Wiznitzer disagreed that A.A. had a global regression. Tr. at 552. Rather, it was his opinion\nthat she had a social regression consistent with autism. Tr. at 552.\n\n\n                                                   87\n\fview, statements made about unmemorable events many years earlier must be afforded\nless weight than contemporaneous accounts documented in the record. Tr. at 520. For\nexample, with regard to A.A.’s alleged post-vaccination fever, he found it difficult to\nbelieve that her parents would not have reported it to her primary care provider when it\noccurred—especially when they did not previously hesitate to contact her physician for\nsuch matters. Tr. at 520. He expressed similar reservations “about the whole scenario,\nfever, speech regression, social regression, motor regression. These are serious\nproblems, and I don’t see [them] reflected in the medical records at all.” Tr. at 521. I\nnote that I was unable to note any contemporaneous medical record or history provided\nclose in time to the period of alleged regression that reflected a loss of motor skills,\nnotwithstanding Mr. Allen’s testimony about A.A. crawling more than walking at one\npoint after the vaccination. It was clear from his testimony that she had not lost the\nability to walk at any point.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer was also cross-examined about A.A.’s post-vaccination\nregression. He reiterated that he had fully considered the statements and testimony of\nA.A.’s parents and aunt, but found them largely unsupported by the record. Tr. at 521-\n23. With regard to A.A.’s alleged regression of speech, he emphasized that based on\nthe available records, “there was no speech to be lost.” Tr. at 523. He noted that Dr.\nLavenstein’s initial report, for example, indicated that A.A. may have had some oral\nsounds but then subsequently regressed. Tr. at 523 (citing Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96 (primitive\nspeech)). “That’s not a speech regression; that’s oral sounds. And even Dr. Lavenstein\ndocumented that she had no words. You can’t have a speech regression if you have no\nwords.” Tr. at 523. Doctor Wiznitzer acknowledged that Dr. Lavenstein used the term\n“regression” for the loss of oral sounds, but emphasized that the “true definition of\nspeech is not primitive sounds, it’s not babbling.” Tr. at 524, 553.\n\n       In response to additional questioning, Dr. Wiznitzer reviewed the medical record\nof A.A.’s one-year checkup, which indicated she said “1-3 words.” Tr. at 524 (citing Pet.\nEx. 9, p. 10). He acknowledged what the record reflected, but explained that a checked\nbox is not that informative. For instance, “we don’t know what those words were, we\ndon’t know how long they persisted, [and] we don’t know if they lasted for more than a\nmonth, which is the criteria you need to use.” Tr. at 525. Unfortunately, “[a]ll it says\nhere is that she had words. There’s no documentation of anything else.” Tr. at 525.\nDoctor Wiznitzer saw this as an example of a “superficial” history, which failed to get to\n“the core information” because the clinician did not “dig deeper” and ask more than\nroutine questions. Tr. at 525-26. He confessed that it can be difficult in the clinical\nsetting to get good, detailed histories about language; however, they are vitally\nimportant, which is why the Autism Diagnostic Interview, 157 for example, asks such in-\ndepth questions. Tr. at 528.\n\n\n157\n   The Autism Diagnostic Interview is a testing instrument used in “diagnosing autism, planning\ntreatment, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders.” See WPS (publisher),\nhttp://www.wpspublish.com/store/p/2645/autism-diagnostic-interview-revised-adi-r (last visited Sept. 10,\n2015).\n\n\n                                                   88\n\f        He found similar problems with the speech pathologist’s report, which stated that\nA.A. “said her first word, quack, at one year and speaking a little more using animal\nsounds at 15 months.” Tr. at 527 (quoting Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5). He explained that the\nphrase “speaking a little more” is ambiguous and therefore unhelpful because it gives\nno indication of the number and quality of words present at 15 months, which is an\nimportant piece of information for diagnostic purposes. Tr. at 528. Depending on the\ndefinition, a speech regression is the loss of “either three words or five words, besides\nma-ma and da-da”—and “[t]here’s no comment here about whether she ever used ma-\nma and da-da.”158 Tr. at 528.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer contrasted these poorly obtained histories with the one elicited\nby Dr. Lavenstein, which he viewed as a good, well-documented example. Tr. at 526.\nDoctor Lavenstein’s report provided a clear indication of the quality of A.A.’s “speech”—\nshe “had oral sounds. He clearly had asked . . . the question, did your child have\nfunctional words, and the answer was no.” 159 Tr. at 526.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was asked whether children with metabolic\nproblems are known to decompensate with infections. Tr. at 557. He indicated that\ndecompensation can occur with certain kinds of metabolic disorders, but in general, it is\nnot a concern. Tr. at 557. “It depends on the specific metabolic problem they have.”\nTr. at 557. He noted, for example, that patients with urea cycle disorders are\nsusceptible to potentially deleterious effects, but children “with creatine transport\ndeficiency don’t fall apart . . . with infection . . . [y]et they have a metabolic disturbance.”\nTr. at 558-59.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer was then questioned about an article submitted by Doctor\nCederbaum regarding the administration of vaccines to children with inborn errors of\nmetabolism [“IEM”]. Tr. at 559-64, 587-88 (citing F. Menni, et al., Vaccination in\nchildren with inborn errors of metabolism, VACCINE, 30 (50): 7161-64 (2012), filed as\nRes. Ex. E [hereinafter “Menni, Res. Ex. E”]). The article stated that administering\nvaccines to children with IEMs “is not as simple as in healthy subjects because the\nvaccines themselves can cause problems. They can theoretically deteriorate the fragile\nmetabolic equilibrium of affected children, particularly when they cause the same\nmetabolic (albeit less severe) changes that are usually associated with the disease they\nare meant to prevent.” Menni, Res. Ex. E at 7161-62. The article continued: “Vaccines\nshould be administered more cautiously to children with IEMs associated with significant\nrisk of morbidity and/or mortality with catabolic events: i.e., under strict medical\nsupervision, and only when the children are clinically well and their metabolic condition\nis acceptably controlled.” Id. at 7163. It also noted that “[p]articular care should be\n158\n   Doctor Wiznitzer stated that he did not recall A.A. using “ma-ma” or “da-da” to refer to her parents in\nthe video segments he watched. Tr. at 528.\n159\n   Doctor Wiznitzer indicated that if A.A.’s parents had told him that their child stopped talking, he would\nhave inquired about the level of “talking” she had been doing—was she simply repeating what the parents\nsaid, was she making animal sounds, did she have functional words? He emphasized that “we need all\nthat kind of information.” Tr. at 526.\n\n\n                                                     89\n\ftaken when administering vaccines based on live attenuated viruses because they can\ncause the same metabolic derangements as wild virus infections.” Id.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer agreed with the authors’ statements, but noted the word\n“theoretically”—“that doesn’t say it will do it, it just says theoretically.” Tr. at 560-61. He\nexplained that the concern relates to the fact that “vaccines can cause fever and fever\ncan make you catabolic.” Tr. at 561. He stated that the authors were not referring to all\nmetabolic disorders, but only those “that are at risk for morbidity when they go catabolic,\nsuch as amino acid disorders, organic acidemias, and urea cycle disorders.” Tr. at 561.\nMoreover, it was not the immunization, but its timing that was important—it should be\ngiven when the child is well and her condition is controlled. Tr. at 562. In response to\nadditional questioning, Dr. Wiznitzer confirmed that the MMR vaccine contains live\nattenuated virus, which is a weakened, “tamed down” version of the natural virus\nintended “provoke the immune response without provoking . . . a clinical infection.” Tr.\nat 563-64.\n\n         Doctor Wiznitzer was also questioned about a study that was discussed in the\nMenni (Res. Ex. E) article. Tr. at 565-87 (citing N. Klein, et al., Evaluation of\nImmunization Rates and Safety Among Children with Inborn Errors of Metabolism,\nPEDIATRICS, 127: e1139-46 (2011), filed as Res. Ex. D [hereinafter “Klein, Res. Ex. D”]).\nThe study focused on children with inherited metabolic disorders and sought to better\nunderstand immunization rates and vaccine safety within this population. Klein, Res.\nEx. D at e1139. Data for the study was obtained from medical records contained in the\nNorthern California Kaiser Permanente electronic database from 1990 to 2007. Id.\nBased on their analyses, the researchers found that vaccination of children with IEMs\n“was not associated with any significant increase in emergency department visits or\nhospitalizations during the 30 days after vaccination.” Id. However, “[s]econdary\nanalyses suggested that there may be increased rates of hospitalizations 2 weeks after\nvaccination for the sickest 1- to 4-year-old children.” Id. The researchers concluded\nthat “[i]mmunization was not associated with increased risk for serious adverse events\nduring the month after vaccination,” a finding that “provid[ed] overall reassurance that\nroutine vaccination of children with [IEMs] does not result in adverse effects.” Id.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer specifically addressed the researchers’ secondary analyses,\nwhich indicated a possible increase in the rate of hospitalization for children in the\n“sickest” category. Tr. at 565. He first explained that the researchers’ use of the word\n“may” indicated that the results did not reach statistical significance. 160 Tr. at 565-66.\nHe then explained that the results of the secondary analyses provided “limited\ninformation about which to reach conclusions.” Tr. at 571. This was due to the way the\nresearchers reported their results. The researchers stated that “they found a modest\nincreased risk of hospital admission” for the “sickest” children (Tr. at 571 (citing Klein,\nRes. Ex. D at e1144)); however, that category includes amino acid disorders, organic\nacidemias, urea cycle disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, mitochondrial disorders,\n\n160\n   Doctor Wiznitzer also noted the authors’ statement that their findings with “could be because of chance\ngiven the multiple comparison.” Klein, Res. Ex. D at e1145.\n\n\n                                                   90\n\fand glycogen storage diseases (Tr. at 571-72 (citing Klein, Res. Ex. D at e1142, Table\n2)). Because of this aggregation, it is unknown to the reader which conditions in the\n“sickest” category were associated with the increased rates of hospitalization after\nvaccination. Tr. at 572; see also Tr. 575-76. Consequently, “you can’t state that this\nmeans that children with mitochondrial disorders are at increased risk because they’re\nsubsumed within this population.” Tr. at 572. Indeed, it is possible that none of the\n“sickest” children had mitochondrial disorders. Id.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer also pointed out that the researchers urged caution when\ninterpreting their finding “in light of the sparse data with a small number of\nhospitalizations, the lack of a clear association with any particular vaccine, the long time\nperiod over which these hospital events occurred, and the lack of [a] corresponding\nincrease in emergency department visits during the post-vaccine days zero to 14.” Tr.\nat 579-80 (quoting Klein, Res. Ex. D at e1145).\n\n       4. Doctor Cederbaum.\n\n        In his expert report, Dr. Cederbaum stated that he found no evidence that A.A.\n“has a mitochondrial disorder that would predispose her to autism when administered\nthe MMR vaccine.” Res. Ex. A at 5. In reaching his opinion, Dr. Cederbaum evaluated\nthe asserted temporal relationship between A.A.’s vaccination and the onset of her\nautistic symptoms; the validity of her mitochondrial disorder diagnosis; and the\neffectiveness of her prescribed mitochondrial treatment. Id.\n\n       With regard to the temporal relationship, he observed that the reported proximity\nof A.A.’s symptoms to her MMR vaccination compressed over time from two to four\nweeks following vaccination to one to two weeks. Res. Ex. A at 5. He viewed the\nshortened timeline as the sole product of parental report, unsupported by the medical\nrecord. Id. Concerning the mitochondrial diagnosis, he found it to be “based on very\nflimsy evidence that has not been accepted as valid by [those] who work in the area of\ninborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disorders.” Id. at 6. Indeed, the only\nsupport for Dr. Kelley’s diagnostic approach was his own work, which consisted of a\nsingle published paper. Id. (citing Weissman, Pet. Ex. 28).\n\n       As for the prescribed treatment, he noted that mitochondrial cocktails are widely\nviewed as ineffective, albeit harmless. Id. at 7 (citing P. Chinnery and L. Bindoff, 116th\nENMC international workshop: the treatment of mitochondrial disorders, 14th-16th March\n2003, Naarden, The Netherlands, NEUROMUSCULAR DISORD., 13: 757-64 (2003), filed as\nRes. Ex. J [hereinafter “Chinnery, Res. Ex. J”]). He stated that it was unclear in this\ncase why Dr. Kelley thought such treatment would make a difference after the damage\nfrom the acute insult had already been done. Id. at 7-8. In any event, A.A.’s\nimprovement “was not so dramatic as to fairly ascribe it to any intervention.” Id. at 8.\nDoctor Cederbaum concluded: “To the majority of the metabolic world, few would even\nconsider a mitochondrial disorder in this setting.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             91\n\f        At hearing, Dr. Cederbaum reiterated his opinion that A.A. did not have a\nmitochondrial disease. 161 Tr. at 385, 399-400, 408. He stated that Dr. Kelley’s\napproach to diagnosing mitochondrial disease is not nationally or internationally\naccepted or established. Tr. at 388. He explained that mitochondrial disease is\ndiagnosed using standardized criteria in the medical literature, including papers\npublished by Walker, Morava, and Bernier. 162 According to Dr. Cederbaum, these\nstandards were established to provide a common language in the field and prevent\n“intellectual and medical anarchy.” Tr. at 386. He stated that the Walker criteria were\nestablished for just this reason—“people were calling [everything] mitochondrial\ndisease.” Tr. at 386. That problem has now been completely alleviated. Tr. at 386.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum then discussed Pet. Ex. 23B, Dr. Kelley’s unpublished\nmethod for evaluating and treating patients with autism and mitochondrial disease. Tr.\nat 387. Doctor Cederbaum stated that the parameters used by Dr. Kelley generally did\nnot meet any of the standard published criteria. Tr. at 387-88. In his view, the paper\nwas “a very permissive and broadly-based and non[-]literature-supported document.”\nTr. at 388. He did agree with Dr. Kelley that muscle biopsies are unreliable and should\nnot be used as a diagnostic tool. Tr. at 389, 456-57. With regard to Dr. Kelley’s\nreliance on amino acids, Dr. Cederbaum explained that most practitioners would look\ncarefully at alanine levels if they suspected mitochondrial disease, but would not focus\nsolely on amino acids. Tr. at 388. He stated that amino acid levels could be affected by\nfactors other than mitochondrial disease and he “doubted very much whether most\npeople would describe the mitochondria as regulating alanine levels.” Tr. at 389-90.\n\n         Apart from A.A.’s abnormal alanine level, Dr. Cederbaum did not consider any of\nthe lab results to be indicative of mitochondrial disease. 163 Tr. at 390. He confirmed\nthat plasma alanine is a primary biomarker, but stated that it is “not sufficient, in and of\nitself, to make the diagnosis.” Tr. at 392. In A.A.’s case, the elevated result of 634 164\n161\n   Doctor Cederbaum stated that the terms “disease” and “disorder” tend to be used synonymously;\nhowever, strictly speaking, disease typically denotes a more serious abnormality or condition than\ndisorder. See Tr. at 383, 417-18. He defined “mitochondrial disease” as “an abnormality of the\nmitochondria that has some demonstrable effect on the function of the mitochondrion.” Tr. at 383. He\nthen defined “primary mitochondrial disease” as that caused by a mutation—an inborn mutation—in a\nmitochondrial gene. Tr. at 382, 418. He explained that the mutation can occur in genes in the nuclear\ngenome, as well as the mitochondrial genome. Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA can result in\n“heteroplasmy.” Tr. at 382. Doctor Cederbaum explained that heteroplasmy occurs when mutations\naffect some mitochondria and not others, resulting in a “population of normal and abnormal ones.” Tr. at\n460. “[B]ecause it can vary from tissue to tissue and even from parts of one tissue to another, [there] may\n[be] variable symptoms or signs in that tissue, depending on the proportion of abnormal mitochondria.”\nTr. at 460. Primary mitochondrial disease can cause dysfunction ranging from death in the neonatal\nperiod to various chronic disorders. Tr. at 383. He defined “secondary mitochondrial disease” as “any\neffect that does not involve a mutation in a mitochondrial gene but which would appear to affect\nmitochondrial function.” Tr. at 384.\n162\n      Walker, Res. Ex. T; Morava, Res. Ex. U; Bernier, Res. Ex. V.\n163\n      His assessment included the labs from Children’s Hospital, which he viewed as normal. Tr. at 400.\n164\n      Doctor Cederbaum slightly misstated the alanine value as 636. Tr. at 392; see Pet. Ex. 23A.\n\n\n                                                     92\n\fwould have concerned him; however, he would never have ordered the test that gave\nthat result, because the three previous tests were normal. Tr. at 392. Only if he had\nseen that elevated result in the beginning would he have repeated the test. Tr. at 392.\nAccording to Dr. Cederbaum, the single elevated alanine level was not indicative of\nmitochondrial disease, but “it would have been worrisome, and [he] certainly would have\npursued it further.” Tr. at 392.\n\n       Doctor Cederbaum stated that he had never heard of glycine as a primary\nbiomarker for mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 393. He noted that it was not discussed in\nthe published literature on the diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial disease, and Dr.\nKelley’s own paper was yet unpublished. 165 Tr. at 393. In any event, A.A.’s glycine\nlevels were normal. Tr. at 394. As for the purported significance of the alanine and\nglycine ratio, he confessed that he did not fully understand Dr. Kelley’s methods. Tr. at\n394. He noted, for example, that it was not standard practice to normalize data as Dr.\nKelley had done when investigating for possible mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 394.\nNonetheless, he was confident that an elevation in alanine and glycine together would\nnot be sufficient to infer a Complex I deficiency. Tr. at 394-95. 166\n\n        In an effort to demonstrate that various combinations of organic acids have\nrelevance to diagnosing mitochondrial disorders, Dr. Cederbaum was cross-examined\nregarding the Morgan article (T. Morgan, et al., Vaccines Are Not Associated With\nMetabolic Events in Children With Urea Cycle Disorders, PEDIATRICS, 127: e1147-53\n(2012), filed as Res. Ex. C [hereinafter “Morgan, Res. Ex. C”]), which focused on\npatients with urea cycle disorders. Tr. at 432-38. Specifically, he was asked about “the\nthinking behind why glutamine, glycine, alanine, arginine, and citrulline” were measured\nin the study. Tr. at 435. Doctor Cederbaum explained that these amino acids were\nchosen due to their involvement in the urea cycle and he described the importance of\n\n165\n     On cross examination, petitioners’ counsel likened Dr. Kelley’s unpublished methods for diagnosing\nmitochondrial disease in children with autism to Dr. Cederbaum’s pre-publication discovery of the\nmitochondrial condition known as MELAS. Tr. at 419-22. In response to questioning, Dr. Cederbaum\nacknowledged that his work was initially met with some skepticism and that it took a decade for his\ndiscovery to gain acceptance. Tr. at 420-21. He stated, however, that unlike Dr. Kelley, he presented the\nunderlying data in public so other researchers could understand, replicate, and build on his conclusions.\nTr. at 420. He noted that Dr. Kelley has “held these views about mitochondrial disease [for] 15 years,” but\nstill has not disclosed his data. Tr. at 420-21. In response to further questioning, Dr. Cederbaum clarified\nthat he was not criticizing Dr. Kelley’s logic, only his conclusions, which are unproven and unaccepted.\nTr. at 427-28. He encouraged Dr. Kelley to “publish this and verify it and have it pass through peer\nreview and have it catch on.” Tr. at 428. He stated that “it might prove at some time in the future to be\ncorrect,” it is just “not proven to be correct yet, now.” Tr. at 428.\n166\n   Doctor Cederbaum challenged Dr. Kelley’s “observations comparing proven Complex I deficiency and\nthe amino acid levels.” Tr. at 395. He stated that a review of the supplementary data in the Weissman\npaper raised significant concerns in his mind regarding the validity of the conclusions that were drawn.\nTr. at 395; see also Tr. at 422-24 (cross examination questioning whether Dr. Cederbaum viewed the\nresearchers’ institutions as not credible); Tr. at 461-62 (examination by court). Specifically, he examined\nthe data in Supplementary Table 6, which reported the raw data for the muscle biopsies. Tr. at 395. The\nComplex I levels in some of the data “were so surprisingly low . . . that they were unbelievable in\nsomeone who was actually walking around.” Tr. at 395-96.\n\n\n                                                    93\n\feach. Tr. at 435-36. He was then asked whether Dr. Kelley’s methods were analogous,\nas they were likewise based on the measurement of amino acids. Tr. at 436. Doctor\nCederbaum appeared to find it difficult to respond to this question, but explained that\nthe comparison was inapt because “glycine is not known to be involved in the\nrespiratory chain.” Tr. at 436. It is a respiratory chain disorder (Complex I) problem that\nDr. Kelley believed A.A. had.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum was also asked on cross examination to address Dr. Kelley’s\nanalogy of proline to hemoglobin A1c in diabetes. Tr. at 437. In diabetes, hemoglobin\nA1c serves as a biological marker for the average blood sugar levels over a period of\nabout 90 days. See Hennessey, 2009 WL 1709053, at*17 (discussing the diagnostic\nsignificance of rising hemoglobin A1c levels in diabetes). According to Dr. Kelley, proline\nlevels, when precisely measured, could similarly serve as a marker for increased lactate\nlevels over some unspecified period of time. 167 Doctor Cederbaum responded that he\ncould not elaborate on Dr. Kelley’s analogy because it was “not something [he]\nunderst[oo]d or is in the literature.” Tr. at 437. Whether “it” referred to hemoglobin A1c\nor to proline’s utility as a biomarker was not clear in Dr. Cederbaum’s response.\nHowever, it is clear that there is no recognized or accepted crosswalk between proline\nand ETC function, unlike the widely accepted use of hemoglobin A1c levels to convey\naverage blood sugar levels over recent months. 168\n\n       With regard to the plasma lactate levels, Dr. Cederbaum viewed A.A.’s slightly\nelevated results as normal. Tr. at 391. Indeed, he and his colleagues would have\n“ignore[d] even higher values because the frequency of artifact in children 169 is very\nhigh and to follow it up is not so easy.” 170 Tr. at 391. He stated that lactate is a “very\nimportant” biomarker for mitochondrial disease and one he has considered “hundreds of\ntimes” in his years of practice. 171 Tr. at 390; see also Tr. at 400. He noted, however,\nthat the lactate test is highly susceptible to artifact and is typically ordered only when\nthere is a “reasonable prior probability” of mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 390-91.\n\n      Doctor Cederbaum also addressed various other lab results which Dr. Kelley\nviewed as significant. He stated that A.A.’s CO2 levels were not indicative of\n\n167\n      See Tr. at 167-68, 187-88; see also Tr. at 667 (court examination).\n168\n   Because hemoglobin A1c levels are a measurement of blood sugar over a known period of time,\ndiabetic patients no longer need to maintain logs of several-times-daily spot blood sugar testing to show\ntreatment and dietary compliance to their physicians.\n169\n   He explained that children typically are fearful and struggle when their blood is drawn, which greatly\nelevates lactate levels, without being indicative of an underlying mitochondrial problem. Tr. at 391-92.\n170\n   Doctor Cederbaum noted that a routine and reliable alternative would be to “collect the lactate and\npyruvate [together] . . . under conditions that we would call rest. And we have a specific protocol for\ndoing that.” Tr. at 391.\n171\n     He was surprised that Drs. Kelley and Zimmerman “dismissed the lactate as being unimportant when\nit’s one of the primary biomarkers for mitochondrial disease.” Tr. at 393.\n\n\n                                                      94\n\fmitochondrial disease. Tr. at 396. Indeed, according to Dr. Cederbaum, CO2 levels are\nnot a primary biomarker for mitochondrial disease or “even a primary biomarker for\nmetabolic disease in general.” Tr. at 396. Similarly, creatine kinase is not a primary\nbiomarker for mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 397. He also stated that he was not aware\nof any peer-reviewed literature that identified AST or the AST-ALT ratio as a primary\nmarker for mitochondrial disease in the general population. Tr. at 398-99. Doctor\nCederbaum stated that he was open-minded toward the idea that the AST-ALT ratio or\ncreatine levels could be valid criterion for at least suspecting mitochondrial disorder,\nhowever, they are not presently criteria published in the medical literature. Tr. at 398-\n99. He would not accept them as diagnostic of mitochondrial disorder. Tr. at 398-99. I\nnote that this testimony was effectively unrebutted, as no peer-reviewed literature filed\nidentified these tests as primary biomarkers for mitochondrial disease. In his view, none\nof A.A.’s lab results were indicative of a likely Complex I deficiency. Tr. at 400-01.\n\n       In response to additional questioning, Dr. Cederbaum stated that he had not\npreviously heard that a reaction to L-carnitine could be a diagnostic indicator of a\nComplex I deficiency. 172 Tr. at 401. He stated that the basis for Dr. Kelley’s assertion\nthat L-carnitine activates Complex I was not apparent. Tr. at 401. As for the use of\nvitamin cocktails, Dr. Cederbaum stated that he does not view them as an effective\ntreatment. 173 Tr. at 403. He acknowledged that Dr. Zimmerman and Mr. Allen\ndescribed apparent temporally related improvement; however, a cause and effect\nrelationship has not been shown. Tr. at 404.\n\n       Doctor Cederbaum also indicated that mitochondrial PDD or mitochondrial\nautism was not an established diagnosis in the metabolic community, but noted that a\n“cohort of individuals” around the country believe it is valid. Tr. at 404. The majority of\nthe community does not view it as a legitimate diagnosis, however, especially in light of\nnewer techniques, such as “whole exome sequencing, that have found presumed\nmutations in autism, [which] don’t include mitochondrial genes, but they do include\n172\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Cederbaum stated that carnitine is not known to cause seizures;\nthus, in his view, the relationship between A.A.’s treatment with carnitine and her seizures is solely a\ntemporal one. Tr. at 465.\n173\n   On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum reiterated that this “type of treatment . . . has been used for\nyears, [but] there’s no compelling evidence it really works.” Tr. at 459 (citing Chinnery, Res. Ex. J); see\nalso Tr. at 459-60 (citing S. Yazdani, et al. eds, CHRONIC COMPLEX DISEASES OF CHILDHOOD: A PRACTICAL\nGUIDE FOR CLINICIANS (2011), filed as Pet. Ex. 74 [hereinafter “Yazdani, Pet. Ex. 74”], at 185). I queried\nDr. Cederbaum about why vitamin cocktails would be used if there is no evidence that it works. Tr. at\n462-64. In his view:\n\n        [P]hysicians have a very low tolerance for being able to say, ‘I do nothing.’ So, there’s\n        this suspicion that vitamins can’t possibly be harmful, and . . . you can develop a rationale\n        for why a cocktail of these substances might work, and you throw in carnitine, which has\n        a lesser rationale; you throw in thiamine, which we know most affects the pyruvate\n        dehydrogenation and not the mitochondria; you throw in riboflavin because it’s a cofactor\n        for Complex II; Co-Q is an electron transporter, and it may be if you throw in Co-Q, you’ll\n        bypass a block.”\n\nTr. at 462.\n\n                                                     95\n\fgenes that have to do with brain development and synaptic formation.” Tr. at 404. He\nnoted that such testing was not available in 2002. Tr. at 405-06. Genetic testing for\nmitochondrial disease was not performed on A.A. Tr. at 406.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum agreed that a person with a mitochondrial\ndisorder could display signs and symptoms of autism. Tr. at 418. In his view, autism is\n“a symptom complex . . . caused by a lot of different things.” Tr. at 418. As such, he\nfound no inherent reason why “you couldn’t have some [mitochondrial] patients who\ndisplay that symptom complex.” Tr. at 418.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum discussed A.A.’s treatment with valproate (Depakote). Tr. at\n406-08; see also Tr. at 438-46 (cross). He stated that valproate is “absolutely not”\nrecommended for patients with mitochondrial disease, because it has “been known for\nmany years . . . [as] a mitochondrial toxin.” Tr. at 406. He explained that a physician\n“would never use it” if he or she suspected mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 406. He stated\nthat if A.A. had a mitochondrial disease he would have expected to see an elevation of\nlactate and pyruvate, as well as a physical reaction to Depakote. Tr. at 407-08. He\nreferenced several medical articles174 that reported “severely abnormal reactions to\nvalproate [Depakote], sometimes when they knew that it was a mitochondrial disease\nand used it inadvertently or ignorantly, and sometimes [when] the suspicion of\nmitochondrial disease was not raised until [after the] horrible reaction.” Tr. at 406.\nGiven this contraindication, Dr. Cederbaum questioned why A.A.’s physicians would\nprescribe Depakote to treat her seizures, which were not severe, when “there’s a whole\npharmacopeia of available anticonvulsants.” Tr. at 408; see also Tr. at 440-41 (cross).\nIn his opinion, they were “either woefully ignorant or they didn’t believe that [she had] a\nmitochondrial disorder in the first place.” Tr. at 408.\n\n       In response to questioning on cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum stated that it\nwas possible that some mitochondrial disorders would be permissive of valproate. Tr.\nat 440. However, the current standard of care is to avoid the drug unless the patient\nhas a “desperate, desperate, intractable seizure disorder.” Tr. at 441. A.A. did not have\na severe, untreatable seizure disorder. Tr. at 440. Doctor Cederbaum was asked to\nconfirm that valproate had not worsened A.A.’s mitochondrial dysfunction. Tr. at 441.\nHe responded that that was true “because she didn’t have a mitochondrial disorder. Tr.\n\n174\n    J.

He elaborated that her condition did not “get materially worse” and her irritability\ncould not be ascribed “one way or another to a mitochondrial condition.” Tr. at 441. He\nalso confirmed that, based on her AST levels, the drug did not affect her liver function.\nTr. at 441-46.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum was asked to address possible and known stressors in\nmitochondrial disease. Tr. at 409. He explained that “[a]ll inborn errors have stressors\nthat appear to exacerbate them,” although many remain unidentified. Tr. at 409. He\nstated that intercurrent illnesses, such as respiratory infection or a urinary tract infection,\nare known stressors of mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 410. As for vaccines, he stated\nthat they are not known stressors, but “are always given with caution.” Tr. at 411-13\n(citing Morgan, Res. Ex. C; Klein, Res. Ex. D).\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum reiterated that infections are known\nmetabolic stressors. Tr. at 429. He also acknowledged that metabolic decompensation\nhas been reported following immunization. Tr. at 429-30, 456. Asked whether he saw\n“any correlation between infections and what happens after an immunization,” he\nresponded that there is “an inflammatory component to both, [but] we have not yet in\nmedicine defined [that] inflammatory component . . . that might in some instances cause\na metabolic deterioration.” Tr. at 430. Concerning the putative “window of vulnerability”\ndiscussed by Dr. Kelley, he noted that Dr. Kelley’s window of vulnerability “occurs when\nwe know that the onset of autism is most common. So, it could be just cotemporal”—\n“they are not necessarily related as cause and effect.” Tr. at 431.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum addressed several research articles submitted by Dr.\nZimmerman pertaining to mitochondrial dysfunction and autism. Tr. at 413-16 (citing\nTang, Pet. Ex. 65; Anitha, Pet. Ex. 66; Ginsberg, Pet. Ex. 67; D. Rossignol and R. Frye,\nMitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis, MOLEC. PSYCHIAT., 17: 290-314 (2012), filed as Pet. Ex. 68 [hereinafter\n“Rossingnol, Pet. Ex. 68”]; Chauhan, Pet. Ex. 69). Doctor Cederbaum stated that he\nhad read the articles, but viewed them as uninformative because petitioners’ stated\nhypothesis relates to “a primary genetic abnormality,\" whereas the data in the articles\nrelates to “a secondary abnormality”—it is “apples and oranges.” Tr. at 416. In his\nopinion, the data from the articles simply “are not interpretable or applicable at this time\nto this case.” Tr. at 416.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum was asked about the Walker (Res. Ex. T),\nMorava (Res. Ex. U), and Bernier (Res. Ex. V) articles, which discuss diagnostic criteria\nfor mitochondrial disorders. Tr. at 446-47. In response to questioning, Dr. Cederbaum\nconfirmed that the Walker criteria were developed for adults, but noted that it was later\nexpanded by Morava and Bernier. Tr. at 446-47. He acknowledged that the criteria\noutlined in the papers were propositional at the time; however, he indicated that there is\nnow general acceptance of the criteria as applicable to both patient populations. Tr. at\n448-49. There are practitioners, though, such as Dr. Kelley, who “fe[el] no compunction\nabout applying [their] own criteria,” so acceptance is not universal. Tr. at 449. When\nasked to clarify what he meant by Dr. Kelley’s own criteria, he responded the “ones that\n\n\n                                              97\n\falanine and glycine elevation alone, with creatine kinase and AST-ALT ratio are\nsufficient to diagnose a mild form of [mitochondrial disorder].” Tr. at 449.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum elaborated on the various criteria\ndiscussed in the articles. Tr. at 449. As an initial matter, he noted that the articles were\nwritten for the population that studies this area, so they sometimes are “almost like a\nshorthand”—the authors assume those reading the article have a basic familiarity with\nthe concepts and theories underlying the research. Tr. at 450. So “[w]hen you talk\nabout metabolic abnormalities, lactate, pyruvate, and alanine are understood as being a\ncriterion.” Tr. at 450-51. Doctor Cederbaum was then questioned about alanine as a\nsubstitute marker for pyruvate. He responded that alanine was “absolutely not” a\nsubstitute, but “a reflection of pyruvate.” Tr. at 451. He continued that “nobody would\nsuggest that it’s a substitute. In fact, alanine can be elevated in circumstances in which\npyruvate is normal.” Tr. at 451. As an example, he explained that\n\n       in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, where there is no oxidative\n       problem, the lactate-pyruvate ratio is normal as it would be in someone\n       without any metabolic disorder, whereas generally, in mitochondrial\n       disorders, where there’s an oxidative problem, you may have elevated\n       alanine, but the lactate-pyruvate ratio will be distorted in favor of lactate,\n       because of the oxidation.\n\nTr. at 451-52; see also S. Yazdani, et al. eds, CHRONIC COMPLEX DISEASES OF\nCHILDHOOD: A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR CLINICIANS (2011), filed as Pet. Ex. 74 [hereinafter\n“Yazdani, Pet. Ex. 74”] (textbook chapters Dr. Cederbaum wrote on disorders of\npyruvate metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency). He also confirmed that\n“you [can] have a normal lactate and pyruvate level and still have a mitochondrial\nproblem.” Tr. at 453.\n\n       In response to additional questioning on cross examination about his textbook\nchapters, Dr. Cederbaum agreed that there were a wide range of symptoms that can\nappear in a mitochondrial disorder. Tr. at 455 (citing Yazdani, Pet. Ex. 74). He also\nagreed that both single and multisystem organs can be affected in a respiratory chain\ndisorder. Tr. at 455. He confirmed that the onset of symptoms in the multisystem\ndisorder can appear at different times—for example, the brain symptoms could appear\nbefore the gastrointestinal symptoms. Tr. at 456.\n\n       Doctor Cederbaum was cross-examined regarding the use of ratios for\ncomparing biochemical markers in metabolic research. Tr. at 454. He confirmed that\ntheir use is “perfectly reasonable” and, when valid, can help researchers identify and\ncorrect false positives in test results. Tr. at 454. Doctor Cederbaum acknowledged that\nDr. Kelley’s use of ratios was done for this reason; however, he did not indicate whether\nhe believed the ratios to be valid. Tr. at 455.\n\n       On cross examination, petitioners’ counsel recalled that Dr. Cederbaum agreed\nwith Dr. Kelley that muscle biopsies are unreliable and should not be used as a\n\n\n                                              98\n\fdiagnostic tool. Tr. at 457. She then noted that muscle biopsy results were classified\nas one of the major criteria in Walker and asked Dr. Cederbaum what criterion has\ntaken its place. Tr. at 457 (citing Walker, Res. Ex. T at 264). He responded that the\nsubstitute criterion “would be persistent, really unequivocal elevations in lactate, and a\nmultisystem disease.” Tr. at 457. He noted, however, that “the bar” has really been\n“raised by the newer technologies. So that now there’s no way to diagnose a\nmitochondrial disorder without doing whole exome [analysis], which will look at both the\nmitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome.” Tr. at 457.\n\n        At the conclusion of his testimony, I asked Dr. Cederbaum if in summary it would\nbe correct to say that he did not view Dr. Kelley’s hypotheses as wrong, just not proven.\nTr. at 466. He affirmed my statement. Tr. at 466. I then asked him whether by “not\nproven” he meant “not probable or not certain or just that we don’t know.” Tr. at 466.\nDoctor Cederbaum responded that when a scientist proposes something, the onus is on\nthat person “to demonstrate or prove . . . the veracity of what they’re proposing.” Tr. at\n466. With regard to Dr. Kelley’s hypotheses, “there is a way of doing that now, and that\nwould be whole exome [analysis].” Tr. at 466. He stated that Dr. Kelley “ought to be\nfiguring out a way to pay for whole exome sequencing” to determine whether any of his\npatients have mitochondrial gene mutations. Tr. at 466. Doctor Cederbaum recognized\nthat a patient could have a mitochondrial disorder and also have normal exome results,\nwith no abnormality in a mitochondrial gene; however, he reiterated that the onus is on\nDr. Kelley to show “that some of these patients have a mitochondrial gene that’s\nmutated.” Tr. at 466-67. Such findings would allow a reasonable inference that some\nothers might have mutations as well. Tr. at 466-67.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum also emphasized the importance of publication and\nreproducibility. Tr. at 467-68. He explained that publication exposes an idea to a\nknowledgeable community and allows them to review and pass judgment on it. Tr. at\n467. Publication generally represents acceptance by scientific peers. Tr. at 467.\nAlthough “correct ideas may [initially] get rejected, . . . they won’t get rejected always,\nand you can get anything published today,” especially with so many options available.\nTr. at 467.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum also explained that reproducibility—the ability of others to\nduplicate the results—factors into whether an idea is considered proven or established.\nTr. at 467-68. He explained, for example, that a paper on Dr. Kelley’s theory would\nprovide the “biochemical data alongside whole exome data, and maybe because it’s\nautism, [there would be] a comparative genome hybridization.” Tr. at 468. This would\nallow “someone else [to] take their series of patients and replicate it”—they would try to\nrepeat what Dr. Kelley says he has done. Tr. at 468. Unfortunately, in its current form,\nDr. Kelley’s methods and theories cannot be replicated or confirmed. Tr. at 468.\n\n                                  VII. Factual Findings.\n\n       I have carefully considered the record as a whole in arriving at the factual\nfindings set forth below.\n\n\n                                             99\n\fA. Pre-Vaccination.\n\n        1. Pre-Vaccination Health.\n\n       During her first 15 months of life, A.A. suffered multiple minor illnesses, including\nrespiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and OM. She was physically normal upon\nexamination at each of her well child visits through 12 months of age. She also was\nphysically normal at her 15-month visit, except for fluid-filled tympanic membranes\nindicative of an ear infection. A.A. suffered from chronic ear infections.\n\n        2. Pre-Vaccination Development.\n\n       A.A. had symptoms of ASD prior to the administration of the October 23, 2000\nMMR vaccination. Although she developed normally during her first year of life and\nachieved expected milestones, by 15 months of age A.A. had possessed few if any\nfunctional words. Although the Denver II reflected three words, the video evidence\nsuggested a very limited vocabulary.\n\n        I do not accept the testimony of A.A.’s father and aunt that she possessed\nbetween 12 and 100 words by 15 months of age, or that she had the ability to name\ncolors, count, or tell “knock-knock” jokes. 175 Their statements are contrary to more\nreliable contemporaneous evidence, including earlier parental reports and video taken\nduring the period in question.\n\n      Petitioners provided histories closer in time to the described events (and before\nthey began to blame the MMR vaccine for A.A.’s problems), which indicated that A.A.\nspoke very few words by 15 months of age and primarily made animal, and other oral\nsounds, which lacked meaning. 176 These reports were confirmed by the video evidence\nrecorded on October 14, 2000, wherein she vocalized but spoke no words, including\n“ma-ma” and “da-da.” 177\n\n175\n   I credit Dr. Wiznitzer’s testimony that it would be “highly, highly unlikely” for a child that age to have\nsuch a vocabulary due to the way language develops and also “the immaturity of the oral motor\nmechanism in terms of verbalization.” Tr. at 535-36 (cross). In his many years of practice he could not\nrecall ever meeting a child who had 24 words at 15 months of age—“functional words that they use\nindependently.” Tr. at 536. Even Dr. Zimmerman conceded that A.A.’s reported ability to name colors\nwas probably overstated based on the level of development he saw on the video. Tr. at 357-59.\n176\n   See, e.g., Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5 (parental report at speech and language evaluation on September 5, 2001,\nthat A.A. spoke “her first word ‘Quack’ at 1 year and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15\nmonths”); Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96 (parental report to Dr. Lavenstein on September 16, 2001, that A.A. “had some\noral sounds” in October 2000, “but then subsequently regressed”); Pet. Ex. 6, p. 25 (parental report to Dr.\nRaymond on February 13, 2002, that prior to approximately 16 months of age, she “was able to make\n‘animal sounds’ such as ‘roar!’ when asked, and was able to state her age”).\n177\n   With regard to A.A.’s language development as seen in the video, Dr. Zimmerman—petitioners’ own\nexpert—testified that she was “not forming words,” but “making word sounds.” Tr. at 297-98. In later\ntestimony, he recalled her “babbling some word sounds” during the video, but no other specific words. Tr.\n\n                                                      100\n\f       A.A. also exhibited abnormal behavior for a 15 month old child. In the October\n14 video, A.A. demonstrated normal gross motor skills and an appropriate interest in her\nsurroundings; however, the quality and level of her interpersonal interactions with her\nparents was diminished. As Dr. Wiznitzer observed, she did not seek to be picked up\nand held by her parents and made limited eye contact. 178 She also engaged in hand\nflapping—a stereotypy commonly seen in autistic individuals. 179\n\n       According to Dr. Zimmerman, A.A.’s behavior appeared normal in “all respects”\nand he specifically disagreed with Dr. Wiznitzer that she exhibited any hand flapping\nduring the video. 180 Although he did note other repetitive movements, he explained\nthem away, stating that abnormal motor behaviors and stereotypies almost always\ncome after loss of language and relatedness—there is a “hierarchy of symptoms” in\nASD. 181 Later, however, he stated that stereotypies can come before loss of language,\nespecially in a child who develops autism early. 182 But he maintained that A.A. was not\nsuch a child because “her development was normal” and the behaviors were simply the\n“immature movements” of a young child. 183\n\n       I find Dr. Wiznitzer’s testimony more persuasive on the nature of AA’s behavior\non the videos, particularly in view of his clinical experience. Although both pediatric\nneurologists were well-qualified to opine on ASD, it appears to me that Dr.\nZimmerman’s focus in research has been on biochemical and cellular differences\nbetween those with ASD and those with typical development, whereas Dr. Wiznitzer’s\nfocus has been on ASD behaviors, co-morbidities, and diagnosis. See Pet. Ex. 26, pp.\n16-24 (Dr. Zimmerman’s publications) and Res. Ex. L, pp. 13-23 (Dr. Wiznitzer’s\npublications). Doctor Wiznitzer’s testimony tracked what I observed on the videos.\n\nB. Post-Vaccination Health.\n\n           1. Health.\n\nat 344 (cross). Even if one accepts that “moo” is a functional word, as Dr. Zimmerman contended, A.A.\nstill had fewer words than would be expected for a 15 month old child. See Tr. at 677.\n178\n   Although Dr. Zimmerman commented that A.A. appeared to be “making eye contact with the person\nwho’s taking the film,” he conceded that he could not know whether she was making eye contact with her\nparents or simply looking at the camera. Tr. at 345 (cross).\n179\n  Doctor Zimmerman later observed this behavior first-hand during an early follow-up visit on July 15,\n2002. See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n180\n      Tr. at 299.\n181\n      Tr. at 676-77.\n182\n      Tr. at 681.\n183\n      Tr. at 681-82.\n\n\n                                                  101\n\f      A.A.’s first medical visit following her MMR vaccination was on December 18,\n2000, when she was approximately 17 months old. She was treated for a viral infection\nand early OM.\n\n      Prior to that visit, she was not seen or otherwise treated for any illness or medical\nconcern—a nearly two-month period after the MMR vaccination.\n\n        I find that A.A. was not ill as the result of her MMR vaccination. I do not accept\nMr. Allen’s testimony that A.A. developed a fever on the night of October 29, 2000, or\nthat he or his wife called A.A.’s pediatrician seeking advice. There is no record of the\nfever or of the telephone call. A spiking fever, which reportedly lasted four days, would\nlikely have been noted somewhere by her pediatrician—especially if they called twice,\nas asserted. 184\n\n       Petitioners had previously consulted a pediatrician in person when A.A. was ill. It\nis counter-intuitive that that would not have done so when she spiked a fever lasting\nfour days. It was petitioners’ custom to take A.A. in for office examinations whenever\nshe was sick, regardless of symptoms. As such, it is very unlikely that petitioners would\nsimply have called the pediatrician in this instance. 185\n\n        As was the case prior to her vaccination, A.A. suffered from chronic OM. The\nmedical records reflect that between her first post-vaccination appointment on\nDecember 18, 2000, and her two-year well child visit on August 6, 2001, she was\ndiagnosed with five ear infections. Other illnesses during this period included viral\ninfection, URI, and UTI.\n\n           2. Developmental Regression\n\n      A.A. did not experience an abrupt deterioration of her development after the\nMMR vaccination. Based on contemporaneous medical records, nearly two months\nelapsed before she returned to her pediatrician (December 18, 2000), and even then\nnothing was observed or reported as to a loss of skills or other significant behavioral\nchange.\n\n        The first report of any developmental concern was more than four months after\nthe MMR vaccination, on March 1, 2001, when A.A. was seen for her 18-month well\nchild visit. 186 At that visit, her health care provider noted that she had not achieved\n\n184\n      See Tr. at 79-80.\n185\n   Petitioners took A.A. to the pediatrician for the same symptoms—high fever, irritability, and refusal to\neat—on November 11, 1999, at four months of age. They were instructed at that visit about the\nseriousness of a fever exceeding 100 degrees and of symptoms lasting more than three days. See Pet.\nEx. 9, p. 62.\n186\n      As previously noted, A.A. was more than 19 months old at the time of the visit.\n\n\n                                                      102\n\fsome of the expected milestones, and her mother expressed concern about her\nlanguage skills and withdrawing behavior. Her concern about A.A.’s social and\nlanguage development had likely grown over time, as A.A.’s mother did not mention any\nabrupt deterioration or point at which her concern crystalized, and did indicate that there\nhad been a problem (attributed to the prior nanny) over several months, and that A.A,\nwas opening up more with the new nanny. A.A. had 4-10 words (the Denver II chart at\nPet. Ex. 9, p. 7 reflected 6 or more words) at this visit, suggesting an increase in\nvocabulary, although there was a concern about consistency in her language.\n\n       Over the next few months, A.A. returned to the doctor for various illnesses,\nincluding a series of ear infections. On May 7, 2001, her pediatrician formally assessed\nher with delayed speech. The diagnosis was repeated at her two-year well child visit on\nAugust 6, 2001, and she was referred for speech evaluation.\n\n       At the speech evaluation, which took place on September 5, 2001, petitioners\nreported that A.A. “stopped speaking after having 3 ear infections in a row” 187—the last\nof which occurred nearly six months after vaccination.\n\n       Although Mr. Allen testified to an alternate, condensed timeline, supported by the\ntestimony of Ms. Edick, involving abrupt changes in A.A.’s behavior within one to two\nweeks of her MMR vaccination, including loss of language, flattened emotions,\ndecreased eye contact, and diminished social interactions, I do not credit their\ntestimony. I am certain that these changes occurred, as they were noted in later\nevaluations, but I do not find it probable that they occurred abruptly within a few weeks\nof the MMR vaccination.\n\n       Rather, I find it likely that A.A.’s behavioral problems began to be more\nnoticeable as she got older. The Christmas 2000 video showed behavioral differences\nsuggestive of ASD, but to her parents, they likely represented toddler obstinacy and\ntantrums. Certainly, they were not mentioned at the March well-child visit or in the\nseveral histories provided before Mr. Allen’s internet research prior to a call to\nCountryside in mid-January 2002.\n\n        Doctor Zimmerman testified that he observed behavioral changes between the\nOctober 14 and October 29 videos that correlated with Mr. Allen’s report that A.A.\n“changed within one to two weeks after the MMR immunization.” 188 He stated that the\nrapidity of A.A.’s regression was “striking” and “somewhat unusual.” 189 In response to\nquestioning he discussed the role of environment on behavior and recognized that the\nvideos were shot in different settings; 190 however, he did not think that was a factor in\n187\n      Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5.\n188\n      Tr. at 302-03.\n189\n      Tr. at 349.\n190\n      Tr. at 355-56.\n\n\n                                            103\n\fthis case. 191 He also acknowledged that the abnormal behavior he identified in the\nvideo (e.g., lack of expression, diminished interest) could have been due to the illness\nthat was reflected in the medical records from her 15-month visit. 192\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer, on the other hand, saw no evidence of a rapid regression or\nany significant behavioral changes. 193 He elaborated that A.A.’s behavior at the\npumpkin patch on October 14 was strikingly similar to her behavior at the Halloween\nparty on October 29. 194 He also explained that any perceived differences in A.A.’s\nbehavior while at home on October 14 as compared to that at the Halloween party were\nlargely attributable to her age and personality and not evidence of a major change. 195\nHe stated that what was important from a developmental perspective was her evident\nawareness of her surroundings and of the people around her. 196 My own observations\nand conclusions are in accord with Dr. Wiznitzer’s.\n\n       Both experts agreed that by Christmastime A.A.’s behavior was clearly\nabnormal—she did not vocalize, had diminished social interaction, and engaged in\ninappropriate play. 197 However, their opinions differed as to whether the behavior was a\ncontinuum of deterioration from that seen in later October. 198 In Dr. Zimmerman’s view,\n“her condition five days after [vaccination] appeared to persist.”199 Doctor Wiznitzer\nindicated that there was insufficient evidence to find that the behaviors were a\nprogression. 200\n\n       In view of all of the evidence of record, I do not find the testimony offered by Mr.\nAllen and Ms. Edick with respect to the timeline of A.A.’s developmental deterioration to\n\n\n\n191\n      Tr. at 679.\n192\n   Tr. at 353-54; see also Tr. at 301 (Doctor Zimmerman commenting that in the October 29 video, A.A.\nlooked as though she did not feel well).\n193\n      Tr. at 493, 495.\n194\n   Tr. at 495; see also Tr. at 493 (explaining that he focused on those segments due to the similarity of\nthe environment).\n195\n  Tr. at 490 (noting a “clear difference” between her behavior and social interactions when she was at\nhome as compared to outside in public, but attributing it to stranger anxiety and shyness).\n196\n      Tr. at 494-95.\n197\n      Tr. at 303 (Dr. Zimmerman); 541-42, 605-08 (Dr. Wiznitzer).\n198\n      Tr. at 303-04 (Dr. Zimmerman); 608 (Dr. Wiznitzer).\n199\n      Tr. at 303-04.\n200\n      Tr. at 608.\n\n\n                                                     104\n\fbe reliable. I do not question their honesty; 201 I do question their recall. This was a\nfamily with easy access to health care, with a nanny who could take A.A. to the doctor\nwhen her parents were working. Despite the extremely concerning changes\ndescribed, 202 petitioners did not contact A.A.’s doctor or voice concern to any other\nmedical professional. 203 And when she was treated on December 18 for a viral infection\nand early OM, these troubling developments went unmentioned. This makes no sense.\n\n       As I noted above, petitioners were consistent in taking A.A. to the doctor when\nshe was sick, including for very minor illnesses. That they would not have reached out\nto A.A.’s pediatrician in these circumstances is inexplicable. Indeed, I note that even\nafter Mr. Allen began blaming the MMR vaccination for A.A.’s problems, the timeline\nbetween vaccination and onset was different. He reported to A.A.’s physician in early\n2002: “Her behavior started 30 days post MMR.” 204\n\n        I emphasize that I have a great deal of respect for Dr. Zimmerman as a physician\nand expert. However, I think his view of the events post-vaccination were based on and\nshaped by the history he was provided at the initial visit. The history of a rapid\nregression, one he thought atypical of ASD, meshed with his research interest in\nmitochondrial disorders and ASD. He ordered testing, and eventually treatment.\nLetting go of the basis for this course of events could be difficult. However, setting\naside the history he had been provided, when he was asked to identify medical\nevidence showing developmental abnormalities or changed behavior shortly after\nvaccination, he could not do so. 205 Doctor Zimmerman also stated that if he were to\nbase his opinion only on the October 14 and December 25 videos, without regard to the\nOctober 29 video, he would not characterize the behavioral changes he observed as\nrapid. 206 I asked him that question because of the testimony of Dr. Wiznitzer and my\nown observations that A.A.’s behavior at the pumpkin patch looked a lot like her\nbehavior at the Halloween parade and party.\n201\n   The only area in which I question Mr. Allen’s honesty is in the claim than no other videos of A.A.\nexisted, particularly in view of his testimony that he filmed her frequently.\n202\n   See Tr. at 119 (Ms. Edick stated that the behavior she saw on Veterans Day weekend “really affected\n[her].” She could not remember saying anything about her concerns to the petitioners; however, she did\nrecall discussing it with her own parents.). This, too, is inexplicable. As close as the family apparently\nwas, and given Ms. Edick’s training in special education, I find it very difficult to accept that she would\nnot—gently—have mentioned that some of A.A.’s behaviors should be discussed with her pediatrician.\nGiven petitioners’ response to the speech therapist’s suggestion that she might have ASD (she saw an\nASD specialist at Children’s Hospital in Washington, DC just 11 days later) I cannot imagine that they\nwould not have responded equally quickly to a suggestion or observation that A.A.’s behaviors were not\nnormal.\n203\n   See Tr. at 81-82; see also Tr. at 45 (In retrospect, Mr. Allen wished that he had called the doctor, but\nstated that he was not sure what he would have said.).\n204\n      Pet. Ex. 9, p. 35.\n205\n      Tr. at 348.\n206\n      Tr. at 353 (“Three months would not be rapid, no.”).\n\n\n                                                      105\n\f        Instead, I credit Dr. Wiznitzer’s opinion, as it is consistent with the\ncontemporaneous medical records. Doctor Wiznitzer persuasively explained that A.A.\nhad early signs of autism prior to vaccination 207 and that her subsequent autistic\npresentation was not atypical. 208 He testified that autism usually manifests between\nage one and two years, but symptoms are always present before age three. 209 He also\ntestified that autistic regression is not an abrupt occurrence; 210 instead, language and\nsocial skills are lost over a period of weeks to months. 211 In his view, A.A’s autistic\npresentation followed this course, beginning with delayed speech prior to vaccination\nand continuing with a gradual deterioration of social skills and other behaviors. 212 Her\neventual ASD diagnosis was fully supported by the medical records. 213\n\nC. Diagnosis of Mitochondrial Disease, Disorder, or Dysfunction.\n\n       The preponderant evidence does not support a finding that A.A. has or had a\nmitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. Doctor Kelley’s diagnosis was not\nmade using established criteria, but an unpublished method that has not been peer-\nreviewed, adopted by other laboratories, or recognized as a valid diagnostic approach\nby the mitochondrial community at large. 214 Indeed, Dr. Kelley himself stated that A.A.\nwould not meet the criteria for a mitochondrial diagnosis using established criteria. 215\n\n       Early in his treatment, Dr. Zimmerman suspected that A.A. “might have\nmitochondrial problems.” 216 The basis for this belief was her “apparently rapid\ndeterioration following her MMR vaccin[ation]”—a pattern he claimed he had seen in\nother children with mitochondrial problems. 217\n\n207\n      Tr. at 500-01.\n208\n      Tr. at 500.\n209\n      Tr. at 497.\n210\n   Tr. at 597-602 (also commenting that “an overnight story” would lead him to “start looking for other\ndisorders”).\n211\n      Tr. at 600-01.\n212\n  Tr. at 500 (also stating that even “a relatively rapid regression” would still be “within the framework of\nwhat’s been described for the population”).\n213\n      Tr. at 499.\n214\n      Tr. at 388 (Dr. Cederbaum)\n215\n      Tr. at 252.\n216\n      Tr. at 306-07.\n217\n  Tr. at 307. One of the difficulties with this correlation is that regression in autism is not infrequent.\nSee Dwyer, 2010 WL 892250, at *37-40; Synder, 2009 WL 332044, at *39-42; see e.g., Dwyer, 2010 WL\n\n                                                     106\n\f       I accept and acknowledge that Drs. Kelley and Zimmerman were treating\nphysicians. Their decision to treat A.A. based on the diagnosis of “mitochondrial\nautism” that they reached certainly attests to their belief in the diagnosis. Their belief\nthat she improved on such treatment is more difficult to assess and credit, as they\nacknowledged her positive response could not be separated from the effect of other\ntherapies she was concurrently receiving. And, to the extent that her improvement was\nbased on subjective assessments, I note that petitioners thought A.A. improved on\nchelation therapy, too, which was designed to remove heavy metals, not treat\nmitochondrial problems.\n\n       Genetic testing for mitochondrial defects was negative. That is not uncommon,\neven in children with symptoms meeting the mainstream diagnostic criteria. With the\nexception of one high alanine level on testing ordered in 2003 (after three earlier tests\nfor alanine were normal), A.A. had none of the classic markers for mitochondrial\ndisease. Although Drs. Zimmerman and Kelley thought there was a history of a sudden\nregression post MMR vaccination, based solely on parental histories, I have found that\nthere was no sudden regression.\n\n       Essentially, the “mitochondrial autism” diagnosis rests on the unpublished\nresearch of Dr. Kelley and the anecdotal observations of Dr. Zimmerman. And, Dr.\nKelley’s opinion is, in essence, based on his re-evaluation and “normalization” of the\nfindings of one outside laboratory, which reported A.A.’s results as normal, and on the\ntest results from his own laboratory, which he acknowledged were not accepted by the\nmitochondrial disease community at large.\n\n      At hearing, Dr. Kelley testified at length about his diagnostic approach, but was\nunable to cogently explain his method, which involved opaque calculations, 218 obscure\nprotocols, 219 and data accessible only to him. 220 Although he borrowed some elements\n\n\n\n\n892250, at *63-77; Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *142-47; C. Johnson, et al., Identification and Evaluation\nof Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder, PEDIATRICS 120(5): 1183-1215 (2007), filed as Res. Ex. M\n[“Johnson, Res. Ex. M”], at 1192. The MMR vaccination is commonly given at 12-15 months of age, a\ntime frame when ASD symptoms often emerge. When anecdotal data connecting regression to the MMR\nis cited, it is difficult to determine if the correlation is suggestive of causation or merely coincidental. This\nproblem with Dr. Zimmerman’s data was discussed by Dr. Wiznitzer in his testimony, including references\nto the epidemiologic studies on which he relied. The epidemiology was also extensively discussed in the\nTheory 1 OAP decisions. See, e.g.,Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *142-47; see also Johnson, Res. Ex. M\nat 1184-86.\n218\n      See, e.g., Tr. at 159-60; 165-67; 635-45 (normalized ratios to mean values).\n219\n      See, e.g., Tr. at 162, 164 (four-hour fasting blood sample).\n220\n      See, e.g., Tr. at 167; 654-55 (underlying data for certain values not disclosed or publicly available).\n\n\n                                                        107\n\fof published diagnostic criteria, 221 other aspects of his analysis were of his own\ndesign, 222 without support. 223\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer expressed significant concerns with Dr. Kelley’s “very unclear”\ndiagnostic methodology. 224 In particular, he questioned the validity of certain calculated\nvalues, the acceptance of unusually high standard deviations, and the application of\nnormal range values to test results from other labs. 225 He viewed Dr. Kelley’s data and\ncalculations with extreme reservation—indeed, he found it difficult to “state that th[e]\ninformation ha[d] any value.”226\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum testified that A.A.’s mitochondrial diagnosis was “based on\nvery flimsy evidence that has not been accepted as valid by [those] who work in the\narea of inborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disorders.”227 He stated that Dr.\nKelley’s approach to diagnosing mitochondrial disease is not nationally or internationally\naccepted or established. 228 Mitochondrial conditions are diagnosed using standardized\ncriteria in the medical literature, including papers published by Walker, Morava,\nBernier. 229 He explained that such standards were established to provide a common\nlanguage in the field and to prevent misdiagnosis because “people were calling\n[everything] mitochondrial disease.”230 He stated that the only support for Dr. Kelley’s\ndiagnostic method was his own work, which consisted of a single published paper, and\nthat paper did not stand for the proposition for which he cited it. 231\n\n       Doctor Cedarbaum also noted that vitamin cocktails are widely viewed as\nineffective, and that treatment with such could not be fairly cited to as having improved\n\n221\n   See, e.g., Tr. at 159-60 (discussing the common practice of using ratios to evaluate the levels of\ncertain amino acids).\n222\n   Tr. at 159 (stating that his method of analysis was “an elaboration on what many people do”—only\ntaken “a couple steps further”).\n223\n    See, e.g., Tr. at 451 (Doctor Cederbaum stating that alanine was “absolutely not” a substitute marker\nfor pyruvate, and “nobody would suggest that it’s a substitute”).\n224\n      Tr. at 510.\n225\n      Tr. at 510-15\n226\n      Tr. at 515.\n227\n      Res. Ex. A at 6.\n228\n      Tr. at 388.\n229\n      Tr. at 385-86.\n230\n      Tr. at 386.\n231\n      Res. Ex. A at 6 (citing Weissman, Pet. Ex. 28).\n\n\n                                                        108\n\fA.A.’s condition. 232 According to Dr. Cederbaum, few in the metabolic world “would\neven consider a mitochondrial disorder in this setting.” 233 Because there are no real\nside effects from the mitochondrial vitamin cocktail (which contain many ingredients\navailable over the counter), the fact that Drs. Kelley and Zimmerman prescribed such\ntreatment carries less weight than the decision to prescribe a drug with known side\neffects in the face of less than certain diagnosis.\n\n      I do not find Dr. Kelley’s approach to be a reliable method for diagnosing\nmitochondrial disease, disorders, or dysfunction. He has not submitted his ideas to a\nknowledgeable community of peers for judgement; his method has not been widely\nadopted or recognized as a valid diagnostic approach; and he provided only anecdotal\nevidence of reproducibility. I reject Dr. Kelley’s “bald assurance[s] of validity” and\npromises that his findings are based on sound science. 234\n\n       Although his approach might prove correct at some future date, it is not “scientific\nknowledge” just because he says so. 235 He must do the hard work of subjecting it to\npeer-review and publication and thereby earn the recognition and wide-acceptance he\nso clearly believes his method deserves. As it stands, his methods and theories cannot\nbe replicated or confirmed.\n\nD. Autism Diagnosis.\n\n       I find that A.A. has ASD. That diagnosis is consistent with her entire clinical\ncourse, from the pre-vaccination behaviors involving delayed language development,\nstereotypies, and some lack of social involvement, to the tantrums and disinterest in\nopening Christmas toys she demonstrated in the December videos, to the diminished\ninterest in play and talking her mother reported in March 2001 at her well-child visit. By\nthe time she saw a speech therapist in August 2001, she displayed enough behavioral\ndifferences that the therapist thought she had ASD. The diagnosis was essentially\nconfirmed by Dr. Lavenstein in September 2001. The diagnosis persisted. At the time\nof the hearing, A.A. was highly functioning, but still displayed issues with social\ninteraction and boundaries.\n\n                         VIII. Analysis Under Althen, Pafford and Loving.\n\n       The factual underpinnings for petitioners’ claims are absent, based on the\nfindings above. I have found that A.A. did not have a mitochondrial disease,\ndysfunction, or disorder; that she displayed subtle early symptoms of ASD prior to the\nadministration of her October 23, 2000 MMR vaccine; that she did not experience either\n232\n      Res.

The existence\nof any true regression is unlikely, as Dr. Wiznitzer indicated the term is defined.\n\nA. Althen Prong 1: A Reliable Theory.\n\n        Althen requires that a petitioner in an off-Table causation case present a reliable\nmedical theory by explaining how the vaccines administered can cause the injury in\nquestion. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278. This first prong of Althen’s three part causation test\nhas also been characterized as the equivalent of the “Can it cause?” inquiry used in\ntoxic tort litigation. See Pafford, 2004 WL 1717359, at *4.\n\n        The medical theory must be a reputable one, although it need only be “legally\nprobable, not medically or scientifically certain.” Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49. The\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Daubert likewise requires that courts determine expert\nopinions to be reliable before they may be considered as evidence. “In short, the\nrequirement that an expert’s testimony pertain to ‘scientific knowledge’ establishes a\nstandard of evidentiary reliability.” 509 U.S. at 590 (footnote omitted). The Federal\nCircuit has stated that a “special master is entitled to require some indicia of reliability to\nsupport the assertion of the expert witness.” Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1324.\n\n       1. Petitioners’ Theory\n\n        Petitioners claim that A.A.—“born with a susceptibility to mitochondrial\nmetabolism dysfunction, regressed and suffered mitochondrial autism” as the result of\nher MMR vaccine received on October 23, 2000. See Petitioners’ Post-Hearing Brief,\nfiled Nov. 27, 2013, at 1. Alternatively, “petitioners allege, the MMR vaccine\nsignificantly aggravated [a]n underlying condition, mitochondrial metabolism\ndysfunction, resulting in mitochondrial autism.” Id.\n\n        The theory that a child with an underlying mitochondrial disorder can experience\na febrile illness and thereafter decompensate is not seriously disputed in this claim.\nHowever, petitioners’ experts significantly expand upon that theory to postulate what\namounts to an untested hypothesis. Petitioner’s theory has two distinct components: (1)\nthat children with certain specific biochemical findings have a mitochondrial disorder;\nand (2) that these children can experience a vaccine-caused or aggravated regression\nand subsequently develop a condition that looks like autism—the “mitochondrial autism”\ndiagnosed by Dr. Kelley. Petitioners have failed to offer preponderant evidence of\neither component.\n\n             a. Specific biochemical findings are not reliable evidence of a\nmitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction in children.\n\n       Doctor Kelley found that A.A. had a mitochondrial disorder based upon certain\nbiochemical findings. However, I have found that the preponderant evidence does not\nestablish that A.A. had a mitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. The Supreme\nCourt in Daubert indicated that scientific knowledge “connotes more than subjective\n\n\n                                              110\n\fbelief or unsupported speculation.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 590. “[T]estimony must be\nsupported by appropriate validation – i.e., ‘good grounds,’ based on what is known.” Id.\nThe Supreme Court has provided a non-exhaustive list of factors federal courts may\nconsider, including whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the\nscientific community; whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication;\nwhether it can be and has been tested; and whether the known potential rate of error is\nacceptable. Daubert, 43 F.3d at 1316, on remand from, 509 U.S. 579 (1993) (citing\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 592-94).\n\n       This diagnosis was based upon biochemical findings that were not interpreted\nusing established criteria, but an unpublished method that has not been peer-reviewed,\nadopted by other laboratories, or recognized as a valid diagnostic approach by the\nmitochondrial community at large. It is possible that at some time in the future Dr.\nKelley will be able to support his theory that certain biochemical findings are evidence of\na mitochondrial disorder, but at this time I find insufficient indicia of reliability for this\ntheory for me to credit it. As Dr. Cederbaum has observed, Dr. Kelley has propounded\nthe theory that these biochemical findings always equate to an electron transport chain\ndysfunction for 15 years, but has yet to publish the proof. That proof should come\nbefore a court relies upon it.\n\n       For me, one of the most concerning aspects of the lack of publication and\nexplication to the other experts in the field is that the error rate is unknown. Doctor\nKelley’s testimony did not convince me that he had established adequate controls. For\nexample, it would be useful to know not only how neurotypical individuals fare on this\ntesting, but how children with other neurological problems, and children with ASD not\ninvolving regression fare. I note that in the Theory 2 OAP cases, petitioners relied on a\n2004 study by Dr. Jill James showing altered plasma metabolites in children with ASD\nas compared to age-matched control children. Because 19 of the 20 children with ASD\nhad regression, the authors (and the petitioners) concluded that the altered metabolites\ncontributed to their regression. However, there was no basis to imply that the children\nwith regression were metabolically different from those without regression, as only one\nchild without regression was tested. More fundamentally, the authors noted that\nchildren with Down syndrome (an entirely genetic condition) had metabolic profiles more\nsimilar to the ASD children to than the neurotypical controls. See Dwyer, 2010 WL\n892250, at *134 (subpart c, discussing the James studies). I am not considering this\nstudy as substantive evidence in this case; I reference it to demonstrate concerns about\nrelying on unpublished data as evidence.\n\n             b. No preponderant evidence that the MMR vaccination can cause\nregression and “mitochondrial autism” in children with mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n       Assuming that I accepted Dr. Kelley’s theory that specific biochemical findings\nare evidence of mitochondrial a disease, disorder, or dysfunction in children—which I do\nnot—petitioners have still failed to present preponderant evidence that that the MMR\nvaccination can cause regression and “mitochondrial autism” in children with a\nmitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. The evidence on this component of\n\n\n                                             111\n\fpetitioners’ theory is too scant to be reliable. Doctor Kelley asserted that in children\nwith mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation caused by a stressor—such as an\ninfection, a virus, or a vaccine—can cause neurological damage. Tr. at 216-17. Doctor\nKelley stated that in his clinical experience, “if there is an identifiable event or\nidentifiable time frame in which regression occurs, the factor that links it is\ninflammation.” Tr. at 217. He opined that cytokines are involved in the inflammatory\nresponse—particularly, TNF-α, a cytokine that induces apoptosis, or cell death. Tr. at\n216-22. Doctor Kelley asserted “that the peak level of TNF-alpha following\nimmunization with the measles component of the MMR is between 10 and 15 days.”\nPet. Ex. 23 at 3 (citing Poland, Pet. Ex. 71).\n\n       However, Dr. Wiznitzer cogently explained that in Poland, Pet. Ex. 71, for the first\n15 days following vaccination—the critical time period according to Dr. Kelley—none of\nthe values for IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-α secretion rose above their baseline. Tr. at 508.\nDoctor Wiznitzer elaborated “the [Poland] paper itself state[d] that there was no\nappreciable change in the cytokine levels” for the toddler group. Tr. at 510. There is\nsimply no credible evidence that inflammation caused by vaccination plays a role in the\ndevelopment of regression and/or mitochondrial autism in children with mitochondrial\ndysfunction. Doctor Zimmerman in fact conceded that “I don’t think we can say at this\npoint that in any one individual that inflammation is the cause of autism.” Tr. at 320-21.\n\n       While it is uncontested that illnesses and other stressors can cause\ndecompensation or regression in children with inborn errors of metabolism, that\nphenomenon has been observed most frequently in children with urea cycle disorders\n— a condition that A.A. most assuredly does not have. Whether vaccination can do so,\neven in these most vulnerable children, has not been established, and the available\nevidence, most particularly the Morgan study, Res. Ex. C, failed to find evidence that\nthey could.\n\n       The most glaring problem, however, is that no evidence adduced in this case,\nother than the anecdotally based opinions of Dr. Zimmerman, demonstrates that the\ndecompensation or regression induced by illness in children with metabolic or\nmitochondrial disorders looks like, mimics, or actually results in ASD. Children with\nASD may have co-morbid diagnoses of intellectual disability, mitochondrial disorders,\nseizure disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, attention deficit disorders, and many\nothers, but the presence of these other conditions does not automatically equate to a\ncausal relationship.\n\n              c. Conclusion\n\n        I find that petitioners have failed to present preponderant evidence of a reliable\nmedical theory by explaining how the MMR vaccine can cause or significantly aggravate\nthe injury in question. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278; W.C. v. HHS, 704 F.3d 1352, 1357\n(Fed. Cir. 2013) (discussing significant aggravation.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           112\n\fB. Althen Prong 2: A Logical Connection.\n\n       Even if petitioners had provided a theory which satisfied the first prong, to satisfy\nthe second prong of the Althen test, petitioners must establish a “logical sequence of\ncause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury.” Althen,\n418 F.3d at 1278. In other words, petitioners must show that the received vaccine did,\nmore likely than not, cause the injury in the case at bar. Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1356. The\nsequence of cause and effect need only be “‘logical’ and legally probable, not medically\nor scientifically certain.” Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49; accord Capizzano, 440 F.3d at\n1326. Evidence from a treating physician may assist petitioner in meeting her burden of\nproof under the second Althen prong. Capizzano, 440 F.3d at 1326.\n\n        Petitioners have failed to show a logical connection between A.A.’s vaccination\nand her injury, or the significant aggravation of her injury. Based on the totality of the\nevidence, as discussed above, I have found that A.A. was not developing normally prior\nto her vaccination as evidenced by her delayed speech, and abnormal behavior,\nincluding hand flapping and limited eye contact on display in the October 14, 2000\nvideo. See Section VII. 2, supra. After A.A’s vaccination, it is unlikely that she\nexperienced the acute febrile illness that petitioners claim. There is no reliable evidence\nof the type of rapid regression that might signal to a neurologist that something\nsignificant had happened. As Dr. Wiznitzer, a specialist who has diagnosed hundreds\nof children with ASD testified, a precipitous regression would cause him to look for\nsomething other than ASD as a cause. However, the evidence in this case supports the\nslower onset of social and language concerns. In particular, I rely on A.A.’s mother’s\nreport at her March 2001 well-child visit, wherein she described problems developing\nover a period of months, to demonstrate that there was no precipitous or rapid\nregression. See Section VII. 3 and 4, supra. Rather, as discussed, I accept the\ntestimony of Dr. Wiznitzer that the behavior exhibited by A.A. on the portions of the\nOctober 14 and October 29 videos taken in similar circumstances is strikingly similar;\nthat A.A. exhibited signs and symptoms of autism prior to her vaccination; and that, after\nher vaccination, A.A. followed the typical course seen in ASD. See Section VII. 4,\nsupra.\n\n        Accordingly, I find that petitioners have failed to establish a logical sequence of\ncause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury” or the\nsignificant aggravation of a preexisting injury. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278; W.C., 704 F.3d\nat 1357.\n\nC. Althen Prong 3: A Proximate Temporal Connection.\n\n        Merely showing a proximate temporal connection between a vaccination and an\ninjury is insufficient, standing alone, to establish causation. Grant v. Sec’y, HHS, 956\nF.2d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1992). A proximate temporal relationship, even when\ncoupled with the absence of any other identified cause for the injury, is not enough to\ndemonstrate probable cause under the Vaccine Act’s preponderance standard.\nMoberly, 592 F.3d at 1323 (citing Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278).\n\n\n                                            113\n\f         Petitioners have failed to establish a proximate temporal relationship between\nA.A.’s October 23, 2000 MMR vaccination and the onset of her injury, or the significant\naggravation of any preexisting injury. Doctor Kelley opined that the “most important\nfact linking [A.A.’s] deterioration to her MMR vaccination is that the peak level of TNF-\nalpha following immunization with the measles component of the MMR is between 10\nand 15 days.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3 (citing Poland, Pet. Ex. 71). Doctor Kelley testified that\n“the few children that I’ve seen who have regressed with – based on evidence that\nthey’ve regressed with the MMR, it was at 10 to 14 days after the immunization, which .\n. . [coincides with] the peak cytokine response.” Tr. at 225; see also Tr. at 279-81\n(redirect).\n\n          However, as discussed in my Althen prong one analysis, Dr. Wiznitzer cogently\nexplained that in Poland, Pet. Ex. 71, for the first 15 days following vaccination—the\ncritical time period according to Dr. Kelley—none of the values for IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-\nalpha secretion rose above their baseline.” Tr. at 508. Doctor Wiznitzer elaborated that\n“the [Poland] paper itself state[d] that there was no appreciable change in the cytokine\nlevels” for the toddler group, and thus Dr. Kelley’s reliance on this article is erroneous.\nTr. at 510.\n\n       Further, even if petitioners’ had established that a medically appropriate time\nperiod for the onset of A.A.’s injury was between 10 and 15 days subsequent to her\nvaccination, I have found no evidence that A.A. experienced an acute illness on October\n29, 2000, marked by a spiking fever, continuing for four days, and precipitating a\ndevelopmental regression. See Section VII. 3 and 4, supra.\n\n        Accordingly, I find that petitioners have failed to demonstrate a medically\nacceptable proximate temporal relationship between A.A.’s vaccination and injury or the\nsignificant aggravation of any preexisting injury.\n\nD. The Additional Loving Factors\n\n       As disused above, I found that petitioners have failed to establish that A.A.\nsuffered a mitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. Therefore, petitioners cannot\nhave established that A.A.’s October 23, 2000 MMR vaccination significantly\naggravated a mitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction.\n\n       However, I will briefly address the additional Loving factors necessary to proving\nsuch a claim. 236 To demonstrate aggravation of a pre-existing condition, petitioners\nmust show: (1) the vacinee’s condition prior to the administration of the vaccine, (2) the\nvacinee’s current condition, and (3) whether the vacinee’s current condition constitutes\na “significant aggravation” of the condition prior to the vaccination. See Loving v. HHS,\n\n\n\n236\n   The Loving test is a six part test. However, the final three parts are virtually identical to the Althen\nfactors and are addressed above within my Althen analysis.\n\n                                                      114\n\f86 Fed. Cl. 135, 144 (Fed. Cl. 2009) (combining the first three Whitecotton 237 factors for\nclaims regarding aggravation of a Table injury with the three Althen factors for off table\ninjury claims to create a six-part test for off Table aggravation claims); see also W.C.,\n704 F.3d at 1357 (applying the six-part Loving test.).\n\n       In this case I have determined that A.A. was not developing normally prior to her\nvaccination, as she exhibited signs and symptoms of autism; that A.A. experienced no\ndramatic regression or acute event following her October 23, 2000 MMR vaccination,\nand that after her vaccination A.A.’s development followed a course typical of autism.\nSee Section VII., supra. Accordingly, I find that petitioners have not established that\nA.A.’s current condition or her condition after vaccination constitutes a “significant\naggravation” of her condition prior to her vaccination. Petitioners have satisfied neither\nthe Althen test for vaccine causation, nor the Loving test for significant aggravation of a\npre-existing injury.\n\n                                            IX. Conclusion.\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, I find that petitioners have not met their burden\nunder Althen. They did not demonstrate any of the Althen factors by preponderant\nevidence. As the United States Claims Court has noted, an expert’s “conclusions . . .\nare only as good as the reasons and evidence that support them.” Davis v. Sec'y, HHS,\n20 Cl. Ct. 168, 173 (1990); see also Perreira v Sec’y, HHS, 33 F.3d 1375, 1377 n.6\n(Fed. Cir. 1994) (“An expert opinion is no better than the soundness of the reasons\nsupporting it.”) (citations omitted); Dobrydnev v. Sec’y, HHS, 566 Fed.Appx. 976, 982-\n83 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (an expert’s opinion is only worth as much as the facts upon which it\nis based) (citing Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S.\n209, 242 (1993)); Fehrs v. United States, 620 F.2d 255, 265 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (an expert’s\nopinions “can be no better than the soundness of the reasons that stand in support of\nthem”).\n\n        Petitioners have failed to produce preponderant evidence that the MMR\nvaccination A.A. received on October 23, 2000, can or did cause her to develop ASD,\nmitochondrial ASD, or that it can or did aggravate an underlying mitochondrial problem,\nresulting in ASD or mitochondrial ASD.\n\n       Accordingly, the petition for compensation is DENIED.

An amended petition, which now constitutes the operative\npetition for this claim, was filed on March 1, 2012. 3 On May 9, 2012, petitioner moved\n\n1\n  The E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2913 (Dec. 17, 2002) requires\nthat this decision be publically available. In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), petitioner has 14 days\nto identify and move to redact medical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an\nunwarranted invasion of privacy. If, upon review, I agree that the identified material fits within this\ndefinition, I will redact such material from public access.\n2\n The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program [“Vaccine Program”] is set forth in Part 2 of the\nNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755, codified as amended,\n42 U.S.C. § 300aa-10 et seq. (2012). All citations in this decision to individual sections of the Vaccine Act\nare to 42 U.S.C. § 300aa.\n3\n Hereinafter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, any reference to “petition” is to this Amended\nPetition.\n\fto amend the case caption to reflect her name change following remarriage, and to add\nJames Allen, A.A.’s father, as a petitioner.\n\n       In summary, petitioners claim that the measles, mumps, and rubella [“MMR”]\nvaccine A.A. received on October 23, 2000, caused her to suffer from “mitochondrial\npervasive developmental disorder” 4—a “particular form of autistic spectrum disorder\ncaused by an inborn error of mitochondrial metabolism.” Petition ¶¶ Introduction, 15.\nAccording to their experts, A.A. had an underlying mitochondrial disorder—present\nsince birth—that made her vulnerable to the inflammatory effects of the MMR vaccine.\nThe vaccine, which constituted an immunological stressor, overwhelmed A.A.’s already\nimpaired mitochondrial function and caused extensive cell death in her brain. As a\nresult of this damage, she experienced an acute regression and ultimately developed\nmitochondrial autism. See Petitioners’ Post-Hearing Brief, filed Nov. 27, 2013, at 30-60.\n\n      For the reasons set forth below, I find that the record does not contain\npreponderant evidence establishing entitlement to compensation.\n\n                                      I. Procedural History.\n\nA. The Omnibus Autism Program [“OAP”].\n\n       Beginning in 1997, but peaking numerically in 2002-03, thousands of petitions\nwere filed alleging either that the measles, mumps, and rubella [“MMR”] vaccine or\nthimerosal, an ethyl mercury preservative used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, caused\nASD. The sheer volume of petitions filed—more than 1,300 new petitions in 2002\nalone—led to the creation of the OAP. 5 Omnibus programs had been used previously\nto make causation determinations in groups of cases alleging that a particular vaccine\ncaused a specific injury, but the OAP was, by far, the largest such grouping of similar\ncases. 6 By filing their original short-form petition, an abbreviated petition authorized by\nAutism General Order #1, petitioners opted into the OAP.\n\n        Following a series of meetings with an informal advisory committee comprised of\npetitioners’ counsel representing many of the Program claimants plus legal and medical\nrepresentatives of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Office of Special\nMasters adopted a plan that would allow a period of discovery, followed by the selection\nand litigation of test cases on the theories of causation presented. Autism General\n\n4\n Synonymous with “mitochondrial pervasive development disorder” are the terms “autism secondary to\nmitochondrial disease” and “mitochondrial autism.” Tr. at 236-37.\n5\n  See Autism General Order #1, issued July 3, 2002 (found at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31696785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2002 U.S. Claims\nLEXIS 365, or http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/Autism+General+Order1.pdf) (last\nvisited on Sept. 8, 2015).\n6\n See Hennessey v.

The conclusions reached on general causation in the test cases would\nbe used to resolve the remaining individual claims. Id. at 3. Petitioners were allowed to\n“opt in” or “opt out” of the proceedings and future claimants could automatically “opt in”\nby filing the short form petition included as Attachment B to Autism General Order #1.\nAutism General Order #1 at 6-8.\n\n        Attorneys representing petitioners created the Petitioners’ Steering Committee\n[“PSC”] to coordinate the OAP litigative effort. The PSC acknowledged that there was\ninsufficient evidence at the time the OAP was created to prove vaccine causation, but\naverred that such evidence could be found through discovery and ongoing scientific\ninvestigations. Petitioners sought and received an extended period of time to conduct\ndiscovery and prepare to litigate test cases.\n\n       Nearly five years after the OAP was created, litigation in the test cases began.\nThe PSC presented two different theories on the causation of ASD in two sets of test\ncases. The first alleged that thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine, in\ncombination, could cause ASD (Theory 1). The second alleged that thimerosal-\ncontaining vaccines could cause ASD (Theory 2). 7\n\n       Decisions in each of the three Theory 1 test cases, which were tried in 2007,\nrejected petitioners’ causation theories.

The OAP test case litigation concluded in 2010, with the last Federal Circuit\ndecision affirming the dismissal of the final Theory 1 test case. 9\n\n         During the period between the test case hearings and the final appellate action\non the test case decisions, petitioners in this case, like others in the OAP, were ordered\nto file the medical records necessary to establish that the petition was timely filed. See\nOrder, issued Mar. 13, 2009, at 5. Petitioners filed the required medical records on\nJune 11, 2009 and July 22, 2009. See Petitioners’ Exhibits [“Pet. Exs.”] 1-10. On\nAugust 14, 2009, respondent filed a statement indicating that the claim was timely filed\nand involved a diagnosis of ASD. Because the claim was determined to have been\ntimely filed, petitioners were ordered to file all remaining medical records. See Order,\nissued Aug. 24, 2009, at 1-2. Petitioners filed the required medical records on\nNovember 19, 2009 and December 23, 2009. See Pet.

If petitioners wished to continue with their claim,\nthey were ordered to file an amended petition, setting forth their theory of causation. 10\nId.

Exs.”] A-S.\n\n       On January 9, 2013, I held a telephonic status conference pursuant to Vaccine\nRule 5 12 to discuss the expert reports and positions of the parties. During the status\nconference, the parties agreed that the case was ready for a hearing to address the\nexperts’ disagreement with regard to causation. I noted that certain factual disputes still\nexisted and that I would need the experts to testify on these issues as well. I ordered\nthe parties to file a joint status report by January 24, 2013, providing possible hearing\ndates. See Scheduling Order, issued Jan. 9, 2013.\n\n       After the parties filed their joint status report, I scheduled a four-day entitlement\nhearing in Washington, D.C. from July 9-12, 2013. See Pre-Hearing Order, issued Jan.\n28, 2013. On April 5, 2013, I ordered the parties to file any outstanding evidence on\nwhich they intended to rely by May 24, 2013. See Pre-Hearing Order, issued Apr. 5,\n2013, at 1. I also ordered the parties to file (1) a joint submission identifying any\ndisputed and non-disputed issues; (2) a memorandum containing their basic factual\ncontentions and applicable legal authority; (3) an affidavit from each fact witness, if not\npreviously filed; and (4) witness lists. Id. at 2.\n\n        Over the next several months, petitioners timely filed additional medical\nliterature, 13 updated school and medical records, and relevant video evidence.\nRespondent also filed additional medical literature. 14 On June 10, 2013, the parties filed\ntheir pre-hearing submissions. Petitioners indicated that they would be calling four\nwitnesses, including two expert witnesses, to testify at the hearing. See Pet. Pre-\nHearing Submission, filed June 10, 2013, at 34. Respondent indicated that she would\nbe calling both of her expert witnesses to testify. See Res. Pre-Hearing Submission,\nfiled June 10, 2013 (ECF No. 80), at 16. Petitioners also filed the affidavits of James\nAllen (A.A.’s father) and Susan Edick (A.A.’s aunt), A.A.’s vaccination record, and\nadditional video and photographic evidence.\n\n11\n  The supporting documents from Dr. Kelley included A.A.’s amino acid profile (Pet.

See Joint Pre-Hearing Submission, filed June 10, 2013 (ECF No. 79).\nSpecifically, the parties disputed (1) “the state of A.A.’s health and development prior to\nOctober 23, 2000”; (2) whether “A.A. suffer[ed] a developmental regression after her\nreceipt of the October 23, 2000, MMR vaccination[,]” and, if so, when the regression\noccurred; (3) whether the “October 23, 2000, MMR vaccinations cause[d]-in-fact any of\nA.A.’s subsequently diagnosed developmental, neurological, or mitochondrial issues”;\nand (4) whether “A.A. has a mitochondrial disease[.]” Id. at 1-2.\n\n        On June 20, 2013, petitioners filed additional video evidence. See Pet. Ex. 80.\nOn June 28, 2013, I held a telephonic status conference with the parties to discuss the\npending hearing. I also discussed the video evidence filed by petitioners. Petitioners’\ncounsel confirmed that the video was a compilation of clips taken from a more complete\nrecording. I explained that although the edited clips could be used during testimony, the\nentire recording should be filed into the record for review. I also requested that any\nadditional videos of A.A. from the first two years of her life be filed, if available. See\nScheduling Order, issued July 1, 2013.\n\n       In compliance with my order, petitioners filed an unedited version of the video.\nSee Pet. Ex. 81. Petitioners also filed a status report stating that “after a diligent\nsearch, . . . they were unable to locate any additional videos of A.A. from one to two\nyears of age.” See Status Report, filed July 2, 2013, at 2.\n\n       The entitlement hearing was held as scheduled, from July 9-12, 2013. Four\nphysicians testified at the four day hearing. Mr. Allen and Ms. Edick also testified in\nperson. A.A. also attended part of the hearing, and I had the opportunity to meet and\nspeak with her. Following the hearing, I set a schedule for the identification and\ncorrection of transcript errors and the submission of post-hearing briefs. See Post-\nHearing Order, issued on July 30, 2013.\n\n       On August 1, 2013, petitioners filed several exhibits used during the hearing.\nSee Trial Exhibits [“Trial Exs.”] 1-5. On September 3, 2013, I filed Court Exhibit I, a\nmedical journal article, and provided the parties and their experts an opportunity to\ncomment on the exhibit. See Res. Resp. to Court’s Sept. 3, 2013 Order and Ex., filed\nSept. 30, 2013; Res. Ex. DD; Pet. Resp. to Court’s Sept. 3, 2013 Order and Ex., filed\nOct. 3, 2013; Pet. Ex. 82.\n\n       On September 6, 2013, the parties submitted their joint corrections to the\ntranscript. A corrected version of the transcript was filed on September 19, 2013. 15\n\n      Simultaneous post-hearing briefs were filed on November 27, 2013. On\nDecember 12, 2013, the parties submitted responses to the post-hearing briefs,\ncompleting the record.\n\n\n15\n     All references to the transcript are to the corrected version.\n\n\n                                                         6\n\f              II. Legal Standards Applying to Off-Table Causation Claims.\n\n        When petitioners allege an off-Table injury, eligibility for compensation is\nestablished when, by a preponderance of the evidence, petitioners demonstrate that the\nvaccinee received, in the United States, a vaccine appearing on the Table and\nsustained an illness, disability, injury, or condition caused by the vaccine or experienced\na significant aggravation of a preexisting condition. They must also demonstrate that\nthe condition has persisted for more than six months. 16 Vaccine Act litigation rarely\nconcerns whether the vaccine appears on the Table, the geographical location of\nadministration, or whether the symptoms have persisted for the requisite time. Rather,\nin the very small minority of Vaccine Act cases that proceed to a hearing, the most\ncommon issue to be resolved by the special master is whether the injury alleged was\ncaused by the vaccine.\n\n        To establish legal causation in an off-Table case, Vaccine Act petitioners must\nestablish by preponderant evidence: (1) a reliable medical theory causally connecting\nthe vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that\nthe vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a proximate temporal relationship\nbetween vaccination and injury.

Summary of Relevant Medical Records.\n\nA. Early Medical and Developmental History.\n\n      A.A., petitioners’ first child, was born in mid-July, 1999. She was a healthy\nnewborn, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. 19 Pet. Ex. 1, p. 19. Her newborn exam was\nnormal. 20 Pet. Ex. 3, pp. 5, 16.\n\n      During her first year of life, A.A. received routine childhood immunizations 21 and\nwas generally healthy with no major illnesses. Her medical records from Countryside\nPediatrics [“Countryside”], her primary care provider, 22 reflect scheduled well child\nexaminations, as well as periodic unscheduled visits due to minor illnesses.\n\n       A.A. was seen for her two-month well child visit on September 17, 1999, and was\nnoted to be “doing very well.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 13. The medical report indicated a normal\nphysical examination, and normal development as measured by six defined skills,\nincluding whether she regarded a face directly and responded to sound. 23\n19\n   The Apgar score is a numerical assessment of a newborn’s condition (with lower numbers indicating\nproblems), usually taken at one minute and five minutes after birth. The score is derived from the infant’s\nheart rate, respiration, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color, with from zero to two points awarded in\neach of the five categories. See DORLAND’S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY (32d ed. 2012)\n[“DORLAND’S”] at 1682; NELSON TEXTBOOK OF PEDIATRICS (19th ed. 2011) [“NELSON’S ”] at 536-37.\n20\n  She initially failed the audiological evaluation; however, upon re-testing, her hearing was found to be\nwithin normal limits. Pet. Ex. 3, pp. 13-15.\n21\n   On September 17, 1999, A.A received her first vaccinations, which included the combined diphtheria,\ntetanus, and acellular pertussis [“DTaP”]; Haemophilus influenzae Type b [“Hib”]; and the inactivated polio\n[“IPV”] vaccines. Pet. Ex. 9, p.1. She received the second round of the same vaccines at her two month\nwell child visit on November 19, 1999. Id. She received her third DTaP and Hib vaccines at her six\nmonth well child visit on January 21, 2000. Id. She received the varicella and her first hepatitis B\nvaccines at her one year well child visit on July 26, 2000. Id.\n22\n  A.A. was evaluated by a variety of health care professionals at Countryside Pediatrics, including\nmedical doctors, certified pediatric nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. These professionals will all\nbe referred to as her “pediatrician,” regardless of their credentials.\n23\n   A.A.’s pediatrician made use of developmental checklists with very specific developmental milestones\nfor specific ages. Those for the two month visit incuded: (1) Regards face directly; (2) Lifts head when\nupright; (3) Coos; (4) Smiles; (5) Grasps object when placed in hands; (6) Responds to sound. Pet. Ex.\n9, p. 13.\n\n\n                                                     10\n\f        On November 11, 1999, at about four months of age, she was seen for an upper\nrespiratory infection [“URI”]. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 62. She had awakened screaming, with\nfever, irritability, and loss of appetite. Id. Her pediatrician gave instructions to call if her\nfever exceeded 100 degrees or if she did not improve within three days. Id. On\nNovember 16, 1999, she was seen due to congestion, irritability, and difficulty sleeping,\nand was diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Id., p. 61. She returned again on November 19,\n1999, with URI symptoms and continued congestion. Id., p. 60.\n\n       At her six-month well child visit on January 21, 2000, A.A.’s growth and\ndevelopment were normal. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 12. The medical report indicated a normal\nphysical examination, and normal development as measured by eight defined skills,\nincluding whether she laughed and babbled or could sit with little support. 24 Id. On\nJanuary 26, 2000, she returned due to a persistent cough and runny nose, which was\ndiagnosed as a URI. Id., p. 59. She had been pulling at her ears, as well. Id.\n\n        A.A. was seen for her nine-month well child visit on April 21, 2000. Pet. Ex. 9, p.\n11. The medical report contained no written comments, but indicated a normal physical\nexamination, and normal development as measured by seven defined skills, including\nthe ability to imitate “mama, dada.” 25 Id. On April 26, 2000, A.A. returned due to\ncongestion and a raspy voice. Id., p. 58. After examination, she was diagnosed with\nright otitis media [“OM”], bilateral conjunctivitis, and a URI. Id.\n\n       On July 24, 2000, A.A. attended her one-year well child examination,\naccompanied by her nanny. She was assessed as normal with regard to illness and\naccidents, and her temperament, as reported by the nanny, was “no problem.” The\ncorresponding medical report indicated a normal physical examination, and normal\ndevelopment as measured by eight defined skills, including whether she could walk two\nto three steps or say one to three words. 26 Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10.\n\nB. Administration of Allegedly Causal Vaccination.\n\n       As reflected by the medical evidence of record, A.A. did not visit any healthcare\nprovider between her one-year well child visit and her 15-month checkup. At that\nexamination, on October 23, 2000, she was tugging at her ears and was reported to\noften have a cold. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 9. Her physical examination was normal, although her\ntympanic membranes had fluid. Id. She also had normal development as measured by\n\n24\n  The eight assessed developmental skills were: (1) Reaches for toys; (2) No head lag; (3) Laughs,\nbabbles; (4) Peak-a-boo, pat-a-cake; (5) Sits with little support; (6) Fearful of strangers; (7) Rolls over; (8)\nBears own weight. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 12.\n25\n  The seven assessed developmental skills were: (1) Pincer grasp; (2) Holds bottle; (3) Imitates mama,\ndada; (4) Peak-a-boo, pat-a-cake: (5) Sits well alone; (6) Crawls; (7) Pulls up to stand. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 11.\n26\n  The eight assessed developmental skills were: (1) Precise pincer grasp; (2) Stands alone; (3) Walks 2-\n3 steps; (4) Says 1-3 words; (5) Imitates sounds; (6) Eats and drinks sitting up; (7) Points; (8) Waves\n“bye-bye.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10.\n\n\n                                                       11\n\ffive defined skills, including whether she could walk well alone and point at one to two\nbody parts. 27 Id. At this examination she received her first MMR, second hepatitis B,\nand fourth Hib vaccines. Id., p.1. Petitioners claim this MMR vaccine was causal of\nA.A.’s current condition.\n\nC. Growth and Development Following the October 23, 2000 Vaccination.\n\n        The first reported illness following her 15-month check-up and MMR vaccination\nwas nearly two months later, on December 18, 2000, when she was treated for a viral\ninfection and early OM. Pet. Ex. 9, p.57. The examination report from that encounter\nreflected that A.A. had vomited the previous night, and awakened with a fever; however,\nthere is no mention of any behavioral or developmental concerns. Id. On January 25,\n2001, she was treated at the Loudon Healthcare Emergency Room for second degree\nburns to her hands after she touched a hot fireplace screen at home. Pet. Ex. 22, pp.\n18-20.\n\n       A.A. was seen for her 18-month 28 well child visit on March 1, 2001. Additionally,\nshe had a runny nose and was teething. The examination report noted that the burns to\nher hands were healing well. Some issues with the previous nanny were reported, but\nA.A. was “opening up more” now with a new nanny. Her physical examination was\ncompletely normal, except for a left ear infection. She was prescribed an antibiotic, with\norders to follow up in 10 to 14 days. She was behind on two vaccinations (DTaP and\nIPV), which could be administered at the follow-up visit. Her development was again\nmeasured against a defined set of skills; for the first time, A.A. did not display some of\nthe expected skills. The report indicated that she was fully able to drink from a cup,\nwalk up steps, point to body parts, and scribble. However, she had not mastered using\na spoon and only took off some clothes. Her ability to build three to four block towers\nwas not checked as achieved. And, the response to whether she could speak 4-10\nwords was “? consistency.” Despite diagnosed acute left OM, she was evaluated as a\n“well 19 month old.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 8.\n\n         A note dated March 1, 2001 continued the report from A.A.’s 18 month well child\nvisit. It stated:\n\n          Mom reports [decreased] language skills.

Pet. Ex. 9, p. 9. Language or vocabulary\nwas not assessed on the examination record, but the Denver II developmental screening form reflected\nthat she had at least three words at 15 months of age. Id., p. 7\n28\n     A.A. was more than 19 months old at the time of the visit.\n\n\n                                                       12\n\f        if this becomes a power struggle [with baby].

Ex. 9, p. 18.\n\n      The examiner also completed the medical portion of the Virginia School Entrance\nHealth Form, which was required prior to A.A.’s admission to school. The report\ngenerally mirrored the findings noted in the Countryside Pediatrics record described\nabove and estimated her developmental level to be within normal limits. Pet. Ex. 7, p.\n13.\n\n        A.A. next visited Countryside on March 23, 2001, due to coughing and\ncongestion. Also of concern was a reported increase in hearing loss after the “past 3\n[bilateral] OM” and her ear tugging. She was diagnosed with a URI and bilateral OM. A\nnote indicated that A.A.’s “language skills [were] improving” and that she could say “uh-\noh” and “bye, bye.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 56.\n\n       Several weeks later, on April 2, 2001, A.A. was treated for OM. She had\ncontinued tugging at her ears, was “generally feeling miserable,” and had been\n“sleeping a lot.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 55. She also received her third hepatitis B and IPV and\nher fourth DTaP vaccines at this examination. Id., p. 1.\n\n        On May 7, 2001, A.A. returned to follow up on her three ear infections,\naccompanied by her nanny. The examination report noted concerns regarding A.A.’s\nhearing, speech/language delay, and vocabulary of about six words. She was\ndiagnosed again with OM. For the first time, her pediatrician assessed her as\ndevelopmentally delayed in speech. Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 19, 54; see also id., p. 7 (Denver\nII). 29\n\n       A.A. was next seen on June 13, 2001, for a possible urinary tract infection\n[“URI”]. Her mother thought she was having problems urinating. She was noted as\ncrying, but consolable at the appointment. Mrs. Allen was to call if the concerns\npersisted. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 53.\n\nD. Diagnosis of and Evaluations for Speech Delay.\n\n      A.A.’s two-year well child visit took place on August 6, 2001. Her physical\nexamination was normal. However, she was again diagnosed as having a\ndevelopmental speech delay. The examination was “very difficult,” because A.A. was\n\n29\n   The Denver Developmental Screening Test [“Denver II”] was a widely used assessment for examining\nthe developmental progress of young children; however, in recent years the test has fallen out of favor\nwith some early childhood organizations. See, e.g., Minnesota Department of Health,\nhttp://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/fh/mch/webcourse/ devscrn/instrument.cfm (last visited Sept. 8, 2015)\n(not recommended as a developmental screening instrument). The test’s publisher closed in 2015; the\ntesting materials are no longer available for sale. See Denver Developmental Materials, Inc.,\nhttp://denverii.com/ (last visited Sept. 8, 2015).\n\n\n                                                   13\n\fapprehensive and screamed throughout the encounter. As a result, the examination\nreport, including the nine-item developmental skills checklist, was not thoroughly\ncompleted. The two skills that were evaluated (“2-3 word sentences” and “repeats\nwords”) were marked as abnormal. 30 She was referred for speech evaluation. Pet. Ex.\n9, p. 4.\n\n       A hearing test on August 27, 2001, was inconclusive, and she was re-evaluated\non August 31, 2001. Although testing was again incomplete because A.A. “was very\nactive and crying,” the obtained results suggested “normal hearing in at least one ear.”\nThe audiologist recommended A.A. undergo a speech and language evaluation. Pet.\nEx. 5, p. 1.\n\n        That speech and language evaluation was conducted on September 5, 2001.\nA.A.’s nanny accompanied her to the appointment and served as the informant\nregarding her daily communication skills and behaviors. Her parents supplied a written\nhistory. The report noted that A.A.’s medical history was significant for ear infections.\nHer developmental milestones were reportedly age-appropriate. Although she was\nclumsy with walking, she was able to run and climb with coordination. Her fine motor\nskills were still developing. Pet. Ex. 5, p. 4. Her speech and language landmarks were\nreported “as age appropriate to a point.” Id., p. 5. She reportedly spoke “her first word\n‘Quack’ at 1 year and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months.” Id.\nHowever,\n\n          [s]he stopped speaking after having 3 ear infections in a row..[31] She has\n          just begun to put 2 words together. She has an estimated expressive\n          vocabulary of 30 words. In the past 6 months she has begun to babble a\n          lot again. She cries, points, and tugs, as her primary means of\n          communicating with her parents and nanny. She does not communicate\n          with peers. [She] reportedly will learn new words, but when she does, . . .\n          previous learning is lost.\n\nId.\n\n       After testing and examination, the speech-language pathologist provided the\nfollowing assessment:\n\n          [A.A.] is an attractive young child who would not engage with this\n          examiner. Based on clinical observations and caregiver’s report, she\n          presents with delayed receptive language skills and gaps in her\n          expressive language development. Of greater significance are her poor\n          pragmatic skills (eye contact, joint attention, etc.) and atypical behaviors:\n30\n  The nine assessed developmental skills were: (1) Uses spoon well; (2) Eats using spoon; (3) Walks up\nsteps; (4) Knows name; (5) Runs without falling; (6) Builds 5-6 blocks; (7) 2-3 word sentences; (8)\nRepeats words; (9) Can do simple tasks. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 4.\n31\n     A.A. was seen for these ear infections on March 1 and 23, and April 2, 2001. Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 8, 54-56.\n\n\n                                                      14\n\f          preference of objects over people, sustained odd play, tantrums,\n          resistance to changes in routine, showing distress for reasons not\n          apparent to others, lack of response to verbal cues (although hearing tests\n          in normal range), aloof manner, fascination with venetian blinds/lights,\n          desire to hold objects daily, and walking on tip toes. These combined\n          behaviors may suggest that she is experiencing more than just a\n          developmental delay.\n\nPet. Ex. 5, p. 11. The speech pathologist “suspect[ed] autism” and recommended that\nA.A. “receive evaluation from a pediatric neurologist and/or developmental psychologist\nto assess communication and behavioral patterns to determine/rule-out underlying\nproblems.” Id.\n\nE. Autism Evaluations.\n\n       On September 16, 2001, A.A. was seen for a neurologic consultation with Dr.\nBennett L. Lavenstein at Children’s National Medical Center [“Children’s Hospital”], in\nWashington, D.C. In the resultant report, Dr. Lavenstein noted that A.A. had been\nreferred by a speech pathologist who perceived “features of autism” in some of her\nbehaviors. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96. He recounted that A.A., by history, had\n\n          [d]emonstrated normal behavior in the neonatal course. Subsequently\n          sat, walked and was appropriate in her milestones . . . . In October of\n          2000 she had some oral sounds but then subsequently regressed. There\n          has been some evidence of echolalia. Occasional stereotype movements\n          have been noted, especially when excited with some hand motions, and\n          she is noted to walk on her tip toes. At this time, she has been evaluated\n          in a hearing evaluation with an audiogram that was noted to be normal.\n          She has no history of seizures. There has been no evidence of\n          regression.\n          ...\n          Additional behavioral features reveal that [A.A.] frequently will stare at\n          lights, stares in the mirror and continues to twirl her hair. She does have\n          some interaction with those in the environment.\n\nId.\n\n       Her neurologic examination was generally within normal limits, but A.A. was non-\ncommunicative. 32 Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96. According to Dr. Lavenstein, A.A. was “a patient in\nwhom there may have been development of primitive speech then a regression of\nspeech, . . . a child who has autistic symptomatology.” Id. He recommended an\nadditional MRI scan and electroencephalogram [“EEG”] testing to determine whether\n\n\n\n32\n     Reflexes were normal, and she was not hypertonic.\n\n\n                                                    15\n\f“there are features that would be suggestive of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome.” Id., pp.\n96-97. 33\n\n       Following the neurologic consultation, A.A. underwent further diagnostic testing,\nincluding a cerebral MRI and an EEG, as well as blood plasma analysis to obtain amino\nacid levels. A radiological report dated October 3, 2001, indicated A.A.’s cerebral MRI\nresults were unremarkable. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 76. Similarly, an October 15, 2001, report\nindicated that her EEG results were within normal limits. Pet. Ex. 9, p.93. With regard\nto her amino acid levels, an October 22, 2001, laboratory report showed “mildly\nelevated” tyrosine and lysine, and “borderline high” branched-chain amino acids. The\nreport stated, however, that clinical correlation was required, and Dr. Lavenstein\nindicated they were reported as “non specific” by Dr. Mendel Tuchman, who interpreted\nthem. Pet. Exs. 10, p. 6; 9, p. 85.\n\n        On October 27, 2001, A.A. presented to Loudon Ear, Nose & Throat Specialists\nfor an evaluation of her recurrent episodes of otitis media. During the consultation,\nA.A.’s mother reported that “[o]ver the last 10 months, [A.A.] ha[d] had 4-5 acute [otitis\nmedia] episodes, . . . and, more importantly, ha[d] been diagnosed with speech delay.”\nPet. Ex. 9, p. 92. According to her mother, A.A.’s “regression began when the ear\ninfections started, and at least some of the developmental delay experts have indicated\nthat the fluid in her ear and/or recurrent acute infections could be at least part of the\nproblem.” Id. The physician examined A.A. and confirmed that she suffered from a\nspeech delay, “since at this age she still has very minimal vocabulary.” Id. She opined\nthat “her history of recurrent acute otitis media could be contributory since even\ntransient conductive hearing losses would affect her speech development at this age.”\nId. The physician recommended bilateral myringotomy and ventilation tube placement.\nId. The procedure was performed around October 2001. 34\n\n       A.A. was seen repeatedly over an approximately six week period, beginning in\nNovember 2001, for minor illnesses, which included pharyngitis and otitis media. See\nPet. Ex. 9, pp. 43, 45, 47, 49, 51. Reports of behavioral issues were mentioned during\nthese visits. Id.\n\n       On the morning of December 17, 2001, A.A. was taken to the Inova Fairfax\nHospital Emergency Department because of severe pain in her abdomen and groin\narea with recurrent bouts of uncontrollable crying and screaming, all of which had begun\napproximately one week earlier. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 10. After an initial examination, the\nemergency department physician rendered a tentative diagnosis of intermittent\nabdominal pain, rule out intussusception and UTI. Id. A barium enema and a kidney,\nureter, and bladder [“KUB”] workup were negative for intussusception, but notable for\n33\n  This evaluation also appears at Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 17-18. Duplicates of other exhibits also appear in\nA.A.’s primary care records. I will not identify duplicate citations.\n34\n  Medical records of the procedure were not filed; however, the surgery appears to have occurred around\nOctober 2001. See Pet. Ex. 9, p. 92 (Oct. 27, 2001 audiology consult recommending procedure “in the\nnear future”); Pet. Ex. 4, p. 28 (Dec. 17, 2001 medical history noting “PE tubes placed ~ 3 mo ago.”).\n\n\n                                                    16\n\fincreased stool in the colon, which “[t]he patient was not able to evacuate.” Id., pp. 40-\n41. The emergency department recommended that A.A. be admitted to the hospital for\nfurther testing and evaluation. Id., p. 34. A.A.’s pediatrician was informed of her status\nand of the available test results, including evidence of thrombocytosis and increased C-\nreactive proteins [“CRP”]. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 41. All other tests were negative, but an upper\ngastrointestinal [“UGI”] was still needed. Id.\n\n        At admission, A.A.’s mother completed a comprehensive pediatric history form\nregarding her health and development. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 56-58. She reported that A.A.\nwas generally healthy, but noted that she had recently been sick, had allergies to eggs\nand dairy, and was “slightly behind” in meeting developmental milestones. Id. She\nspecifically denied that A.A. had any history of gastrointestinal or genitourinary issues,\nor had any ear problems. Id. A.A.’s current medications were listed as Tylenol, smart\noil, good bacteria, and unidentified supplements. Id., p. 56.\n\n       Additional history was provided to the attending physician during the admitting\nexamination: A.A. was reportedly in her usual state of health following a flu-like illness\nwhen she developed increased fatigue, fussiness, and episodes of abdominal and\nperineal pain. Her symptoms were accompanied by extreme tantrums, during which\nshe placed her hands near her perineal/paravaginal area and screamed uncontrollably.\nThe episodes, which started about one week earlier, occurred several times per day\nand lasted for 20-30 minutes. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 28; see also id., p. 18 (pediatric history\ntaken by resident).\n\n        As for her earlier medical history, the attending physician recounted her burn\ninjury in January 2001 and a history of multiple ear infections requiring a myringotomy in\nOctober 2001. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 28; see also id., p. 18. The physician also noted that A.A.\nhad undergone an EEG and MRI in October 2001 with normal results “per Dr.\nLavenstein.” Id., p. 28. Concerning her development, the physician reported that A. A.\nhad a language delay and toe walked, but noted that she “runs [up and down] stairs,\nself feeds, [and] can speak in sentences, but talks little.” Id. Her speech reportedly had\nincreased after her myringotomy. Id. No history of behavioral problems was reported.\nId., p. 18. With regard to her diet, the physician noted that A.A.’s food allergies were\ndiscovered by way of a home ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] test\nadministered by her parents. Id., p. 28. A.A. was currently “followed by a nutritionist”\nand had a diet free of dairy and eggs and supplemented with vitamins. Id.\n\n      A.A. remained in the hospital overnight and was discharged on December 18,\n2001. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 7. A hospital pediatric consultation report dated that day\nsummarized the results of various tests undertaken during A.A.’s hospitalization. The\nconsulting physician stated:\n\n       [A.A.’s] work up so far has included a [KUB x-ray] which is notable for\n       increased stool in the colon as well as a normal barium enema and normal\n       pelvic ultrasound with Doppler. Of note, she does have thrombocytosis\n       with platelets of 947 and mildly elevated CRP of 1.32. Mild anemia with\n\n\n                                            17\n\f          hemoglobin of 11.2[,] but with normal electrolytes, liver function tests and\n          urinalysis. An electroencephalogram being done today . . . is pending. 35\n\nPet. Ex. 4, p. 21.\n\n        The consultant noted that A.A.’s physical examination was normal and stated\nthat “[a]t this point, it is unclear if her colicky pain is clearly gastrointestinal related or\nnot. It is possible that she may be having some post infection enteropathy which is\nworsened with her constipation.” Pet. Ex. 4, p. 21. He recommended an upper GI\nexamination to “rule out malrotation with intermittent volvulus and ischemia,” additional\nblood work, and continued Milk of Magnesia “to clean her out.” Id. The upper GI study\nperformed the following day, December 19, 2001, was negative for any abnormalities,\nincluding malrotation or duodenal obstruction. Id., p. 5.\n\n       On December 20, 2001, A.A was seen at Countryside for repeat blood testing.\nThe medical report noted that A.A. was feeling better. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 39. However, on\nDecember 31, 2001, A.A.’s mother telephoned Countryside seeking an appointment.\nShe reported that A.A. was “hysterical, upset since [2:30 a.m.], throwing things.” She\nstated that A.A. had been “evaluated at Fairfax Hospital [two] weeks [earlier] for these\nsame symptoms, EEG done, upper and lower GI, barium enema done, no cause was\nfound.” Id., p. 37. An appointment was scheduled for later that day. The corresponding\nmedical report noted that A.A.’s mother requested a toxicology workup for metals and\nexpressed concern about her decreased language ability. The possibility of autism was\nraised. Id., p. 36.\n\n       On January 3, 2002, A.A. was evaluated by a gastroenterologist for constipation.\nThe consultation report recounted that A.A. had recently been hospitalized “for extreme\nepisodes of rage/irritability.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 90. It noted that neurological evaluation was\nin progress “for possible developmental disorders.” Id. Abdominal x-rays taken during\nhospitalization “revealed large amount of retained stool” and the upper GI study was\nnormal. Id. The physician conducted a physical examination with normal findings. Id.\nA diagnosis of constipation was made. Id.\n\n       On January 14, 2002, A.A.’s parents telephoned Countryside to discuss her\nstatus. During the call, A.A.’s father stated “that he [was] 100% sure that [A.A.’s]\nproblems [we]re from her MMR immunization. 36 Her behavior started 30 days post\n\n35\n     The EEG results were normal. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 39.\n36\n   On January 28, 2002, Mrs. Allen was interviewed by a Loudon Public Schools social worker who was\npreparing a sociocultural assessment as part of A.A.’s application for special education services. During\nthe interview she reported that A.A.’s “development was fine until 10-23-00 when she had her MMR\nvaccination.” Pet. Ex. 8, p. 47. However, a few days later, on February 1, 2002, Mrs. Allen reported to a\nschool psychologist that A.A. “was very outgoing and her language skills were developing within normal\nlimits” until “[a]bout a year ago,” when her “speech skills began to regress and she began to struggle in\nsocial situations.” Pet. Ex. 8, p. 27. This time frame coincides with her three ear infections, which\noccurred in March and April 2001. See Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 8, 54-56.\n\n\n                                                       18\n\fMMR.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 35. He had been doing his own research on the Internet and had\nordered several dietary supplements, including pills to improve brain function and help\nthe body eliminate harmful metals. 37 Id. He also stated that they had seen a nutritionist\nnamed Kelly Dorfman who gave them “smart oil” to improve A.A.’s intelligence by 15\npercent. Id.\n\n       On January 14-15, 2002, Dr. Lavenstein administered a 24-hour DigiTrace EEG\nto record A.A.’s brain activity. The corresponding report noted that A.A. had “a history\nof seizures. First episode was December 2001 and last episode was [January 13,\n2002]. They seem to occur every day. Patient has a history of speech delay. These\n[seizures] appear to be temper tantrum-like events.” Pet. Ex. 10, p. 1. Doctor\nLavenstein stated that the EEG recorded several of these tantrum events, but “[a]t no\ntime was there any evidence of a[n] electrographic seizure correlate.” Id. The EEG\nrevealed “no premonitory electrographic discharge” or “evidence of any focal\nepileptiform disturbance.” Id. His impression was: “This 24 hour EEG correlating with\nany temper tantrums does not reveal any evidence of paroxysmal abnormality and is\nwithin normal limits.” Id.\n\n        In a letter dated February 2, 2002, Dr. Lavenstein provided his conclusions and\nrecommendations in light of the various tests performed to date. With regard to her\nsleep problems, he advised that A.A. undergo a polysomnogram for further sleep\nanalysis, as she had a sleep disorder. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 85. Concerning her developmental\ndelays and behavioral problems, Dr. Lavenstein raised concern “about the possibility of\nautism,” as there was “past development of primitive speech, then regression of speech\nin the setting of a positive family history of epilepsy in a child who does have autistic\nsymptomatology.” Id. Neurologic testing showed no evidence of Landau-Kleffner\nsyndrome, and an MRI scan was within normal limits. Id. Laboratory studies to date\nwere basically normal, including an amino acid screen. Id. Although there “were some\nborderline levels of tyrosine and lysine[, t]hese were felt to be nonspecific[.]” Id. Dr.\nLavenstein recommended that A.A. begin taking Klonopin to help her sleep. Id. He\nnoted that A.A. was to see Dr. Zimmerman in the near future. Id.\n\nF. Evaluations and Treatment at the Kennedy Krieger Children’s Hospital.\n\n       On February 13, 2002, A.A. was evaluated by Dr. Gerald Raymond at the\nNeurobehavioral Unit of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. Pet. Ex.\n6, p. 25. The initial evaluation report noted that A.A.’s parents were concerned about\nher “loss of language and social skills, and frequent temper tantrums.” 38 Id. According\nto her parents, A.A. “sat up independently at 6-months and walked by 12-months.” Id.\nAt the time of the evaluation, she was able to use a sippy cup, spoon, and a fork, “but\n\n37\n Mr. Allen specifically identified the following websites: www.life-enhancement.com;\nwww.extremehealth.com.\n38\n  Contemporaneous with the initial visit, A.A.’s parents completed a developmental and medical history\nform to provide background information for Dr. Raymond’s evaluation. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 39-44.\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fsometimes [ate] with her hands.” Id. She also assisted with dressing and undressing,\nbut was not toilet-trained. Id. The report continued:\n\n           Loss of language skills was noted at approximately 16-months. Prior to\n           that, she was reportedly able to make ‘animal sounds’ such as ‘roar!’ when\n           asked, and was able to state her age. Parents feel that loss of skills was\n           concomitant [sic] with her 15 month MMR vaccination. She has made\n           some improvements since that time and is now able to count some\n           objects. She occasionally uses words or phrases spontaneously, such as\n           “daddy go look.” She may say “French fries” when the family goes to\n           McDonald’s. She has made better eye contact recently, since starting\n           dietary supplements.\n\nId.\n\n       With regard to her previous medical history, Dr. Raymond noted the placement of\ntympanostomy tubes due to frequent otitis media, and recounted her normal\nneurological evaluation in September 2001, and hospitalization for severe temper\ntantrums in December 2001. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 25-26. He also noted that A.A. had been\ntaking a dietary supplement, “which include[d] chelation with EDTA,” for approximately\nthree weeks. 39 Id., p. 26. The supplement had reportedly improved her behaviors. Id.\nShe was also prescribed Klonopin. Id.\n\n       Following physical examination with normal results, Dr. Raymond assessed A.A.\nas “a 2-year, 6-month-old child who has had regression of language and social skills by\nparental report.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 27. He noted that her “[l]oss of language could be\nsuggestive of Landau-Kleffner’s syndrome; however, multiple EEG studies done in the\npast have been normal.” Id. Of specific concern were A.A.’s “poor pragmatic skills,\nlimited eye contact, and stereotypies. These features, with a history of regression, are\nsuggestive of autistic disorder. In her case, based on findings, Rett Syndrome should\nalso be considered.” Id. He recommended continued use of Klonopin to manage her\nbehaviors, but cautioned use of the dietary supplement. Id. He also recommended\nkaryotype, fragile X DNA, and Rett studies. 40 Id.\n\n       That same day, A.A. was seen by Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, a pediatric\nneurologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, for further evaluation of autistic symptoms.\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 23. Dr. Zimmerman’s report included the following history:\n\n           The parents report normal development until 11/00, when she underwent\n           regression 1-2 weeks following MMR immunization, with loss of language\n           and eye contact as well as social interaction. She is currently undergoing\n\n39\n     Testing of A.A.’s hair reportedly had revealed “high metal content and arsenic.” Pet. Ex. 8, p. 47.\n40\n  Fragile X genetic testing was normal. Pet. Exs. 6, p. 71; 15, p. 120. Rett syndrome genetic testing was\nnormal. Pet. Exs. 6, pp. 72-73; 15, pp.121-22. Both tests were performed on February 14, 2002.\n\n\n                                                       20\n\f      vitamin therapy and ‘GI support’, and has had trace metal testing of the\n      hair. She has been followed by Dr. Bennett Lavenstein and had normal\n      EEGs, including an overnight study, and cranial MRI scan. She has\n      shown increasing toe walking in recent months. Father feels her eye\n      contact is improving since starting ‘oral chelation’, which is obtained\n      through the mail. She uses up to 100 words inconsistently and tends to\n      lose single words that she has once used. She is now sleeping through\n      the night, though she has had episodes of awakenings every 2 hours, and\n      will have rage episodes with hitting her head and pulling her hair.\n\nId.\n\n       A.A. reportedly had exhibited “repetitive behaviors, hair-twirling and echolalia.”\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 23. Doctor Zimmerman assessed “her rating on the Childhood Autism\nRatings scale [as] 35-37, in the moderately autistic range.” Id. He noted that there was\nno family history of autism, and A.A. was an only child. Id. He conducted a physical\nexamination:\n\n      On exam, [A.A. was] fussy and reactive, does not engage or sustain eye\n      contact. Occasional word sounds [were] heard, as she responds to her\n      parents and seeks their attention briefly, and they are responsive to her. . .\n      . The cranium appears relatively small compared to the face, with large\n      features, and head circumference [in the] 50th percentile . . . . Tone is\n      moderate and symmetrical. She does not engage in a ball game, but\n      reaches into the can to obtain one. She climbs up and down a set of\n      steps repeatedly, has mild truncal instability but no tremor or movement\n      disorder. . . . Toe walking is persistent and increases with an instability of\n      her gait. The feet are plethoric in appearance (and are reported to change\n      color from pink to blue at times without apparent cause). Brief\n      hyperventilation episodes were reported on the exam earlier today.\n\nId.\n\n       Dr. Zimmerman concluded that A.A. “present[ed] an atypical history and\nappearance consistent with an encephalopathy and a pervasive development disorder\n(autism spectrum).” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24. Because of her “history of regressive\nencephalopathy,” he recommended genetic testing, as well as testing of quantitative\nplasma amino acids and urine organic acids. Id. He also recommended that she\ncontinue her treatment with Klonopin. Id.\n\n        On July 15, 2002, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up appointment.\nDuring the visit, A.A.’s mother reported that she had experienced “an increase in\nlanguage functions” due to her involvement in an infants and toddlers program, but had\n“lost some ground” after the program ended for the summer. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21. Doctor\nZimmerman noted that A.A. “ha[d] functional language, [but her] pragmatics [we]re still\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fpoor and she [did] not readily engage or relate.” Id. He planned to begin to taper her\nKlonopin dosage over the next few weeks. Id.; see also id., p. 88.\n\n       The report indicated that urinary organic acids had not been obtained, but that\n“[g]enetic testing was normal, including chromosomes and DNA for fragile X. Rett\nsyndrome genetic testing was normal. There is no family history of hearing loss or\nmuscle weakness (mitochondrial disorder).” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21. With regard to behavior,\nDr. Zimmerman reported that “[s]he marche[d] around the room and [was] continuously\nactive. She jump[ed] and ha[d] some hand flapping with excitement.” Id. He stated\nthat they again “reviewed the history of her loss of functions following MMR vaccine.\nShe has regressive encephalopathy with development of PDD (autism spectrum\ndisorder).” Id. He recommended that she have Applied Behavior Analysis [“ABA”]\ntherapy. 41 Id.\n\n       In addition to ABA therapy, Dr. Zimmerman recommended additional testing,\nincluding “quantitative urinary organic acids, fasting serum lactic acid, serum\nchemistries with liver function tests (especially AST), as well as CK (CPK),” 42 in view of\nthe possibility of mitochondrial disorder. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21. He stated “[m]itochondrial\ndisorders are difficult to diagnose, and some of them are responsive to specific vitamin\ntherapies.” Id. He noted at the conclusion of his report that A.A. “had normal\nquantitative amino acids, including the alanine/lysine ratio.” Id.\n\n        On November 4, 2002, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. A\nnursing report noted that A.A. was non-compliant and crying during intake procedures.\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 86. It also noted that she was being treated with vitamin therapy. Id.\nDuring the examination, A.A.’s mother reported increased sensory sensitivities and\nagitation since she stopped taking Klonopin. Pet. Exs. 6, p.19. But she noted that A.A.\nwas “showing more responsiveness in her therapies and [was] using a few words.” Id.\n\n        With regard to test results, Dr. Zimmerman noted that\n\n        [l]aboratory testing again showed a normal amino acid profile. Her plasma\n        lactate was 2.2 mM/L (0.7-2.1) and CPK was 196 IU/L (0-165) . . . and\n        calcium 10.6 (8.5-10.4). She was struggling when the test was done and,\n        by report, the tourniquet was not removed. These findings are further\n        suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder but not clearly diagnostic.\n        ...\n        We were able to obtain a urine specimen for quantitative organic acids\n        that will be sent to Dr. Kelly’s lab, and we also obtained a carnitine profile\n\n41\n  ABA therapy consists of the “application of learning theory based on operant conditioning” and “is the\nonly intervention recommended by the Surgeon General” for ASD.

Ex. 6, p.19.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman prescribed carnitine and folic acid and ordered a follow-up in\nthree months. The discharge diagnosis was “encephalopathy.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 85.\n\n       On November 15, 2002, A.A. was seen at Countryside due to a reported seizure\nthat morning. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 2. The medical record reflects that A.A. had a “grand mal”\nseizure, which lasted approximately three minutes. Id. She was taken to Countryside\non the advice of Dr. Zimmerman. Id. Physical examination was normal. Id. A.A.’s new\n“vitamin therapy” was mentioned. Id., p. 24. On November 23, 2002, A.A. was treated\nfor pharyngitis and viral infection. Id., p. 23. She reportedly “missed school all week.”\nId.\n\n       On January 13, 2003, A.A. had another EEG, the results of which indicated “a\nfocal cerebral disturbance of the right temporal region, but possibly involving the right\ncerebral hemisphere diffusely.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 54. The reporting physician noted “no\nclear epileptiform discharges,” but could “not rule out an epileptic disorder.” Id. He\nrecommended an imaging study be performed “to evaluate for structural abnormalities.”\nId.\n\n       A.A. was seen at Countryside on January 21, 2003, due to another reported\ngrand mal seizure that morning, which lasted about two minutes. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 22. The\nmedical report noted that she was scheduled to see Dr. Zimmerman the following day,\nbut that he wanted her to be seen at Countryside “because she ha[d] had 4 seizures\nsince [the] new year.” Id. Physical examination was normal, with the exception of an\ninflamed right tympanic membrane, diagnosed as acute OM. Id.\n\n        On January 22, 2003, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. Dr.\nZimmerman discussed A.A.’s most recent EEG results and noted that she had had four\n“generalized tonic-clonic seizures, apparently nonfocal, over the past several weeks\nafter starting a trial of Carnitor (L-carnitine), [which] was discontinued about 3 weeks\nago.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15. Although her last seizure occurred the previous day and she\nwas presently alert, her mother observed “intermittent episodes of convergence spasm\n\n43\n  The report from the repeat testing noted these results as “CK = 201 IU/L (24-170); Calcium 10.7 [8.5-\n10.4]; AST 44 U/L (0-31); CO2=19; carnitine profile normal; organic acids – normal.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19;\nsee also Pet. Exs. 6, p. 56 (Johns Hopkins lab report dated Nov. 4, 2002); 6, p. 57 (KKI genetics lab\nreport dated Nov. 7, 2002); 6, p. 58 (KKI mass spectrometry lab report dated Nov. 8, 2002).\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fof the eyes” during the “past week or so.” Id. A.A.’s speech, however, had reportedly\nimproved while taking Carnitor. Id.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman noted a limited familial history of seizures, but stated that\nA.A.’s MRI films from October 2001 appeared normal, “showing no focal abnormalities\non the right side.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15. He recounted that she had “a history of normal\ndevelopment until about 2 weeks after her MMR immunization at 18 [sic] months of age.\nUp to that time, she knew her colors and was using words and was pointing. She\nbegan repetitive behaviors and declined in her speech production with her regression.”\nId. The seizures, however, were “a new onset.” Id. This history is significantly different\nfrom the medical records showing A.A.’s skill level at the time of vaccination and from\nthe histories provided before her parents asserted that the MMR vaccine was causal.\nSee, e.g., Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10 (pediatrician assessment at one-year checkup indicating\nA.A. knew one to three words); Pet. Ex. 5, p. 4 (parental report to speech-language\npathologist on September 5, 2001, stating that A.A. spoke “her first word ‘Quack’ at 1\nyear and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months”), p. 5 (she “stopped\nspeaking after having 3 ear infections in a row”); Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96 (parental report to Dr.\nLavenstein on September 6, 2001, that at 15 months A.A. “had some oral sounds”; Dr.\nLavenstein’s characterization of her speech at that time as “primitive”).\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman planned a repeat EEG in six weeks, after starting A.A. on\nDepakote. “Depending on the results of her repeat EEG . . . we may wish to repeat her\nMRI scan, if right sided or other focal abnormalities persist.” Pet. Ex. 6, p.15. He also\nrecommended updated bloodwork for “CBC, AST and a valproic acid level.” Id. Any\ndecision “to reinstitute treatment with carnitine and other ‘mitochondrial vitamins’” would\nbe determined at a later date. Id. Dr. Zimmerman prescribed Depakote and ordered a\nfollow-up in six weeks. Id. The discharge diagnosis was, again, encephalopathy. Id.,\np. 82.\n\n       Another EEG was performed on March 3, 2003, pursuant to Dr. Zimmerman’s\norder. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 50. The record reflected “no seizure discharges or localizing signs”\nand was improved as compared to the one obtained on January 13, 2003. Id. The\nexaminer also noted that “[t]he focal attenuation of activity noticed over the right side on\nthe previous recording was not present in the current record; however, it must be kept in\nmind that there were fewer recording channels in the current record.” Id.\n\n       That same day, A.A. was also seen by Dr. Zimmerman. He noted that A.A. was\ncurrently taking Depakote and had only “a single seizure [the previous] week after sleep\ndeprivation and none ha[d] recurred.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 13. He also reported that “[s]everal\nstudies suggest[ed] that [A.A.] has signs of a mitochondrial disorder.” Id. As a result,\nhe contacted Dr. Richard Kelley and asked him to review A.A.’s chart. Id. He intended\nto ask Dr. Kelley to see A.A. clinically “to review studies[,] comment on any further\ntesting[,] . . . [and] recommend treatment.” Id. In the meantime, Dr. Zimmerman started\nA.A. on coenzyme Q, folic acid, and thiamine; however, restarting Carnitor would be\npostponed “pending Dr. Kelley’s recommendation.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f         On April 8, 2003, A.A. was seen by Dr. Richard Kelley, a metabolic specialist at\nthe Kennedy Krieger Institute, for further evaluation and recommendations for\ntreatment. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 3. In his report, Dr. Kelley recounted A.A.’s relevant history, as\nprovided by her parents and medical records. Id. Consistent with previous accounts,\nA.A. reportedly “did well in the neonatal period and appeared to be a healthy, thriving\ngirl for the remainder of the first year.” Id. “[L]anguage acquisition continued to develop\nnormally up until the age of 15 months when, approximately one to two weeks after her\nMMR immunization, [A.A.] progressively lost most of her language, visual contact, and\nnormal social interaction over several weeks.” Id. Extensive testing and evaluation “to\ndetermine the cause of the losses [provided] no explanation for her autistic regression.”\nId. Then, in February 2002, A.A. was seen by Dr. Zimmerman. Although she had\nregained some of her language, “and to some degree, her socialization” by the time of\nthe evaluation, “she continued to have major behavioral problems, including self-injury.”\nId. At that examination, she demonstrated “persistent toe-walking as well as some gait\ninstability, suggesting . . . a primary neurological disorder and not idiopathic autistic\nspectrum disorder.” Id.\n\n       In view of the “early regressive nature of [A.A.’s] pervasive developmental\ndisorder and the abnormalities in [her] neurological examination, Dr. Zimmerman was\nconcerned that [she] might have a metabolic disease or other genetic disorder causing\nher progressive developmental and neurological losses.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 3. He “obtained\na number of basic laboratory studies for diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism.” 44 Id.\n\n          These showed several abnormalities, including an increased plasma\n          alanine level, increased ratio of AST to ALT, mildly increased creatine\n          kinase level, mildly increased blood lactate level, and electrolyte evidence\n          of a mild metabolic acidosis. Negative diagnostic testing for identifiable\n          causes of autistic spectrum disorder included Fragile X testing, Rett\n          syndrome mutation analysis, plasma carnitine profile, and urinary organic\n          acid analysis. Taken together, the laboratory abnormalities suggested an\n          inborn error of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Interesting with regard\n          to [A.A.’s] having a possible mitochondrial disorder is that, although frank\n          hypoglycemia has never been documented, [A.A.] seems to [be] very\n          sensitive to fasting and, according her parents, ‘melts’ if she misses a\n          between-meal snack. She also sometimes becomes ‘stuporous’ within 15\n          to 20 minutes of a meal and often wants to eat in the middle of the night.\n\nId.\n\n      In view of the “biochemical evidence for a mitochondrial disorder . . ., and\nbecause of success in treating similar children with pharmacological amounts of\nmitochondrial cofactors,” Dr. Zimmerman had started A.A. on “stepwise\nsupplementation with carnitine, thiamine, and folic acid[.]” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 4. A.A.\nbecame “very excitable and agitated on carnitine,” however, and also experienced\n\n44\n     The report summarized the results of the diagnostic testing undertaken to date. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 4-5.\n\n\n                                                      25\n\fseveral grand mal seizures. Id. Treatment with carnitine was discontinued and an\nanticonvulsant was prescribed. Id. With regard to the effectiveness of carnitine, Dr.\nKelley noted:\n\n      Although there was suspicion that the seizures had been brought on by\n      treatment with carnitine, [A.A.’s] last seizure prior to initiation of\n      anticonvulsive therapy occurred three weeks after stopping carnitine.\n      After starting treatment with Depakote, [A.A.] . . . had no further seizures.\n      However, [she] remains significantly more excitable and agitated than\n      prior to initiation of any of these medications and supplements. As a\n      result, [A.A.’s] parents suspect that some of [her] worsening behavior has\n      been caused by Depakote. Also important is that [A.A] was noted to be\n      much more alert and focused in school after starting treatment with\n      carnitine, an observation that was made by teachers who at the time were\n      unaware of [her] new medication.\n\nId.\n\n        Doctor Kelley noted that A.A. did not have a history of any significant illness or\nhospitalizations. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 4. It is not clear whether Dr. Kelley was unaware of her\nprevious hospitalization for tantrums and constipation in December 2001, or whether he\ndid not consider this event significant. He stated that “[a]part from the above history,\n[A.A. showed] no signs or symptoms of a metabolic disease such as food intolerance,\nchronic vomiting or diarrhea, recurrent infections, abnormal rashes, unusual odors, or\ndecompensation with otherwise simple childhood infections (apart from the MMR\nimmunization).” Id. He noted, however, that she “may have had more than the usual\nnumber of ear infections and has required frequent treatment with antibiotics as well as\nbilateral tympanostomy.” Id. A complete physical examination was not undertaken, as\nthe “visit was primarily for consultation regarding pharmacological treatment.” Id., p. 5.\n\n      In his assessment, Dr. Kelley explained:\n\n      Although autism in most children remains a diagnosis without known\n      cause, [A.A.] . . . has many of the historical and laboratory characteristics\n      that we now associate with a particular form of autistic spectrum disorder\n      caused by an inborn error of mitochondrial metabolism. Children with this\n      disorder (possibly a group of disorders), typically appear to be normal for\n      their first 12 months or more before a viral illness or other stress[,] such as\n      an immunization[,] provides the critical metabolic stress that sufficiently\n      taxes or compromises energy metabolism in the brain to precipitate acute\n      or subacute cognitive and motor deterioration. For reasons that most\n      likely are explained by changes in neurotransmitter receptor densities in\n      the brain, the period between 12 and 36 months is the time when children\n      with these mitochondrial disturbances appear to be most susceptible to\n      brain injury. Such injury may occur once or several times with additional\n      stresses, or, more rarely, a child may regress for many months, even in\n\n\n                                            26\n\f          the absence of specific stresses like infections or immunizations. Most\n          likely because the greatest susceptibility for brain [sic] occurs during a\n          peak period of language and social development, children who sustain this\n          type of mitochondrial injury often develop signs of autistic spectrum\n          disorder.\n\nId.\n\n          He then stated:\n\n          In addition to historical information consistent with an inborn error of\n          energy metabolism, [A.A.’s] laboratory studies are similar to those of other\n          children with autistic spectrum disorders and mitochondrial disease, which\n          for shorthand we call ‘mitochondrial PDD.’ These include a distinctly\n          increased level of plasma alanine relative to essential amino acids, a high\n          ratio of AST to ALT, mildly increased creatine kinase level, and mild\n          metabolic acidosis. Although [A.A.’s] plasma lactate level was only\n          borderline increased at 2.2 mM, the lack of a distinct lactic acidosis in\n          children with mitochondrial PDD together with an increased alanine level\n          is quite characteristic. This is also consistent with muscle biopsy studies\n          in mitochondrial PDD children, which typically show a significant block at\n          the level of complex I, the primary site of oxidation of pyruvate. Alanine,\n          being the amino acid form of pyruvate, is secondarily increased, but more\n          useful as a diagnostic marker because its degree of elevation can be\n          expressed relative to other amino acids, and it is not subject to artifacts\n          commonly encountered in doing pyruvate and lactate measurements. The\n          mildly increased levels of AST and creatine kinase are presumed to reflect\n          the involvement of muscle tissue, which, second only to the brain, has the\n          highest demand for mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n\nId., pp. 5-6.\n\n        Doctor Kelley also discussed A.A.’s “hyperactivity reaction” to carnitine, which he\nexplained was “not uncommon in mitochondrial PDD.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 6. With regard to\nher first seizure, he found it unlikely, “based on extensive international experience with\ncarnitine treatment of metabolic disorders, that carnitine could be the primary cause of a\nseizure disorder, only the particular factor that demonstrates a child’s predisposition to\nhaving seizures. Indeed, seizures are relatively common in mitochondrial PDD before\nany pharmacological treatments are begun.” Id. Despite A.A.’s reaction, Dr. Kelley\nbelieved carnitine was beneficial and recommended A.A. restart the treatment. Id. In\naddition, he recommended “starting the combination of vitamins now commonly used in\nthe treatment of mitochondrial diseases.” 45 Id. The vitamin therapy was planned to\ncontinue “until at least age five years. Id. In the meantime, Dr. Kelley encouraged A.A.\nto “continue to be followed by Dr. Zimmerman and her developmental specialists to\nmonitor her progress.” Id. Although he found it unnecessary that she return for\n45\n     The vitamin mixture was coenzyme Q10, vitamins C and E, thiamine, and lipoic acid. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 7.\n\n                                                     27\n\f“continued formal evaluation” at his clinic, he offered to provide advice or consultation\nas necessary regarding adjustments to her medications. Id., p. 7.\n\n       Finally, Dr. Kelley noted that although “the specific genetic lesion or lesions\ncausing mitochondrial PDD” are not known, mitochondrial enzymatic analysis of muscle\nbiopsies from “several similar children” have “almost always [shown] exactly the same\nbiochemical profile.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 7. As a result, “undertaking an invasive and\nexpensive muscle biopsy at this time would not seem to have any practical value.” Id.\n\n       On July 14, 2003, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. He noted\nthat she had been doing “remarkably well on the mitochondrial regimen” and provided a\nfavorable evaluation. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 1. He reported:\n\n       Today her eye contact is notably improved and she sustains it for several\n       seconds and is briefly interactive. She plays with imagination with a toy\n       stove and stays busy with it. She is heard to sing words clearly and is\n       using single words and word combinations. Her sleep has improved,\n       although she is up about once per week during the night and is ‘wired’ for\n       a few hours. This is gradually improving. She has remained seizure free\n       on Tegretol . . . . She still is having difficulty with transitions and sensory\n       sensitivities. Her growth has improved with increase in weight . . . from\n       60th to 95th percentile, and height . . . represents increase from 50th to\n       75th percentile in the last four months.\n\nId.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman noted that A.A.’s positive response to the mitochondrial\nregimen indicated a possible “underlying mitochondrial dysfunction which may be from a\nnuclear gene that affects the mitochondria.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 1. He ordered bloodwork and\na follow-up in three months. Id.; id, p. 76; see also Pet. Ex. 15, pp. 98-99 (laboratory\nresults).\n\n       On July 14, 2003, Dr. Kelly provided a letter excusing A.A. from further\nvaccination due to her condition. The letter stated that A.A. “has autistic spectrum\ndisorder and biochemical evidence of a mitochondrial disease.” It explained that “the\nphysiological stress of a vaccine” can trigger the “onset of brain injury in children with\nmitochondrial disease . . . as was the case for [A.A.] at the time of her MMR\nimmunization.” For this reason, it was recommended that A.A. not receive any further\nMMR or cellular pertussis vaccines until she passed “the window of greatest\nvulnerability for brain injury,” which in children with A.A.’s “type of metabolic disorder” is\nsix years of age. Pet. Ex. 11, p. 162.\n\n       On October 27, 2003, A.A. returned to Dr. Zimmerman for a follow-up visit. The\nmedical report reflected that A.A. “seem[ed] to be doing quite well on the mitochondrial\nvitamin supplements.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 160. She had been seizure free since January\n2003, and the plan was to taper her off the anticonvulsant once she reached the two-\n\n\n                                              28\n\fyear point. Id. Laboratory results were generally within normal limits, including a\ncomprehensive metabolic panel. Id.; see also Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 52-53.\n\n       On March 15, 2004, A.A. presented for a routine neurology follow-up with Dr.\nZimmerman. According to her parents, A.A. had recently experienced a “regression” in\nher behaviors and skills. Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 155-56. She was having increased sensory\nintegration problems, including frequent temper tantrums, and appeared less happy\nthan usual. Id. Additionally, certain behaviors had returned or increased, including\nteeth grinding, stereotypic behaviors, humming, and toe walking. Id., p. 155. It had also\nbecome harder for her to transition to new situations and she was observed by her\nparents and teachers to be “more lethargic” and “less focused in the afternoon.” Id., pp.\n155-56. Of particular concern was a teacher report that A.A. had recently had a brief\nstaring spell and “did not respond for a short time.” Id., p. 155. Her father also reported\nobserving a possible seizure-like episode, but was not certain. Id. Although A.A.\n“continue[d] to speak occasionally” and “respond to specific choices given to her, [she\ndid] not make spontaneous speech.” Id. She was “learning things,” but her parents\nwere considering her placement in “a special education kindergarten program where\nshe w[ould] be pulled into regular programs in school.” Id., p. 156. It was noted that\nA.A. “ha[d] been on the mitochondrial vitamins for one year . . . with no change in the\ndosage.” Id., p. 155.\n\n        The impression was that A.A. had undergone a regression in her behaviors and\nskills. Pet. Ex. 11, p. 156. The plan was to slowly increase her mitochondrial vitamins\nto their target dosage. Id. The possible staring spells were “concerning,” so the plan\nwas to increase her anticonvulsant medication. Id., p. 157. A follow-up was scheduled\nin three months. Id. Subsequent laboratory results were generally within normal limits,\nwith the exception of creatine, AST, and her platelet count. Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 48-49. Her\nplasma carnitine was within normal limits. Pet. Ex. 12, p. 50.\n\n       On June 14, 2004, A.A. returned for a neurology follow-up with Dr. Zimmerman.\nThe medical report reflected that A.A. had improved since the previous visit and\n“continued to do quite well on the mitochondrial vitamins.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 148. She was\nkept at her current levels, with no intention of ending the treatment “anytime soon, since\nthey seem to be working very effectively.” Id. Because she had been seizure-free for a\nyear and a half, they planned to begin tapering her anticonvulsant medications. Id.\n\n        By December 2005, A.A. was off her anticonvulsant medication and doing well.\nPet. Ex. 11, p. 135-36. In December 2008, Dr. Zimmerman planned to taper A.A. off of\nthe vitamin cocktail to determine whether there was “still indication of mitochondrial\ndysfunction.” Pet. Ex. 12, p. 1. Although it is not clear from the record whether this\noccurred, Dr. Zimmerman later wrote, in a June 21, 2010 evaluation, that A.A. continued\nto have “clinical suggestion of mitochondrial dysfunction.”46 Pet. Ex. 15, p. 1. As of the\n\n46\n  In his evaluation, Dr. Zimmerman noted: “When she was off all mitochondrial vitamins she seemed to\nregress and Father has noted that she improves after each morning dose of Carnitor[.] . . . Mother is not\nsure whether there is benefit from it, but agrees to continue with the treatment.” Pet. Ex. 15, p. 1.\n\n\n                                                    29\n\fmost current record, A.A. continued to take Carnitor and the mitochondrial cocktail. Pet.\nEx. 64, pp. 1-2.\n\n       Petitioners submitted medical records dated through April 2012, at which time\nA.A. was 12 years old. The records reflected regular treatment with her pediatrician 47\nand ongoing care with Dr. Zimmerman and others at KKI. Pet. Exs. 61, pp. 16, 18-20,\n23-28, 30-31, 33-34 (Countryside Pediatrics); 15, pp. 1, 49-52 (KKI); 64, pp. 1-2 ( KKI).\n\n                  IV. Summary of Fact Testimony and Supporting Evidence.\n\n       At the July 10, 2013 hearing, A.A.’s father, James Allen, and her maternal aunt,\nSusan Edick, testified with regard to A.A.’s health and development prior to her October\n23, 2000 MMR vaccination, and the changes they observed over the ensuing months.\nMr. Allen and Ms. Edick provided additional evidence in the form of written affidavits.\nSee Pet. Exs. 78, 79. Video and photographic evidence was also submitted. See Pet.\nExs. 60, 75, 80, 81 (video); 76 (photos); Trial Exs. 1-3 (photos).\n\nA. Mr. James Allen.\n\n       Mr. Allen testified that A.A. had a “healthy” birth and was regularly evaluated by\nher pediatrician, who expressed no concerns during her first year of development.\nNeither of A.A.’s parents had any concerns about her development either. Tr. at 6-7;\nPet. Ex. 78 at 2.\n\n        A.A. reached a notable milestone just prior to her first birthday, when she took\nher first steps during a family vacation to the Outer Banks over the 4th of July holiday.\nTr. at 7-8; Pet. Ex. 78 at 2. A photograph taken during the trip showed A.A. standing on\nthe beach, smiling and playfully tugging on a rope attached to a boogie board. 48 Mr.\nAllen recalled that A.A. was happy on the trip, laughing and giggling. Tr. at 8; Pet. Ex.\n78 at 2. He noted that “[o]nce she started walking, it wasn’t long before she was\nrunning, too.” Tr. at 8.\n\n       Early on, she also developed “a strong liking [for] the water” and enjoyed going to\nthe swimming pool. Tr. at 9. Mr. Allen stated that they frequently took A.A. to a local\nswimming pool where she “would go in the wading pool and splash with other children.”\nPet. Ex. 78 at 3. One of her favorite places, though, was a large waterpark near their\nhome. Tr. at 9; Pet. Ex. 78 at 3. He recalled that whenever A.A. visited the park, she\nwas actively engaged with her surroundings—running, splashing, and playing with other\nchildren. Tr. at 9; Pet. Ex. 78 at 3. Her affinity for water was reportedly illustrated by a\nphoto of A.A. with her mother in a pool. 49 The photo, which showed A.A. “kind of doing\n47\n     A.A. continued to suffer from recurrent OM.\n48\n     A photograph of the trip to the Outer Banks was used as Pet. Trial Ex. 1.\n49\n  A photograph of her swimming with her mother was used as Pet. Trial Ex. 3. Mr. Allen noted that A.A.\nwas looking directly at the camera in the photograph. Tr. at 17.\n\n\n                                                      30\n\fthe doggie paddle thing,” was taken during “the summer of 2000, around her birthday.”\nTr. at 17.\n\n       With regard to her personality, A.A. was becoming “kind of a jokester.” Tr. at 9.\nFor example, when asked “how big” she was, A.A. would “smile, extend her arms and\nsay ‘Soooo big’ and wait for everyone to laugh.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 4; see also Tr. at 9-10.\nShe could tell “knock-knock” jokes, too, although she “hadn’t quite learned to hold back\nher laughter until the punch line[.]”50 Pet. Ex. 78 at 3-4; see also Tr. at 10. She also\nloved animals and often played with the family’s dogs. Tr. at 10; Pet. Ex. 78 at 5.\n\n        Mr. Allen testified that members of both sides of the family observed A.A. during\nher first year, and none expressed concern or reported any strange behaviors. Tr. at\n11-12. Indeed, she “was actually accelerating, growing.” Tr. at 12. According to Mr.\nAllen, she played well with other children, had no difficulty with eye contact, and\nresponded when called to by name. Tr. at 10-12. She was “very social.” Tr. at 11. In\nfact, by her first birthday, A.A. reportedly had learned to use “well over 100 words.” Tr.\nat 70-72. In view of the other evidence regarding A.A.’s language at one year of age,\nthis testimony cannot be accurate.\n\n       On her first birthday (July 21, 2000), A.A.’s parents threw a small party attended\nby family and friends. Tr. at 12-13. A photograph taken that day shows A.A. next to her\nbirthday cake. 51\n\n       In the fall of that year, over the Labor Day holiday, petitioners visited A.A.’s\nmaternal aunt and family [“the Edicks”] at their home in Syracuse, New York. Pet. Ex.\n78 at 3. Mr. Allen described A.A. as active during their stay and specifically recalled her\nplaying croquet with him and several of her cousins in the backyard. Id. at 4. Although\n“she could only hit the ball about three feet, . . . she tried. She knew how to play. She\nunderstood the colors.” Tr. at 33; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 4. One of his memories was\nof her “saying she was ‘a big girl’ while holding the croquet mallet and trying to hit the\nball.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 4. A photograph taken that weekend 52 showed A.A. outside during\na game of croquet, standing independently with a ball in her hands.\n\n       On October 14, 2000, the family visited a local pumpkin patch to purchase a few\npumpkins. Mr. Allen recalled that A.A. was full of energy that day and enjoyed the\nexperience. He specifically remembered her playing on playground equipment and\n\n50\n  This statement is simply not credible. At one year of age, A.A.’s pediatrician assessed her with having\none to three words, which was considered to be normal development. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10. Two to three\nword sentences were not expected until age two years. See Pet. Ex. 9, p. 4. Indeed, petitioners\nthemselves reported that A.A. spoke her first word “quack” at one year and spoke “a little more/using\nanimal sounds” at 15 months. See Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5.\n51\n     A photograph on her first birthday was used as Pet. Trial Ex. 2.\n52\n  Pet. Ex. 76; see Tr. at 115 (Ms. Susan Edick testified that she took the photograph on September 3,\n2000).\n\n\n                                                       31\n\fhelping to choose the pumpkins. Tr. at 19-20. “She was like a kid in a candy store,\nbasically.” Tr. at 21. Video from that day showed A.A. walking and touching the\npumpkins. 53 In one segment, she was seen “pushing” a wheelbarrow while holding her\nmother’s hand. Tr. at 20. Mr. Allen also thought she might have danced to some music\nplaying in the background. Tr. at 21. His recollection from that activity was of A.A.\n“engaging with people, . . . with her mom and her dad, too.” Tr. at 22.\n\n        Mr. Allen also videotaped A.A. at home on that same day in various situations—\nfrom running around the house to eating dinner. 54 In one clip, A.A. was standing in her\ncrib looking at the camera. Mr. Allen described her as “a little grumpy” after having just\nawakened from a nap. Tr. at 15. In another, she was in the bathtub splashing and\nplaying with some toys. Mr. Allen noted that she made eye contact and was “very\ninteractive.” Id. During her bath, A.A. was playing with a rubber ducky and splashed\nherself with water, “which she liked to do.” Id. He recalled her saying “quack, quack”\nwhen asked what sound a duck makes, although the sound does not appear on the\nvideos. Tr. at 15-17. She “loved to make animal sounds,” but her “first words were da-\nda.” Tr. at 15. 55\n\n        After her bath, A.A. was videotaped playfully running around her parents’\nbedroom. See Pet. Ex. 60. When asked if she was vocalizing during the clip, Mr. Allen\nresponded: “Yes. A little bit. Really she was kind of doing the quack-quack still after\nthe bath, yeah.” Tr. at 18. In a subsequent segment, she was engaged in a “game”\nwith her father that involved her being chased “down the main hallway on the second\nfloor.” Tr. at 25. “That was a tickler bug thing . . . you know ‘I’m going to get you[.]’”\nTr. at 25. In the clip she also kissed her favorite stuffed toy—a teddy bear. Tr. at 26. In\nanother scene, A.A. danced to a song playing on Sesame Street. Tr. at 28- 29. A later\nclip showed her seated in a high chair eating dinner. At the end of that clip she\nappeared to imitate her father. He explained: “I was doing the ‘rah’ and she was doing it\nback.” Tr. at 29.\n\n       On October 23, 2000, A.A. received a MMR vaccination. Although Mr. Allen was\npresent at the appointment, he could not recall any details. Tr. at 102-04. He did,\nhowever, remember noticing changes in her behavior following the appointment, but not\nnecessarily on that day. Tr. at 73. He specifically recollected a developing awareness\nthat something was wrong during a neighborhood Halloween party the family attended\non October 29, 2000. Tr. at 77. The daytime, outdoor event included treats, games,\nand a participatory parade for the children to show off their costumes. Tr. at 30-31; Pet.\n\n53\n     Video of A.A. on October 14, 2000. Pet. Ex. 60.\n54\n   Video of A.A. on October 14, 2000. Pet. Ex. 60. Despite confessing his love for recording his\ndaughter’s life (Tr. at 14.), Mr. Allen was able to find video from only three events of her entire childhood.\nIn view of his comments, I find the lack of other videos from holidays or birthdays in this period\ninexplicable and concerning for spoliation of evidence.\n55\n  This statement is contrary to earlier reports. See, e.g., Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5 (reporting that her first word was\n“quack”).\n\n\n                                                       32\n\fEx. 78 at 4-5. She did not want to walk in the parade and displayed little interest in\ninteracting with other children or participating in the activities. Tr. at 31; Pet. Ex. 78 at 4-\n5. She really “seemed inattentive and passive.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 5. She “just stood in one\nplace like a mannequin”—she “looked stoned.” Tr. at 31. While there were “brief\nmoments” when she “would take one step, two steps here, one or two steps [t]here,”\nshe did not really walk, and definitely did not run. Tr. at 36-37.\n\n      Mr. Allen contrasted this behavior with her actions over the Labor Day weekend,\nwhen she eagerly played croquet in her aunt’s backyard. Tr. at 32-33. On that\noccasion, she was “interacting and playing games”—she wanted “to be like a big girl,” to\nunderstand the rules and learn how to play. Tr. at 32-33. At the Halloween party,\nhowever, she did not play games, or want to walk, stand, or interact with the other kids.\nHe recalled thinking that “maybe she’s really shy or something.”\n\n       In video taken during the neighborhood Halloween party, A.A. was seen standing\nwith other children waiting for family and friends to take photographs of the group. 56 Tr.\nat 35. Mr. Allen recalled that afterwards A.A. just stood in place until every other child\nhad left. Id. He thought she would want to follow them for the parade, but she did not.\nId. Rather than walk, she allowed her mother to carry her for a while and then push her\nin a cart. Id. Mr. Allen observed the absence of eye contact or any sounds during the\nsegment and noted that when they spoke to her, she showed no response. Tr. at 35-\n36. “You can hear the birds, but you don’t hear her.” Tr. at 36.\n\n       Her disinterest “was kind of startling” to him—“[i]t was a big change.” Tr. at 37.\nIn the past, she would have had “her hands in everything.” Tr. at 38. But on that day\nshe was not engaged. Id. As an example, he remembered that they tried without\nsuccess to get her to play a beanbag toss game. Id. They “had to walk it up . . . and\nshe’d put it through the hole and that was it.” Id. The other children “sort of ran by her.”\nId. He remembered thinking “maybe she’s got a bug or something or maybe she’s just\nhaving a bad day.” Id.\n\n       According to Mr. Allen, that day (October 29, 2000) marked the beginning of\nnoticeable changes in A.A.’s behavior. Tr. at 38. From there she gradually stopped\nspeaking and interacting, and her personality changed. Id.\n\n       That night, when she developed a fever and refused to eat, petitioners became\nconcerned. Tr. at 78. Because her fever was over 100 degrees, they contacted A.A.’s\ndoctor, who told them to administer Tylenol and to call back or come in if the fever did\nnot subside. Tr. at 78-79. There is no record of this telephone call. The fever lasted\nfour days, during which it “kind of spiked and . . . went down and spiked again.” Tr. at\n39-40. As a result of her illness, A.A. was unable to trick-or-treat on Halloween night.\nId.; see also Tr. at 79-80 (testified that they contacted doctor twice); Pet. Ex. 78 at 5.\nThey did not take her to the doctor. Tr. at 80-81.\n\n\n\n56\n     Video of A.A. on October 29, 2000. See Pet. Ex. 80, 81.\n\n                                                     33\n\f        Mr. Allen stated that he and A.A.’s mother speculated as to the cause of the\nillness, but remained uncertain. Initially, they wondered if it was something she had\neaten—perhaps too much candy or she had developed an allergy. Tr. at 40-41. They\nalso considered that it was a “’bug,’ like the flu[,]” or that she was maybe teething. As a\nnew parent, the situation “was disconcerting.” Tr. at 41; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 5.\nHowever, this was not A.A.’s first illness.\n\n       According to Mr. Allen, A.A.’s behavior changed significantly after the fever. He\nstated that she was sleepy, cried at night, and wanted to go to bed early. Tr. at 81. She\nno longer was “talkative” and would not respond or make eye contact. Tr. at 41. She\nalso stopped “watching Sesame Street and dancing.” Id. Instead, she would sit on the\ncarpet and pull pieces of thread. Id. She “wasn’t mobile like other kids.” Id. He could\nnot recall, though, whether he or his wife contacted A.A.’s physician about her\nworsening symptoms. Tr. at 81-82; see also Tr. at 45.\n\n        Over the Veterans Day weekend in November 2000, the Edicks visited\npetitioners at their home in Virginia. Tr. at 42. During their visit, the two families made\na trip to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Id. The zoo was A.A.’s “favorite place”\nbecause she liked animals—especially monkeys, which she previously had watched\nwith fascination. Tr. at 42; Pet. Ex. 78 at 5. On this occasion, however, she was\ndisinterested, and cried and fussed. Tr. at 43. Mr. Allen recalled thinking that “her\nbehavior and lack of activity was because she was recovering from a bug.” Pet. Ex. 78\nat 5; see also Tr. at 43, 83. Because of her tantrums and crying, the trip was cut short.\nTr. at 43; Pet. Ex. 78 at 6. “During this weekend,” he also “noticed that [A.A.] seemed\nunsteady on her feet” and often “crawl[ed] to her destination.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 5. She\ntalked less, too. Tr. at 84. Petitioners did not take A.A. to the doctor, however. Tr. at\n83-84.\n\n       Later that month, on Thanksgiving, the family gathered at Mr. Allen’s\ngrandfather’s farm. Tr. at 43. At some point that day, Mr. Allen recalled talking to his\nmother about his concerns. Tr. at 44. He stated that she expressed concern, too,\nbecause A.A. was crawling more than walking. Id. She also seemed content to sit\nalone by herself. Tr. at 45; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 6. This was noticeably different from\nher behavior on October 14th, when she was “running around, . . . interactive with other\nkids.” Tr. at 45. In retrospect, Mr. Allen wished that he had called the doctor, but stated\nthat other than reporting that he could not “get a great Kodak moment,” he was not sure\nwhat he would have said. Tr. at 45.\n\n       Throughout the month of December 2000 “all [A.A.] wanted to do was sleep.”\nPet. Ex. 78 at 7. She also had frequent tantrums. Tr. at 86. “Her temperament\nchanged from a child with a big personality to one who would only smile occasionally.\nMostly, however, she stared off into space[.]” Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. On December 18, 2000,\nA.A. was seen by her pediatrician; however, Mr. Allen could not recall whether he\nattended or what was discussed. 57 Tr. at 84. Her behavioral problems continued to\n\n57\n     The medical record on December 18, 2000, reflects a diagnosis of early OM. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 57.\n\n\n                                                     34\n\fChristmas, which made the holiday a “disappointment.” Tr. at 46. Petitioners stayed\nhome for Christmas and were joined by A.A.’s maternal grandparents. Id. Although\nthere were a lot of gifts, A.A. showed no interest in opening any of them on Christmas\nmorning. Tr. at 46; Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. She even “cried when a gift was placed in front of\nher and left the room.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. Mr. Allen remembered that she “still seemed\nsickly,” having had an earache the prior week. Tr. at 46. Mr. Allen shot video on\nChristmas Day, 58 but noted that most of the clips showed “the good moments”—\nbecause “she was crying a lot,” they had to reshoot numerous times. Tr. at 47-48. He\nremembered that she was miserable “[t]hrough the entire day all the way up to dinner”\nand was put to bed early. Tr. at 49. “For a kid on Christmas,” her behavior was “kind of\nsurprising.” Tr. at 48. He contrasted her unhappiness with how she behaved on her\nbirthday: “opening every little gift . . . and . . . going through the cake.” Tr. at 50.\n\n        The day after Christmas, A.A. appeared to feel better, so petitioners tried again\nto get some “Kodak moments.” Tr. at 50. However, despite being more cooperative,\nher behavior was still unusual. Though she showed increased interest in her toys, she\ndid not play with them “appropriately.” Tr. at 50. For example, one of the gifts was a set\nof toy kitchenware, which she banged against a nearby clock and stacked in piles\ninstead of pretending to fix food. Tr. at 50-51. Mr. Allen stated that this was unusual—\n“before[,] she wasn’t like that.” Tr. at 51. “She was in a world of her own.” Pet. Ex. 78\nat 7.\n\n       After Christmas, A.A. “never really went back to where she was,” and it was\n“years” before she started talking again. Tr. at 51. Petitioners eventually decided to\nseek the help of specialists, because they had received no “clear answers” from her\ntreating physicians. Tr. at 52. He recalled the frustration he felt:\n\n          I’m going to the pediatrician and they’re treating her ear, they’re treating\n          her nose, they’re treating her finger, they’re treating her bellyache, they’re\n          treating her fever. They’re treating symptoms; they’re not treating the\n          whole problem. . . . And you walk out and you feel better for about a half a\n          day until you’re home again.\n\nTr. at 52. However, the medical records reflect that A.A.’s pediatrician was actively\nengaged in her care and responsive to her parents’ concerns.\n\n       On March 1, 2001, petitioners took A.A. to her 18-month well child visit. Tr. at\n86. Although he could not remember anything specific about the visit, Mr. Allen knew\nhe was concerned about her loss of speech and eye contact. Tr. at 86-87. According\nto the pediatrician’s notes of that visit, A.A. did not display some of the expected skills\nfor a child her age, including the ability to speak 4-10 words. See Pet. Ex. 9, p. 8. It\nwas noted that there had been “problems” with the previous nanny, but that A.A. was\n“opening up more” with the replacement. Id. The record indicated that Mrs. Allen 59\n58\n     Video of A.A. on December 25, 2000. Pet. Exs. 74, 81.\n59\n     The medical records of this visit do not indicate whether Mr. Allen was present.\n\n\n                                                       35\n\fexpressed concern over A.A.’s language skills, noting that she “seems to understand\n[but] sometimes refuses to talk/play games.” Pet. Ex. 9, p. 18. Mrs. Allen attributed this\nto the previous nanny, with whom she was not pleased. Id. The pediatrician advised\nMrs. Allen to follow up if concerned or not seeing progress in language development\nover the next two months. Id.\n\n       On Easter, April 15, 2001, the family visited Mr. Allen’s sister at her home, also in\nVirginia. Pet. Ex. 78 at 7. Mr. Allen remembered family members noting a “dramatic\nchange” in A.A.’s behavior from when they saw her on her birthday and at\nThanksgiving. Id. His sister, for instance, noticed that A.A. would not respond when\ncalled to by name. Id. at 8. Eventually his sister became “so concerned” about the\nchanges she saw, that she and A.A.’s mother jointly called A.A.’s pediatrician “to see if\n[she] had lost her hearing.” Id. About this time, A.A. also “began tip toe walking and\nhand flapping,” as well as humming and pacing back and forth. Id.; but see Tr. at 87\n(toe walking began “later in the year of 2001”; and the hand-flapping did not become\n“prevalent” until “around the Children’s Hospital time frame” in September). To those\nwho knew her, it was “becoming increasingly apparent that something was wrong.” Pet.\nEx. 78 at 8.\n\n       On April 24, 2001, Mr. Allen completed an application for A.A.’s admission to the\nVillage Green Day School. Tr. at 87-88. On the application, he reported that his\ndaughter did not have temper tantrums and noted no physiological, behavioral, or\ndevelopmental problems or difficulties, including in the areas of speech, hearing, and\nmobility. See Pet. Ex. 7, pp. 7-8. He did mention, however, that she had a tantrum on a\nseven-hour family trip to New York. Id. When asked to explain his responses, he\nstated: “I was a first-time parent. I didn’t see my daughter as having problems. I didn’t\nsee her as abnormal. I didn’t know if any of these behaviors were normal or abnormal.\nSo that’s probably why I wrote that.” Tr. at 90. He also noted: “At that point in time, no\ndoctor had told me that there was anything wrong with her.” 60 Tr. at 91.\n\n        In late August and early September 2001, A.A. was examined at Blue Ridge\nSpeech and Hearing for a suspected hearing problem related to her recurrent OM. The\nresultant examination report noted that A.A. had reportedly “said her first word ‘quack’ at\none year and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months, [but] stopped\nspeaking after having three ear infections in a row.” Tr. at 92 (quoting Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5).\nWhen asked if this was accurate, Mr. Allen clarified that A.A. “began to stop speaking in\nbetween each ear infection – that sentence reads as if after the three ear infections, she\nstopped speaking.” Tr. at 93. Instead, “she had three ear infections as her language\nskills were deteriorating.” Tr. at 93. The report concluded with a tentative diagnosis of\nautism. Tr. at 53; see also Pet. Ex. 78 at 8-9.\n\n\n\n60\n  This report may be technically correct in that a diagnosis of speech/language delay was not made until\nMay 2001, but it was clear from the March 1, 2001 well child visit that A.A.’s mother had concerns about\nher development, and said that she refused to talk and play games. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 18\n\n\n                                                   36\n\f        According to Mr. Allen, he and his wife were surprised by the diagnosis—in fact,\nit was the “first time” that he had heard the word “autism.” Tr. at 53. He recalled staying\nup every night, reading “about autism until 3 or 4 in the morning. During those hours,\n[A.A] would wake up screaming and the only thing that would calm her down was\nwatching cartoons with music in our bedroom.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 9; see also Tr. at 96, 98-\n100.\n\n       On September 6, 2001, petitioners consulted with Dr. Lavenstein, a neurologist\nat Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. Tr. at 55. He ordered additional testing, the\nresults of which supported the ASD diagnosis. Pet. Ex. 78 at 10. Mr. Allen then\n“applied to get [A.A.] into Kennedy Krieger through a referral” and was successful. Tr.\nat 57; Pet. Ex. 78 at 10.\n\n        Additionally, during this period A.A. underwent a bilateral tympanostomy to treat\nher recurrent OM. 61 The procedure reportedly did nothing to improve her behavior—\n“she was still not responding.” Tr. at 53. She was also taken to the Fairfax Hospital\nEmergency Department during the Christmas season in 2001 because of “one of [her]\nscreaming episodes.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 9. Testing revealed that she was “suffering from\nintestinal blockages. She was not digesting the food and it was acting like a poison in\nher body.” Pet. Ex. 78 at 9. Petitioners eventually learned that A.A. had allergies to\ndairy and eggs—a condition commonly found in children with autism. Pet. Ex. 78 at 9.\n\n       When asked to identify the time frame in which he first connected the MMR\nvaccine to A.A.’s problems, Mr. Allen reported that it “was a slow gradual process of\nkind of putting one and one together and coming up with two.” Tr. at 96. Although he\ncould not say for sure, he thought it was “probably . . . late 2001.” Tr. at 97. To assist\nhis memory during testimony, Mr. Allen was shown a January 2002 medical record,\nwhich reflected his statement that he was “100 percent sure that [A.A.]’s problems are\nfrom her MMR immunization. Her behavior started 30 days post-MMR.” Tr. at 97\n(quoting Pet. Ex. 9, p. 35). In view of the record, Mr. Allen testified: “At that time, if I\nsaid I was 100 percent certain, I meant it.” Tr. at 97.\n\n       In January 2002, petitioners were notified that A.A. would no longer be allowed to\nattend Village Green Day School due to behavioral difficulties. Tr. at 106. Mr. Allen\nrecalled that “during that time frame . . . she was having the screaming fits.” Tr. at 106.\n\n       In February 2002, petitioners met with Dr. Zimmerman for the first time. Tr. at\n57. After an extensive workup, Dr. Zimmerman validated the ASD diagnosis. Tr. at 58.\nHe then recommended that A.A. be tested for mitochondrial disorder to help guide her\ntreatment. Id. Mr. Allen remembered that the testing, which involved obtaining a blood\nspecimen, was very difficult because A.A. struggled against the procedure. Tr. at 58-\n59. After obtaining the results, Dr. Zimmerman informed petitioners that A.A. “tested\npositive for mitochondrial disorder” and referred them to Dr. Kelley for further testing\nand evaluation. Tr. at 59.\n\n\n61\n     See n.34, supra, dating the procedure as likely occurring in October 2001.\n\n                                                      37\n\f       When petitioners met with Dr. Kelley, he confirmed that A.A. had a mitochondrial\ndisorder and explained his recommended treatment was a “vitamin cocktail” that\nincluded Coenzyme Q10. Tr. at 61-62. Mr. Allen testified that after A.A. began the Dr.\nKelley’s prescribed treatment, her behavior slowly, but steadily improved. Tr. at 62-63;\nPet. Ex. 78 at 10. Although she continued to toe-walk on occasion and have difficulty in\nsocial situations, other areas were positively changed. Tr. at 63. For example, she\nbegan to make eye contact, “her voice came back,” she was better able “to\nconceptualize, particularly . . . in reading,” and her confidence increased. Tr. at 63.\n\n       As of the time of the hearing, A.A. was, according to Mr. Allen, progressing in her\ndevelopment and doing well in school. 62 Tr. at Tr. at 63-68. Although her social skills\nwere “not quite there,” she was learning to interact with her peers and had made a\nfriend at school; however, she was generally more comfortable around adults. Tr. at 63-\n64. He indicated that she still had stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, but\ntook medication to reduce these symptoms. Tr. at 65-67. She also continued to take\n“part of the cocktail.” Tr. at 65.\n\nB. Ms. Susan Edick.\n\n       Ms. Edick testified that she was employed as a special education teacher in New\nYork State. Tr. at 108. She earned a Bachelor of Science in education and special\neducation from Syracuse University and a Masters of Science in education from State\nUniversity of New York in Cortland. Pet. Ex. 79 at 1-2. She was certified in New York\nState in “Special Education for Infants to Adults, Early Childhood Education, Elementary\nEducation for Grades K-6 and Reading/Literacy Education for Grades K-12.” Pet. Ex.\n79 at 2.\n\n       According to Ms. Edick, her training included learning the signs and symptoms of\nvarious developmental disorders, including “emotional [and] learning disabilities and\nautism.” 63 Tr. at 109. Two classes in particular focused on autism, with exercises on\nhow to identify autistic behaviors and educate children with the disorder. Tr. at 109-10.\nShe also studied normal growth and development in children of school age. Tr. at 109.\n\n       In the field of education, Ms. Edick worked as a K-4 resource teacher, performed\nstudent teaching in an early education program with special needs children, and taught\nspecial education children in an integrated co-teaching classroom. Tr. at 110. Some of\nher responsibilities have included test modification, evaluation and support of student\nIndividualized Education Plans [“IEPs”], and identification and improvement of areas of\nweakness, such as “social behavioral” issues or a “learning disability in reading and\nwriting.” Tr. at 110-11. Over the course of her career, Ms. Edick has both taught\n\n62\n  Mr. Allen reported that A.A. was a “straight A” student in her program. Tr. at 64, 68. She was looking\nforward to attending high school the following year. Tr. at 68.\n63\n  It is unclear whether Ms. Edick had training and experience in identifying developmental disorders in\npre-school-age children.\n\n\n                                                    38\n\fautistic children and been responsible for identifying those with autism spectrum\ndisorder symptoms who might require intervention. Tr. at 111. She stated that in her\nwork she might, for example, identify “learning disabilities or learning patterns in kids or\nserve on the committee for the school . . . [to] recommend further testing with a\npsychologist or with speech and language therapists or with specialists, ear, nose and\nthroat, or doctors.” Tr. at 111.\n\n        Ms. Edick testified that, as a close relative, she had frequent opportunities to visit\npetitioners and observe A.A.’s growth and development. Tr. at 112; see also Pet. Ex.\n79 at 2. She also spoke often with A.A.’s mother—her sister—on the telephone. Tr. at\n112. “[W]e would discuss different activities, what was going on with them in life or\nfamily.” Tr. at 112.\n\n        Though she did not attend A.A.’s first birthday party, she remembered seeing\nA.A. when petitioners visited over the Labor Day weekend in September, when she was\nalmost 14 months old. Tr. at 112; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 2-3. According to Ms. Edick,\nA.A. seemed “very happy, very healthy” during their stay. Tr. at 113. From what she\nobserved, A.A. “seemed very normal, [with] typical development for a child socially,\ncognitively, physically. She was walking. She was talking, typical vocabulary, one-word\nvocabulary.” Tr. at 113. A.A. sometimes used gestures to communicate, such as\npointing, bouncing, or taking one by the hand. Tr. at 113, 123. However, Ms. Edick\nspecifically recalled that she could say “the words that a child would have at that time”\nand “numbers and count a little bit.” Tr. at 113. She estimated that A.A. knew\n“approximately 12 to 20 words at that time.” 64 Tr. at 123. None of A.A.’s behaviors at\nthat time concerned her. Tr. at 113, 115. “She enjoyed playing . . . peek-a-boo, playing\nso big. If you asked her how old she was, she would hold up her finger, one.” Tr. at\n113. She appeared to understand what was being said and “would look to you to\ninteract and . . . play.” Tr. at 113. Ms. Edick noted A.A.’s eye contact in the photo taken\nof her playing croquet in her yard—“she was laughing and smiling for the camera.” Tr.\nat 114 (discussing Pet. Ex. 76).\n\n       On Halloween, Ms. Edick recalled speaking to her sister on the telephone and\nasking if A.A. was dressing up to go trick-or-treating. Tr. at 116. She replied that A.A.\n“hadn’t been feeling well, she was running a fever and had been for a few days.” Tr. at\n116; see also Tr. at 123; Pet. Ex. 79 at 3. Her sister promised to “dress her up another\nday and . . . send pictures when she’s feeling better.” Tr. at 116.\n\n         On Veterans Day weekend, the Edicks visited petitioners at their home. Tr. at\n116; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 3. During that visit, she became “very concerned because .\n. . it was apparent that [A.A.] was showing signs of development[al] regression, which\nincluded . . . an absence of speech and communication . . . [and] eye contact. Tr. 116-\n\n64\n    This estimate contrasts with Mr. Allen’s testimony that A.A. knew “well over 100 words” by her first\nbirthday (Tr. at 70-72) and the earlier report that she spoke “her first word ‘Quack’ at 1 year and [spoke] a\nlittle more/using animal sounds at 15 months” (Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5). A.A.’s pediatrician assessed her as\nhaving one to three words at her one-year well child visit. Pet. Ex. 9, p. 10.\n\n\n                                                     39\n\f17; see also Tr. at 124; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 3. Her behavior was noticeably\nchanged.\n\n       She tended to just want to [lie] on the floor, or if we tried to pick her up,\n       she didn’t want us to touch her or pick her up. She would just stare at her\n       hand, stare at her bear, stare at the carpet and pick the threads in the\n       carpet. And it was quite alarming to me.\n\nTr. at 117.\n\n        And when the families visited the National Zoo, “[s]he stayed in her stroller all\nday” and showed “no interest in anything at the zoo.” Tr. at 117; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at\n3. Ms. Edick remembered that A.A. “cried a lot, whimpered” – “it was a very difficult trip\nfor her.” Tr. at 117-18; see also Tr. at 128; Pet. Ex. 79 at 4. Following the visit, Ms.\nEdick “may have said something” about her concerns to A.A.’s parents, but she did\nrecall talking to her own parents “because [she] was very concerned[,] especially since\n[A.A.] had show[n] typical development in September.” Tr. at 119; see also Tr. at 124-\n25, 130-31; Pet. Ex. 79 at 4. She stated that what she saw “really affected” her\nbecause A.A.’s “behaviors were autistic-type behaviors on the spectrum, signs of it.” Tr.\nat 119; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 4. She was not certain, though, that A.A. actually had\nautism and hoped instead that the behaviors were due to an illness. Tr. at 127, 130.\n\n        In December, Ms. Edick asked her parents to observe A.A. during their\nChristmas visit and report back on her behaviors and whether she had improved. Tr. at\n119; see also Tr. at 124-25, 130. When they returned home, they informed Ms. Edick\nthat the signs she had observed were “still apparent.” Tr. at 119. They also expressed\nthat “they were extremely upset because [A.A.] was having constant tantrums . . .\nthrowing herself back and hitting her head on the floor.” Tr. at 119; see also Pet. Ex. 79\nat 4. Because of her behaviors, they left without seeing her open any gifts. Tr. at 119.\nMs. Edick stated that she spoke with her sister after the holidays and “asked her at\ndifferent times to talk to their pediatrician, . . . or follow through with a specialist, an ear\nnose and throat person to see if there was anything wrong with [A.A.’s] hearing or\nbehavior.” Tr. at 126.\n\n        In April 2001, their families gathered together for Easter. At that time, A.A. “was\nwalking again, but . . . still did not communicate through speech or many gestures.” Tr.\nat 120; see also Tr. at 128. Ms. Edick also recalled that she “did not want to socially\ninteract with her grandparents or anyone,” or engage in any age-appropriate activities.\nTr. at 120. Also of concern was her unresponsiveness “to her name or commands” in\npotentially dangerous situations. Tr. at 120; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 5. She observed\nA.A. to “just run randomly” into the woods or a nearby yard and that she did “not\nrespond to her name or commands.” Tr. at 120; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 5. According to\nMs. Edick, this was different from her previous behavior. Previously A.A. “always\nresponded and stayed around people”—[i]f you called her, she would come to you.” Tr.\nat 120.\n\n\n\n                                               40\n\f        In the summer of 2001, the Edicks visited petitioners. During their stay, she\nnoted that some of the abnormal behaviors were persisting—“she still did not\ncommunicate, she still was not talking,” and she still did not “have a lot of eye contact.”\nTr. at 121; see also Pet. Ex. 79 at 5. She also remembered that A.A. “was having a lot\nof crying and tantrums[,] . . . did not want to keep her clothes on[,]” and appeared to be\n“experiencing some . . . sensory issues[.]” Tr. at 121-22.\n\n       Ms. Edick indicated that she was not surprised when A.A. was evaluated on the\nautism spectrum, as she eventually suspected—and suggested—that autism was a\npossibility. Tr. at 122, 133-34. By that point, petitioners also did not seem too\nsurprised, either. Tr. at 133. Although it was “very devastating” to accept, they had\nbeen seeking answers for some time—“it was such a bad period of time for them.” Tr.\nat 133.\n\n                                       V. Expert Qualifications.\n\n         Four physicians offered opinions on vaccine causation and other matters in\ndispute. All of the experts were well-qualified to offer opinions in this case. Petitioners’\nexperts opined that A.A. had an underlying mitochondrial disorder that made her\nvulnerable to the inflammatory effects of the MMR vaccine she received at her 15-\nmonth well child visit. As a result of her vaccination, she experienced a rapid regression\nand ultimately developed “mitochondrial autism.” Respondent’s experts opined that\nA.A. did not have a mitochondrial abnormality or suffer a rapid regression. Instead, she\nexhibited signs of autism prior to vaccination and followed a typical course thereafter. In\ntheir view, the MMR vaccine did not aggravate an underlying condition or cause her to\ndevelop ASD.\n\nA. Petitioners’ Experts.\n\n        Petitioners presented testimony from two experts: Dr. Andrew W. Zimmerman,\nan expert in pediatric neurology, and Dr. Richard I. Kelley, an expert in metabolism.\nBoth physicians were involved in A.A.’s treatment and were familiar with her general\nmedical history and development; however, neither was a treater at the time of\nvaccination or a contemporaneous witness to the onset of her condition. As such, these\nparticular treating physicians are no more knowledgeable about what actually transpired\nafter the vaccination than any other physician who testified in this case.\n\n          1. Andrew W. Zimmerman, M.D. 65\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman earned his medical degree from Columbia University. Tr. at\n289. He completed a pediatric internship at the University of Michigan, and a neurology\nresidency at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Tr. at 289-90. Following his residency, Dr.\n\n\n\n65\n     Doctor Zimmerman’s CV was filed as Pet. Ex. 26, and his expert report was filed as Pet.

He is board certified in pediatrics and\npediatric neurology. Id. He has published over 70 peer-reviewed articles—many\nfocused on autism. Id.; see also Pet. Ex. 26 at 16-22. Doctor Zimmerman works with\nvarious hospital committees in his capacity at the Lurie Center and serves as the\nscientific advisory chair on the board of directors of the Fetal Physiology Foundation.\nTr. at 291; Pet. Ex. 26 at 3.\n\n           2. Richard I. Kelley, M.D., Ph.D. 67\n\n       Doctor Kelly earned his medical degree and a Ph.D. in pathology/molecular\nbiology from the University of Pennsylvania, where he participated in a combined\nPh.D./M.D. program. Tr. at 135; Pet. Ex. 24 at 1. He completed a residency in\npediatrics and a postdoctoral fellowship in medical genetics at The Children’s Hospital\nof Philadelphia [“CHOP”], after which he spent approximately five years on the CHOP\nfaculty in the departments of metabolism and genetics. Tr. at 135-36; Pet. Ex. 24 at 1.\nSubsequently, he joined the faculty of the department of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine [“JHU”] and also became a staff physician at the Kennedy\nKrieger Institute [“KKI”]. Id. Both institutions are located in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n        Doctor Kelley is currently a professor of pediatrics at JHU and director of the\ndivision of metabolism at KKI. Tr. at 136; Pet. Ex. 24 at 1. In addition to an active\nclinical practice, he oversees several KKI laboratories that conduct biochemical and\ngenetic testing. Tr. at 136-37. He is also “the principal advisor for the neurology\ndivision” and a coordinator for the “neurogenetics division.” Tr. at 137. His academic\nresponsibilities include teaching medical residents, “mostly . . . on an individual basis,”\nand performing “consultations . . . when a question falls into [his] areas of expertise.” Id.\n\n       He is board certified in pediatrics, clinical genetics, biochemical genetics, and\ncytogenetics. Tr. at 138; Pet. Ex. 24 at 13. Doctor Kelley stated that he is regularly\nconsulted as a mitochondrial expert both domestically and internationally. Tr. at 139-40.\nHe is “the go-to person” for certain developmental diseases and has been consulted on\n\n\n66\n  Doctor Zimmerman testified that he was on the faculty for eight years; however, his resume indicated\nthat it was between six and seven years (January 1977 to August 1983). Pet. Ex. 26 at 1-2.\n67\n     Doctor Kelley’s CV was filed as Pet. Ex. 24, and his expert report was filed as Pet. Ex. 23.\n\n\n                                                       42\n\fa number of “puzzling case[s]” involving “Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Barth syndrome,\nmitochondrial disease, chondrodysplasia punctata, [and] Zellweger syndrome.” Id.\n\n       His publications include more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific articles and 12\nbook chapters. Pet. Ex. 24 at 2-11. He has written about “a fairly broad spectrum of\nmetabolic abnormalities that largely come from clinical practice.” Tr. at 138. His work\nhas “been largely with metabolic and so-called inborn errors of metabolism;” however,\nthe focus of his research “basically depends on what comes up in the clinic or . . . our\nlaboratory” at any given time. Id.\n\n       Doctor Kelley previously served on numerous committees and boards, including\njournal review boards. Pet. Ex. 24 at 13-14. However, he resigned or withdrew from\nthem beginning around 2006, when demands on his time increased. Tr. at 141.\n\nB. Respondent’s Experts.\n\n       Respondent presented testimony from two experts: Dr. Max Wiznitzer, an expert\nin pediatric neurology and developmental disabilities, and Dr. Stephen Cederbaum, an\nexpert in pediatrics, inborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disease, and\ngenetics.\n\n          1. Max Wiznitzer, M.D. 68\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer earned his medical degree from Northwestern University, and\ncompleted a pediatrics residency at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Tr. at 476. He\nalso completed fellowships in development disorders at the Cincinnati Center for\nDevelopmental Disorders and in child neurology at the University of Pennsylvania\nSystem and at the Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia. Id. Additionally, he completed a\nNational Institutes of Health National Research Service Award Fellowship in disorders\nof higher cortical function in children at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New\nYork. Id.\n\n        Since 1986, Dr. Wiznitzer has been a full-time staff neurologist at Rainbow\nBabies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Tr. at 477. In his capacity, Dr.\nWiznitzer has treated “thousands of children and . . . adults” with autism. Tr. at 482. He\nhas “an extremely busy clinical practice” that provides him the opportunity to “see\npatients four to five half-days a week.” Tr. at 480. He routinely reads EEGs, assists the\nepilepsy team when a member is out of town, and works “at least eight weeks in the\nyear on the inpatient medical service,” where he is responsible for “any children\nadmitted to the neurology service” and provides consults on any neurology questions.\nTr. at 480-81.\n\n       Additionally, Dr. Wiznitzer is a professor of pediatrics and neurology and\ninternational health at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Tr. at 477.\n\n68\n     Doctor Wiznitzer’s CV was filed as Res. Ex. L, and his expert report was filed as Res. Ex. K.\n\n\n                                                       43\n\fHe has conducted research in a variety of areas, with a special interest in autism, which\nhe began studying in 1986. Tr. at 481. As a researcher, he has been involved in “two\nseminal studies looking at the differentiation between autism, kids with developmental\nlanguage disorder, and children [with] mental retardation.” Id. Most recently, he\nparticipated in a study with high-functioning autistic children that sought “to alter the[ir]\ndevelopmental trajectory” through “a pharmacologic intervention.” Tr. at 481-82.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer is board certified in pediatrics, neurodevelopmental disabilities,\nand neurology, with special qualification in child neurology. Tr. at 477. He has\npublished 60 peer-reviewed articles, 11 book chapters, and numerous abstracts. Res.\nEx. L at 13-23. He also writes questions for the neurodevelopmental disability board\ncertification exam. Tr. at 483. Doctor Wiznitzer regularly lectures on autism spectrum\ndisorders and developmental disabilities at national and international meetings. Tr. at\n482. He is a member of numerous professional organizations, editorial boards, and\nadvisory groups. Tr. at 477-80.\n\n          2. Stephen D. Cederbaum, M.D. 69\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum earned his medical degree from New York University School\nof Medicine, and completed an internship and residency at Washington University\nSchool of Medicine in St. Louis. Tr. at 376. Subsequently he worked for the National\nInstitutes of Health, fulfilling his military service obligation, where he conducted\nbiochemical research. Id. He then returned to Washington University for training in\nmedical genetics, after which he accepted a position at the University of California at\nLos Angeles [“UCLA”]. Id. At UCLA, Dr. Cederbaum taught medical students, cared for\npatients with genetic disorders (particularly those with inborn errors of metabolism), and\nconducted basic scientific research, with a focus on urea cycle disorders and inborn\nerrors. Tr. at 377-78.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum is board certified in clinical genetics and biochemical\ngenetics. Tr. at 378. He has published 150 peer-reviewed articles and 80 to 90\nchapters and other contributions. Tr. at 379. Although he has not published extensively\nin the field of mitochondrial disease, he considered himself a “pioneer” on the subject\ndue to his publication of “one of the first cases of mitochondrial disorders” in the 1970s.\nId. He also “was a pioneer in the area of pyruvate hydrogenase deficiency, developing\nthe first dietary therapy for it.” Id. He has also lectured on mitochondrial disease\nnationally and internationally. Tr. at 381.\n\n      He is currently a professor emeritus at UCLA, which has allowed him to continue\nmany of his previous pursuits, but at a reduced level of responsibility. Tr. at 377. He\nremains current with developments, research, and literature in the field of inborn errors\nof metabolism, and is a reviewer for a variety of journals. Tr. at 377, 379-80. Doctor\nCederbaum has received notable honors and awards and remains a member of several\n\n\n69\n     Doctor Cederbaum’s CV was filed as Res. Ex. B, and his expert report was filed as Res. Ex.

Tr. at 380.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum also works as a medical monitor for the mitochondrial\nresearch program at Columbia University. Tr. at 380. He previously worked in that\ncapacity for the University of Florida. Id. Doctor Cederbaum explained that a medical\nmonitor acts as an unbiased evaluator when questions arise about the safety of\nparticipants involved in research studies. Id.\n\n                                   VI. Causation Evidence.\n\nA. Medical Literature.\n\n      The volume of medical literature submitted into the record renders a separate\nsummary of each article impractical. Although I read and considered every piece of\nmedical literature in the record, only the articles addressed by the experts or that I relied\nupon in coming to my conclusion will be specifically referenced below.\n\nB. Expert Opinion and Testimony.\n\n       1. Doctor Zimmerman.\n\n       In his expert report, submitted prior to hearing, Dr. Zimmerman recounted that\nA.A. “had normal development until 16 months when she regressed in language and\nsocial skills within 1 – 2 weeks following immunization with MMR vaccine.” Pet. Ex. 25\nat 1. Based on her history, his evaluation and testing, and her response to treatment,\nDr. Zimmerman concluded that A.A. “had a disorder of mitochondrial metabolism\nassociated with autistic regression.” Id. at 2. The report, however, contained no\nstatement addressing the role of the MMR vaccine in the development of this condition.\n\n         Doctor Zimmerman began his direct testimony at hearing with a review of A.A.’s\nmedical history and his involvement in her treatment. He first saw A.A. at an initial\nevaluation on February 13, 2002, when she was 30 months of age. He recalled that\nshe presented with “a history of autism following regression.” Tr. at 292. Based on\nparental report, she regressed “one to two weeks following her MMR immunization” with\na “los[s of] language and eye contact and social interaction.” Id. He stated that her\nearly development “appeared to be normal” from “all standpoints”—she “had met all her\nmilestones.” Tr. at 292-93. Because of her history and presentation, Dr. Zimmerman\n“initiated a workup of genetic and metabolic studies.” Id. 70\n\n\n70\n   In his evaluation, Dr. Zimmerman wrote that A.A. “presents an atypical history and appearance\nconsistent with an encephalopathy and a pervasive developmental disorder (autism spectrum). A history\nof regressive encephalopathy suggests the need for genetic testing, chromosomes and DNA for fragile X\nand quantitative plasma amino acids and urine organic acids.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24. He also “requested\ngenetic testing to rule out Rett syndrome.” Id.\n\n\n                                                 45\n\f       In response to questioning on cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman stated that the\nhistory he gave of A.A.’s regression in language and social skills shortly after her MMR\nimmunization was based entirely on statements from her parents. Tr. at 347-48. He\nalso indicated that prior to her initial evaluation he had not reviewed any of her medical\nrecords, although he has since done so. 71 Id. When asked whether he found any\nindication in the medical records of developmental abnormalities or changed behavior\nwithin one to two weeks of her immunization, he stated “I don’t believe so, no.” Tr. at\n348.\n\n        During his testimony, Dr. Zimmerman viewed and commented on several\nsegments of home video taken on October 14, 2000, about nine days before A.A.’s\nimmunization. Petitioners argued that the video provides a demonstrative baseline for\nher pre-vaccination behavior and developmental achievement. In the video, which was\ntaken at petitioners’ home, A.A. seemed “quite lively.” Tr. at 294. She appeared to\nrespond to her name and play appropriately with toys, and said “quack” when asked\nwhat noise a duck makes. Tr. at 294-95. When questioned about her age, she\nindicated with a raised finger that she was one year old. Doctor Zimmerman assessed\nthis behavior as appropriate for A.A.’s age. Tr. at 295. He also observed that in an\nearlier frame she was “pointing with [her] index finger”—an “important prelinguistic\ngesture that children develop around one year of age[.]” Tr. at 295-96.\n\n       He further noted that A.A. was appropriately interactive with her parents. Tr. at\n296. “She’s smiling and responsive and looking at the camera. I think she’s actually\nmaking eye contact with the person who’s taking the film.” Tr. at 297. As for her\nlanguage development, she was “not forming words,” but “making word sounds.” Tr. at\n297. This was not a point of concern, but instead, evidence that “she’s developing\nlanguage.” Tr. at 297. For example, when she said “moo” in response to the question\n“What does a cow say?”, she was not simply repeating a sound someone made to her,\nbut responding to a question. Tr. at 298. “She’s practicing to be two.” Tr. at 298.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman stated that a 15-month-old child would\ntypically have three words with meaning. Tr. at 343. When asked whether he heard\nA.A. say any words in the above-described video clip, he stated: “I guess the ‘quack,’\nand at one point she said ‘moo.’” Tr. at 344. He also recalled her “babbling some word\nsounds,” but no other specific words. Id. When pressed whether he believed “moo”\nand “quack” were words rather than sounds, he stated that “moo” was a word in this\ncontext because A.A.’s response “was prompted only by the question, not by the\nsound.” 72 Tr. at 344.\n\n71\n   I directed Dr. Zimmerman to consider the initial audiological evaluation of A.A. from Blue Ridge Speech\n& Hearing, which states: “Speech and language landmarks were reported as age-appropriate to a point,\nsaid first word at one year, spoke a little more at 15 months, stopped speaking after having three ear\ninfections in a row.” Tr. at 368 (quoting Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5). I asked him whether he still would have\nattributed A.A.’s regression to her MMR vaccination had he seen that record or been provided that history\nby her parents. Tr. at 368. He responded: “I would have taken this into consideration, yes.” Id.\n72\n   On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman confirmed that “moo” is a legitimate word. He stated that the 1983 edition\nof Webster’s Dictionary “clearly says it’s a verb, to make the characteristic sound of a cow. So, she had a\n\n                                                    46\n\f       He was also questioned about his comment that A.A. appeared to be making eye\ncontact with the person taking the video. Tr. at 344-45. When asked whether he could\ndifferentiate between her “interacting or making eye contact with the person,” and her\nsimply “looking at the camera,” he conceded that he could not know what she was\nlooking at. Tr. at 345.\n\n        In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman confirmed that he saw A.A.\npointing on the video, but that he did not see any evidence of her using words, “except\n[for] what we have said, the – saying ‘moo’ and ‘quack’.” Tr. at 358. As for her raising a\nfinger to show her age, he agreed that the action was not an indication that she knew\nher numbers, but that she had been “keyed or trained or talked to about putting that\nfinger up.” Tr. at 358; see also Tr. at 683-84. He also indicated that her reported ability\nto name colors was probably overstated based on the level of development he saw on\nthe video. Tr. at 358-59 (citing Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15 (reporting that prior to her regression\n“she knew her colors and was using words and was pointing”)). 73 “It would be a little\nadvanced, actually.” Tr. at 359.\n\n       In a later segment of the video, A.A. demonstrated normal gross motor skills by\nrunning around the house. Tr. at 295. Doctor Zimmerman commented that “[s]he has\nquite a good running gait for a child of that age.” Tr. at 298. He also noted that she\nstood “without difficulty” and was “quite independent.” Tr. at 298. In another clip, she\nwas seen actively exploring her surroundings, responding to the word “no”, and feeding\nherself—behaviors he judged as age-appropriate. Tr. at 299. When the video\nconcluded, Dr. Zimmerman stated that A.A. “appear[ed] normal in . . . all respects.” Tr.\nat 299.\n\n        On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman was asked to elaborate on the development that he\nsaw during the October 14 video which he considered to be normal. Tr. at 674. He\nstated that overall he “thought the language, the social interaction and her movements\nwere normal. Her activities . . . were appropriate for age.” Tr. at 674-75. It is unclear\nwhy he considered her language to be normal and age appropriate. He previously\ntestified that a 15-month old child would have three words with meaning, but\ncharacterized A.A.’s speech, as seen in the video, as “babbling” and stated that she\nwas not forming words. See Tr. at 297, 344.\n\n\n\nword.” Tr. at 677; see also Tr. at 680 (recross). He emphasized that it is a “meaningful” word “which is\nrecognized.” Tr. at 677. I conclude that “moo” was not a word that A.A. used to communicate; rather, it\nwas a response to “what does the cow say,” just as holding up her index finger was a trained response to\na question about her age.\n73\n   See also Tr. at 33 (Mr. Allen stating that A.A. “understood the colors” of the croquet balls when she\nplayed the game over the Labor Day holiday in September 2000). I have no difficulty accepting that she\nunderstood that the balls were of different colors, and that one particular colored ball was “hers,” but that\nis a far cry from knowing colors and labeling items with their color when asked to do so—a more common\nmeaning for “knowing her colors.”\n\n\n                                                     47\n\f         Doctor Zimmerman also was asked to specifically comment on what he\nconsidered to be developmentally normal in A.A.’s behavior at the pumpkin patch that\nsame day. Tr. at 675. In response, he identified her interest in the pumpkins and her\nability to stoop and recover when playing with them. Id. She had a good running gait\nand was stable when walking. Id. He noted “a lot of facial expression” and “some\nreciprocal interaction with her parents.” Id. He further noted that he did not perceive\nany difference in her behavior at the pumpkin patch from the earlier scenes when she\nwas alone with her parents at home. Id.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman was asked to review the medical record of A.A.’s 15-month\nwell child visit, which occurred on October 23, 2000. 74 Tr. at 300. He stated that the\nrecord reflected “normal” development on all measured criteria. Tr. at 301. It also\nindicated that she received three vaccinations on that occasion: “MMR number one, Hib\nbooster, and Hep-B.” Tr. at 301.\n\n       Petitioners played several segments of home video taken on October 29, 2000,\nsix days after A.A.’s immunization. Petitioners argued that the video shows marked\nchanges in A.A.’s behavior. The video captured various moments during the pre-\nHalloween party that took place outdoors in petitioners’ neighborhood.\n\n       After viewing the video, Dr. Zimmerman observed that A.A. seemed “less lively,”\nhad “virtually no facial expression,” and looked as though she did not “feel well.” Tr. at\n301; see also Tr. at 678 (redirect). He also noted that she did not look at the camera or\ninteract with her parents. Id. And although she walked at times, it seemed “stilted.” Tr.\nat. 301; see also Tr. at 682 (recross). During one clip, A.A. is seen walking with her\nparents but was “not showing much expression on her own and [didn’t] seem to be [as]\ninterested in things, as she was before.” Tr. at 302; see also Tr. at 677-78 (redirect);\n682 (recross). In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman reiterated that he\nthought A.A.’s “motor activity was diminished” and that she had less facial emotion as\ncompared to her behavior on October 14. Tr. at 684-85.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman indicated that the behavioral changes seen in the video\ncorrelated with the parental report that A.A. changed “within one to two weeks of the\nMMR immunization.” Tr. at 302-03.\n\n         I asked Dr. Zimmerman whether the October 23 well child record reflected\nsymptoms of an illness or a cold. Tr. at 353-54. He responded that it noted ear tugging,\nnasal congestion for one week, and treatment with the antibiotic amoxicillin. Tr. at 354.\nHe confirmed that treatment with amoxicillin was indicative of an ear infection. Id. I\nthen recalled his statement that A.A. appeared ill in the October 29th video and asked\nwhether her behavior could have been the result of the illness reflected in the medical\nrecord. Id. He stated that he “would expect if the amoxicillin were treating an ear\ninfection, that she would have felt better by . . . six days later.” Id. He agreed, however,\nthat if the infection was viral rather than bacterial, she might have still felt ill. Id.\n\n74\n     Pet. Ex. 9, p. 9.\n\n\n                                            48\n\f        I also asked Dr. Zimmerman about differences between the videos with regard to\nenvironment. Tr. at 355. He noted that the first video was taken at home, while the\nsecond was shot “outside in a party atmosphere.” Id. He acknowledged that “they\n[we]ren’t directly comparable” and discussed the impact that environment can have on a\nchild’s behavior. Tr. at 355-56. For example, if she were really shy, she might not feel\ncomfortable participating in the activities. He stated, though, that he “would have\nexpected her to be more reactive to her parents . . . and have more expression.” Tr. at\n356. Overall, however, he did not think the environment was a factor. Tr. at 679\n(redirect).\n\n        Petitioners showed home video taken on Christmas Day 2000. Doctor\nZimmerman observed that “[t]his [was] two months later, the opening [of] presents, and\nshe doesn’t show, again, interaction with the parents or . . . the toys. Tr. at 303. She\nalso was “not vocalizing like she was initially” and “show[ed] very little facial expression,\nif any[.]” Tr. at 303.\n\n      Doctor Zimmerman was then asked to opine on the significance of the behavioral\nchanges seen in the videos. Specifically, were they due to a transitory illness or\npossibly the result of her vaccination? He stated that, in his view, the post-vaccination\nvideos indicated that her changes were not due to a temporary sickness, because she\nwould have improved by Christmas. Tr. at 303. Instead, “her condition five days after\nthe doctor’s visit appeared to persist . . . two months later.” Tr. at 303-04.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman was asked whether he had seen any\nvideo of A.A. taken during the two-month period between October 29th and December\n25th, or reviewed any medical records from that same period. Tr. at 346. He stated\nthat apart from petitioners’ affidavits, he had not seen any contemporaneous evidence.\nTr. at 346.\n\n        Doctor Zimmerman next discussed his initial evaluation of A.A. on February 13,\n2002. See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 23. In his report he noted that “[s]he was fussy and showed\nmany features of autism; she didn’t engage or sustain eye contact; she had word\nsounds . . . and would seek her parents’ attention at times[.]” Tr. at 304. She was\nreluctant to engage in “ball-play” and demonstrated “mild instability in her truncal gait.”\nTr. at 305. He stated that her history and physical presentation—specifically, her “lack\nof language [and] eye contact, and repetitive behaviors,” as well as her lack of\nreciprocation—led him to conclude that she “had an autism spectrum disorder.” Tr. at\n305.\n\n      Following his diagnosis, he ordered genetic and metabolic testing in an effort to\ndiscover the cause of her condition. Tr. at 305. The genetic test results were normal;\nhowever, several lab studies “showed . . . differences in her amino acids and liver\nenzymes, such as AST [aspartate transaminase] and ALT [alanine transaminase] and\nCK [creatine kinase].” Tr. at 306.\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\f        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman was asked to elaborate on his statement\nin his initial evaluation that A.A. “presents an atypical history and appearance consistent\nwith an encephalopathy and a pervasive developmental disorder, autism spectrum.” Tr.\nat 348 (citing Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24). In response to questioning, he clarified that what he\nwas “really saying” was that she had “atypical development.” Tr. at 348. He stated that\nhe was trying to express that “[r]egression is not typical development.” Tr. at 348. He\nalso found the “rapidity of her regression to be striking.” Tr. at 349. It was “somewhat\nunusual\" and not characteristic of those seen in the general autism spectrum disorder\npopulation. Tr. at 349.\n\n       I questioned Dr. Zimmerman regarding the asserted rapidity of A.A.’s regression.\nSpecifically, I asked him to consider the time period between the October 14 (pre-\nvaccination) video and the December 25 (post-vaccination) video, without regard to the\nOctober 29 video, and state whether he would still consider the behavioral changes to\nbe rapid. Tr. at 353. He responded: “Three months would not be rapid, no.” Tr. at 353.\n\n        A.A. was next seen by Dr. Zimmerman on July 15, 2002. Doctor Zimmerman\nreviewed the follow-up note he wrote after that visit. 75 He stated that he “wanted to get\nfurther testing and recommended the organic acids” and other tests because he\nsuspected “that she might have mitochondrial problems.” Tr. at 306-07. The basis for\nthis belief was A.A.’s “apparently rapid deterioration following her MMR vaccine”—a\npattern he had seen in other children with mitochondrial problems. Tr. at 307. He\nstated that he has “seen about 20 [children] over the years who have had this pattern\nand . . . then show up with elevated CK, AST, and alanine.” Tr. at 307. He noted that\n“most” of the cases “were in conjunction with Dr. Kelley,” but that he had “seen them\nseparately from consultation with him.” Tr. at 307. Doctor Zimmerman confirmed that\nhe ordered additional testing, including “lactic acid, serum chemistries, liver functions,\n[and] CK – CPK [creatine phosphokinase].” Tr. at 308.\n\n       A neurology clinic follow-up note from A.A.’s next visit, on November 4, 2002,\nreflected the results of her laboratory testing. 76 Doctor Zimmerman recounted that “her\nlactate was slightly elevated, but CK was elevated, as was her AST.” Tr. at 309. With\nregard to her elevated lactate, he explained that any struggling during the procedure\nwould likely have affected the results. 77 In view of this, Dr. Zimmerman repeated some\nof the studies, the results of which were listed at the bottom of the record. Of particular\ninterest were her elevated CK and AST levels. Tr. at 309. These outcomes led Dr.\nZimmerman to assume that A.A. “might have mitochondrial dysfunction” and to “start[]\nher on levocarnitine [L-carnitine] or Carnitor.” Tr. at 310.\n\n\n\n75\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n76\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19.\n77\n  He also stated that “her potassium [was] also slightly elevated, which could be for a number of reasons,\nbut it [struggling] could have also played into that.” Tr. at 309.\n\n\n                                                   50\n\f        On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman explained that he did not order a repeat\ntest of A.A.’s plasma lactate because lactate testing is often unreliable as a measure.\nTr. at 350. He stated that “unless you’re there when the lactate is drawn and know . . .\nexactly how it was drawn, it’s hard to say if it’s normal or not.” Tr. at 350. As a result,\nhe “usually [doesn’t] rely on lactates very much[.]” Tr. at 350.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman elaborated that he had seen the elevated biochemistries—\nspecifically, the elevated CK and AST—in other patients with symptoms similar to A.A.’s\nand suspected that she had mitochondrial dysfunction. 78 Tr. at 310. In the past he had\nseen approximately 10 to 12 patients with such profiles and treated many of them “in a\nsimilar fashion.” Tr. at 311. That is, he “start[ed] with carnitine, then [obtained] further\nstudies, and then [progressed to] using a more complete mitochondrial cocktail of\nvitamins.” Tr. at 311. Doctor Zimmerman stated that most of the patients, “in various\ndegrees,” had a positive response to the treatment. Tr. at 311.\n\n        When Dr. Zimmerman next saw A.A., it was at an unscheduled urgent visit on\nJanuary 22, 2003. 79 Tr. at 312. He recalled that “she had had four generalized tonic-\nclonic seizures over the . . . previous several weeks, since starting on the carnitine.” Tr.\nat 312. He suspected that “the seizures were stimulated by the carnitine, but [also]\nassumed that she probably had an underlying predisposition to have seizures because\nof autism.” Tr. at 312. Doctor Zimmerman asked A.A.’s parents “to discontinue the\ncarnitine” and bring her in for a visit. Tr. at 312. His plan following examination was to\nstart A.A. on Depakote and order a repeat EEG after six weeks. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15. He\nalso made a referral to Dr. Kelley “for further evaluation of a metabolic disorder. Tr. at\n313.\n\n        A.A. returned for a follow-up with Dr. Zimmerman on March 3, 2003, at which\ntime she appeared to be doing well. 80 Tr. at 313. Although the Depakote “seemed to\ninduce irritability,” she had only one additional seizure, which occurred after “she had\nbeen sleep-deprived.” Tr. at 314. As for her biochemistries, she had “elevated alanine\nto lysine ratio on an earlier study, normal on repeat; AST and CK were both elevated on\ntwo occasions; and the genetic testing was normal.” Tr. at 314. At this time, A.A. had\nnot yet seen Dr. Kelley, so Dr. Zimmerman discussed her case with him and asked that\nhe see her earlier due to his “concern about mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at 314.\n\n        On April 8, 2003, Dr. Kelley saw A.A. for an initial consultation at his metabolism\nclinic. Doctor Zimmerman was asked to review Dr. Kelley’s consultation report. 81 In\nresponse to questioning, Dr. Zimmerman stated that the report showed Dr. Kelley\n\n78\n  Doctor Zimmerman stated that he was referring particularly to the child discussed in the Poling article.\nSee Poling, Pet. Ex. 25A.\n79\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 15.\n80\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 13.\n81\n     Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 3-7.\n\n\n                                                    51\n\f“found that [A.A.] had mitochondrial involvement and recommended . . . treatment with a\nvitamin regimen”—a “mitochondrial cocktail.”82 Tr. at 315. She was also restarted on\nCarnitor (L-carnitine), but at a lower dosage. Tr. at 315. Doctor Zimmerman explained\nthat L-carnitine “increases Complex I activity” and the various other vitamins “increase[]\nelectron transport chain activity.” Tr. at 315.\n\n       In response to questions regarding the cocktail, Dr. Zimmerman stated that he\nhas ordered the mitochondrial cocktail in his practice with the expectation that he would\n“see considerable improvement in the . . . child’s functioning.” Tr. at 317. He would\nspecifically watch for “[i]mproved developmental milestones and activity.” He recalled\nthat he was “concerned about the carnitine” in A.A.’s particular case, “but starting her\nback . . . did not seem to cause problems[;] . . . she responded rather well.” Tr. at 317.\n\n       A.A. returned for a follow-up with Dr. Zimmerman on July 14, 2003, a few days\nshy of her fourth birthday. 83 He characterized her as “doing remarkably well.” Tr. at\n318. He recalled that she had “responded to the cocktail, the parents were pleased,\nand she was sustaining eye contact; was more interactive, though briefly; seemed to\nplay with imagination . . . ; and was using single words, word combination[s]. Tr. at 318;\nsee also Tr. at 373-74 (redirect). She also had improved sleep. Tr. at 318. With regard\nto her seizures, he noted that he “had switched her medication from Depakote to\nTegretol based on the fact that Depakote seemed to be activating her in a negative way,\nand I felt she would respond better to Tegretol at that point, since her seizures were\ncontrolled.” Tr. at 318.\n\n       In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman explained that Depakote and\nTegretol both have side effects, which vary by individual; however, based on his own\nexperience, Depakote seems to cause “activation”—screaming, irritability. Tr. at 359.\nTegretol, on the other hand, “will often have a calming effect on adverse behaviors.” Tr.\nat 360. Doctor Zimmerman stated that in A.A.’s case he “assume[d the improvement]\nwas due to the Tegretol or at least withdrawing . . . the Depakote.” Tr. at 360.\n\n      Doctor Zimmerman stated that he continued to evaluate A.A. and that she\nprogressively “improve[d] over the years.” Tr. at 319. In his opinion, her positive\nresponse to the vitamin cocktail was “an indication” that A.A. “more likely than not” had\n“an underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at 319. With regard to her seizures, the\nmedication was effective in preventing any further occurrences, and after two years A.A.\ndiscontinued the anti-seizure treatment without recurrence. Tr. at 319-20.\n\n        In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman stated that his experience and\nexpectations with regard to the effects of vitamin cocktails were personal and anecdotal.\nTr. at 356. He was not aware of any studies that have systematically looked at whether\n\n82\n  The vitamin cocktail was composed of coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, vitamin C, thiamine, and lipoic acid.\nPet. Ex. 6, p 7.\n83\n     Pet. Ex. 6, p. 1.\n\n\n                                                  52\n\fvitamin cocktails are an effective treatment for children with autism. Tr. at 356. He also\nacknowledged that most children with ASD diagnoses make some improvements over\ntime, especially with proven therapies, such as speech therapy and ABA therapy, both\nof which A.A. received. Tr. at 356-57.\n\n       At this juncture, Dr. Zimmerman’s testimony shifted to a discussion of his\nresearch and the connections he and others have made between mitochondrial\ndysfunction and autism. 84 Tr. at 320. Although he spoke knowledgeably in both these\nareas, he was unable to set forth a theory connecting vaccines to either mitochondrial\ndysfunction or autism. Indeed, he testified that he could not directly attribute autistic\nregression to the MMR immunization or any resulting inflammation. Tr. at 367.\n\n      His early research “revolved around neuroinflammation and microglial activation\nand basically immune studies in autism, looking for factors in the immune system that\nmight be involved in . . . autism.” Tr. at 320. He stated that there is indication that\ninflammation plays a role in the “autism process,” but the work in this area has produced\nfew definitive answers. Tr. at 320. It cannot be said “that in any one individual . . .\ninflammation is the cause of autism.” 85 Tr. at 321.\n\n       Regarding mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of autism, Dr. Zimmerman\nstated that he had “always considered [it a] possibility,” but that it was not until he “went\nto Kennedy Krieger” and began working with Dr. Kelley that his interest solidified. Tr. at\n321. He explained that “mitochondria have always been considered an important part\nof neurological disorders,” but unlike “known” mitochondrial diseases, such as “Kearns-\nSayre syndrome or MERRF 86 or MNGIE,” 87 which are degenerative conditions,\nmitochondrial involvement in autism appears to impact development. Tr. at 321-22. He\ncontinued:\n\n84\n  On cross examination, Dr. Zimmerman clarified that he is not a geneticist, metabolic specialist, or\nexpert in mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 343.\n85\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Zimmerman confirmed his opinion that inflammation is thought to\nplay a role in autism, but cannot be said to be its cause in any one individual. Tr. at 360. He explained\nthat his assertion was based on the findings of “microglial activation in all the postmortem samples”\nregardless of whether there was regression. Tr. at 360. Doctor Zimmerman was the coauthor of two\npapers on this topic: D. Vargas, et al., Neuroglial Activation and Neuroinflammation in the Brain of\nPatients with Autism, ANNALS NEUROL. 57(1): 67-81 (2005); D. Vargas, et al., Immunity, neuroglia and\nneuroinflammation in autism, INT’L REV. PSYCHIAT. 17(6): 485-95 (2005). Although these papers were not\nfiled in this case, they were extensively discussed in the OAP test cases. See, e.g., Snyder. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">332044</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *88. In summary, the papers demonstrated microglial activation, but indicated that it might be\nthe result of ASD, not the cause.\n86\n  MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers) syndrome is “a familial type of mitochondrial\nencephalopathy of maternal (mitochondrial) inheritance, characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and\nmitochondrial myopathy with ragged red fibers.” The syndrome “is usually caused by mutation within the\nmitochondrial gene encoding the tRNA specific for lysine.” DORLAND’S at 1838.\n87\n  MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy) is one of numerous encephalopathies\nassociated with mitochondrial abnormalities. DORLAND’S at 615.\n\n\n                                                    53\n\f        [ASD] is not a degenerative disease in the vast majority of patients. It is\n        not something that gets worse with age, although some patients don’t\n        progress. If they regress, [it] occurs before the age of three, and [is]\n        usually associated with this window of vulnerability[.] . . . [R]egressions\n        typically occur between 15 and 24 months of age when there are profound\n        changes in synaptic development taking place in the developing brain.\n\nTr. at 322.\n\n         He stated that researchers are coming to understand that “autism is a problem at\nthe synaptic level.” Tr. at 323. Although a number of brain regions are involved in\nautism, “the real problem is at the level of the connections, at the synapses,” which are\never-changing during development. Tr. at 323. He explained that unregulated synaptic\npruning during the early stages of brain growth is a likely cause of the regressions seen\nin some individuals during this period. Tr. at 322. The research in this area is unclear,\nthough, as to “whether it’s too much or too little” pruning, or something else that has\n“go[ne] awry.” Tr. at 322. Some researchers theorize an acceleration or “exaggeration”\nof the normal pruning process due to “inflammation, probably from many different\ncauses.” Tr. at 323. He noted that “relatively few” causes of regression are known, but\nthat “it is likely from a biologic standpoint that this is when and where the regression\ntakes place in the brain.” Tr. at 323; see also Tr. at 363-67 (court examination).\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman also discussed several research articles pertaining to\nmitochondrial dysfunction and autism. He stated that the articles, which were “primarily\nstudies [of the] postmortem brain [tissue] of people with autism at different ages,\ndemonstrate[d] differences in the autis[tic] brain with respect to mitochondrial function . .\n. , DNA mutations, and content of mitochondrial activity in different areas[.]” Tr. at 324.\n\n       In the first study, researchers compared the levels and activities of various\nmitochondrial proteins in the lateral temporal lobe 88 of autistic individuals and controls\nbetween two and 67 years of age. G. Tang, et al., Mitochondrial abnormalities in\ntemporal lobe of autistic brain, NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE, 54: 349-61 (2013), filed as\nPet. Ex. 65 [hereinafter “Tang, Pet. Ex. 65”]. The researchers confirmed previous\nfindings of “decrease[ed] protein expression and Complex I and IV enzyme activities in\nthe temporal cortex” of ASD patients. Id. at 350. Additionally, they found “decreased\nprotein levels of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2 and increased oxidative\nmtDNA damage in ASD patients aged 2-9 years.” Id. Other differences in the ASD\nbrain included altered mitochondrial dynamics due to an imbalance between fission and\nfusion proteins, and increased mitochondrial mass due to increased levels of\nmitochondrial membrane proteins. Id. The authors noted that “[m]any of these changes\nwere evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but\nwere less pronounced or absent in adult patients.” Id. at 349. The authors concluded\n\n88\n  The lateral temporal lobe is “involved in auditory processing [and] language and social perception,”\nareas “implicated in ASD-associated behaviors.” Tang, Pet. Ex. 65, at 350; see also Tr. at 329.\n\n\n                                                    54\n\fthat the study provided “evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox\nstatus are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial\ndysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.” Id.\n\n        In a second study, researchers compared the protein levels of various\nmitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain (“ETC”) complexes in different brain\nregions from individuals with autism and age-matched controls. A. Chauhan, et al.,\nBrain region-specific deficit in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes in\nchildren with autism, J. NEUROCHEM., 117: 209-20 (2011), filed as Pet. Ex. 69\n[hereinafter “Chauhan, Pet. Ex. 69”]. 89 The researchers found that “children with autism\nshowed a decrease in protein levels of ETC complexes in the cerebellum and the frontal\nand temporal cortices,” but no differences “in the occipital and parietal cortices.” Id. at\n210. The researchers noted with interest that when the data was analyzed “as a\nfunction of age, children with autism (4-10 years of age) but not adults with autism (14-\n39 years of age) showed lower protein levels of brain ETC complexes[.]” Id. This\nsuggested “that developmental mitochondrial abnormalities resulting in mitochondrial\ndysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormal energy metabolism may contribute to [the]\nautistic phenotype.” Id.\n\n       In response to questioning, Dr. Zimmerman stated that the “most important\nfinding” in these two studies was the “clear difference between younger and older brains\nwith respect to mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 324. He stated that the researchers’\nfindings mirrored his own experience with regard to the changes seen in certain clinical\nand laboratory measures as children age. Id. “I don’t find them after they’re . . . school-\nage, after five to ten.” Tr. at 324. Indeed, if he tested A.A. today, he would expect her\nresults to be different from those obtained years earlier. Tr. at 325. On this last point,\nDr. Zimmerman was asked on cross examination whether he “believe[d] she has a\ndisorder of mitochondrial metabolism anymore.” Tr. at 351. He stated, “if she does, it’s\ngoing to be difficult to find it.” Tr. at 351.\n\n        Doctor Zimmerman viewed these differences as indicative of “a developmental\nprocess” that is “probably genetically regulated.” Tr. at 325; see also Tr. at 363-67\n(court examination). He explained that mitochondrial abnormalities are “more\npronounced at the younger ages” due to “differences in gene expression” during\ndifferent stages of development. Tr. at 326. “The genes that we inherit may be the\nsame, but the way they’re expressed . . . varies from one month or year to the next[]”—\n“allow[ing] for growth and development.” Tr. at 326. This dynamic biochemical\nenvironment has made it difficult, however, to “nail down” the causes of autism, with\nmany remaining elusive. Tr. at 326. He endorsed the idea that a child’s particular\nautistic symptoms are determined by the state of his or her brain at the time an “insult\noccurs.” Tr. at 327. This is why “there’s so much heterogeneity . . . [in] children with\nautism”—“virtually no two children are the same who have that diagnosis.” Tr. at 327.\n\n\n89\n   The study was “the first to report on brain mitochondrial abnormalities in autism.” Chauhan, Pet. Ex. 69\nat 216.\n\n\n                                                    55\n\f        Doctor Zimmerman specifically referenced several portions of the Tang article he\nthought were noteworthy, including the researchers’ confirmation of earlier findings by\nChauhan that ETC abnormalities were more severe in ASD children than adult patients.\nTr. at 327 (citing Tang, Pet. Ex. 65, at 357-58). Also significant was Tang’s speculation\nthat ETC abnormalities “may be secondary to environmental stressors, including\naberrant calcium signaling, alterations in immune functions,[toxic compounds], or\noxidative stress.” Tr. at 332 (citing Tang, Pet. Ex. 65 at 358 (citing S.J. James, et al.,\nCellular and mitochondrial glutathione redox imbalance in lymphoblastoid cells derived\nfrom children with autism, FASEB J., 23:2374-83 (2009))).\n\n       When asked to elaborate on what the researchers’ statements indicated\nregarding potential causes of autism, Dr. Zimmerman stated:\n\n       Well, it’s a – it means that the – the mitochondrial dysfunction may be an\n       important underlying factor when other stresses take place. Inflammation,\n       we know that autism can occur after or with certain infections. We know,\n       at least in some cases, that it may be associated with immunizations.\n       Anything that causes stress for the – on the mitochondrial system, and if\n       the – if mitochondrial activity is less than sufficient to support synaptic\n       function when it occurs, it – the – the added stress of the environmental\n       stressor, as they describe it here, could be a variety of things.\n       ...\n       That added stress, combined with a deficient mitochondrial activity,\n       embarrasses the – the cells, and many of them shut down and causes\n       continuing dysfunction.\n\nTr. at 332-33.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman also expressed familiarity with the work of Dr. Jill James,\nwhose 2009 research was cited by Tang. Tr. at 333. In response to questioning, Dr.\nZimmerman briefly discussed James’s work as it related to the Tang article. Id. He\nstated that “her work on oxidative stress . . . demonstrated that there’s increased\noxidative stress in autism for a number of reasons, including abnormalities in\nglutathione and other factors. So, it’s an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at\n333. According to Dr. Zimmerman, glutathione is an important compound regulating\nmitochondrial function. Tr. at 334. It is an antioxidant that “scavenges oxidative stress\nradicals,” which “damage membranes.” Id. He stated that the vitamin cocktail that he\nprescribes to patients with mitochondrial problems is designed to reduce oxidative\nstress. Id. He further stated that his and Dr. James’s work could be considered\nmutually supportive. Tr. at 335.\n\n       With regard to the Chauhan article, Dr. Zimmerman briefly noted the studies’\nfindings that young children with autism had “[l]ower levels of Complexes III and V in the\ncerebellum; Complex I in the frontal cortex; and Complex II, III, and V in the temporal\ncortex” as compared to older children and adults with autism. Tr. at 340 (citing\nChauhan, Pet. Ex. 69 at 211-12). These findings were significant to Dr. Zimmerman\n\n\n                                            56\n\fbecause they were “consistent with [his] findings clinically that . . . differences are more\napparent in young children compared to older children and adults.” Tr. at 341.\n\n        In a third article discussed by Dr. Zimmerman, researchers studied the\n“expression of 84 genes related to diverse functions of mitochondria, including\nbiogenesis, transport, translocation and apoptosis” in the postmortem brain tissues of\nautism patients and controls. A. Anitha, et al., Brain region-specific altered expression\nand association of mitochondria-related genes in autism, MOLECULAR AUTISM, 3:1-12\n(2012), filed as Pet. Ex. 66 [hereinafter “Anitha, Pet. Ex. 66”], at 1. They also studied\nthe associations of certain genes with autism. The researchers examined brain tissues\nfrom the anterior cingulate gyrus, motor cortex, and thalamus, and found that “[s]everal\ngenes showed brain region-specific expression alterations in autism patients compared\nto controls.” Id. at 1. For example, some genes showed “consistently reduced\nexpression” in autism patients. Id. Other genes showed an association with autism in\nsome samples. Id. The researchers concluded that the “[d]ysfunction of these genes\ncould lead to defects in mitochondrial activities, including energy metabolism, thus\naugmenting and disseminating several brain abnormalities related to autism. Id. at 10.\nSignificantly, they conceded that it was not clear if mitochondrial dysfunction “is the\ncause or effect of autism,” noting that “ASD patients have often been found to manifest\nbiochemical or neuropathological traits linked with altered mitochondrial function.” Id. at\n9.\n\n       In response to questioning, Dr. Zimmerman explained that the brain regions\nexamined by the researchers—the anterior cingulate gyrus, motor cortex, and\nthalamus—are thought to be areas from which autistic symptoms can arise. Tr. at 335-\n36. He stated that the cingulate gyrus is “an important area, because it integrates social\nand language and frontal lobe activity, and it’s very much affected in autism.” Tr. at\n335. He also noted that it was one of the areas he “studied extensively” in his work on\nmicroglial activation. Tr. at 335. The motor cortex, on the other hand, “is generally\nunaffected in autism compared to other areas.” Tr. at 335. Finally, the thalamus “is an\nimportant sensory way station” that “integrates sensory inputs and sends fibers out to\ndifferent areas of the brain.” Tr. at 335-36. He cautioned, however, that linking the\nsensory issues seen in autism “directly to the thalamus” would be incorrect—“they’re\nprobably widespread in the brain.” Tr. at 336.\n\n       The study was noteworthy to Dr. Zimmerman because it showed differences in\ngene expression in the studied regions of the brain. Tr. at 336. The findings were\nimportant because abnormal gene expression results in changes—increases or\ndecreases—in the production of proteins critical to proper cell function and energy\nmetabolism, which is especially crucial during early development when the brain is\ngrowing and making connections. Tr. at 336-38. For example, “in the temporal lobe, if\nyour mitochondrial function is decreased at a critical age,” the cells in that area will be\nless able to respond “when an insult occurs.” Tr. at 338. He emphasized that the\ntemporal lobe is very sensitive to insults, especially in the context of mitochondrial\ndysfunction. Tr. at 338.\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\f        The final article discussed by Dr. Zimmerman studied gene dysregulation in\nautism. M.R. Ginsberg, et al., Brain Transcriptional and Epigenetic Associations with\nAutism, PLOS ONE, 7(9):e44736 (2012), filed as Pet. Ex. 67 [hereinafter “Ginsberg, Pet.\nEx. 67”]. The researchers analyzed cerebellar and occipital brain tissues from\nidiopathic autistic patients and controls. Id. at 1. They identified “[n]o changes in DNA\nmethylation . . . in autistic brain but [found] gene expression abnormalities in two areas\nof metabolism [.]” Id. Specifically, the researchers found “down-regulation of genes of\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of protein translation[,]” as well as\n“associations between specific behavioral domains of autism and specific brain gene\nexpression modules related to myelin/myelination, inflammation/immune response and\npurinergic signaling.” Id. According to the researchers, their work highlighted “two\nlargely unrecognized molecular pathophysiological themes in autism and suggest[ed]\ndiffering molecular bases for autism behavioral endophenotypes.” Id.\n\n       Doctor Zimmerman had little to say about this article; however, in response to\nquestioning he attempted to explain its significance. He stated:\n\n          The important thing here is that they find differences in genes that don’t –\n          they don’t find the differences in the occipital brain tissue . . . compared to\n          the cerebellum. The cerebellum is another area of involvement in autism,\n          whereas we look at the occipital region of the brain as being relatively\n          uninvolved, unaffected.\n\nTr. at 338-39. He emphasized that this study supported an earlier point he had made:\nthat the brain is not uniformly affected by autism—that “[d]ifferent regions of the brain\ncan be differentially affected.” Tr. at 339.\n\n          2. Doctor Kelley.\n\n       Of the four experts that testified, Dr. Kelley’s testimony was the most challenging\nand least persuasive. The challenge came not from the difficult subject matter, but from\nDr. Kelley’s inability to clearly explain his methods and theories. As shown below, his\ntestimony was littered with confusing tangents, unfocused narrative, and half-answered\nquestions. His testimony was more poorly supported by published studies than that of\nthe other witnesses, and in many cases the basis for his opinions were essentially\n“because I say so.”\n\n       In his expert report, Dr. Kelley opined that A.A.’s history of acute regression,\npersisting neurological deficits, and biochemical abnormalities, were “compatible” with a\n“diagnosis of an inborn error 90 of mitochondrial energy metabolism”—specifically, a\nfunctional complex I deficiency. Pet. Ex. 23 at 2. Of particular significance to his\nopinion were test results obtained by Dr. Zimmerman, which showed “increased plasma\nlevels of alanine and glycine, an increased AST to ALT ratio, a mildly increased creatine\nkinase level, electrolyte evidence of a metabolic acidosis, and a mildly increased blood\n\n90\n     He stated that the causative mutation had not been identified. Pet. Ex. 28 at 4.\n\n\n                                                       58\n\flactate level.” 91 Id. These results, together with A.A.’s history and clinical presentation,\nwere “convincing” evidence of “a primary or secondary mitochondrial disorder.” 92 Id.\n\n        Doctor Kelley elaborated that, in his experience “a combined increase in the\nplasma levels of alanine and glycine in a child with other clinical and biochemical signs\nof mitochondrial dysfunction and regressive autism always proves on muscle biopsy to\nbe a deficiency of complex I or complex I + III.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 2 (citing J. Weissman, et\nal., Mitochondrial Disease in Autism Spectrum Disorder Patients: A Cohort Analysis,\nPLoS ONE, 3 (11): e3815 (2008), filed as Pet. Ex. 28 [hereinafter “Weissman, Pet. Ex.\n28”]). Indeed, this finding is so consistent that he no longer orders “muscle biopsies for\ndiagnosis of suspected mitochondrial disease.” Id.; see also Tr. at 193; 275-78.\nAdditionally, Dr. Kelley viewed A.A.’s positive response to treatment with L-carnitine 93\nand other elements of the mitochondrial vitamin cocktail as supportive of the complex I\ndiagnosis. Id. at 2, 4. He also stated that his analysis of A.A.’s amino acid profile\nshowed her “profile [to be] the same as [that found] in most other children with\nregressive autism.” Id. at 2 (citing Pet. Ex. 23A).\n\n         Doctor Kelley then offered his theory of “how a child with a mitochondrial disorder\ncould be asymptomatic and developing normally for the first 15 months and then\nregress to a state of autism shortly after receiving an MMR vaccination.” Pet. Ex. 23 at\n2-3. He explained that his clinical work at the Kennedy Krieger Institute led him to the\ndiscovery of “mitochondrial autism.” 94 Id. at 3. According to Dr. Kelley, children who\nhave this “etiologically heterogeneous clinical disorder typically appear to be normal for\ntheir first 12 months or more before a viral illness or other stress[,] such as, rarely, an\nimmunization, provides the critical metabolic stress that sufficiently compromises energy\nmetabolism in the brain to precipitate acute or subacute cognitive and motor losses.” Id.\n\n\n91\n  He noted that genetic testing was negative for identifiable genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder,\nincluding Fragile X testing, Rett syndrome mutation analysis, and urinary organic acid analysis. Pet. Ex.\n23 at 2.\n92\n  At hearing, Dr. Kelley was asked to define primary and secondary mitochondrial disease. He stated\nthat primary mitochondrial disease involves a “primary genetic defect in some component of the\nmitochondrion;” he did not clearly define secondary mitochondrial disease, implying that only deficits in\nmitochondrial DNA could be considered primary defects. Tr. at 182-83. However, authoritative research\nhas shown that defects in nuclear DNA also cause mitochondrial problems. See R. Haas, et al., The In-\nDepth Evaluation of Suspected Mitochondrial Disease: The Mitochondrial Medicine Society’s Committee\non Diagnosis, MOL. GENET. METAB., 94 (1): 16-37 (2008), filed as Res. Ex. H [hereinafter “Haas, Res. Ex.\nH”], at 31) (stating that “[a]n estimated 75%-90% of pediatric primary mitochondrial disease results from\nnDNA mutations”).\n93\n  He noted that A.A.’s initial negative response of “increased excitability and agitation immediately after\nstarting carnitine” was not surprising, as “similar reactions occur in a subset of children with complex I\ndeficiency and can be taken as supporting evidence for that diagnosis.” Id. at 2.\n94\n  To aid in his explanation, Dr. Kelley appended a document entitled “Evaluation and Treatment of\nPatients with Autism and Mitochondrial Disease,” which contained his unpublished research on this topic.\nSee Pet. Ex. 23B.\n\n\n                                                     59\n\f       He hypothesized that the injury likely occurs during this “window of vulnerability”\nbecause of an increase in glutamate-receptor density in the frontal cortex, “which is\nestimated to peak at 18 months.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. According to Dr. Kelley, research\nhas shown that increased glutamate-receptor density raises “the risk for excitotoxic\nneuronal damage.” Id. He claimed that it is generally accepted that “any decrease in\nmitochondrial ATP synthesis capacity increases the sensitivity to glutamate\nexcitotoxicity.” 95 Id. (citing A. Novelli, et al., Glutamate becomes neurotoxic via the N-\nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor when intracellular energy levels are reduced, BRAIN RES.,\n451: 205-12 (1988), filed as Pet. Ex. 41 [hereinafter “Henneberry, 96 Pet. Ex. 41]). As a\nconsequence, children with “preexisting but otherwise asymptomatic mitochondrial\ndysfunction [are at] an increased risk of brain injury with chance occurrence of certain\nfactors, such [as] mitochondria-impairing inflammatory stress, during the developmental\nstage of the frontal and prefrontal cortex”—the time frame “when glutamate NMDA [N-\nMethyl-D-aspartate] 97 receptors are at their highest density.” Id.\n\n         According to Dr. Kelley, “[a]n established principle of the pathophysiology of\nacute injury in many metabolic diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, is that the\nnormal cytokine surges and catabolic stress of even simple viral infections can cause\nacute and sometimes fatal metabolic deterioration. Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. Of the “various\ncytokines released during an infection, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [“TNF-α”] is known\nto impair mitochondrial function as a normal part of the immune response that primes\ncells for mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death when infected.” Id. He has found that\nthe course of deterioration in most patients with regressive autism caused by complex I\ndeficiency occurs “over days to weeks, often preceded in the parents’ recollection by a\nviral illness, ear infection, or similar infectious process.” Id. He noted, however, that in\nrare cases, “the regression follows within 48 hours of one or more immunizations, as\nillustrated by the now publicly known case of [child’s first name] Poling.” 98 Id. (citing\nPoling, Pet. Ex. 25A at 171). Doctor Kelley stated that the “most important fact linking\n[A.A.’s] deterioration to her MMR vaccination is that the peak level of TNF-alpha\nfollowing immunization with the measles component of the MMR is between 10 and 15\ndays.” Id. at 3 (citing I. Ovsyannikova, et al., Cytokine production patterns and antibody\n\n95\n  Excitotoxicity refers to the degree to which a given substance has a toxic excitatory effect on the\nnervous system. DORLAND’S at 653. An excitotoxin is any of a group of neurotoxic substances that are\nanalogous to glutamic acid and mimic its excitatory effects on neurons of the central nervous system\n(e.g., N-Methyl-D-aspartate). Id.\n96\n  In his report and subsequent testimony, Dr. Kelley referred to this article by the name of one of its co-\nauthors, R. Henneberry.\n97\n N-Methyl-D-aspartate is a neurotransmitter similar to glutamate, found in the central nervous system.\nDORLAND’S at 1152.\n98\n   Doctor Kelley speculated that the regression the Poling child experienced within 48 hours was due to\nher receipt of “several killed-virus vaccines, which can induce immediate inflammatory responses\nbecause of previous immunizations with the same vaccines.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. However, none of the\nlisted vaccines in Poling, Pet. Ex. 25A, were killed virus vaccines. Either Dr. Kelley misspoke, or he was\nsimply unaware of the nature of the relevant vaccines.\n\n\n                                                     60\n\fresponse to measles vaccine, VACCINE, 21: 3946-53 (2003), filed as Pet. Ex. 71\n[hereinafter “Poland, 99 Pet. Ex. 71”]).\n\n       Doctor Kelley acknowledged the “absence of an association between the MMR\nvaccine and autism in large epidemiological studies.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3. He also stated\nthat “autistic regressions caused by the live attenuated MMR vaccine are rare events.”\nId. However, in his view, the lack of statistical support between vaccines and autistic\nregression was not evidence against vaccine causation, but simply an indication that\nthere are a “wide variety” of inflammatory factors that can precipitate a regression. Id.\n\n      In conclusion, Dr. Kelley reiterated his opinion that A.A. had “biochemical\nabnormalities diagnostic of an inborn error of mitochondrial metabolism, best\ncharacterized functionally as complex I deficiency, but with an as yet unidentified\ncausative mutation.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 4. He further opined, to a reasonable degree of\nmedical certainty, that the “MMR vaccination administered 1 to 2 weeks before the\nonset of [A.A.’s] autistic regression at age 15 months was the direct precipitant of her\nneurological injury, leaving her with a diagnosis of autism with minor neuromotor\nabnormalities.” Id. He emphasized, however, that A.A.’s “mitochondrial disorder is\ncongenital and was not ‘triggered’ by the MMR vaccination. Rather, the MMR\nvaccination was simply one of several factors contributing to a typical inflammation-\nmediated metabolic injury.” Id.\n\n       At hearing, Dr. Kelley testified consistent with his expert report. He began his\ntestimony with a brief summary of A.A.’s reported medical history 100 and his\ninvolvement with her treatment. He recounted that by the time of his initial evaluation,\nDr. Zimmerman had already commenced a partial workup, the results of which “raised\nthe suspicion” of abnormal mitochondrial function. Tr. at 142-43. He noted that Dr.\nZimmerman routinely screened his autistic patients for markers of mitochondrial\nfunction, as he was “aware of the association between mitochondrial abnormalities and\nautism.” Tr. at 143. The screening involved an analysis of certain amino acid and\nenzyme levels known to be markers for mitochondrial function. Tr. at 142-4 3. The\ntesting looked for disturbances in these markers. Tr. at 143.\n\n       As an overview, Dr. Kelley explained that mitochondria are double-membraned\nsubcellular units that exist within nearly all cells of the body. Tr. at 145, 155. Their\nprimary function is energy metabolism—they convert food into energy. Tr. at 145. This\nconversion is accomplished through a process called the citric acid cycle, also known as\nthe “Krebs Cycle.” Tr. at 146, 154; see also Trial Ex. 4. He stated that food molecules,\nsuch as fatty acids and glucose, are converted into acetyl-CoA, which is then combined\nwith oxaloacetate to make citrate. Tr. at 148. Citrate is subsequently broken down in a\n99\n  The parties referred to this as the “Poland” article due to their hesitation at mispronouncing Dr.\nOvsyannikova’s name. Poland is the name of one of the other authors. To avoid confusion, I will cite to it\nas “Poland” as well.\n100\n   Doctor Kelley’s summary did not differ in any important respect from that previously testified to by Mr.\nAllen, Ms. Edick, and Dr. Zimmerman, and will therefore not be detailed here.\n\n\n                                                     61\n\fseries of steps wherein electrons and protons are extracted for addition to other\nmolecules. Tr. at 148-49. In this pathway, variously known as the “electron transport\nchain” and “respiratory chain,” electrons are combined with adenosine diphosphate\n(“ADP”) to produce adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”), the basic energy currency of the\ncell. Tr. at 149-50. The process of transforming ADP to ATP is called oxidative\nphosphorylation, also known as “OXPHOS.” Tr. at 154. Dr. Kelley explained that the\nelectron transport chain consists of a series of five protein complexes, 101 each\ncomposed of numerous smaller protein subunits, 102 some of which are encoded by the\nmitochondrial genome, but mostly by the nuclear genome. Tr. at 149. He stated that\n“most mitochondrial disease . . . relates to dysfunction in the electron transport chain.”\nTr. at 149, 153.\n\n        In addition to fatty acids and glucose, proteins are also processed through the\ncitric acid cycle. Tr. at 150. However, instead of generating acetyl-CoA, proteins are\nbroken down into their component amino acids or converted into intermediates in the\ncycle. Tr. at 150. Doctor Kelley explained that abnormal levels of certain plasma amino\nacids can be an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction, which is why amino acid testing,\nsuch as that performed by Dr. Zimmerman, is used for screening for mitochondrial\ndisease. Tr. at 150.\n\n        Doctor Kelley discussed the significance of pyruvate, lactate, and alanine as\nindicators for metabolic functioning. Tr. at 155. Before entering the citric acid cycle,\nglucose must first be converted to pyruvate through a pathway known as glycolysis.\nPyruvate is subsequently converted to acetyl-CoA or oxaloacetate for use in the citric\nacid cycle. Tr. at 148. Doctor Kelley explained that because of its role, pyruvate would\nbe a valuable measure of mitochondrial function; unfortunately, it is a very unstable\ncompound not easily or accurately measured. 103 Tr. at 155. Researchers have instead\nlooked to lactate and alanine as proxies for pyruvate because they are in equilibrium.\nId. However, because lactate is subject to artifacts in collection, “many people in the\nfield have adopted using alanine as a proxy for pyruvate at the same time they measure\nlactate.” Tr. at 155-56; see also Tr. at 169. Alanine is a stable amino acid in “very close\nequilibrium with pyruvate.” Tr. at 155.\n101\n    The electron transport chain is composed of five complexes, designated with Roman numerals (I-V).\nEach complex has a defined role in the metabolism of food molecules and the production of ATP. The\ncitric acid cycle is associated with Complex II. Tr. at 151-54.\n102\n      Doctor Kelley estimated that Complex I, for example, has more than 40 protein subunits. Tr. at 149.\n103\n    Doctor Kelley stated that pyruvate “is very, very difficult to measure except in a research laboratory.”\nTr. at 169. I note that I have frequently seen laboratory reports in Vaccine Act cases at least purporting to\nmeasure pyruvate or, more often, a pyruvate/lactate ratio, and that the ratio is commonly used as a\ndiagnostic criterion in several of the most commonly used diagnostic systems. See, e.g., E. Walker, et\nal., Respiratory Chain Encephalopmyopathies: A Diagnostic Classification, Eur. Neurol., 36: 260-67\n(1996) at 262, filed as Res. Ex. T [hereinafter “Walker, Res. Ex. T”]; E. Morava, et al., Mitochondrial\ndisease criteria: Diagnostic applications in children, Neurol., 67: 1823-26 (2006) at Table C,II, filed as\nRes. Ex. U [hereinafter “Morava, Res. Ex. U”]; F. Bernier, et al., Diagnostic criteria for respiratory chain\ndisorders in adults and children, Neurology, 59: 1406-11 (2002) at 1409, filed as Res. Ex. V [hereinafter\n“Bernier, Res. Ex. V”].\n\n\n                                                      62\n\f        Additionally, Dr. Kelley emphasized the importance of the amino acid proline,\nwhich “most biochemists know is a . . . marker for lactate.” Tr. at 167; see also Tr. at\n187-89 (direct); 665-68 (court examination). He analogized proline levels to the function\nof hemoglobin A1c in measuring average blood glucose levels over time. 104 Tr. at 167,\n188. He explained that similar to hemoglobin A1c, proline levels, measured from a\nstandardized collection, can show whether lactate was increased during a previous,\nalbeit shorter, period. 105 Tr. at 168, 188.\n\n        According to Dr. Kelley, glycine is also an important indicator of mitochondrial\nfunction. Tr. at 169. Based on observation, he has learned that glycine levels are\n“virtually always increased” in patients who have a Complex I deficiency diagnosed with\nmuscle biopsy. Tr. at 169. He attempted to explain; however, the result was less than\nclear:\n\n        When I use the term [Complex I deficiency] clinically, I mean a relative\n        impair – a relative block in the system at Complex I, which is where\n        pyruvate is oxidized. So if you have anything that impairs Complex I,\n        either a primary lesion in Complex I or a decrease in mitochondrial protein\n        synthesis, because Complex I is a rate-limiting step, if one decreases the\n        amount of mitochondrial protein overall, the first sign of a problem is a\n        block at Complex I[.] . . . [A]lanine goes up and glycine goes up[.] . . . It’s\n        not entirely known why; it’s more observational.\n\n               But one of the main systems for metabolizing glycine directly\n        connects with Complex I. So, the speculation is that [glycine] is high\n        because it – you know, to get impairing pyruvate dehydrogenase’s\n        function impaired Complex I, impaired Complex I function impairs the\n        glycine cleavage enzyme, as it’s called.\n\nTr. at 169.\n\n        Doctor Kelley summarized that “the point [of] looking at the amino acids . . . is not\nso much to make a specific diagnosis, but to [ask] what’s wrong with the\nmitochondrion?” Tr. at 157. He noted that not every mitochondrial disease disturbs\ncitric acid cycle function, but most interfere in some way. Tr. at 157. Thus, “particular\ndisturbances” in amino acid levels can provide insight into where the metabolic process\nis not working properly and enable treatment. Tr. at 157. Doctor Kelley indicated that it\n\n\n\n104\n   Hemoglobin A1c is a glycosylated form of hemoglobin. Tr. at 187. It reflects mean levels of blood\nglucose over approximately the preceding three month period. Tr. at 188.\n105\n  In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley stated that the length of the measurement is “not anywhere\nnear as long as hemoglobin A1c [, but] it’s a surrogate for a phenomena that you would like to be able to\nmeasure on an hourly basis, but you can’t.” Tr. at 667.\n\n\n                                                    63\n\fwas possible to determine where a block was occurring based on the amino acid profile\nand the given symptoms. 106 Tr. at 158.\n\n       Doctor Kelley then turned to A.A.’s amino acid profile, contained in Pet. Ex.\n23A, 107 and his interpretation of the results. Tr. at 159. As a preface to the discussion,\nhe stated that his method of analysis was “an elaboration on what many people do”—\nonly taken “a couple steps further.” Tr. at 159.\n\n        The profile was displayed in the form of a spreadsheet, with numerous columns\nand rows filled with data. The first column listed various amino acids of biological\nsignificance in the diagnosis of disease—30 in total. Tr. at 623. This was followed by a\ncolumn of “range” values for each amino acid. Doctor Kelley stated that the ranges\nwere found in a “paper from many years ago” where the authors “simply took a lot of\namino acid samples from their clinical service, measured these ranges and published\nthem in . . . a manual for metabolic diagnosis.” 108 Tr. at 174; see also Tr. at 623; 628-\n29 (redirect); 662-65 (court examination).\n\n        The next column displayed “mean” values, which Dr. Kelley “determined and\nrecalculated” using historical data from 100 samples he collected at his laboratory. 109\nTr. at 162, 176-77; see also Tr. at 624-25; 627-28 (redirect); 662-65 (court examination).\nHe noted that the samples were all taken following a four-hour fast, the significance of\nwhich he discussed later in his testimony. Tr. at 161, 177; see also Tr. at 624-25\n(redirect).\n\n      Adjacent to these initial columns were two columns of A.A.’s “amino acid data”\nobtained from testing performed on February 14, 2002, at KKI [the “KKI test”], and on\n\n106\n   As an example, Dr. Kelley discussed Barth syndrome, a genetic X-linked metabolic condition that\ncauses boys to develop, among other things, cardiomyopathy. Tr. at 158; see also Tr. at 192. He stated\nthat patients with this condition have extremely low levels of the amino acid arginine, which interferes with\ntheir ability to produce sufficient muscle protein. Tr. at 158. When he studied this disorder, Dr. Kelley\nhypothesized that a block existed at a certain enzyme; when he gave the children arginine, “it cure[d] the\nheart disease.” Tr. at 159. “So that’s . . . one of the more good examples of how one can look at the\namino acids and learn a lot about mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 159.\n107\n      Also filed as Trial Ex. 5.\n108\n   This paper was not submitted as an exhibit in this case. Doctor Kelley elaborated that he continues to\nuse these traditional ranges because he is “not at the point yet of publishing” his own range values. Tr. at\n175. He still needs to “go[] through all the documentation to say that . . . [his] new values are valid.” Id.\nDoctor Kelley stated that the traditional ranges were not based on samples obtained after a four-hour fast.\nTr. at 629.\n109\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley stated that the historical data he used was not publicly available for\nreview or verification. Tr. at 654-55. He stated that all of the samples were collected from children with\ndevelopmental problems; their diagnoses, however, were believed to have no effect on biochemistry. Tr.\nat 653-54. In response to another question, Dr. Kelley stated that he had not yet generated ranges for\nthe mean values because he “wanted to get up to 200” samples; however he promised that “the data are\nthere” and he could “fill them up on a spreadsheet now.” Tr. at 655.\n\n\n                                                     64\n\fAugust 21, 2002, by Quest [the “Quest test”], an independent commercial laboratory. 110\nTr. at 161; see also Tr. at 631 (redirect). The numbers represented the raw data\nobtained from the testing. Tr. at 631. These columns were followed by a set of\ncolumns containing “ratios to mean” values for the amino acid data. Doctor Kelley\nexplained that the ratio to mean for each result was calculated by dividing a given amino\nacid value by the corresponding mean value. Tr. at 162. For instance, the proline value\nfrom the KKI test was 137 and the related mean value was 161, so “137 divided by 161\nis .85,” which was the ratio to mean for that test result. Tr. at 162; see also Tr. at 632-\n35 (redirect).\n\n         The final set of columns contained “normalized ratios to mean” 111 values, which\nwere a key component of his analysis. Unfortunately, Dr. Kelley had significant difficulty\nelucidating how these values were calculated. See Tr. at 159-60; 165-67; 635-45. He\nbegan that it is common practice to use the ratios of certain amino acids as supportive\nevidence of a mitochondrial diagnosis. Tr. at 159-60. As an example, he noted that\nincreased pyruvate levels (or alanine as a proxy for pyruvate) relative to other “index”\namino acids, 112 such as lysine or tyrosine, is suggestive of a mitochondrial problem. 113\nTr. at 159-60. His method of analysis, he explained, takes “that concept and expand[s]\nit to involve . . . other amino acids, because each amino acid has some flaw in being\nused as an index, alanine to lysine, alanine to tyrosine.” Tr. at 160. He continued:\n\n        Each of those ratios has some pitfalls. So, we average out the ratios by\n        looking at the set of amino acids that have very few artifacts built into them\n        or are subject to very few artifacts of collection or metabolism and just\n        expand that ratio. And we simply index that to a value of one. So, we do\n        a calculation to say that if everything were exactly as it should be, the ratio\n        in this final column should be one and the – there are, I’d say, multiple\n        pathways that are related to the mitochondrial function, which can throw\n        these ratios off.\n\nTr. at 160; see also Tr. at 635-45 (redirect).\n\n       Doctor Kelley emphasized the importance of a four-hour fasting blood sample—\n“plus or minus”—to obtain accurate results. Tr. at 162, 164; see also Tr. at 626-27\n(redirect). He explained that after a meal, “amino acid levels from protein go up and\n110\n   Doctor Kelley emphasized that although the results were obtained from different laboratories, “amino\nacid quantitation is quite standardized” and “very reproducible from laboratory to laboratory.” Tr. at 161.\n111\n   Doctor Kelley stated that “normalized ratios” are ratios “divided by a number to bring them back to a\ncertain standard.” Tr. at 635.\n112\n   He indicated that the index amino acids are selected because they are known to be “largely unaffected\nby problems in the citric acid cycle or in mitochondrion, with some exceptions.” Tr. at 159.\n113\n   According to Dr. Kelley, “it’s stated, for example, in the literature that an alanine to lysine ratio greater\nthan three is evidence of a mitochondrial problem, not diagnostic, but supportive evidence of that\ndiagnosis.” Tr. at 159-60.\n\n\n                                                       65\n\fthey go up in an unpredictable way based on . . . what someone eats.” Tr. at 163.\nWhen he orders biochemical testing, he instructs that the patient fast for between four\nand five hours. Tr. at 629. He has determined this time frame to be the “ideal range”\nbecause “everything’s back to baseline” by that point—“all [of] the [amino acid] ratios\nare relatively constant.” Tr. at 163-64; see also Tr. at 177-79 (direct); 630-31 (redirect).\nHe stated that he did not know the exact amount of time A.A. fasted for the KKI test, but\nhe could “tell that it was more than four hours” based on the lower-than-expected levels\nof certain amino acids. Tr. at 163; see also Tr. at 177-79 (direct). The Quest test,\nhowever, was performed “with very specific instructions to fast for four hours.” 114 Tr. at\n161; see also Tr. at 659 (cross).\n\n       Doctor Kelley explained that he drew the conclusion about the KKI test by\ncomparing the amino acid values with the corresponding mean values. 115 He stated that\nthe test values were lower than the mean values, which indicated to him that A.A. had\nfasted for more than four hours. Tr. at 164, 177-78. To illustrate his point, he directed\nattention to specific results on the spreadsheet. He began with glutamic acid; however,\nthe KKI result was higher than the mean, while the Quest result was lower, which was\nopposite of what he wanted to show. Tr. at 164; see Pet. Ex. 23A. Doctor Kelley\nquickly moved on because “well, glutamic acid is not one of the ones that we used\nbecause it’s subject to artifacts.” Tr. at 164. He then pointed to the branched chain\namino acids, “which are pretty reliable.” Tr. at 164. The first result he noted was for\nvaline. In this instance, the KKI value was lower than the mean, but so was the Quest\nvalue—indeed, the Quest value was not only lower than the mean; it was lower than the\nKKI value. Tr. at 164. Eventually, he found results (isoleucine and leucine) to support\nhis point. Tr. at 164. “As I say, there’s a lot of variation, minor variation.” Tr. at 164-65.\n\n       Typical of his testimony as a whole, Dr. Kelley then launched into a meandering,\nconfusing, and completely unpersuasive elaboration of his unique insights and methods.\nTr. at 165-67. Immediately following the above-described explanation, he continued:\n\n        But the – when you average everything up, they’re – when you take an\n        average of all these ratios – so, this is a – each one of these is a ratio to\n        the mean. And for about 14 of these – of the amino acids that are not\n        subject to or have few things that influence their level other than the time\n        after a meal, which if you average all of those ratios, you find that the ratio\n        for sample one at KKI was .9 – it got cut off. It’s like .9 and the one here\n\n114\n   Doctor Kelley stated that he did not presume that his instructions were followed. Tr. at 659. He\nexplained that the values themselves were indicative of a four hour fast—he knows the values that certain\ncompounds should have at four hours fasting. Tr. at 660.\n115\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley was asked whether it was problematic to compare A.A.’s amino acid\nvalues, which were from a supposed non-fasting sample, against mean values generated from four-hour\nfasting samples. Tr. at 656-57. He replied that “generally” one would want to compare four-hour fasting\nsamples to other four-hour fasting samples; however, his calculations bring everything “back to some\nstandard.” Tr. at 657. He understood how the concept “may be a little foreign” to those “not used to\nstatistics.” Id.\n\n\n                                                   66\n\f        was, I think, 1.05 or something like that. .9, the ratios are all less – means\n        that the average ratio is less than one, which means that she’s gone\n        beyond the four-hour fasting point. The one that – from a physiologic\n        standpoint. It could have been four hours fasting, but physiologically, she\n        was beyond what we see in the average four-hour fasting sample. So, it’s\n        simply a way of being able to compare one amino acid sample to another\n        one, in a standardized way if the – if the – too many amino acid ratios are\n        too high or too many are too low, I, in effect, throw out the sample. I say I\n        can’t evaluate that. It has to be close to what we would predict for a four-\n        hour fasting sample. This is – I think a lot of my colleagues recognize this\n        is not standardized – or it’s not a standard approach, but it is – I’ve been\n        doing it for ten years or so and it’s a – it just makes the interpretation so\n        much simpler. 116\n\nTr. at 165; see also Tr. at 635-45 (redirect).\n\n        Despite the unconventional nature of his method, Dr. Kelley was confident that\nthe resulting data could be used “in a significant way for [A.A.] because we’re very\ncareful to standardize the conditions to produce the state where the amino acid levels in\nthe blood reflect the physiology of the mitochondrion and other things.” Tr. at 166. He\nexplained that this provides a “stable basis for comparison” so that he can “go through\nthe calculations.” Tr. at 166-67. Doctor Kelley did not explicitly state what “the\ncalculations” produced, but he seemed to be referring to the normalized ratios to mean\nvalues, which he indicated would all be “one” if he obtained “a perfectly normal sample\nof four hours fasting in the ideal child.” Tr. at 166-67. In passing, he also mentioned\nthat the range values for the normalized ratios to mean, noted on the spreadsheet as\n“0.8 to 1.2 (approx),” were based on 200 controls he had collected in his laboratory. Tr.\nat 167. Although the underlying data was not disclosed, Dr. Kelley assured that he has\n“the statistics [to] show that the normal range for most of these ratios is 0.8 to 1.2.” Tr.\nat 167; see also Tr. at 181.\n\n        Doctor Kelley then discussed the specific test results in A.A.’s profile that he\nviewed as indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction—particularly those for glycine,\nalanine, and proline. Tr. at 168-70. However, rather than focusing on the actual test\nvalues, which were often within the expected range, he emphasized the normalized\nratios to mean values that he derived using his unpublished methodology. 117 The actual\nvalues for glycine were normal for both tests (KKI and Quest), while the normalized\n\n116\n   Doctor Kelley stated that his approach was a “logical extension” of other established methodologies\nused to study metabolic disorders. Tr. at 647. He elaborated that his methods were “in effect, bringing\namino acid analysis up to date. It’s fallen far behind other methodologies in simply using normal ranges.\nAnd that’s rather primitive in the analysis of amino acids because of the difficulty of obtaining samples on\nchildren.” Tr. at 647.\n117\n  Doctor Kelley explained that he generally does not rely on the traditional range values in his analysis\nbecause they are established in “laboratories run by PhDs” who are not necessarily aware of\nphysiology—“they’re not clinicians.” Tr. at 172.\n\n\n                                                     67\n\fratios were both elevated. 118 Tr. at 170; Pet. Ex. 23A at 2. For alanine, the actual value\nwas normal for the KKI test, but significantly elevated for the Quest test; however, both\nnormalized ratios were elevated. 119 Id. Similarly, the actual value for proline was\nnormal for the KKI test, but elevated for the Quest test. Id. When he “normalized” the\nratios for proline, only the Quest test was elevated. 120 Id.\n\n         Doctor Kelley addressed these discordant results by reiterating the importance of\ncollecting blood samples under standardized conditions—especially the four-hour fast\nprotocol. Tr. at 170; see also Tr. at 644-46 (redirect). He attributed the apparently\nnormal results for the KKI test to A.A. having fasted well beyond the ideal time frame,\nmaking it an unreliable measure of mitochondrial function. Tr. at 168-70, 186. In\ncontrast, the Quest sample, which was collected under the stringent “ideal conditions”\ndirected by Dr. Kelley, showed “high proline, which means high lactate, [and] a high\nglycine and a high alanine that imply Complex I deficiency.” Tr. at 170. With that said,\nhe still found the normalized ratios for the KKI test to be “convincing” given that the\nglycine and alanine values were 5.6 and 4.4 standard deviations above normal,\nrespectively. 121 Tr. at 170. As a comparison, the normalized ratio for alanine from the\nQuest sample was “ten standard deviations above normal.” Tr. at 167; see also Tr. at\n181 (stating that the alanine value of 2.09 was “almost 11 standard deviations above\nnormal”).\n\n       According to Dr. Kelley, A.A.’s amino acid profile reflected the “classic pattern” of\na child with Complex I deficiency and regressive autism. Tr. at 178. He elaborated that\neither sample was “very suspicious” because glycine and alanine increased together\n“almost always, at least 90 percent of the time, . . . comes back as a Complex I\ndeficiency [on] a muscle biopsy.” 122 Tr. at 178-79; see also Tr. at 193-94.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Kelley stated that he uses the term “Complex I\ndeficiency” from a functional standpoint. Tr. at 237-38. He explained that “Complex I\ndeficiencies for most people mean[] a specific deficiency of [the] Complex I subunit, for\n\n118\n   The actual test values for glycine: KKI (291); Quest (292); range (87-323). The normalized ratio\nvalues for glycine: KKI (1.56); Quest (1.35); range (0.8-1.2). Pet. Ex. 23A at 2.\n119\n   The actual test values for alanine: KKI (379); Quest (634); range (136-440). The normalized ratio\nvalues for alanine: KKI (1.44); Quest (2.09); range (0.8-1.2).\n120\n    The actual test values for proline: KKI (137); Quest (282); range (51-271). The normalized ratio values\nfor proline: KKI (0.93); Quest (1.66); range (0.8-1.2).\n121\n   In response to questioning on cross examination, Dr. Kelley agreed that A.A.’s glycine levels on both\ntests were normal when evaluated against the traditional range values and became abnormal only when\nusing his own ratios. Tr. at 239-40.\n122\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley confirmed that his opinion regarding A.A.’s complex I deficiency was\nbased on the abnormalities seen in her profile, particularly the glycine and alanine values. Tr. at 238. He\nstated that the profile was “exactly what we see in an otherwise well-defined Complex I, based on\nstandard criteria, muscle biopsy, or a molecular diagnosis.” Tr. at 238.\n\n\n                                                    68\n\fexample, or a muscle biopsy showing a deficiency in Complex I.” Tr. at 238. He\ncontinued: “The studies I do show a pattern that correlates with those findings, even\nthough I can’t say and even though we know, theoretically, that abnormalities other than\nComplex I itself can cause that profile. So, I call it a Complex I profile.” Tr. at 238.\n\n       In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley stated that the normalized ratios to\nmean values for glycine and alanine on both tests were not necessarily diagnostic, but\nindicated a “very high likelihood” of Complex I deficiency. 123 Tr. at 180. Additionally, he\nstated that he would hold that opinion even if he had “just one sample” to evaluate. Tr.\nat 180. I noted that this was contrary to other diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial\ndiseases, which typically require more than one laboratory sample. 124 Tr. at 180.\nDoctor Kelley responded that multiple samples are unnecessary if collection is\nstandardized, because standardization eliminates the variability that necessitates\nnumerous samples. Tr. at 180-81.\n\n         I questioned Dr. Kelley about the frequency of discordant results from testing,\nspecifically, how often test results “would be suggestive, if not diagnostic, of a Complex\nI deficiency” from one lab and not another. Tr. at 181. In response he stated: “That will\nhappen[, but] . . . when one looks at the mean levels, they’re different – they’re obtained\nat different physiological states. One’s fasting, one’s not fasting. I don’t see a\ndiscrepancy if they’re collected at the same point of fasting.” Tr. at 181. He reiterated\nthat it is “very uncommon” to “see discordant results if they’re taken at the same level of\nfasting.” Tr. at 182; see also Tr. at 184-85.\n\n        After listening to Dr. Kelley explain his method and interpret the results, I asked\nhim how many other laboratories were using his system of analysis across the country.\nTr. at 172. He stated that he did not know if any laboratories were using it, but stated\nthat its “clinical utility” is “clear” to a number of clinicians. 125 Tr. at 173. He implied that\nthe lack of adoption by laboratories was due to his not having “had time to publish it.”\nTr. at 173. He lamented that it “takes a long time” to generate the data necessary “to\nconvince people.” Tr. at 173. Later in his testimony, Dr. Kelley stated that clinicians\nbecome convinced once he describes his method and shows them that the values for\n“proline, alanine and glycine were not normal” compared to “the other amino acids.” Tr.\nat 190. They ultimately find his method better “than the alanine-lysine ratio, which is\n\n\n123\n   Doctor Kelley later stated that taken together, the trio of normalized ratios to mean values for proline,\nglycine, and alanine from the Quest test were “in [his] view, diagnostic”—the “strength is in the numbers.”\nTr. at 187.\n124\n    See, e.g., N. Wolf and J. Smeitink, Mitochondrial disorders: A proposal for consensus diagnostic\ncriteria in infants and children, NEUROL., 59: 1402-05 (2002), filed as Court. Ex. 1 [hereinafter “Wolf and\nSmeitink, Court. Ex. 1”], at Suppl. Data (requiring at least three samples for evaluating lactate).\n125\n    On cross examination, Dr. Kelley was questioned about his method, particularly his use of normalized\nratios. Tr. at 239. He confirmed that other laboratories have not adopted his method and that he has not\npublished “how [he] got [the] ratios.” Tr. at 240-41. He clarified, though, that certain individuals within\nlaboratories have used the results of his analysis in their reports. Tr. at 240-41.\n\n                                                     69\n\fmore traditional, but . . . has many pitfalls to it.” 126 Tr. at 190. Indeed, “[o]ne could miss\na mitochondrial diagnosis just using that ratio.” 127 Tr. at 190.\n\n       Doctor Kelley discussed the treatment he ordered for A.A. based on her amino\nacid profile. Tr. at 194. He stated that the “first step” was to prescribe carnitine and “a\nstandard combination of antioxidants.” Tr. at 194-95; see also Tr. at 192-93. He\nexplained that carnitine is a vitamin-like compound that can be used to activate\nComplex I through its interaction with acetyl-CoA, a compound “very central to energy\nand metabolism.” Tr. at 195-96. He stated that for children like A.A., who are “right on\nthe edge,” carnitine can “activate Complex I and push [them] back [to stability]. [T]hat’s\nthe concept behind using carnitine.” Tr. at 196-97.\n\n       In response to questioning, Dr. Kelley elaborated on the meaning of “on the\nedge.” Tr. at 199-201. He stated that many children with mitochondrial disease or other\nmetabolic abnormalities “can be perfectly healthy and normal until they hit some stress,”\nwhich “puts a greater demand on the system” and they basically “fall apart.” Tr. at 200.\nHe explained that someone with normal Complex I activity can withstand a “certain\ndegree of impairment without seeing change whatsoever.” Tr. at 200. However,\nsomeone with lowered Complex I activity is “closer to the edge”—they are sensitive to\nadditional stress. Tr. at 200. The idea is to increase Complex I activity to move them\nback from the edge. Tr. at 200. Although it “doesn’t take away the disease entirely,” it\ncan provide them with some reserve to “withstand the daily stresses.” Tr. at 200. He\ncontinued:\n\n        So, again, . . . most children with regressive autism are . . . relatively\n        normal developmentally up to a year, and then some of the children will\n        develop regressive autism due to some stress – in the broadest sense of\n        the term “stress” – that in turn with a mitochondrial disorder or with\n        mitochondrial autism, as we call it, there are various stressors, usually an\n        infection, that they know what infections do to the mitochondria in terms of\n        lowering mitochondrial function and that is the added stress that can push\n        them over the edge and do the damage. 128\n\nTr. at 200-01.\n\n\n126\n    Doctor Kelley claimed that “[t]here’s literature published that talks about the alanine-lysine ratio, which\nis the same concept, but expanded to get rid of a lot of the artifacts.” Tr. at 190. He elaborated that “if\nsomeone understands amino acid physiology, this is not rocket science. This is very logical, very\nstraightforward.” Tr. at 191.\n127\n  Doctor Zimmerman considered this ratio in an early evaluation: “I note that she had normal quantitative\namino acids, including the alanine/lysine ratio.” Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n128\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley acknowledged that regression can occur without any\napparent stress. Tr. at 201. He stated, however, that some mitochondrial disorders were “much more\nsusceptible to stress” than others. Tr. at 201.\n\n\n                                                      70\n\f        With regard to the antioxidant component of A.A.’s treatment (i.e., the “vitamin\ncocktail”), Dr. Kelley explained that a “common phenomenon” in mitochondrial disease\nis free radical damage. Tr. at 202. He stated that a free radical is “basically an electron\ngone wild,” inflicting damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Tr. at 203. He\nstated that all mitochondria produce free radicals, but they also have a natural system\nfor trapping and neutralizing them. Tr. at 203. However, with certain functional\nimpairments, the system fails to work properly, resulting in increased free radicals. Tr.\nat 204. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, lipoic acid, and Coenzyme Q, can help\n“reverse” the damage done by free radicals. Tr. at 203-04. Doctor Kelley stated that\n“when the antioxidants are given, the abnormalities we measure in the citric acid cycle\ngradually go away, in addition to the change that occurred in Complex I with the\ncarnitine.” Tr. at 205. He recounted that in “some patients that we give carnitine, we\nsee some improvement biochemically and clinically, and then we add antioxidants and\nwe see further improvement. So, it’s a two-step treatment.” Tr. at 205. Doctor Kelley\nalso noted that A.A. was given thiamine and vitamin B5. Tr. at 208. He explained that\n“a subset of patients with Complex I deficiency” respond to thiamine, although it is not\nclear why; and vitamin B5 is thought to enhance the action of carnitine. Tr. at 208.\n\n        I questioned Dr. Kelley regarding the efficacy of vitamin cocktails in light of the\nlack of evidence showing that such treatments result in clinical improvement. Tr. at 205.\nHe responded that the reason most mitochondrial experts have not seen improvement\nis because their cocktail recipe is not properly balanced. Tr. at 207. He elaborated that\n“if you do vitamin E by itself, which some people do, it’s toxic. If you give Co-Q by itself,\nit can be toxic. You have to have the complete system activated, and very few people\ndo that.” Tr. at 207.\n\n        As to whether the vitamin cocktail was beneficial to A.A., Dr. Kelley stated that he\nhad “heard” she responded well, but conceded that he had not seen her for over 10\nyears, since 2002. 129 Tr. at 208-09. At the hearing, Dr. Kelley interacted with A.A. but\nfound it difficult to assess her progress, since he would be comparing “a child who was\njust a few years old to someone her age now.” Tr. at 208-09. He likened the\ncomparison to “apples and oranges.” Tr. at 209.\n\n       Doctor Kelley then returned to the subject of metabolic stress and how it could\nlead to an autistic regression in children with mitochondrial problems. In an unfocused\nnarrative, he attempted to discuss some of the many different “mechanisms” of injury\nthat can cause such deterioration. Tr. at 209-22. He eventually alighted on the theory\npresented in his expert report—that the inflammatory response produced by a stressor,\nsuch as an infection, a virus, or a vaccine, can cause neurological damage in children\nwith impaired mitochondrial function. Tr. at 216-17. According to Dr. Kelley, there is a\n“window of vulnerability” between the ages of 12 and 24 months, when children like A.A.\n\n\n129\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley stated that he did not perform any post-treatment\nbiochemical testing on A.A. to evaluate the cocktail’s effectiveness, although he has done such testing on\nother children in the past. Tr. at 665.\n\n\n                                                    71\n\fare highly vulnerable to the effects of metabolic stressors. 130 Tr. at 213-14. This\nvulnerability is largely due to increased glutamate NMDA receptor density in the\nforebrain during this period of development. 131 Tr. at 214. He also briefly discussed the\nrole cytokines in the inflammatory response—particularly, TNF-α, a cytokine that\ninduces apoptosis, or cell death. Tr. at 216-22. Doctor Kelley stated that in his clinical\nexperience, “if there is an identifiable event or identifiable time frame in which\nregression occurs, the factor that links it is inflammation.” Tr. at 217. In A.A.’s case, he\nsaw a “reasonable argument” for vaccine causation based on inflammation during the\nwindow of vulnerability. Tr. at 218; see also Tr. at 285-88 (redirect).\n\n        In response to questioning, Dr. Kelley indicated that inflammation from an\ninfection was different from that generated by a vaccine—it had a different cytokine\n“profile.” Tr. at 218-19. However, “correlations have not been made” regarding “what\ncombination of cytokines [is] most likely to impair mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 219.\n\n       Doctor Kelley stated that he recommends immunizations for children with\nmitochondrial disorders, unless extremely unstable. Tr. at 222-23; 651. However, as a\nprecaution he “pre-treats” such children with the asthma drug Singulair,” which “directly\nblocks the TNF-alpha system.” 132 Tr. at 223; see also Tr. at 651-52 (redirect). Although\nhe does not have any “hard data to prove that it works,” he stated that during the\nprevious 10 years none of his pre-treated patients experienced a deterioration of\nmitochondrial function. 133 Tr. at 223-25; see also Tr. at 660-62. He stated that before\nhe was comfortable clinically with the “idea of offering Singulair as a mechanism to\nprotect” he might have advised parents to “wait until two years,” because it is “very\nuncommon” to see a regression past that point.” 134 Tr. at 228. Now, all of his patients\nwith mitochondrial disease get vaccinations. Tr. at 228.\n\n130\n   The size of the “window” changed a few times. For example, in his report following his initial\nevaluation of A.A. on April 8, 2003, Dr. Kelley wrote that the period was “between 12 and 36 months.”\nPet. Ex. 6, p. 5 (emphasis added). In a July 14, 2003 letter exempting A.A. from further vaccinations he\nstated that the “window of greatest vulnerability for brain injury in children with [A.A.]’s type of metabolic\ndisorder” was “at least six years old.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 126 (emphasis added).\n131\n   Unfortunately, Dr. Kelley did not elaborate on this concept or discuss the two articles he referenced\nduring his testimony in any meaningful detail. Tr. at 213-17 (citing Henneberry, Pet. Ex. 41; M. Johnson,\net al., Neurobiology of Rett syndrome: a genetic disorder of synapse development, BRAIN DEV., 23 Suppl.\n1: S206-13 (2001), filed as Pet. Ex. 46 [hereinafter “Johnson, Pet. Ex. 46”]); see also Tr. at 287-88 (court\nexamination).\n132\n   According to Dr. Kelley, Singulair “partially blocks . . . the cytokine cascade[;] it’s thought to preserve\nimmunity to protect the child and, yet, . . . attenuate the inflammatory response that is generally\nrecognized in mitochondrial disease and other metabolic abnormalities.” Tr. at 652.\n133\n   On cross examination, Dr. Kelley stated that he does not perform antibody titers on the children to test\ntheir immune response. Tr. at 660. He acknowledged that the “non-effect” could be due to the\nvaccination not causing the harm in the first place. Tr. at 661-62.\n134\n   Doctor Kelley could not recall his recommendation for A.A. Tr. at 226-27. In a letter dated July 14,\n2003, Dr. Kelly excused A.A. from further vaccination due to her condition. The letter stated that A.A.\n“has autistic spectrum disorder and biochemical evidence of a mitochondrial disease.” It explained that\n\n                                                       72\n\f       Doctor Kelley was asked how many cases of regressive autism he has attributed\nto the MMR vaccine. Tr. at 225. He responded that he could remember only four cases\n“for sure.” Tr. at 225. He continued that when has made such attribution,\n\n        it’s usually in the window when the MMR is given and . . . the timing is\n        appropriate. Based on what is known about the immune response to the\n        MMR vaccine, the . . . cytokine response . . . peaks at about 14 days and\n        it’s – in contrast to a child like [child’s first name] Poling, who regressed\n        almost immediately when she was given a lot of inflammatory vaccines,\n        the few children that I’ve seen who have regressed with – based on\n        evidence that they’ve regressed with the MMR, it was at 10 to 14 days\n        after the immunization, which . . . [coincides with] the peak cytokine\n        response[.]\n\nTr. at 225; see also Tr. at 279-81 (redirect). He commented that it was “surprising” how\na live virus vaccine, which “is supposed to mimic infection” and stimulate the immune\nsystem “can cause such high levels of cytokines.” Tr. at 225; see also Tr. at 648\n(redirect). “Sometimes children get fevers, but it’s presumably not in the fever-\nproducing cytokines where the susceptibility occurs.” Tr. at 225-26.\n\n        At the end of his direct testimony, Dr. Kelley affirmed that it was his opinion that\nthe MMR vaccine substantially contributed to the onset of A.A.’s regressive autism. Tr.\nat 229. He stated that his opinion was largely based on the timing, which “makes sense\nin terms of the . . . pathophysiologic mechanism that we were beginning to develop at\nthat time.” Tr. at 229. He also stated that “she had clear signs of mitochondrial\ndysfunction.” Tr. at 229. He continued: “I felt . . . as I said in my report, that this is a\nvery good story . . . based on the timing and the known phenomenology of the immune\nsystem and mitochondrial interaction, this was a consistent story.” Tr. at 229. In his\nopinion, the probability was high that the vaccine “was contributory. I’ll put it that way at\nleast. So, that was my opinion at the time.” Tr. at 229.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Kelley clarified that he used the terms autism\nsecondary to mitochondrial disease, mitochondrial PDD, and mitochondrial autism\nsynonymously. Tr. at 236-37. He confirmed that “mitochondrial autism” is not a\nnationally or internationally recognized condition and is not used outside of the Kennedy\nKrieger Institute, but noted that the “association of mitochondrial disease with autism is\nquite well recognized.” Tr. at 237.\n\n      Doctor Kelley was cross-examined about various parts of his expert report. Tr. at\n241-42. He first was asked to explain what he meant when he stated that he had found\n\n“the physiological stress of a vaccine” can trigger the “onset of brain injury in children with mitochondrial\ndisease. . . as was the case for [A.A.] at the time of her MMR immunization.” Pet. Ex. 11, p. 162. For this\nreason, it was recommended that A.A. not receive any further vaccines until she passed “the window of\ngreatest vulnerability for brain injury,” which in children with A.A.’s “type of metabolic disorder” is six years\nof age. Id.\n\n\n                                                       73\n\f“convincing biochemical and clinical evidence for a primary or secondary mitochondrial\ndisorder.” Tr. at 242. He stated that it was a “combination of things,” including the\namino acid profile, the increased creatine kinase, the lactate level, the AST-ALT ratio,\nand the other biochemical criteria that he discussed during the hearing. Tr. at 242. In\nresponse to continued questioning, Dr. Kelley acknowledged that A.A.’s plasma lactate\nlevel was only borderline and that her struggling during the test could have been the\ncause of the elevation. Tr. at 242-45 (citing Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 4, 19). He also confirmed\nthat he viewed the AST-ALT ratio as an indirect marker. Tr. at 245.\n\n       He was then asked about his citation to the Weissman paper [Pet. Ex. 28] as\nsupport for his assertion that “a combined increase in the plasma levels of alanine and\nglycine in a child with other clinical and biochemical signs of mitochondrial dysfunction\nand regressive autism always proves on muscle biopsy to be a deficiency of Complex I\nor Complex [I and] III.” Tr. at 246. Doctor Kelley was a co-author of the article. 135 Tr. at\n247. When pressed to show where he found support in the article for his assertion, he\nstated: “I don’t believe that was in the article.” Tr. at 247. Doctor Kelley conceded that\nhis statement about muscle biopsy was supported only by his own experience and not\non anything that has been published. Tr. at 248. He explained that he has had “maybe\nbetween half a dozen and ten patients who had a muscle biopsy, who [he] tested at\nsome point, found to have that amino acid abnormality, they correlated.” Tr. at 248. He\ncontinued: “So, the N was not enormous. It’s difficult to generate large Ns in that\nsetting, but the statement holds that it correlated.” Tr. at 248.\n\n        As for the “convincing clinical evidence” of a “mitochondrial disorder,” Dr. Kelley\npointed to A.A.’s regression “under an inflammatory event,” as well as her seizures and\n“some neuromotor abnormalities that you wouldn’t expect in typical autism that may\nreflect some brain injury.” Tr. at 249-50. He stated, however, that he did not “have the\nfullest understanding of her as a patient, because that was not [his] focus. It was on the\nbiochemical testing.” Tr. at 250. Indeed, he only saw her as a patient one time. Tr. at\n250.\n\n       Doctor Kelley was also asked about the assertion in his report that A.A. “meets\nbiochemical criteria for the diagnosis of a functional Complex I deficiency”—specifically,\nto which criteria he referring. Tr. at 250. He responded that it was the “strong\ncorrelation between the amino acid profile and . . . [his] association of that with the\nmitochondrial abnormalities.” Tr. at 250-51. When asked what published criteria he\nwas looking at when he made that statement, he conceded that he “go[es] beyond what\nis published.” Tr. at 251. When pressed further, he conceded that his assertion was\nbased only on his own criteria and that he was not aware of any nationally or\ninternationally accepted criteria under which A.A. would be known to have a\n135\n    In response to my questioning, Dr. Kelley confirmed that there was a dispute among the authors\nregarding the inclusion of the paragraph discussing recent “increased concern” over “a possible causative\nrole of vaccinations in autistic children with an underlying mitochondrial cytopathy.” Tr. at 259-61 (citing\nWeissman, Pet. Ex. 28, at 4). The paragraph goes on to conclude that “[l]arge, population-based studies\nwill be needed to identify a possible relationship of vaccination with autistic regression in persons with\nmitochondrial cytopathies.” Weissman, Pet. Ex. 28, at 4.\n\n\n                                                    74\n\fmitochondrial disease. Tr. at 251-52. He stated that he does not use criteria such as\nWalker and Bernier, but guessed that “she would not meet those criteria.” 136 Tr. at 252.\n\n        Doctor Kelley was asked to what he was referring when he stated that A.A. had a\n“chronic genetic mitochondrial disorder,” since there was no evidence of a genetic\ndefect. Tr. at 252-53. He responded that the statement was based on his assessment\nof her biochemistry—“there is no explanation for that other than a genetic deficiency\nthat affects mitochondrial function.” Tr. at 252.\n\n       Finally, Dr. Kelley was asked to explain what he meant when he stated at the\nconclusion of his report that in mitochondrial autism, the injury is triggered, but the\ndisease is not. Tr. at 256. He partially answered that the injury was the regression,\nbecause “a regression that leaves the child . . . with permanent neurological deficits is a\nbrain injury.” Tr. at 256.\n\n       During another line of questioning on cross examination, Dr. Kelley was asked to\ndiscuss the significance of timing to his theory that the MMR vaccine caused A.A.’s\nregression, which he characterized as acute. Tr. at 253, 255. He stated that timing was\n“the most important thing.” Tr. at 253. He elaborated that the “sequence of events” in\nthis case were “compatible with the known . . . alterations in the inflammatory response\nthat the vaccine causes,” referring to the increase in cytokines levels. Tr. at 253-54; see\nalso Tr. at 279-81 (redirect). He was then asked what his opinion would be if the\nregression had occurred one month later, instead of one to two weeks. Tr. at 254.\nDoctor Kelley stated that “the small number of cases I know, the onset of regression\nwas . . . between seven and 14 days.” Tr. at 254. However, he claimed that the\n“cytokine response continues for a couple months,” but he could not “remember the\ndetails of the other patients to be able to say whether they continued to get worse.” Tr.\nat 254. When asked whether he would still attribute causation to the vaccine if there\nwas an intervening viral infection or ear infection, he stated that “it’s not the infection,\nper se; it’s the inflammatory response that could be used by either infection or a virus –\nor a vaccine.” Tr. at 254-55.\n\n        Doctor Kelley was questioned also about the factual predicate for his evaluation\nand subsequent opinion: that A.A. had a loss of language, visual contact, and normal\nsocial interaction within one to two weeks following her MMR vaccination. Tr. at 255.\nHe indicated (like Dr. Zimmerman had) that he relied on the history reported to him by\nA.A.’s parents and also contained in Dr. Zimmerman’s records. Tr. at 255-56. When\nfurther pressed, he conceded that there was nothing specific in the medical records to\nindicate that a regression occurred during the alleged time frame. Tr. at 256-57. He\nstated: “I accepted that information as part of my data-gathering, and in trying to figure\n\n\n136\n   On redirect examination, Dr. Kelley stated criteria such as Walker focus on “more severe” and “known”\nmitochondrial diseases. Tr. at 273-74. Consequently, he does not “find any clinical value in [his] patient\npopulation,” so he does not use them.” Tr. at 275. He stated that “most patients, like [A.A.], would not\nmeet those criteria because they’re skewed toward the severe side.” Tr. at 275; see also Tr. at 278-79.\n\n\n                                                   75\n\fout if she had a mitochondrial disease or not, I didn’t delve into the timing. I trust Dr.\nZimmerman.” Tr. at 257.\n\n       Finally, Dr. Kelley was asked on cross examination to further elaborate on why\nhe was able to attribute the MMR vaccine as the cause of the four cases of regression\nhe discussed earlier. Tr. at 257. Unfortunately, he again had difficulty providing a\nresponsive, straightforward answer:\n\n        Just as a comparison or the basis for my feeling that is – fortunately, we\n        don’t have the DPT vaccine anymore, and many years ago, when that –\n        before the – the DTaP, the acellular pertussis vaccine was available, I was\n        aware of cases of regression that occurred immediately on vaccination,\n        like [child’s first name] Poling, who had multiple vaccines and had an\n        acute inflammatory response. The cases I know where the MMR was\n        suspected to be the cause, the timing was – the timing parallels the\n        cytokine – the established – the known cytokine profile. So, that’s like a\n        normal – like a natural infection, and the immune response builds over a\n        period of time. And we understand from the – what effect the\n        inflammatory response has on mitochondria, that it’s the cytokine\n        response – the cytokine profile, the cytokine response of an infection that\n        determines whether or not it will impair mitochondrial function. So, you will\n        not expect a regression to occur with an MMR vaccine in the first few\n        days, unless it w[as] given with another vaccine.\n\nTr. at 257-58. In response to follow-up questions, Dr. Kelley agreed that it was the\ntiming that was most persuasive to him. Tr. at 258; see also Tr. at 285 (redirect). When\nasked if he would ever consider a regression in such circumstance to be coincidental,\nhe responded that he would, but only if there had been another inflammatory event. Tr.\nat 258. He stated, however, that he would not be able to differentiate between\ninflammatory events, so it would still depend on timing. 137 Tr. at 258-59.\n\n        I asked Dr. Kelley to clarify whether he considered regression to be a brain injury.\nTr. at 261. He responded that an acute regression “can be a brain injury or it can be a\nbrain disturbance”—if the child does not recover, then it is a brain injury. Tr. at 261; see\nalso Tr. at 256 (cross). I also asked to clarify whether, in his view, a regression could\noccur without any inciting agent. Tr. at 261-63. In response, he seemed to indicate that\na “stressor” is necessary. Tr. at 261-63. He stated that regressions do not “come out of\nthe blue,” it is just “that we are not always able to identify what the stressor is.” Tr. at\n262.\n\n\n\n137\n   In response to my questioning on this topic, Dr. Kelley elaborated that if there “were another illness\nthat caused an inflammatory response, which probably would increase TNF-alpha, then, yes, if there\nwere another illness superimposed on that time window, then, indeed, one could not separate the two,\nbecause it’s not specific.” Tr. at 268.\n\n\n                                                     76\n\f       In response to my further questioning, Dr. Kelley agreed that it was his view that\n“almost all regressive autism . . . [is] associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.” Tr. at\n269. After further discussion, I questioned whether he was aware of any epidemiologic\nstudy of regression in autism and mitochondrial disorders that has equated all or most\nregression to a mitochondrial problem. Tr. at 271. He responded “no,” and then\nexplained “there are articles that say a child has autism and mitochondrial disease, but\nunfortunately, . . . not all papers separate out one from the other,” and “they are usually\nnot segregated into regressive versus nonregressive.” Tr. at 271; see also Tr. at 281-\n82. He commented that he had planned to do such a study. Tr. at 271-72.\n\n       I then tried to have Dr. Kelley discuss several articles he submitted in support of\nhis theory that inflammation from the MMR vaccine caused or contributed to A.A.’s\nregression. Tr. at 264-68. 138 After an unfruitful attempt to elicit how each article related\nto A.A.’s case, Dr. Kelley stated:\n\n        Yeah, I guess it’s not that I would cite to a particular article for – in [A.A.’s]\n        case. The – I have – one has to look at the larger picture. I have a – a\n        common phenomenon that I see in – as regressive autism – associated\n        with regressive autism in mitochondrial disease, and searching for\n        explanations for that, then I come upon data that talks about cytokine\n        response. So, I can’t – what is most convincing to me in terms of the\n        pathophysiology is TNF-alpha, but it is mostly the fact that the – for\n        [A.A.’s] case in particular, it’s not so much that – it’s the simple\n        observation that a vaccine is designed to cause an inflammatory\n        response, and the timing of that inflammatory response is different in a\n        DPT vaccine. That’s all it is.”\n\nTr. at 267-68.\n\n        At the conclusion of Dr. Kelley’s testimony, I stated that over the years I have\nheard testimony from many different clinicians about various different treatments\npurported to improve autism—from secretin to chelation to methylcobalamin injections.\nTr. at 668. I confessed that some of his testimony seemed in a similar vein. Tr. at 668.\nDoctor Kelley responded that his testimony should be credited based on his 25 years of\nexperience “running a laboratory that’s considered an international standard for this kind\nof work,” his credentials, and the fact that he had given me “hard data, not just clinical\nobservation.” Tr. at 668-69. He expressed significant frustration over the difficulty he\nhas encountered in publishing his methodology. Tr. at 669-72. He stated that he “fully\nappreciate[d my] skepticism because a lot of [his] colleagues feel that . . . you can’t treat\na mitochondrial problem.” Tr. at 671. He concluded: “I’m a clinician and I can see my\npatients getting better on these treatments.” Tr. at 672. This statement conflicted with\n138\n   The articles were: Poland, Pet. Ex. 71; A.

Doctor Wiznitzer.\n\n       In his expert report, Dr. Wiznitzer opined that there was no support in the\ncontemporaneous records for the alleged association, either causal or aggravating,\nbetween A.A.’s MMR vaccination and the occurrence of her ASD. Pet. Ex. K at 13.\nRather, the evidence showed a developmental path consistent with ASD. Id. (citing R.\nLanda, Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life, NAT. CLIN.\nPRACT. NEUROL., 4: 138-47 (2008), filed as Res. Ex. O [hereinafter “Landa, Res. Ex.\nO”]). Of particular significance to his opinion was A.A.’s apparent language delay—an\nearly manifestation of ASD—and the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence\nfor a sudden regression following vaccination. Id.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer thought Dr. Kelley’s causation opinion was inconsistent with the\nevidence. Pet. Ex. K at 14. In his view, A.A.’s mild language delay meant that she\neither did not have the mitochondrial dysfunction Dr. Kelley claimed, or its onset was\nprior to October 23, with a subacute evolution already present on that date. Id. at 14.\nHe did not see an abrupt worsening of A.A.’s language. Id. at 14. Additionally, he\nfound Dr. Kelley’s opinion on the temporal relationship between A.A.’s vaccination and\nthe onset of her ASD to be “purely speculative.” Id. at 14. In his opinion, Dr. Kelley\nfailed to account for the initial history of regression following A.A.’s ear infections.\nDoctor Kelley simply ignored multiple published studies that found no association\nbetween the MMR vaccine and autism, “including regressive autism.” Id. at 14 (citing\nInstitute of Medicine, IMMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW : VACCINES AND AUTISM (2004), filed\nas Res. Ex. P [hereinafter “2004 IOM Report, Res. Ex. P”], at 65-126.; T. Uchiyama, et\nal., MMR-vaccine and regression in autism spectrum disorders: negative results\npresented from Japan, J. AUTISM DEV.

Ex. S\n[hereinafter “Uno, Res. Ex. S”]).\n\n       At hearing, Dr. Wiznitzer testified, consistent with his expert report, that there\nwas no evidence that A.A. regressed within one to two weeks after receiving the MMR\nvaccine or that the vaccine played any role in her developmental disabilities. Tr. at 485.\nRather, her developmental trajectory changed by her 15-month checkup—something\nthat the MMR vaccination neither caused nor aggravated. Tr. at 485-87, 515-17.\n\n\n\n\n                                            78\n\f       Doctor Wiznitzer began by explaining that the typical 15-month-old possesses\none to three words for speech, 139 which are “above and beyond any kind of imitations\nand sounds that [the parent] might do.” Tr. at 486. Additionally, such children have\nbegun to walk, are “finger feeding,” can wave goodbye, are interested in peekaboo and\npat-a-cake games, can play with cause-and-effect toys, and have started to stack\nblocks. Tr. at 485. They also will reliably turn when called by name and can sometimes\nfollow simple one-step commands. Tr. at 486.\n\n        Based on his review of the available records, Dr. Wiznitzer testified that A.A. had\nnormal development during her first year and attained some of these milestones. Tr. at\n485. However, by the time of her 15-month checkup, her developmental trajectory had\nchanged and an apparent speech delay was present. Tr. at 486; see also Tr. at 610-11\n(court examination). Indeed, it was his opinion that A.A.’s speech development was\nlikely delayed even at her one-year checkup. He noted that although she reportedly\nhad one to three words at that time, multiple later records indicated that she only “made\nanimal sounds and maybe had one word” at that point. Tr. at 486; compare, e.g., Pet.\nEx. 9, p. 10 (“says 1-3 words”) with Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5 (“said her first word ‘Quack’ at 1 year\nand speaking a little more/using animal sounds at 15 months”). He also saw evidence\nof language delay in the October 14 video recorded prior to her vaccination. In video\nsegments taken at home, he observed that A.A. vocalized but used no words, including\n“ma-ma and da-da”—even though her parents were present. Tr. at 487 . He questioned\nwhether A.A. was using these words with specificity, meaning that when she said “ma-\nma,” she did so in reference to her mother. She said no words during her visit to the\npumpkin patch later that same day. Tr. at 480-90.\n\n      Additionally, Dr. Wiznitzer saw some “subtle” differences in her behavior from\nwhat would normally be expected from a developmental standpoint. Tr. at 487. For\nexample, in the video she never raised her hands to be picked up from her crib, and\nwhen she stopped to look at a favorite stuffed animal, she flapped her hands—a motor\nmannerism or “stereotypy” commonly seen in autistic individuals and noted in later\nrecords by Dr. Zimmerman. 140 Tr. at 487-88; see Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n\n\n139\n   In his expert report, he stated that at 15 months, “a child typically has 3-5 words and mature jargon\nwith real words.” Res. Ex. K at 13.\n140\n    On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman stated that he did not agree with Dr. Wiznitzer that A.A. exhibited hand-\nflapping in the video. Tr. at 676. He viewed the behavior as “normal movements with excitement for a\nchild that age.” Id. He stated that there were “some repetitive movements – arm movements such as\nwhen she was holding a couple of glass coasters and banging them together, but she did not have hand\nflapping.” Id. He explained that “there is a fairly typical progression” in ASD—a “hierarchy of symptoms.”\nId. At onset there is “the loss of language and social skills,” which is followed by “the repetitive\nmovements, the circling behaviors and the hand flapping and jumping.” Id. He stated that the behaviors\nin the video were “not like that and [he] would not have expected them” at that point. Id. It is unclear why\nhe thought that the repetitive movements he identified in the video (i.e., banging coasters) were normal as\nopposed to repetitive movements falling within the hierarchy of symptoms. Dr. Zimmerman later testified\nthat stereotypies, including repetitive behaviors, hand flapping, and circling movements, can present\nbefore the loss of language, “but this would be very unusual.” Tr. at 681 (recross).\n\n\n                                                    79\n\f        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer acknowledged that A.A. was interactive with\nher parents in the October 14 video, but he found the quality and level of her interaction\nto be mildly diminished. Tr. at 529. For instance, although she was seen handing her\nmother a toy, running back and forth around the house, and making eye contact (at\nleast with the camera), she did not hug her parents or raise her hands to be picked up.\nTr. at 529. He stated that the real question was whether this was the type of interaction\n“normally expected . . . or was it mildly diminished as we see in some of the studies\n[where] children gradually evolve into the autistic clinical picture.” Tr. at 529-30.\n\n         In his view, A.A.’s lack of spoken functional words, 141 her disinterest in being\nlifted from her crib, and her distinctive motor mannerisms, were indicative of existing\ndevelopmental problems and early signs of autism. Tr. at 488-89; see also Tr. at 500-\n01 (direct); 603-04 (court examination). As a consequence, Dr. Wiznitzer disagreed\nwith Dr. Zimmerman that A.A. was developmentally normal on October 14, a few days\nbefore her vaccination. Tr. at 486-87.\n\n        With regard to A.A.’s post-vaccination condition, Dr. Wiznitzer stated that nothing\nin the contemporaneous medical evidence reflected an adverse vaccine reaction or an\nabrupt deterioration of her development. 142 Tr. at 491. Indeed, A.A. did not have a\nreturn medical visit for nearly two months, until December 18, when she was treated for\na respiratory infection and ear infection. Tr. at 496. Nothing in the record from that visit\nreferenced any loss of skills or other significant change. Tr. at 496-97 (citing Pet. Ex. 9,\np. 59). Doctor Wiznitzer viewed this as a clear indication that the vaccine had no\nadverse impact on A.A.’s health or development. He stated that in his experience,\nwhen parents see something different in their child, they come in for an office visit and\nbring up the problem. He was confident “that if there was a concern . . . going on at that\ntime, it would have been identified.” Tr. at 496-97.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer noted that another opportunity to identify an adverse reaction\nwas on April 2, 2001, when A.A. visited her doctor and received additional vaccinations.\nTr. at 515; see Pet. Ex. 9, p. 1. He explained that physicians typically ask parents about\nproblems with prior vaccinations before they administer others, and will document the\nparents’ response. Tr. at 515-16. Nothing was noted in A.A.’s record about an adverse\nreaction following her October 23 vaccination. Neither was anything noted when she\nvisited her doctor a month earlier, in March 2001. Tr. at 516; see Pet. Ex. 9, pp. 8, 18,\n56. Doctor Wiznitzer also found no documentation of any phone calls from A.A.’s\nparents reporting a fever or similar concern, which was curious since they did not\nhesitate to contact the physician and bring her in for an appointment at other times\nwhen she had fever or was ill. Tr. at 516.\n141\n    Doctor Wiznitzer distinguished functional words from “just repeating animal sounds” or “holding up a\nfinger” to show one’s age. To illustrate his point, he noted a clip from the video that showed A.A.\nresponding to the question of her age with the incorrect script—she answered with the “how big” gesture,\nrather than the raised finger. Tr. at 488-89; see also Tr. at 603-04 (cross).\n142\n   He noted that even records created months after the vaccination contained no notations regarding\nregression. Tr. at 491.\n\n\n                                                   80\n\f       Doctor Wiznitzer likewise found no indication in the contemporaneous records\nthat A.A. had a speech regression within two weeks of her vaccination. Tr. at 493. He\nexplained that speech regression 143 in autism is the loss of between three and five\nfunctional words—words “that the child is using for functional purposes [and] have\npersisted for at least one month.” Tr. at 492. He emphasized that such words are in\naddition to “the specific ma-ma and da-da.” 144 Tr. at 492. Based on the evidence, he\nwas doubtful that A.A. had three to five functional words to lose. 145 Tr. at 523, 552.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer challenged Ms. Edick’s assertion that “a 15-\nmonth old has a vocabulary of 10 to 24 words” as an incorrect statement—“[a] special\neducation teacher shouldn’t say that.”146 Tr. at 535. Doctor Wiznitzer explained that it\nwould be “highly, highly unlikely” for a child that age to have such a vocabulary due to\nthe way language develops and also “the immaturity of the oral motor mechanism in\nterms of verbalization.” Tr. at 535-36. He stated that in his many years of practice he\ncould not recall ever meeting a child who had 24 words at 15 months of age—\n“functional words that they use independently.” Tr. at 536.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer also reviewed and discussed the October 29 video taken at the\nHalloween event, which allegedly showed significant post-vaccination behavioral\nchanges. Contrary to petitioners’ view, he saw no evidence in the video of the alleged\nregression, or any other significant behavioral issues. Tr. at 493, 495. For an\nequivalent comparison, he focused on A.A.’s behavior at the pumpkin patch on October\n14 because both were “shot basically in the same environment.” Tr. at 493. Her\nbehavior on the two occasions was strikingly similar. Tr. at 495. At the pumpkin patch,\nfor instance, she barely vocalized and seemed uncomfortable with her surroundings,\nalthough she did engage in some limited exploration. Tr. at 490, 531. Likewise, at the\nHalloween event, she was quiet and appeared unsettled with the “hubbub” and\ncommotion of the crowd. Tr. at 494. Doctor Wiznitzer also noted that she responded to\n143\n   Doctor Wiznitzer explained that speech regression is different from speech delay. The latter “is failure\nto have adequate language development[.] . . . It’s not that you’ve lost words; it’s that [language] does not\ndevelop the way it should.” Tr. at 492. To illustrate his point, he described “children with speech delay\nwho may have some word utterances for a few days and then lose those words.” Tr. at 493. Such an\nevent is not speech regression; instead it is an instance of someone having taught the child to repeat\ncertain words, but because they held no functional purpose, they faded. Tr. at 493.\n144\n  Doctor Wiznitzer explained that “ma-ma” and “da-da” are excluded because parents can “confuse[] the\nnonspecific babble with the specific terms.” Tr. at 492.\n145\n  On redirect, Dr. Zimmerman stated that he disagreed that A.A. had no functional words to lose—she\nhad “moo.” Tr. at 677.\n146\n   As a school-based special education teacher, Ms. Edick would not have much contact with children\nunder the age of three in a teacher-student setting. Early intervention programs provide treatment for\nchildren with developmental delays and neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD up to three years of\nage. At that point, the children transition to services provided through the school system. A.A. similarly\ntransitioned to school-based programs at three years of age. Tr. at 87, 89, 548; Pet. Ex. 7, p. 10.\n(preschool at Village Green Day School in the fall of 2001).\n\n\n                                                     81\n\fher name on both occasions, although inconsistently. 147 Tr. at 532; see also Tr. at 611-\n12.\n\n       However, Dr. Wiznitzer saw “a clear difference” in her behavior and social\ninteractions when she was in the familiar surroundings of home as compared to outside\nin public. Tr. at 490; see also Tr. at 604-05 (court examination). For instance, as seen\nin the October 14 video clips taken at home, A.A. comfortably babbled, laughed, and\ninteracted with her parents; whereas later that same day, at the pumpkin patch, she\nvocalized very little and was much less active. Tr. at 490, 533. He explained that such\nreticent behavior was not unusual or necessarily concerning from a developmental\nstandpoint, as children at this age often feel “stranger anxiety” and vary in the time\nneeded to acclimate to a given situation. Tr. at 490. Available medical records\n“described her as shy, suggesting that she required a bit more time to acclimate in\ncomparison to the average child.” Tr. at 490-91. According to Dr. Wiznitzer, what was\nimportant from a developmental perspective was A.A.’s evident awareness of her\nsurroundings and the people around her—she was just “a bit overwhelmed by what\n[was] going on.” Tr. at 494, 533.\n\n        In response to my questions, Dr. Wiznitzer discussed the video clips taken\nbetween Christmas Day and December 30. Tr. at 605-08. He stated that by\nChristmastime “there was clearly a change.” Tr. at 606. He observed that she was not\nmaking good eye contact; she was not vocalizing; and she had decreased interaction.\nTr. at 605. She was also “still doing some cause/effect play,” but it was less than the\nplay seen in the October 14 video. Tr. at 605. He even observed a difference between\nthe October 29 video and the Christmas Day video, noting that on the earlier occasion\nshe “did the appropriate thing” with the beanbag game—put the beanbag through the\nhole—whereas on Christmas she had no real interest in the toys and was seen flicking\na string instead. Tr. at 606. Doctor Wiznitzer, however, was unable to state, based on\nthe videos alone, that there was a continuum of deterioration between October and\nDecember. Tr. at 608. This was because the videos were shot in different\nenvironments. Tr. at 608.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was questioned further about the timeline of\nA.A.’s autistic presentation. Tr. at 541-49. He agreed that “around Christmastime” it\nbecame clear that there was “something not right” about A.A.’s behavior. Tr. 541-42.\nHe also agreed with the basic timeline of events thereafter leading up to her formal\ndiagnosis; however, he disputed that it took 15 months for her to receive a diagnosis.\nTr. at 549. Rather, he calculated that nine months elapsed between her Christmastime\nbehavior and Dr. Lavenstein’s note that she had “autistic symptomology.” Tr. at 549\n(citing Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96).\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer was also questioned about Ms. Edick’s testimony concerning\nA.A.’s behavior on Veterans’ Day weekend. Tr. at 537-41. He found it difficult to place\n\n147\n  Doctor Wiznitzer explained that A.A.’s inconsistency in responding to her name was typical “kiddie\nbehavior.” Tr. at 611. However, if that behavior was consistent, it would be a “red flag.” Id.\n\n\n                                                   82\n\fsignificant weight on her recollections, as the events she described occurred many\nyears earlier and were uncorroborated by any independent documentation. Tr. at 537-\n38, 540. He indicated that he did not doubt Ms. Edick’s observations, but whether they\noccurred at the times she remembered them occurring. Tr. at 538-41. He explained\nthat in his clinical experience, when patients relate a history they will often be more\naccurate when the event is close in time. Tr. at 538-39. As time passes, “there can be\nsome distortion of the information either in terms of telescoping, putting it into a different\ntime zone, or not necessarily appreciating some of the important facts or points that\nwere there.” Tr. at 539; see also Tr. at 614-16 (court examination).\n\n        In his view, A.A.’s abnormalities in speech and behavior were present prior to her\nvaccination and were early signs of autism. Tr. at 500-01. Doctor Wiznitzer explained\nthat autism spectrum disorder is a “neurodevelopmental condition that impacts\nadversely on socialization and social communication and has associated restrictiveness\nand repetitive behaviors with onset in the early childhood years.” Tr. at 497. He stated\nthat “presentation is usually between age one and two years,” but symptoms are always\npresent before age three years. Tr. at 497. Although presentation varies, speech delay\nis the “most common” complaint from parents. Tr. at 497-98. Other symptoms include\ndecreased eye contact and changes in social behavior. Tr. at 498.\n\n         Doctor Wiznitzer then described three common ASD presentation types. In one\ngroup, the symptoms are not obvious at the time, but are apparent in retrospect. Tr. at\n498. In such cases, parents often begin to see differences between the functioning of\ntheir child and that of their child’s normal peers, especially in the area of language\ndevelopment. Tr. at 498. When these parents look back, they realize that their child\nhas been symptomatic from early- to mid-infancy. Tr. at 498. In a second group, the\nchildren seem to be functioning “at or near normal for about the first year to two years of\nlife, [but] then [undergo] a stagnation of their development”—they “don’t seem to move\nto the next developmental level.” Tr. at 498. Such children might, for example, fail to\ntransition from the “sociability stage, which is like smiling . . . at people, having some\ninterest in looking at them, to more active interactions and interventions, in going up to\nthem.” Tr. at 498. The third group consists of children who “appear to have normal\ndevelopmental progression and then actually have a true regression of skills.” Tr. at\n499. In those children, the regression “could first start as a speech regression, but\nquickly gets linked with a speech and social skills regression.” Tr. at 499.\n\n       In response to my questions, Dr. Wiznitzer elaborated that regression in autism is\nnot an abrupt occurrence. Tr. at 597-602. He explained that the loss of language and\nsocial skills typically “evolve[s] over a period of weeks to a period of months.”148 Tr. at\n600-01. He stated that “an overnight story” would lead him to “start looking for other\ndisorders.” Tr. at 601.\n\n\n148\n   Doctor Wiznitzer defined a “gradual onset” as taking months, and an “abrupt onset” as taking weeks.\nTr. at 601. He stated that the loss of skills is usually gradual—over a period of “a month or two.” Tr. at\n602.\n\n\n                                                    83\n\f        Doctor Wiznitzer agreed with A.A.’s ASD diagnosis, which he found supported by\nthe records. Tr. at 499. He elaborated that the “records in 2001 and afterwards clearly\ntell us that she has . . . features consistent with that diagnosis. She has . . . impairment\nin socialization, and impairment in pragmatic skills, [and] impairment in social\ncommunication.” Tr. at 499. Repeatedly, she met the diagnostic criteria for ASD in\nestablished rating scales. Tr. at 499.\n\n        According to Dr. Wiznitzer, A.A.’s autistic presentation was not atypical; it fell\nwithin the expected range. Tr. at 500. Moreover, even “a relatively rapid regression”—\nwhich was not shown—would still be “within the framework of what’s been described for\nthe population.” Tr. at 500.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer discussed potential causes of autism, including whether\nvaccines are known to play a role. He explained that the disorder is biologically based,\nwith “a strong genetic component.” Tr. at 501. The “vast majority have or will be shown\nto have underlying genetic problems with genes that influence brain development.” 149\nTr. at 501. Others can be affected by “insults to the brain prenatally, perhaps due to\nsome toxic agent,” such as valproate or excessive alcohol exposure. Tr. at 501.\nPrematurity has also been described, although it is yet unclear whether it is the\nprematurity itself or some gene abnormality that is responsible for the autistic\nphenotype 150 in such children. Tr. at 501. He acknowledged the association between\nprimary mitochondrial disease and ASD, which has been reported in the literature, but\nstated that there is no known connection between vaccination and autism. Tr. at 502-\n03. Ultimately, the underlying cause of ASD is not always known. Tr. at 501.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer then addressed Dr. Kelley’s theory that the MMR vaccine\ncauses a TNF-α-mediated inflammatory response, which can lead to autistic regression\nin individuals with mitochondrial abnormalities. Tr. at 503. Of importance to Dr.\nWiznitzer were two articles cited by Dr. Kelley as support for this theory. The first study\nexamined the immune response related to immunosuppression in subjects vaccinated\nwith live attenuated rubella vaccine. A. Pukhalsky, et al., Cytokine profile after rubella\nvaccine inoculation; evidence of the immunosuppressive effect of vaccination, MEDIAT.\nINFLAMM., 12 (4): 203-07 (2003), filed as Pet. Ex. 54 [hereinafter “Pukhalsky, Pet. Ex.\n54”]. The second study focused on the cytokine production profile of children following\nthe first and second doses of the measles vaccine. Poland, Pet. Ex. 71. In his view,\nneither article supported Dr. Kelley’s hypothesis regarding the inflammatory effect of\nvaccines. Tr. at 506, 510.\n\n      With regard to the Pukhalsky article, Dr. Wiznitzer first commented on its title,\nwhich he noted “does not say immune-inflammatory effect but immunosuppressive\n\n\n\n149\n      He recalled Dr. Zimmerman’s testimony regarding synaptic development as an example. Tr. at 501.\n150\n      Doctor Wiznitzer defined “phenotype” as “the clinical picture.” Tr. at 502.\n\n\n                                                        84\n\feffect.” Tr. at 504. He explained that cytokines 151 have a “variety of jobs” and not all\nare pro-inflammatory. 152 Tr. at 504, 593. In this study, the researchers analyzed the\nlevels of certain cytokines following vaccination, including interleukin (IL)-4, tumor\nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-10. Their results showed that IL-4\nlevels remained essentially the same seven days after vaccine inoculation—they were\n“no different than . . . at baseline.” Tr. at 504-05 (citing Fig. 2). Their results also\nshowed the interplay between IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) and TNF-α (a pro-\ninflammatory cytokine). Tr. at 505 (citing Fig. 3). The researchers found that, at seven\ndays post-vaccination, there was “no significant rise in the TNF-[α] value, which means\nthere should be no increased risk of inflammation compared to baseline.” Tr. at 505.\nThere was, however, a significant rise in IL-10, which suggested that “at that time [there]\nmay [have been] a bit more anti-inflammation compared to inflammation.” Tr. at 505.\nAnd then “at 30 days out, basically there’s much more anti-inflammation compared to\ninflammation, which is why the article [was titled] the immunosuppressive effect.” Tr. at\n505-06. He concluded that the article did “not support Dr. Kelley’s hypothesis that\nwithin one to two weeks there is a significant rise in TNF-alpha.” Tr. at 506. “[I]n fact,\nyou can make an argument that this article tells us that the rise in IL-10 would actually\ntame the inflammatory process.” Tr. at 506.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer then discussed the Poland article, which also examined\ncytokine levels following vaccination. Tr. at 506-10; see also Tr. at 588-95 (cross). The\nstudy analyzed cytokine secretion and plasma levels of six cytokines in two groups of\nchildren following measles vaccination. The first group consisted of 12-15 month-old\ntoddlers receiving their first measles vaccination, and the second group was composed\nof children aged 4-12 years receiving a second dose. Measurements were taken prior\nto vaccination to obtain a baseline and then at regular intervals thereafter, to 40 days.\nTr. at 507. Doctor Wiznitzer focused on the results of the first group because the\nchildren were analogous to A.A. in age and circumstance (i.e., first dose of a vaccine).\nTr. at 508. He began with figure 1(A), 153 which showed that for the first 15 days\nfollowing vaccination—the critical time period according to Dr. Kelley—none of the\n\n151\n   Cytokine is “a generic term for non-antibody proteins released by one cell population (e.g., primed T\nlymphocytes) on contact with specific antigen, which act as intercellular mediators, as in the generation of\nan immune response.” DORLAND’S at 466.\n152\n   According to Dr. Wiznitzer, “Dr. Kelley represented IL-4 as a pro-inflammatory substance.” Tr. at 594.\nPetitioners’ counsel disagreed with his recollection. Id. In his testimony, Dr. Kelley grouped IL-4 with\n“dozens” of other “factors that will be sent out” in response to infection, including IL-6 and TNF-α. Tr. at\n219. During this portion of testimony, Dr. Kelley went on to discuss how various studies have “shown\nwhat the cytokine response is in this infection or that immunization,” but stated “correlations have not\nbeen made as to . . . what combination of cytokines are most likely to impair mitochondrial function.” Tr.\nat 219. Although he did not specifically identify IL-4 as “pro-inflammatory,” his comments implied that he\nviewed IL-4 as such, and are thus illustrative of the challenges posed by his imprecise and rambling\ntestimony.\n153\n    Doctor Wiznitzer explained that the results shown in figure 1(A) were obtained from white blood cells\nthat were secreting cytokines. Tr. at 594-95. The researchers then “took the supernatant, which is the\nfluid around the cells, and analyzed it for concentration of the cytokines.” Tr. at 595.\n\n\n                                                     85\n\fvalues for IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-α secretion rose above their baseline. 154 Tr. at 508. “In\nfact, at two weeks afterwards, IL-6 and . . . TNF-alpha [fell] below their baseline values\n[, and] IL-4 basically [did not] change to any significance.” Tr. at 508; see also Tr. at\n590-94 (cross). Similarly, the values in figure 2(A), which reflected plasma cytokine\nlevels at regular intervals, remained fairly steady. Tr. at 509. Specifically, there was no\nappreciable change in the blood levels of IL-6 and TNF-α over time, and IL-4 fluctuated\nup and down. Tr. at 509-10. He noted that “the paper itself state[d] that there was no\nappreciable change in the cytokine levels” for the toddler group. Tr. at 510.\n\n       In summary, Dr. Wiznitzer stated that “the two articles that Dr. Kelley brought to\nthe Court and cited do not support his proposition that IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-alpha levels in\nthe blood or in cell culture rise within two weeks of a vaccination, which means that that\ncan’t be the mechanism of this purported injury.” Tr. at 510.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer also expressed significant concerns with the “very unclear”\nmethodology Dr. Kelley used to interpret A.A.’s amino acid test results. Tr. at 510. He\ndirected attention to Pet. Ex. 23A, the spreadsheet summary of A.A.’s amino acid\nprofile, which Dr. Kelley used to show that A.A. met the biochemical criteria for a\nfunctional complex I deficiency diagnosis. Tr. at 511. His first concern related to the\ncalculation of the range and mean values. Doctor Wiznitzer stated that it appeared,\nbased on his own calculations, that Dr. Kelley had taken the minimum range value plus\nthe maximum range value and divided by two, “which means [that] his lab . . . has a\nperfect bell-shaped curve of data.” Tr. at 511. He stated that this “only happens in\narticles and problems that are given to students . . . . In the real world, there’s always\neither a shift to the right or a little . . . shift to the left. You’re not exactly in the middle\nevery single time.” Tr. at 511. He further noted that Dr. Kelley’s sample size was 100,\nwhich is too small to obtain a perfect bell curve. Tr. at 513.\n\n        His second concern related to the “normalized ratios to mean normal,” which was\nnoted on the spreadsheet as “0.8 to 1.2.” Tr. at 513. Doctor Wiznitzer stated that Dr.\nKelley again “doesn’t tell us how that normal was calculated. He basically says trust\nme; that’s because I found it to be this way.” Tr. at 513. Doctor Wiznitzer then\nperformed an example calculation using the values shown for the amino acid taurine.\nTr. at 513. He explained that the resulting value would be considered “an outlier in this\npopulation, but yet it’s still within the normal range”—an unusual outcome. Tr. at 513.\nHe also took issue with Dr. Kelley’s apparent comfort with standard deviations as great\nas 11. 155 Tr. at 513-14. The standard deviation for a normal range is usually “plus or\nminus two standard deviations.” Tr. at 514.\n154\n   On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was asked whether the cytokine fluctuations that occurred\nbetween day zero and day 15, as shown in figure 1(A), were indicative of inflammation. Tr. at 591-94.\nHe explained that although the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α fluctuated, they returned to baseline—and\n“baseline is not inflammation.” Tr. at 594.\n155\n  Doctor Wiznitzer recalled Dr. Kelley’s statement that “one of his lab values was 11 standard deviations\nabove the mean.” Tr. at 513-14 (see Tr. at 181). He found “it extremely hard to believe that any of these\nnumbers are 11 standard deviations above the mean. That is an astronomically high number.” Tr. at\n514.\n\n\n                                                   86\n\f       Doctor Wiznitzer’s final concern related to the application of Dr. Kelley’s normal\nrange values to the test results from other labs. Tr. at 514. He cautioned that Dr.\nKelley’s assumption that the other labs’ numbers were derived from historical data could\nbe mistaken. Tr. at 514. In addition to fluctuations in testing between labs, the other\nlabs could also have established their own normal ranges. Tr. at 514. So applying the\nvalues as he has done “can be fraught with problems.” Tr. at 514.\n\n        As a consequence of these concerns, Dr. Wiznitzer found it difficult to “state that\nthis information has any value.” Tr. at 515. Without knowing “where these numbers\ncame from,” the validity of the values and resulting conclusions are completely suspect.\nTr. at 515. “There’s a lot of unanswered questions here . . . [a]nd those are only some\nof them.” Tr. at 515.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer confirmed that he does not evaluate or\ndiagnose mitochondrial disorders, but instead refers patients to colleagues who are\nmitochondrial specialists. Tr. at 549-50. He discussed the factors or clinical\npresentations which would lead him to provide a referral for a mitochondrial evaluation.\nTr. at 550-51. He stated that he would likely refer for “unexplained lactic acidosis;\nunexplained multi-organ system disease; neuro-imaging abnormalities that could be\nconsistent with a mitochondrial disorder, such as abnormal signal from the basil ganglia\nand white matter; abnormalities in amino acid metabolism, especially significantly\nelevated alanine; [and] intractable epilepsy that’s not explainable.” Tr. at 550. He\nwould also refer for unexplained developmental delay and global regression, which he\ndefined as regression in all skills. 156 Tr. at 552.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer typically would not refer an autistic child for a mitochondrial\nevaluation. Tr. at 554. He explained that he would look to standardized guidelines on\nthe evaluation of children with autism. Tr. at 555-56. At a minimum he would order a\nchromosome micro array, a DNA test for fragile X syndrome, and a test for Rett\nsyndrome (if the child was female). Tr. at 556. Then he would “look at the rest of the\nclinical scenario. So, if I have a child who clearly has a history of regression, I then start\nlooking for potential underlying metabolic problems. And then I’ll do the metabolic\ntesting. But I don’t do it for every child. That is not what’s recommended in the\nguidelines.” Tr. at 556. Dr. Wiznitzer stated that has “had children who present with\nautistic regression, clear-cut history of autistic regression, well-documented history of\nautistic regression. And I have done the full workup, which includes the metabolic\nworkup.” Tr. at 557. “I do that on a regular basis.” Tr. at 557.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was questioned about his heavy reliance on\ncontemporaneous medical records and asked whether he had “totally discounted” the\nstatements made by A.A.’s parents and aunt. Tr. at 521. Doctor Wiznitzer responded\nthat he “never discount[ed] anything,” but tried to place it in context. Tr. at 521. In his\n\n156\n   Doctor Wiznitzer disagreed that A.A. had a global regression. Tr. at 552. Rather, it was his opinion\nthat she had a social regression consistent with autism. Tr. at 552.\n\n\n                                                   87\n\fview, statements made about unmemorable events many years earlier must be afforded\nless weight than contemporaneous accounts documented in the record. Tr. at 520. For\nexample, with regard to A.A.’s alleged post-vaccination fever, he found it difficult to\nbelieve that her parents would not have reported it to her primary care provider when it\noccurred—especially when they did not previously hesitate to contact her physician for\nsuch matters. Tr. at 520. He expressed similar reservations “about the whole scenario,\nfever, speech regression, social regression, motor regression. These are serious\nproblems, and I don’t see [them] reflected in the medical records at all.” Tr. at 521. I\nnote that I was unable to note any contemporaneous medical record or history provided\nclose in time to the period of alleged regression that reflected a loss of motor skills,\nnotwithstanding Mr. Allen’s testimony about A.A. crawling more than walking at one\npoint after the vaccination. It was clear from his testimony that she had not lost the\nability to walk at any point.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer was also cross-examined about A.A.’s post-vaccination\nregression. He reiterated that he had fully considered the statements and testimony of\nA.A.’s parents and aunt, but found them largely unsupported by the record. Tr. at 521-\n23. With regard to A.A.’s alleged regression of speech, he emphasized that based on\nthe available records, “there was no speech to be lost.” Tr. at 523. He noted that Dr.\nLavenstein’s initial report, for example, indicated that A.A. may have had some oral\nsounds but then subsequently regressed. Tr. at 523 (citing Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96 (primitive\nspeech)). “That’s not a speech regression; that’s oral sounds. And even Dr. Lavenstein\ndocumented that she had no words. You can’t have a speech regression if you have no\nwords.” Tr. at 523. Doctor Wiznitzer acknowledged that Dr. Lavenstein used the term\n“regression” for the loss of oral sounds, but emphasized that the “true definition of\nspeech is not primitive sounds, it’s not babbling.” Tr. at 524, 553.\n\n       In response to additional questioning, Dr. Wiznitzer reviewed the medical record\nof A.A.’s one-year checkup, which indicated she said “1-3 words.” Tr. at 524 (citing Pet.\nEx. 9, p. 10). He acknowledged what the record reflected, but explained that a checked\nbox is not that informative. For instance, “we don’t know what those words were, we\ndon’t know how long they persisted, [and] we don’t know if they lasted for more than a\nmonth, which is the criteria you need to use.” Tr. at 525. Unfortunately, “[a]ll it says\nhere is that she had words. There’s no documentation of anything else.” Tr. at 525.\nDoctor Wiznitzer saw this as an example of a “superficial” history, which failed to get to\n“the core information” because the clinician did not “dig deeper” and ask more than\nroutine questions. Tr. at 525-26. He confessed that it can be difficult in the clinical\nsetting to get good, detailed histories about language; however, they are vitally\nimportant, which is why the Autism Diagnostic Interview, 157 for example, asks such in-\ndepth questions. Tr. at 528.\n\n\n157\n   The Autism Diagnostic Interview is a testing instrument used in “diagnosing autism, planning\ntreatment, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders.” See WPS (publisher),\nhttp://www.wpspublish.com/store/p/2645/autism-diagnostic-interview-revised-adi-r (last visited Sept. 10,\n2015).\n\n\n                                                   88\n\f        He found similar problems with the speech pathologist’s report, which stated that\nA.A. “said her first word, quack, at one year and speaking a little more using animal\nsounds at 15 months.” Tr. at 527 (quoting Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5). He explained that the\nphrase “speaking a little more” is ambiguous and therefore unhelpful because it gives\nno indication of the number and quality of words present at 15 months, which is an\nimportant piece of information for diagnostic purposes. Tr. at 528. Depending on the\ndefinition, a speech regression is the loss of “either three words or five words, besides\nma-ma and da-da”—and “[t]here’s no comment here about whether she ever used ma-\nma and da-da.”158 Tr. at 528.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer contrasted these poorly obtained histories with the one elicited\nby Dr. Lavenstein, which he viewed as a good, well-documented example. Tr. at 526.\nDoctor Lavenstein’s report provided a clear indication of the quality of A.A.’s “speech”—\nshe “had oral sounds. He clearly had asked . . . the question, did your child have\nfunctional words, and the answer was no.” 159 Tr. at 526.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Wiznitzer was asked whether children with metabolic\nproblems are known to decompensate with infections. Tr. at 557. He indicated that\ndecompensation can occur with certain kinds of metabolic disorders, but in general, it is\nnot a concern. Tr. at 557. “It depends on the specific metabolic problem they have.”\nTr. at 557. He noted, for example, that patients with urea cycle disorders are\nsusceptible to potentially deleterious effects, but children “with creatine transport\ndeficiency don’t fall apart . . . with infection . . . [y]et they have a metabolic disturbance.”\nTr. at 558-59.\n\n        Doctor Wiznitzer was then questioned about an article submitted by Doctor\nCederbaum regarding the administration of vaccines to children with inborn errors of\nmetabolism [“IEM”]. Tr. at 559-64, 587-88 (citing F. Menni, et al., Vaccination in\nchildren with inborn errors of metabolism, VACCINE, 30 (50): 7161-64 (2012), filed as\nRes. Ex. E [hereinafter “Menni, Res. Ex. E”]). The article stated that administering\nvaccines to children with IEMs “is not as simple as in healthy subjects because the\nvaccines themselves can cause problems. They can theoretically deteriorate the fragile\nmetabolic equilibrium of affected children, particularly when they cause the same\nmetabolic (albeit less severe) changes that are usually associated with the disease they\nare meant to prevent.” Menni, Res. Ex. E at 7161-62. The article continued: “Vaccines\nshould be administered more cautiously to children with IEMs associated with significant\nrisk of morbidity and/or mortality with catabolic events: i.e., under strict medical\nsupervision, and only when the children are clinically well and their metabolic condition\nis acceptably controlled.” Id. at 7163. It also noted that “[p]articular care should be\n158\n   Doctor Wiznitzer stated that he did not recall A.A. using “ma-ma” or “da-da” to refer to her parents in\nthe video segments he watched. Tr. at 528.\n159\n   Doctor Wiznitzer indicated that if A.A.’s parents had told him that their child stopped talking, he would\nhave inquired about the level of “talking” she had been doing—was she simply repeating what the parents\nsaid, was she making animal sounds, did she have functional words? He emphasized that “we need all\nthat kind of information.” Tr. at 526.\n\n\n                                                     89\n\ftaken when administering vaccines based on live attenuated viruses because they can\ncause the same metabolic derangements as wild virus infections.” Id.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer agreed with the authors’ statements, but noted the word\n“theoretically”—“that doesn’t say it will do it, it just says theoretically.” Tr. at 560-61. He\nexplained that the concern relates to the fact that “vaccines can cause fever and fever\ncan make you catabolic.” Tr. at 561. He stated that the authors were not referring to all\nmetabolic disorders, but only those “that are at risk for morbidity when they go catabolic,\nsuch as amino acid disorders, organic acidemias, and urea cycle disorders.” Tr. at 561.\nMoreover, it was not the immunization, but its timing that was important—it should be\ngiven when the child is well and her condition is controlled. Tr. at 562. In response to\nadditional questioning, Dr. Wiznitzer confirmed that the MMR vaccine contains live\nattenuated virus, which is a weakened, “tamed down” version of the natural virus\nintended “provoke the immune response without provoking . . . a clinical infection.” Tr.\nat 563-64.\n\n         Doctor Wiznitzer was also questioned about a study that was discussed in the\nMenni (Res. Ex. E) article. Tr. at 565-87 (citing N. Klein, et al., Evaluation of\nImmunization Rates and Safety Among Children with Inborn Errors of Metabolism,\nPEDIATRICS, 127: e1139-46 (2011), filed as Res. Ex. D [hereinafter “Klein, Res. Ex. D”]).\nThe study focused on children with inherited metabolic disorders and sought to better\nunderstand immunization rates and vaccine safety within this population. Klein, Res.\nEx. D at e1139. Data for the study was obtained from medical records contained in the\nNorthern California Kaiser Permanente electronic database from 1990 to 2007. Id.\nBased on their analyses, the researchers found that vaccination of children with IEMs\n“was not associated with any significant increase in emergency department visits or\nhospitalizations during the 30 days after vaccination.” Id. However, “[s]econdary\nanalyses suggested that there may be increased rates of hospitalizations 2 weeks after\nvaccination for the sickest 1- to 4-year-old children.” Id. The researchers concluded\nthat “[i]mmunization was not associated with increased risk for serious adverse events\nduring the month after vaccination,” a finding that “provid[ed] overall reassurance that\nroutine vaccination of children with [IEMs] does not result in adverse effects.” Id.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer specifically addressed the researchers’ secondary analyses,\nwhich indicated a possible increase in the rate of hospitalization for children in the\n“sickest” category. Tr. at 565. He first explained that the researchers’ use of the word\n“may” indicated that the results did not reach statistical significance. 160 Tr. at 565-66.\nHe then explained that the results of the secondary analyses provided “limited\ninformation about which to reach conclusions.” Tr. at 571. This was due to the way the\nresearchers reported their results. The researchers stated that “they found a modest\nincreased risk of hospital admission” for the “sickest” children (Tr. at 571 (citing Klein,\nRes. Ex. D at e1144)); however, that category includes amino acid disorders, organic\nacidemias, urea cycle disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, mitochondrial disorders,\n\n160\n   Doctor Wiznitzer also noted the authors’ statement that their findings with “could be because of chance\ngiven the multiple comparison.” Klein, Res. Ex. D at e1145.\n\n\n                                                   90\n\fand glycogen storage diseases (Tr. at 571-72 (citing Klein, Res. Ex. D at e1142, Table\n2)). Because of this aggregation, it is unknown to the reader which conditions in the\n“sickest” category were associated with the increased rates of hospitalization after\nvaccination. Tr. at 572; see also Tr. 575-76. Consequently, “you can’t state that this\nmeans that children with mitochondrial disorders are at increased risk because they’re\nsubsumed within this population.” Tr. at 572. Indeed, it is possible that none of the\n“sickest” children had mitochondrial disorders. Id.\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer also pointed out that the researchers urged caution when\ninterpreting their finding “in light of the sparse data with a small number of\nhospitalizations, the lack of a clear association with any particular vaccine, the long time\nperiod over which these hospital events occurred, and the lack of [a] corresponding\nincrease in emergency department visits during the post-vaccine days zero to 14.” Tr.\nat 579-80 (quoting Klein, Res. Ex. D at e1145).\n\n       4. Doctor Cederbaum.\n\n        In his expert report, Dr. Cederbaum stated that he found no evidence that A.A.\n“has a mitochondrial disorder that would predispose her to autism when administered\nthe MMR vaccine.” Res. Ex. A at 5. In reaching his opinion, Dr. Cederbaum evaluated\nthe asserted temporal relationship between A.A.’s vaccination and the onset of her\nautistic symptoms; the validity of her mitochondrial disorder diagnosis; and the\neffectiveness of her prescribed mitochondrial treatment. Id.\n\n       With regard to the temporal relationship, he observed that the reported proximity\nof A.A.’s symptoms to her MMR vaccination compressed over time from two to four\nweeks following vaccination to one to two weeks. Res. Ex. A at 5. He viewed the\nshortened timeline as the sole product of parental report, unsupported by the medical\nrecord. Id. Concerning the mitochondrial diagnosis, he found it to be “based on very\nflimsy evidence that has not been accepted as valid by [those] who work in the area of\ninborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disorders.” Id. at 6. Indeed, the only\nsupport for Dr. Kelley’s diagnostic approach was his own work, which consisted of a\nsingle published paper. Id. (citing Weissman, Pet. Ex. 28).\n\n       As for the prescribed treatment, he noted that mitochondrial cocktails are widely\nviewed as ineffective, albeit harmless. Id. at 7 (citing P. Chinnery and L. Bindoff, 116th\nENMC international workshop: the treatment of mitochondrial disorders, 14th-16th March\n2003, Naarden, The Netherlands, NEUROMUSCULAR DISORD., 13: 757-64 (2003), filed as\nRes. Ex. J [hereinafter “Chinnery, Res. Ex. J”]). He stated that it was unclear in this\ncase why Dr. Kelley thought such treatment would make a difference after the damage\nfrom the acute insult had already been done. Id. at 7-8. In any event, A.A.’s\nimprovement “was not so dramatic as to fairly ascribe it to any intervention.” Id. at 8.\nDoctor Cederbaum concluded: “To the majority of the metabolic world, few would even\nconsider a mitochondrial disorder in this setting.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             91\n\f        At hearing, Dr. Cederbaum reiterated his opinion that A.A. did not have a\nmitochondrial disease. 161 Tr. at 385, 399-400, 408. He stated that Dr. Kelley’s\napproach to diagnosing mitochondrial disease is not nationally or internationally\naccepted or established. Tr. at 388. He explained that mitochondrial disease is\ndiagnosed using standardized criteria in the medical literature, including papers\npublished by Walker, Morava, and Bernier. 162 According to Dr. Cederbaum, these\nstandards were established to provide a common language in the field and prevent\n“intellectual and medical anarchy.” Tr. at 386. He stated that the Walker criteria were\nestablished for just this reason—“people were calling [everything] mitochondrial\ndisease.” Tr. at 386. That problem has now been completely alleviated. Tr. at 386.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum then discussed Pet. Ex. 23B, Dr. Kelley’s unpublished\nmethod for evaluating and treating patients with autism and mitochondrial disease. Tr.\nat 387. Doctor Cederbaum stated that the parameters used by Dr. Kelley generally did\nnot meet any of the standard published criteria. Tr. at 387-88. In his view, the paper\nwas “a very permissive and broadly-based and non[-]literature-supported document.”\nTr. at 388. He did agree with Dr. Kelley that muscle biopsies are unreliable and should\nnot be used as a diagnostic tool. Tr. at 389, 456-57. With regard to Dr. Kelley’s\nreliance on amino acids, Dr. Cederbaum explained that most practitioners would look\ncarefully at alanine levels if they suspected mitochondrial disease, but would not focus\nsolely on amino acids. Tr. at 388. He stated that amino acid levels could be affected by\nfactors other than mitochondrial disease and he “doubted very much whether most\npeople would describe the mitochondria as regulating alanine levels.” Tr. at 389-90.\n\n         Apart from A.A.’s abnormal alanine level, Dr. Cederbaum did not consider any of\nthe lab results to be indicative of mitochondrial disease. 163 Tr. at 390. He confirmed\nthat plasma alanine is a primary biomarker, but stated that it is “not sufficient, in and of\nitself, to make the diagnosis.” Tr. at 392. In A.A.’s case, the elevated result of 634 164\n161\n   Doctor Cederbaum stated that the terms “disease” and “disorder” tend to be used synonymously;\nhowever, strictly speaking, disease typically denotes a more serious abnormality or condition than\ndisorder. See Tr. at 383, 417-18. He defined “mitochondrial disease” as “an abnormality of the\nmitochondria that has some demonstrable effect on the function of the mitochondrion.” Tr. at 383. He\nthen defined “primary mitochondrial disease” as that caused by a mutation—an inborn mutation—in a\nmitochondrial gene. Tr. at 382, 418. He explained that the mutation can occur in genes in the nuclear\ngenome, as well as the mitochondrial genome. Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA can result in\n“heteroplasmy.” Tr. at 382. Doctor Cederbaum explained that heteroplasmy occurs when mutations\naffect some mitochondria and not others, resulting in a “population of normal and abnormal ones.” Tr. at\n460. “[B]ecause it can vary from tissue to tissue and even from parts of one tissue to another, [there] may\n[be] variable symptoms or signs in that tissue, depending on the proportion of abnormal mitochondria.”\nTr. at 460. Primary mitochondrial disease can cause dysfunction ranging from death in the neonatal\nperiod to various chronic disorders. Tr. at 383. He defined “secondary mitochondrial disease” as “any\neffect that does not involve a mutation in a mitochondrial gene but which would appear to affect\nmitochondrial function.” Tr. at 384.\n162\n      Walker, Res. Ex. T; Morava, Res. Ex. U; Bernier, Res. Ex. V.\n163\n      His assessment included the labs from Children’s Hospital, which he viewed as normal. Tr. at 400.\n164\n      Doctor Cederbaum slightly misstated the alanine value as 636. Tr. at 392; see Pet. Ex. 23A.\n\n\n                                                     92\n\fwould have concerned him; however, he would never have ordered the test that gave\nthat result, because the three previous tests were normal. Tr. at 392. Only if he had\nseen that elevated result in the beginning would he have repeated the test. Tr. at 392.\nAccording to Dr. Cederbaum, the single elevated alanine level was not indicative of\nmitochondrial disease, but “it would have been worrisome, and [he] certainly would have\npursued it further.” Tr. at 392.\n\n       Doctor Cederbaum stated that he had never heard of glycine as a primary\nbiomarker for mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 393. He noted that it was not discussed in\nthe published literature on the diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial disease, and Dr.\nKelley’s own paper was yet unpublished. 165 Tr. at 393. In any event, A.A.’s glycine\nlevels were normal. Tr. at 394. As for the purported significance of the alanine and\nglycine ratio, he confessed that he did not fully understand Dr. Kelley’s methods. Tr. at\n394. He noted, for example, that it was not standard practice to normalize data as Dr.\nKelley had done when investigating for possible mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 394.\nNonetheless, he was confident that an elevation in alanine and glycine together would\nnot be sufficient to infer a Complex I deficiency. Tr. at 394-95. 166\n\n        In an effort to demonstrate that various combinations of organic acids have\nrelevance to diagnosing mitochondrial disorders, Dr. Cederbaum was cross-examined\nregarding the Morgan article (T. Morgan, et al., Vaccines Are Not Associated With\nMetabolic Events in Children With Urea Cycle Disorders, PEDIATRICS, 127: e1147-53\n(2012), filed as Res. Ex. C [hereinafter “Morgan, Res. Ex. C”]), which focused on\npatients with urea cycle disorders. Tr. at 432-38. Specifically, he was asked about “the\nthinking behind why glutamine, glycine, alanine, arginine, and citrulline” were measured\nin the study. Tr. at 435. Doctor Cederbaum explained that these amino acids were\nchosen due to their involvement in the urea cycle and he described the importance of\n\n165\n     On cross examination, petitioners’ counsel likened Dr. Kelley’s unpublished methods for diagnosing\nmitochondrial disease in children with autism to Dr. Cederbaum’s pre-publication discovery of the\nmitochondrial condition known as MELAS. Tr. at 419-22. In response to questioning, Dr. Cederbaum\nacknowledged that his work was initially met with some skepticism and that it took a decade for his\ndiscovery to gain acceptance. Tr. at 420-21. He stated, however, that unlike Dr. Kelley, he presented the\nunderlying data in public so other researchers could understand, replicate, and build on his conclusions.\nTr. at 420. He noted that Dr. Kelley has “held these views about mitochondrial disease [for] 15 years,” but\nstill has not disclosed his data. Tr. at 420-21. In response to further questioning, Dr. Cederbaum clarified\nthat he was not criticizing Dr. Kelley’s logic, only his conclusions, which are unproven and unaccepted.\nTr. at 427-28. He encouraged Dr. Kelley to “publish this and verify it and have it pass through peer\nreview and have it catch on.” Tr. at 428. He stated that “it might prove at some time in the future to be\ncorrect,” it is just “not proven to be correct yet, now.” Tr. at 428.\n166\n   Doctor Cederbaum challenged Dr. Kelley’s “observations comparing proven Complex I deficiency and\nthe amino acid levels.” Tr. at 395. He stated that a review of the supplementary data in the Weissman\npaper raised significant concerns in his mind regarding the validity of the conclusions that were drawn.\nTr. at 395; see also Tr. at 422-24 (cross examination questioning whether Dr. Cederbaum viewed the\nresearchers’ institutions as not credible); Tr. at 461-62 (examination by court). Specifically, he examined\nthe data in Supplementary Table 6, which reported the raw data for the muscle biopsies. Tr. at 395. The\nComplex I levels in some of the data “were so surprisingly low . . . that they were unbelievable in\nsomeone who was actually walking around.” Tr. at 395-96.\n\n\n                                                    93\n\feach. Tr. at 435-36. He was then asked whether Dr. Kelley’s methods were analogous,\nas they were likewise based on the measurement of amino acids. Tr. at 436. Doctor\nCederbaum appeared to find it difficult to respond to this question, but explained that\nthe comparison was inapt because “glycine is not known to be involved in the\nrespiratory chain.” Tr. at 436. It is a respiratory chain disorder (Complex I) problem that\nDr. Kelley believed A.A. had.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum was also asked on cross examination to address Dr. Kelley’s\nanalogy of proline to hemoglobin A1c in diabetes. Tr. at 437. In diabetes, hemoglobin\nA1c serves as a biological marker for the average blood sugar levels over a period of\nabout 90 days. See Hennessey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1709053</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at*17 (discussing the diagnostic\nsignificance of rising hemoglobin A1c levels in diabetes). According to Dr. Kelley, proline\nlevels, when precisely measured, could similarly serve as a marker for increased lactate\nlevels over some unspecified period of time. 167 Doctor Cederbaum responded that he\ncould not elaborate on Dr. Kelley’s analogy because it was “not something [he]\nunderst[oo]d or is in the literature.” Tr. at 437. Whether “it” referred to hemoglobin A1c\nor to proline’s utility as a biomarker was not clear in Dr. Cederbaum’s response.\nHowever, it is clear that there is no recognized or accepted crosswalk between proline\nand ETC function, unlike the widely accepted use of hemoglobin A1c levels to convey\naverage blood sugar levels over recent months. 168\n\n       With regard to the plasma lactate levels, Dr. Cederbaum viewed A.A.’s slightly\nelevated results as normal. Tr. at 391. Indeed, he and his colleagues would have\n“ignore[d] even higher values because the frequency of artifact in children 169 is very\nhigh and to follow it up is not so easy.” 170 Tr. at 391. He stated that lactate is a “very\nimportant” biomarker for mitochondrial disease and one he has considered “hundreds of\ntimes” in his years of practice. 171 Tr. at 390; see also Tr. at 400. He noted, however,\nthat the lactate test is highly susceptible to artifact and is typically ordered only when\nthere is a “reasonable prior probability” of mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 390-91.\n\n      Doctor Cederbaum also addressed various other lab results which Dr. Kelley\nviewed as significant. He stated that A.A.’s CO2 levels were not indicative of\n\n167\n      See Tr. at 167-68, 187-88; see also Tr. at 667 (court examination).\n168\n   Because hemoglobin A1c levels are a measurement of blood sugar over a known period of time,\ndiabetic patients no longer need to maintain logs of several-times-daily spot blood sugar testing to show\ntreatment and dietary compliance to their physicians.\n169\n   He explained that children typically are fearful and struggle when their blood is drawn, which greatly\nelevates lactate levels, without being indicative of an underlying mitochondrial problem. Tr. at 391-92.\n170\n   Doctor Cederbaum noted that a routine and reliable alternative would be to “collect the lactate and\npyruvate [together] . . . under conditions that we would call rest. And we have a specific protocol for\ndoing that.” Tr. at 391.\n171\n     He was surprised that Drs. Kelley and Zimmerman “dismissed the lactate as being unimportant when\nit’s one of the primary biomarkers for mitochondrial disease.” Tr. at 393.\n\n\n                                                      94\n\fmitochondrial disease. Tr. at 396. Indeed, according to Dr. Cederbaum, CO2 levels are\nnot a primary biomarker for mitochondrial disease or “even a primary biomarker for\nmetabolic disease in general.” Tr. at 396. Similarly, creatine kinase is not a primary\nbiomarker for mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 397. He also stated that he was not aware\nof any peer-reviewed literature that identified AST or the AST-ALT ratio as a primary\nmarker for mitochondrial disease in the general population. Tr. at 398-99. Doctor\nCederbaum stated that he was open-minded toward the idea that the AST-ALT ratio or\ncreatine levels could be valid criterion for at least suspecting mitochondrial disorder,\nhowever, they are not presently criteria published in the medical literature. Tr. at 398-\n99. He would not accept them as diagnostic of mitochondrial disorder. Tr. at 398-99. I\nnote that this testimony was effectively unrebutted, as no peer-reviewed literature filed\nidentified these tests as primary biomarkers for mitochondrial disease. In his view, none\nof A.A.’s lab results were indicative of a likely Complex I deficiency. Tr. at 400-01.\n\n       In response to additional questioning, Dr. Cederbaum stated that he had not\npreviously heard that a reaction to L-carnitine could be a diagnostic indicator of a\nComplex I deficiency. 172 Tr. at 401. He stated that the basis for Dr. Kelley’s assertion\nthat L-carnitine activates Complex I was not apparent. Tr. at 401. As for the use of\nvitamin cocktails, Dr. Cederbaum stated that he does not view them as an effective\ntreatment. 173 Tr. at 403. He acknowledged that Dr. Zimmerman and Mr. Allen\ndescribed apparent temporally related improvement; however, a cause and effect\nrelationship has not been shown. Tr. at 404.\n\n       Doctor Cederbaum also indicated that mitochondrial PDD or mitochondrial\nautism was not an established diagnosis in the metabolic community, but noted that a\n“cohort of individuals” around the country believe it is valid. Tr. at 404. The majority of\nthe community does not view it as a legitimate diagnosis, however, especially in light of\nnewer techniques, such as “whole exome sequencing, that have found presumed\nmutations in autism, [which] don’t include mitochondrial genes, but they do include\n172\n   In response to my questioning, Dr. Cederbaum stated that carnitine is not known to cause seizures;\nthus, in his view, the relationship between A.A.’s treatment with carnitine and her seizures is solely a\ntemporal one. Tr. at 465.\n173\n   On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum reiterated that this “type of treatment . . . has been used for\nyears, [but] there’s no compelling evidence it really works.” Tr. at 459 (citing Chinnery, Res. Ex. J); see\nalso Tr. at 459-60 (citing S. Yazdani, et al. eds, CHRONIC COMPLEX DISEASES OF CHILDHOOD: A PRACTICAL\nGUIDE FOR CLINICIANS (2011), filed as Pet. Ex. 74 [hereinafter “Yazdani, Pet. Ex. 74”], at 185). I queried\nDr. Cederbaum about why vitamin cocktails would be used if there is no evidence that it works. Tr. at\n462-64. In his view:\n\n        [P]hysicians have a very low tolerance for being able to say, ‘I do nothing.’ So, there’s\n        this suspicion that vitamins can’t possibly be harmful, and . . . you can develop a rationale\n        for why a cocktail of these substances might work, and you throw in carnitine, which has\n        a lesser rationale; you throw in thiamine, which we know most affects the pyruvate\n        dehydrogenation and not the mitochondria; you throw in riboflavin because it’s a cofactor\n        for Complex II; Co-Q is an electron transporter, and it may be if you throw in Co-Q, you’ll\n        bypass a block.”\n\nTr. at 462.\n\n                                                     95\n\fgenes that have to do with brain development and synaptic formation.” Tr. at 404. He\nnoted that such testing was not available in 2002. Tr. at 405-06. Genetic testing for\nmitochondrial disease was not performed on A.A. Tr. at 406.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum agreed that a person with a mitochondrial\ndisorder could display signs and symptoms of autism. Tr. at 418. In his view, autism is\n“a symptom complex . . . caused by a lot of different things.” Tr. at 418. As such, he\nfound no inherent reason why “you couldn’t have some [mitochondrial] patients who\ndisplay that symptom complex.” Tr. at 418.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum discussed A.A.’s treatment with valproate (Depakote). Tr. at\n406-08; see also Tr. at 438-46 (cross). He stated that valproate is “absolutely not”\nrecommended for patients with mitochondrial disease, because it has “been known for\nmany years . . . [as] a mitochondrial toxin.” Tr. at 406. He explained that a physician\n“would never use it” if he or she suspected mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 406. He stated\nthat if A.A. had a mitochondrial disease he would have expected to see an elevation of\nlactate and pyruvate, as well as a physical reaction to Depakote. Tr. at 407-08. He\nreferenced several medical articles174 that reported “severely abnormal reactions to\nvalproate [Depakote], sometimes when they knew that it was a mitochondrial disease\nand used it inadvertently or ignorantly, and sometimes [when] the suspicion of\nmitochondrial disease was not raised until [after the] horrible reaction.” Tr. at 406.\nGiven this contraindication, Dr. Cederbaum questioned why A.A.’s physicians would\nprescribe Depakote to treat her seizures, which were not severe, when “there’s a whole\npharmacopeia of available anticonvulsants.” Tr. at 408; see also Tr. at 440-41 (cross).\nIn his opinion, they were “either woefully ignorant or they didn’t believe that [she had] a\nmitochondrial disorder in the first place.” Tr. at 408.\n\n       In response to questioning on cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum stated that it\nwas possible that some mitochondrial disorders would be permissive of valproate. Tr.\nat 440. However, the current standard of care is to avoid the drug unless the patient\nhas a “desperate, desperate, intractable seizure disorder.” Tr. at 441. A.A. did not have\na severe, untreatable seizure disorder. Tr. at 440. Doctor Cederbaum was asked to\nconfirm that valproate had not worsened A.A.’s mitochondrial dysfunction. Tr. at 441.\nHe responded that that was true “because she didn’t have a mitochondrial disorder. Tr.\n\n174\n    J.

He\nalso confirmed that, based on her AST levels, the drug did not affect her liver function.\nTr. at 441-46.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum was asked to address possible and known stressors in\nmitochondrial disease. Tr. at 409. He explained that “[a]ll inborn errors have stressors\nthat appear to exacerbate them,” although many remain unidentified. Tr. at 409. He\nstated that intercurrent illnesses, such as respiratory infection or a urinary tract infection,\nare known stressors of mitochondrial disease. Tr. at 410. As for vaccines, he stated\nthat they are not known stressors, but “are always given with caution.” Tr. at 411-13\n(citing Morgan, Res. Ex. C; Klein, Res. Ex. D).\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum reiterated that infections are known\nmetabolic stressors. Tr. at 429. He also acknowledged that metabolic decompensation\nhas been reported following immunization. Tr. at 429-30, 456. Asked whether he saw\n“any correlation between infections and what happens after an immunization,” he\nresponded that there is “an inflammatory component to both, [but] we have not yet in\nmedicine defined [that] inflammatory component . . . that might in some instances cause\na metabolic deterioration.” Tr. at 430. Concerning the putative “window of vulnerability”\ndiscussed by Dr. Kelley, he noted that Dr. Kelley’s window of vulnerability “occurs when\nwe know that the onset of autism is most common. So, it could be just cotemporal”—\n“they are not necessarily related as cause and effect.” Tr. at 431.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum addressed several research articles submitted by Dr.\nZimmerman pertaining to mitochondrial dysfunction and autism. Tr. at 413-16 (citing\nTang, Pet. Ex. 65; Anitha, Pet. Ex. 66; Ginsberg, Pet. Ex. 67; D. Rossignol and R. Frye,\nMitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis, MOLEC. PSYCHIAT., 17: 290-314 (2012), filed as Pet. Ex. 68 [hereinafter\n“Rossingnol, Pet. Ex. 68”]; Chauhan, Pet. Ex. 69). Doctor Cederbaum stated that he\nhad read the articles, but viewed them as uninformative because petitioners’ stated\nhypothesis relates to “a primary genetic abnormality,\" whereas the data in the articles\nrelates to “a secondary abnormality”—it is “apples and oranges.” Tr. at 416. In his\nopinion, the data from the articles simply “are not interpretable or applicable at this time\nto this case.” Tr. at 416.\n\n       On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum was asked about the Walker (Res. Ex. T),\nMorava (Res. Ex. U), and Bernier (Res. Ex. V) articles, which discuss diagnostic criteria\nfor mitochondrial disorders. Tr. at 446-47. In response to questioning, Dr. Cederbaum\nconfirmed that the Walker criteria were developed for adults, but noted that it was later\nexpanded by Morava and Bernier. Tr. at 446-47. He acknowledged that the criteria\noutlined in the papers were propositional at the time; however, he indicated that there is\nnow general acceptance of the criteria as applicable to both patient populations. Tr. at\n448-49. There are practitioners, though, such as Dr. Kelley, who “fe[el] no compunction\nabout applying [their] own criteria,” so acceptance is not universal. Tr. at 449. When\nasked to clarify what he meant by Dr. Kelley’s own criteria, he responded the “ones that\n\n\n                                              97\n\falanine and glycine elevation alone, with creatine kinase and AST-ALT ratio are\nsufficient to diagnose a mild form of [mitochondrial disorder].” Tr. at 449.\n\n        On cross examination, Dr. Cederbaum elaborated on the various criteria\ndiscussed in the articles. Tr. at 449. As an initial matter, he noted that the articles were\nwritten for the population that studies this area, so they sometimes are “almost like a\nshorthand”—the authors assume those reading the article have a basic familiarity with\nthe concepts and theories underlying the research. Tr. at 450. So “[w]hen you talk\nabout metabolic abnormalities, lactate, pyruvate, and alanine are understood as being a\ncriterion.” Tr. at 450-51. Doctor Cederbaum was then questioned about alanine as a\nsubstitute marker for pyruvate. He responded that alanine was “absolutely not” a\nsubstitute, but “a reflection of pyruvate.” Tr. at 451. He continued that “nobody would\nsuggest that it’s a substitute. In fact, alanine can be elevated in circumstances in which\npyruvate is normal.” Tr. at 451. As an example, he explained that\n\n       in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, where there is no oxidative\n       problem, the lactate-pyruvate ratio is normal as it would be in someone\n       without any metabolic disorder, whereas generally, in mitochondrial\n       disorders, where there’s an oxidative problem, you may have elevated\n       alanine, but the lactate-pyruvate ratio will be distorted in favor of lactate,\n       because of the oxidation.\n\nTr. at 451-52; see also S. Yazdani, et al. eds, CHRONIC COMPLEX DISEASES OF\nCHILDHOOD: A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR CLINICIANS (2011), filed as Pet. Ex. 74 [hereinafter\n“Yazdani, Pet. Ex. 74”] (textbook chapters Dr. Cederbaum wrote on disorders of\npyruvate metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency). He also confirmed that\n“you [can] have a normal lactate and pyruvate level and still have a mitochondrial\nproblem.” Tr. at 453.\n\n       In response to additional questioning on cross examination about his textbook\nchapters, Dr. Cederbaum agreed that there were a wide range of symptoms that can\nappear in a mitochondrial disorder. Tr. at 455 (citing Yazdani, Pet. Ex. 74). He also\nagreed that both single and multisystem organs can be affected in a respiratory chain\ndisorder. Tr. at 455. He confirmed that the onset of symptoms in the multisystem\ndisorder can appear at different times—for example, the brain symptoms could appear\nbefore the gastrointestinal symptoms. Tr. at 456.\n\n       Doctor Cederbaum was cross-examined regarding the use of ratios for\ncomparing biochemical markers in metabolic research. Tr. at 454. He confirmed that\ntheir use is “perfectly reasonable” and, when valid, can help researchers identify and\ncorrect false positives in test results. Tr. at 454. Doctor Cederbaum acknowledged that\nDr. Kelley’s use of ratios was done for this reason; however, he did not indicate whether\nhe believed the ratios to be valid. Tr. at 455.\n\n       On cross examination, petitioners’ counsel recalled that Dr. Cederbaum agreed\nwith Dr. Kelley that muscle biopsies are unreliable and should not be used as a\n\n\n                                              98\n\fdiagnostic tool. Tr. at 457. She then noted that muscle biopsy results were classified\nas one of the major criteria in Walker and asked Dr. Cederbaum what criterion has\ntaken its place. Tr. at 457 (citing Walker, Res. Ex. T at 264). He responded that the\nsubstitute criterion “would be persistent, really unequivocal elevations in lactate, and a\nmultisystem disease.” Tr. at 457. He noted, however, that “the bar” has really been\n“raised by the newer technologies. So that now there’s no way to diagnose a\nmitochondrial disorder without doing whole exome [analysis], which will look at both the\nmitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome.” Tr. at 457.\n\n        At the conclusion of his testimony, I asked Dr. Cederbaum if in summary it would\nbe correct to say that he did not view Dr. Kelley’s hypotheses as wrong, just not proven.\nTr. at 466. He affirmed my statement. Tr. at 466. I then asked him whether by “not\nproven” he meant “not probable or not certain or just that we don’t know.” Tr. at 466.\nDoctor Cederbaum responded that when a scientist proposes something, the onus is on\nthat person “to demonstrate or prove . . . the veracity of what they’re proposing.” Tr. at\n466. With regard to Dr. Kelley’s hypotheses, “there is a way of doing that now, and that\nwould be whole exome [analysis].” Tr. at 466. He stated that Dr. Kelley “ought to be\nfiguring out a way to pay for whole exome sequencing” to determine whether any of his\npatients have mitochondrial gene mutations. Tr. at 466. Doctor Cederbaum recognized\nthat a patient could have a mitochondrial disorder and also have normal exome results,\nwith no abnormality in a mitochondrial gene; however, he reiterated that the onus is on\nDr. Kelley to show “that some of these patients have a mitochondrial gene that’s\nmutated.” Tr. at 466-67. Such findings would allow a reasonable inference that some\nothers might have mutations as well. Tr. at 466-67.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum also emphasized the importance of publication and\nreproducibility. Tr. at 467-68. He explained that publication exposes an idea to a\nknowledgeable community and allows them to review and pass judgment on it. Tr. at\n467. Publication generally represents acceptance by scientific peers. Tr. at 467.\nAlthough “correct ideas may [initially] get rejected, . . . they won’t get rejected always,\nand you can get anything published today,” especially with so many options available.\nTr. at 467.\n\n        Doctor Cederbaum also explained that reproducibility—the ability of others to\nduplicate the results—factors into whether an idea is considered proven or established.\nTr. at 467-68. He explained, for example, that a paper on Dr. Kelley’s theory would\nprovide the “biochemical data alongside whole exome data, and maybe because it’s\nautism, [there would be] a comparative genome hybridization.” Tr. at 468. This would\nallow “someone else [to] take their series of patients and replicate it”—they would try to\nrepeat what Dr. Kelley says he has done. Tr. at 468. Unfortunately, in its current form,\nDr. Kelley’s methods and theories cannot be replicated or confirmed. Tr. at 468.\n\n                                  VII. Factual Findings.\n\n       I have carefully considered the record as a whole in arriving at the factual\nfindings set forth below.\n\n\n                                             99\n\fA. Pre-Vaccination.\n\n        1. Pre-Vaccination Health.\n\n       During her first 15 months of life, A.A. suffered multiple minor illnesses, including\nrespiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and OM. She was physically normal upon\nexamination at each of her well child visits through 12 months of age. She also was\nphysically normal at her 15-month visit, except for fluid-filled tympanic membranes\nindicative of an ear infection. A.A. suffered from chronic ear infections.\n\n        2. Pre-Vaccination Development.\n\n       A.A. had symptoms of ASD prior to the administration of the October 23, 2000\nMMR vaccination. Although she developed normally during her first year of life and\nachieved expected milestones, by 15 months of age A.A. had possessed few if any\nfunctional words. Although the Denver II reflected three words, the video evidence\nsuggested a very limited vocabulary.\n\n        I do not accept the testimony of A.A.’s father and aunt that she possessed\nbetween 12 and 100 words by 15 months of age, or that she had the ability to name\ncolors, count, or tell “knock-knock” jokes. 175 Their statements are contrary to more\nreliable contemporaneous evidence, including earlier parental reports and video taken\nduring the period in question.\n\n      Petitioners provided histories closer in time to the described events (and before\nthey began to blame the MMR vaccine for A.A.’s problems), which indicated that A.A.\nspoke very few words by 15 months of age and primarily made animal, and other oral\nsounds, which lacked meaning. 176 These reports were confirmed by the video evidence\nrecorded on October 14, 2000, wherein she vocalized but spoke no words, including\n“ma-ma” and “da-da.” 177\n\n175\n   I credit Dr. Wiznitzer’s testimony that it would be “highly, highly unlikely” for a child that age to have\nsuch a vocabulary due to the way language develops and also “the immaturity of the oral motor\nmechanism in terms of verbalization.” Tr. at 535-36 (cross). In his many years of practice he could not\nrecall ever meeting a child who had 24 words at 15 months of age—“functional words that they use\nindependently.” Tr. at 536. Even Dr. Zimmerman conceded that A.A.’s reported ability to name colors\nwas probably overstated based on the level of development he saw on the video. Tr. at 357-59.\n176\n   See, e.g., Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5 (parental report at speech and language evaluation on September 5, 2001,\nthat A.A. spoke “her first word ‘Quack’ at 1 year and [spoke] a little more/using animal sounds at 15\nmonths”); Pet. Ex. 9, p. 96 (parental report to Dr. Lavenstein on September 16, 2001, that A.A. “had some\noral sounds” in October 2000, “but then subsequently regressed”); Pet. Ex. 6, p. 25 (parental report to Dr.\nRaymond on February 13, 2002, that prior to approximately 16 months of age, she “was able to make\n‘animal sounds’ such as ‘roar!’ when asked, and was able to state her age”).\n177\n   With regard to A.A.’s language development as seen in the video, Dr. Zimmerman—petitioners’ own\nexpert—testified that she was “not forming words,” but “making word sounds.” Tr. at 297-98. In later\ntestimony, he recalled her “babbling some word sounds” during the video, but no other specific words. Tr.\n\n                                                      100\n\f       A.A. also exhibited abnormal behavior for a 15 month old child. In the October\n14 video, A.A. demonstrated normal gross motor skills and an appropriate interest in her\nsurroundings; however, the quality and level of her interpersonal interactions with her\nparents was diminished. As Dr. Wiznitzer observed, she did not seek to be picked up\nand held by her parents and made limited eye contact. 178 She also engaged in hand\nflapping—a stereotypy commonly seen in autistic individuals. 179\n\n       According to Dr. Zimmerman, A.A.’s behavior appeared normal in “all respects”\nand he specifically disagreed with Dr. Wiznitzer that she exhibited any hand flapping\nduring the video. 180 Although he did note other repetitive movements, he explained\nthem away, stating that abnormal motor behaviors and stereotypies almost always\ncome after loss of language and relatedness—there is a “hierarchy of symptoms” in\nASD. 181 Later, however, he stated that stereotypies can come before loss of language,\nespecially in a child who develops autism early. 182 But he maintained that A.A. was not\nsuch a child because “her development was normal” and the behaviors were simply the\n“immature movements” of a young child. 183\n\n       I find Dr. Wiznitzer’s testimony more persuasive on the nature of AA’s behavior\non the videos, particularly in view of his clinical experience. Although both pediatric\nneurologists were well-qualified to opine on ASD, it appears to me that Dr.\nZimmerman’s focus in research has been on biochemical and cellular differences\nbetween those with ASD and those with typical development, whereas Dr. Wiznitzer’s\nfocus has been on ASD behaviors, co-morbidities, and diagnosis. See Pet. Ex. 26, pp.\n16-24 (Dr. Zimmerman’s publications) and Res. Ex. L, pp. 13-23 (Dr. Wiznitzer’s\npublications). Doctor Wiznitzer’s testimony tracked what I observed on the videos.\n\nB. Post-Vaccination Health.\n\n           1. Health.\n\nat 344 (cross). Even if one accepts that “moo” is a functional word, as Dr. Zimmerman contended, A.A.\nstill had fewer words than would be expected for a 15 month old child. See Tr. at 677.\n178\n   Although Dr. Zimmerman commented that A.A. appeared to be “making eye contact with the person\nwho’s taking the film,” he conceded that he could not know whether she was making eye contact with her\nparents or simply looking at the camera. Tr. at 345 (cross).\n179\n  Doctor Zimmerman later observed this behavior first-hand during an early follow-up visit on July 15,\n2002. See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 21.\n180\n      Tr. at 299.\n181\n      Tr. at 676-77.\n182\n      Tr. at 681.\n183\n      Tr. at 681-82.\n\n\n                                                  101\n\f      A.A.’s first medical visit following her MMR vaccination was on December 18,\n2000, when she was approximately 17 months old. She was treated for a viral infection\nand early OM.\n\n      Prior to that visit, she was not seen or otherwise treated for any illness or medical\nconcern—a nearly two-month period after the MMR vaccination.\n\n        I find that A.A. was not ill as the result of her MMR vaccination. I do not accept\nMr. Allen’s testimony that A.A. developed a fever on the night of October 29, 2000, or\nthat he or his wife called A.A.’s pediatrician seeking advice. There is no record of the\nfever or of the telephone call. A spiking fever, which reportedly lasted four days, would\nlikely have been noted somewhere by her pediatrician—especially if they called twice,\nas asserted. 184\n\n       Petitioners had previously consulted a pediatrician in person when A.A. was ill. It\nis counter-intuitive that that would not have done so when she spiked a fever lasting\nfour days. It was petitioners’ custom to take A.A. in for office examinations whenever\nshe was sick, regardless of symptoms. As such, it is very unlikely that petitioners would\nsimply have called the pediatrician in this instance. 185\n\n        As was the case prior to her vaccination, A.A. suffered from chronic OM. The\nmedical records reflect that between her first post-vaccination appointment on\nDecember 18, 2000, and her two-year well child visit on August 6, 2001, she was\ndiagnosed with five ear infections. Other illnesses during this period included viral\ninfection, URI, and UTI.\n\n           2. Developmental Regression\n\n      A.A. did not experience an abrupt deterioration of her development after the\nMMR vaccination. Based on contemporaneous medical records, nearly two months\nelapsed before she returned to her pediatrician (December 18, 2000), and even then\nnothing was observed or reported as to a loss of skills or other significant behavioral\nchange.\n\n        The first report of any developmental concern was more than four months after\nthe MMR vaccination, on March 1, 2001, when A.A. was seen for her 18-month well\nchild visit. 186 At that visit, her health care provider noted that she had not achieved\n\n184\n      See Tr. at 79-80.\n185\n   Petitioners took A.A. to the pediatrician for the same symptoms—high fever, irritability, and refusal to\neat—on November 11, 1999, at four months of age. They were instructed at that visit about the\nseriousness of a fever exceeding 100 degrees and of symptoms lasting more than three days. See Pet.\nEx. 9, p. 62.\n186\n      As previously noted, A.A. was more than 19 months old at the time of the visit.\n\n\n                                                      102\n\fsome of the expected milestones, and her mother expressed concern about her\nlanguage skills and withdrawing behavior. Her concern about A.A.’s social and\nlanguage development had likely grown over time, as A.A.’s mother did not mention any\nabrupt deterioration or point at which her concern crystalized, and did indicate that there\nhad been a problem (attributed to the prior nanny) over several months, and that A.A,\nwas opening up more with the new nanny. A.A. had 4-10 words (the Denver II chart at\nPet. Ex. 9, p. 7 reflected 6 or more words) at this visit, suggesting an increase in\nvocabulary, although there was a concern about consistency in her language.\n\n       Over the next few months, A.A. returned to the doctor for various illnesses,\nincluding a series of ear infections. On May 7, 2001, her pediatrician formally assessed\nher with delayed speech. The diagnosis was repeated at her two-year well child visit on\nAugust 6, 2001, and she was referred for speech evaluation.\n\n       At the speech evaluation, which took place on September 5, 2001, petitioners\nreported that A.A. “stopped speaking after having 3 ear infections in a row” 187—the last\nof which occurred nearly six months after vaccination.\n\n       Although Mr. Allen testified to an alternate, condensed timeline, supported by the\ntestimony of Ms. Edick, involving abrupt changes in A.A.’s behavior within one to two\nweeks of her MMR vaccination, including loss of language, flattened emotions,\ndecreased eye contact, and diminished social interactions, I do not credit their\ntestimony. I am certain that these changes occurred, as they were noted in later\nevaluations, but I do not find it probable that they occurred abruptly within a few weeks\nof the MMR vaccination.\n\n       Rather, I find it likely that A.A.’s behavioral problems began to be more\nnoticeable as she got older. The Christmas 2000 video showed behavioral differences\nsuggestive of ASD, but to her parents, they likely represented toddler obstinacy and\ntantrums. Certainly, they were not mentioned at the March well-child visit or in the\nseveral histories provided before Mr. Allen’s internet research prior to a call to\nCountryside in mid-January 2002.\n\n        Doctor Zimmerman testified that he observed behavioral changes between the\nOctober 14 and October 29 videos that correlated with Mr. Allen’s report that A.A.\n“changed within one to two weeks after the MMR immunization.” 188 He stated that the\nrapidity of A.A.’s regression was “striking” and “somewhat unusual.” 189 In response to\nquestioning he discussed the role of environment on behavior and recognized that the\nvideos were shot in different settings; 190 however, he did not think that was a factor in\n187\n      Pet. Ex. 5, p. 5.\n188\n      Tr. at 302-03.\n189\n      Tr. at 349.\n190\n      Tr. at 355-56.\n\n\n                                            103\n\fthis case. 191 He also acknowledged that the abnormal behavior he identified in the\nvideo (e.g., lack of expression, diminished interest) could have been due to the illness\nthat was reflected in the medical records from her 15-month visit. 192\n\n       Doctor Wiznitzer, on the other hand, saw no evidence of a rapid regression or\nany significant behavioral changes. 193 He elaborated that A.A.’s behavior at the\npumpkin patch on October 14 was strikingly similar to her behavior at the Halloween\nparty on October 29. 194 He also explained that any perceived differences in A.A.’s\nbehavior while at home on October 14 as compared to that at the Halloween party were\nlargely attributable to her age and personality and not evidence of a major change. 195\nHe stated that what was important from a developmental perspective was her evident\nawareness of her surroundings and of the people around her. 196 My own observations\nand conclusions are in accord with Dr. Wiznitzer’s.\n\n       Both experts agreed that by Christmastime A.A.’s behavior was clearly\nabnormal—she did not vocalize, had diminished social interaction, and engaged in\ninappropriate play. 197 However, their opinions differed as to whether the behavior was a\ncontinuum of deterioration from that seen in later October. 198 In Dr. Zimmerman’s view,\n“her condition five days after [vaccination] appeared to persist.”199 Doctor Wiznitzer\nindicated that there was insufficient evidence to find that the behaviors were a\nprogression. 200\n\n       In view of all of the evidence of record, I do not find the testimony offered by Mr.\nAllen and Ms. Edick with respect to the timeline of A.A.’s developmental deterioration to\n\n\n\n191\n      Tr. at 679.\n192\n   Tr. at 353-54; see also Tr. at 301 (Doctor Zimmerman commenting that in the October 29 video, A.A.\nlooked as though she did not feel well).\n193\n      Tr. at 493, 495.\n194\n   Tr. at 495; see also Tr. at 493 (explaining that he focused on those segments due to the similarity of\nthe environment).\n195\n  Tr. at 490 (noting a “clear difference” between her behavior and social interactions when she was at\nhome as compared to outside in public, but attributing it to stranger anxiety and shyness).\n196\n      Tr. at 494-95.\n197\n      Tr. at 303 (Dr. Zimmerman); 541-42, 605-08 (Dr. Wiznitzer).\n198\n      Tr. at 303-04 (Dr. Zimmerman); 608 (Dr. Wiznitzer).\n199\n      Tr. at 303-04.\n200\n      Tr. at 608.\n\n\n                                                     104\n\fbe reliable. I do not question their honesty; 201 I do question their recall. This was a\nfamily with easy access to health care, with a nanny who could take A.A. to the doctor\nwhen her parents were working. Despite the extremely concerning changes\ndescribed, 202 petitioners did not contact A.A.’s doctor or voice concern to any other\nmedical professional. 203 And when she was treated on December 18 for a viral infection\nand early OM, these troubling developments went unmentioned. This makes no sense.\n\n       As I noted above, petitioners were consistent in taking A.A. to the doctor when\nshe was sick, including for very minor illnesses. That they would not have reached out\nto A.A.’s pediatrician in these circumstances is inexplicable. Indeed, I note that even\nafter Mr. Allen began blaming the MMR vaccination for A.A.’s problems, the timeline\nbetween vaccination and onset was different. He reported to A.A.’s physician in early\n2002: “Her behavior started 30 days post MMR.” 204\n\n        I emphasize that I have a great deal of respect for Dr. Zimmerman as a physician\nand expert. However, I think his view of the events post-vaccination were based on and\nshaped by the history he was provided at the initial visit. The history of a rapid\nregression, one he thought atypical of ASD, meshed with his research interest in\nmitochondrial disorders and ASD. He ordered testing, and eventually treatment.\nLetting go of the basis for this course of events could be difficult. However, setting\naside the history he had been provided, when he was asked to identify medical\nevidence showing developmental abnormalities or changed behavior shortly after\nvaccination, he could not do so. 205 Doctor Zimmerman also stated that if he were to\nbase his opinion only on the October 14 and December 25 videos, without regard to the\nOctober 29 video, he would not characterize the behavioral changes he observed as\nrapid. 206 I asked him that question because of the testimony of Dr. Wiznitzer and my\nown observations that A.A.’s behavior at the pumpkin patch looked a lot like her\nbehavior at the Halloween parade and party.\n201\n   The only area in which I question Mr. Allen’s honesty is in the claim than no other videos of A.A.\nexisted, particularly in view of his testimony that he filmed her frequently.\n202\n   See Tr. at 119 (Ms. Edick stated that the behavior she saw on Veterans Day weekend “really affected\n[her].” She could not remember saying anything about her concerns to the petitioners; however, she did\nrecall discussing it with her own parents.). This, too, is inexplicable. As close as the family apparently\nwas, and given Ms. Edick’s training in special education, I find it very difficult to accept that she would\nnot—gently—have mentioned that some of A.A.’s behaviors should be discussed with her pediatrician.\nGiven petitioners’ response to the speech therapist’s suggestion that she might have ASD (she saw an\nASD specialist at Children’s Hospital in Washington, DC just 11 days later) I cannot imagine that they\nwould not have responded equally quickly to a suggestion or observation that A.A.’s behaviors were not\nnormal.\n203\n   See Tr. at 81-82; see also Tr. at 45 (In retrospect, Mr. Allen wished that he had called the doctor, but\nstated that he was not sure what he would have said.).\n204\n      Pet. Ex. 9, p. 35.\n205\n      Tr. at 348.\n206\n      Tr. at 353 (“Three months would not be rapid, no.”).\n\n\n                                                      105\n\f        Instead, I credit Dr. Wiznitzer’s opinion, as it is consistent with the\ncontemporaneous medical records. Doctor Wiznitzer persuasively explained that A.A.\nhad early signs of autism prior to vaccination 207 and that her subsequent autistic\npresentation was not atypical. 208 He testified that autism usually manifests between\nage one and two years, but symptoms are always present before age three. 209 He also\ntestified that autistic regression is not an abrupt occurrence; 210 instead, language and\nsocial skills are lost over a period of weeks to months. 211 In his view, A.A’s autistic\npresentation followed this course, beginning with delayed speech prior to vaccination\nand continuing with a gradual deterioration of social skills and other behaviors. 212 Her\neventual ASD diagnosis was fully supported by the medical records. 213\n\nC. Diagnosis of Mitochondrial Disease, Disorder, or Dysfunction.\n\n       The preponderant evidence does not support a finding that A.A. has or had a\nmitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. Doctor Kelley’s diagnosis was not\nmade using established criteria, but an unpublished method that has not been peer-\nreviewed, adopted by other laboratories, or recognized as a valid diagnostic approach\nby the mitochondrial community at large. 214 Indeed, Dr. Kelley himself stated that A.A.\nwould not meet the criteria for a mitochondrial diagnosis using established criteria. 215\n\n       Early in his treatment, Dr. Zimmerman suspected that A.A. “might have\nmitochondrial problems.” 216 The basis for this belief was her “apparently rapid\ndeterioration following her MMR vaccin[ation]”—a pattern he claimed he had seen in\nother children with mitochondrial problems. 217\n\n207\n      Tr. at 500-01.\n208\n      Tr. at 500.\n209\n      Tr. at 497.\n210\n   Tr. at 597-602 (also commenting that “an overnight story” would lead him to “start looking for other\ndisorders”).\n211\n      Tr. at 600-01.\n212\n  Tr. at 500 (also stating that even “a relatively rapid regression” would still be “within the framework of\nwhat’s been described for the population”).\n213\n      Tr. at 499.\n214\n      Tr. at 388 (Dr. Cederbaum)\n215\n      Tr. at 252.\n216\n      Tr. at 306-07.\n217\n  Tr. at 307.

Kelley and Zimmerman were treating\nphysicians. Their decision to treat A.A. based on the diagnosis of “mitochondrial\nautism” that they reached certainly attests to their belief in the diagnosis. Their belief\nthat she improved on such treatment is more difficult to assess and credit, as they\nacknowledged her positive response could not be separated from the effect of other\ntherapies she was concurrently receiving. And, to the extent that her improvement was\nbased on subjective assessments, I note that petitioners thought A.A. improved on\nchelation therapy, too, which was designed to remove heavy metals, not treat\nmitochondrial problems.\n\n       Genetic testing for mitochondrial defects was negative. That is not uncommon,\neven in children with symptoms meeting the mainstream diagnostic criteria. With the\nexception of one high alanine level on testing ordered in 2003 (after three earlier tests\nfor alanine were normal), A.A. had none of the classic markers for mitochondrial\ndisease. Although Drs. Zimmerman and Kelley thought there was a history of a sudden\nregression post MMR vaccination, based solely on parental histories, I have found that\nthere was no sudden regression.\n\n       Essentially, the “mitochondrial autism” diagnosis rests on the unpublished\nresearch of Dr. Kelley and the anecdotal observations of Dr. Zimmerman. And, Dr.\nKelley’s opinion is, in essence, based on his re-evaluation and “normalization” of the\nfindings of one outside laboratory, which reported A.A.’s results as normal, and on the\ntest results from his own laboratory, which he acknowledged were not accepted by the\nmitochondrial disease community at large.\n\n      At hearing, Dr. Kelley testified at length about his diagnostic approach, but was\nunable to cogently explain his method, which involved opaque calculations, 218 obscure\nprotocols, 219 and data accessible only to him. 220 Although he borrowed some elements\n\n\n\n\n892250, at *63-77; Snyder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">332044</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *142-47; C.

When anecdotal data connecting regression to the MMR\nis cited, it is difficult to determine if the correlation is suggestive of causation or merely coincidental. This\nproblem with Dr. Zimmerman’s data was discussed by Dr. Wiznitzer in his testimony, including references\nto the epidemiologic studies on which he relied. The epidemiology was also extensively discussed in the\nTheory 1 OAP decisions.

Kelley and Zimmerman prescribed such\ntreatment carries less weight than the decision to prescribe a drug with known side\neffects in the face of less than certain diagnosis.\n\n      I do not find Dr. Kelley’s approach to be a reliable method for diagnosing\nmitochondrial disease, disorders, or dysfunction. He has not submitted his ideas to a\nknowledgeable community of peers for judgement; his method has not been widely\nadopted or recognized as a valid diagnostic approach; and he provided only anecdotal\nevidence of reproducibility. I reject Dr. Kelley’s “bald assurance[s] of validity” and\npromises that his findings are based on sound science. 234\n\n       Although his approach might prove correct at some future date, it is not “scientific\nknowledge” just because he says so. 235 He must do the hard work of subjecting it to\npeer-review and publication and thereby earn the recognition and wide-acceptance he\nso clearly believes his method deserves. As it stands, his methods and theories cannot\nbe replicated or confirmed.\n\nD. Autism Diagnosis.\n\n       I find that A.A. has ASD. That diagnosis is consistent with her entire clinical\ncourse, from the pre-vaccination behaviors involving delayed language development,\nstereotypies, and some lack of social involvement, to the tantrums and disinterest in\nopening Christmas toys she demonstrated in the December videos, to the diminished\ninterest in play and talking her mother reported in March 2001 at her well-child visit. By\nthe time she saw a speech therapist in August 2001, she displayed enough behavioral\ndifferences that the therapist thought she had ASD. The diagnosis was essentially\nconfirmed by Dr. Lavenstein in September 2001. The diagnosis persisted. At the time\nof the hearing, A.A. was highly functioning, but still displayed issues with social\ninteraction and boundaries.\n\n                         VIII. Analysis Under Althen, Pafford and Loving.\n\n       The factual underpinnings for petitioners’ claims are absent, based on the\nfindings above. I have found that A.A. did not have a mitochondrial disease,\ndysfunction, or disorder; that she displayed subtle early symptoms of ASD prior to the\nadministration of her October 23, 2000 MMR vaccine; that she did not experience either\n232\n      Res.

The existence\nof any true regression is unlikely, as Dr. Wiznitzer indicated the term is defined.\n\nA. Althen Prong 1: A Reliable Theory.\n\n        Althen requires that a petitioner in an off-Table causation case present a reliable\nmedical theory by explaining how the vaccines administered can cause the injury in\nquestion. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278. This first prong of Althen’s three part causation test\nhas also been characterized as the equivalent of the “Can it cause?” inquiry used in\ntoxic tort litigation. See Pafford, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1717359</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n\n        The medical theory must be a reputable one, although it need only be “legally\nprobable, not medically or scientifically certain.” Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49. The\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Daubert likewise requires that courts determine expert\nopinions to be reliable before they may be considered as evidence. “In short, the\nrequirement that an expert’s testimony pertain to ‘scientific knowledge’ establishes a\nstandard of evidentiary reliability.” 509 U.S. at 590 (footnote omitted). The Federal\nCircuit has stated that a “special master is entitled to require some indicia of reliability to\nsupport the assertion of the expert witness.” Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1324.\n\n       1. Petitioners’ Theory\n\n        Petitioners claim that A.A.—“born with a susceptibility to mitochondrial\nmetabolism dysfunction, regressed and suffered mitochondrial autism” as the result of\nher MMR vaccine received on October 23, 2000. See Petitioners’ Post-Hearing Brief,\nfiled Nov. 27, 2013, at 1. Alternatively, “petitioners allege, the MMR vaccine\nsignificantly aggravated [a]n underlying condition, mitochondrial metabolism\ndysfunction, resulting in mitochondrial autism.” Id.\n\n        The theory that a child with an underlying mitochondrial disorder can experience\na febrile illness and thereafter decompensate is not seriously disputed in this claim.\nHowever, petitioners’ experts significantly expand upon that theory to postulate what\namounts to an untested hypothesis. Petitioner’s theory has two distinct components: (1)\nthat children with certain specific biochemical findings have a mitochondrial disorder;\nand (2) that these children can experience a vaccine-caused or aggravated regression\nand subsequently develop a condition that looks like autism—the “mitochondrial autism”\ndiagnosed by Dr. Kelley. Petitioners have failed to offer preponderant evidence of\neither component.\n\n             a. Specific biochemical findings are not reliable evidence of a\nmitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction in children.\n\n       Doctor Kelley found that A.A. had a mitochondrial disorder based upon certain\nbiochemical findings. However, I have found that the preponderant evidence does not\nestablish that A.A. had a mitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. The Supreme\nCourt in Daubert indicated that scientific knowledge “connotes more than subjective\n\n\n                                              110\n\fbelief or unsupported speculation.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 590. “[T]estimony must be\nsupported by appropriate validation – i.e., ‘good grounds,’ based on what is known.” Id.\nThe Supreme Court has provided a non-exhaustive list of factors federal courts may\nconsider, including whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the\nscientific community; whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication;\nwhether it can be and has been tested; and whether the known potential rate of error is\nacceptable. Daubert, 43 F.3d at 1316, on remand from, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993) (citing\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 592-94).\n\n       This diagnosis was based upon biochemical findings that were not interpreted\nusing established criteria, but an unpublished method that has not been peer-reviewed,\nadopted by other laboratories, or recognized as a valid diagnostic approach by the\nmitochondrial community at large. It is possible that at some time in the future Dr.\nKelley will be able to support his theory that certain biochemical findings are evidence of\na mitochondrial disorder, but at this time I find insufficient indicia of reliability for this\ntheory for me to credit it. As Dr. Cederbaum has observed, Dr. Kelley has propounded\nthe theory that these biochemical findings always equate to an electron transport chain\ndysfunction for 15 years, but has yet to publish the proof. That proof should come\nbefore a court relies upon it.\n\n       For me, one of the most concerning aspects of the lack of publication and\nexplication to the other experts in the field is that the error rate is unknown. Doctor\nKelley’s testimony did not convince me that he had established adequate controls. For\nexample, it would be useful to know not only how neurotypical individuals fare on this\ntesting, but how children with other neurological problems, and children with ASD not\ninvolving regression fare. I note that in the Theory 2 OAP cases, petitioners relied on a\n2004 study by Dr. Jill James showing altered plasma metabolites in children with ASD\nas compared to age-matched control children. Because 19 of the 20 children with ASD\nhad regression, the authors (and the petitioners) concluded that the altered metabolites\ncontributed to their regression. However, there was no basis to imply that the children\nwith regression were metabolically different from those without regression, as only one\nchild without regression was tested. More fundamentally, the authors noted that\nchildren with Down syndrome (an entirely genetic condition) had metabolic profiles more\nsimilar to the ASD children to than the neurotypical controls. See Dwyer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">892250</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *134 (subpart c, discussing the James studies). I am not considering this\nstudy as substantive evidence in this case; I reference it to demonstrate concerns about\nrelying on unpublished data as evidence.\n\n             b. No preponderant evidence that the MMR vaccination can cause\nregression and “mitochondrial autism” in children with mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n       Assuming that I accepted Dr. Kelley’s theory that specific biochemical findings\nare evidence of mitochondrial a disease, disorder, or dysfunction in children—which I do\nnot—petitioners have still failed to present preponderant evidence that that the MMR\nvaccination can cause regression and “mitochondrial autism” in children with a\nmitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. The evidence on this component of\n\n\n                                             111\n\fpetitioners’ theory is too scant to be reliable. Doctor Kelley asserted that in children\nwith mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation caused by a stressor—such as an\ninfection, a virus, or a vaccine—can cause neurological damage. Tr. at 216-17. Doctor\nKelley stated that in his clinical experience, “if there is an identifiable event or\nidentifiable time frame in which regression occurs, the factor that links it is\ninflammation.” Tr. at 217. He opined that cytokines are involved in the inflammatory\nresponse—particularly, TNF-α, a cytokine that induces apoptosis, or cell death. Tr. at\n216-22. Doctor Kelley asserted “that the peak level of TNF-alpha following\nimmunization with the measles component of the MMR is between 10 and 15 days.”\nPet. Ex. 23 at 3 (citing Poland, Pet. Ex. 71).\n\n       However, Dr. Wiznitzer cogently explained that in Poland, Pet. Ex. 71, for the first\n15 days following vaccination—the critical time period according to Dr. Kelley—none of\nthe values for IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-α secretion rose above their baseline. Tr. at 508.\nDoctor Wiznitzer elaborated “the [Poland] paper itself state[d] that there was no\nappreciable change in the cytokine levels” for the toddler group. Tr. at 510. There is\nsimply no credible evidence that inflammation caused by vaccination plays a role in the\ndevelopment of regression and/or mitochondrial autism in children with mitochondrial\ndysfunction. Doctor Zimmerman in fact conceded that “I don’t think we can say at this\npoint that in any one individual that inflammation is the cause of autism.” Tr. at 320-21.\n\n       While it is uncontested that illnesses and other stressors can cause\ndecompensation or regression in children with inborn errors of metabolism, that\nphenomenon has been observed most frequently in children with urea cycle disorders\n— a condition that A.A. most assuredly does not have. Whether vaccination can do so,\neven in these most vulnerable children, has not been established, and the available\nevidence, most particularly the Morgan study, Res. Ex. C, failed to find evidence that\nthey could.\n\n       The most glaring problem, however, is that no evidence adduced in this case,\nother than the anecdotally based opinions of Dr. Zimmerman, demonstrates that the\ndecompensation or regression induced by illness in children with metabolic or\nmitochondrial disorders looks like, mimics, or actually results in ASD. Children with\nASD may have co-morbid diagnoses of intellectual disability, mitochondrial disorders,\nseizure disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, attention deficit disorders, and many\nothers, but the presence of these other conditions does not automatically equate to a\ncausal relationship.\n\n              c. Conclusion\n\n        I find that petitioners have failed to present preponderant evidence of a reliable\nmedical theory by explaining how the MMR vaccine can cause or significantly aggravate\nthe injury in question.

Althen Prong 2: A Logical Connection.\n\n       Even if petitioners had provided a theory which satisfied the first prong, to satisfy\nthe second prong of the Althen test, petitioners must establish a “logical sequence of\ncause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury.” Althen,\n418 F.3d at 1278. In other words, petitioners must show that the received vaccine did,\nmore likely than not, cause the injury in the case at bar. Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1356. The\nsequence of cause and effect need only be “‘logical’ and legally probable, not medically\nor scientifically certain.” Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49; accord Capizzano, 440 F.3d at\n1326. Evidence from a treating physician may assist petitioner in meeting her burden of\nproof under the second Althen prong. Capizzano, 440 F.3d at 1326.\n\n        Petitioners have failed to show a logical connection between A.A.’s vaccination\nand her injury, or the significant aggravation of her injury. Based on the totality of the\nevidence, as discussed above, I have found that A.A. was not developing normally prior\nto her vaccination as evidenced by her delayed speech, and abnormal behavior,\nincluding hand flapping and limited eye contact on display in the October 14, 2000\nvideo. See Section VII. 2, supra. After A.A’s vaccination, it is unlikely that she\nexperienced the acute febrile illness that petitioners claim. There is no reliable evidence\nof the type of rapid regression that might signal to a neurologist that something\nsignificant had happened. As Dr. Wiznitzer, a specialist who has diagnosed hundreds\nof children with ASD testified, a precipitous regression would cause him to look for\nsomething other than ASD as a cause. However, the evidence in this case supports the\nslower onset of social and language concerns. In particular, I rely on A.A.’s mother’s\nreport at her March 2001 well-child visit, wherein she described problems developing\nover a period of months, to demonstrate that there was no precipitous or rapid\nregression. See Section VII. 3 and 4, supra. Rather, as discussed, I accept the\ntestimony of Dr. Wiznitzer that the behavior exhibited by A.A. on the portions of the\nOctober 14 and October 29 videos taken in similar circumstances is strikingly similar;\nthat A.A. exhibited signs and symptoms of autism prior to her vaccination; and that, after\nher vaccination, A.A. followed the typical course seen in ASD. See Section VII. 4,\nsupra.\n\n        Accordingly, I find that petitioners have failed to establish a logical sequence of\ncause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury” or the\nsignificant aggravation of a preexisting injury.

Althen Prong 3: A Proximate Temporal Connection.\n\n        Merely showing a proximate temporal connection between a vaccination and an\ninjury is insufficient, standing alone, to establish causation.

Cir. 1992). A proximate temporal relationship, even when\ncoupled with the absence of any other identified cause for the injury, is not enough to\ndemonstrate probable cause under the Vaccine Act’s preponderance standard.\nMoberly, 592 F.3d at 1323 (citing Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278).\n\n\n                                            113\n\f         Petitioners have failed to establish a proximate temporal relationship between\nA.A.’s October 23, 2000 MMR vaccination and the onset of her injury, or the significant\naggravation of any preexisting injury. Doctor Kelley opined that the “most important\nfact linking [A.A.’s] deterioration to her MMR vaccination is that the peak level of TNF-\nalpha following immunization with the measles component of the MMR is between 10\nand 15 days.” Pet. Ex. 23 at 3 (citing Poland, Pet. Ex. 71). Doctor Kelley testified that\n“the few children that I’ve seen who have regressed with – based on evidence that\nthey’ve regressed with the MMR, it was at 10 to 14 days after the immunization, which .\n. . [coincides with] the peak cytokine response.” Tr. at 225; see also Tr. at 279-81\n(redirect).\n\n          However, as discussed in my Althen prong one analysis, Dr. Wiznitzer cogently\nexplained that in Poland, Pet. Ex. 71, for the first 15 days following vaccination—the\ncritical time period according to Dr. Kelley—none of the values for IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-\nalpha secretion rose above their baseline.” Tr. at 508. Doctor Wiznitzer elaborated that\n“the [Poland] paper itself state[d] that there was no appreciable change in the cytokine\nlevels” for the toddler group, and thus Dr. Kelley’s reliance on this article is erroneous.\nTr. at 510.\n\n       Further, even if petitioners’ had established that a medically appropriate time\nperiod for the onset of A.A.’s injury was between 10 and 15 days subsequent to her\nvaccination, I have found no evidence that A.A. experienced an acute illness on October\n29, 2000, marked by a spiking fever, continuing for four days, and precipitating a\ndevelopmental regression. See Section VII. 3 and 4, supra.\n\n        Accordingly, I find that petitioners have failed to demonstrate a medically\nacceptable proximate temporal relationship between A.A.’s vaccination and injury or the\nsignificant aggravation of any preexisting injury.\n\nD. The Additional Loving Factors\n\n       As disused above, I found that petitioners have failed to establish that A.A.\nsuffered a mitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction. Therefore, petitioners cannot\nhave established that A.A.’s October 23, 2000 MMR vaccination significantly\naggravated a mitochondrial disease, disorder, or dysfunction.\n\n       However, I will briefly address the additional Loving factors necessary to proving\nsuch a claim. 236 To demonstrate aggravation of a pre-existing condition, petitioners\nmust show: (1) the vacinee’s condition prior to the administration of the vaccine, (2) the\nvacinee’s current condition, and (3) whether the vacinee’s current condition constitutes\na “significant aggravation” of the condition prior to the vaccination. See Loving v. HHS,\n\n\n\n236\n   The Loving test is a six part test. However, the final three parts are virtually identical to the Althen\nfactors and are addressed above within my Althen analysis.\n\n                                                      114\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Cl. 2009) (combining the first three Whitecotton 237 factors for\nclaims regarding aggravation of a Table injury with the three Althen factors for off table\ninjury claims to create a six-part test for off Table aggravation claims); see also W.C.,\n704 F.3d at 1357 (applying the six-part Loving test.).\n\n       In this case I have determined that A.A. was not developing normally prior to her\nvaccination, as she exhibited signs and symptoms of autism; that A.A. experienced no\ndramatic regression or acute event following her October 23, 2000 MMR vaccination,\nand that after her vaccination A.A.’s development followed a course typical of autism.\nSee Section VII., supra. Accordingly, I find that petitioners have not established that\nA.A.’s current condition or her condition after vaccination constitutes a “significant\naggravation” of her condition prior to her vaccination. Petitioners have satisfied neither\nthe Althen test for vaccine causation, nor the Loving test for significant aggravation of a\npre-existing injury.\n\n                                            IX. Conclusion.\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, I find that petitioners have not met their burden\nunder Althen. They did not demonstrate any of the Althen factors by preponderant\nevidence.
