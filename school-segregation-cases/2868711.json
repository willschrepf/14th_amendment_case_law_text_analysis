DeHart (\"DeHart\"), an\ninmate at the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institute\n(\"SCI\") at Greene, commenced this civil rights action\nagainst Martin Horn, Commissioner of the Department of\nCorrections of Pennsylvania, and James Price,\nSuperintendent of SCI at Greene (collectively \"the prison\" or\n\"prison officials\"), as a result of their failure to provide him\nwith a diet consistent with his Buddhist religious beliefs.\nDeHart appeals the final order of the District Court,\ngranting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. He\ninsists that the defendants' failure to accommodate his\nreligious belief, which requires him to follow a vegetarian\ndiet, violates both his right to free religious expression\nunder the First Amendment and his right to equal\nprotection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. We\nwill reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                  2\n\fI.\n\nDeHart is currently serving a life sentence at SCI at\nGreene. Since his incarceration, he, with the assistance of\nthe City of 10,000 Buddhas, a center of Buddhist teaching,\nhas taught himself Buddhism. Based on his own reading of\nthe Sutras, which are Buddhist religious texts, DeHart\nbecame a vegetarian. DeHart testified before the District\nCourt that the First Precept in Buddhism prohibits the\nkilling of any living thing, and he has interpreted that\nPrecept as requiring that he follow a vegetarian diet. The\nprison officials do not challenge the sincerity of DeHart's\nbeliefs. They do, however, challenge whether vegetarianism\nis a central tenet of any recognized Buddhist sect.\n\nA brief overview of the process by which Pennsylvania\nprisons provide meals to inmates is necessary for a proper\nunderstanding of DeHart's request. Pursuant to a master\nmenu, all inmates at SCI Greene receive the same meals.\nThe food for those meals is obtained through bulk\npurchases. Those inmates whose health requires dietary\nmodifications or restrictions receive a therapeutic diet. In\norder for an inmate to receive a therapeutic diet, however,\nit must be prescribed by an institution doctor. The\ntherapeutic diet consists of the same foods (in different\nproportions) that are served on the master menu. The\ntherapeutic meals are prepared individually, and all\ninmates who have been prescribed a therapeutic diet eat\ntogether in one dining hall after it has been cleared of the\nother inmates.\n\nDeHart proposes that he be served a vegetarian meal\nwhen other inmates are served the therapeutic meals.\nDeHart secured the affidavit of a dietician, who averred that\nDeHart's nutritional needs could be satisfied by doubling\nthe portions of vegetables and grains already served and\nthen adding an eight-ounce cup of a soy-based milk\nproduct at each meal.1 The cost of this supplement, which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. As the affidavit of DeHart's dietician notes, his proposed diet does\nnot\nmeet the Recommended Daily Allowance (\"RDA\") standards for Vitamin\nD, riboflavin, B-6, and zinc as set forth by the National Academy of\nSciences and adopted by the American Correctional Association. As she\n\n                               3\n\fis not currently purchased by the Department of\nCorrections (\"DOC\"), would be $1.71 per day.2\n\nOn June 17, 1995, DeHart submitted a written grievance,\nrequesting a diet that comports with his religious beliefs.\nThat grievance was denied, and DeHart appealed the denial\nto Superintendent Price, who concurred in the result. The\ndenial was again upheld on appeal by the DOC Central\nOffice Review Committee. DeHart then filed this suit\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983.\n\nA preliminary injunction hearing was held before a\nMagistrate Judge, who found that vegetarianism is not\nmandated by Buddhism and, for that reason, recommended\nthat DeHart be denied preliminary relief. The District Court\nadopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation. DeHart\nthen appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the denial of\npreliminary injunctive relief. See DeHart v. Horn, No. 97-\n3048 (3d Cir. Aug. 25, 1997) (hereinafter \"Memorandum\nOpinion\"). In the Memorandum Opinion affirming the\nDistrict Court's decision, this Court admonished the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nexplained, it did provide more than two-thirds of the RDA standard in\neach instance, and these deficiencies did not cause her to qualify her\nopinion that the proposed diet was sufficient to meet DeHart's\nnutritional needs. The District Court made no findings regarding the\nsignificance, if any, of these deficiencies. The Pennsylvania DOC Food\nServices Administrative Directive requires that, for the master menu, a\nregistered dietician verify that the diet \"meets or exceeds the dietary\nallowances as stated in the [RDAs] . . . .\" App. 652. For the therapeutic\ndiets, however, the regulation merely requires that the diet \"be designed\nand certified by a Registered Dietician as being nutritionally correct.\"\nApp. 656. The regulation also provides that it \"should be interpreted to\nhave sufficient flexibility so as to be consistent with law . . . .\" App.\n657.\nOn remand, the District Court may find it necessary to determine how\nthis Administrative Directive should be interpreted in a context like\nthis.\nIf it should determine that the proposed diet is inconsistent with the\nAdministrative Directive, however, the issue would remain whether\nunder Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), the prison rules and\nregulations as a whole, as applied to this case, are reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\n\n2. The dietician indicated that a day's supply of soy-based milk product\nwould cost $1.71 if purchased in a supermarket and would cost less if\npurchased directly from a distributor.\n\n                               4\n\fDistrict Court not to interject itself into Buddhist doctrinal\ndisputes: \"We agree with [DeHart] that the district court\ncould properly determine only whether he sincerely held his\nreligious beliefs, not whether his beliefs are doctrinally\ncorrect or central to a particular school of Buddhist\nteaching.\" Memorandum Opinion at 2 (citing Employment\nDivision v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 886-87 (1990)).\n\nOn remand, the parties engaged in additional discovery,\nand cross-motions for summary judgment were filed. The\nMagistrate Judge recommended that summary judgment be\ngranted in favor of the prison officials. DeHartfiled\nobjections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and\nRecommendation, arguing, inter alia, that the Magistrate\nJudge ignored this Court's instructions and again based his\nopinion on a finding that vegetarianism is not a central\ntenet of the Buddhist religion. The District Court adopted\nthe Report and Recommendation over that objection, and\nthis appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\nThe District Court had jurisdiction over this case,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1331, and this Court has\njurisdiction over the present appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court's\ndecision to grant summary judgment. See Wicker v. Consol.\nRail Corp., 142 F.3d 690, 696 (3d Cir. 1998). Summary\njudgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact, and the moving party is entitled to a\njudgment as a matter of law. See id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\nIn our review, we must view all evidence and draw all\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party. See Wicker, 142 F.3d at 696.\n\nIII.\n\nThe First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make\nno law respecting an establishment of religion, or\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .\" U.S. Const.\namend. I. In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303\n(1940), the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment\nwas incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment and, thus,\n\n                                5\n\fapplicable to the states. Although DeHart is incarcerated,\nthe Supreme Court has made clear that \"convicted\nprisoners do not forfeit all constitutional protections by\nreason of their conviction and confinement in prison.\" Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545 (1979). \"Inmates clearly\nretain protections afforded by the First Amendment, . . .\nincluding its directive that no law shall prohibit the free\nexercise of religion.\" O'Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348\n(1987) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, the fact of\nincarceration and the valid penological objectives of\ndeterrence of crime, rehabilitation of prisoners, and\ninstitutional security require certain limitations on the\nexercise of constitutional rights by inmates. See Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822-23 (1974).\n\nIn Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), the Supreme\nCourt articulated the standard for reviewing a prison\nregulation challenged on constitutional grounds: \"[W]hen a\nprison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional\nrights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\" This test is intended to\neffect an accommodation between two well-established\nprinciples. \"The first of these principles is that federal\ncourts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional\nclaims of prison inmates.\" Id. at 84. The\"second . . . is the\nrecognition that `courts are ill equipped to deal with the\nincreasingly urgent problems of prison administration' and\n[that] separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of\njudicial restraint.\" Id. at 84-85 (quoting Procunier v.\nMartinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974)). Thus, while this\nstandard of review requires a court to respect the security,\nrehabilitation and administrative concerns underlying a\nprison regulation, without requiring proof that the\nregulation is the least restrictive means of addressing those\nconcerns, it also requires a court to give weight, in\nassessing the overall reasonableness of regulations, to the\ninmate's interest in engaging in constitutionally protected\nactivity.\n\nTurner goes on to provide guidance on how to apply its\nreasonableness standard. As we recently explained in\nWaterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(internal citations omitted):\n\n                               6\n\f       [Turner] directs courts to assess the overall\n       reasonableness of such regulations by weighing four\n       factors. \"First, there must be a `valid, rational\n       connection' between the prison regulation and the\n       legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify\n       it,\" and this connection must not be \"so remote as to\n       render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\" Second, a\n       court must consider whether inmates retain alternative\n       means of exercising the circumscribed right. Third, a\n       court must take into account the costs that\n       accommodating the right would impose on other\n       inmates, guards, and prison resources generally. And\n       fourth, a court must consider whether there are\n       alternatives to the regulation that \"fully accommodate[ ]\n       the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid\n       penological interests.\"\n\n1. Rational Connection to Penological Interests\n\nThe prison asserts that two penological interests are\nserved by denying DeHart's request for a vegetarian diet: (1)\nthe interest in a simplified and efficient food service; and (2)\nthe interest in avoiding possible resentment and jealousy\non the part of other inmates. The District Court found that\nthe denial of DeHart's religious diet was rationally related to\nthose two legitimate, penological goals. Given the deference\nwe must show to the reasoned judgment of prison officials\nand our recent decision in Johnson v. Horn, 150 F.3d 276\n(3d Cir. 1998), we agree.\n\nIn Johnson, two Pennsylvania prison inmates sued prison\nofficials, alleging a violation of their free exercise rights. The\ninmates were Jewish and were seeking a kosher diet in\nconformity with their religious beliefs. In that case,\nhowever, the prison officials conceded that the inmates\nwere entitled to receive a kosher diet; the only issue was\nwhether that diet had to consist of hot or cold meals. See\nid. at 281. This Court, thus, never addressed the\nfundamental issue in this case -- i.e., whether the prison is\nconstitutionally required to serve a diet that conforms with\nDeHart's religious beliefs. Nevertheless, the Court's analysis\nis helpful here.\n\nIn Johnson, the Court specifically held that \"[t]he Prison\nhas a legitimate penological interest in keeping its food\n\n                                7\n\fservice system as simple as possible.\" Id. at 282; see also\nWard v. Walsh, 1 F.3d 873, 877 (9th Cir. 1993) (same);\nKahey v. Jones, 836 F.2d 948, 949-50 (5th Cir. 1988)\n(same). We further observed that the inmates' \"request for\na [religious diet] creates legitimate security concerns,\nincluding bringing additional foods from new sources into\nthe Prison and the possible belief by other inmates that\n[plaintiffs] are receiving special treatment.\" Johnson, 150\nF.3d at 282.\n\nJohnson, thus, forecloses any argument as to the\nlegitimacy of a prison's interest in an efficient food system\nor in avoiding inmate jealousy; those interests are\nlegitimate penological concerns under Turner. Moreover, we\nagree that the prison's refusal to grant DeHart's request for\na religious diet bears some rational relation to those\nconcerns. The fifty-five therapeutic trays prepared at each\nmeal complicates the food service regimen of the prison,\nand preparation of additional special meals would add\nincrementally to the burden. Similarly, while the evidence\nindicates that the provision of therapeutic meals has never\ngiven rise to problems in the past, it is not irrational to\nthink that providing DeHart with a vegetarian diet to\naccommodate his religious beliefs might involve some risk\nof inmate jealousy.\n\nThis determination commences rather than concludes\nour inquiry for two reasons. First, while a rational nexus\nbetween a regulation and a legitimate penological interest is\nessential to its validity, see Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90, not\nall prison regulations that are rationally related to such an\ninterest pass Turner's \"overall reasonableness\" standard.\nTurner, thus, calls for more than traditional rational basis\nreview. As the remaining factors evidence, the Turner\nstandard also takes into account the extent of the burden\nimposed by the regulation on an inmate's religious\nexpression, as well as the impact that accommodating the\ninmate's constitutional claim would have on the entire\nprison community and its resources.\n\nSecond, Turner teaches that the \"governmental objective\nmust be [both] a legitimate and neutral one.\" Id. at 90\n(emphasis added). The Court \"found it important to inquire\nwhether prison regulations restricting inmates' First\n\n                                8\n\fAmendment rights operated in a neutral fashion, without\nregard to the content of the expression.\" Id. DeHart brought\nto the District Court's attention the fact that the defendants\nin Johnson had urged a judge and a magistrate judge of the\nsame court not to order them to provide kosher meals to\nJewish inmates because the prison was voluntarily\nproviding such a diet. DeHart further pointed out that the\nkosher diet being voluntarily provided consisted of milk,\nuncut fruit and vegetables, and a nutritional supplement,\nand that the cost to the prison for these kosher meals was\nsubstantially more than the cost of the liquid supplement\ndiet he was requesting.3 The defendants comment on these\nfacts only in response to DeHart's Equal Protection\nargument. Their sole response is: \"In Johnson, the Court\nwas presented with kosher laws that are a commandment\nof the Orthodox Jewish faith. . . . Here, vegetarianism while\nan expression of belief, is not a commandment of\nBuddhism.\" Appellees' Br. at 29.\n\nWhile the District Court did not comment on the fact that\nthe defendants were providing specially prepared kosher\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. DeHart also called to the Court's attention the following observations\nof the District Court during the initial stage of the Johnson case:\n\n        The facts as to which there is no genuine dispute may be\n        summarized as follows: 1) keeping kosher is a religious obligation\n        central to the practice of Orthodox Jews, including plaintiffs; 2)\n        although there are increased dollar costs associated with\n        accommodating a kosher diet, those costs are not significant in\nlight\n        of the nature of the diet which plaintiffs testified they could eat\nand\n       remain kosher in accordance with the advice of their religious\n       leaders; 3) there are no realistic grounds for believing that\n       accommodating the plaintiffs' kosher diet will have any impact on\n       the defendants' legitimate goals of maintaining institutional order\n       and safety, and the marginal administrative costs of separating\n       genuine from false claims that a prisoner is an Orthodox Jew who\n       is required to keep kosher, in light of the administrative\napparatus\n       already in place in the Department of Corrections, is minimal.\n\n       I conclude that there is a constitutional right for these\nplaintiffs as\n       Orthodox Jews to keep kosher as described in the evidentiary record\n       of this case, i.e., to a kosher diet not requiring the\nestablishment of\n       a separate kitchen or segregated handling procedures.\n\nApp. at 152.\n\f9\n\fmeals with nutritional supplements to the Jewish inmates\nat greater cost, we assume that it must have accepted the\ndistinction tendered by the defense. As we explain\nhereafter, the proffered distinction is untenable. If, on\nremand, the District Court can articulate no other reason\nwhy DeHart and the Jewish inmates are not similarly\nsituated, it must enter judgment for DeHart. As we have\nnoted, neutrality in the regulation of religious expression is\na sine qua non of validity under Turner.4\n\n2. Alternative Means of Religious Expression\n\nThis factor requires a court to focus on the burden that\nthe regulation imposes on an inmate's ability to engage in\nconstitutionally protected activity. Turner instructs that\nwhere \" `other avenues' remain available for the exercise of\nthe asserted right, . . . courts should be particularly\nconscious of the `measure of judicial deference owed to\ncorrections officials . . . in gauging the validity of the\nregulation.' \" Turner, 482 U.S. at 90 (quoting Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. at 827). Conversely, where the\nregulation leaves no alternative means of exercising the\nasserted right, the inmate's interest in engaging in the\nprohibited activity is entitled to greater weight in the\nbalancing process.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. We agree with the dissent that a court must examine whether the\ninterest asserted as a justification for the regulation is \"unrelated to\nthe\nsuppression of expression.\" Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 215 (3d\nCir. 1999) (quoting Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 415 (1989)). The\ninquiry cannot stop there, however. As we have pointed out above,\nimmediately after setting forth the \"neutrality\" requirement, the Turner\nCourt stressed that it was \"important to inquire whether prison\nregulations restricting inmates' First Amendment rights operated in a\nneutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression.\" Turner,\n482 U.S. at 90 (emphasis added); see also Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 420\n(finding regulations facially valid under the Turner standard, but\nremanding \"for an examination of the validity of the regulations as\napplied\"). The fundamental inquiry under Turner is whether what the\nprison is doing is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\nand we are confident that the Court did not mean to suggest that such\na relationship can exist where a prison, without substantial justification\nrelated to legitimate, penological interests, chooses to accommodate the\nreligious dietary needs of Jewish inmates while refusing to accommodate\nan inmate of another faith.\n\n                               10\n\fIn Johnson, we applied this teaching in the context of an\nasserted right to a diet in conformity with one's religious\nbeliefs. There we contrasted situations involving alternative\nmeans of religious expression with situations involving\nreligious commandments that the prison regulation\nrequires the inmate to violate. We explained:\n\n       [T]he importance of alternative means of religious\n       observance is an irrelevant consideration when the\n       belief at issue is a \"religious commandment,\" rather\n       than a \"positive expression of belief.\" [ Ward v. Walsh,\n       1 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 1993)] (discussing Jewish\n       kosher laws). As the United States Court of Appeals for\n       the Ninth Circuit has stated: \"It is one thing to curtail\n       various ways of expressing belief, for which alternative\n       ways of expressing belief may be found. It is another\n       thing to require a believer to defile himself, according\n       to the believer's conscience, by doing something that is\n       completely forbidden by the believer's religion.\" Id. As\n       in Ward, the Inmates here are \"defiling\" themselves\n       under the laws of kosher when forced to eat non-\n       kosher foods. By acknowledging this, we do not intend\n       to suggest that all \"religious commandments\" must be\n       accommodated, whatever their costs to legitimate\n       penological concerns. However, in such situations the\n       centrality of the religious tenet carries greater weight\n       and the existence of alternative means of observance is\n       of no use in the ultimate balancing which Turner\n       commands.\n\nJohnson, 150 F.3d at 282.\n\nThe District Court erroneously interpreted the distinction\nwe drew in Johnson as calling for an assessment of whether\nvegetarianism was a \"central tenet\" of Buddhism or some\nrecognized sect thereof. In the course of its analysis, the\nCourt relied heavily on the testimony of Richard McKinney,\nan expert in the doctrine and practices of Buddhism, at the\npreliminary injunction hearing. Based on that testimony, it\nmade the following findings:\n\n       Plaintiff practices Mahayana Buddhism, which is one\n       of three major traditions of Buddhist practice, along\n       with the Hinayana and Vajrayana traditions. . . . He\n\n                               11\n\f       has obtained information from the City of Ten\n       Thousand Buddhists in this respect. Mr. McKinney\n       spoke to two members of the Board of Directors for the\n       City of Ten Thousand Buddhas immediately prior to\n       the hearing in this matter, and they informed him that\n       vegetarianism is a \"branch, not a root of their\n       particular approach to Buddhism.\"[5]\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Mr. McKinney gave the following explanation of the \"branch, not root\"\nconcept:\n\n        Q. What do you mean by that?\n\n        A. By that I mean that it is not a root practice, it is a -- like a\n        branch on a tree, it is a -- a practice that one can engage in.\nThey\n        happen to engage in that practice.\n\n        Q. Who are they?\n\n        A. Both the monk and the nun that I was talking about.\n\n        Q. Are they within the City of Ten Thousand Buddhists?\n\n        A. They're part of the organization.\n\n        * * *\n\n        Q. With the experience that you have, do you consider the strict\n        vegetarian practice as it is practiced within the City of Ten\n        Thousand Buddhas to be a high form of practice within Buddhism?\n\n        A. I'm hesitating because the idea of higher or lower practice, in\n        which I just said, is -- the root practices have to do with the\n        precepts. The vegetarianism is not higher, it is just a practice\nwhich\n        grows out of the precept of not harming.\n\n        Q. Okay. Is vegetarianism mandated by Buddhism?\n\n        A. No.\n\nApp. at 104-05.\n\nOn cross-examination, Mr. McKinney further testified:\n\n        Q. Do some Buddhists practice vegetarianism as a matter of\n        religious belief or conviction?\n\n        A. Yes.\n\fQ. Okay. And, in fact, isn't it the case that the-- that the monks\nor some people associated with the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas\npractice vegetarianism?\n\n                        12\n\f       While supporting plaintiff 's right to pursue Buddhism\n       as plaintiff understands it, Mr. McKinney stated that\n       no one practice is an absolute necessity for Buddhism,\n       and that one should \"practice what one is able to\n       practice within the environment and conditions that\n       one can.\" Mr. McKinney also opined that sutras are\n       guidelines, and that plaintiff is interpreting them\"in a\n       very literalistic manner.\"\n\n       What the court is faced with, then, is a situation where\n       plaintiff may sincerely believe that he would defile\n       himself by not following the strict vegetarian diet he\n       has described. His belief, however, is clearly not shared\n       by any other Buddhist identified to the court, and is\n       specifically rejected as a \"central\" tenet by the very sect\n       of Buddhists to which plaintiff has appealed for\n       guidance in the past.\n\n       * * *\n\n       Since vegetarianism is neither a central part of\n       Buddhism, nor a commandment of that religion,\n       plaintiff 's wish to pursue vegetarianism must be\n       considered an expression of his faith as opposed to his\n       adherence to a religious commandment. This being the\n       case, the existence of alternative means of expression,\n       including prayer and possession of religious texts,\n       makes this factor one which weighs in the prison's\n       favor as well.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. And isn't it the case that at least some of the people in the\nCity\n       of Ten Thousand Buddhas perform the custom where they eat one\n       vegetarian meal before noon or early in the day and that's the only\n       meal that they eat?\n\n       A. There are many Teravadan monks who do the same.\n\n       Q. Okay. And that's a function of their religious conviction and\n       religious belief, is that correct?\n\n       A. It's a function of their religious practice.\n\nApp. at 106-07.\n\n                               13\n\fDistrict Court Slip Op. at 16, 17 (internal citations omitted).\n\nThe District Court's reliance on the fact that DeHart's\nbeliefs are not shared by others in the Buddhist religion is\ninconsistent with both Supreme Court caselaw and the\nprecedent of this Court. As the Supreme Court cautioned in\nEmployment Division v. Smith:\n\n       \"[I]t is not within the judicial ken to question the\n       centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or\n       the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of\n       those creeds.\" Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S.\n       [680,] 699 [(1989)]. Repeatedly and in many different\n       contexts, we have warned that courts must not\n       presume to determine the place of a particular belief in\n       a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.\n\n494 U.S. 872, 886-87 (1990) (plurality opinion). Although\nthe Court was divided in Smith, the concurring and\ndissenting opinions both expressly agreed with the\nmajority's admonition. See id. at 906 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (\"I agree with the Court . . . [that] `[i]t is not\nwithin the judicial ken to question the centrality of\nparticular beliefs or practices to a faith.' \") (quoting\nHernandez); id. at 919 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\"I agree\n. . . that courts should refrain from delving into questions\nwhether, as a matter of religious doctrine, a particular\npractice is `central' to the religion\").\n\nSmith is not an aberration. Rather, it is part of a\nconsistent and resounding theme echoed throughout many\nSupreme Court opinions. See Thomas v. Review Bd. of\nIndiana Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 715-16\n(1981) (\"[T]he guarantee of free exercise is not limited to\nbeliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious\nsect. . . . [I]t is not within the judicial function and judicial\ncompetence to inquire [who has] more correctly perceived\nthe commands of their common faith.\"); Jones v. Wolf, 443\nU.S. 595, 602-06 (1979); Presbyterian Church in U.S. v.\nMary Elizabeth Blue Hull Mem. Presbyterian Church, 393\nU.S. 440, 450 (1969) (\"the First Amendment forbids . . .\ncourts from . . . assessing the relative significance to the\nreligion of the tenets\"); United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S.\n78, 85-87 (1944).\n\n                               14\n\fThe course to be followed in a case of this kind was\ncharted by this Court in Africa v. Pennsylvania, 662 F.2d\n1025 (3d Cir. 1981), which also involved an inmate's\nrequest for a special diet said to be mandated by the Free\nExercise Clause. The inmate was a member of MOVE, \" `a\nrevolutionary' organization, `absolutely opposed to all that\nis wrong.' \" Id. at 1026. We there posed the issues for\ndecision as follows:\n\n       The relevant case law in the free exercise area suggests\n       that two threshold requirements must be met before\n       particular beliefs, alleged to be religious in nature, are\n       accorded first amendment protection. A court's task is\n       to decide whether the beliefs avowed are (1) sincerely\n       held, and (2) religious in nature, in the claimant's\n       scheme of things. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S.\n       163, 185, 85 S. Ct. 850, 863, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965);\n       Callahan v. Woods, 658 F.2d 679 (9th Cir. Oct. 5,\n       1981). If either of these two requirements is not\n       satisfied, the court need not reach the question, often\n       quite difficult in the penological setting, whether a\n       legitimate and reasonably exercised state interest\n       outweighs the proffered first amendment claim.\n\nAfrica, 662 F.2d at 1029-30. It was clear that Africa's\nbeliefs were sincerely held. We concluded, however, that\nthose beliefs were not \"religious in nature\" and,\naccordingly, we had no occasion to reach the issue of\nwhether the state's legitimate interest outweighed the\nproffered free exercise claim.\n\nWhen we explained the necessity of finding a sincerely\nheld belief, we were careful in Africa to stress that the case\nlaw did not require a finding of an orthodox belief:\n\n       Judges are not oracles of theological verity, and the\n       Founders did not intend for them to be declarants of\n       religious orthodoxy. See United States v. Ballard, 322\n       U.S. 78, 85-88, 64 S. Ct. 882, 885-87, 88 L.Ed. 1148\n       (1944). The Supreme Court has emphasized, however,\n       that \"while the `truth' of a belief is not open to\n       question, there remains the significant question\n       whether it is `truly held.' \" Seeger, supra, 380 U.S. at\n       185, 85 S. Ct. at 863. Without some sort of required\n\n                               15\n\f       showing of sincerity on the part of the individual or\n       organization seeking judicial protection of its beliefs,\n       the first amendment would become \"a limitless excuse\n       for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations.\"\n\nId. at 1030 (internal footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nWe reiterated the same theme in the course of explaining\nthe necessity of a finding that Africa's sincerely held beliefs\nwere religious in nature:\n\n       As was observed earlier, the judicial branch is neither\n       authorized nor equipped to pronounce upon the veracity\n       of a religious precept. Unless, however, every\n       individual's subjective definition of a religion is to be\n       controlling in first amendment litigation, \"a court must,\n       at least to a degree, examine the content of the\n       supposed religion, not to determine its truth or falsity,\n       or whether it is schismatic or orthodox, but to determine\n       whether the subject matter it comprehends is\n       consistent with the assertion that it is, or is not, a\n       religion.\" Malnak, supra, 592 F.2d at 208 (concurring\n       opinion).\n\nId. at 1034 n.18 (emphasis added).\n\nWhile Africa was decided before Turner, there is nothing\nin Turner, subsequent Supreme Court jurisprudence, or the\njurisprudence of our circuit that is inconsistent with the\nholding in Africa. Even unorthodox beliefs are afforded\nprotection under the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment, so long as they are sincerely held and\nreligious in nature. In the present case, the defendants\nconceded that DeHart's beliefs are sincerely held and\nreligious in nature. It necessarily follows that DeHart's\nbeliefs were constitutionally protected. It also necessarily\nfollows that the District Court erred by according them less\nweight because they were not shared or considered\nessential by others in the Buddhist religion.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. By so concluding, we do not mean to suggest that evidence of the\ntenets of established religions is irrelevant in a context like this.\nQuite\nthe contrary, such evidence may bear on the determination of whether\na person's beliefs are sincerely held and whether they are religious in\nnature.\n\n                                16\n\fHaving established that DeHart's beliefs are entitled to\nconstitutional protection and that the prison is restricting\nhis ability to practice his religion in accordance with those\nbeliefs, the second prong of Turner requires us to examine\nwhether DeHart has alternative means of exercising the\ncircumscribed right. As this Court and others have noted,\nwhether an alternative means of expression remains\navailable depends on how the relevant First Amendment\nright is defined. See Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208,\n218 (3d Cir. 1999); Amatel v. Reno, 156 F.3d 192, 201 (D.C.\nCir. 1998). For this reason, the Supreme Court has\ninstructed that \" `the right' in question must be viewed\nsensibly and expansively.\" Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S.\n401, 417 (1989) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 92). In Turner,\nthe challenged prison regulation prohibited correspondence\nbetween an inmate and inmates at other institutions. The\nCourt, in applying the second factor, did not inquire\nwhether inmates had alternative means of communicating\nwith inmates at other institutions. Rather, it concluded that\nbecause the regulation barred \"communications only within\na limited class of other people,\" it did not deprive prisoners\nof alternative means of expression. Turner, 482 U.S. at 92.\nSimilarly, in Thornburgh, where the challenged regulation\nprevented inmates from receiving sexually explicit material\nthat posed a threat to security, the Court found that\nalternative means of expression were available because the\nregulations permitted \"a broad range of publications to be\nsent, received, and read.\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 418.\n\nThe distinction in Johnson on which the District Court\nseized simply recognizes that courts must consider the\nnature of the right for which the inmate seeks\naccommodation -- i.e., whether, in the context of the\ninmate's belief system, it is a \"religious commandment\" or\na \"positive expression of belief\" -- in order sensibly to\ndefine the relevant right. Thus, if failure to accommodate\nan inmate's request forces that inmate to do something that\nis proscribed by his or her religion, as he or she\nunderstands it, we must recognize that there are no\nalternative means by which he or she may engage in the\nrelevant religious practice. See Johnson, 150 F.3d at 282 (in\nsuch cases \"the importance of alternative means of religious\nobservance is an irrelevant consideration\"). The present\n\n                               17\n\fcase provides a perfect example -- by denying DeHart's\nrequest for a vegetarian diet, the prison officials forced him\nto do something forbidden by his religious beliefs. There are\nsimply no alternative means by which DeHart can maintain\na diet in conformity with his religious beliefs; he is either\nprovided a vegetarian diet, or he is not.\n\nIn contrast, where a prison regulation merely limits a\nform of positive expression of one's religious faith and\nbeliefs -- as, for example, prayer, worship, meditation,\nscripture study, etc. -- the second Turner factor requires\nconsideration of the alternative means of expression that\nare left open.7 If, as in O'Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342\n(1987), Muslim inmates are prohibited from attending\nJumu'ah, a congregate service held only on Friday\nafternoons, do they have other opportunities for congregate\nworship at other times? To the extent alternative avenues of\nexpression are open, Johnson dictates that the weight\naccorded the inmate's interest in the prohibited form of\nexpression is entitled to less weight.\n\nFollowing our reasoning in Johnson, we find that no\nalternative means of expression exist for DeHart, because\nby failing to provide him with a vegetarian diet, the prison\nofficials have forced DeHart \"to defile himself, according to\n[his own] conscience, by doing something that is completely\nforbidden by [his] religion.\" Johnson, 150 F.3d at 282\n(quoting Ward v. Walsh, 1 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 1993)).\nAs we stressed in Johnson, however, the absence of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We, thus, agree with the dissent that \"Johnson makes clear that the\ncentrality of a religious practice . . . is a valid consideration in\napplying\nthe Turner test.\" The issue for decision here, however, is whether the\nCourt in determining the \"centrality\" of a particular belief must look to\nthe sincerely held religious beliefs of the inmate involved or to the\n\"orthodox\" beliefs of others. As we have explained, we read Smith and\nAfrica together as requiring that courts not\"pronounce on the veracity\nof a religious precept.\" Africa, 662 F.2d at 1034 n.18. Provided that the\nrelevant precept is sincerely held and religious in nature, we must afford\nit constitutional protection. Thus, in this case, because the prison has\nconceded that DeHart's belief -- i.e., that his religion requires him to\nfollow a specific diet -- is sincerely held and religious in nature, that\nbelief is entitled to the full measure of constitution protection, whether\nor not it is shared by others in the Buddhist religion.\n\n                               18\n\falternatives for DeHart does not necessarily mean that his\ninterest in a vegetarian diet must be accommodated.\nNevertheless, it does mean that that interest is entitled to\nsubstantially more weight in the \"overall reasonableness\"\nanalysis than it would be if there were adequate substitute\nmeans of expression.\n\nWe recognize that our holding conflicts with the recent\ndecision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Spies v.\nVoinovich, 173 F.3d 398 (6th Cir. 1999). The facts in that\ncase were similar to those here: a prisoner desired a strict\nvegan meal -- i.e., absolutely no food stuffs derived from\nanimals -- in conformity with his Buddhist religious beliefs.\nIn Spies, however, the prisoner conceded that, while a\nvegetarian diet was required by Buddhism, a vegan diet\nwas not. The prison had provided the prisoner with a\nvegetarian diet, but it refused to provide a vegan diet. The\nprisoner brought suit, alleging infringement of his free\nexercise rights. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held\nthat, although Spies's vegan beliefs were sincerely held\nreligious beliefs, because they were not required by\nBuddhism, the prison could continue to provide a\nvegetarian meal, thereby granting Spies an \"alternative\nmeans\" of exercising his religion. See id. at 407. We,\nrespectfully, disagree with the Spies analysis.\n\nUnder the First Amendment, citizens are not limited to\npracticing an organized religion. Whether other Buddhists\nagree with DeHart's beliefs is simply not relevant to the\nTurner analysis. The analysis conducted by the District\nCourt presupposes that a person is limited to practicing a\nreligion according to a specific prescription and that only\nthose customs, which others recognize as required, will be\nunassailable. Cf. United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 87\n(1944) (\"[Man] was granted the right to worship as he\npleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his\nreligious views.\"). To us, that seems contrary to the very\npoint of the First Amendment, which was designed to\nprotect the free exercise of any religion, whether it be\norganized, accepted, or not. See Spies v. Voinovich, 173\nF.3d 398, 409 (6th Cir. 1999) (Moore, J., dissenting) (\"the\nFirst Amendment does not provide greater protection for\ncentralized religions with established sets of mandatory\n\n                               19\n\fdoctrines than it provides for less established or individual-\nbased religions\").\n\n3. Remaining Factors and the Weighing Process\n\nThe first two Turner factors focus on the prison's decision\n-- to what extent is it justified by legitimate and neutral\nconcerns and what options does it leave open to the inmate.\nThe third and fourth factors, on the other hand, focus on\nthe specific religious practice or expression in which the\ninmate wishes to engage -- what will be the consequences\nof accommodating the inmate for guards, other inmates,\nand the allocation of prison resources.\n\nAs we have previously noted, DeHart desires a meal,\nserved along with the therapeutic meals, consisting of an\neight-ounce cup of soy milk and increased portions of the\nnon-meat and non-dairy items from the master menu. The\nsoy milk supplement is the only item DeHart requests that\nis not currently purchased by the DOC. The District Court\nfound that the prison could provide DeHart a cup of the soy\nmilk at each meal for a total cost of $1.71 per day.\n\nThe District Court's analysis of the third Turner factor\nwas as follows:\n\n       The third factor in the Turner test is the impact which\n       providing plaintiff a strict vegetarian diet would have\n       on the institution, guards and other inmates. There is\n       no undisputed evidence concerning the impact this\n       factor has, and it is neutral for purposes of the motion\n       for summary judgment.\n\nDistrict Court Slip Op. at 17. With respect to the fourth\nfactor, the District Court concluded that \"the cost factor\nfavors the prison, while the fact that an available\nalternative exists favors plaintiff 's position. This factor is\nalso neutral.\" District Court Slip Op. at 18.\n\nThe District Court ultimately granted summary judgment\nagainst DeHart on the following ground:\n\n       Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to\n       plaintiff, two of the four Turner factors weigh in favor of\n       defendants, while the final two factors are neutral.\n       Thus, the court concludes that application of the\n\n                               20\n\f       Turner balancing test results in the conclusion that the\n       First Amendment does not require Prison Officials to\n       provide plaintiff a vegetarian diet.\n\nDistrict Court Slip Op. at 18.\n\nThe District Court's analysis of the third factor is\nunacceptable. It is true that there is \"no undisputed\nevidence\" regarding the impact that accommodating DeHart\nwould have on the prison community. DeHart's evidence\nregarding the service of therapeutic and kosher meals and\nwhat it would take to meet his religious requirements would\nsupport an inference that any impact would be minimal.\nOn the other hand, the defendants have tendered evidence\ntending to show that, if DeHart is accommodated, others\nwill demand similar treatment. But the fact that there is no\nundisputed evidence is not a reason for concluding that the\nthird factor is neutral. If there is conflicting evidence, the\nconflict needs to be resolved and findings made about the\nsize and quality of the impact on the prison community.\nWithout such findings, it is not possible for the District\nCourt to engage in the sensitive weighing process that\nTurner envisions.\n\nThis brings us to a final fundamental problem with the\nDistrict Court's analysis. Turner does not call for placing\neach factor in one of two columns and tallying a numerical\nresult. The objective is to determine whether the regulation\nis reasonable given the defendants' penological concerns\nand the inmate's interest in engaging in the constitutionally\nprotected activity. Turner thus contemplates a weighing\nprocess, and various factors necessarily will be entitled to\ndifferent weights depending on the circumstances. We have\nalready spoken about how the weight to be given to the\nsecond factor will vary depending on the availability of\nalternatives. The same is true of the first factor; direct\nthreats to the security of the institution will justify\ninfringements on First Amendment rights that speculative\nefficiency concerns will not. Accordingly, the Court, while\ngiving due deference to the expertise of prison officials,\nmust take into account the character of the legitimate\npenological interest advanced and the degree to which that\ninterest will be served by the challenged regulation.\n\n                                 21\n\fIV.\n\nFinally, DeHart asserts an equal protection claim,\narguing that he is similarly situated to the Jewish inmates\nin Johnson whose dietary restrictions were accommodated\nby the defendants. As with his First Amendment claim,\nDeHart's equal protection claim must be analyzed under\nthe Turner framework. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89 (\"[W]hen\na prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional\nrights, the regulation is valid it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\"). Thus, in order to recover,\nDeHart \"must prove that the distinction between himself\nand the other inmates was not reasonably related to some\nlegitimate penological purpose.\" Clark v. Groose, 36 F.3d\n770, 773 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\nAs we noted earlier, the District Court did not comment\non the fact that the defendants are currently providing\nspecially prepared kosher diets to Jewish inmates at greater\ncost. We have already rejected defendants' argument that\nDeHart may be treated differently because his diet is not\nrequired by Buddhism generally. Thus, as with the First\nAmendment claim, if DeHart can demonstrate that no\nlegitimate penological purpose is served by treating him\ndifferently from the inmates in Johnson, he must prevail on\nhis equal protection claim. Due to the absence offindings\nas to whether the prison's decision to treat DeHart\ndifferently from Jewish inmates is \"reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests,\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89,\nhowever, we will remand this issue to the District Court.\n\nV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District\nCourt will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                               22\n\fSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part.\n\nI agree with the majority that this case should be\nremanded for further factual assessment of the factors set\nforth in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987). I also\nagree with the majority's admonition that those factors are\nto be balanced, not tallied. I write separately because I\nrespectfully disagree with the majority's position as to\nwhether an analysis of an inmate's \"alternative means of\nreligious expression\" under Turner properly may include an\nassessment of the centrality of the religious tenet on which\nan inmate's requested accommodation is based.\n\nTurner requires us to uphold a prison's regulation if it is\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Once\na prison establishes a legitimate interest, the four Turner\nfactors gauge the regulation's overall reasonableness. I\nagree that the defendants here established the necessary\nlegitimate penological interest, and established that the\nprison's special diet regulation is rationally related to that\ninterest (the first Turner factor). I disagree with the\nmajority's analysis of the remaining Turner factors.\n\nThe second Turner factor assesses the existence of\nalternative means by which an inmate can practice his\nreligion, not whether there are alternatives to the specific\nactivity at issue.1 O'Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 351-52\n(1987). Here, the District Court concluded that DeHart had\nmany alternative ways to exercise his right -- meditation,\nprayer, or reading religious texts -- all of which the prison\nallowed. The District Court based its analysis of this factor\non a determination that vegetarianism is not a\n\"commandment\" of Buddhism (even of the particular sect to\nwhich DeHart belongs), but is merely a positive expression\nof DeHart's faith. The majority rejects this analysis, stating\nthat the court erred in making any assessment at all about\nthe central tenet issue, because under Employment Div.,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. For this reason, I believe the majority's conclusion that \"[t]here are\nsimply no alternative means by which DeHart can maintain a diet in\nconformity with his religious beliefs\" is based on too narrow a\ncharacterization of the \"right\" at issue.\n\n                               23\n\fDep't of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990),\nsuch inquiry is forbidden.\n\nI do not believe that Smith forbids inquiry into the central\ntenet issue when assessing Turner's second factor. Smith\naddressed whether a criminal law banning peyote use was\nunconstitutional where the use was religious. Holding that\nit was not, the Court rejected application of a\"compelling\ninterest\" test, stating that it would be improper for judges\nto assess the centrality of religious beliefs in assessing\nwhether to apply a compelling interest test. Id. at 886. The\nCourt did not indicate that the centrality issue should\nnever be considered, and did not address the centrality\nissue in the context of assessing a challenged prison\nregulation.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. For the same reason, I do not believe that Africa v. Pennsylvania, 662\nF.2d 1025 (3d Cir. 1981) concludes our inquiry here. The key issue there\nwas whether Africa's purported religion (\"MOVE\") was in fact a religion.\nWe held that it was not. As the majority acknowledges, Africa did not\nreach the issue that DeHart presents: whether the state's penological\ninterests outweigh an inmate's free exercise claim. In this case, the\nparties do not dispute that DeHart's beliefs are religious in nature, or\nsincerely held. (Interestingly, the record shows that only after DeHart\nfiled several grievances objecting to a diet that included vegetables\ncooked in butter did he raise the issue of his religious practices.) Nor\nare\nthe parties (or the court) attempting to assess the truth or falsity of\nDeHart's beliefs. Instead, as Turner requires, we assess the central tenet\nissue to determine whether DeHart has alternative ways to exercise his\nFirst Amendment rights. Similarly, in Africa we expressly acknowledged\nthat a court must examine the content of an asserted religion (at least\nto a degree) in order to determine whether it is, in fact, a religion.\nAfrica,\n662 F.2d at 1034 n.18. In short, to interpret Africa to preclude any\nobjective evidence on the centrality issue would eviscerate Turner's\nsecond prong. On this point, I note that in Johnson we analyzed the\nissue in terms of the requirements of the kosher laws, and not merely\nthe inmates' subjective interpretations of those laws. Similarly, the\ncourt\nin Ward v. Walsh, 1 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 1993) (a case we quoted in\nJohnson) stated that on remand the district court could consider the\ninmate's \"challenge to the orthodoxy of the rabbi who testified on behalf\nof the state.\" Clearly, the inquiry does not end with the inmate's claims;\nthe defendant is entitled to put on evidence of the centrality of the\npractice at issue, and the district court is entitled to weigh that\nevidence\nagainst the inmate's testimony.\n\n                               24\n\fTurner, however, did address the issue of assessing a\nchallenged prison regulation, noting expressly the deference\nto be accorded to prison officials' decisions, and the\nseparation of powers concerns that counsel a policy of\njudicial restraint. Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85. Turner\nrequires courts to consider whether an inmate has\nalternative means of exercising his right to religious\nfreedom. That question cannot be answered withoutfirst\ndetermining the centrality of the practice or belief at issue;\nthat is, whether or not it is commanded by the inmate's\nreligion. As we held in Johnson -- in the specific context of\nevaluating the second Turner factor --\"the importance of\nalternative means of religious observance is an irrelevant\nconsideration when the belief at issue is a `religious\ncommandment' rather than a positive expression of belief.\"\nJohnson, 150 F.3d at 282. The Jewish inmates in Johnson\nwould have been \" `defiling' themselves under the laws of\nkosher when forced to eat non-kosher foods . . . In such\nsituations, the centrality of the religious tenet carries\ngreater weight and the existence of alternative means of\nobservance is of no use in the ultimate balance which\nTurner commands.\" Id. at 282.\n\nIt seems to me that our holding in Johnson makes clear\nthat the centrality of a religious practice -- in particular,\nwhether it is a commandment of the religion or a positive\nexpression of belief -- is a valid consideration in applying\nthe Turner test. If the practice is a commandment (as is\nkeeping kosher for certain Jewish inmates), then alternative\nmeans of expression are irrelevant, and the second Turner\nfactor will weigh in an inmate's favor. But if the practice is\na positive expression of belief and the inmate has\nalternative means of expression, then the factor may weigh\nin the defendant's favor, depending on the facts.\n\nHere, the evidence established that vegetarianism (or, by\nextension, the more restrictive veganism that DeHart\nwishes to practice) is not a commandment of either\nBuddhism in general or of the particular branch of\nBuddhism that DeHart practices. This is shown by the\ntestimony of the defendants' expert witness, and by the\nwritten correspondence between DeHart and his spiritual\nmentors, members of The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas.\n\n                               25\n\fIn response to DeHart's query about vegetarianism, The\nCity of Ten Thousand Buddhas advised him that although\nvegetarianism is preferred, it was not mandated in his\nsituation: \"Clearly you are not in an ideal situation for\ndoing so. The Buddha, in giving us the Precepts,\nconsistently provided minor acceptions [sic] in cases where\nit would be impossible to hold them to the finest detail . . .\n[I]t would seem enough that you are sincere in your wish to\nmaintain the Buddha's precepts and that you try your very\nbest to follow the Buddha's instructions as closely as\npossible, while practicing patience with our states and with\nyour environment.\" Thus, even the particular Buddhist\ntemple to which DeHart belongs does not believe that\nDeHart's vegetarianism is a required practice, and does not\nview his failure to keep the diet as a defiling offense. For\nthis reason, the situation of the Jewish inmates in Johnson\nproperly is distinguished from that of DeHart. In this\nregard, I respectfully disagree with the majority's contrary\nposition (and instructions regarding entry of judgment on\nremand).3\n\nAs to the third and fourth Turner factors-- the impact on\nthe prison of accommodating DeHart's request for special\nmeals, and whether there are easy alternatives by which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The majority instructs the District Court to enter judgment for DeHart\nunless it can distinguish this case from Johnson on grounds other than\nthe central tenet issue. The majority's instruction is based on its\ninterpretation of Turner's requirement that in order for a regulation to\nbe\nrationally related to a legitimate penological interest, the regulation\nmust\nbe neutral. Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90. I do not believe Turner's\nneutrality\nrequirement supports the majority's directive, for it asks whether the\nchallenged regulation operates in a neutral way, without regard to the\ncontent of expression. Id. at 90. Moreover, we have previously explained\nthat Turner's neutrality requirement is met if the prison's asserted\ninterest giving rise to the regulation is unrelated to suppressing\nexpression. See Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 215 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(quoting Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 415 (1989)). We held in\nWaterman that New Jersey's interest in rehabilitating sex offenders was\nnot related to the suppression of expression, and the challenged\nregulation therefore was neutral. Id. So, too, the prison's interest here\nin\nan efficient food service system is not related to the suppression of\nreligious expression. Accordingly, its special diet regulation is neutral\nfor\npurposes of the Turner analysis.\n\n                               26\n\fDeHart can be accommodated at de minimus cost -- I agree\nthat further fact-finding is necessary. But unlike the\nmajority, I believe that on remand the court first must\nclarify the nature of DeHart's requested accommodation.\nDeHart frames the issue as a request for a vegetarian diet.\nVegetarian diets typically avoid meat, fish, and poultry.\nDeHart's proposed diet is more restrictive. Not only must it\nbe free of meat, fish, and poultry, but also free of eggs,\ndairy products, pungent root materials such as onions or\ngarlic, and any material derived from any animal product.\nIn this respect, DeHart's requested diet4 is even more\nrestrictive than a vegan diet (one disallowing all animal\nproducts) because it also would prohibit any non-animal\nfood or material that is prepared with animal products (for\nexample, vitamin supplements that may include bone\nderivatives or bread made with animal byproduct\npreservatives, both of which DeHart has declined). On this\npoint, it bears noting that the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit in Spies v. Voinovich, 173 F.3d 398 (6th Cir.\n1999) (which the majority distinguishes) held that a prison\nwas not constitutionally required to provide a Buddhist\ninmate with a vegan diet. In sum, a clear understanding of\nthe precise nature and parameters of the special diet that\nDeHart seeks (for example, whether the diet prohibit fruits\nand vegetables that have been fertilized with organic\nmaterial) is essential to a proper assessment of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The majority apparently believes that DeHart can be accommodated\nwith extra portions of vegetables and bread, and with a cup of specially-\npurchased soy milk with each meal. But, as noted supra, the record\ncontains conflicting evidence as to the precise nature of the diet that\nDeHart seeks (including a \"beans and rice\" diet that DeHart suggested at\nthe preliminary injunction hearing). Moreover, DeHart has not rebutted\nthe testimony of the defendants' expert that the\"extra portions plus soy\nmilk\" diet fails to meet the relevant regulatory nutritional requirements\nfor inmates, is based on an out-of-date master prison menu (and is\ntherefore not accurate with respect to food items that the prison has\navailable), and cannot fully be evaluated because it proposes only a five-\nday menu, compared to the prison's forty-two day menu cycle. Unless\nDeHart addresses these issues on remand, his proposed diet does not\nappear to be a viable one.\n\n                               27\n\fresulting burden on the prison in complying with his\nrequest, and the overall balancing of the Turner factors.5\n\nIn assessing the burden on the prison of accommodating\nDeHart's request, I believe the majority fails to take\nsufficient account of the evidence of the potential for \"ripple\neffect\" within the prison. The Supreme Court has\nencouraged courts to give \"particular deference\" to the\ninformed discretion of corrections officials on this issue.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90.\n\nFinally, with respect to DeHart's equal protection claim\nthat he is being treated differently from Jewish inmates\nwho request and receive kosher meals, I do not believe that\nDeHart has stated a valid claim. In order to do so, he must\ncome forward with some evidence of discriminatory intent\non the part of the defendants. DeHart has not done so.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the grant of summary judgment\non this issue.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The majority's point as to the need for a bona fide balancing of the\nfactors is well-taken. But we have noted that in the course of conducting\nthat balancing, the first Turner factor \"looms especially large.\"\nWaterman,\n183 F.3d at 208.\n\n                                28\n\f",

DeHart (\"DeHart\"), an\ninmate at the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institute\n(\"SCI\") at Greene, commenced this civil rights action\nagainst Martin Horn, Commissioner of the Department of\nCorrections of Pennsylvania, and James Price,\nSuperintendent of SCI at Greene (collectively \"the prison\" or\n\"prison officials\"), as a result of their failure to provide him\nwith a diet consistent with his Buddhist religious beliefs.\nDeHart appeals the final order of the District Court,\ngranting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. He\ninsists that the defendants' failure to accommodate his\nreligious belief, which requires him to follow a vegetarian\ndiet, violates both his right to free religious expression\nunder the First Amendment and his right to equal\nprotection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. We\nwill reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                  2\n\fI.\n\nDeHart is currently serving a life sentence at SCI at\nGreene. Since his incarceration, he, with the assistance of\nthe City of 10,000 Buddhas, a center of Buddhist teaching,\nhas taught himself Buddhism. Based on his own reading of\nthe Sutras, which are Buddhist religious texts, DeHart\nbecame a vegetarian. DeHart testified before the District\nCourt that the First Precept in Buddhism prohibits the\nkilling of any living thing, and he has interpreted that\nPrecept as requiring that he follow a vegetarian diet. The\nprison officials do not challenge the sincerity of DeHart's\nbeliefs. They do, however, challenge whether vegetarianism\nis a central tenet of any recognized Buddhist sect.\n\nA brief overview of the process by which Pennsylvania\nprisons provide meals to inmates is necessary for a proper\nunderstanding of DeHart's request. Pursuant to a master\nmenu, all inmates at SCI Greene receive the same meals.\nThe food for those meals is obtained through bulk\npurchases. Those inmates whose health requires dietary\nmodifications or restrictions receive a therapeutic diet. In\norder for an inmate to receive a therapeutic diet, however,\nit must be prescribed by an institution doctor. The\ntherapeutic diet consists of the same foods (in different\nproportions) that are served on the master menu. The\ntherapeutic meals are prepared individually, and all\ninmates who have been prescribed a therapeutic diet eat\ntogether in one dining hall after it has been cleared of the\nother inmates.\n\nDeHart proposes that he be served a vegetarian meal\nwhen other inmates are served the therapeutic meals.\nDeHart secured the affidavit of a dietician, who averred that\nDeHart's nutritional needs could be satisfied by doubling\nthe portions of vegetables and grains already served and\nthen adding an eight-ounce cup of a soy-based milk\nproduct at each meal.1 The cost of this supplement, which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. As the affidavit of DeHart's dietician notes, his proposed diet does\nnot\nmeet the Recommended Daily Allowance (\"RDA\") standards for Vitamin\nD, riboflavin, B-6, and zinc as set forth by the National Academy of\nSciences and adopted by the American Correctional Association. As she\n\n                               3\n\fis not currently purchased by the Department of\nCorrections (\"DOC\"), would be $1.71 per day.2\n\nOn June 17, 1995, DeHart submitted a written grievance,\nrequesting a diet that comports with his religious beliefs.\nThat grievance was denied, and DeHart appealed the denial\nto Superintendent Price, who concurred in the result. The\ndenial was again upheld on appeal by the DOC Central\nOffice Review Committee. DeHart then filed this suit\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983.\n\nA preliminary injunction hearing was held before a\nMagistrate Judge, who found that vegetarianism is not\nmandated by Buddhism and, for that reason, recommended\nthat DeHart be denied preliminary relief. The District Court\nadopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation. DeHart\nthen appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the denial of\npreliminary injunctive relief. See DeHart v. Horn, No. 97-\n3048 (3d Cir. Aug. 25, 1997) (hereinafter \"Memorandum\nOpinion\"). In the Memorandum Opinion affirming the\nDistrict Court's decision, this Court admonished the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nexplained, it did provide more than two-thirds of the RDA standard in\neach instance, and these deficiencies did not cause her to qualify her\nopinion that the proposed diet was sufficient to meet DeHart's\nnutritional needs. The District Court made no findings regarding the\nsignificance, if any, of these deficiencies. The Pennsylvania DOC Food\nServices Administrative Directive requires that, for the master menu, a\nregistered dietician verify that the diet \"meets or exceeds the dietary\nallowances as stated in the [RDAs] . . . .\" App. 652. For the therapeutic\ndiets, however, the regulation merely requires that the diet \"be designed\nand certified by a Registered Dietician as being nutritionally correct.\"\nApp. 656. The regulation also provides that it \"should be interpreted to\nhave sufficient flexibility so as to be consistent with law . . . .\" App.\n657.\nOn remand, the District Court may find it necessary to determine how\nthis Administrative Directive should be interpreted in a context like\nthis.\nIf it should determine that the proposed diet is inconsistent with the\nAdministrative Directive, however, the issue would remain whether\nunder Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987), the prison rules and\nregulations as a whole, as applied to this case, are reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\n\n2. The dietician indicated that a day's supply of soy-based milk product\nwould cost $1.71 if purchased in a supermarket and would cost less if\npurchased directly from a distributor.\n\n                               4\n\fDistrict Court not to interject itself into Buddhist doctrinal\ndisputes: \"We agree with [DeHart] that the district court\ncould properly determine only whether he sincerely held his\nreligious beliefs, not whether his beliefs are doctrinally\ncorrect or central to a particular school of Buddhist\nteaching.\" Memorandum Opinion at 2 (citing Employment\nDivision v.

The\nMagistrate Judge recommended that summary judgment be\ngranted in favor of the prison officials. DeHartfiled\nobjections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and\nRecommendation, arguing, inter alia, that the Magistrate\nJudge ignored this Court's instructions and again based his\nopinion on a finding that vegetarianism is not a central\ntenet of the Buddhist religion. The District Court adopted\nthe Report and Recommendation over that objection, and\nthis appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\nThe District Court had jurisdiction over this case,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1331, and this Court has\njurisdiction over the present appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court's\ndecision to grant summary judgment. See Wicker v.

Nevertheless, the fact of\nincarceration and the valid penological objectives of\ndeterrence of crime, rehabilitation of prisoners, and\ninstitutional security require certain limitations on the\nexercise of constitutional rights by inmates. See Pell v.\nProcunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109079\"><a href=\"/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822-23 (1974).\n\nIn Turner v.

The\"second . . . is the\nrecognition that `courts are ill equipped to deal with the\nincreasingly urgent problems of prison administration' and\n[that] separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of\njudicial restraint.\" Id. at 84-85 (quoting Procunier v.\nMartinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109016\"><a href=\"/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1974)). Thus, while this\nstandard of review requires a court to respect the security,\nrehabilitation and administrative concerns underlying a\nprison regulation, without requiring proof that the\nregulation is the least restrictive means of addressing those\nconcerns, it also requires a court to give weight, in\nassessing the overall reasonableness of regulations, to the\ninmate's interest in engaging in constitutionally protected\nactivity.\n\nTurner goes on to provide guidance on how to apply its\nreasonableness standard. As we recently explained in\nWaterman v. Farmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765101\"><a href=\"/opinion/765101/richard-waterman-michael-curtis-v-john-farmer-jr-new-jersey-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(internal citations omitted):\n\n                               6\n\f       [Turner] directs courts to assess the overall\n       reasonableness of such regulations by weighing four\n       factors. \"First, there must be a `valid, rational\n       connection' between the prison regulation and the\n       legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify\n       it,\" and this connection must not be \"so remote as to\n       render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\" Second, a\n       court must consider whether inmates retain alternative\n       means of exercising the circumscribed right. Third, a\n       court must take into account the costs that\n       accommodating the right would impose on other\n       inmates, guards, and prison resources generally. And\n       fourth, a court must consider whether there are\n       alternatives to the regulation that \"fully accommodate[ ]\n       the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid\n       penological interests.\"\n\n1. Rational Connection to Penological Interests\n\nThe prison asserts that two penological interests are\nserved by denying DeHart's request for a vegetarian diet: (1)\nthe interest in a simplified and efficient food service; and (2)\nthe interest in avoiding possible resentment and jealousy\non the part of other inmates. The District Court found that\nthe denial of DeHart's religious diet was rationally related to\nthose two legitimate, penological goals. Given the deference\nwe must show to the reasoned judgment of prison officials\nand our recent decision in Johnson v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756449\"><a href=\"/opinion/756449/jeffrey-e-johnson-bruce-howard-shore-in-no-97-3581-v-martin-f-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(3d Cir. 1998), we agree.\n\nIn Johnson, two Pennsylvania prison inmates sued prison\nofficials, alleging a violation of their free exercise rights. The\ninmates were Jewish and were seeking a kosher diet in\nconformity with their religious beliefs. In that case,\nhowever, the prison officials conceded that the inmates\nwere entitled to receive a kosher diet; the only issue was\nwhether that diet had to consist of hot or cold meals. See\nid. at 281. This Court, thus, never addressed the\nfundamental issue in this case -- i.e., whether the prison is\nconstitutionally required to serve a diet that conforms with\nDeHart's religious beliefs. Nevertheless, the Court's analysis\nis helpful here.\n\nIn Johnson, the Court specifically held that \"[t]he Prison\nhas a legitimate penological interest in keeping its food\n\n                                7\n\fservice system as simple as possible.\" Id. at 282; see also\nWard v.

We further observed that the inmates' \"request for\na [religious diet] creates legitimate security concerns,\nincluding bringing additional foods from new sources into\nthe Prison and the possible belief by other inmates that\n[plaintiffs] are receiving special treatment.\" Johnson, 150\nF.3d at 282.\n\nJohnson, thus, forecloses any argument as to the\nlegitimacy of a prison's interest in an efficient food system\nor in avoiding inmate jealousy; those interests are\nlegitimate penological concerns under Turner. Moreover, we\nagree that the prison's refusal to grant DeHart's request for\na religious diet bears some rational relation to those\nconcerns. The fifty-five therapeutic trays prepared at each\nmeal complicates the food service regimen of the prison,\nand preparation of additional special meals would add\nincrementally to the burden. Similarly, while the evidence\nindicates that the provision of therapeutic meals has never\ngiven rise to problems in the past, it is not irrational to\nthink that providing DeHart with a vegetarian diet to\naccommodate his religious beliefs might involve some risk\nof inmate jealousy.\n\nThis determination commences rather than concludes\nour inquiry for two reasons. First, while a rational nexus\nbetween a regulation and a legitimate penological interest is\nessential to its validity, see Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90, not\nall prison regulations that are rationally related to such an\ninterest pass Turner's \"overall reasonableness\" standard.\nTurner, thus, calls for more than traditional rational basis\nreview. As the remaining factors evidence, the Turner\nstandard also takes into account the extent of the burden\nimposed by the regulation on an inmate's religious\nexpression, as well as the impact that accommodating the\ninmate's constitutional claim would have on the entire\nprison community and its resources.\n\nSecond, Turner teaches that the \"governmental objective\nmust be [both] a legitimate and neutral one.\" Id. at 90\n(emphasis added). The Court \"found it important to inquire\nwhether prison regulations restricting inmates' First\n\n                                8\n\fAmendment rights operated in a neutral fashion, without\nregard to the content of the expression.\" Id. DeHart brought\nto the District Court's attention the fact that the defendants\nin Johnson had urged a judge and a magistrate judge of the\nsame court not to order them to provide kosher meals to\nJewish inmates because the prison was voluntarily\nproviding such a diet. DeHart further pointed out that the\nkosher diet being voluntarily provided consisted of milk,\nuncut fruit and vegetables, and a nutritional supplement,\nand that the cost to the prison for these kosher meals was\nsubstantially more than the cost of the liquid supplement\ndiet he was requesting.3 The defendants comment on these\nfacts only in response to DeHart's Equal Protection\nargument. Their sole response is: \"In Johnson, the Court\nwas presented with kosher laws that are a commandment\nof the Orthodox Jewish faith. . . . Here, vegetarianism while\nan expression of belief, is not a commandment of\nBuddhism.\" Appellees' Br. at 29.\n\nWhile the District Court did not comment on the fact that\nthe defendants were providing specially prepared kosher\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. DeHart also called to the Court's attention the following observations\nof the District Court during the initial stage of the Johnson case:\n\n        The facts as to which there is no genuine dispute may be\n        summarized as follows: 1) keeping kosher is a religious obligation\n        central to the practice of Orthodox Jews, including plaintiffs; 2)\n        although there are increased dollar costs associated with\n        accommodating a kosher diet, those costs are not significant in\nlight\n        of the nature of the diet which plaintiffs testified they could eat\nand\n       remain kosher in accordance with the advice of their religious\n       leaders; 3) there are no realistic grounds for believing that\n       accommodating the plaintiffs' kosher diet will have any impact on\n       the defendants' legitimate goals of maintaining institutional order\n       and safety, and the marginal administrative costs of separating\n       genuine from false claims that a prisoner is an Orthodox Jew who\n       is required to keep kosher, in light of the administrative\napparatus\n       already in place in the Department of Corrections, is minimal.\n\n       I conclude that there is a constitutional right for these\nplaintiffs as\n       Orthodox Jews to keep kosher as described in the evidentiary record\n       of this case, i.e., to a kosher diet not requiring the\nestablishment of\n       a separate kitchen or segregated handling procedures.\n\nApp. at 152.\n\f9\n\fmeals with nutritional supplements to the Jewish inmates\nat greater cost, we assume that it must have accepted the\ndistinction tendered by the defense. As we explain\nhereafter, the proffered distinction is untenable. If, on\nremand, the District Court can articulate no other reason\nwhy DeHart and the Jewish inmates are not similarly\nsituated, it must enter judgment for DeHart. As we have\nnoted, neutrality in the regulation of religious expression is\na sine qua non of validity under Turner.4\n\n2. Alternative Means of Religious Expression\n\nThis factor requires a court to focus on the burden that\nthe regulation imposes on an inmate's ability to engage in\nconstitutionally protected activity. Turner instructs that\nwhere \" `other avenues' remain available for the exercise of\nthe asserted right, . . . courts should be particularly\nconscious of the `measure of judicial deference owed to\ncorrections officials . . . in gauging the validity of the\nregulation.' \" Turner, 482 U.S. at 90 (quoting Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. at 827). Conversely, where the\nregulation leaves no alternative means of exercising the\nasserted right, the inmate's interest in engaging in the\nprohibited activity is entitled to greater weight in the\nbalancing process.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. We agree with the dissent that a court must examine whether the\ninterest asserted as a justification for the regulation is \"unrelated to\nthe\nsuppression of expression.\" Waterman v. Farmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765101\"><a href=\"/opinion/765101/richard-waterman-michael-curtis-v-john-farmer-jr-new-jersey-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (3d\nCir. 1999) (quoting Thornburgh v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (1989)). The\ninquiry cannot stop there, however. As we have pointed out above,\nimmediately after setting forth the \"neutrality\" requirement, the Turner\nCourt stressed that it was \"important to inquire whether prison\nregulations restricting inmates' First Amendment rights operated in a\nneutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression.\" Turner,\n482 U.S. at 90 (emphasis added); see also Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 420\n(finding regulations facially valid under the Turner standard, but\nremanding \"for an examination of the validity of the regulations as\napplied\"). The fundamental inquiry under Turner is whether what the\nprison is doing is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\nand we are confident that the Court did not mean to suggest that such\na relationship can exist where a prison, without substantial justification\nrelated to legitimate, penological interests, chooses to accommodate the\nreligious dietary needs of Jewish inmates while refusing to accommodate\nan inmate of another faith.\n\n                               10\n\fIn Johnson, we applied this teaching in the context of an\nasserted right to a diet in conformity with one's religious\nbeliefs. There we contrasted situations involving alternative\nmeans of religious expression with situations involving\nreligious commandments that the prison regulation\nrequires the inmate to violate. We explained:\n\n       [T]he importance of alternative means of religious\n       observance is an irrelevant consideration when the\n       belief at issue is a \"religious commandment,\" rather\n       than a \"positive expression of belief.\" [ Ward v. Walsh,\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627445\"><a href=\"/opinion/627445/jason-mckinley-ward-v-jessie-walsh-associate-warden-of-programs/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878 (9th Cir. 1993)] (discussing Jewish\n       kosher laws). As the United States Court of Appeals for\n       the Ninth Circuit has stated: \"It is one thing to curtail\n       various ways of expressing belief, for which alternative\n       ways of expressing belief may be found. It is another\n       thing to require a believer to defile himself, according\n       to the believer's conscience, by doing something that is\n       completely forbidden by the believer's religion.\" Id. As\n       in Ward, the Inmates here are \"defiling\" themselves\n       under the laws of kosher when forced to eat non-\n       kosher foods. By acknowledging this, we do not intend\n       to suggest that all \"religious commandments\" must be\n       accommodated, whatever their costs to legitimate\n       penological concerns. However, in such situations the\n       centrality of the religious tenet carries greater weight\n       and the existence of alternative means of observance is\n       of no use in the ultimate balancing which Turner\n       commands.\n\nJohnson, 150 F.3d at 282.\n\nThe District Court erroneously interpreted the distinction\nwe drew in Johnson as calling for an assessment of whether\nvegetarianism was a \"central tenet\" of Buddhism or some\nrecognized sect thereof. In the course of its analysis, the\nCourt relied heavily on the testimony of Richard McKinney,\nan expert in the doctrine and practices of Buddhism, at the\npreliminary injunction hearing. Based on that testimony, it\nmade the following findings:\n\n       Plaintiff practices Mahayana Buddhism, which is one\n       of three major traditions of Buddhist practice, along\n       with the Hinayana and Vajrayana traditions. . . . He\n\n                               11\n\f       has obtained information from the City of Ten\n       Thousand Buddhists in this respect. Mr. McKinney\n       spoke to two members of the Board of Directors for the\n       City of Ten Thousand Buddhas immediately prior to\n       the hearing in this matter, and they informed him that\n       vegetarianism is a \"branch, not a root of their\n       particular approach to Buddhism.\"[5]\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Mr. McKinney gave the following explanation of the \"branch, not root\"\nconcept:\n\n        Q. What do you mean by that?\n\n        A. By that I mean that it is not a root practice, it is a -- like a\n        branch on a tree, it is a -- a practice that one can engage in.\nThey\n        happen to engage in that practice.\n\n        Q. Who are they?\n\n        A. Both the monk and the nun that I was talking about.\n\n        Q. Are they within the City of Ten Thousand Buddhists?\n\n        A. They're part of the organization.\n\n        * * *\n\n        Q. With the experience that you have, do you consider the strict\n        vegetarian practice as it is practiced within the City of Ten\n        Thousand Buddhas to be a high form of practice within Buddhism?\n\n        A. I'm hesitating because the idea of higher or lower practice, in\n        which I just said, is -- the root practices have to do with the\n        precepts. The vegetarianism is not higher, it is just a practice\nwhich\n        grows out of the precept of not harming.\n\n        Q. Okay. Is vegetarianism mandated by Buddhism?\n\n        A. No.\n\nApp. at 104-05.\n\nOn cross-examination, Mr. McKinney further testified:\n\n        Q. Do some Buddhists practice vegetarianism as a matter of\n        religious belief or conviction?\n\n        A. Yes.\n\fQ. Okay. And, in fact, isn't it the case that the-- that the monks\nor some people associated with the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas\npractice vegetarianism?\n\n                        12\n\f       While supporting plaintiff 's right to pursue Buddhism\n       as plaintiff understands it, Mr. McKinney stated that\n       no one practice is an absolute necessity for Buddhism,\n       and that one should \"practice what one is able to\n       practice within the environment and conditions that\n       one can.\" Mr. McKinney also opined that sutras are\n       guidelines, and that plaintiff is interpreting them\"in a\n       very literalistic manner.\"\n\n       What the court is faced with, then, is a situation where\n       plaintiff may sincerely believe that he would defile\n       himself by not following the strict vegetarian diet he\n       has described. His belief, however, is clearly not shared\n       by any other Buddhist identified to the court, and is\n       specifically rejected as a \"central\" tenet by the very sect\n       of Buddhists to which plaintiff has appealed for\n       guidance in the past.\n\n       * * *\n\n       Since vegetarianism is neither a central part of\n       Buddhism, nor a commandment of that religion,\n       plaintiff 's wish to pursue vegetarianism must be\n       considered an expression of his faith as opposed to his\n       adherence to a religious commandment. This being the\n       case, the existence of alternative means of expression,\n       including prayer and possession of religious texts,\n       makes this factor one which weighs in the prison's\n       favor as well.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. And isn't it the case that at least some of the people in the\nCity\n       of Ten Thousand Buddhas perform the custom where they eat one\n       vegetarian meal before noon or early in the day and that's the only\n       meal that they eat?\n\n       A. There are many Teravadan monks who do the same.\n\n       Q. Okay. And that's a function of their religious conviction and\n       religious belief, is that correct?\n\n       A. It's a function of their religious practice.\n\nApp. at 106-07.\n\n                               13\n\fDistrict Court Slip Op. at 16, 17 (internal citations omitted).\n\nThe District Court's reliance on the fact that DeHart's\nbeliefs are not shared by others in the Buddhist religion is\ninconsistent with both Supreme Court caselaw and the\nprecedent of this Court. As the Supreme Court cautioned in\nEmployment Division v. Smith:\n\n       \"[I]t is not within the judicial ken to question the\n       centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or\n       the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of\n       those creeds.\" Hernandez v.

The Supreme Court has emphasized, however,\n       that \"while the `truth' of a belief is not open to\n       question, there remains the significant question\n       whether it is `truly held.' \" Seeger, supra, 380 U.S. at\n       185, 85 S.

Without some sort of required\n\n                               15\n\f       showing of sincerity on the part of the individual or\n       organization seeking judicial protection of its beliefs,\n       the first amendment would become \"a limitless excuse\n       for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations.\"\n\nId. at 1030 (internal footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nWe reiterated the same theme in the course of explaining\nthe necessity of a finding that Africa's sincerely held beliefs\nwere religious in nature:\n\n       As was observed earlier, the judicial branch is neither\n       authorized nor equipped to pronounce upon the veracity\n       of a religious precept. Unless, however, every\n       individual's subjective definition of a religion is to be\n       controlling in first amendment litigation, \"a court must,\n       at least to a degree, examine the content of the\n       supposed religion, not to determine its truth or falsity,\n       or whether it is schismatic or orthodox, but to determine\n       whether the subject matter it comprehends is\n       consistent with the assertion that it is, or is not, a\n       religion.\" Malnak, supra, 592 F.2d at 208 (concurring\n       opinion).\n\nId. at 1034 n.18 (emphasis added).\n\nWhile Africa was decided before Turner, there is nothing\nin Turner, subsequent Supreme Court jurisprudence, or the\njurisprudence of our circuit that is inconsistent with the\nholding in Africa. Even unorthodox beliefs are afforded\nprotection under the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment, so long as they are sincerely held and\nreligious in nature. In the present case, the defendants\nconceded that DeHart's beliefs are sincerely held and\nreligious in nature. It necessarily follows that DeHart's\nbeliefs were constitutionally protected. It also necessarily\nfollows that the District Court erred by according them less\nweight because they were not shared or considered\nessential by others in the Buddhist religion.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. By so concluding, we do not mean to suggest that evidence of the\ntenets of established religions is irrelevant in a context like this.\nQuite\nthe contrary, such evidence may bear on the determination of whether\na person's beliefs are sincerely held and whether they are religious in\nnature.\n\n                                16\n\fHaving established that DeHart's beliefs are entitled to\nconstitutional protection and that the prison is restricting\nhis ability to practice his religion in accordance with those\nbeliefs, the second prong of Turner requires us to examine\nwhether DeHart has alternative means of exercising the\ncircumscribed right. As this Court and others have noted,\nwhether an alternative means of expression remains\navailable depends on how the relevant First Amendment\nright is defined. See Waterman v. Farmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765101\"><a href=\"/opinion/765101/richard-waterman-michael-curtis-v-john-farmer-jr-new-jersey-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n218 (3d Cir. 1999); Amatel v.

For this reason, the Supreme Court has\ninstructed that \" `the right' in question must be viewed\nsensibly and expansively.\" Thornburgh v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417 (1989) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 92). In Turner,\nthe challenged prison regulation prohibited correspondence\nbetween an inmate and inmates at other institutions. The\nCourt, in applying the second factor, did not inquire\nwhether inmates had alternative means of communicating\nwith inmates at other institutions. Rather, it concluded that\nbecause the regulation barred \"communications only within\na limited class of other people,\" it did not deprive prisoners\nof alternative means of expression. Turner, 482 U.S. at 92.\nSimilarly, in Thornburgh, where the challenged regulation\nprevented inmates from receiving sexually explicit material\nthat posed a threat to security, the Court found that\nalternative means of expression were available because the\nregulations permitted \"a broad range of publications to be\nsent, received, and read.\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 418.\n\nThe distinction in Johnson on which the District Court\nseized simply recognizes that courts must consider the\nnature of the right for which the inmate seeks\naccommodation -- i.e., whether, in the context of the\ninmate's belief system, it is a \"religious commandment\" or\na \"positive expression of belief\" -- in order sensibly to\ndefine the relevant right. Thus, if failure to accommodate\nan inmate's request forces that inmate to do something that\nis proscribed by his or her religion, as he or she\nunderstands it, we must recognize that there are no\nalternative means by which he or she may engage in the\nrelevant religious practice. See Johnson, 150 F.3d at 282 (in\nsuch cases \"the importance of alternative means of religious\nobservance is an irrelevant consideration\"). The present\n\n                               17\n\fcase provides a perfect example -- by denying DeHart's\nrequest for a vegetarian diet, the prison officials forced him\nto do something forbidden by his religious beliefs. There are\nsimply no alternative means by which DeHart can maintain\na diet in conformity with his religious beliefs; he is either\nprovided a vegetarian diet, or he is not.\n\nIn contrast, where a prison regulation merely limits a\nform of positive expression of one's religious faith and\nbeliefs -- as, for example, prayer, worship, meditation,\nscripture study, etc. -- the second Turner factor requires\nconsideration of the alternative means of expression that\nare left open.7 If, as in O'Lone v. Shabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1987), Muslim inmates are prohibited from attending\nJumu'ah, a congregate service held only on Friday\nafternoons, do they have other opportunities for congregate\nworship at other times? To the extent alternative avenues of\nexpression are open, Johnson dictates that the weight\naccorded the inmate's interest in the prohibited form of\nexpression is entitled to less weight.\n\nFollowing our reasoning in Johnson, we find that no\nalternative means of expression exist for DeHart, because\nby failing to provide him with a vegetarian diet, the prison\nofficials have forced DeHart \"to defile himself, according to\n[his own] conscience, by doing something that is completely\nforbidden by [his] religion.\" Johnson, 150 F.3d at 282\n(quoting Ward v. Walsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627445\"><a href=\"/opinion/627445/jason-mckinley-ward-v-jessie-walsh-associate-warden-of-programs/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878 (9th Cir. 1993)).\nAs we stressed in Johnson, however, the absence of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We, thus, agree with the dissent that \"Johnson makes clear that the\ncentrality of a religious practice . . . is a valid consideration in\napplying\nthe Turner test.\" The issue for decision here, however, is whether the\nCourt in determining the \"centrality\" of a particular belief must look to\nthe sincerely held religious beliefs of the inmate involved or to the\n\"orthodox\" beliefs of others. As we have explained, we read Smith and\nAfrica together as requiring that courts not\"pronounce on the veracity\nof a religious precept.\" Africa, 662 F.2d at 1034 n.18. Provided that the\nrelevant precept is sincerely held and religious in nature, we must afford\nit constitutional protection. Thus, in this case, because the prison has\nconceded that DeHart's belief -- i.e., that his religion requires him to\nfollow a specific diet -- is sincerely held and religious in nature, that\nbelief is entitled to the full measure of constitution protection, whether\nor not it is shared by others in the Buddhist religion.\n\n                               18\n\falternatives for DeHart does not necessarily mean that his\ninterest in a vegetarian diet must be accommodated.\nNevertheless, it does mean that that interest is entitled to\nsubstantially more weight in the \"overall reasonableness\"\nanalysis than it would be if there were adequate substitute\nmeans of expression.\n\nWe recognize that our holding conflicts with the recent\ndecision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Spies v.\nVoinovich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763122\"><a href=\"/opinion/763122/douglas-spies-v-george-v-voinovich/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1999). The facts in that\ncase were similar to those here: a prisoner desired a strict\nvegan meal -- i.e., absolutely no food stuffs derived from\nanimals -- in conformity with his Buddhist religious beliefs.\nIn Spies, however, the prisoner conceded that, while a\nvegetarian diet was required by Buddhism, a vegan diet\nwas not. The prison had provided the prisoner with a\nvegetarian diet, but it refused to provide a vegan diet. The\nprisoner brought suit, alleging infringement of his free\nexercise rights. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held\nthat, although Spies's vegan beliefs were sincerely held\nreligious beliefs, because they were not required by\nBuddhism, the prison could continue to provide a\nvegetarian meal, thereby granting Spies an \"alternative\nmeans\" of exercising his religion. See id. at 407. We,\nrespectfully, disagree with the Spies analysis.\n\nUnder the First Amendment, citizens are not limited to\npracticing an organized religion. Whether other Buddhists\nagree with DeHart's beliefs is simply not relevant to the\nTurner analysis. The analysis conducted by the District\nCourt presupposes that a person is limited to practicing a\nreligion according to a specific prescription and that only\nthose customs, which others recognize as required, will be\nunassailable. Cf. United States v. Ballard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103976\"><a href=\"/opinion/103976/united-states-v-ballard/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87\n(1944) (\"[Man] was granted the right to worship as he\npleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his\nreligious views.\"). To us, that seems contrary to the very\npoint of the First Amendment, which was designed to\nprotect the free exercise of any religion, whether it be\norganized, accepted, or not. See Spies v. Voinovich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763122\"><a href=\"/opinion/763122/douglas-spies-v-george-v-voinovich/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (6th Cir. 1999) (Moore, J., dissenting) (\"the\nFirst Amendment does not provide greater protection for\ncentralized religions with established sets of mandatory\n\n                               19\n\fdoctrines than it provides for less established or individual-\nbased religions\").\n\n3. Remaining Factors and the Weighing Process\n\nThe first two Turner factors focus on the prison's decision\n-- to what extent is it justified by legitimate and neutral\nconcerns and what options does it leave open to the inmate.\nThe third and fourth factors, on the other hand, focus on\nthe specific religious practice or expression in which the\ninmate wishes to engage -- what will be the consequences\nof accommodating the inmate for guards, other inmates,\nand the allocation of prison resources.\n\nAs we have previously noted, DeHart desires a meal,\nserved along with the therapeutic meals, consisting of an\neight-ounce cup of soy milk and increased portions of the\nnon-meat and non-dairy items from the master menu. The\nsoy milk supplement is the only item DeHart requests that\nis not currently purchased by the DOC. The District Court\nfound that the prison could provide DeHart a cup of the soy\nmilk at each meal for a total cost of $1.71 per day.\n\nThe District Court's analysis of the third Turner factor\nwas as follows:\n\n       The third factor in the Turner test is the impact which\n       providing plaintiff a strict vegetarian diet would have\n       on the institution, guards and other inmates. There is\n       no undisputed evidence concerning the impact this\n       factor has, and it is neutral for purposes of the motion\n       for summary judgment.\n\nDistrict Court Slip Op. at 17. With respect to the fourth\nfactor, the District Court concluded that \"the cost factor\nfavors the prison, while the fact that an available\nalternative exists favors plaintiff 's position. This factor is\nalso neutral.\" District Court Slip Op. at 18.\n\nThe District Court ultimately granted summary judgment\nagainst DeHart on the following ground:\n\n       Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to\n       plaintiff, two of the four Turner factors weigh in favor of\n       defendants, while the final two factors are neutral.\n       Thus, the court concludes that application of the\n\n                               20\n\f       Turner balancing test results in the conclusion that the\n       First Amendment does not require Prison Officials to\n       provide plaintiff a vegetarian diet.\n\nDistrict Court Slip Op. at 18.\n\nThe District Court's analysis of the third factor is\nunacceptable. It is true that there is \"no undisputed\nevidence\" regarding the impact that accommodating DeHart\nwould have on the prison community. DeHart's evidence\nregarding the service of therapeutic and kosher meals and\nwhat it would take to meet his religious requirements would\nsupport an inference that any impact would be minimal.\nOn the other hand, the defendants have tendered evidence\ntending to show that, if DeHart is accommodated, others\nwill demand similar treatment. But the fact that there is no\nundisputed evidence is not a reason for concluding that the\nthird factor is neutral. If there is conflicting evidence, the\nconflict needs to be resolved and findings made about the\nsize and quality of the impact on the prison community.\nWithout such findings, it is not possible for the District\nCourt to engage in the sensitive weighing process that\nTurner envisions.\n\nThis brings us to a final fundamental problem with the\nDistrict Court's analysis. Turner does not call for placing\neach factor in one of two columns and tallying a numerical\nresult. The objective is to determine whether the regulation\nis reasonable given the defendants' penological concerns\nand the inmate's interest in engaging in the constitutionally\nprotected activity. Turner thus contemplates a weighing\nprocess, and various factors necessarily will be entitled to\ndifferent weights depending on the circumstances. We have\nalready spoken about how the weight to be given to the\nsecond factor will vary depending on the availability of\nalternatives. The same is true of the first factor; direct\nthreats to the security of the institution will justify\ninfringements on First Amendment rights that speculative\nefficiency concerns will not. Accordingly, the Court, while\ngiving due deference to the expertise of prison officials,\nmust take into account the character of the legitimate\npenological interest advanced and the degree to which that\ninterest will be served by the challenged regulation.\n\n                                 21\n\fIV.\n\nFinally, DeHart asserts an equal protection claim,\narguing that he is similarly situated to the Jewish inmates\nin Johnson whose dietary restrictions were accommodated\nby the defendants. As with his First Amendment claim,\nDeHart's equal protection claim must be analyzed under\nthe Turner framework. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89 (\"[W]hen\na prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional\nrights, the regulation is valid it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\"). Thus, in order to recover,\nDeHart \"must prove that the distinction between himself\nand the other inmates was not reasonably related to some\nlegitimate penological purpose.\" Clark v. Groose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678876\"><a href=\"/opinion/678876/vance-roy-clark-v-michael-groose-george-adams-gerald-bommell-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\nAs we noted earlier, the District Court did not comment\non the fact that the defendants are currently providing\nspecially prepared kosher diets to Jewish inmates at greater\ncost. We have already rejected defendants' argument that\nDeHart may be treated differently because his diet is not\nrequired by Buddhism generally. Thus, as with the First\nAmendment claim, if DeHart can demonstrate that no\nlegitimate penological purpose is served by treating him\ndifferently from the inmates in Johnson, he must prevail on\nhis equal protection claim. Due to the absence offindings\nas to whether the prison's decision to treat DeHart\ndifferently from Jewish inmates is \"reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests,\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89,\nhowever, we will remand this issue to the District Court.\n\nV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District\nCourt will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                               22\n\fSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part.\n\nI agree with the majority that this case should be\nremanded for further factual assessment of the factors set\nforth in Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987). I also\nagree with the majority's admonition that those factors are\nto be balanced, not tallied. I write separately because I\nrespectfully disagree with the majority's position as to\nwhether an analysis of an inmate's \"alternative means of\nreligious expression\" under Turner properly may include an\nassessment of the centrality of the religious tenet on which\nan inmate's requested accommodation is based.\n\nTurner requires us to uphold a prison's regulation if it is\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Once\na prison establishes a legitimate interest, the four Turner\nfactors gauge the regulation's overall reasonableness. I\nagree that the defendants here established the necessary\nlegitimate penological interest, and established that the\nprison's special diet regulation is rationally related to that\ninterest (the first Turner factor). I disagree with the\nmajority's analysis of the remaining Turner factors.\n\nThe second Turner factor assesses the existence of\nalternative means by which an inmate can practice his\nreligion, not whether there are alternatives to the specific\nactivity at issue.1 O'Lone v. Shabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351-52\n(1987). Here, the District Court concluded that DeHart had\nmany alternative ways to exercise his right -- meditation,\nprayer, or reading religious texts -- all of which the prison\nallowed. The District Court based its analysis of this factor\non a determination that vegetarianism is not a\n\"commandment\" of Buddhism (even of the particular sect to\nwhich DeHart belongs), but is merely a positive expression\nof DeHart's faith. The majority rejects this analysis, stating\nthat the court erred in making any assessment at all about\nthe central tenet issue, because under Employment Div.,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. For this reason, I believe the majority's conclusion that \"[t]here are\nsimply no alternative means by which DeHart can maintain a diet in\nconformity with his religious beliefs\" is based on too narrow a\ncharacterization of the \"right\" at issue.\n\n                               23\n\fDep't of Human Resources v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990),\nsuch inquiry is forbidden.\n\nI do not believe that Smith forbids inquiry into the central\ntenet issue when assessing Turner's second factor. Smith\naddressed whether a criminal law banning peyote use was\nunconstitutional where the use was religious. Holding that\nit was not, the Court rejected application of a\"compelling\ninterest\" test, stating that it would be improper for judges\nto assess the centrality of religious beliefs in assessing\nwhether to apply a compelling interest test. Id. at 886. The\nCourt did not indicate that the centrality issue should\nnever be considered, and did not address the centrality\nissue in the context of assessing a challenged prison\nregulation.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. For the same reason, I do not believe that Africa v. Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396313\"><a href=\"/opinion/396313/frank-africa-v-the-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-leroy-s-zimmerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1981) concludes our inquiry here. The key issue there\nwas whether Africa's purported religion (\"MOVE\") was in fact a religion.\nWe held that it was not. As the majority acknowledges, Africa did not\nreach the issue that DeHart presents: whether the state's penological\ninterests outweigh an inmate's free exercise claim. In this case, the\nparties do not dispute that DeHart's beliefs are religious in nature, or\nsincerely held. (Interestingly, the record shows that only after DeHart\nfiled several grievances objecting to a diet that included vegetables\ncooked in butter did he raise the issue of his religious practices.) Nor\nare\nthe parties (or the court) attempting to assess the truth or falsity of\nDeHart's beliefs. Instead, as Turner requires, we assess the central tenet\nissue to determine whether DeHart has alternative ways to exercise his\nFirst Amendment rights. Similarly, in Africa we expressly acknowledged\nthat a court must examine the content of an asserted religion (at least\nto a degree) in order to determine whether it is, in fact, a religion.\nAfrica,\n662 F.2d at 1034 n.18. In short, to interpret Africa to preclude any\nobjective evidence on the centrality issue would eviscerate Turner's\nsecond prong. On this point, I note that in Johnson we analyzed the\nissue in terms of the requirements of the kosher laws, and not merely\nthe inmates' subjective interpretations of those laws. Similarly, the\ncourt\nin Ward v. Walsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627445\"><a href=\"/opinion/627445/jason-mckinley-ward-v-jessie-walsh-associate-warden-of-programs/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878 (9th Cir. 1993) (a case we quoted in\nJohnson) stated that on remand the district court could consider the\ninmate's \"challenge to the orthodoxy of the rabbi who testified on behalf\nof the state.\" Clearly, the inquiry does not end with the inmate's claims;\nthe defendant is entitled to put on evidence of the centrality of the\npractice at issue, and the district court is entitled to weigh that\nevidence\nagainst the inmate's testimony.\n\n                               24\n\fTurner, however, did address the issue of assessing a\nchallenged prison regulation, noting expressly the deference\nto be accorded to prison officials' decisions, and the\nseparation of powers concerns that counsel a policy of\njudicial restraint. Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85. Turner\nrequires courts to consider whether an inmate has\nalternative means of exercising his right to religious\nfreedom. That question cannot be answered withoutfirst\ndetermining the centrality of the practice or belief at issue;\nthat is, whether or not it is commanded by the inmate's\nreligion. As we held in Johnson -- in the specific context of\nevaluating the second Turner factor --\"the importance of\nalternative means of religious observance is an irrelevant\nconsideration when the belief at issue is a `religious\ncommandment' rather than a positive expression of belief.\"\nJohnson, 150 F.3d at 282. The Jewish inmates in Johnson\nwould have been \" `defiling' themselves under the laws of\nkosher when forced to eat non-kosher foods . . . In such\nsituations, the centrality of the religious tenet carries\ngreater weight and the existence of alternative means of\nobservance is of no use in the ultimate balance which\nTurner commands.\" Id. at 282.\n\nIt seems to me that our holding in Johnson makes clear\nthat the centrality of a religious practice -- in particular,\nwhether it is a commandment of the religion or a positive\nexpression of belief -- is a valid consideration in applying\nthe Turner test. If the practice is a commandment (as is\nkeeping kosher for certain Jewish inmates), then alternative\nmeans of expression are irrelevant, and the second Turner\nfactor will weigh in an inmate's favor. But if the practice is\na positive expression of belief and the inmate has\nalternative means of expression, then the factor may weigh\nin the defendant's favor, depending on the facts.\n\nHere, the evidence established that vegetarianism (or, by\nextension, the more restrictive veganism that DeHart\nwishes to practice) is not a commandment of either\nBuddhism in general or of the particular branch of\nBuddhism that DeHart practices. This is shown by the\ntestimony of the defendants' expert witness, and by the\nwritten correspondence between DeHart and his spiritual\nmentors, members of The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas.\n\n                               25\n\fIn response to DeHart's query about vegetarianism, The\nCity of Ten Thousand Buddhas advised him that although\nvegetarianism is preferred, it was not mandated in his\nsituation: \"Clearly you are not in an ideal situation for\ndoing so.

For\nthis reason, the situation of the Jewish inmates in Johnson\nproperly is distinguished from that of DeHart. In this\nregard, I respectfully disagree with the majority's contrary\nposition (and instructions regarding entry of judgment on\nremand).3\n\nAs to the third and fourth Turner factors-- the impact on\nthe prison of accommodating DeHart's request for special\nmeals, and whether there are easy alternatives by which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The majority instructs the District Court to enter judgment for DeHart\nunless it can distinguish this case from Johnson on grounds other than\nthe central tenet issue. The majority's instruction is based on its\ninterpretation of Turner's requirement that in order for a regulation to\nbe\nrationally related to a legitimate penological interest, the regulation\nmust\nbe neutral. Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90. I do not believe Turner's\nneutrality\nrequirement supports the majority's directive, for it asks whether the\nchallenged regulation operates in a neutral way, without regard to the\ncontent of expression. Id. at 90. Moreover, we have previously explained\nthat Turner's neutrality requirement is met if the prison's asserted\ninterest giving rise to the regulation is unrelated to suppressing\nexpression.

We held in\nWaterman that New Jersey's interest in rehabilitating sex offenders was\nnot related to the suppression of expression, and the challenged\nregulation therefore was neutral. Id. So, too, the prison's interest here\nin\nan efficient food service system is not related to the suppression of\nreligious expression. Accordingly, its special diet regulation is neutral\nfor\npurposes of the Turner analysis.\n\n                               26\n\fDeHart can be accommodated at de minimus cost -- I agree\nthat further fact-finding is necessary. But unlike the\nmajority, I believe that on remand the court first must\nclarify the nature of DeHart's requested accommodation.\nDeHart frames the issue as a request for a vegetarian diet.\nVegetarian diets typically avoid meat, fish, and poultry.\nDeHart's proposed diet is more restrictive. Not only must it\nbe free of meat, fish, and poultry, but also free of eggs,\ndairy products, pungent root materials such as onions or\ngarlic, and any material derived from any animal product.\nIn this respect, DeHart's requested diet4 is even more\nrestrictive than a vegan diet (one disallowing all animal\nproducts) because it also would prohibit any non-animal\nfood or material that is prepared with animal products (for\nexample, vitamin supplements that may include bone\nderivatives or bread made with animal byproduct\npreservatives, both of which DeHart has declined). On this\npoint, it bears noting that the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit in Spies v. Voinovich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763122\"><a href=\"/opinion/763122/douglas-spies-v-george-v-voinovich/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n1999) (which the majority distinguishes) held that a prison\nwas not constitutionally required to provide a Buddhist\ninmate with a vegan diet. In sum, a clear understanding of\nthe precise nature and parameters of the special diet that\nDeHart seeks (for example, whether the diet prohibit fruits\nand vegetables that have been fertilized with organic\nmaterial) is essential to a proper assessment of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The majority apparently believes that DeHart can be accommodated\nwith extra portions of vegetables and bread, and with a cup of specially-\npurchased soy milk with each meal. But, as noted supra, the record\ncontains conflicting evidence as to the precise nature of the diet that\nDeHart seeks (including a \"beans and rice\" diet that DeHart suggested at\nthe preliminary injunction hearing). Moreover, DeHart has not rebutted\nthe testimony of the defendants' expert that the\"extra portions plus soy\nmilk\" diet fails to meet the relevant regulatory nutritional requirements\nfor inmates, is based on an out-of-date master prison menu (and is\ntherefore not accurate with respect to food items that the prison has\navailable), and cannot fully be evaluated because it proposes only a five-\nday menu, compared to the prison's forty-two day menu cycle. Unless\nDeHart addresses these issues on remand, his proposed diet does not\nappear to be a viable one.\n\n                               27\n\fresulting burden on the prison in complying with his\nrequest, and the overall balancing of the Turner factors.5\n\nIn assessing the burden on the prison of accommodating\nDeHart's request, I believe the majority fails to take\nsufficient account of the evidence of the potential for \"ripple\neffect\" within the prison. The Supreme Court has\nencouraged courts to give \"particular deference\" to the\ninformed discretion of corrections officials on this issue.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90.\n\nFinally, with respect to DeHart's equal protection claim\nthat he is being treated differently from Jewish inmates\nwho request and receive kosher meals, I do not believe that\nDeHart has stated a valid claim. In order to do so, he must\ncome forward with some evidence of discriminatory intent\non the part of the defendants. DeHart has not done so.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the grant of summary judgment\non this issue.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The majority's point as to the need for a bona fide balancing of the\nfactors is well-taken. But we have noted that in the course of conducting\nthat balancing, the first Turner factor \"looms especially large.\"\nWaterman,\n183 F.3d at 208.\n\n                                28\n\f</pre>",
