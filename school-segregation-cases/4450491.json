Standard of Review ............................................................................13\n         II.    Applying Texas law: the Award must be upheld ...............................14\n                A.       Without a complete record of the arbitration proceedings,\n                         Appellants cannot overcome the presumption in favor of\n                         upholding the Award................................................................15\n                         1.      The issues decided by the Arbitrator were\n                                 submitted in the arbitration, and without a\n                                 complete record, the trial court had to presume that\n                                 they were submitted .......................................................18\n                         2.      The evidence supported the damages awarded, and\n                                 without a complete record, the trial court had to\n                                 presume that it did .........................................................19\n                         3.      Appellants conceded the value of Dr. Bentz’s\n                                 membership interest, and without a complete\n                                 record, the trial court could not find otherwise ............. 22\n                B.       The Arbitrator properly exercised his broad authority\n                         under Section 9.02 to decide all disputes other than those\n                         decided under Section 9.01 ......................................................24\n                         1.      Section 9.02 gave the Arbitrator authority to\n                                 decide all disputes related to the Company\n                                 Agreement other than disputes resolved pursuant\n                                 to Section 9.01, and none of the disputes the\n                                 Arbitrator decided were, or could have been,\n                                 decided under Section 9.01 ............................................26\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                          - iii -\n\f                          2.       The Arbitrator had authority to decide the\n                                   appropriate remedies for the disputes submitted to\n                                   him under Section 9.02 ..................................................28\n                                   a.       There was no requirement that the parties\n                                            agree to the remedies selected by the\n                                            Arbitrator .............................................................29\n                                   b.       Dr. Bentz did seek to recover the Fair\n                                            Market Value of his interest, but regardless,\n                                            this was an issue for the Arbitrator to decide ...... 32\n                          3.       The Award was rationally inferable from the\n                                   Agreement, as shown by the Arbitrator’s well-\n                                   reasoned discussion in the Award .................................33\n                                   a.       The essence test does not allow the non-\n                                            prevailing party to retry the dispute ....................34\n                                   b.       The Arbitrator correctly determined that\n                                            Dr. Bentz was still a member after expulsion .....35\n                 C.       The Arbitrator did not award a double recovery, but even\n                          if he had, it would not be grounds for vacatur .........................39\n                          1.       Double recoveries do not warrant vacatur .....................39\n                                   a.       Prohibiting double recoveries is not so\n                                            fundamental a policy that it would outweigh\n                                            public policy in favor of upholding\n                                            arbitration awards ................................................40\n                                   b.       Violating public policy is not a ground for\n                                            vacatur under the Federal Arbitration Act .......... 43\n                          2.       The Award compensates Dr. Bentz for separate\n                                   injuries and therefore does not grant a double\n                                   recovery .........................................................................45\n                 D.       Even if the Court were to vacate the Award, it could not\n                          order the modification that Appellants request ........................47\nCONCLUSION .......................................................................................................49\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE ...............................................................................51\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE ......................................................................52\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                             - iv -\n\fAPPENDIX\n    1.

Appellants’ Joint Brief at 1, n. 3. When Dr. Bentz\n\nrefused this low-ball offer, the Individual Appellants made good on their threat and\n\nvoted to expel him. Id. Under the Company Agreement, 2 however, Dr. Bentz\n\nremained a member of the Company until he sold his membership interest.\n\nC.R. 1489.3 After the expulsion vote, the Company elected to exercise its option\n\nunder the Company Agreement to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest, but\n\nthe Company later refused to pay the purchase price, which was Fair Market\n\nValue. Id. The Company also began paying Dr. Bentz’s share of the membership\n\ndistributions to the Individual Appellants instead of Dr. Bentz. Id. at 1490.\n\n\n\n1\n  “The Company” refers to appellants Northwest Houston Emergency Specialists, P.L.L.C.\n(“NHESG”), ESG MD, P.L.L.C., and ESG MLP, L.L.C, collectively. “The Individual\nAppellants” refers to Dr. George Davis, Dr. Levon Vartanian, Dr. Anteneh Roba, and\nDr. Woodrow Dolino, collectively. “Appellants,” as used herein, refers to the Company and the\nIndividual Appellants, collectively.\n2\n  “Company Agreement” refers to the Company Agreements of each of the Company entities,\nwhich are identical except for the name of the entity. See C.R. 112–136 (the Company\nAgreement).\n3\n  The Clerk’s Record is cited herein as “C.R. _________.”\n\n\n54069386.3                                 - ix -\n\f         The parties participated in a 5-day arbitration hearing in August 2014. A\n\ncomplete transcript of the arbitration hearing was not made. At the hearing, and\n\nthrough extensive pre- and post-hearing briefing, Dr. Bentz showed that the\n\nAppellants’ actions constituted breaches of the Company Agreement, conversion,\n\nand breaches of fiduciary duties. C.R. 1489–90. The Arbitrator then issued an\n\narbitration award in Dr. Bentz’s favor (the “Award”). See id. at 1488–92. The\n\nAward granted Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value purchase price of his membership\n\ninterest, his distributions that were wrongfully paid to the Individual Appellants,\n\npre-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees. Id. at 1489–91. The Arbitrator also\n\ndeclared that Dr. Bentz had remained a member of the Company until the date of\n\nthe Award. Id. at 1490.\n\n         Dr. Bentz then moved the trial court to confirm the Award. C.R. 1321–\n\n1325. Unhappy with the Award, Appellants filed motions opposing confirmation\n\nin which they sought to re-litigate the merits of the arbitration. C.R. 1413–1444,\n\n1605–1623. But the Honorable Patricia Kerrigan, Judge of the 190th Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Harris County, Texas, confirmed the Award, denied Appellants’\n\nmotions to vacate the Award, and signed the Judgment in Dr. Bentz’s favor.\n\nC.R. 1794–98. Appellants’ motions for reconsideration of the confirmation were\n\ndenied, and Appellants filed a notice of appeal on March 9, 2015. C.R. 1962–63.\n\nThis appeal follows.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              -x-\n\f               STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n         In this appeal, Appellants ask the Court to ignore Texas’s strong\n\npresumption in favor of arbitration awards and set aside a just arbitration award\n\nrendered by an arbitrator who acted with full authority. Furthermore, Appellants\n\nmisconstrue the Award and ask this Court to rely on an incomplete record in order\n\nto overturn it. Thus, and as shown more fully below, Appellants’ asserted points of\n\nerror run so contrary to Texas law that they do not merit oral argument before the\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                             - xi -\n\f                     STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nIssue 1:       Did the trial court err by Confirming the Award over Appellants’\n\nopposition when:\n\n         (a)   The Arbitrator followed the Company Agreement’s mandate that all\n\n               disputes be arbitrated other than disputes over the narrow issues\n\n               enumerated in Section 9.01?\n\n         (b)   The Arbitrator awarded Dr. Bentz that portion of Dr. Bentz’s\n\n               membership distributions which the Individual Appellants took for\n\n               themselves despite Dr. Bentz’s continuing right to those distributions\n\n               during the time period in which Dr. Bentz continued to own his\n\n               membership interest?\n\nIssue 2:       Did the trial court err by confirming the Award over Appellants’\n\nopposition by awarding damages to Dr. Bentz for the Company’s failure to\n\ncomplete the contractual process to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest and\n\nfor the Company’s payment of Dr. Bentz’s membership distributions to the\n\nIndividual Appellants during that time that Dr. Bentz was still a member of the\n\nCompany?\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - xii -\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n         Dr. Bentz and the Individual Appellants founded the Company, and each had\n\na 20% membership interest. C.R. 112–13, 136. The Company was composed of\n\nthree limited liability companies, and (along with NHESG’s wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, Houston Northwest Emergency Specialists, PLLC), it staffed the\n\nemergency department of Houston Northwest Medical Center. Appellants’ Joint\n\nBrief at 1. Over the years, Dr. Bentz served in various administrative and business\n\ncapacities for the Company, which became quite successful.          See C.R. 1564\n\n(Company income statement showing yearly profits in the millions from 2009 to\n\n2011).\n\n         By mid-2011, however, Dr. Bentz’s relationship with the Individual\n\nAppellants had soured over clashes of personalities, and the Individual Appellants\n\ndecided to oust him. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 1, n. 3. The Appellants offered\n\nDr. Bentz a Hobson’s choice in late 2011: the Company would pay him a mere\n\n$100,000 to buy his membership interest, or the Individual Appellants would vote\n\nto expel Dr. Bentz from the Company. Id. When Dr. Bentz refused this low-ball\n\noffer, the Individual Appellants voted to expel him. Id.\n\n         Under the Company Agreement, however, expulsion did not cause a\n\nmember to automatically lose his membership interest.        C.R. 1489.    Instead,\n\nexpulsion merely triggered the Company’s and the other members’ right—but not\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              -1-\n\fobligation—to force the expelled member to sell his membership interest.\n\nC.R. 1489; see also C.R. 114 at § 2.05 (“…during a period of 180 days following\n\nthe expulsion of a Member, the Company and the other Members shall have an\n\noption (but not an obligation) to purchase all of the Membership Interest owned by\n\nsuch…expelled Member….”).           If the Company or other members elected to\n\nexercise that option, the Company Agreement required instruments conveying the\n\nmembership interest to be exchanged for the purchase price at a closing. C.R. 115\n\nat § 2.08. The purchase price would be “Fair Market Value” as defined in the\n\nCompany Agreement. See id. at § 2.09. There were no provisions for transferring\n\na membership interest in the event the Company or the other members exercised\n\ntheir option to purchase the expelled member’s membership interest then failed to\n\nclose and pay the purchase price.\n\n         After the Individual Appellants voted to expel Dr. Bentz, the Company\n\nelected to exercise its option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest.\n\nAppellants’ Joint Brief at 1. While that process was pending, Dr. Bentz remained a\n\nmember. C.R. 1489–90. During that time, however, the Company did not pay\n\nDr. Bentz his share of membership distributions and instead paid them to the\n\nIndividual Appellants. C.R. 1489. For these reasons, amongst others, Dr. Bentz\n\nfiled for arbitration on November 1, 2012 under the arbitration provision of\n\nSection 9.02 of the Company Agreement, which provided a mechanism for\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -2-\n\fresolving “any Dispute under [the Company Agreement] which [was] not\n\notherwise resolved pursuant to other procedures under Section 9.01.”              See\n\nC.R. 128–29 at § 9.02; see also C.R. 137–153.\n\n         Section 9.02’s broad scope contrasted with the narrow scope of Section 9.01,\n\nwhich only provided procedures to decide limited issues. Compare C.R. 128–29 at\n\n§ 9.02 with C.R. 127–28 at § 9.01. In relevant part, Section 9.01 provided a\n\nprocedure to determine the “controlling opinion” on the Fair Market Value of a\n\nmembership interest. C.R. 127 at § 9.01(a). Per that procedure, Dr. Bentz and the\n\nCompany       each   appointed    appraisers   (the   “party-appointed   appraisers”).\n\nC.R. 1418, 1489. Both party-appointed appraisers then opined on the Fair Market\n\nValue of Dr. Bentz’s membership interest.         C.R. 1418.    The party-appointed\n\nappraisers also appointed a third appraiser (the “common appraiser”), whose sole\n\ntask under Section 9.01 was to determine “which opinion [was] the controlling\n\nopinion . . .” on the Fair Market Value of a membership interest. Id.; C.R. 127–28\n\nat § 9.01. Aside from the selection of the controlling opinion on Fair Market\n\nValue, there were only two other issues that could be decided under Section 9.01:\n\n(1) who would serve as the party-appointed appraiser for the purchasers of a\n\nmembership interest; and (2) who would serve as the common appraiser. See\n\nC.R. 127–28 at § 9.01. Neither of those two issues are relevant in this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -3-\n\f         While the Section 9.01 proceeding to determine the controlling opinion was\n\npending, the Individual Appellants moved to stay the Section 9.02 arbitration,\n\narguing that any Section 9.01 proceeding had to be completed before the\n\narbitration could proceed under Section 9.02. C.R. 102–11. On April 4, 2013, the\n\ntrial court ordered the Section 9.02 arbitration stayed until the Section 9.01\n\nprocedure was completed. C.R. 522–24.\n\n         On January 3, 2014, the common appraiser chose the opinion of the\n\nCompany’s appraiser, Reed Tinsley, as the controlling opinion.                        C.R. 1418.\n\nMr. Tinsley’s opinion was that the Fair Market Value was either $257,969 under\n\nan asset approach, or $526,796 under an income approach. C.R. 1555. With this\n\nopinion chosen as the controlling opinion, the Section 9.01 proceeding was\n\ncomplete.4 No other issues in the dispute were to be decided (or indeed, could be\n\ndecided) under Section 9.01. The path was clear for the Section 9.02 arbitration to\n\ncontinue to resolve all other disputes between the parties.\n\n4\n  Appellants repeatedly state throughout their brief that the Section 9.01 proceeding was\ncompleted. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 11 (“The parties finished the Section 9.01 process and a\n‘Fair Market Value’ was determined. . . .”), 18 (“The determination of the controlling opinion as\nto Fair Market Value by Mr. Mr. Carr concluded the Section 9.01 Fair Market Value process.”),\n20 (“Once the Section 9.01 process was finished, the parties moved to arbitration.”), and 26\n(“The Section 9.01 proceeding was concluded on January 3, 2014.”). It is unclear, then, why\nAppellants suggest at the end of their brief that the Section 9.01 proceeding has not ended. Id. at\n46 (“If the Award against the Company is vacated, the Section 9.01 process remains open until\nthe parties close on the purchase option.”); n.38 (“This appeal must be resolved before the parties\ncan conclude the Section 9.01 process. . . .”). In any event, as described below in Section II.B.1,\nthe common appraiser had, as of the time of the Section 9.02 arbitration, already decided the\nonly issue before him under Section 9.01—that is, which party-appointed appraiser’s opinion\nwas the controlling opinion on Fair Market Value.\n\n\n54069386.3                                     -4-\n\f         After the Section 9.02 arbitration process resumed, the parties engaged in\n\nextensive discovery, deposed seven individuals, and submitted over 100 pages of\n\nprehearing briefing.     C.R. 1324; see also C.R. 1419 (discussing post-hearing\n\nbriefing submitted to the Arbitrator). The hearing was then held from August 19,\n\n2014 through August 22, 2014, and reconvened for a final day on August 29, 2014.\n\nC.R. 1488. At the hearing, the Arbitrator received the testimony of Dr. Bentz, each\n\nof the four Individual Appellants, three non-party witnesses, and three expert\n\nwitnesses. C.R. 1324, 1488. The Individual Appellants elected to have a court\n\nreporter transcribe part of the opening statements and part of Dr. Bentz’s\n\ntestimony, but they declined to have the court reporter transcribe the rest, and no\n\nother party made any record of the hearing.         See C.R. 1782–93 (part of the\n\nincomplete record).       Appellants conceded that the Fair Market Value of\n\nDr. Bentz’s membership interest was $526,796. See C.R. 1489 (“All Parties have\n\nacknowledged… that the appropriate Fair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s\n\nMembership Interest is $526,796.”). Following the arbitration hearing, each party\n\nsubmitted post-hearing briefs to supplement the Parties’ already-extensive\n\nprehearing briefs. Id.\n\n         The Arbitrator then issued the Award on October 15, 2014. C.R. 1488. In\n\nit, the Arbitrator found that “all Parties have acknowledged. . . that the appropriate\n\nFair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s Membership Interests [was] $526,796,” a figure\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -5-\n\fconsistent with the controlling opinion from the Section 9.01 proceedings.\n\nC.R. 1489, 1555. The Arbitrator determined that Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\nthat sum because the Company breached the Company Agreement by electing to\n\nexercise the option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s interest and then failing to pay the\n\npurchase price by the contractual deadline.              C.R. 1489.     The Arbitrator also\n\ndetermined that Dr. Bentz was entitled to his pro rata share of membership\n\ndistributions made while Dr. Bentz remained a member because “[c]ommon sense,\n\nlogic and a careful reading of the Agreements compel that, until paid for his\n\nInterest, a Member, even an expelled Member, is entitled to his share of any\n\ndistributions made by the [Company].” C.R. 1490. Finally, the Arbitrator also\n\nawarded Dr. Bentz pre-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.5 C.R. 1491.\n\n         The trial court later confirmed the Award over Appellants’ objections,\n\nentered the Judgment, and denied Appellants’ motions for reconsideration.\n\nC.R. 1794–98, 1962. Shortly afterward, Appellants sued the law firm and attorney\n\nwho had drafted the Company Agreement, alleging that they committed\n\nmalpractice. C.R. 1942–52. Appellants further alleged that they had already\n\nsatisfied the Judgment—though they had not and have not done so. See C.R. 1950\n\n5\n  Per the Company Agreement, the Arbitrator awarded attorneys’ fees to Dr. Bentz because he\nwas a substantially prevailing party. See C.R. 131 at § 9.03 (“In the event a proceeding under\nthis Article 9 is commenced…the party who prevails or substantially prevails in such proceeding\nshall be entitled to recover . . . all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in\nconnection with the proceeding and on appeal.”); C.R. 1491 (“…Claimant substantially prevailed\nin his claims and is entitled to recover his costs, expenses and reasonable attorney fees.”).\n\n\n54069386.3                                    -6-\n\f(characterizing the award of distributions and attorneys’ fees to Dr. Bentz as\n\n“pecuniary losses” that “Plaintiffs sustained. . . .”); C.R. 1947 (stating that a sum\n\nmentioned earlier in the petition “does not include any portion of the $532,064\n\npaid to Bentz to buy-out his membership share . . . .”) (emphasis added). This\n\nappeal follows.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              -7-\n\f                        SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n         At the crux of this appeal is Appellants’ refusal to recognize that, under\n\nSection 9.02 of the Company Agreement, they agreed to arbitrate “any Dispute\n\nunder [the Company Agreement] which [was] not otherwise resolved pursuant to\n\nother procedures under Section 9.01,” which is exactly what happened when the\n\nparties submitted their dispute to the Arbitrator. In contrast, Section 9.01 provided\n\nmechanisms for the narrow determinations of: (1) who would serve as the party-\n\nappointed appraiser for a purchase of a membership interest, (2) who would serve\n\nas the common appraiser, and (3) which party-appointed appraiser’s opinion would\n\nbe the controlling opinion on the Fair Market Value of a membership interest.\n\nNone of these issues were decided in the Section 9.02 arbitration. Rather, after a\n\nfive-day hearing and over a month of deliberation, the Arbitrator properly\n\ndetermined, amongst other things, that: (1) Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\ndamages from the Company for its failure to buy Dr. Bentz’s membership interest\n\nafter electing to exercise its option to do so; (2) Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\ndamages from the Individual Appellants for their wrongful appropriation of his pro\n\nrata share of membership distributions; and (3) Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\nattorneys’ fees per the Company Agreement because he substantially prevailed in\n\nthe arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -8-\n\f         Appellants would have the Court believe that this dispute was actually about\n\none thing: the propriety of Dr. Bentz’s expulsion from the Company. Although the\n\nparties did dispute the propriety of Dr. Bentz’s expulsion, the parties also disputed\n\nwhat happened to Dr. Bentz’s membership interest if he had been properly\n\nexpelled, and resolving this dispute required interpretation of the Company\n\nAgreement—an issue for arbitration under Section 9.02.           Under the Company\n\nAgreement, a member’s expulsion triggered the Company’s and the other\n\nmembers’ right—but not obligation—to buy the member’s membership interest at\n\nthe Fair Market Value.\n\n         Here, upon Dr. Bentz’s expulsion, the Company elected to exercise their\n\noption to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interests but then refused to complete\n\nthe purchase by paying Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value. And, even though no one\n\nhad paid Dr. Bentz for his membership interest, Appellants claimed that\n\nDr. Bentz’s membership interest had disappeared and that he was no longer\n\nentitled to his share of membership distributions. On the other hand, Dr. Bentz\n\nargued that because his membership interest was his personal property, he\n\ncontinued to own the interest and its attendant membership distribution rights until\n\nhe transferred it.     See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE § 101.106 (West 2015) (“A\n\nmembership interest in a limited liability company is personal property.”) This is\n\nthe same merits-based dispute that is at issue in this appeal.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -9-\n\f         The Arbitrator has already decided this dispute, and he agreed with\n\nDr. Bentz’s interpretation of the Company Agreement and Texas law.               The\n\nArbitrator therefore awarded Dr. Bentz the damages he was entitled to: payment\n\nfor his membership interest, his unpaid share of the membership distributions,\n\nattorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest, and costs.\n\n         Because Appellants do not like the Arbitrator’s decision, they now wish to\n\nretry the merits of the dispute.      Knowing that courts defer to arbitrators to\n\ndetermine the merits, however, Appellants have recast their claims in the form of\n\njurisdictional arguments. Appellants claim first that the Arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority because the parties did not agree to grant the Arbitrator the authority to\n\naward Dr. Bentz the recoveries contained in the Award. This argument, however,\n\nignores the fact that, by assenting to the Company Agreement, the Appellants\n\nagreed to resolve these disputes under the broad ambit of Section 9.02, and the trial\n\ncourt properly rejected it.\n\n         Appellants also claim that the Award includes a double recovery and that\n\nTexas’s common law policy against double recoveries is so extraordinary and\n\nfundamental that its violation requires vacatur here. Appellants’ argument fails\n\nbecause, as two other courts of appeals have held, the award of a double recovery\n\ndoes not warrant vacatur. Appellants’ argument also fails because common law\n\ngrounds for vacatur—such as vacating an arbitration award because it violates\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 10 -\n\fpublic policy—are not grounds for vacatur under the Federal Arbitration Act,\n\nwhich applies here. In any event, the Award does not include a double recovery\n\nbecause its different components compensate Dr. Bentz for different injuries.\n\n         Finally, Appellants request to modify the Award so that the Award would:\n\n(1) maintain the only aspect of the Award favorable to Appellants (the Arbitrator’s\n\ndetermination that Dr. Bentz was expelled using the proper procedures); (2)\n\ninclude a determination the Arbitrator never made (that Appellants did not breach\n\nthe Company Agreement); and (3) delete the other components of the Award\n\n(which were unfavorable to Appellants).         These requested modifications are\n\nimpermissible because Appellants did not preserve this argument for appeal, they\n\nwould give Appellants relief they did not request, and they would improperly\n\nsegregate intertwined issues.\n\n         The Arbitrator properly interpreted Texas law and the Company Agreement,\n\nand he acted within his authority in doing so. The trial court accordingly showed\n\ndue deference to the Arbitrator’s well-reasoned decision. This Court should not\n\ndisturb the trial court’s decision, because doing so would not only upset Texas’s\n\nstrong presumption in favor of arbitration awards; it would undo a just Award\n\nrendered with full authority. It has been nearly four years since the Individual\n\nAppellants voted to expel Dr. Bentz, and Dr. Bentz has yet to receive any\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                             - 11 -\n\fcompensation for the harm Appellants inflicted upon him. The Court should reject\n\nAppellants’ latest stalling tactic6 and affirm the Judgment.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  There is a real risk that Appellants’ stalling tactics may prevent Dr. Bentz from obtaining\nsatisfaction of the Award and Judgment. See C.R. 1608 (“The Hospital Contract was the\n[Company’s] sole source of revenue, and the [Company] held little in the way of additional\nassets. On October 31, 2013, during the pendency of the underlying arbitration proceedings, the\nHospital Contract terminated when the Hospital elected not to renew it. The [Company] has\nearned no additional revenues since that time (though trailing collections continued to trickle in\nover the next several months).

Standard of Review\n\n         Appellants urge the Court to undertake a sweeping review of the Arbitrator’s\n\nreasoning and set aside portions of the Award despite the fact that review of an\n\narbitration award is “extraordinarily narrow.” GJR Mgmt. Holdings, L.P. v. Jack\n\nRaus, Ltd., 126 S.W.3d 257, 262 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied).\n\nUpon a party’s application, the court “shall confirm [an] award . . .

Applying Texas law: the Award must be upheld.\n\n         Appellants raise two main issues on appeal. Appellants’ Joint Brief at xiv.\n\nFirst, Appellants claim that the trial court erred in confirming the Award because\n\nthe Arbitrator exceeded his authority under the Company Agreement. Id. at 23–31.\n\nAppellants also sprinkle this first issue with various evidentiary challenges to the\n\nAward. Id. at 15–31. Second, Appellants claim that the trial court erred in\n\nconfirming the Award because the Award violated an extraordinary, fundamental\n\npublic policy by awarding a double recovery. Id. at 31–42. As a remedy for these\n\nsupposed deficiencies, Appellants ask the Court to modify the Award so that the\n\nAward declares that Dr. Bentz was properly expelled and that Appellants did not\n\nbreach the Company Agreement. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 42–47.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 14 -\n\f         As described more fully below, Appellants’ claims fail because: (A) without\n\na complete record of the arbitration proceedings, Appellants cannot overcome the\n\nstrong presumption in favor of upholding the Award; (B) the Arbitrator properly\n\nexercised his Section 9.02 authority to decide all disputes related to the Company\n\nAgreement other than those disputes decided under Section 9.01; (C) the Arbitrator\n\ndid not award a double recovery, but regardless, awarding a double recovery does\n\nnot warrant vacatur; and (D) even if the Court questions the trial court’s\n\nconfirmation of the Award, it cannot order the modification that Appellants\n\nrequest.\n\n         A.    Without a complete record of the arbitration proceedings,\n               Appellants cannot overcome the presumption in favor of\n               upholding the Award.\n\n         When “a non-prevailing party seeks to modify or vacate an arbitrator’s\n\naward, he bears the burden to bring forth a complete record that establishes his\n\nbasis for relief.” Anzilotti, 899 S.W.2d at 267 (emphasis added) (citing Kline, 874\n\nS.W.2d at 790). “A court must have a sufficient record of the arbitral proceedings,\n\nand complaints must have been preserved, all as if the award were a court\n\njudgment on appeal.” Nafta Traders Inc. v. Quinn, 339 S.W.3d 84, 101 (Tex.\n\n2011). In order to be a complete record, the record must include a full transcript of\n\nthe arbitration hearing. Statewide Remodeling, Inc. v. Williams, 244 S.W.3d 564,\n\n569 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.) (where party claimed arbitrator committed a\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 15 -\n\fgross mistake and awarded a measure of damages not requested, appellate court\n\nheld that it “[could not] conclude the trial court erred in holding [the party] to the\n\nburden of bringing forth a complete record of the arbitration proceedings,\n\nincluding a transcript of the arbitration hearing.”). Absent a transcript of the\n\narbitration, “[n]either the attorneys’ recollection of what testimony was or was not\n\nbefore the arbitrator nor the attachments to the motion to vacate provide a complete\n\nrecord of the arbitration proceedings.” Statewide Remodeling, 244 S.W.3d at 569.\n\n         Where, as here, the non-prevailing party fails to provide the court with a\n\ncomplete record, the court must presume that the evidence supports the arbitration\n\naward and uphold that award. See Nafta Traders, 339 S.W.3d at 102 (“If error\n\ncannot be demonstrated, an award must be presumed correct.”); Goldman v.\n\nBuchanan, No. 05-12-00050-CV, 2013 WL 1281744, at *3 (Tex.

The informal nature of arbitration\n\ndoes not release a party from its burden to bring forward a complete record,\n\nbecause “[w]ithout a record,” a court “cannot conclusively determine the basis for\n\nthe arbitrator’s award. . . .” 7 Vorwerk v. Williamson County Grain, No. 03-10-\n\n00549-CV, 2012 WL 593481, at *6 (Tex. App.—Austin Feb. 23, 2012, pet.\n\ndenied) (citing GJR Mgmt., 126 S.W.3d at 263 and Statewide Remodeling, 244\n\nS.W.3d at 569–70). Appellants claim that a complete record of the arbitration\n\nproceedings is not required for this Court to determine that the Arbitrator exceeded\n\nhis authority. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 15. That is incorrect, and Appellants have\n\ncited no cases in which an appellate court ruled that an arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority while relying on an incomplete record.                   Instead, Appellants cite\n\nCentex/Vestal v. Friendship West Baptist Church, which does not support their\n\nargument. 314 S.W.3d 677 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, pet. denied).\n\n         In Centex/Vestal, the non-prevailing party brought forth no record at all as to\n\none claim the arbitrator decided. Id. at 687. Accordingly, the court concluded that\n\nthe “failure to bring forth a complete record of the arbitration proceeding [was]\n\n7\n  The Supreme Court aptly described the public policy supporting the requirement that a party\nbring forth a complete record on appeal: “For efficiency’s sake, arbitration proceedings are often\ninformal; procedural rules are relaxed, rules of evidence are not followed, and no record is made.\nThese aspects of arbitration, which are key to reducing costs and delay in resolving disputes,\nmust fall casualty to the requirements for full judicial review. The parties can decide for\nthemselves whether the benefits are worth the additional cost and delay, but the only review to\nwhich they can agree is the kind of review courts conduct.” Nafta Traders, 339 S.W.3d at 101–\n02.\n\n\n54069386.3                                    - 17 -\n\ffatal” to the claim for vacatur. Id. As to other claims the arbitrator decided, the\n\ncourt considered the limited record provided to it and determined that the arbitrator\n\nacted within his authority on those claims. Id. at 685–86. In deciding that the\n\narbitrator did not exceed his authority, the court considered the partial record, but\n\n“presume[d] any remaining evidence support[ed] the Award.” Id. at 685. And in\n\nthe end, the court found that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in deciding\n\nthose claims.       Id. at 686.   This Court is presented with a similar situation;\n\nAppellants provided only a limited record, so the Court must “presume any\n\nremaining evidence supports the Award.” Id. at 685. As explained more fully\n\nbelow, this presumption defeats Appellants’ claim for vacatur.\n\n               1.     The issues decided by the Arbitrator were submitted in the\n                      arbitration, and without a complete record, the trial court\n                      had to presume that they were submitted.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Arbitrator issued an Award on issues not submitted\n\nto him. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23–27. However, the Arbitrator did not rule on\n\nany issues not submitted to him, and, moreover, the Court must reject Appellants’\n\nclaim to the contrary because the Court “do[es] not have a record of the arbitration\n\nand [is] unable to determine what claims were submitted or what evidence was\n\noffered before the arbitrator[].” Kline, 874 S.W.2d at 783. Without a record of the\n\nhearing, the court “ha[s] no way of knowing whether a fact issue was raised, or for\n\nthat matter, whether certain issues were tried by consent.” Brockman v. Tyson, No.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 18 -\n\f01-03-01335-CV, 2005 WL 2850128, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Oct.\n\n27, 2005, pet. denied). Accordingly, “[w]ithout a transcription of the arbitration\n\nproceedings, [the court] must presume adequate evidence to support the award.”\n\nKline, 874 S.W.2d at 783 (citing House Grain Co. v. Obst, 659 S.W.2d 903, 906\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1983, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).\n\n               2.    The evidence supported the damages awarded, and without\n                     a complete record, the trial court had to presume that it did.\n\n         Appellants next claim that the Award failed the “essence” test because it is\n\nnot “rationally inferable” from the agreement. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 28. They\n\nalso argue that the Award constitutes an impermissible double recovery. Id. at 31–\n\n34. The validity of these arguments implicates factual and legal questions, both of\n\nwhich were fully briefed and argued to the Arbitrator, but most of those briefings\n\nand arguments are not part of the record before this Court.\n\n         As more thoroughly explained to the Arbitrator through briefing, oral\n\nargument, and expert testimony, awarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his\n\ninterest and his share of distributions compensates Dr. Bentz for two different\n\ninjuries.    First, awarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest\n\ncompensates Dr. Bentz for the Company’s failure to purchase Dr. Bentz’s 20%\n\nmembership interest after it elected to do so.       C.R. 1489.   Second, awarding\n\nDr. Bentz damages equal to the distributions the Individual Appellants wrongfully\n\nappropriated compensates Dr. Bentz for the membership distributions he should\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 19 -\n\fhave received while he remained a member of the Company. C.R. 1490. Thus,\n\nDr. Bentz was awarded separate damages for the violation of two separate\n\ncontractual rights—his right to the purchase price of his membership interest and\n\nhis right to distributions while he remained a member.\n\n         At the arbitration hearing, Appellants’ own damages expert conceded that\n\nawarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value and his share of distributions would not\n\nbe a double recovery if Dr. Bentz were found to still be a member of the Company\n\nafter expulsion—which is, in fact, what the Arbitrator found. C.R. 1489. This\n\ntestimony is not included in the appellate record because Appellants failed to\n\nprovide the trial court with a complete record. But, without a complete record of\n\nthe hearing, Appellants cannot rebut the presumption that the evidence supported\n\nthe award of Fair Market Value and distributions—and, in fact, it did.\n\n         In an instructive case, CC Williams Construction Co., Inc. v. Rico, the non-\n\nprevailing party sought vacatur on the basis that the arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority and granted a double recovery to the prevailing party, but the non-\n\nprevailing party failed to provide a transcript of the hearing. No. 09-10-00472-CV,\n\n2011 WL 2135074, at *2–3 (Tex. App.—Beaumont May 19, 2011, no pet.). This\n\nfailure was fatal to the claim for vacatur. Id. The court held:\n\n         The record does not indicate that the [non-prevailing party] provided\n         the trial court with a complete record, i.e., a transcript of the\n         arbitration proceedings. See Williams, 244 S.W.3d at 569 (Finding\n         that the trial court did not err by requiring non-prevailing party to\n\n54069386.3                               - 20 -\n\f         provide a transcript of arbitration proceedings, even when no such\n         transcript was made and the party provided affidavits, exhibits, and an\n         attorney’s testimony regarding what occurred at the arbitration\n         proceeding). The [non-prevailing party’s] grounds for vacatur all\n         depend on the evidence offered and considered by the arbitrator and\n         the manner in which the arbitrator conducted the proceedings, none of\n         which the record contains. . . . We, therefore, presume that the\n         arbitration evidence supported the award. . . .\n\n         Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court erred by\n         refusing to confirm the arbitration award and by setting aside and\n         vacating the award.\n\nId. at *3.\n\n         Recently, the Fourteenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued another instructive\n\nopinion in Mega Builders, Inc. v. Paramount Stores, Inc. No. 14-14-00744-CV,\n\n2015 WL 3429060 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] May 28, 2015, no pet. h.). In\n\nMega Builders, the appellant argued that the arbitrator “double count[ed]” a sum\n\nawarded to the appellee. Id. at *2. As in CC Williams Construction, however, the\n\nappellant’s failure to provide a record of the arbitration proceedings proved fatal to\n\nits claim for vacatur. Id. at *3. The court explained:\n\n         [B]ecause we have no record of the arbitration proceedings, we cannot\n         determine whether the two entries constitute a double counting, as\n         [the appellant] alleges, or whether the two entries were intentionally\n         included in the calculation of the award based on the evidence\n         submitted to the arbitrator, as [the appellee] argues. Absent a record,\n         we must presume that the record supports the arbitrator’s\n         determination of the proper amount of the award.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 21 -\n\f         Here, as in CC Williams Construction and Mega Builders, Appellants have\n\nnot met their burden to provide a complete record. Accordingly, the Court must\n\npresume that the record that it lacks supports the Award.\n\n               3.    Appellants conceded the value of Dr. Bentz’s membership\n                     interest, and without a complete record, the trial court\n                     could not find otherwise.\n\n         The lack of a complete record requires the Court to reject Appellants’\n\nargument that the Arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding a dispute as to the\n\nFair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s interest. In support of their argument, Appellants\n\ncite seven pages of an unofficial transcript from the opening presentations during\n\nthe first day of the hearing. Appellants’ Brief at 21 (citing C.R. 1787–93). But\n\neven this unofficial transcript demonstrates the Individual Appellants’ willingness\n\nfor the Arbitrator to award Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest as long\n\nas it was within the range decided in the Section 9.01 proceeding:\n\n         Mr. Mussalli: What I think would help us is, you know, if there’s an\n         agreement that, you know, if say let’s allow Mr. Wood to determine –\n         there’s the word determine again – let’s allow Mr. Wood to choose, so\n         to speak, as long as you don’t exceed the higher number.\n\nC.R. 1790 at 74:11–16.\n\n         Appellants’ reliance on arguments presented at the hearing underscores the\n\nvery reason that Texas law imposes a burden upon the non-prevailing party to\n\nbring forth a complete record of the arbitration: the Court cannot review the\n\npropriety of the Arbitrator’s exercise of his powers without a record of what\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 22 -\n\fhappened. Here, the lack of a complete record prevents the Court from reviewing\n\nthe testimony and arguments from the rest of the hearing. And what happened at\n\nthe rest of the hearing is important.\n\n         Over the course of the hearing, Appellants did not argue that $526,796 was\n\nnot the Fair Market Value. Rather, as the Arbitrator stated in the Award, “[a]ll\n\nParties [] acknowledged. . . that the appropriate Fair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s\n\nMembership Interests [was] $526,796.” C.R. 1489. The Court must presume the\n\ntruthfulness of the Arbitrator’s statement. See Turner v. Package Exp., L.P., No.\n\n14-12-00241-CV, 2013 WL 2149786, at *6 n.8 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\nMay 16, 2013, no pet.) (because the arbitrator’s award stated that the non-\n\nprevailing party “stated in his Closing Brief that he did not want to pursue any\n\nclaims against [the prevailing party],” and the Closing Brief was not included in\n\nthe appellate record, the court presumed that the Closing Brief supported the\n\narbitrator’s decision).    Therefore, although Appellants now claim that the\n\nArbitrator improperly decided a dispute as to the Fair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s\n\ninterest, the Award reflects that, by the close of the hearing (at the latest), there\n\nwas no longer a dispute as to the Fair Market Value. Had a full record of the\n\nhearing been made, it would show that the Arbitrator did not exceed his powers.\n\nBut without a complete record, the Court must abide by the presumption in favor\n\nof upholding the Award.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 23 -\n\f         B.    The Arbitrator properly exercised his broad authority under\n               Section 9.02 to decide all disputes other than those decided under\n               Section 9.01.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority in issuing the\n\nAward. Appellants’ Joint Brief at xiv. When deciding whether an arbitrator acted\n\nwithin his jurisdiction, the “appropriate inquiry is not whether the arbitrator\n\ndecided an issue correctly, but instead whether he had the authority to decide the\n\nissue at all.” Forest Oil Corp. v. El Rucio Land and Cattle Co., Inc., 446 S.W.3d\n\n58, 81 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] July 24, 2014, pet. filed) (citing D.R.\n\nHorton—Texas, Ltd. v. Bernhard, 423 S.W.3d 532, 534 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2014, pet. denied)).      Further, “there is a presumption that the\n\narbitrator’s actions were within his authority, and [the Court] [must] resolve all\n\ndoubts in favor of the award.” Barton v. Fashion Glass and Mirror, Ltd., 321\n\nS.W.3d 641, 646 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.); Prudential Sec.\n\nInc. v. Marshall, 909 S.W.2d 896, 899 (Tex. 1995). The burden is therefore “on\n\nthe party challenging the award to prove the arbitrator acted outside his authority.”\n\nId. “[W]hen, as here, there is a broad arbitration clause, arbitration of a particular\n\nclaim should not be denied unless it can be said ‘with positive assurance that the\n\narbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the dispute.’”\n\nCentex/Vestal, 314 S.W.3d at 685–86 (quoting Kline, 874 S.W.2d at 782).\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 24 -\n\f         In support of their claim that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority,\n\nAppellants make several faulty arguments. They argue that the Arbitrator did not\n\nhave authority to award Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest and\n\ndistributions because those remedies were barred by Section 9.01. Appellants’\n\nJoint Brief at 21–23. They also argue that there was no agreement to award\n\nDr. Bentz a “buyout.” Id. at 22–27. Finally, they argue that the Award fails the\n\n“essence” test because it was not “rationally inferable” from the agreement. Id. at\n\n28.\n\n         These arguments fail for several reasons: (1) Section 9.02 of the Company\n\nAgreement gave the Arbitrator the authority to decide all disputes related to the\n\nCompany Agreement other than disputes resolved pursuant to Section 9.01, and\n\nnone of the disputes the Arbitrator decided were, or even could have been, decided\n\nunder Section 9.01; (2) the Arbitrator had authority to decide the appropriate\n\nremedies for the disputes submitted to him under Section 9.02; and (3) the Award\n\nwas rationally inferable from the Agreement, as shown by the Arbitrator’s well-\n\nreasoned discussion in the Award.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 25 -\n\f               1.    Section 9.02 gave the Arbitrator authority to decide all\n                     disputes related to the Company Agreement other than\n                     disputes resolved pursuant to Section 9.01, and none of the\n                     disputes the Arbitrator decided were, or could have been,\n                     decided under Section 9.01.\n\n         Appellants have not met their burden to prove the arbitrator acted outside his\n\nauthority. Section 9.02 gave the Arbitrator authority to “any dispute under [the\n\nCompany Agreement] which is not otherwise resolved pursuant to other\n\nprocedures under Section 9.01….” C.R. 128–29 at § 9.02; see also Jack B. Anglin\n\nCo., Inc. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 267–71 (Tex. 1992) (reading a provision\n\nallowing for disputes “under the Contract [to] be submitted to arbitration…”\n\nbroadly and, accordingly, holding arbitration of DTPA claims proper because\n\nDTPA claims were “intertwined” with contract claims) (emphasis added). And\n\nSection 9.01 provided procedures for deciding only three types of disputes: (1)\n\nwho would serve as the party-appointed appraiser for purchasers of a membership\n\ninterest; (2) who would serve as the common appraiser; and (3) which party-\n\nappointed appraiser’s opinion on the Fair Market Value of a membership interest\n\nwould be controlling.       C.R. 127 at § 9.01.     Thus, Section 9.02 granted the\n\nArbitrator authority to decide all other disputes related to the Company\n\nAgreement.\n\n         The controlling opinion on Fair Market Value had been determined under\n\nSection 9.01 prior to the Section 9.02 arbitration that resulted in the Award. See\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                - 26 -\n\fC.R. 128–29 at § 9.02 (establishing the Arbitrator’s broad authority); Appellants’\n\nJoint Brief at 26 (“The Section 9.01 proceeding was concluded on January 3,\n\n2014.”) The Arbitrator then relied on the controlling opinion in issuing the Award.\n\nThe Arbitrator awarded Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest, which\n\nAppellants conceded was $526,796—a valuation taken directly from the\n\ncontrolling Fair Market Value opinion. C.R. 1489. In other words, rather than\n\ninvading the Section 9.01 proceeding, as Appellants erroneously allege, the\n\nArbitrator properly relied on the result of the Section 9.01 proceeding. See id.\n\nAppellants also argue that the Arbitrator awarded a “buyout,” which they allege\n\nwas a Section 9.01 matter. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23. Appellants are incorrect\n\non this point in two respects. First, Appellants claim the award included a buyout\n\n“similar to the old shareholder oppression cases. . . .” Appellants’ Joint Brief at\n\n27. But the Arbitrator did not award a “buyout” as a remedy in tort; rather, the\n\nArbitrator enforced the Company Agreement. Because the Company breached the\n\noption to purchase Dr. Bentz’s interest, the Arbitrator enforced the option by\n\nordering the Company to pay Dr. Bentz the purchase price for his interest, and by\n\nrequiring Dr. Bentz to relinquish that interest. C.R. 1489.\n\n         Second, regardless of whether enforcing the option constitutes a “buyout,”\n\nthe fashioning of remedies is not a Section 9.01 matter. There is no provision in\n\nSection 9.01 for ruling on a party’s cause of action or awarding a party any type of\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 27 -\n\fdamages—those disputes are left to the broad arbitration authority of Section 9.02.\n\nCompare C.R. 128—29 at §9.02 (establishing Section 9.02’s broad arbitration\n\nauthority) with C.R. 127–28 at § 9.01 (carving out from Section 9.02’s broad\n\narbitration authority narrow issues for determination under Section 9.01). Thus,\n\nwhether enforcing the option (or even awarding a supposed “buyout”) was a proper\n\nremedy was a determination to be made in the Section 9.02 proceeding.\n\n         Here, the Arbitrator awarded Dr. Bentz the purchase price for his\n\nmembership interest because the Company breached the Company Agreement\n\nwhen it elected to exercise its option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest\n\nbut then failed to hold a closing and make the payment by the contractually-\n\nmandated deadline. C.R. 1489. Whether the Company breached the Company\n\nAgreement and what the remedy for that breach would be were both issues that\n\ncould not be resolved by the limited procedures of Section 9.01 but instead fell\n\nsquarely within the broad arbitration authority of Section 9.02 that Appellants\n\nagreed to by entering into the Company Agreement.\n\n               2.    The Arbitrator had authority to decide the appropriate\n                     remedies for the disputes submitted to him under\n                     Section 9.02.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority because there\n\nwas “no agreement to award a buyout. . . .”        Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23\n\n(capitalization removed). In supposed support, Appellants claim that Dr. Bentz did\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 28 -\n\fnot plead or submit a request for a “buyout” if he was properly expelled. Id. at 26.\n\nTo begin with, this argument is off-base because the Arbitrator did not award a\n\n“buyout”; he enforced the Company Agreement and awarded Dr. Bentz damages\n\nfor the Company’s breach thereof. C.R. 1489. Further, this argument misses the\n\nmark because: (a) there was no requirement that the parties agree to the remedies\n\nselected by the Arbitrator, and (b) Dr. Bentz did seek to recover the Fair Market\n\nValue of his interest, but regardless, that was an issue for the Arbitrator to decide.\n\n                    a.     There was no requirement that the parties agree to\n                           the remedies selected by the Arbitrator.\n\n         Appellants argue that awarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his\n\ninterest was a “buyout,” and that the Arbitrator could not award this “buyout”\n\nunless the parties agreed to it. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23. As noted above, the\n\nArbitrator did not award a “buyout”; he simply enforced the Company Agreement\n\nand awarded Dr. Bentz damages for the Company’s breach thereof. Appellants’\n\nargument fails regardless because the parties agreed to arbitrate any dispute related\n\nto the Company Agreement (other than a dispute resolved under Section 9.01), and\n\nin doing so, they agreed to subject themselves to Texas arbitration law, which\n\ngives arbitrators “broad discretion in fashioning a remedy appropriate to the case.”\n\nRoe v. Ladymon, 318 S.W.3d 502, 523 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.). Indeed,\n\n“[t]he fact that the relief granted by the arbitrator[] could not or would not be\n\ngranted by a court of law or equity is not a ground for vacating or refusing to\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 29 -\n\fconfirm the award.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 171.090 (West 2015). Thus,\n\nTexas law does not require parties to an arbitration agreement to agree on what\n\nremedies may be granted.\n\n         In supposed support of their argument, Appellants cite Fortune v. Killebrew,\n\nGulf Oil Corp. v. Guidry, and Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co., LP v. San Juan\n\nBasin Royalty Trust. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 24–26. None of these cases are\n\nanalogous to this dispute.\n\n         In Fortune, the arbitration agreement only called for arbitration to\n\n“determine the amount received by each legatee, and the amount that each was\n\nentitled to out of the estate. . . .” 23 S.W. 172, 176 (Tex. 1893). The court held\n\nthat the arbitrators exceeded their authority by awarding transfer of land to the\n\nexecutor, rather than just determining the amount that the executor should have\n\nreceived. Id. at 176–77. In that case, the award of land clearly did not fall under\n\nthe narrow arbitration provision. Id. Here, on the other hand, Section 9.02 is a\n\nbroad arbitration provision under which the Appellants agreed that the Arbitrator\n\nwould decide all disputes related to the Company Agreement that were not\n\nresolved under Section 9.01. See C.R. 128–29 at § 9.02 (providing that “any\n\nDispute under [the Company Agreement] which [was] not otherwise resolved\n\npursuant to other procedures under Section 9.01” would be decided by arbitration\n\nunder Section 9.02).\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 30 -\n\f         In Gulf Oil Corp. v. Guidry, the arbitrators were given very limited\n\nauthority; they were only tasked with determining whether or not an employee was\n\ndischarged for cause. 327 S.W.2d 406 (Tex. 1959). Instead of limiting their\n\ndecision to only that issue, the arbitrators determined that “the discharge was\n\ndiscriminatory; it would be set aside, the employee would be demoted, and would\n\nreceive back pay.” Appellants’ Joint Brief at 25 (citing Guidry, 327 S.W.3d at\n\n141–42). Like the Fortune arbitrators, the Guidry arbitrators received limited\n\nauthority under the arbitration agreement, and their award clearly exceeded that\n\nauthority. But like Fortune, Guidry is not analogous to the dispute before this\n\nCourt because the Company Agreement here gave the Arbitrator broad authority,\n\nwhich he properly exercised.\n\n         Finally, Burlington Resources is also distinguishable. 249 S.W.3d 34 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied). In Burlington Resources, the\n\narbitration agreement at issue applied only to certain existing disputes which were\n\nlisted in an exhibit to the agreement. Id. at 37–38. The court vacated a portion of\n\nthe award because that portion was based on a dispute that was “not mentioned” in\n\nthe agreement. Id. at 45. Here, unlike in Burlington Resources, the arbitration\n\nagreement did not limit arbitration to any specific, then-exiting disputes.\n\nC.R. 128–29 at § 9.02. Thus, none of the cases relied upon by Appellants support\n\ntheir theory.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 31 -\n\f                     b.    Dr. Bentz did seek to recover the Fair Market Value\n                           of his interest, but regardless, this was an issue for the\n                           Arbitrator to decide.\n\n         Appellants attempt to support their argument that there was no agreement to\n\naward Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his membership interest by claiming that\n\nDr. Bentz did not plead or submit a request for a “buyout” in the event the\n\nArbitrator found that Dr. Bentz was properly expelled. Appellants’ Joint Brief at\n\n25–28. However, whether Dr. Bentz pled a claim for breach of contract and sought\n\ndamages in the amount of the already-determined Fair Market Value of his\n\nmembership interest is inapposite, because arbitrations do not follow the same\n\nprocedural rules as court cases.          Instead, “the enforcement of pleading\n\nrequirements before the arbitrator is a procedural matter for the arbitrator.” Kline,\n\n874 S.W.2d at 782 (citing USX Corp. v. West, 781 S.W.2d 453, 456 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ)) (where respondent claimed arbitrators erred in\n\nawarding punitive damages even though claimant had not plead punitive damages,\n\nthe court “defer[red] to the arbitrators with regard to procedural matters such as the\n\nsufficiency of [respondent’s] pleadings”).\n\n         Furthermore, the Arbitrator did in fact rule only on the issues before him,\n\nand the Court must reject Appellants’ claim to the contrary because the Court\n\n“do[es] not have a record of the arbitration and is unable to determine what claims\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 32 -\n\fwere submitted or what evidence was offered before the arbitrator[].”8 Id. at 783.\n\nWithout a complete record of the hearing, the Court has “no way of knowing\n\nwhether a fact issue was raised, or for that matter, whether certain issues were tried\n\nby consent.” Brockman, 2005 WL 2850128, at *4. The Court must therefore\n\nreject Appellants’ argument on this point.\n\n               3.      The Award was rationally inferable from the Agreement, as\n                       shown by the Arbitrator’s well-reasoned discussion in the\n                       Award.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Award failed the “essence” test because, they\n\nclaim, the Award does not “‘have a basis that is at least rationally inferable, if not\n\nobviously drawn from the letter and purpose of the contract.’” Appellants’ Joint\n\nBrief at 28; Executone Info Sys., Inc. v. Davis, 26 F.3d 1314, 1325 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\nIn support of this argument, Appellants assert that the Arbitrator incorrectly\n\ndetermined that Dr. Bentz was a member of the Company after his expulsion. Id.\n\nat 28. Appellants’ position is untenable because: (a) the essence test does not\n\nallow the non-prevailing party to retry the dispute, and, in any event, (b) the\n\n\n\n8\n  In fact, Appellants’ claim that Dr. Bentz did not submit this issue in the arbitration is directly\ncontradicted by a document they did not put into the record. One Section of Dr. Bentz’s\nprehearing brief was entitled, “Even if the Respondents properly expelled Dr. Bentz, they\nhave still breached the Company Agreement[] by failing to pay him Fair Market Value of\nhis Membership Interest.” See Appendix 11, Excerpts from Dr. Bentz’s Prehearing Brief at 39\n(emphasis in original). This brief is not in the appellate record because Appellants failed to\nprovide a complete record to the trial court, but Appellants should not be allowed to benefit from\nthat failure—this is the very reason appellants are required to bring forward complete records of\narbitration proceedings in the first place.\n\n\n54069386.3                                    - 33 -\n\fArbitrator correctly determined that Dr. Bentz was still a member after expulsion\n\nand prior to the sale of his membership interest.\n\n                    a.    The essence test does not allow the non-prevailing\n                          party to retry the dispute.\n\n         Appellants’ essence test argument is yet another attempt to recast their\n\narguments on the merits as jurisdictional arguments. But, as the Executone case\n\ncited by Appellants makes clear, the essence test does not permit courts to retry the\n\nmerits of an arbitration. Rather, in applying the essence test, “[t]he Court looks\n\nonly to the result reached.”     Id. (quoting Anderman/Smith Operating Co. v.\n\nTennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 918 F.2d 1215, 1219 n.3 (5th Cir. 1990)). A “remedy\n\nlies beyond the arbitrator’s jurisdiction only if ‘there is no rational way to explain\n\nthe remedy handed down by the arbitrator as a logical means of furthering the aims\n\nof the contract.’” Id. (quoting Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Central of Ga. Ry.,\n\n415 F.2d 403, 412 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1008 (1970)).              In\n\napplying the essence test, the Court is not “limited to the arbitrator’s explanations\n\nfor his award. . . .” Id. (quoting Anderman/Smith, 918 F.2d at 1219 n.3.).\n\n         In Ancor Holdings, L.L.C. v. Peterson, Goldman & Villani, Inc., another\n\ncase Appellants rely upon, the court further explains the essence test as follows:\n\n              Our inquiry here is not one of contract interpretation.\n              Rather, we look to whether the arbitrator’s award “was so\n              unfounded in reason and fact, so unconnected with the\n              wording and purpose of the [contract] as to ‘manifest an\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 34 -\n\f               infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator’” such that the\n               arbitrator failed to interpret the [contract] at all. . . .\n\n294 S.W.3d 818, 830–31 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.) (emphasis added).\n\nThus, under the essence test, “[e]ven if the arbitrator made a mistake in the\n\napplication of the law. . . such a mistake is not a ground for vacating an arbitrator’s\n\naward.” Id. at 833.\n\n         Here, as in Ancor Holdings, the Award does not “manifest an infidelity” to\n\nthe Arbitrator’s obligations. Like the arbitrator in Ancor Holdings, “it is clear from\n\nthe [A]rbitrator’s. . . final award that [he] went through the process of interpreting\n\nthe [contract] and that [he] considered the wealth of evidence presented to [him].”\n\nId. at 831. Indeed, the Award shows that the Arbitrator issued the Award after\n\n“having read the pleadings, heard the testimony, reviewed the relevant documents,\n\nlistened to argument of counsel, read and considered the briefs and the post-\n\nhearing submissions, after full consideration of the record upon due deliberation,\n\nconstruing the contracts and applying Texas law. . . .”          C.R. 1492.     For these\n\nreasons, the Award passes the essence test.\n\n                      b.    The Arbitrator correctly determined that Dr. Bentz\n                            was still a member after expulsion.\n\n         Even if the essence test allowed a court to review the merits of the\n\nArbitrator’s decision—which it does not—the Award would pass the test because\n\nthe Arbitrator correctly determined that Dr. Bentz was still a member after\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                 - 35 -\n\fexpulsion and prior to the sale of his membership interest.               Dr. Bentz’s\n\nmembership interest was his personal property, and Appellants have pointed to no\n\nevidence that Dr. Bentz had transferred his interest to anyone. See TEX. BUS.\n\nORGS. CODE § 101.106 (West 2015) (“A membership interest in a limited liability\n\ncompany is personal property.”) Further, nothing in the Company Agreement\n\nsuggests that a member stops being a member upon expulsion or that his\n\nmembership interest gets “absorbed.” To the contrary, the Company Agreement\n\nsuggests that a member continues to be a member until his interest is transferred—\n\nwhich, here, did not happen before the arbitration hearing.\n\n         Under the Company Agreement, upon expulsion “the Company and the\n\nother Members shall have an option (but not an obligation) to purchase all of the\n\nMembership Interest owned by such. . . expelled Member. . . at the Fair Market\n\nValue determined as of the last day of the calendar month preceding the date of\n\nthe. . . expulsion of such Member.” C.R. 114 at § 2.05. If the Company or other\n\nMembers exercise this option, they must do so within “180 days following the\n\nexpulsion of [the] Member. . . .” Id. The party exercising the option must pay for\n\nthe Membership Interest “at a closing, held on a business day not more than 30\n\ndays after the time for electing to purchase the interest lapses, all in cash or by\n\ncashier’s check. . . .” C.R. 115 at § 2.08. If there is a dispute over the Fair Market\n\nValue, the deadline for closing is stayed until “the determination has been made by\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 36 -\n\fthe common appraiser as to which opinion is the controlling opinion. . . .”\n\nC.R. 115, 127–28. “At the closing, the selling party shall deliver instruments of\n\nconveyance and assignment of the appropriate amount of the Membership Interest.\n\n. .” and “the purchasers shall pay the purchase price. . .” C.R. at 115 at § 2.08.\n\n“Upon transfer of any membership interest in the Company. . . the items of income\n\nand loss attributable to the Company Rights shall be apportioned between the\n\nassignor and the assignee as of the last day of the month preceding the transfer (the\n\ndeemed transfer date) based on the results of Company operations through that\n\ndeemed transfer date.” C.R. 119 at § 4.03.\n\n         Based on the foregoing provisions, Appellants had a choice regarding\n\nwhether to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest upon expulsion. If they\n\nchose to purchase it, they had to exchange the purchase price for documents\n\nconveying the membership interest at a closing. The Company would continue to\n\nallocate profits and losses to Dr. Bentz until the deemed transfer date.           If\n\nAppellants did not choose to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest, then no\n\ntransfer would occur, and the Dr. Bentz would remain a Member. Under this\n\nscheme, if an expelled member lost his interest immediately upon expulsion (as\n\nAppellants allege), there would be no reason for the Company Agreement to\n\nprovide an option to purchase an expelled member’s interest at all.\n\n         The Arbitrator agreed with this analysis of the Company Agreement:\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 37 -\n\f                  If a Texas limited liability company chooses to alter, in\n                  its company agreement, the statutory rule that a Member\n                  may not be expelled, it must make very clear all of the\n                  consequences of expulsion. In construing such an\n                  agreement no rights or consequences that are not\n                  specifically provided for should be assumed. . . . The\n                  Agreements do not say that a Member’s Interest is\n                  terminated, forfeited or lost upon expulsion. Or that he\n                  shall, from that point, cease to be a Member and his\n                  Sharing Ratio be reduced to zero. Instead Section 2.05 of\n                  the Agreements demonstrates that an expelled Member\n                  retains his Membership Interest. The Company and the\n                  other Members have an option to purchase all of the\n                  Membership Interest owned by the expelled Member. . . .\n                  The existence of the option itself recognizes that the\n                  Membership Interest survives expulsion. . . .\n\n                  Common sense, logic and a careful reading of the\n                  Agreements compel that, until paid for his Interest, a\n                  Member, even an expelled Member, is entitled to his\n                  share of distributions made by the Company.\n\nC.R. 1490.\n\n         Now, for the first time on appeal, Appellants complain that this\n\ninterpretation of the Company Agreement treated Dr. Bentz “as if he was a\n\nMember rather than a Disputed Membership Interest.” Appellants’ Joint Brief at\n\n28–31. To be clear, Dr. Bentz was not a disputed membership interest—he owned\n\none.         Under the Company Agreement, a “disputed membership interest” is a\n\nmembership interest, the Fair Market Value of which is in dispute. See C.R. 1461\n\nat § 9.01(a). Dr. Bentz was therefore not a disputed membership interest—he was\n\nan expelled member who owned a membership interest the Fair Market Value of\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                  - 38 -\n\fwhich was in dispute. An expelled member is still a member and a disputed\n\nmembership interest is still a membership interest.         There is nothing in the\n\nCompany Agreement that suggests a member stops being a member when the Fair\n\nMarket Value of his membership interest is in dispute.           Dr. Bentz therefore\n\nremained a member after expulsion and prior to the transfer of his membership\n\ninterest, and the Arbitrator properly decided this issue.\n\n         C.    The Arbitrator did not award a double recovery, but even if he\n               had, it would not be grounds for vacatur.\n\n         In their second issue, Appellants claim that the Arbitrator violated public\n\npolicy by awarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his membership interest\n\nand his pro rata share of the distributions made while he was still a member.\n\nAppellants’ Joint Brief at 42. Appellants assert that this award violates Texas’s\n\nprohibition on double recoveries. Id. Appellants’ argument fails for two reasons:\n\n(1) double recoveries do not warrant vacatur; and (2) the Arbitrator did not award a\n\ndouble recovery.\n\n               1.    Double recoveries do not warrant vacatur.\n\n         Regardless of whether the award granted a double recovery, double\n\nrecoveries do not warrant vacatur because: (a) prohibiting double recoveries is not\n\nso fundamental a policy that it would outweigh public policy in favor of upholding\n\narbitration awards, and, in any event, (b) violating public policy is not a ground for\n\nvacatur.\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 39 -\n\f                      a.    Prohibiting double recoveries is not so fundamental a\n                            policy that it would outweigh public policy in favor of\n                            upholding arbitration awards.\n\n         Appellants state that “[i]n order for an award to be vacated as a violation of\n\npublic policy, the policy at issue must be a carefully articulated fundamental public\n\npolicy.” Appellants’ Joint Brief at 34 (citing CVN Group, Inc. v. Delgado, 95\n\nS.W.3d 234, 239 (Tex. 2002)). The policy against double recoveries, however, is\n\nnot the kind of carefully articulated, fundamental policy that could outweigh the\n\npublic policy in favor of upholding arbitration awards.\n\n         Although Texas’s prohibition against double recoveries reflects public\n\npolicy—as all law does—Appellants did not and cannot cite any Texas cases\n\nsupporting their claim that the policy against double recoveries is the kind of\n\nfundamental policy for which a violation justifies vacatur. Instead, Appellants\n\nskirt the issue by citing a number of cases reaffirming the notion that double\n\nrecoveries are against Texas public policy. See Appellants’ Joint Brief at 37–39\n\n(citing cases for the proposition that “[t]he policy against double recovery is firmly\n\nrooted in Texas jurisprudence”). But Appellants miss their mark. The question is\n\nnot whether Texas has a firmly-rooted policy against double recoveries, but is\n\ninstead whether the public policy is so fundamental as to require courts to upset the\n\nstrong presumption in favor of arbitration awards.          The answer to the latter\n\nquestion is “no.”\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                - 40 -\n\f         At least two courts of appeals have held that awarding a double recovery in\n\narbitration is not grounds for vacatur. In Black v. Shor, the Corpus Christi Court of\n\nAppeals rejected a non-prevailing party’s bid to vacate an arbitration award on the\n\nbasis that is violated the one satisfaction rule. 443 S.W.3d 154 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 2013, pet. denied) The Black court held that “[a] trial court should\n\nnot overturn an arbitration award rendered after honest consideration given to\n\nclaims and defenses presented to it, no matter how erroneous.” Id. at 168–69 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2013, pet. denied) (citing Xtria L.L.C., 286 S.W.3d at 598);\n\nWerline v. E. Tex. Salt Water Disposal Co., 209 S.W.3d 888, 898 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2006); aff’d 307 S.W.3d 267, 268 (Tex. 2010)). Similarly, in Roe v.\n\nLadymon, the Dallas Court of Appeals rejected Appellants’ argument that an\n\n“award should be modified to eliminate a double recovery of damages,” justifying\n\nits holding on the arbitrator’s “broad discretion in fashioning a remedy appropriate\n\nto the case.” 318 S.W.3d at 523.\n\n         Although Appellants cite several cases analyzing arbitration awards in light\n\nof public policy, these cases do not support Appellants’ argument. In one of the\n\ncases cited by Appellants, CVN Group, Inc., the Supreme Court of Texas rejected a\n\npublic policy attack on an arbitration award, reasoning that the “arbitrator’s mere\n\ndisagreement with a judge does not violate public policy [and] [n]othing in the\n\narbitration proceeding indicate[d] that the arbitrator completely disregarded the\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 41 -\n\f[law].”). 95 S.W.3d at 239. Furthermore, in none of the cases cited by Appellants\n\ndid the court vacate an award on the basis that it granted a double recovery; rather,\n\nthose cases vacated awards that violated the Constitution, were unconscionable,\n\nencouraged criminality, or violated a statute that prohibited unconscionable\n\nconduct. See Lee v. El Paso County, 965 S.W.2d 668 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1998,\n\npet. denied) (affirming vacatur of award that violated Texas Constitution’s\n\nprohibition on “freely giving away [of] public moneys for services previously\n\nrendered…”); Lee v. Daniels & Daniels, 264 S.W.3d 273 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2008, pet. denied) (vacating award that granted lawyer recovery against\n\nclient for fees lawyer incurred in representing himself in securing withdrawal from\n\nongoing litigation because it was unconscionable for a client to pay a lawyer’s fee\n\nfor service performed for the lawyer’s benefit); Smith v. Gladney, 98 S.W.2d 351,\n\n352 (Tex. 1936) (vacating award that enforced gambling agreement); Goodyear\n\nTire & Rubber Co. v. Sanford, 540 S.W.2d 478, 483–84 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1976, no writ) (vacating award that found employer’s action proper in\n\nterminating employee for filing criminal charges against supervisor prior to\n\nexhausting grievance process, because award discouraged disclosure of criminal\n\nactivity and delayed justice); Rapid Settlements, 234 S.W.3d at 793 (affirming\n\ninjunction against confirmation of award that violated statute requiring court\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                             - 42 -\n\fapproval of structured settlement in order to prevent abuses of power against\n\nunsophisticated tort claimants).\n\n         Unlike the public policies addressed in the cases cited by Appellants, the\n\npolicy against double recoveries is not the kind of fundamental policy for which a\n\nviolation warrants vacatur, as the Roe v. Ladymon and Black v. Shor courts\n\nrecognized. For the above reasons, the trial court properly honored the public\n\npolicy in favor of upholding arbitration awards, and this Court should do the same.\n\n                     b.    Violating public policy is not a ground for vacatur\n                           under the Federal Arbitration Act.\n\n         Regardless of whether the Award includes a double recovery, the Award\n\nshould not be vacated because the common law ground for vacatur Appellants\n\nassert is no longer a bar to confirmation.\n\n         Appellants note that the “[t]he United States Supreme Court has determined\n\nthat Sections 10 and 11 of the FAA are exclusive of the common law grounds to\n\nvacate an award.” Id. at n. 17. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has made\n\nclear that common law grounds for vacatur no longer bar confirmation of\n\narbitration awards because the grounds for vacatur under the FAA displace and\n\npreempt common law grounds for vacatur. Hall St. Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.,\n\n522 U.S. 576, 584–89 (2008).        Since that decision, this Court held in Royce\n\nHomes, L.P. v. Bates that, where the FAA applies, state common law grounds for\n\nvacatur (like an award violating public policy) do not apply. 315 S.W.3d 77, 90\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 43 -\n\f(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (“We have already held that the\n\nFAA applies to this case. We conclude that Hall Street forecloses any common-\n\nlaw grounds for vacatur of an arbitration award such as manifest disregard of the\n\nlaw and gross mistake.”); see also Petroleum Analyzer Co. LP v. Olstowski, No.\n\n01-09-00076-CV, 2010 WL 2789016 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no\n\npet.) (“. . . statements that the arbitration panel ‘exceeded its power’ in granting an\n\naward against public policy. . . are statements couched in common law arguments\n\nthat do not provide valid grounds for vacatur of the arbitrators’ award.”) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n         As Appellants admit, both Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and Texas\n\nArbitration Act (“TAA”) apply here. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 13 (“. . . the FAA\n\nand TAA apply concurrently.”). They admit further that “the FAA supplies the\n\nsubstantive rules of the [confirmation] decision.” Id. at 14. Because the FAA\n\nforecloses common law grounds for vacatur like an award violating public policy,\n\nAppellants’ public policy challenge to the Award must fail. Furthermore, the cases\n\nAppellants cite do not change this analysis because they predated this Court’s\n\ncontrolling decision in Royce Homes. Compare Royce Homes, 315 S.W.3d 77\n\n(2010), with CVN Group, 95 S.W.3d 234 (2002), Smith v. Gladney, 98 S.W.2d\n\n352 (1936), Goodyear Tire & Rubber, 540 S.W.2d 478 (1976), Lee v. El Paso\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 44 -\n\fCounty, 965 S.W.2d 668 (1998), Rapid Settlements, 234 S.W.3d 788 (2007), and\n\nLee v. Daniels & Daniels, 264 S.W.3d 273 (2008).\n\n               2.    The Award compensates Dr. Bentz for separate injuries and\n                     therefore does not grant a double recovery.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Award granted Dr. Bentz a double recovery, but a\n\ndouble recovery only occurs “when a plaintiff obtains more than one recovery for\n\nthe same injury.” Waite Hill Services, Inc. v. World Class Metal Works, Inc., 959\n\nS.W.2d 182, 184 (Tex. 1996) (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822\n\nS.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex. 1991)). The damages recovered by Dr. Bentz are not duplicative\n\nbecause they compensate Dr. Bentz for separate injuries: the Company’s failure to\n\npay Dr. Bentz for his membership interest after electing to purchase it and the\n\nIndividual Appellants’ wrongful appropriation of Dr. Bentz’s pro rata share of\n\ndistributions while Dr. Bentz was still a member of the Company.\n\n         Appellants’ argument that Dr. Bentz was awarded distributions twice\n\nignores the fact that the “Fair Market Value” is the required purchase price for\n\nDr. Bentz’s membership interest— not a reflection of damages sustained by\n\nDr. Bentz before the purchase of his membership interest. The purchase price\n\nwould be the same whether the Company distributed $0 or $3.6 million between\n\nthe expulsion and purchase, because that is what the parties agreed to.        See\n\nC.R. 118 at § 4.01 (“At such time as determined by the Executive Committee, Net\n\nCash Flow…shall be distributed to the Members in proportion to their Sharing\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 45 -\n\fRatios.”) (emphasis added); see also C.R. 136 (establishing equal sharing ratios of\n\n20.0% per member).\n\n         In creating the Company Agreement, the Company and the members had a\n\nnumber of options to determine what price would be paid to an expelled member\n\non the date of transfer. They could have agreed that the purchase price would be a\n\nsum certain. They could have agreed that the purchase price would be a multiple\n\nof the profits the Company received in the calendar month preceding the transfer.\n\nThey even could have agreed that there would be no purchase price, and that an\n\nexpelled member’s interest would simply revert to the Company. But they did not.\n\nInstead, they agreed that the purchase price would be the Fair Market Value as\n\ndetermined on the last day of the calendar month preceding the month of the\n\nexpulsion. C.R. 114 at § 2.05.\n\n         By defining the Fair Market Value based on a date preceding expulsion, the\n\nAppellants assumed the risk that the value could increase or decrease dramatically\n\nbetween the date of expulsion and the date of purchase—or even between the date\n\nof valuation and the date of expulsion. And by allowing a member to remain a\n\nmember until the transfer of his membership interest, they agreed that the member\n\nwould receive distributions regardless of the extent to which the purchase price\n\n(that is, Fair Market Value) would have been based on an estimate of those\n\ndistributions.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 46 -\n\f         Thus, it was not a double recovery for the Arbitrator to award Dr. Bentz the\n\ncontractually-mandated purchase price (Fair Market Value) as damages for the\n\nCompany’s breach of contract in addition to his contractually-mandated share of\n\nthe membership distributions.\n\n         D.    Even if the Court were to vacate the Award, it could not order the\n               modification that Appellants request.\n\n         For the first time on appeal, Appellants request to “vacate” the entire Award,\n\nexcept for the Arbitrator’s findings that “Dr. Bentz was properly expelled and there\n\nwas no breach of the [Company] Agreement by the Appellants.” Appellants’ Joint\n\nBrief at 42. There are three problems with this argument. First, the Arbitrator did\n\nnot find that “there was no breach of the [Company] Agreement by the\n\nAppellants.”     Id. The Arbitrator instead explicitly found that the Company’s\n\nfailure to hold a closing and pay Dr. Bentz by the deadline was a breach of the\n\nCompany Agreement. C.R. 1489.\n\n         Second, Appellants request—for the first time on appeal—to modify the\n\nAward in a manner that differs from the modification that they requested the trial\n\ncourt make. See C.R. 1413–44, 1591–94, 1605–23, 1776–80, 1801–07, and 1953–\n\n61. Because Appellants did not present this argument to the trial court, they\n\nwaived this argument on appeal. See, e.g., Kline, 874 S.W.2d at 790–91.\n\n         Third, Appellants request modification of the Award—not total vacatur—\n\nand      the   requested   modification    is      impermissible   under   Texas   law.\n\n\n54069386.3                                - 47 -\n\fSection 171.091(a)(2) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that\n\n“the court shall modify or correct an award if…the arbitrators have made an award\n\nwith respect to a matter not submitted to them and the award may be corrected\n\nwithout affecting the merits of the decision made with respect to the issues that\n\nwere submitted….” As previously explained, the Arbitrator only decided matters\n\nsubmitted to him. This alone renders the requested modification impermissible\n\nunder Section 171.091(a)(2).\n\n         Additionally, Appellants’ requested modifications to the Award are\n\nimpermissible under Section 171.091(a)(2) because modifying the Award would\n\naffect the merits of the Arbitrator’s decision. If a court determines that any portion\n\nof an award is invalid, and the “invalid portion is not severable and distinct so that\n\nthe remaining valid part of the award truly expresses the arbitrator’s judgment,”\n\nthen “the entire award is void.” City of Waco v. Kelly, 309 S.W.3d 536, 551 (Tex.\n\n2010) (citing Guidry, 327 S.W.2d at 409). If a portion of an award is rejected and\n\nany part of the award is to be maintained, “it is indispensable that the part thus\n\nallowed to stand should appear to be in no way affected by the departure from the\n\nsubmission.” Guidry, 327 S.W.2d at 409 (quoting McCormick v. Gray, 54 U.S. 26\n\n(1851)).\n\n         Here, no portion of the Award was invalid, but if the Court were to decide\n\notherwise, it would have to vacate the entire Award because the issues determined\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 48 -\n\fby the Arbitrator were not severable or distinct. Dr. Bentz’s expulsion triggered\n\nAppellants’ option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest and formed the\n\nbasis of Appellants’ claim that Dr. Bentz was no longer entitled to distributions, so\n\nthese issues are factually and legally intertwined. Thus, the Court’s decision here\n\nis all or nothing; it may vacate the entire Award or let the Award stand. And the\n\nCourt should do the latter.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n         For these reasons, Dr. Bentz respectfully requests that the Court deny the\n\nAppellants’ attempt to re-litigate this case, deny the Appellants’ request for\n\nimproper modifications to the Award, and affirm the Judgment confirming the\n\nAward.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 49 -\n\fDated:       July 8, 2015\n\n                            __/s/ Andrew Price____________\n                               Andrew Price\n                               State Bar No. 24002791\n                               andrew.price@nortonrosefulbright.com\n                               Rachel Roosth\n                               State Bar No. 24074322\n                               rachel.roosth@nortonrosefulbright.com\n                               James Hartle\n                               State Bar No. 24082164\n                               jim.hartle@nortonrosefulbright.com\n                            1301 McKinney, Suite 5100\n                            Houston, TX 77010-3095\n                            Telephone: (713) 651-5151\n                            Facsimile: (713) 651-5246\n\n                            Counsel for Appellee Alan Bentz, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                  - 50 -\n\f                           CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n         I hereby certify that this instrument was served upon all counsel of record—\n\nwhose information follows—in compliance with Rule 9.5 of the Texas Rules of\n\nAppellate Procedure on July 8, 2015.\n\nRobert A.

Standard of Review ............................................................................13\n         II.    Applying Texas law: the Award must be upheld ...............................14\n                A.       Without a complete record of the arbitration proceedings,\n                         Appellants cannot overcome the presumption in favor of\n                         upholding the Award................................................................15\n                         1.      The issues decided by the Arbitrator were\n                                 submitted in the arbitration, and without a\n                                 complete record, the trial court had to presume that\n                                 they were submitted .......................................................18\n                         2.      The evidence supported the damages awarded, and\n                                 without a complete record, the trial court had to\n                                 presume that it did .........................................................19\n                         3.      Appellants conceded the value of Dr. Bentz’s\n                                 membership interest, and without a complete\n                                 record, the trial court could not find otherwise ............. 22\n                B.       The Arbitrator properly exercised his broad authority\n                         under Section 9.02 to decide all disputes other than those\n                         decided under Section 9.01 ......................................................24\n                         1.      Section 9.02 gave the Arbitrator authority to\n                                 decide all disputes related to the Company\n                                 Agreement other than disputes resolved pursuant\n                                 to Section 9.01, and none of the disputes the\n                                 Arbitrator decided were, or could have been,\n                                 decided under Section 9.01 ............................................26\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                          - iii -\n\f                          2.       The Arbitrator had authority to decide the\n                                   appropriate remedies for the disputes submitted to\n                                   him under Section 9.02 ..................................................28\n                                   a.       There was no requirement that the parties\n                                            agree to the remedies selected by the\n                                            Arbitrator .............................................................29\n                                   b.       Dr. Bentz did seek to recover the Fair\n                                            Market Value of his interest, but regardless,\n                                            this was an issue for the Arbitrator to decide ...... 32\n                          3.       The Award was rationally inferable from the\n                                   Agreement, as shown by the Arbitrator’s well-\n                                   reasoned discussion in the Award .................................33\n                                   a.       The essence test does not allow the non-\n                                            prevailing party to retry the dispute ....................34\n                                   b.       The Arbitrator correctly determined that\n                                            Dr. Bentz was still a member after expulsion .....35\n                 C.       The Arbitrator did not award a double recovery, but even\n                          if he had, it would not be grounds for vacatur .........................39\n                          1.       Double recoveries do not warrant vacatur .....................39\n                                   a.       Prohibiting double recoveries is not so\n                                            fundamental a policy that it would outweigh\n                                            public policy in favor of upholding\n                                            arbitration awards ................................................40\n                                   b.       Violating public policy is not a ground for\n                                            vacatur under the Federal Arbitration Act .......... 43\n                          2.       The Award compensates Dr. Bentz for separate\n                                   injuries and therefore does not grant a double\n                                   recovery .........................................................................45\n                 D.       Even if the Court were to vacate the Award, it could not\n                          order the modification that Appellants request ........................47\nCONCLUSION .......................................................................................................49\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE ...............................................................................51\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE ......................................................................52\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                             - iv -\n\fAPPENDIX\n    1.

Appellants’ Joint Brief at 1, n. 3. When Dr. Bentz\n\nrefused this low-ball offer, the Individual Appellants made good on their threat and\n\nvoted to expel him. Id. Under the Company Agreement, 2 however, Dr. Bentz\n\nremained a member of the Company until he sold his membership interest.\n\nC.R. 1489.3 After the expulsion vote, the Company elected to exercise its option\n\nunder the Company Agreement to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest, but\n\nthe Company later refused to pay the purchase price, which was Fair Market\n\nValue. Id. The Company also began paying Dr. Bentz’s share of the membership\n\ndistributions to the Individual Appellants instead of Dr. Bentz. Id. at 1490.\n\n\n\n1\n  “The Company” refers to appellants Northwest Houston Emergency Specialists, P.L.L.C.\n(“NHESG”), ESG MD, P.L.L.C., and ESG MLP, L.L.C, collectively. “The Individual\nAppellants” refers to Dr. George Davis, Dr. Levon Vartanian, Dr. Anteneh Roba, and\nDr. Woodrow Dolino, collectively. “Appellants,” as used herein, refers to the Company and the\nIndividual Appellants, collectively.\n2\n  “Company Agreement” refers to the Company Agreements of each of the Company entities,\nwhich are identical except for the name of the entity. See C.R. 112–136 (the Company\nAgreement).\n3\n  The Clerk’s Record is cited herein as “C.R. _________.”\n\n\n54069386.3                                 - ix -\n\f         The parties participated in a 5-day arbitration hearing in August 2014. A\n\ncomplete transcript of the arbitration hearing was not made. At the hearing, and\n\nthrough extensive pre- and post-hearing briefing, Dr. Bentz showed that the\n\nAppellants’ actions constituted breaches of the Company Agreement, conversion,\n\nand breaches of fiduciary duties. C.R. 1489–90. The Arbitrator then issued an\n\narbitration award in Dr. Bentz’s favor (the “Award”). See id. at 1488–92. The\n\nAward granted Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value purchase price of his membership\n\ninterest, his distributions that were wrongfully paid to the Individual Appellants,\n\npre-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees. Id. at 1489–91. The Arbitrator also\n\ndeclared that Dr. Bentz had remained a member of the Company until the date of\n\nthe Award. Id. at 1490.\n\n         Dr. Bentz then moved the trial court to confirm the Award. C.R. 1321–\n\n1325. Unhappy with the Award, Appellants filed motions opposing confirmation\n\nin which they sought to re-litigate the merits of the arbitration. C.R. 1413–1444,\n\n1605–1623. But the Honorable Patricia Kerrigan, Judge of the 190th Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Harris County, Texas, confirmed the Award, denied Appellants’\n\nmotions to vacate the Award, and signed the Judgment in Dr. Bentz’s favor.\n\nC.R. 1794–98. Appellants’ motions for reconsideration of the confirmation were\n\ndenied, and Appellants filed a notice of appeal on March 9, 2015. C.R. 1962–63.\n\nThis appeal follows.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              -x-\n\f               STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n         In this appeal, Appellants ask the Court to ignore Texas’s strong\n\npresumption in favor of arbitration awards and set aside a just arbitration award\n\nrendered by an arbitrator who acted with full authority. Furthermore, Appellants\n\nmisconstrue the Award and ask this Court to rely on an incomplete record in order\n\nto overturn it. Thus, and as shown more fully below, Appellants’ asserted points of\n\nerror run so contrary to Texas law that they do not merit oral argument before the\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                             - xi -\n\f                     STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nIssue 1:       Did the trial court err by Confirming the Award over Appellants’\n\nopposition when:\n\n         (a)   The Arbitrator followed the Company Agreement’s mandate that all\n\n               disputes be arbitrated other than disputes over the narrow issues\n\n               enumerated in Section 9.01?\n\n         (b)   The Arbitrator awarded Dr. Bentz that portion of Dr. Bentz’s\n\n               membership distributions which the Individual Appellants took for\n\n               themselves despite Dr. Bentz’s continuing right to those distributions\n\n               during the time period in which Dr. Bentz continued to own his\n\n               membership interest?\n\nIssue 2:       Did the trial court err by confirming the Award over Appellants’\n\nopposition by awarding damages to Dr. Bentz for the Company’s failure to\n\ncomplete the contractual process to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest and\n\nfor the Company’s payment of Dr. Bentz’s membership distributions to the\n\nIndividual Appellants during that time that Dr. Bentz was still a member of the\n\nCompany?\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - xii -\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n         Dr. Bentz and the Individual Appellants founded the Company, and each had\n\na 20% membership interest. C.R. 112–13, 136. The Company was composed of\n\nthree limited liability companies, and (along with NHESG’s wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, Houston Northwest Emergency Specialists, PLLC), it staffed the\n\nemergency department of Houston Northwest Medical Center. Appellants’ Joint\n\nBrief at 1. Over the years, Dr. Bentz served in various administrative and business\n\ncapacities for the Company, which became quite successful.          See C.R. 1564\n\n(Company income statement showing yearly profits in the millions from 2009 to\n\n2011).\n\n         By mid-2011, however, Dr. Bentz’s relationship with the Individual\n\nAppellants had soured over clashes of personalities, and the Individual Appellants\n\ndecided to oust him. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 1, n. 3. The Appellants offered\n\nDr. Bentz a Hobson’s choice in late 2011: the Company would pay him a mere\n\n$100,000 to buy his membership interest, or the Individual Appellants would vote\n\nto expel Dr. Bentz from the Company. Id. When Dr. Bentz refused this low-ball\n\noffer, the Individual Appellants voted to expel him. Id.\n\n         Under the Company Agreement, however, expulsion did not cause a\n\nmember to automatically lose his membership interest.        C.R. 1489.    Instead,\n\nexpulsion merely triggered the Company’s and the other members’ right—but not\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              -1-\n\fobligation—to force the expelled member to sell his membership interest.\n\nC.R. 1489; see also C.R. 114 at § 2.05 (“…during a period of 180 days following\n\nthe expulsion of a Member, the Company and the other Members shall have an\n\noption (but not an obligation) to purchase all of the Membership Interest owned by\n\nsuch…expelled Member….”).           If the Company or other members elected to\n\nexercise that option, the Company Agreement required instruments conveying the\n\nmembership interest to be exchanged for the purchase price at a closing. C.R. 115\n\nat § 2.08. The purchase price would be “Fair Market Value” as defined in the\n\nCompany Agreement. See id. at § 2.09. There were no provisions for transferring\n\na membership interest in the event the Company or the other members exercised\n\ntheir option to purchase the expelled member’s membership interest then failed to\n\nclose and pay the purchase price.\n\n         After the Individual Appellants voted to expel Dr. Bentz, the Company\n\nelected to exercise its option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest.\n\nAppellants’ Joint Brief at 1. While that process was pending, Dr. Bentz remained a\n\nmember. C.R. 1489–90. During that time, however, the Company did not pay\n\nDr. Bentz his share of membership distributions and instead paid them to the\n\nIndividual Appellants. C.R. 1489. For these reasons, amongst others, Dr. Bentz\n\nfiled for arbitration on November 1, 2012 under the arbitration provision of\n\nSection 9.02 of the Company Agreement, which provided a mechanism for\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -2-\n\fresolving “any Dispute under [the Company Agreement] which [was] not\n\notherwise resolved pursuant to other procedures under Section 9.01.”              See\n\nC.R. 128–29 at § 9.02; see also C.R. 137–153.\n\n         Section 9.02’s broad scope contrasted with the narrow scope of Section 9.01,\n\nwhich only provided procedures to decide limited issues. Compare C.R. 128–29 at\n\n§ 9.02 with C.R. 127–28 at § 9.01. In relevant part, Section 9.01 provided a\n\nprocedure to determine the “controlling opinion” on the Fair Market Value of a\n\nmembership interest. C.R. 127 at § 9.01(a). Per that procedure, Dr. Bentz and the\n\nCompany       each   appointed    appraisers   (the   “party-appointed   appraisers”).\n\nC.R. 1418, 1489. Both party-appointed appraisers then opined on the Fair Market\n\nValue of Dr. Bentz’s membership interest.         C.R. 1418.    The party-appointed\n\nappraisers also appointed a third appraiser (the “common appraiser”), whose sole\n\ntask under Section 9.01 was to determine “which opinion [was] the controlling\n\nopinion . . .” on the Fair Market Value of a membership interest. Id.; C.R. 127–28\n\nat § 9.01. Aside from the selection of the controlling opinion on Fair Market\n\nValue, there were only two other issues that could be decided under Section 9.01:\n\n(1) who would serve as the party-appointed appraiser for the purchasers of a\n\nmembership interest; and (2) who would serve as the common appraiser. See\n\nC.R. 127–28 at § 9.01. Neither of those two issues are relevant in this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -3-\n\f         While the Section 9.01 proceeding to determine the controlling opinion was\n\npending, the Individual Appellants moved to stay the Section 9.02 arbitration,\n\narguing that any Section 9.01 proceeding had to be completed before the\n\narbitration could proceed under Section 9.02. C.R. 102–11. On April 4, 2013, the\n\ntrial court ordered the Section 9.02 arbitration stayed until the Section 9.01\n\nprocedure was completed. C.R. 522–24.\n\n         On January 3, 2014, the common appraiser chose the opinion of the\n\nCompany’s appraiser, Reed Tinsley, as the controlling opinion.                        C.R. 1418.\n\nMr. Tinsley’s opinion was that the Fair Market Value was either $257,969 under\n\nan asset approach, or $526,796 under an income approach. C.R. 1555. With this\n\nopinion chosen as the controlling opinion, the Section 9.01 proceeding was\n\ncomplete.4 No other issues in the dispute were to be decided (or indeed, could be\n\ndecided) under Section 9.01. The path was clear for the Section 9.02 arbitration to\n\ncontinue to resolve all other disputes between the parties.\n\n4\n  Appellants repeatedly state throughout their brief that the Section 9.01 proceeding was\ncompleted. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 11 (“The parties finished the Section 9.01 process and a\n‘Fair Market Value’ was determined. . . .”), 18 (“The determination of the controlling opinion as\nto Fair Market Value by Mr. Mr. Carr concluded the Section 9.01 Fair Market Value process.”),\n20 (“Once the Section 9.01 process was finished, the parties moved to arbitration.”), and 26\n(“The Section 9.01 proceeding was concluded on January 3, 2014.”). It is unclear, then, why\nAppellants suggest at the end of their brief that the Section 9.01 proceeding has not ended. Id. at\n46 (“If the Award against the Company is vacated, the Section 9.01 process remains open until\nthe parties close on the purchase option.”); n.38 (“This appeal must be resolved before the parties\ncan conclude the Section 9.01 process. . . .”). In any event, as described below in Section II.B.1,\nthe common appraiser had, as of the time of the Section 9.02 arbitration, already decided the\nonly issue before him under Section 9.01—that is, which party-appointed appraiser’s opinion\nwas the controlling opinion on Fair Market Value.\n\n\n54069386.3                                     -4-\n\f         After the Section 9.02 arbitration process resumed, the parties engaged in\n\nextensive discovery, deposed seven individuals, and submitted over 100 pages of\n\nprehearing briefing.     C.R. 1324; see also C.R. 1419 (discussing post-hearing\n\nbriefing submitted to the Arbitrator). The hearing was then held from August 19,\n\n2014 through August 22, 2014, and reconvened for a final day on August 29, 2014.\n\nC.R. 1488. At the hearing, the Arbitrator received the testimony of Dr. Bentz, each\n\nof the four Individual Appellants, three non-party witnesses, and three expert\n\nwitnesses. C.R. 1324, 1488. The Individual Appellants elected to have a court\n\nreporter transcribe part of the opening statements and part of Dr. Bentz’s\n\ntestimony, but they declined to have the court reporter transcribe the rest, and no\n\nother party made any record of the hearing.         See C.R. 1782–93 (part of the\n\nincomplete record).       Appellants conceded that the Fair Market Value of\n\nDr. Bentz’s membership interest was $526,796. See C.R. 1489 (“All Parties have\n\nacknowledged… that the appropriate Fair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s\n\nMembership Interest is $526,796.”). Following the arbitration hearing, each party\n\nsubmitted post-hearing briefs to supplement the Parties’ already-extensive\n\nprehearing briefs. Id.\n\n         The Arbitrator then issued the Award on October 15, 2014. C.R. 1488. In\n\nit, the Arbitrator found that “all Parties have acknowledged. . . that the appropriate\n\nFair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s Membership Interests [was] $526,796,” a figure\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -5-\n\fconsistent with the controlling opinion from the Section 9.01 proceedings.\n\nC.R. 1489, 1555. The Arbitrator determined that Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\nthat sum because the Company breached the Company Agreement by electing to\n\nexercise the option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s interest and then failing to pay the\n\npurchase price by the contractual deadline.              C.R. 1489.     The Arbitrator also\n\ndetermined that Dr. Bentz was entitled to his pro rata share of membership\n\ndistributions made while Dr. Bentz remained a member because “[c]ommon sense,\n\nlogic and a careful reading of the Agreements compel that, until paid for his\n\nInterest, a Member, even an expelled Member, is entitled to his share of any\n\ndistributions made by the [Company].” C.R. 1490. Finally, the Arbitrator also\n\nawarded Dr. Bentz pre-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.5 C.R. 1491.\n\n         The trial court later confirmed the Award over Appellants’ objections,\n\nentered the Judgment, and denied Appellants’ motions for reconsideration.\n\nC.R. 1794–98, 1962. Shortly afterward, Appellants sued the law firm and attorney\n\nwho had drafted the Company Agreement, alleging that they committed\n\nmalpractice. C.R. 1942–52. Appellants further alleged that they had already\n\nsatisfied the Judgment—though they had not and have not done so. See C.R. 1950\n\n5\n  Per the Company Agreement, the Arbitrator awarded attorneys’ fees to Dr. Bentz because he\nwas a substantially prevailing party. See C.R. 131 at § 9.03 (“In the event a proceeding under\nthis Article 9 is commenced…the party who prevails or substantially prevails in such proceeding\nshall be entitled to recover . . . all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in\nconnection with the proceeding and on appeal.”); C.R. 1491 (“…Claimant substantially prevailed\nin his claims and is entitled to recover his costs, expenses and reasonable attorney fees.”).\n\n\n54069386.3                                    -6-\n\f(characterizing the award of distributions and attorneys’ fees to Dr. Bentz as\n\n“pecuniary losses” that “Plaintiffs sustained. . . .”); C.R. 1947 (stating that a sum\n\nmentioned earlier in the petition “does not include any portion of the $532,064\n\npaid to Bentz to buy-out his membership share . . . .”) (emphasis added). This\n\nappeal follows.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              -7-\n\f                        SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n         At the crux of this appeal is Appellants’ refusal to recognize that, under\n\nSection 9.02 of the Company Agreement, they agreed to arbitrate “any Dispute\n\nunder [the Company Agreement] which [was] not otherwise resolved pursuant to\n\nother procedures under Section 9.01,” which is exactly what happened when the\n\nparties submitted their dispute to the Arbitrator. In contrast, Section 9.01 provided\n\nmechanisms for the narrow determinations of: (1) who would serve as the party-\n\nappointed appraiser for a purchase of a membership interest, (2) who would serve\n\nas the common appraiser, and (3) which party-appointed appraiser’s opinion would\n\nbe the controlling opinion on the Fair Market Value of a membership interest.\n\nNone of these issues were decided in the Section 9.02 arbitration. Rather, after a\n\nfive-day hearing and over a month of deliberation, the Arbitrator properly\n\ndetermined, amongst other things, that: (1) Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\ndamages from the Company for its failure to buy Dr. Bentz’s membership interest\n\nafter electing to exercise its option to do so; (2) Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\ndamages from the Individual Appellants for their wrongful appropriation of his pro\n\nrata share of membership distributions; and (3) Dr. Bentz was entitled to recover\n\nattorneys’ fees per the Company Agreement because he substantially prevailed in\n\nthe arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -8-\n\f         Appellants would have the Court believe that this dispute was actually about\n\none thing: the propriety of Dr. Bentz’s expulsion from the Company. Although the\n\nparties did dispute the propriety of Dr. Bentz’s expulsion, the parties also disputed\n\nwhat happened to Dr. Bentz’s membership interest if he had been properly\n\nexpelled, and resolving this dispute required interpretation of the Company\n\nAgreement—an issue for arbitration under Section 9.02.           Under the Company\n\nAgreement, a member’s expulsion triggered the Company’s and the other\n\nmembers’ right—but not obligation—to buy the member’s membership interest at\n\nthe Fair Market Value.\n\n         Here, upon Dr. Bentz’s expulsion, the Company elected to exercise their\n\noption to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interests but then refused to complete\n\nthe purchase by paying Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value. And, even though no one\n\nhad paid Dr. Bentz for his membership interest, Appellants claimed that\n\nDr. Bentz’s membership interest had disappeared and that he was no longer\n\nentitled to his share of membership distributions. On the other hand, Dr. Bentz\n\nargued that because his membership interest was his personal property, he\n\ncontinued to own the interest and its attendant membership distribution rights until\n\nhe transferred it.     See TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE § 101.106 (West 2015) (“A\n\nmembership interest in a limited liability company is personal property.”) This is\n\nthe same merits-based dispute that is at issue in this appeal.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               -9-\n\f         The Arbitrator has already decided this dispute, and he agreed with\n\nDr. Bentz’s interpretation of the Company Agreement and Texas law.               The\n\nArbitrator therefore awarded Dr. Bentz the damages he was entitled to: payment\n\nfor his membership interest, his unpaid share of the membership distributions,\n\nattorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest, and costs.\n\n         Because Appellants do not like the Arbitrator’s decision, they now wish to\n\nretry the merits of the dispute.      Knowing that courts defer to arbitrators to\n\ndetermine the merits, however, Appellants have recast their claims in the form of\n\njurisdictional arguments. Appellants claim first that the Arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority because the parties did not agree to grant the Arbitrator the authority to\n\naward Dr. Bentz the recoveries contained in the Award. This argument, however,\n\nignores the fact that, by assenting to the Company Agreement, the Appellants\n\nagreed to resolve these disputes under the broad ambit of Section 9.02, and the trial\n\ncourt properly rejected it.\n\n         Appellants also claim that the Award includes a double recovery and that\n\nTexas’s common law policy against double recoveries is so extraordinary and\n\nfundamental that its violation requires vacatur here. Appellants’ argument fails\n\nbecause, as two other courts of appeals have held, the award of a double recovery\n\ndoes not warrant vacatur. Appellants’ argument also fails because common law\n\ngrounds for vacatur—such as vacating an arbitration award because it violates\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 10 -\n\fpublic policy—are not grounds for vacatur under the Federal Arbitration Act,\n\nwhich applies here. In any event, the Award does not include a double recovery\n\nbecause its different components compensate Dr. Bentz for different injuries.\n\n         Finally, Appellants request to modify the Award so that the Award would:\n\n(1) maintain the only aspect of the Award favorable to Appellants (the Arbitrator’s\n\ndetermination that Dr. Bentz was expelled using the proper procedures); (2)\n\ninclude a determination the Arbitrator never made (that Appellants did not breach\n\nthe Company Agreement); and (3) delete the other components of the Award\n\n(which were unfavorable to Appellants).         These requested modifications are\n\nimpermissible because Appellants did not preserve this argument for appeal, they\n\nwould give Appellants relief they did not request, and they would improperly\n\nsegregate intertwined issues.\n\n         The Arbitrator properly interpreted Texas law and the Company Agreement,\n\nand he acted within his authority in doing so. The trial court accordingly showed\n\ndue deference to the Arbitrator’s well-reasoned decision. This Court should not\n\ndisturb the trial court’s decision, because doing so would not only upset Texas’s\n\nstrong presumption in favor of arbitration awards; it would undo a just Award\n\nrendered with full authority. It has been nearly four years since the Individual\n\nAppellants voted to expel Dr. Bentz, and Dr. Bentz has yet to receive any\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                             - 11 -\n\fcompensation for the harm Appellants inflicted upon him. The Court should reject\n\nAppellants’ latest stalling tactic6 and affirm the Judgment.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  There is a real risk that Appellants’ stalling tactics may prevent Dr. Bentz from obtaining\nsatisfaction of the Award and Judgment. See C.R. 1608 (“The Hospital Contract was the\n[Company’s] sole source of revenue, and the [Company] held little in the way of additional\nassets. On October 31, 2013, during the pendency of the underlying arbitration proceedings, the\nHospital Contract terminated when the Hospital elected not to renew it.

As a remedy for these\n\nsupposed deficiencies, Appellants ask the Court to modify the Award so that the\n\nAward declares that Dr. Bentz was properly expelled and that Appellants did not\n\nbreach the Company Agreement.

This Court is presented with a similar situation;\n\nAppellants provided only a limited record, so the Court must “presume any\n\nremaining evidence supports the Award.” Id. at 685.

Thus,\n\nDr. Bentz was awarded separate damages for the violation of two separate\n\ncontractual rights—his right to the purchase price of his membership interest and\n\nhis right to distributions while he remained a member.\n\n         At the arbitration hearing, Appellants’ own damages expert conceded that\n\nawarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value and his share of distributions would not\n\nbe a double recovery if Dr. Bentz were found to still be a member of the Company\n\nafter expulsion—which is, in fact, what the Arbitrator found. C.R. 1489. This\n\ntestimony is not included in the appellate record because Appellants failed to\n\nprovide the trial court with a complete record. But, without a complete record of\n\nthe hearing, Appellants cannot rebut the presumption that the evidence supported\n\nthe award of Fair Market Value and distributions—and, in fact, it did.\n\n         In an instructive case, CC Williams Construction Co., Inc. v. Rico, the non-\n\nprevailing party sought vacatur on the basis that the arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority and granted a double recovery to the prevailing party, but the non-\n\nprevailing party failed to provide a transcript of the hearing.

The court held:\n\n         The record does not indicate that the [non-prevailing party] provided\n         the trial court with a complete record, i.e., a transcript of the\n         arbitration proceedings. See Williams, 244 S.W.3d at 569 (Finding\n         that the trial court did not err by requiring non-prevailing party to\n\n54069386.3                               - 20 -\n\f         provide a transcript of arbitration proceedings, even when no such\n         transcript was made and the party provided affidavits, exhibits, and an\n         attorney’s testimony regarding what occurred at the arbitration\n         proceeding). The [non-prevailing party’s] grounds for vacatur all\n         depend on the evidence offered and considered by the arbitrator and\n         the manner in which the arbitrator conducted the proceedings, none of\n         which the record contains. . . .

As in CC Williams Construction, however, the\n\nappellant’s failure to provide a record of the arbitration proceedings proved fatal to\n\nits claim for vacatur. Id. at *3. The court explained:\n\n         [B]ecause we have no record of the arbitration proceedings, we cannot\n         determine whether the two entries constitute a double counting, as\n         [the appellant] alleges, or whether the two entries were intentionally\n         included in the calculation of the award based on the evidence\n         submitted to the arbitrator, as [the appellee] argues. Absent a record,\n         we must presume that the record supports the arbitrator’s\n         determination of the proper amount of the award.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 21 -\n\f         Here, as in CC Williams Construction and Mega Builders, Appellants have\n\nnot met their burden to provide a complete record. Accordingly, the Court must\n\npresume that the record that it lacks supports the Award.\n\n               3.    Appellants conceded the value of Dr. Bentz’s membership\n                     interest, and without a complete record, the trial court\n                     could not find otherwise.\n\n         The lack of a complete record requires the Court to reject Appellants’\n\nargument that the Arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding a dispute as to the\n\nFair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s interest. In support of their argument, Appellants\n\ncite seven pages of an unofficial transcript from the opening presentations during\n\nthe first day of the hearing. Appellants’ Brief at 21 (citing C.R. 1787–93). But\n\neven this unofficial transcript demonstrates the Individual Appellants’ willingness\n\nfor the Arbitrator to award Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest as long\n\nas it was within the range decided in the Section 9.01 proceeding:\n\n         Mr. Mussalli: What I think would help us is, you know, if there’s an\n         agreement that, you know, if say let’s allow Mr. Wood to determine –\n         there’s the word determine again – let’s allow Mr. Wood to choose, so\n         to speak, as long as you don’t exceed the higher number.\n\nC.R. 1790 at 74:11–16.\n\n         Appellants’ reliance on arguments presented at the hearing underscores the\n\nvery reason that Texas law imposes a burden upon the non-prevailing party to\n\nbring forth a complete record of the arbitration: the Court cannot review the\n\npropriety of the Arbitrator’s exercise of his powers without a record of what\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 22 -\n\fhappened. Here, the lack of a complete record prevents the Court from reviewing\n\nthe testimony and arguments from the rest of the hearing. And what happened at\n\nthe rest of the hearing is important.\n\n         Over the course of the hearing, Appellants did not argue that $526,796 was\n\nnot the Fair Market Value. Rather, as the Arbitrator stated in the Award, “[a]ll\n\nParties [] acknowledged. . . that the appropriate Fair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s\n\nMembership Interests [was] $526,796.” C.R. 1489. The Court must presume the\n\ntruthfulness of the Arbitrator’s statement. See Turner v. Package Exp., L.P., No.\n\n14-12-00241-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2149786</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 n.8 (Tex.

(because the arbitrator’s award stated that the non-\n\nprevailing party “stated in his Closing Brief that he did not want to pursue any\n\nclaims against [the prevailing party],” and the Closing Brief was not included in\n\nthe appellate record, the court presumed that the Closing Brief supported the\n\narbitrator’s decision).    Therefore, although Appellants now claim that the\n\nArbitrator improperly decided a dispute as to the Fair Market Value of Dr. Bentz’s\n\ninterest, the Award reflects that, by the close of the hearing (at the latest), there\n\nwas no longer a dispute as to the Fair Market Value.

They argue that the Arbitrator did not\n\nhave authority to award Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest and\n\ndistributions because those remedies were barred by Section 9.01. Appellants’\n\nJoint Brief at 21–23. They also argue that there was no agreement to award\n\nDr. Bentz a “buyout.” Id. at 22–27. Finally, they argue that the Award fails the\n\n“essence” test because it was not “rationally inferable” from the agreement. Id. at\n\n28.\n\n         These arguments fail for several reasons: (1) Section 9.02 of the Company\n\nAgreement gave the Arbitrator the authority to decide all disputes related to the\n\nCompany Agreement other than disputes resolved pursuant to Section 9.01, and\n\nnone of the disputes the Arbitrator decided were, or even could have been, decided\n\nunder Section 9.01; (2) the Arbitrator had authority to decide the appropriate\n\nremedies for the disputes submitted to him under Section 9.02; and (3) the Award\n\nwas rationally inferable from the Agreement, as shown by the Arbitrator’s well-\n\nreasoned discussion in the Award.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 25 -\n\f               1.    Section 9.02 gave the Arbitrator authority to decide all\n                     disputes related to the Company Agreement other than\n                     disputes resolved pursuant to Section 9.01, and none of the\n                     disputes the Arbitrator decided were, or could have been,\n                     decided under Section 9.01.\n\n         Appellants have not met their burden to prove the arbitrator acted outside his\n\nauthority. Section 9.02 gave the Arbitrator authority to “any dispute under [the\n\nCompany Agreement] which is not otherwise resolved pursuant to other\n\nprocedures under Section 9.01….” C.R. 128–29 at § 9.02; see also Jack B.

And\n\nSection 9.01 provided procedures for deciding only three types of disputes: (1)\n\nwho would serve as the party-appointed appraiser for purchasers of a membership\n\ninterest; (2) who would serve as the common appraiser; and (3) which party-\n\nappointed appraiser’s opinion on the Fair Market Value of a membership interest\n\nwould be controlling.       C.R. 127 at § 9.01.     Thus, Section 9.02 granted the\n\nArbitrator authority to decide all other disputes related to the Company\n\nAgreement.\n\n         The controlling opinion on Fair Market Value had been determined under\n\nSection 9.01 prior to the Section 9.02 arbitration that resulted in the Award. See\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                - 26 -\n\fC.R. 128–29 at § 9.02 (establishing the Arbitrator’s broad authority); Appellants’\n\nJoint Brief at 26 (“The Section 9.01 proceeding was concluded on January 3,\n\n2014.”) The Arbitrator then relied on the controlling opinion in issuing the Award.\n\nThe Arbitrator awarded Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his interest, which\n\nAppellants conceded was $526,796—a valuation taken directly from the\n\ncontrolling Fair Market Value opinion. C.R. 1489. In other words, rather than\n\ninvading the Section 9.01 proceeding, as Appellants erroneously allege, the\n\nArbitrator properly relied on the result of the Section 9.01 proceeding. See id.\n\nAppellants also argue that the Arbitrator awarded a “buyout,” which they allege\n\nwas a Section 9.01 matter. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23. Appellants are incorrect\n\non this point in two respects. First, Appellants claim the award included a buyout\n\n“similar to the old shareholder oppression cases. . . .” Appellants’ Joint Brief at\n\n27. But the Arbitrator did not award a “buyout” as a remedy in tort; rather, the\n\nArbitrator enforced the Company Agreement. Because the Company breached the\n\noption to purchase Dr. Bentz’s interest, the Arbitrator enforced the option by\n\nordering the Company to pay Dr. Bentz the purchase price for his interest, and by\n\nrequiring Dr. Bentz to relinquish that interest. C.R. 1489.\n\n         Second, regardless of whether enforcing the option constitutes a “buyout,”\n\nthe fashioning of remedies is not a Section 9.01 matter. There is no provision in\n\nSection 9.01 for ruling on a party’s cause of action or awarding a party any type of\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 27 -\n\fdamages—those disputes are left to the broad arbitration authority of Section 9.02.\n\nCompare C.R. 128—29 at §9.02 (establishing Section 9.02’s broad arbitration\n\nauthority) with C.R. 127–28 at § 9.01 (carving out from Section 9.02’s broad\n\narbitration authority narrow issues for determination under Section 9.01). Thus,\n\nwhether enforcing the option (or even awarding a supposed “buyout”) was a proper\n\nremedy was a determination to be made in the Section 9.02 proceeding.\n\n         Here, the Arbitrator awarded Dr. Bentz the purchase price for his\n\nmembership interest because the Company breached the Company Agreement\n\nwhen it elected to exercise its option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest\n\nbut then failed to hold a closing and make the payment by the contractually-\n\nmandated deadline. C.R. 1489. Whether the Company breached the Company\n\nAgreement and what the remedy for that breach would be were both issues that\n\ncould not be resolved by the limited procedures of Section 9.01 but instead fell\n\nsquarely within the broad arbitration authority of Section 9.02 that Appellants\n\nagreed to by entering into the Company Agreement.\n\n               2.    The Arbitrator had authority to decide the appropriate\n                     remedies for the disputes submitted to him under\n                     Section 9.02.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority because there\n\nwas “no agreement to award a buyout. . . .”        Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23\n\n(capitalization removed). In supposed support, Appellants claim that Dr. Bentz did\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 28 -\n\fnot plead or submit a request for a “buyout” if he was properly expelled. Id. at 26.\n\nTo begin with, this argument is off-base because the Arbitrator did not award a\n\n“buyout”; he enforced the Company Agreement and awarded Dr. Bentz damages\n\nfor the Company’s breach thereof. C.R. 1489. Further, this argument misses the\n\nmark because: (a) there was no requirement that the parties agree to the remedies\n\nselected by the Arbitrator, and (b) Dr. Bentz did seek to recover the Fair Market\n\nValue of his interest, but regardless, that was an issue for the Arbitrator to decide.\n\n                    a.     There was no requirement that the parties agree to\n                           the remedies selected by the Arbitrator.\n\n         Appellants argue that awarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his\n\ninterest was a “buyout,” and that the Arbitrator could not award this “buyout”\n\nunless the parties agreed to it. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 23. As noted above, the\n\nArbitrator did not award a “buyout”; he simply enforced the Company Agreement\n\nand awarded Dr. Bentz damages for the Company’s breach thereof. Appellants’\n\nargument fails regardless because the parties agreed to arbitrate any dispute related\n\nto the Company Agreement (other than a dispute resolved under Section 9.01), and\n\nin doing so, they agreed to subject themselves to Texas arbitration law, which\n\ngives arbitrators “broad discretion in fashioning a remedy appropriate to the case.”\n\nRoe v.

None of these cases are\n\nanalogous to this dispute.\n\n         In Fortune, the arbitration agreement only called for arbitration to\n\n“determine the amount received by each legatee, and the amount that each was\n\nentitled to out of the estate. . . .” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (Tex. 1893).

Id. at 176–77. In that case, the award of land clearly did not fall under\n\nthe narrow arbitration provision. Id. Here, on the other hand, Section 9.02 is a\n\nbroad arbitration provision under which the Appellants agreed that the Arbitrator\n\nwould decide all disputes related to the Company Agreement that were not\n\nresolved under Section 9.01. See C.R. 128–29 at § 9.02 (providing that “any\n\nDispute under [the Company Agreement] which [was] not otherwise resolved\n\npursuant to other procedures under Section 9.01” would be decided by arbitration\n\nunder Section 9.02).\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 30 -\n\f         In Gulf Oil Corp. v.

Like the Fortune arbitrators, the Guidry arbitrators received limited\n\nauthority under the arbitration agreement, and their award clearly exceeded that\n\nauthority. But like Fortune, Guidry is not analogous to the dispute before this\n\nCourt because the Company Agreement here gave the Arbitrator broad authority,\n\nwhich he properly exercised.\n\n         Finally, Burlington Resources is also distinguishable. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449252\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449252/burlington-res-oil-v-san-juan-basin-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).

This brief is not in the appellate record because Appellants failed to\nprovide a complete record to the trial court, but Appellants should not be allowed to benefit from\nthat failure—this is the very reason appellants are required to bring forward complete records of\narbitration proceedings in the first place.\n\n\n54069386.3                                    - 33 -\n\fArbitrator correctly determined that Dr. Bentz was still a member after expulsion\n\nand prior to the sale of his membership interest.\n\n                    a.

But, as the Executone case\n\ncited by Appellants makes clear, the essence test does not permit courts to retry the\n\nmerits of an arbitration.

App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.) (emphasis added).\n\nThus, under the essence test, “[e]ven if the arbitrator made a mistake in the\n\napplication of the law. . . such a mistake is not a ground for vacating an arbitrator’s\n\naward.” Id. at 833.\n\n         Here, as in Ancor Holdings, the Award does not “manifest an infidelity” to\n\nthe Arbitrator’s obligations. Like the arbitrator in Ancor Holdings, “it is clear from\n\nthe [A]rbitrator’s. . . final award that [he] went through the process of interpreting\n\nthe [contract] and that [he] considered the wealth of evidence presented to [him].”\n\nId. at 831. Indeed, the Award shows that the Arbitrator issued the Award after\n\n“having read the pleadings, heard the testimony, reviewed the relevant documents,\n\nlistened to argument of counsel, read and considered the briefs and the post-\n\nhearing submissions, after full consideration of the record upon due deliberation,\n\nconstruing the contracts and applying Texas law. . . .”          C.R. 1492.     For these\n\nreasons, the Award passes the essence test.\n\n                      b.    The Arbitrator correctly determined that Dr. Bentz\n                            was still a member after expulsion.\n\n         Even if the essence test allowed a court to review the merits of the\n\nArbitrator’s decision—which it does not—the Award would pass the test because\n\nthe Arbitrator correctly determined that Dr. Bentz was still a member after\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                 - 35 -\n\fexpulsion and prior to the sale of his membership interest.               Dr. Bentz’s\n\nmembership interest was his personal property, and Appellants have pointed to no\n\nevidence that Dr. Bentz had transferred his interest to anyone. See TEX. BUS.\n\nORGS. CODE § 101.106 (West 2015) (“A membership interest in a limited liability\n\ncompany is personal property.”) Further, nothing in the Company Agreement\n\nsuggests that a member stops being a member upon expulsion or that his\n\nmembership interest gets “absorbed.” To the contrary, the Company Agreement\n\nsuggests that a member continues to be a member until his interest is transferred—\n\nwhich, here, did not happen before the arbitration hearing.\n\n         Under the Company Agreement, upon expulsion “the Company and the\n\nother Members shall have an option (but not an obligation) to purchase all of the\n\nMembership Interest owned by such. . . expelled Member. . . at the Fair Market\n\nValue determined as of the last day of the calendar month preceding the date of\n\nthe. . . expulsion of such Member.” C.R. 114 at § 2.05. If the Company or other\n\nMembers exercise this option, they must do so within “180 days following the\n\nexpulsion of [the] Member. . . .” Id. The party exercising the option must pay for\n\nthe Membership Interest “at a closing, held on a business day not more than 30\n\ndays after the time for electing to purchase the interest lapses, all in cash or by\n\ncashier’s check. . . .” C.R. 115 at § 2.08. If there is a dispute over the Fair Market\n\nValue, the deadline for closing is stayed until “the determination has been made by\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 36 -\n\fthe common appraiser as to which opinion is the controlling opinion. . . .”\n\nC.R. 115, 127–28. “At the closing, the selling party shall deliver instruments of\n\nconveyance and assignment of the appropriate amount of the Membership Interest.\n\n. .” and “the purchasers shall pay the purchase price. . .” C.R. at 115 at § 2.08.\n\n“Upon transfer of any membership interest in the Company. . . the items of income\n\nand loss attributable to the Company Rights shall be apportioned between the\n\nassignor and the assignee as of the last day of the month preceding the transfer (the\n\ndeemed transfer date) based on the results of Company operations through that\n\ndeemed transfer date.” C.R. 119 at § 4.03.\n\n         Based on the foregoing provisions, Appellants had a choice regarding\n\nwhether to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest upon expulsion. If they\n\nchose to purchase it, they had to exchange the purchase price for documents\n\nconveying the membership interest at a closing. The Company would continue to\n\nallocate profits and losses to Dr. Bentz until the deemed transfer date.           If\n\nAppellants did not choose to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest, then no\n\ntransfer would occur, and the Dr. Bentz would remain a Member. Under this\n\nscheme, if an expelled member lost his interest immediately upon expulsion (as\n\nAppellants allege), there would be no reason for the Company Agreement to\n\nprovide an option to purchase an expelled member’s interest at all.\n\n         The Arbitrator agreed with this analysis of the Company Agreement:\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 37 -\n\f                  If a Texas limited liability company chooses to alter, in\n                  its company agreement, the statutory rule that a Member\n                  may not be expelled, it must make very clear all of the\n                  consequences of expulsion. In construing such an\n                  agreement no rights or consequences that are not\n                  specifically provided for should be assumed. . . . The\n                  Agreements do not say that a Member’s Interest is\n                  terminated, forfeited or lost upon expulsion. Or that he\n                  shall, from that point, cease to be a Member and his\n                  Sharing Ratio be reduced to zero. Instead Section 2.05 of\n                  the Agreements demonstrates that an expelled Member\n                  retains his Membership Interest. The Company and the\n                  other Members have an option to purchase all of the\n                  Membership Interest owned by the expelled Member. . . .\n                  The existence of the option itself recognizes that the\n                  Membership Interest survives expulsion. . . .\n\n                  Common sense, logic and a careful reading of the\n                  Agreements compel that, until paid for his Interest, a\n                  Member, even an expelled Member, is entitled to his\n                  share of distributions made by the Company.\n\nC.R. 1490.\n\n         Now, for the first time on appeal, Appellants complain that this\n\ninterpretation of the Company Agreement treated Dr. Bentz “as if he was a\n\nMember rather than a Disputed Membership Interest.” Appellants’ Joint Brief at\n\n28–31. To be clear, Dr. Bentz was not a disputed membership interest—he owned\n\none.         Under the Company Agreement, a “disputed membership interest” is a\n\nmembership interest, the Fair Market Value of which is in dispute. See C.R. 1461\n\nat § 9.01(a). Dr. Bentz was therefore not a disputed membership interest—he was\n\nan expelled member who owned a membership interest the Fair Market Value of\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                  - 38 -\n\fwhich was in dispute. An expelled member is still a member and a disputed\n\nmembership interest is still a membership interest.         There is nothing in the\n\nCompany Agreement that suggests a member stops being a member when the Fair\n\nMarket Value of his membership interest is in dispute.           Dr. Bentz therefore\n\nremained a member after expulsion and prior to the transfer of his membership\n\ninterest, and the Arbitrator properly decided this issue.\n\n         C.    The Arbitrator did not award a double recovery, but even if he\n               had, it would not be grounds for vacatur.\n\n         In their second issue, Appellants claim that the Arbitrator violated public\n\npolicy by awarding Dr. Bentz the Fair Market Value of his membership interest\n\nand his pro rata share of the distributions made while he was still a member.\n\nAppellants’ Joint Brief at 42. Appellants assert that this award violates Texas’s\n\nprohibition on double recoveries. Id. Appellants’ argument fails for two reasons:\n\n(1) double recoveries do not warrant vacatur; and (2) the Arbitrator did not award a\n\ndouble recovery.\n\n               1.    Double recoveries do not warrant vacatur.\n\n         Regardless of whether the award granted a double recovery, double\n\nrecoveries do not warrant vacatur because: (a) prohibiting double recoveries is not\n\nso fundamental a policy that it would outweigh public policy in favor of upholding\n\narbitration awards, and, in any event, (b) violating public policy is not a ground for\n\nvacatur.\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 39 -\n\f                      a.    Prohibiting double recoveries is not so fundamental a\n                            policy that it would outweigh public policy in favor of\n                            upholding arbitration awards.\n\n         Appellants state that “[i]n order for an award to be vacated as a violation of\n\npublic policy, the policy at issue must be a carefully articulated fundamental public\n\npolicy.” Appellants’ Joint Brief at 34 (citing CVN Group, Inc. v. Delgado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2332835\"><a href=\"/opinion/2332835/cvn-group-inc-v-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (Tex. 2002)). The policy against double recoveries, however, is\n\nnot the kind of carefully articulated, fundamental policy that could outweigh the\n\npublic policy in favor of upholding arbitration awards.\n\n         Although Texas’s prohibition against double recoveries reflects public\n\npolicy—as all law does—Appellants did not and cannot cite any Texas cases\n\nsupporting their claim that the policy against double recoveries is the kind of\n\nfundamental policy for which a violation justifies vacatur. Instead, Appellants\n\nskirt the issue by citing a number of cases reaffirming the notion that double\n\nrecoveries are against Texas public policy. See Appellants’ Joint Brief at 37–39\n\n(citing cases for the proposition that “[t]he policy against double recovery is firmly\n\nrooted in Texas jurisprudence”). But Appellants miss their mark. The question is\n\nnot whether Texas has a firmly-rooted policy against double recoveries, but is\n\ninstead whether the public policy is so fundamental as to require courts to upset the\n\nstrong presumption in favor of arbitration awards.          The answer to the latter\n\nquestion is “no.”\n\n\n\n54069386.3                                - 40 -\n\f         At least two courts of appeals have held that awarding a double recovery in\n\narbitration is not grounds for vacatur. In Black v.

In one of the\n\ncases cited by Appellants, CVN Group, Inc., the Supreme Court of Texas rejected a\n\npublic policy attack on an arbitration award, reasoning that the “arbitrator’s mere\n\ndisagreement with a judge does not violate public policy [and] [n]othing in the\n\narbitration proceeding indicate[d] that the arbitrator completely disregarded the\n\n\n\n54069386.3                               - 41 -\n\f[law].”). 95 S.W.3d at 239.

(“. . . statements that the arbitration panel ‘exceeded its power’ in granting an\n\naward against public policy. . . are statements couched in common law arguments\n\nthat do not provide valid grounds for vacatur of the arbitrators’ award.”) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n         As Appellants admit, both Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and Texas\n\nArbitration Act (“TAA”) apply here. Appellants’ Joint Brief at 13 (“. . . the FAA\n\nand TAA apply concurrently.”). They admit further that “the FAA supplies the\n\nsubstantive rules of the [confirmation] decision.” Id. at 14. Because the FAA\n\nforecloses common law grounds for vacatur like an award violating public policy,\n\nAppellants’ public policy challenge to the Award must fail. Furthermore, the cases\n\nAppellants cite do not change this analysis because they predated this Court’s\n\ncontrolling decision in Royce Homes.

The Award compensates Dr. Bentz for separate injuries and\n                     therefore does not grant a double recovery.\n\n         Appellants claim that the Award granted Dr. Bentz a double recovery, but a\n\ndouble recovery only occurs “when a plaintiff obtains more than one recovery for\n\nthe same injury.” Waite Hill Services, Inc. v. World Class Metal Works, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (Tex. 1996) (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (Tex. 1991)). The damages recovered by Dr. Bentz are not duplicative\n\nbecause they compensate Dr. Bentz for separate injuries: the Company’s failure to\n\npay Dr. Bentz for his membership interest after electing to purchase it and the\n\nIndividual Appellants’ wrongful appropriation of Dr. Bentz’s pro rata share of\n\ndistributions while Dr. Bentz was still a member of the Company.\n\n         Appellants’ argument that Dr. Bentz was awarded distributions twice\n\nignores the fact that the “Fair Market Value” is the required purchase price for\n\nDr. Bentz’s membership interest— not a reflection of damages sustained by\n\nDr. Bentz before the purchase of his membership interest. The purchase price\n\nwould be the same whether the Company distributed $0 or $3.6 million between\n\nthe expulsion and purchase, because that is what the parties agreed to.        See\n\nC.R. 118 at § 4.01 (“At such time as determined by the Executive Committee, Net\n\nCash Flow…shall be distributed to the Members in proportion to their Sharing\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 45 -\n\fRatios.”) (emphasis added); see also C.R. 136 (establishing equal sharing ratios of\n\n20.0% per member).\n\n         In creating the Company Agreement, the Company and the members had a\n\nnumber of options to determine what price would be paid to an expelled member\n\non the date of transfer. They could have agreed that the purchase price would be a\n\nsum certain. They could have agreed that the purchase price would be a multiple\n\nof the profits the Company received in the calendar month preceding the transfer.\n\nThey even could have agreed that there would be no purchase price, and that an\n\nexpelled member’s interest would simply revert to the Company. But they did not.\n\nInstead, they agreed that the purchase price would be the Fair Market Value as\n\ndetermined on the last day of the calendar month preceding the month of the\n\nexpulsion. C.R. 114 at § 2.05.\n\n         By defining the Fair Market Value based on a date preceding expulsion, the\n\nAppellants assumed the risk that the value could increase or decrease dramatically\n\nbetween the date of expulsion and the date of purchase—or even between the date\n\nof valuation and the date of expulsion. And by allowing a member to remain a\n\nmember until the transfer of his membership interest, they agreed that the member\n\nwould receive distributions regardless of the extent to which the purchase price\n\n(that is, Fair Market Value) would have been based on an estimate of those\n\ndistributions.\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 46 -\n\f         Thus, it was not a double recovery for the Arbitrator to award Dr. Bentz the\n\ncontractually-mandated purchase price (Fair Market Value) as damages for the\n\nCompany’s breach of contract in addition to his contractually-mandated share of\n\nthe membership distributions.\n\n         D.    Even if the Court were to vacate the Award, it could not order the\n               modification that Appellants request.\n\n         For the first time on appeal, Appellants request to “vacate” the entire Award,\n\nexcept for the Arbitrator’s findings that “Dr. Bentz was properly expelled and there\n\nwas no breach of the [Company] Agreement by the Appellants.” Appellants’ Joint\n\nBrief at 42. There are three problems with this argument. First, the Arbitrator did\n\nnot find that “there was no breach of the [Company] Agreement by the\n\nAppellants.”     Id. The Arbitrator instead explicitly found that the Company’s\n\nfailure to hold a closing and pay Dr. Bentz by the deadline was a breach of the\n\nCompany Agreement. C.R. 1489.\n\n         Second, Appellants request—for the first time on appeal—to modify the\n\nAward in a manner that differs from the modification that they requested the trial\n\ncourt make. See C.R. 1413–44, 1591–94, 1605–23, 1776–80, 1801–07, and 1953–\n\n61. Because Appellants did not present this argument to the trial court, they\n\nwaived this argument on appeal. See, e.g., Kline, 874 S.W.2d at 790–91.\n\n         Third, Appellants request modification of the Award—not total vacatur—\n\nand      the   requested   modification    is      impermissible   under   Texas   law.\n\n\n54069386.3                                - 47 -\n\fSection 171.091(a)(2) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that\n\n“the court shall modify or correct an award if…the arbitrators have made an award\n\nwith respect to a matter not submitted to them and the award may be corrected\n\nwithout affecting the merits of the decision made with respect to the issues that\n\nwere submitted….” As previously explained, the Arbitrator only decided matters\n\nsubmitted to him. This alone renders the requested modification impermissible\n\nunder Section 171.091(a)(2).\n\n         Additionally, Appellants’ requested modifications to the Award are\n\nimpermissible under Section 171.091(a)(2) because modifying the Award would\n\naffect the merits of the Arbitrator’s decision. If a court determines that any portion\n\nof an award is invalid, and the “invalid portion is not severable and distinct so that\n\nthe remaining valid part of the award truly expresses the arbitrator’s judgment,”\n\nthen “the entire award is void.” City of Waco v. Kelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895199\"><a href=\"/opinion/895199/city-of-waco-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (Tex.\n\n2010) (citing Guidry, 327 S.W.2d at 409). If a portion of an award is rejected and\n\nany part of the award is to be maintained, “it is indispensable that the part thus\n\nallowed to stand should appear to be in no way affected by the departure from the\n\nsubmission.” Guidry, 327 S.W.2d at 409 (quoting McCormick v. Gray, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1851)).\n\n         Here, no portion of the Award was invalid, but if the Court were to decide\n\notherwise, it would have to vacate the entire Award because the issues determined\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 48 -\n\fby the Arbitrator were not severable or distinct. Dr. Bentz’s expulsion triggered\n\nAppellants’ option to purchase Dr. Bentz’s membership interest and formed the\n\nbasis of Appellants’ claim that Dr. Bentz was no longer entitled to distributions, so\n\nthese issues are factually and legally intertwined. Thus, the Court’s decision here\n\nis all or nothing; it may vacate the entire Award or let the Award stand. And the\n\nCourt should do the latter.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n         For these reasons, Dr. Bentz respectfully requests that the Court deny the\n\nAppellants’ attempt to re-litigate this case, deny the Appellants’ request for\n\nimproper modifications to the Award, and affirm the Judgment confirming the\n\nAward.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                              - 49 -\n\fDated:       July 8, 2015\n\n                            __/s/ Andrew Price____________\n                               Andrew Price\n                               State Bar No. 24002791\n                               andrew.price@nortonrosefulbright.com\n                               Rachel Roosth\n                               State Bar No. 24074322\n                               rachel.roosth@nortonrosefulbright.com\n                               James Hartle\n                               State Bar No. 24082164\n                               jim.hartle@nortonrosefulbright.com\n                            1301 McKinney, Suite 5100\n                            Houston, TX 77010-3095\n                            Telephone: (713) 651-5151\n                            Facsimile: (713) 651-5246\n\n                            Counsel for Appellee Alan Bentz, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n54069386.3                  - 50 -\n\f                           CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n         I hereby certify that this instrument was served upon all counsel of record—\n\nwhose information follows—in compliance with Rule 9.5 of the Texas Rules of\n\nAppellate Procedure on July 8, 2015.\n\nRobert A.
