STATE’S WRIT SUSTAINED; HARKINS’S WRIT\n\nANNULLED; CASE REMANDED.\n\n\n\n       Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Jennifer M. York,\n\nAssistant Attorney General, for the State of Iowa.\n\n\n\n       Robert Harkins, Mount Pleasant, pro se.\n\f                                    2\n\nMANSFIELD, Justice.\n\n      The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides,\n\n“No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness\n\nagainst himself.”   According to section 903A.2(1)(a) (2007) of the Iowa\n\nCode, an incarcerated sex offender is not eligible for an earned-time\n\nreduction of sentence unless that person completes a sex offender\n\ntreatment program.      The question presented here is whether section\n\n903A.2(1)(a) violates the Fifth Amendment rights of a convicted sex\n\noffender, when successful completion of the treatment program would\n\nrequire him to acknowledge responsibility for his offense.\n\n      We conclude there is no Fifth Amendment violation.           For the\n\nreasons discussed herein, we believe the State of Iowa may use earned-\n\ntime credits as an incentive for convicted sex offenders to obtain sex\n\noffender   treatment,    even   when     the   treatment     requires   an\n\nacknowledgment of responsibility.\n\n      I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      On March 21, 2006, Robert Harkins was convicted of third-degree\n\nsexual abuse following a jury trial. The court of appeals, in upholding\n\nHarkins’s conviction on direct appeal, summarized the relevant facts as\n\nfollows:\n             On August 27, 2005, Robert Harkins went out\n      drinking with some friends. The group ended up at the\n      home of [the victim]. After a short period of time most of the\n      group left, except for Derrick, Trisha, Harkins, and [the\n      victim]. Derrick, who was [the victim’s] former boyfriend,\n      passed out on the couch. Trisha went to sleep in one of the\n      bedrooms. Harkins laid down in [the victim’s] bedroom in all\n      of his clothes. [The victim] stated she believed Harkins was\n      sleeping or passed out, so she laid down to sleep on the\n      other side of the bed.\n            [The victim] testified Harkins rolled over on top of her,\n      and she told him to get off. Harkins pinned [the victim]\n      down and pulled her clothing off. [The victim] testified she\n      repeatedly told Harkins no, stating, “I told him no. I told\n\f                                     3\n      him to stop.”     Harkins proceeded to engage in sexual\n      intercourse with her. When Harkins stopped she kneed him\n      and pushed him off, then screamed at him that she had said\n      no. Trisha heard [the victim] say, “No, I said no.” Trisha\n      went to investigate, and met [the victim] coming out of her\n      bedroom, clad only in a blanket and crying hysterically.\n      Trisha stated she saw blood on [the victim’s] bed. Harkins\n      then left the home.\n             Trisha and [the victim] called the police, and deputy\n      sheriff Kevin Knoche responded to the call. Deputy Knoche\n      also saw blood on [the victim’s] bed. Deputy Knoche found\n      Harkins sleeping at the home of a friend. Harkins was not\n      wearing his underwear, but it was stuck in the fly of his\n      pants. Harkins denied having sex with [the victim] and\n      stated he could not recall anything like that occurring.\n              [The victim] was taken to a hospital for a physical\n      examination.      [The victim] had three tears, which were\n      bleeding, in the area of the perineum. Nancy Downing, a\n      registered nurse, testified she did not usually find tears that\n      were that large or bleeding at the time of the exam. Downing\n      testified [the victim’s] injuries were consistent with forced\n      sexual intercourse.\n             Harkins was charged with third-degree sexual abuse,\n      in violation of Iowa Code section 709.4 (2005). At the trial\n      Harkins testified he remembered everything about the\n      evening in question. He stated he and [the victim] had\n      engaged in consensual sex. He stated that in the middle of\n      having sex, he found out [the victim] had recently had sex\n      with Derrick, and he made a derogatory comment to her. He\n      stated [the victim] got mad and threw him out.\n            A jury found Harkins guilty of third-degree sexual\n      abuse. Harkins was sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n      not to exceed ten years.\n\nState v. Harkins, No. 06–0660, 2007 WL 914032 (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 28,\n\n2007).\n\n      After the court of appeals affirmed Harkins’s conviction, the district\n\ncourt imposed a special life sentence on Harkins pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 903B.1 (Supp. 2005), in addition to the original ten-year term of\n\nimprisonment. Harkins appealed the special sentence, asserting it was\n\nunconstitutional and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object\n\nto it. On July 22, 2009, the court of appeals rejected these arguments\n\f                                       4\n\nand again affirmed the district court. State v. Harkins, 786 N.W.2d 498,\n\n502 (Iowa Ct. App. 2009).\n\n      Having been unsuccessful on his direct appeals, Harkins filed an\n\napplication for postconviction relief. There he alleged four different bases\n\nfor ineffective assistance, including an allegation that his counsel should\n\nhave advised him not to testify at trial. The application was denied by\n\nthe district court, and that denial was affirmed by the court of appeals on\n\nJanuary 22, 2010.      Harkins v. State, No. 08–2048, 2010 WL 200408\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2010).\n\n      Meanwhile, Harkins was incarcerated in the Mount Pleasant\n\nCorrectional Facility. During 2007 and the first part of 2008, Harkins\n\nremained on the waiting list for the institution’s sex offender treatment\n\nprogram (SOTP).     On or about July 2, 2008, an opening in the SOTP\n\nbecame available. Harkins alleges, and the State does not dispute, that\n\nbefore he could participate in the program, Harkins had to sign a\n\n“Treatment Contract,” in which he “agree[d] to be completely honest and\n\nassume full responsibility for [his] offenses and [his] behavior.” Harkins\n\nrefused to sign the contract and to participate in the SOTP. In response,\n\non July 9, 2008, the Iowa Department of Corrections (IDOC) suspended\n\nHarkins’s earned time pursuant to Iowa Code section 903A.2(1)(a) (2007).\n\n      Section 903A.2(1)(a) states an inmate under the control of IDOC\n\nserving a category “A” sentence 1 is eligible for earned-time credit “equal\n\nto one and two-tenths days for each day the inmate demonstrates good\n\nconduct and satisfactorily participates in any program . . . identified by\n\nthe director [of the department of corrections].”         In addition to this\n\ngeneral statement, the statute also provides that “an inmate required to\n\n      1Harkins is serving a category “A” sentence because he is not subject to a\nmandatory minimum under Iowa Code section 902.12. See Iowa Code § 903A.2(1)(a).\n\f                                    5\n\nparticipate in a sex offender treatment program shall not be eligible for a\n\nreduction of sentence unless the inmate participates in and completes a\n\nsex offender treatment program established by the director.” Iowa Code\n\n§ 903A.2(1)(a).\n\n      Following the suspension of his earned time, Harkins filed the\n\napplication for postconviction relief at issue in this appeal.    Harkins\n\nargued, essentially, that the suspension of his earned-time credits for\n\nfailure to participate in the SOTP violated his Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination. In particular, Harkins alleged:\n      I have maintained innocen[c]e since day one. I had my\n      appeal and am now going through postconviction relief with\n      my case. I cannot enter treatment because this would be an\n      admission of guilt and would perjur[e] myself in changing my\n      story. Also it would hinder any chance at a new trial if I\n      would sign a confession.\n\n      The district court granted Harkins’s application in part and denied\n\nit in part. The district court determined that by conditioning Harkins’s\n\nearned time upon his participation in the SOTP, in which Harkins would\n\nbe required to acknowledge his criminal conduct, the State was\n\nunconstitutionally compelling Harkins to give testimony. However, the\n\ndistrict court found the testimony would be potentially incriminating only\n\nuntil March 21, 2009, i.e., the last day on which the State could\n\nprosecute Harkins for perjury based upon his 2006 trial testimony. See\n\nIowa Code § 802.3 (three-year statute of limitations).    Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court ordered Harkins’s earned time to be reinstated from July 9,\n\n2008 through March 21, 2009, but suspended as of March 22, 2009,\n\nuntil he participated in and completed the SOTP.\n\n      Both Harkins and the State filed petitions for a writ of certiorari.\n\nHarkins argued the district court should not have suspended his accrual\n\nof earned time as of March 22, 2009.      The State, in turn, argued the\n\f                                            6\n\ndistrict court should have upheld its original decision to suspend\n\nHarkins’s earned time as of July 9, 2008, the date when he refused to\n\nenter the treatment program.               We granted the two petitions and\n\nconsolidated the proceedings.\n\n       II. Standard of Review.\n\n       We normally review certiorari actions for correction of errors at\n\nlaw. Iowa R. Civ. P. 6.907; Johnson v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 756 N.W.2d 845,\n\n847 (Iowa 2008).        However, we have recognized a general exception to\n\nthis standard of review when a certiorari action is brought alleging a\n\nviolation of a constitutional right. State v. Cullison, 227 N.W.2d 121, 126\n\n(Iowa 1975).         In these circumstances, we make an independent\n\nevaluation of the totality of the circumstances under which the\n\nchallenged ruling on the constitutional right was made.                    Id.   That is,\n\nwhen a constitutional issue is presented, the evidence relevant to that\n\nissue is reviewed de novo. Lewis v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 555 N.W.2d 216, 218\n\n(Iowa 1996).\n\n       III. Discussion and Analysis.\n\n       A. General Framework of Fifth Amendment Analysis. The Fifth\n\nAmendment, whose text we have quoted above, applies to the State of\n\nIowa through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution. 2          State v. Walls, 761 N.W.2d 683, 685\n\n\n       2Although   the Iowa Constitution does not contain an equivalent provision\nagainst self-incrimination, we have held such a right to be implicit in the “due process\nof law” guaranteed by Article I, section 9. State v. Height, 117 Iowa 650, 659, 91 N.W.\n935, 938 (1902). In this case, though, neither Harkins, the State, nor the district court\nmentioned the Iowa Constitution. See State v. Griffin, 691 N.W.2d 734, 736 (Iowa 2005)\n(finding a state constitutional claim was not preserved when the Federal Constitution\nwas the sole ground raised in the district court); State v. Wilkins, 687 N.W.2d 263, 265\n(Iowa 2004) (same).\n      Harkins’s original application for postconviction relief did not cite legal authority\nbut simply alleged self-incrimination. An unreported hearing was held, at which\nHarkins apparently cited to Johnson v. Fabian, 735 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. 2007), a\n\f                                              7\n\n(Iowa 2009) (citing Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 6, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 1492,\n\n12 L. Ed. 2d 653, 658 (1964)).                The Fifth Amendment’s guarantees\n\nextend to Harkins despite his conviction and imprisonment. Minnesota\n\nv. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 426, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 1141, 79 L. Ed. 2d 409,\n\n418 (1984).\n\n       In order for a party to show a violation of the privilege against self-\n\nincrimination, that party must show that he or she is being compelled to\n\ngive testimony that presents an impermissible risk of incriminating him or\n\nher.   See Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist., 542 U.S. 177, 189, 124 S. Ct.\n\n2451, 2460, 159 L. Ed. 2d 292, 305 (2004) (“To qualify for the Fifth\n\nAmendment         privilege,     a    communication           must      be    testimonial,\n\nincriminating, and compelled.”).\n\n       As a general rule, compulsion is present when the state threatens\n\nto inflict “potent sanctions” unless the constitutional privilege is waived\n\nor threatens to impose “substantial penalties” because a person elects to\n\nexercise that privilege. Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 805, 97\n\nS. Ct. 2132, 2135–36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1, 7 (1977).\n\n       Thus, in a series of decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has held\n\nthat states may not penalize an individual by taking away his or her\n\n________________________________\ndecision based on the Fifth Amendment. The district court then issued a ruling that\naddressed only the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Neither party\nsought to enlarge that ruling by raising the Iowa Constitution. See Iowa R. Civ. P.\n1.904(2); State v. Mitchell, 757 N.W.2d 431, 435 (Iowa 2008) (holding that when a\ndefendant argues a constitutional violation, but the district court fails to address it, it is\nincumbent upon the defendant to “file a motion to enlarge the trial court’s findings or in\nany other manner have the district court address th[e] issue”).\n        In its brief to us, the State maintains that “[n]o state claims have been raised,\nand the only issue raised is one of federal Fifth Amendment law.” Harkins has not\ndisputed this point; to the contrary, in his pro se appellate brief he cited to the Fifth\nAmendment four separate times. For all these reasons, we confine our analysis to the\nU.S. Constitution. See State v. Palmer, 791 N.W.2d 840, 844 (Iowa 2010) (limiting a\nself-incrimination analysis to the Federal Constitution when no challenges under the\nIowa Constitution were raised in the district court or on appeal).\n\f                                      8\n\ngovernment employment, professional license, or certain other rights and\n\nprivileges in direct response to the individual’s assertion of Fifth\n\nAmendment rights. See id. at 807, 97 S. Ct. at 2136, 53 L. Ed. 2d at 8\n\n(loss of the right to participate in political associations and hold public\n\noffice); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 82, 94 S. Ct. 316, 324–25, 38 L.\n\nEd. 2d 274, 284 (1973) (ineligibility to receive government contracts);\n\nUniformed Sanitation Men Ass’n, Inc. v. Comm’r of Sanitation, 392 U.S.\n\n280, 284, 88 S. Ct. 1917, 1920, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1089, 1092 (1968) (loss of\n\nemployment); Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 516, 87 S. Ct. 625, 628, 17\n\nL. Ed. 2d 574, 578 (1967) (revocation of a professional license). In each\n\ninstance,   the      government’s   threatened   penalty   jeopardized   the\n\nindividual’s current livelihood or professional status, and the penalty was\n\nspecifically tied to the exercise of Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n      This case is somewhat different. Harkins is not a free man, but is\n\npresently serving a ten-year term of imprisonment.             The question\n\nconcerns his eligibility for earned-time credits that might reduce that\n\nsentence.   Also, the suspension of credits is not a direct result of\n\nHarkins’s invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination, but rather\n\nhis refusal to participate in a SOTP where the SOTP requires assumption\n\nof responsibility.    No one disputes that the SOTP was established for\n\nbona fide rehabilitative purposes, or that requiring the offender to\n\nacknowledge responsibility for his offense serves one of those purposes.\n\nAnother U.S. Supreme Court decision provides guidance here.\n\n      B. McKune v. Lile.       In McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S. Ct.\n\n2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2002), the U.S. Supreme Court addressed Fifth\n\nAmendment rights in the context of a prison rehabilitation program for\n\nconvicted sex offenders.      In that case, the Court found the Kansas\n\nDepartment of Corrections (KDOC) did not violate the constitutional\n\f                                      9\n\nrights of Lile, a convicted sex offender, when it threatened to curtail Lile’s\n\nprison privileges unless he participated in rehabilitative treatment that\n\nrequired him to disclose his past sex offenses. The privileges at stake\n\nincluded visitation rights, earnings, work opportunities, ability to send\n\nmoney to family, canteen expenditures, and access to a personal\n\ntelevision. McKune, 536 U.S. at 30–31, 122 S. Ct. at 2023, 153 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 55 (plurality opinion). In addition, because Lile refused to undergo the\n\ntreatment, he was going to be transferred to a maximum-security unit\n\nwhere his movement would be more limited, he would have four as\n\nopposed to two cellmates, and he would be in a potentially more\n\ndangerous environment. Id. The Court held that depriving Lile of these\n\nvarious privileges because of his refusal to participate in the treatment\n\nwould not violate Lile’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nId. at 47–48, 122 S. Ct. at 2032, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66; id. at 54, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 70 (O’Connor, J., concurring). The Court also\n\nrecognized the possibility that Kansas could grant use immunity for\n\nstatements made in the course of treatment as a way of avoiding\n\npotential   Fifth   Amendment     problems,    but   found    this   was   not\n\nconstitutionally required. Id. at 34–35, 122 S. Ct. at 2025, 153 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 57–58 (plurality opinion).\n\n      McKune did not produce a majority opinion.             Justice Kennedy\n\nwrote for four of the justices in the majority, Justice Stevens spoke for\n\nfour dissenting justices, and Justice O’Connor, writing separately from\n\nthe other eight justices, concurred in the judgment upholding the actions\n\nof the KDOC.\n\n      Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion initially noted the benefits of\n\nsex offender treatment.      There is a high rate of recidivism among\n\nuntreated sex offenders and a broad range of agreement among\n\f                                       10\n\ntherapists and correctional officers that clinical rehabilitation programs\n\n“can enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in this way\n\nreduce recidivism.” Id. at 32–33, 122 S. Ct. at 2024, 153 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n56–57. He further pointed out:\n        An important component of those rehabilitation programs\n        requires participants to confront their past and accept\n        responsibility for their misconduct. . . . Research indicates\n        that offenders who deny all allegations of sexual abuse are\n        three times more likely to fail in treatment than those who\n        admit even partial complicity.\n\nId. at 33, 122 S. Ct. at 2024, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 57 (citations omitted).\n\nThus,    Justice    Kennedy    described    the   offender’s    “acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility for past offenses” as “[t]he critical first step.” Id. at 33, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2025, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 57.\n\n        Justice Kennedy also observed that, while the Fifth Amendment\n\napplies to everyone, “the fact of a valid conviction and the ensuing\n\nrestrictions on liberty are essential to the Fifth Amendment analysis.” Id.\n\nat 36, 122 S. Ct. at 2026, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 59.                     He added,\n\n“[R]ehabilitation is a legitimate penological interest that must be weighed\n\nagainst the exercise of an inmate’s liberty.” Id.\n\n        After   setting   out these   basic parameters,        Justice Kennedy\n\nconcluded that the Kansas program, as administered by Kansas prison\n\nofficials, did not amount to “unconstitutional compulsion.”              As he\n\nexplained:\n        A prison clinical rehabilitation program, which is\n        acknowledged to bear a rational relation to a legitimate\n        penological objective, does not violate the privilege against\n        self-incrimination if the adverse consequences an inmate\n        faces for not participating are related to the program\n        objectives and do not constitute atypical and significant\n        hardships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\nId. at 37–38, 122 S. Ct. at 2027, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 60. Justice Kennedy\n\nalso noted that Lile’s decision not to participate did not “affect his\n\f                                      11\n\neligibility for good-time credits or parole.” Id. at 38, 122 S. Ct. at 2027,\n\n153 L. Ed. 2d at 60.       In this part of his opinion, Justice Kennedy\n\nborrowed from earlier language in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484,\n\n115 S. Ct. 2293, 2300, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 430 (1995), which held that\n\nchallenged prison conditions cannot give rise to a due process violation\n\nunless they impose “atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\n      Yet Justice Kennedy also declined to treat the compulsion inquiry\n\nas simply a comparison between the individual’s conditions after he or\n\nshe invoked Fifth Amendment rights and a preexisting “baseline.”\n\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 45–47, 122 S. Ct. at 2031–32, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 65.\n\nSuch an approach was unsatisfactory, because compulsion involved “a\n\nquestion of judgment.” Id. at 41, 122 S. Ct. at 2028, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 62.\n\nOften, the criminal process presents defendants with “choices” that do\n\nnot give rise to a Fifth Amendment claim. Id. at 41, 122 S. Ct. at 2029,\n\n153 L. Ed. 2d at 62.\n\n      Justice Kennedy pointed to several instances within the criminal\n\njustice system where the government has been allowed to impose quite\n\nserious   consequences     on   defendants    who     stand   on   their   Fifth\n\nAmendment rights. Id. at 42–43, 122 S. Ct. at 2029–30, 153 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n63 (citing Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 118 S. Ct.\n\n1244, 140 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1998) (allowing death row inmate’s silence at a\n\nclemency hearing to be used against him); Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S.\n\n420, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 79 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1984) (no constitutional violation\n\nin requiring defendant to be truthful with the probation officer in all\n\nmatters as a condition of probation); Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308,\n\n96 S. Ct. 1551, 47 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1976) (permitting punitive segregation\n\nand downgrade of prison classification status based on silence at a\n\f                                    12\n\nprison disciplinary hearing)). As Justice Kennedy put it, “The parties in\n\nWoodard, Murphy, and Baxter all were faced with ramifications far worse\n\nthan respondent faces here, and in each of those cases the Court\n\ndetermined that their hard choice between silence and the consequences\n\nwas not compelled.” Id. at 44–45, 122 S. Ct. at 2030, 153 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n64. Also, in the federal criminal system, defendants typically receive a\n\ndownward adjustment in their sentence for pleading guilty, and\n\nconversely suffer a longer sentence if they do not plead guilty, but this\n\nfeature is “accepted” and not regarded as a violation of the defendant’s\n\nFifth Amendment rights. Id. at 47, 122 S. Ct. at 2032, 153 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n65–66.\n\n      In the concluding paragraphs of his opinion, Justice Kennedy\n\nreturned to his initial themes and summarized as follows:\n            Acceptance of responsibility is the beginning of\n      rehabilitation. And a recognition that there are rewards for\n      those who attempt to reform is a vital and necessary step\n      toward completion. The Court of Appeals’ ruling would\n      defeat these objectives. . . .\n            The Kansas SATP [Sexual Abuse Treatment Program]\n      represents a sensible approach to reducing the serious\n      danger that repeat sex offenders pose to many innocent\n      persons, most often children.       The State’s interest in\n      rehabilitation is undeniable.    There is, furthermore, no\n      indication that the SATP is merely an elaborate ruse to skirt\n      the protections of the privilege against compelled self-\n      incrimination.       Rather, the program allows prison\n      administrators to provide to those who need treatment the\n      incentive to seek it.\n\nId. at 47–48, 122 S. Ct. at 2032, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66.\n\n      In short, for the plurality represented by Justice Kennedy’s\n\nopinion, the loss of various prison privileges clearly did not amount to\n\ncompulsion because such deprivations were not “atypical and significant\n\nhardships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at 38;\n\n122 S. Ct. at 2027, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 60. But the plurality also indicated\n\f                                     13\n\nthat degree of hardship was not the ultimate question, and they did not\n\ndefine the outer limits of what prison officials could do to encourage\n\nparticipation in a sex offender treatment program. Taken as a whole, the\n\nplurality opinion approves the state’s use of incentives—even “hard\n\nchoice[s],” id. at 45, 122 S. Ct. at 2030, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 64—to obtain\n\nparticipation in sex offender treatment programs requiring acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.\n\n      Justice Stevens, writing for four dissenting justices, strenuously\n\ndisagreed with the plurality’s view that Lile’s threatened loss of privileges\n\ndid not amount to unconstitutional compulsion. He acknowledged that\n\nthe SATP “clearly serves legitimate therapeutic purposes.” Id. at 68, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2043, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 79 (Stevens, J., dissenting). As he put it,\n\n“Mental health professionals seem to agree that accepting responsibility\n\nfor past sexual misconduct is often essential to successful treatment,\n\nand that treatment programs can reduce the risk of recidivism by sex\n\noffenders.”   Id.   Yet he concluded that Kansas could not “punish an\n\ninmate’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege with the same\n\nmandatory sanction that follows a disciplinary conviction for an offense\n\nsuch as theft, sodomy, riot, arson, or assault.” Id. at 54, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2035–36, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 70.\n\n      Justice Stevens pointed out that Lile’s shift to a maximum-security\n\nunit and his loss of visitation and the ability to earn up to minimum\n\nwage in the present case amounted to “a serious loss of tangible\n\nprivileges.” Id. at 63–64, 122 S. Ct. at 2040–41, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 76. He\n\nadded, “[T]he sanctions are in fact severe, but even if that were not so,\n\nthe plurality’s policy judgment does not justify the evisceration of a\n\nconstitutional right.” Id. at 54, 122 S. Ct. at 2036, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 70–\n\n71. Justice Stevens also disagreed with the proposition that the prior\n\f                                    14\n\ncriminal justice cases like Woodard and Baxter were relevant because\n\nthey had upheld the imposition of sanctions on prisoners who asserted\n\nFifth Amendment rights. In his view, there was an important distinction\n\nbetween the mandatory, official sanction present in Lile’s case and “a\n\nmere risk of adverse consequences stemming from a voluntary choice” in\n\ncases like Woodard, Murphy, and Baxter.       Id. at 59–62, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2038–40, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 73–75. In Woodard, for example, the inmate’s\n\ninvocation of Fifth Amendment rights in the clemency proceeding could\n\nbe held against him, but adverse consequences were not “automatic.” Id.\n\nat 59–60, 122 S. Ct. at 2038–39, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 74. Justice Stevens\n\nalso stated that Kansas could achieve its objectives without impinging on\n\nthe Fifth Amendment privilege by granting use immunity to participants.\n\nId. at 69–70, 122 S. Ct. at 2043–44, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 80.\n\n      Justice O’Connor took a third approach. In the first part of her\n\nconcurrence, she expressed the view that the penalties Lile faced were\n\nnot “sufficiently serious to compel his testimony.” Id. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2034, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).          This was a\n\nsufficient basis for her to uphold the actions of the KDOC and concur in\n\nthe result.   Nonetheless, she went on to criticize the plurality for\n\nsuggesting that more serious consequences such as “longer incarceration\n\nand execution” could not constitute unconstitutional compulsion. Id.\n\n      Yet Justice O’Connor also criticized the dissent for its inability to\n\ndraw a reasoned distinction between the “criminal justice” cases such as\n\nWoodard, Murphy, and Baxter—which upheld more severe sanctions than\n\nthose imposed on Lile (e.g., loss of life in Woodard)—and the “penalty”\n\ncases such as Cunningham, Turley, Uniformed Sanitation Men, and\n\nSpevack. Id. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69. She agreed\n\nwith the plurality that the inmates in Woodard, Murphy, and Baxter, as a\n\f                                    15\n\npractical matter, faced more onerous penalties; the dissenters’ attempt to\n\ndistinguish those cases on the ground that the penalties there were not\n\n“automatic” did not persuade her. Id.\n\n      In Justice O’Connor’s view, the critical issue for Fifth Amendment\n\npurposes was not necessarily the actual penalty or sanction, but the\n\ncontext within which it was imposed. She elaborated:\n              I believe the proper theory [of the Fifth Amendment\n      privilege against self-incrimination] should recognize that it\n      is generally acceptable to impose the risk of punishment,\n      however great, so long as the actual imposition of such\n      punishment is accomplished through a fair criminal process.\n      . . . Forcing defendants to accept such consequences seems\n      to me very different from imposing penalties for the refusal to\n      incriminate oneself that go beyond the criminal process and\n      appear, starkly, as government attempts to compel\n      testimony; in the latter context, any penalty that is capable\n      of compelling a person to be a witness against himself is\n      illegitimate.\n\nId. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69–70.\n\n      Under the narrowest grounds doctrine, the holding of a fragmented\n\nSupreme Court decision with no majority opinion “ ‘may be viewed as\n\nthat position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments\n\non the narrowest grounds.’ ” Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193,\n\n97 S. Ct. 990, 993, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260, 266 (1977) (quoting Gregg v.\n\nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 n.15, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2923, n.15, 49 L. Ed.\n\n2d 859, 872 n.15 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)).\n\nJustice O’Connor’s concurrence therefore controls here.\n\n      As we read Justice O’Connor’s concurrence, “compulsion” is not a\n\nsimple, straightforward continuum based on the severity of the sanction.\n\nRather, under a “proper theory,” the critical questions are whether the\n\nsanction was “accomplished through a fair criminal process” and\n\nwhether the state was engaged in a “stark[]” attempt to compel\n\ntestimony. McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at\n\f                                    16\n\n69 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Justice O’Connor thus appears to allow\n\nfor the possibility that individuals who have been convicted through a\n\n“fair criminal process” can suffer significant adverse consequences,\n\nincluding a potentially longer period of incarceration, for choosing not to\n\nacknowledge their offense, provided the state was not engaged in a direct\n\neffort to compel testimony. See also id. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 70 (Justice O’Connor noting that the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines offer the potential benefit of a lower sentence in exchange for\n\nthe defendant’s acceptance of responsibility).\n\n      In this regard, Justice O’Connor’s concurrence shares considerable\n\nground with Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion. Both opinions, in the\n\nend, do not regard compulsion as a simple “How serious is the\n\nconsequence?” inquiry.     Rather, both of them recognize that a fair\n\ncriminal process may impose difficult choices on defendants to serve a\n\nvalid penological goal, without crossing the line into unconstitutional\n\ncompulsion.\n\n      C. Post-McKune Decisions of Federal Appellate Courts. In the\n\nwake of McKune, a number of federal appellate courts have had to decide\n\nwhether it violates the Fifth Amendment when a sex offender receives\n\nmore prison time, rather than just stricter prison conditions, because he or\n\nshe refused to participate in a treatment program that required him or\n\nher to admit past sex crimes.       For the most part, based on their\n\nunderstanding of the scope of McKune, they have rejected these Fifth\n\nAmendment claims.\n\n      In Searcy v. Simmons, 299 F.3d 1220 (10th Cir. 2002), a case that\n\nhad been held by the appellate court pending McKune, the Tenth Circuit\n\nconcluded a Kansas sex offender’s loss of the ability to earn good-time\n\ncredits because he refused to accept responsibility for his crime and\n\f                                    17\n\ndisclose other possible sex crimes did not violate the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe court acknowledged that this specific situation was not expressly\n\ncovered by McKune. Searcy, 299 F.3d at 1225. Nonetheless, applying\n\nJustice O’Connor’s concurrence as the dispositive opinion, the court\n\nfound that Searcy had been convicted in a “fair criminal process,” and\n\n“[w]hile the potential for incrimination is not disputed, there is no\n\nassertion that the KDOC is using the SATP as a surreptitious means to\n\nobtain evidence for criminal prosecutions.” Id. at 1226–27. As the court\n\nexplained:\n      Mr. Searcy’s lost privileges and lost opportunity to earn\n      future good time credits are quite simply not the result of his\n      refusal to incriminate himself, but are a consequence of his\n      inability to complete rehabilitation the KDOC has\n      determined—in light of the serious offense for which Mr.\n      Searcy was convicted—is in the best interest for Mr. Searcy\n      and society.\n\nId. at 1227.\n\n      Ainsworth v. Stanley, 317 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002), decided on\n\nremand after McKune, reached a similar outcome. There the First Circuit\n\nheld New Hampshire could constitutionally deny parole in most\n\ninstances to sex offenders who refused to accept responsibility for their\ncrimes. That court commented that “Justice O’Connor does not purport\n\nto lay out any abstract analysis or unifying theory that would prefigure\n\nher views regarding the constitutionality of New Hampshire’s program,”\n\nand therefore “we have no clear guideposts.” Ainsworth, 317 F.3d at 4.\n\nHence, the First Circuit deferred to its previously expressed view that\n\nunder recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the compulsion\n\nanalysis “is more circumscribed in the prison context” and only\n\n“unreasonable” burdens are proscribed.      Id. at 5.   Reiterating its pre-\n\nMcKune approach, the First Circuit concluded that New Hampshire could\n\f                                      18\n\nsubject sex offenders who refused to participate in treatment that\n\nrequired acceptance of responsibility to the likelihood of a longer period\n\nof incarceration, because the overall burden was not unreasonable in\n\nlight of the relevant circumstances, including “the voluntary nature of\n\nthe program” (i.e., participation is a choice) and the state’s “valid”\n\ninterest in effective rehabilitation. Id. at 5–6.\n\n      Although the First Circuit purported to be following its own earlier\n\nprecedents rather than Justice O’Connor’s concurrence, one can argue\n\nthat its analytical approach is not that different from hers. The “factors”\n\nmentioned in its opinion, i.e., that the defendant was presented with a\n\nchoice within a fair criminal process and that the state’s purpose was not\n\ntestimonial, surface also in Justice O’Connor’s discussion of “proper\n\ntheory” of the Fifth Amendment. McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n      A few years later, in Entzi v. Redmann, 485 F.3d 998 (8th Cir.\n\n2007), the Eighth Circuit denied a sex offender’s claim that North Dakota\n\nviolated his Fifth Amendment rights by withholding sentence-reduction\n\ncredits when he refused to report to a sex offender education class where\n\nhe would have had to admit his offense. Relying expressly on Searcy and\n\nJustice O’Connor’s concurrence in McKune, the court found that the loss\n\nof an opportunity for a discretionary sentence-reduction credit “is not\n\namong the consequences for noncompliance that go ‘beyond the criminal\n\nprocess and appear, starkly, as government attempts to compel\n\ntestimony.’ ” Entzi, 485 F.3d at 1004 (quoting McKune, 536 U.S. at 53,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring)). This\n\ncourt found, therefore, no unconstitutional compulsion. Id.\n\n      Likewise, in DeFoy v. McCullough, 301 F. App’x 177 (3rd Cir. 2008),\n\nthe Third Circuit upheld Pennsylvania’s denial of reparole to a sex\n\f                                           19\n\noffender based in part on the offender’s refusal to participate in a\n\ntreatment program.         The treatment program would have required the\n\ninmate to admit his guilt even though he had obtained a new trial on the\n\nunderlying charges.         DeFoy, 301 F.App’x at 178.              Applying Justice\n\nO’Connor’s concurrence, the court reasoned that no unconstitutional\n\ncompulsion had occurred.             DeFoy’s sentence was not extended; he\n\n“merely had to serve the rest of his sentence, imposed through a fair\n\ncriminal process.”       Id.   Furthermore, “DeFoy was not denied reparole\n\nbecause he invoked the Fifth Amendment, but rather, primarily because\n\nhe chose not to participate in treatment.”                 Id. at 182.       Thus, the\n\nconsiderations noted by Justice O’Connor in her concurrence—i.e., the\n\nsanction merely forced the prisoner to serve out a sentence imposed in a\n\nfair criminal process, the prisoner was given a choice, and the purpose of\n\nthe program was truly rehabilitative rather than to obtain testimony, see\n\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)—were dispositive in overruling the Fifth\n\nAmendment claim. 3 DeFoy, 301 F.App’x at 182.\n\n\n\n\n        3At least one of these federal appellate decisions, i.e., Searcy, involved an\n\nautomatic loss of eligibility for sentence-reduction credits, similar to Iowa Code section\n903A.2(1)(a). Under the program at issue in Searcy, failure to participate in the\ntreatment program meant that the inmate forfeited eligibility for sentence-reduction\ncredits, but (as in Iowa) participation did not guarantee a reduction in sentence.\nSearcy, 299 F.3d at 1223 (noting that an inmate who refuses to participate in a sex\noffender treatment program “loses the opportunity to earn any further good time\ncredits” and “those credits . . . cannot be regained”); see also Ainsworth, 317 F.3d at 3\n(noting that “nonparticipation in the [sex offenders program] almost always results in\nan inmate being denied parole”); DeFoy, 301 F. App’x at 179 (noting that “it was the\nrare case that parole was granted without treatment”). As we point out above, Justice\nO’Connor’s concurrence rejects the notion urged by Justice Stevens in dissent that it\nmakes a constitutional difference whether “the negative outcome” follows directly from\n“the decision to remain silent,” McKune, 536 U.S. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed.\n2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring), or whether the decision simply makes that outcome\nmore likely.\n\f                                     20\n\n      The Ninth Circuit reached a different result in United States v.\n\nAntelope, 395 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2005), but the facts there were\n\nsomewhat different. The defendant had pled guilty to possession of child\n\npornography and was required to participate in a treatment program as a\n\ncondition of obtaining supervised release. Antelope, 395 F.3d at 1131.\n\nThe defendant had no Fifth Amendment objection to admitting the crime\n\nof which he had been convicted, but objected to having to disclose other\n\npotential criminal conduct in the course of the program. Id. Although\n\nthe court found a violation of the defendant’s right against self-\n\nincrimination, its overall interpretation of O’Connor’s concurrence does\n\nnot appear to vary from that of the other circuits. To the contrary, the\n\nNinth Circuit found that under her concurrence,\n      the compulsion inquiry does not dispositively turn on the\n      status of the person claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege\n      or on the severity of the penalty imposed, although these\n      factors may bear on the analysis. Instead, the controlling\n      issue is the state’s purpose in imposing the penalty:\n      Although it may be acceptable for the state to impose harsh\n      penalties on defendants when it has legitimate reasons for\n      doing so consistent with their conviction for their crimes of\n      incarceration, it is a different thing to impose “penalties for\n      the refusal to incriminate oneself that go beyond the criminal\n      process and appear, starkly, as government attempts to\n      compel testimony.”\n\nId. at 1137 (quoting McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring)). A crucial point for the Ninth\n\nCircuit was that the federal government was sanctioning “Antelope for\n\nhis self-protective silence about conduct that might constitute other\n\ncrimes.”   Id.   These kinds of disclosures, the Ninth Circuit felt, were\n\n“starkly   incriminating”   regardless    of   their   potential   rehabilitative\n\npurpose. Id. at 1138.\n\n      D. Post-McKune Decisions of State Appellate Courts.                     In\n\naddition to these five federal appellate courts, several state appellate\n\f                                     21\n\ncourts have addressed whether a Fifth Amendment violation occurs when\n\na convicted sex offender’s release date is adversely affected because the\n\noffender refused to participate in a treatment program that required\n\nadmission of responsibility. The results have been more divided. Some\n\ncourts have found no Fifth Amendment violation.        See, e.g., People v.\n\nLehmkuhl, 117 P.3d 98, 108 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004); Spencer v. State, 334\n\nS.W.3d 559, 568 (Mo. Ct. App. 2010); Dzul v. State, 56 P.3d 875, 884–85\n\n(Nev. 2002); Wilson v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole, 942 A.2d 270, 273 (Pa.\n\nCommw. Ct. 2008); State v. Pritchett, 69 P.3d 1278, 1286–87 (Utah\n\n2003).    Others have.   See, e.g., James v. State, 75 P.3d 1065, 1068\n\n(Alaska Ct. App. 2003) (state conceded compulsion); Bender v. N.J. Dep’t\n\nof Corr., 812 A.2d 1154, 1160–61 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003); State\n\nex rel. Tate v. Schwarz, 654 N.W.2d 438, 442–45 (Wis. 2002).\n\n      In Johnson v. Fabian, 735 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. 2007), cited by the\n\ndistrict court below, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that convicted\n\nsex offenders could not have their sentences extended beyond their\n\npresumptive terms based on their refusal to participate in sex offender\n\ntreatment programs that would have required them to admit their\n\ncrimes.\n\n      Johnson involved two consolidated appeals of defendants who had\n\nbeen convicted of criminal sexual conduct. Each received an “executed\n\nsentence,” which under Minnesota’s sentencing scheme typically equated\n\nto a term of actual imprisonment of two-thirds that amount. 735 N.W.2d\n\nat 299. The term of actual imprisonment was subject to extension if the\n\ndefendant committed a disciplinary offense while incarcerated. Id. When\n\nthe defendants refused to participate in Minnesota’s sex offender\n\ntreatment    program,    those   refusals   were   considered   disciplinary\n\nviolations, and their terms of actual imprisonment were extended by\n\f                                   22\n\nforty-five days. Id. at 298. The defendants challenged these extensions\n\nas violating their Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n      In assessing the defendants’ Fifth Amendment claims, the Johnson\n\ncourt agreed that McKune was the relevant precedent. But it declined to\n\nfollow the “comments about sanctions that extend the term of\n\nincarceration” in both the plurality opinion and Justice O’Connor’s\n\nopinion on the grounds they were dicta. Id. at 304. Instead, the Johnson\n\ncourt ultimately concluded that under both opinions, “atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship” was the relevant benchmark. Id. at 304–05. That\n\nis, if the sanction amounted to such a hardship, it was “compulsion”; if\n\nnot, it was not. Id. As the Minnesota court put it:\n      [I]t is clear to us that a majority composed of the plurality\n      and Justice O’Connor (and likely the dissenting Justices as\n      well) agreed in McKune that consequences that impose\n      atypical and significant hardship in prison constitute\n      compulsion for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nId. at 306.   The court then went on to hold that forty-five days of\n\nadditional incarceration met the “atypical and significant hardship” test\n\nand therefore constituted unconstitutional compulsion. Id. at 306–09.\n\n      Two dissenting justices in Johnson disagreed with their colleagues’\n\nreading of McKune.     They maintained that neither the plurality nor\n\nJustice O’Connor had endorsed “atypical and significant hardship” as the\n\nstandard for whether compulsion was present. Id. at 313. At most, the\n\npresence of such a hardship was a necessary but not sufficient condition\n\nfor finding compulsion. Id. Discerning “no clear guideposts” in McKune,\n\nthe dissenters argued that Minnesota should continue to follow its pre-\n\nMcKune precedent that extending an inmate’s supervised release date\n\ndue to his failure to participate in a sex offender program was not\n\n“compulsion” in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 312–14 (citing\n\f                                        23\n\nState ex rel. Morrow v. LaFleur, 590 N.W.2d 787, 789 (Minn. 1999)). The\n\ndissent elaborated:\n             Numerous federal circuit courts have considered this\n      issue and held that extension of a supervised release date for\n      failure to participate in treatment is not compulsion. While\n      the majority cites cases that have held differently, I find that\n      the Supreme Court has not spoken clearly on this issue, nor\n      is there a national consensus that would compel us to\n      overturn Morrow. I would hold that extending an inmate’s\n      supervised release date because of his failure to participate\n      in a sex offender treatment program does not rise to the level\n      of compulsion necessary to violate the inmate’s Fifth\n      Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nId. at 315 (citations omitted).\n\n      We    have   some    difficulty    squaring   the   Johnson   majority’s\n\ninterpretation of McKune with our own. While neither Justice Kennedy\n\nnor Justice O’Connor in McKune precisely delineated the permissible\n\nouter limits of “compulsion” in the prison context, neither indicated that\n\nimposing an “atypical and significant hardship” would automatically\n\ncross those limits.   To the contrary, both opinions noted that in prior\n\ncases, like Woodard, states had been allowed to impose far more serious\n\nconsequences, such as a potential loss of clemency, on inmates who\n\nchose to exercise their Fifth Amendment rights.           Thus, both opinions\n\nfound that the question of compulsion had to be analyzed in context,\n\nwith particular emphasis (according to Justice O’Connor) on whether the\n\nconsequence arose as a choice afforded by a fair criminal process and\n\nwhether the underlying purpose was rehabilitative rather than the\n\ncompulsion of testimony.      In our view, the respective decisions of the\n\nTenth, Eighth, and Third Circuits in Searcy, Entzi, and DeFoy more\n\naccurately reflect this approach.\n\n      E. Applying McKune to This Case.              Based on our reading of\n\nMcKune, we find no Fifth Amendment violation here. The requirement\n\f                                     24\n\nthat Harkins participate in the SOTP to be eligible for earned-time credits\n\nwas part of “a fair criminal process.” McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).             Section\n\n903A.2(1)(a), which established this requirement, was the law both when\n\nHarkins was alleged to have sexually assaulted his victim, and when he\n\nwas convicted of doing so. Thus, from the moment Harkins committed\n\nhis crime, it was clear that if he was convicted and chose not to\n\nparticipate in the prescribed treatment program, he would not be eligible\n\nfor earned-time credits.     That was the set of consequences for his\n\nconduct prescribed by the legislature.\n\n      Encouraging a convicted sex offender to participate in a SOTP\n\nwhere he has to acknowledge his crime also serves important\n\nrehabilitative goals. The State of Iowa is not “starkly . . . attempt[ing] to\n\ncompel testimony.” Id. Rather, the undisputed purpose of the program\n\nis to get the offender to confront his or her past behavior so it does not\n\nreoccur. Harkins does not claim that he will be forced to disclose other,\n\nas-yet-unknown sex offenses. Cf. Antelope, 395 F.3d at 1137. In fact,\n\nthe only admission the State could obtain here is one it almost certainly\n\ndoes not need, since Harkins has been convicted and his conviction has\n\nbeen upheld on direct appeal.\n\n      The specifics of this case illustrate what the legislature might have\n\nhad in mind when it enacted section 903A.2(1)(a).            The evidence,\n\nsummarized above, supports a finding that Harkins committed a rather\n\nviolent sexual assault. Harkins’s original story to the police was that he\n\nhad not had sexual relations with the victim. At trial, Harkins changed\n\ncourse and admitted having had sex with the victim, but claimed it was\n\nconsensual.    Now, according to a memo that is part of the record,\n\nHarkins maintains, “I am not guilty and am not going to take the\n\f                                     25\n\nprogram.”       Under these circumstances, a rehabilitation program\n\nrequiring the offender to confront his past offense might be particularly\n\nbeneficial. We do not see the Fifth Amendment as a barrier to an earned-\n\ncredit incentive for Harkins to participate in such a program.\n\n         Both the plurality and the special concurrence in McKune\n\nindicated that compulsion in the prison setting is not a simple question\n\nof, “How big is the stick or carrot?”       Instead, Justice Kennedy and\n\nJustice O’Connor recognized that a convicted criminal defendant may be\n\nconfronted with choices, such as whether to take the stand at a clemency\n\nhearing or whether to participate in sex offender treatment, which might\n\nbe considered compulsion in other circumstances, but are deemed\n\nlegitimate exercises of state authority here.    We therefore need to ask\n\nwhether the choice arose as a result of the defendant’s conviction within\n\nthe criminal justice system and whether imposing the choice serves a\n\nproper goal of that system.     We have and we believe the answers are\n\nclear.\n\n         Thus, while a loss of eligibility for earned-time credits clearly\n\n“implicates a liberty interest,” Reilly v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 783 N.W.2d 490,\n\n496 (Iowa 2010), it does not equate in this case with unconstitutional\n\ncompulsion. The State is not using a threatened loss of credits to try to\n\nextract testimony; instead, it is attempting to administer a bona fide\n\nrehabilitation program for sex offenders who have already been found\n\nguilty under a statutory scheme that afforded them all required due\n\nprocess.\n         We also find support for this conclusion in In re C.H., 652 N.W.2d\n144 (Iowa 2002), where we addressed a father’s claim that his Fifth\nAmendment rights had been violated when his parental rights were\nterminated after he failed to complete a sex offender treatment program.\n\f                                          26\n\nWe made clear that “sexual offender treatment where the offender refuses\nto take responsibility for the abuse may constitute ineffective therapy,”\nand that the State of Iowa could terminate parental rights based on a\nparent sex offender’s “failure to obtain treatment for his or her\nproblems.” In re C.H., 652 N.W.2d at 150. We specifically noted that “a\nperson’s    exercise     of   a    constitutional     right    may     indeed     have\nconsequences”—without resulting in a Fifth Amendment violation.                     Id.\nJust as in C.H., where we held that a father who failed to complete a\ntreatment program due to his assertion of Fifth Amendment rights could\nsuffer loss of parental rights, so here we hold that a convicted sex\noffender who failed to complete a treatment program due to his assertion\nof Fifth Amendment rights may constitutionally have his eligibility for\nearned-time credits suspended.           If the loss of parental rights does not\namount to unconstitutional compulsion, it is difficult to see how the\nsuspension of earned-time credits would either—so long as in both cases\nthe State is not simply trying to obtain testimony for future use. 4\n       IV. Conclusion.\n       Harkins had every right not to be a witness against himself, a right\nhe actually chose to waive at trial by taking the stand. Now that he has\nbeen convicted as a sex offender, though, the State of Iowa may\nconstitutionally establish an incentive for him to obtain treatment in\nprison by withholding earned-time credits if he declines to participate.\n\n\n\n        4It is true we said in C.H., “The State may require parents to otherwise undergo\n\ntreatment, but it may not specifically require an admission of guilt as part of the\ntreatment.” 652 N.W.2d at 150. Thus, a distinction exists between the present case,\nwhere the SOTP expressly requires acceptance of responsibility, and C.H., where the\nState simply required treatment and admission of responsibility was part of the\ntreatment. Yet the more significant distinction cuts the other way. In this case,\nHarkins has already been convicted of a sex offense in a criminal proceeding; in C.H.,\nthe father had not been. Hence, there were more grounds for concern in C.H. about\n“stark[] government attempts to compel testimony.” McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct.\nat 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\f                                   27\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the writ requested by the\nState, we set aside the district court’s order to the extent it reinstated\nHarkins’s earned time for the period July 9, 2008, through March 21,\n2009, and we remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n      STATE’S WRIT SUSTAINED; HARKINS’S WRIT ANNULLED;\nCASE REMANDED.\n      All justices concur except Wiggins, Hecht, and Appel, JJ., who\ndissent.\n\f                                       28\n\n                 #09–0982, State v. Iowa Dist. Ct./Harkins v. Iowa Dist. Ct.\n\nAPPEL, Justice (dissenting).\n\n        I respectfully dissent. I would hold that Harkins is entitled to use\n\nand derivative-use immunity under the Federal Constitution with respect\n\nto incriminating statements that he may be required to make pursuant\n\nto his participation in the sex offender treatment program (SOTP) in this\n\ncase.\n\n        I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n        The facts are simple and undisputed. Harkins has been convicted\n\nof a sex crime. The State of Iowa has determined that he should receive\n\ntreatment in prison for sex offenders.      The SOTP requires Harkins to\n\naccept full responsibility for his offenses and behavior. The program also\n\nrequires that Harkins agree to undergo a polygraph examination.            If\n\nHarkins declines to participate in the SOTP, he will not receive earned-\n\ntime credit.     Simply put, if he chooses to remain silent by not\n\nparticipating in the program, he will likely be incarcerated for a\n\nsubstantially longer period of time.\n\n        Harkins cries foul.   He filed without the assistance of counsel a\n\npetition in district court challenging the process as violating his privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination. Harkins claims if he participates in the SOTP\n\nand makes the required disclosures, he could be criminally prosecuted\n\nfor perjury because of his testimony in the underlying criminal trial.\n\nHarkins further asserts that the admissions required in the SOTP could\n\nbe used against him in a subsequent trial on the underlying offense if he\n\nis granted a new trial on postconviction relief.     He claims that he is\n\nentitled to use immunity.       In the district court, he did not identify\n\nwhether he was proceeding under the Federal or State Constitution.\n\f                                     29\n\n      The district court granted Harkins’s application in part and denied\n\nit in part. Harkins filed a writ of certiorari. In his pro se briefing, he\n\ndeclared that he was proceeding based on “the Fifth Amendment right\n\nagainst self-incrimination . . . and [the] right to due process.”\n\n      II. Analysis Under Federal Constitution.\n\n      A. Background to Fifth Amendment.              The Fifth Amendment\n\nprovides that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to\n\nbe a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. A brief review of\n\nthe historical background of the Fifth Amendment provides the context of\n\nmy consideration of this case.\n\n      After the Norman Conquest, ecclesiastical courts were established\n\nto settle disputes. Leonard W. Levy, Origins of the Fifth Amendment: The\n\nRight Against Self-Incrimination 43 (Macmillan Publ’g Co., 2d ed. 1986)\n\n[hereinafter Levy]. These courts were inquisitorial in nature. Id. at 45.\n\nPersons were forced to appear and subject themselves to general\n\nexamination under oath without knowledge of the charges being\n\ninvestigated. Id.; Stefan J. Padfield, Self-Incrimination and Acceptance of\n\nResponsibility in Prison Sex Offender Treatment Programs, 49 U. Kan. L.\n\nRev. 487, 491 (2001). The most infamous of these courts was the “Star\n\nChamber.” See Mark A. Godsey, Rethinking the Involuntary Confession\n\nRule: Toward A Workable Test for Identifying Compelled Self-Incrimination,\n\n93 Cal. L. Rev. 465, 481 (2005).\n\n      Star Chamber proceedings were classic fishing expeditions in\n\nwhich interrogators could roam far and wide in an attempt to establish\n\nmisconduct of persons under examination.          See Akhil Reed Amar &\n\nRenee B. Lettow, Fifth Amendment Principles:          The Self-Incrimination\n\nClause, 93 Mich. L. Rev. 857, 896 (1995); Kenworthey Bilz, Self-\n\nIncrimination Doctrine Is Dead; Long Live Self-Incrimination Doctrine:\n\f                                    30\n\nConfessions, Scientific Evidence, and the Anxieties of the Liberal State, 30\n\nCardozo L. Rev. 807, 846 (2008).     A person appearing before the Star\n\nChamber had no notice of charges and was forced, under oath, to answer\n\nany and all questions. Levy at 50–51; 8 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence\n\nin Trials at Common Law § 2250, at 278 & n.43 (McNaughton rev. ed.\n\n1961). The Star Chamber presented the target with a classic Hobson’s\n\nchoice: answer questions and incriminate yourself or do not answer\n\nquestions and be punished for your silence.\n\n      Common     law   courts   eventually   supplanted   the   ecclesiastic\n\nauthorities and rejected, in large part, the inquisitorial approach. David\n\nHeim, Note, Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don’t—Why Minnesota’s\n\nPrison-Based Sex Offender Treatment Program Violates the Right Against\n\nSelf-Incrimination, 32 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 1217, 1226 (2006).             At\n\ncommon law, in addition to a right to be free from compelled testimony,\n\nan affirmative right to remain silent developed—a right that was\n\nrecognized both in court proceedings and in interrogations by agents of\n\nthe state. Id. These restrictions, however, were mere rules of evidence.\n\n      State constitutions enacted after the American Revolution, but\n\nprior to the constitutional convention, embraced the right against self-\n\nincrimination as a constitutional norm.        For example, the Virginia\n\nDeclaration of Rights provided “in all capital or criminal prosecutions a\n\nman . . . cannot . . . be compelled to give evidence against himself.” Levy\n\nat 405–06. The framers relied on these state constitutional precedents in\n\nfashioning the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id. at\n\n409. While it is commonly believed that state constitutional provisions\n\nwere modeled after the Federal Constitution, the opposite is generally\n\ntrue with respect to the Fifth Amendment. See id.\n\f                                     31\n\n      The purposes of the Fifth Amendment have been discussed in\n\nnumerous cases in both state and federal courts.              In Murphy v.\n\nWaterfront Commission of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S. Ct. 1594,\n\n12 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1964), the United States Supreme Court stated that\n\nthe Fifth Amendment:\n      [R]eflects . . . our unwillingness to subject those suspected of\n      crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or\n      contempt; our preference for an accusatorial rather than an\n      inquisitorial system of criminal justice; . . . our sense of fair\n      play which dictates a fair state-individual balance by\n      requiring the government to leave the individual alone until\n      good cause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring the\n      government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the\n      entire load; . . . our distru[s]t of self-deprecatory statements;\n      and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes a\n      shelter to the guilty, is often a protection to the innocent.\n\nMurphy, 378 U.S. at 55, 84 S. Ct. at 1596–97, 12 L. Ed. 2d at 681\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n      B. Framework for Resolution of Fifth Amendment Issues.\n\nWhile murky on the edges, the United States Supreme Court has\n\nestablished a general framework for analysis of Fifth Amendment issues.\n\nIt is well established that the Fifth Amendment applies in any\n\nproceeding, criminal or civil, in which officials seek answers that might\n\nincriminate the party providing the responses in future criminal\n\nproceedings. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S. Ct. 316, 322, 38\n\nL. Ed. 2d 274, 281 (1973).      There is thus no dispute that requiring\n\nstatements from a prisoner as part of a sex offender treatment program\n\nis within the scope of proceedings where the protections of the Fifth\n\nAmendment apply.\n\n      In addition, while the Fifth Amendment privilege is not always self-\n\nexecuting, United States v. Monia, 317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S. Ct. 409, 410–\n\n11, 87 L. Ed. 376, 380 (1943), the facts establish that Harkins timely\n\f                                    32\n\nasserted the privilege.      He has refused to participate in the SOTP\n\nexplicitly on self-incrimination grounds.\n\n      Finally, while the Fifth Amendment applies only where the\n\nstatements sought by the state might incriminate the person asserting\n\nthe privilege in future criminal proceedings, Lefkowitz, 414 U.S. at 77, 94\n\nS. Ct. at 322, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 281, there is no question in this case that\n\nHarkins meets this threshold requirement. The Iowa SOTP requires that\n\nHarkins accept responsibility for his offenses and behavior without any\n\nassurances of confidentiality or immunity from prosecution if he provides\n\nthe information required.\n\n      The remaining question of Harkins’s Fifth Amendment claim is\n\nwhether the SOTP compels Harkins to make incriminating statements. It\n\nhas generally been held that truly voluntary statements may be admitted\n\nwithout violating the Fifth Amendment.      Garner v. United States, 424\n\nU.S. 648, 654, 96 S. Ct. 1178, 1182, 47 L. Ed. 2d 370, 377 (1976). Even\n\nwhen statements are otherwise the product of compulsion, however, any\n\npotential constitutional infirmity under the Fifth Amendment may be\n\nresolved if the state provides use and derivative-use immunity from\n\nprosecution. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 459–62, 92 S. Ct.\n\n1653, 1664–65, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212, 225–27 (1972).\n\n      In this case, the State of Iowa has given Harkins a choice:\n\nparticipate in a program that requires him to accept full responsibility for\n\nhis offenses and behavior or lose his entitlement to earned-time credits\n\nand stay in prison longer.\n\n      The nub of this case is whether the State of Iowa can force Harkins\n\nto make this choice consistent with the Fifth Amendment or whether the\n\nState must provide Harkins with Kastigar-type immunity from future\n\nprosecution for the program to survive Fifth Amendment review.\n\f                                    33\n\nReaching a decision in this case is made somewhat complex because of a\n\nhighly fractured Supreme Court opinion in a key case involving the Fifth\n\nAmendment rights of prisoners required to participate in sex offender\n\ntherapy programs—McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S. Ct. 2017, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d 47 (2002).\n\n      C. Pre-McKune Development of Fifth Amendment Element of\n\nCompulsion By the United States Supreme Court.\n\n      1. Early cases involving compulsion. Early United States Supreme\n\nCourt cases considered the question of whether statements made by an\n\naccused were compelled under the Fifth Amendment. For instance, in\n\nBrown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 596–97, 16 S. Ct. 644, 647, 40 L. Ed.\n\n819, 821 (1896), the Supreme Court, noting that the Fifth Amendment\n\nwas a protest against inquisitorial methods, observed that the temptation\n      to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid\n      or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and to entrap him\n      into fatal contradictions . . . made the system so odious as to\n      give rise to a demand for its total abolition.\n\nSimilarly, in Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532, 18 S. Ct. 183, 42\n\nL. Ed. 568 (1897), the Supreme Court cited with favor English precedent,\n\nwhich declared: “A confession . . . which is obtained from a defendant,\n\neither by the flattery of hope, or by the impressions of fear, however\n\nslightly the emotions may be implanted is not admissible evidence.”\n\nBram, 168 U.S. at 547, 18 S. Ct. at 188, 42 L. Ed. at 575 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).      The Bram Court noted that\n\nbecause the law cannot measure the precise power of the influence\n\nexerted against the accused, the declaration must be excluded if any\n\ninfluence has been exerted to obtain the statement. Id. at 565, 18 S. Ct.\n\nat 195, 42 L. Ed. at 581.\n\f                                     34\n\n      As late as 1964, in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 7, 84 S. Ct. 1489,\n\n1493, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653, 659 (1964), the Supreme Court observed that\n\nthe Fifth Amendment was the “essential mainstay” of our “American\n\nsystem of criminal prosecution.”          The Court noted that the Fifth\n\nAmendment protected a defendant’s “ ‘free choice to admit, to deny, or to\n\nrefuse to answer’ ” questions posed by the state. Malloy, 378 U.S. at 7,\n\n84 S. Ct. at 1493, 12 L. Ed. 2d at 659 (quoting Lisenba v. California, 314\n\nU.S. 219, 241, 62 S. Ct. 280, 292, 86 L. Ed. 166, 182 (1941)). The Court\n\nfurther stated that it had held inadmissible “a confession secured by so\n\nmild a whip as the refusal . . . to allow a suspect to call his wife until he\n\nconfessed.” Id.\n\n      Plainly, these early cases under the Fifth Amendment were\n\ngenerous to the accused and strongly emphasized the need for liberal\n\nconstruction of the Fifth Amendment in order to protect the underlying\n\nrights of the accused.\n\n      2. Development of concept of penalty and costs. Beginning with\n\nGriffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106\n\n(1965), the Supreme Court began to characterize the issue of compelled\n\ntestimony under the Fifth Amendment in terms of “penalty” or “costs.” In\n\nGriffin, the defendant refused to testify. Griffin, 380 U.S. at 609–10, 85\n\nS. Ct. at 1230, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 107. In closing, the prosecutor argued\n\nthat the jury could draw an adverse inference from this failure. Id. at\n\n610–11, 85 S. Ct. at 1231, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 107–08. The trial court also\n\ninstructed the jury that, while the defendant had a constitutional right\n\nnot to testify, the jury could draw an adverse inference from his failure.\n\nId. at 610, 85 S. Ct. at 1230, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 107. The Supreme Court\n\nheld that the comment of the prosecutor and the trial court instruction\n\nimpermissibly imposed a penalty on the exercise of the constitutional\n\f                                       35\n\nright to remain silent. Id. at 614–15, 85 S. Ct. at 1232–33, 14 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 109–10.     In particular, the Court noted that the prosecution’s\n\ncommentary “cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.”\n\nId. at 614, 85 S. Ct. at 1233, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 110.\n\n      The    Supreme    Court   also    found   threats   of   termination   of\n\nemployment violated the Fifth Amendment because the threatened\n\ndischarge imposed a penalty on the right to remain silent. See Gardner\n\nv. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 279, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 1916, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1082,\n\n1087 (1968); see also Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 497–98, 87\n\nS. Ct. 616, 618–19, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562, 565–66 (1967).           In Garrity, the\n\nCourt emphasized that the protection against coerced statements is a\n\nright “of constitutional stature whose exercise a State may not condition\n\nby the exaction of a price.” Garrity, 385 U.S. at 500, 87 S. Ct. at 620, 17\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 567.\n\n      In a case decided the same day as Garrity, the Supreme Court, in\n\nSpevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 512–13, 87 S. Ct. 625, 626–27, 17\n\nL. Ed. 2d 574, 576 (1967), considered a case in which an attorney was\n\ndisbarred for refusing to testify at a judicial inquiry and failing to comply\n\nwith a subpoena duces tecum calling for the production of financial\n\nrecords. The Spevack Court noted that a penalty “is not restricted to a\n\nfine or imprisonment” and includes “the imposition of any sanction\n\nwhich makes assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege ‘costly.’ ”\n\nSpevack, 385 U.S. at 515, 87 S. Ct. at 628, 17 L. Ed. 2d at 577 (quoting\n\nGriffin, 380 U.S. at 614, 85 S. Ct. at 1233, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 110). The\n\nCourt continued, warning:\n\n           “It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest\n      and   least    repulsive    form;    but     illegitimate  and\n      unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way,\n      namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal\n\f                                   36\n      modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering\n      to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of\n      person and property should be liberally construed. A close\n      and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy,\n      and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it\n      consisted more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of\n      courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the\n      citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.”\n\nId. (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S. Ct. 524, 535,\n\n29 L. Ed. 746, 752 (1886), abrogated on other grounds by Warden v.\n\nHayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S. Ct. 1642, 18 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1967)).\n\nSimilarly, in Uniformed Sanitation Men Association v. Commissioner of\n\nSanitation, 392 U.S. 280, 283–84, 88 S. Ct. 1917, 1919, 20 L. Ed. 2d\n\n1089, 1092–93 (1968), the Supreme Court held that the discharge of\n\npublic employees for invoking and refusing to waive the privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, during an investigation of the employees, violated the\n\nemployees’ Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n      In Lefkowitz, the Supreme Court considered whether the potential\n\nloss of business contracts for licensed architects constituted a penalty\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment. Lefkowitz, 414 U.S. at 71–73, 94 S. Ct. at\n\n320–21, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 278–80. In Lefkowitz, the Court emphasized the\n\nrole of immunity in overcoming potential Fifth Amendment objections.\n\nId. at 84–85, 94 S. Ct. at 325–26, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 285–86. According to\n\nthe majority, employees must be offered “whatever immunity is required\n\nto supplant the privilege” and may not be required to “waive such\n\nimmunity.” Id. at 85, 94 S. Ct. at 326, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 286. In Kastigar,\n\nthe Supreme Court determined that use and derivative-use immunity\n\nwas sufficient to satisfy Fifth Amendment concerns arising from\n\notherwise compelled testimony. Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 458, 92 S. Ct. at\n\n1664, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 225.\n\f                                   37\n\n      3. Pre-McKune penalty cases involving Fifth Amendment rights of\n\npersons convicted of crimes. The first case in which the United States\n\nSupreme Court considered the issue of compelled testimony under the\n\nFifth Amendment in the context of prisoners was Baxter v. Palmigiano,\n\n425 U.S. 308, 96 S. Ct. 1551, 47 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1976). In Baxter, the\n\nmajority held that permitting adverse inferences to be drawn from an\n\ninmate’s silence at a disciplinary proceeding was not, on its face, an\n\ninvalid practice. Baxter, 425 U.S. at 320, 96 S. Ct. at 1559, 47 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 822.   The majority emphasized that the inmate’s silence at the\n\ndisciplinary hearing was in and of itself insufficient to support an\n\nadverse disciplinary decision. Id. at 317, 96 S. Ct. at 1557, 47 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 821.   As a result, the Court emphasized that “the case is very\n\ndifferent” from the Garrity-Lefkowitz decisions, “where refusal to submit\n\nto interrogation and to waive [a] Fifth Amendment privilege, standing\n\nalone and without regard to other evidence, resulted in loss of\n\nemployment or opportunity to contract with the State.” Id. at 318, 96\n\nS. Ct. at 1557–58, 47 L. Ed. 2d at 821 (emphasis added).\n\n      The Court next confronted a Fifth Amendment question in the\n\ncontext of probation. In Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 422, 104\n\nS. Ct. 1136, 1139, 79 L. Ed. 2d 409, 416 (1984), a probationer was\n\nrequired, as a condition of probation, to regularly meet with his\n\nprobation officer.   During his required appearance, the probationer\n\nadmitted that he committed a rape and murder. Murphy, 465 U.S. at\n\n424, 104 S. Ct. at 1140, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 417. After a grand jury returned\n\nan indictment for murder, the probationer sought to suppress the\n\nincriminating statements on Fifth Amendment grounds. Id. at 425, 104\n\nS. Ct. at 1141, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 417. The Supreme Court, under the facts\n\npresented, held that there was no Fifth Amendment violation because the\n\f                                           38\n\nprobationer did not timely assert his Fifth Amendment privilege during\n\nthe interview with the probation officer. Id. at 440, 104 S. Ct. at 1149,\n\n79 L. Ed. 2d at 428. The Supreme Court majority repeatedly framed the\n\nissue as one of “waiver” and “timely” assertion of Fifth Amendment\n\nrights.    Id. at 428–29, 437–40, 104 S. Ct. at 1142–43, 1147–49, 79\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 420, 426–28.\n\n       The Murphy Court distinguished the penalty cases. While a timely\n\nassertion of Fifth Amendment privileges was not required in penalty\n\ncases, the Murphy Court noted that the state did not impose a penalty\n\nbecause the probationer was only required to appear before his probation\n\nofficer and discuss matters concerning probation. Id. at 435, 104 S. Ct.\n\nat 1146, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 424. The state did not require the probationer\n\nto surrender his Fifth Amendment privilege or face a penalty. Id. at 436–\n\n37, 104 S. Ct. at 1147, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 425–26.                   Once the probation\n\nofficer exercised his discretion to ask questions requiring the probationer\n\nto provide potentially incriminating answers, the probationer was\n\nrequired to assert the privilege. Id. at 437–38, 104 S. Ct. at 1147–48, 79\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 426–27. At that point, the state would have the option of\n\ndropping the inquiry or providing immunity sufficient to address the\n\nprivilege. 5 Id. at 435 n.7, 104 S. Ct. at 1146 n.7, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 425\n\nn.7.\n\n       The Murphy Court emphasized, however, that the probationer did\n\nnot lose his Fifth Amendment protection simply because he had been\n\n\n       5Justice   Marshall, joined by Justice Stevens in part and by Justice Brennan,\ndissented. The dissent recognized that the key issue in the case was whether the\nprobationer was required to timely assert the privilege or whether the privilege was self-\nexecuting. Murphy, 465 U.S. at 442, 104 S. Ct. at 1150, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 429 (Marshall,\nJ., dissenting) (asserting that the flaw in the majority’s approach lies not in analysis of\nconstitutional rights, but in finding that rights were not violated in this case because of\nMurphy’s failure to assert privilege).\n\f                                    39\n\nconvicted of a prior crime. Id. at 426, 104 S. Ct. at 1141, 79 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n418. Further, the Murphy Court implied that the outcome would have\n\nbeen different if the probationer had timely invoked his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivileges. See id. at 435, 104 S. Ct. at 1146, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 424–25. As\n\nnoted by the Murphy Court:\n      There is . . . a substantial basis in our cases for concluding\n      that if the State, either expressly or by implication, asserts\n      that invocation of the privilege would lead to revocation of\n      probation, it would have created the classic penalty\n      situation, the failure to assert the privilege would be\n      excused, and the probationer’s answers would be deemed\n      compelled and inadmissible in a criminal prosecution.\n\nId. Plainly, Murphy turned on the fact that the probationer waived his\n\nFifth Amendment rights by responding to the probation officer’s\n\nquestions. See id. at 429, 104 S. Ct. at 1143, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 420.\n\n      In Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 277, 118\n\nS. Ct. 1244, 1248, 140 L. Ed. 2d 387, 394 (1998), a state prisoner\n\nsentenced to death alleged that Ohio’s clemency statute violated his Fifth\n\nAmendment right to remain silent. The prisoner claimed that there was\n\na substantial risk of incrimination because postconviction proceedings\n\nwere in progress and also because he could potentially incriminate\n\nhimself on other crimes at the clemency interview. Woodard, 523 U.S. at\n\n285, 118 S. Ct. at 1252, 140 L. Ed. 2d at 399. Though the Supreme\n\nCourt was highly divided on a number of issues, it unanimously held\n\nthat giving an inmate the option of voluntarily participating in an\n\ninterview as part of the clemency process does not offend the Fifth\n\nAmendment. Id. at 287–88, 118 S. Ct. at 1253, 140 L. Ed. 2d at 400–01.\n\nAccording to the Court, the prisoner failed to establish that his testimony\n\nat a clemency hearing would be “compelled” under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nId. at 286, 118 S. Ct. at 1252, 140 L. Ed. 2d at 399–400. The choice of\n\f                                       40\n\nwhether to participate in a clemency hearing, according to the Court, was\n\nno different than the choice to take the stand in a criminal case. Id. at\n\n286–87, 118 S. Ct. at 1252–53, 140 L. Ed. 2d at 400.                No automatic\n\nsanction attached to the refusal to participate in the clemency hearing\n\nother than potential impact on the clemency hearing itself. See id.\n\n      D. Pre-McKune         Case     Law    Regarding   Fifth       Amendment\n\nImplications of Sex Offender Therapy Programs.\n\n      1. Approach of lower federal courts and state courts.             Prior to\n\nMcKune, the results of court challenges to required sex offender\n\ntreatment programs were mixed. In Mace v. Amestoy, 765 F. Supp. 847,\n\n850–51 (D. Vt. 1991), a federal district court held that the Fifth\n\nAmendment is violated when a sex offender is required to disclose past\n\nmisconduct as a condition of probation or a court-suspended sentence.\n\nThe Mace court distinguished Murphy on the ground that the probationer\n\nin Mace was required to detail sexual history, not simply make truthful\n\nstatements to a probation officer. Mace, 765 F. Supp. at 851. Thus, in\n\nMace, the court concluded that the privilege was self-executing and\n\nplaced the petitioner in a “classic penalty” situation. Id. The Mace court\n\nrecognized the legitimate state interest in rehabilitation, but observed\n\nthat citizens cannot be forced to incriminate themselves merely because\n\nit advances a governmental need. Id. at 852; see also State v. Imlay, 813\n\nP.2d 979, 985 (Mont. 1991) (finding “the better reasoned decisions are\n\nthose decisions which protect the defendant’s constitutional right against\n\nself-incrimination,   and    which    prohibit   augmenting     a    defendant’s\n\nsentence because he refuses to confess to a crime or invokes his privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination”).\n\n      Other courts, however, were less sympathetic to claims of Fifth\n\nAmendment violations in the context of sex offender treatment programs.\n\f                                   41\n\nSome courts refused to grant relief on factual grounds. For instance, in\n\nDoe v. Sauer, 186 F.3d 903, 906 (8th Cir. 1999), the Eighth Circuit held\n\nan Iowa sex offender was not entitled to relief in a § 1983 action on the\n\nground that he was denied parole because of his refusal to incriminate\n\nhimself as required by Iowa authorities as part of a sex offender\n\ntreatment program. The Doe court emphasized, however, that Doe had\n\nfailed to provide any factual evidence that he was denied parole based\n\nupon his exercise of Fifth Amendment rights and not solely based upon\n\nthe seriousness of the offense or          his refusal to participate in\n\nrehabilitation. Doe, 186 F.3d at 905–06.\n\n      On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Minnesota in State ex rel.\n\nMorrow v. LaFleur, 590 N.W.2d 787, 792 (Minn. 1999), abrogated by\n\nJohnson v. Fabian, 735 N.W.2d 295, 305 (Minn. 2007), considered\n\nwhether a Minnesota sex offender therapy program requiring participants\n\nto admit the conduct for which they were convicted violated the Fifth\n\nAmendment. While the majority noted that an offender who declined to\n\nparticipate was denied early release from prison, it drew a distinction\n\nbetween early release from one’s sentence, which was not a penalty\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment, and revocation of probation, which was\n\nsuch a penalty.    Morrow, 590 N.W.2d at 793.       The Morrow majority\n\nopinion, however, drew a sharp dissent which found the distinction\n\nunpersuasive and noted the fact that the State of Minnesota had a\n\nlegitimate interest in rehabilitating sex offenders had nothing to do with\n\nthe question of whether the admissions in Minnesota’s sex therapy\n\nprogram were compelled. Id. at 797–98 (Page, J., dissenting).\n\n      At least one pre-McKune court, however, focused on whether denial\n\nof parole or probation automatically followed the exercise of Fifth\n\nAmendment rights in sex therapy programs. In Ainsworth v. Risley, 244\n\f                                     42\n\nF.3d 209 (lst Cir. 2001), the court attempted to reconcile potentially\n\ninconsistent cases by noting the distinction between cases where the\n\ndenial of parole was automatic and those where the denial of parole\n\nrested in the discretion of prison authorities. Risley, 244 F.3d at 220,\n\nvacated by Ainsworth v. Stanley, 536 U.S. 953, 122 S. Ct. 2652, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d 829 (2002) (judgment vacated and case remanded for further\n\nconsideration in light of McKune).\n\n      2. Approach of lower federal courts to Fifth Amendment implications\n\nof sex therapy programs in McKune. In Lile v. McKune, 24 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1152, 1155 (D. Kan. 1998), the federal district court considered whether\n\na   Kansas   prison-based   sex   therapy   program    violated   the   Fifth\n\nAmendment rights of a prisoner, Robert Lile, who had been convicted of\n\nsex offenses.   At the time of his challenge, Lile had a pending habeas\n\ncorpus petition attacking his state court conviction.         McKune, 24\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 1154. Although he was not required to participate in a\n\nsex offender therapy program at the beginning of his incarceration, Lile’s\n\nprison counselor added the program to Lile’s inmate program agreement.\n\nId. at 1154–55.   After an unsuccessful administrative challenge to the\n\naddition of the program, Lile signed the modified program, but refused to\n\nparticipate in sex offender treatment in part because it required him to\n\nsign an “Admission of Guilt” form. Id. at 1155. He also objected to a\n\nprogram requirement that he provide a written sexual history of all his\n\nprior sexual activities, including uncharged criminal offenses. Id.\n\n      The consequence of failure to participate in the program included\n\ntransfer to a maximum security setting.      Id.   In a maximum security\n\nsetting, Lile would not have access to a personal television.         Id.   In\n\naddition, Lile would be placed in a more dangerous environment and\n\nwould not be able to earn more than $0.60 a day for prison pay.             Id.\n\f                                     43\n\nRestrictions would also be placed on visitation.         Id.   Further, the\n\nmaximum security setting limited the programming available to Lile as\n\nwell as the amount of personal property Lile could keep in his cell. Id.\n\n      The district court found that Lile’s Fifth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated. Id. at 1158. The district court found that, under the Kansas\n\nscheme, unlike that presented in Woodard, automatic sanctions were\n\nimposed for the assertion of Fifth Amendment rights. Id. Although the\n\nautomatic sanctions did not arise to a protected “liberty” interest, there\n\nwas no requirement that a liberty interest be implicated in order to\n\nestablish compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 1159.\n\n      On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\n\naffirmed. Lile v. McKune, 224 F.3d 1175, 1189 (10th Cir. 2000). At the\n\noutset, the court noted that a refusal to participate in the program did\n\nnot automatically disqualify an inmate from parole and did not lead to a\n\nloss of good-time credits. Id. at 1182. The only automatic sanction was\n\nthe transfer from medium security to a maximum security setting and\n\nthe resulting adverse consequences flowing from the transfer. Id.\n\n      Like the district court, however, the Tenth Circuit rejected the\n\nargument that a “liberty” interest must be implicated in order to\n\nestablish compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.          Id. at 1184.    The\n\nTenth Circuit agreed with the district court that “ ‘by grafting a protected\n\nliberty interest to a finding of compulsion, the standard is set too high.’ ”\n\nId. at 1184 (quoting McKune, 24 F. Supp. 2d at 1159). The Tenth Circuit\n\nnoted that the Supreme Court had held that threat of disbarment,\n\ndamage to professional reputation, and loss of income amounted to\n\nimpermissible compulsion without an explicit characterization of the\n\ndeprivations as protected liberty interests. Id.\n\f                                        44\n\n        The Tenth Circuit distinguished the case from penalty cases where\n\nthe Supreme Court had not found a Fifth Amendment violation. Id. at\n\n1186.     The Tenth Circuit thus found the case distinguishable from\n\nBaxter, in which silence was simply a factor that might be considered in\n\na prison disciplinary hearing, but did not involve any automatic adverse\n\nconsequences. Id. The court also distinguished Woodard by noting that,\n\nwhile the inmate who refuses to participate in a clemency proceeding\n\nmay affect his chances of receiving clemency, Woodard involved no\n\n“separate and distinct substantial or potent consequences” that were\n\nautomatically imposed by his refusal to participate. Id. at 1187. Finally,\n\nthe court noted that, in Murphy, the plaintiff was not actually required to\n\nmake incriminating statements. Id.\n\n        Although the Tenth Circuit determined that the Kansas policy\n\nimposed penalties that violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, the court nonetheless proceeded to balance Lile’s Fifth\n\nAmendment       right   against   the    prison’s   penological   interests   in\n\nmaintaining the program under the four-factor test established in Turner\n\nv. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89–90, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2262, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64,\n\n79–80 (1987). Id. at 1190. While the court determined that the Kansas\n\nprogram was rationally connected to legitimate governmental interests in\n\nrehabilitation and public safety, it found that Lile had no alternative\n\nmeans of exercising his Fifth Amendment right. Id. at 1191. The court\n\nalso concluded that accommodation of the Fifth Amendment right would\n\nnot have a negative effect on guards, other prisoners, or prison\n\nresources. Id. Further, and most importantly, the court reasoned that\n\nthe grant of use immunity or some form of privilege was an “obvious,\n\neasy alternative” to save the program from constitutional infirmity. Id. at\n\n1191–92.\n\f                                    45\n\n      E. Approach    of   United    States   Supreme    Court    to    Fifth\n\nAmendment Implications of Sex Offender Therapy Programs in\n\nMcKune. After the Tenth Circuit decided the case, the Supreme Court\n\ngranted the state’s petition for writ of certiorari and reversed. McKune,\n\n536 U.S. at 48, 122 S. Ct. at 2032, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66 (Kennedy, J.,\n\nplurality opinion). Justice Kennedy wrote a plurality opinion joined by\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas.          Justice\n\nKennedy concluded that Lile was not impermissibly compelled to\n\nincriminate himself and, therefore, was not entitled to use immunity. Id.\n\nat 35–36, 122 S. Ct. at 2025–26, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 58–59.              Justice\n\nStevens, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsberg, and Breyer, dissented. Id.\n\nat 54, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 70 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\nJustice Stevens declared that, without a grant of use immunity, the\n\nKansas program would violate the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 69–72, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2043–45, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 80–81. Justice O’Connor wrote a\n\nconcurring opinion that joined in the result reached by Justice Kennedy.\n\nId. at 54, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66 (O’Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring). Because Justice O’Connor’s opinion provided a fifth vote in\n\nsupport of the judgment, the Supreme Court denied Lile relief. See id.\n\n      In his plurality opinion, Justice Kennedy repeatedly emphasized\n\nthat the gravity of the consequences of declining to participate in the\n\nKansas program did not amount to compelled testimony under the Fifth\n\nAmendment.      Justice   Kennedy    characterized   “the   incentives”   as\n\n“minimal.” Id. at 29, 122 S. Ct. at 2022, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 54 (plurality\n\nopinion).   He stressed that the consequences of a transfer to the\n\nmaximum security unit were not ones that compel a prisoner to testify\n\nabout past crimes. Id. at 36, 122 S. Ct. at 2026, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 58.\n\nJustice Kennedy observed that the decision regarding where to house an\n\f                                       46\n\ninmate was at the core of prison administrators’ expertise. Id. at 39, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2027, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 60.\n\n      In reaching his conclusions, Justice Kennedy utilized a due\n\nprocess test developed by the Court in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n\n115 S. Ct. 2293, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995). Id. at 37, 122 S. Ct. at 2026–\n\n27, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 59–60. In Sandin, the Supreme Court held that a\n\nprisoner did not have a liberty interest for purposes of procedural due\n\nprocess in the terms and conditions of confinement unless they\n\nconstituted “atypical and significant hardship[s] on the inmate in relation\n\nto the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484, 115\n\nS. Ct. at 2300, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 430. Justice Kennedy found that the\n\nSandin framework provided “a reasonable means of assessing whether\n\nthe response of prison administrators to correctional and rehabilitative\n\nnecessities are so out of the ordinary that one could sensibly say they\n\nrise to the level of unconstitutional compulsion.” McKune, 536 U.S. at\n\n41, 122 S. Ct. at 2029, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 62 (plurality opinion).\n\n      Justice Kennedy wrote that determining compulsion was a\n\nquestion of judgment. Id. at 41, 122 S. Ct. at 2028, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 62.\n\nHe found the administrative harms de minimis when compared to the\n\nharms in Murphy, Woodard, and Baxter.           Id. at 42–43, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2029–30, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 63. Yet, Justice Kennedy pointedly noted that\n\nthe Kansas program “did not extend [Lile’s] term of incarceration,” nor\n\ndid it “affect [Lile’s] eligibility for good-time credits or parole.” Id. at 38,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 2027, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 60.\n\n      Justice    Stevens’s   dissent    emphasized     the   Court’s   historic\n\ntreatment of the Fifth Amendment and asserted that the Fifth\n\nAmendment guaranteed the right to remain silent unless one chose to\n\nspeak “ ‘in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no\n\f                                    47\n\npenalty’ ” for such silence.   Id. at 56–58, 122 S. Ct. at 2037, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 72 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting Malloy, 378 U.S. at 8,\n\n84 S. Ct. at 1493–94, 12 L. Ed. 2d at 659). He challenged the plurality’s\n\ntreatment of Woodard, Baxter, and Murphy, noting that each turned not\n\non the seriousness of the consequences but on other flaws in the\n\nasserted Fifth Amendment claims. Id. at 59–62, 122 S. Ct. at 2038–40,\n\n153 L. Ed. 2d at 73–75.\n\n      Justice Stevens characterized as “wholly unpersuasive” the notion\n\nthat the consequences suffered by Lile for invoking his Fifth Amendment\n\nrights were so insignificant as to not trigger Fifth Amendment\n\nprotections. Id. at 64, 122 S. Ct. at 2041, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 77. Justice\n\nStevens emphasized that the coerciveness of changes in prison\n\nconditions must be measured “not by comparing the quality of life in a\n\nprison environment with that in a free society, but rather by the contrast\n\nbetween the favored and disfavored classes of prisoners.” Id. at 67, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2042–43, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 79. According to Justice Stevens, it\n\nwas plain that the aggregate effect of the change in prison environment\n\namounted to compulsion. Id.\n\n      Finally, Justice Stevens criticized the balancing approach in the\n\nplurality opinion.   Citing Lefkowitz, he noted that the Court had\n\npreviously rejected the notion that citizens may be forced to incriminate\n\nthemselves because it served a governmental need.       Id. at 68–69, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2043, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 79–80. He noted that the state could\n\nfurther its goals by granting use immunity or by establishing a voluntary\n\nprogram. Id. at 69–71, 122 S. Ct. at 2043–45, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 80–81.\n\nNo matter what the goal, however, Justice Stevens wrote that inmates\n\nshould not be compelled to forfeit the privilege against self-incrimination\n\n“simply because the ends are legitimate or because they have been\n\f                                     48\n\nconvicted of sex offenses.” Id. at 71, 122 S. Ct. at 2045, 153 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n81.\n\n      Justice O’Connor wrote that the standard for Fifth Amendment\n\ncompulsion is broader than the “atypical and significant hardship”\n\nstandard adopted in prison due process cases. Id. at 48, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2032, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66–67 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Yet, she did\n\nnot find the “alterations in respondent’s prison conditions” so great as to\n\nconstitute compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.         Id. at 48–49, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2032–33, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66–67.         Instead, she found the\n\nalterations to be “minor” and that, while the conditions may have made\n\nthe prison experience “more unpleasant,” imposition of the conditions\n\nwere “very unlikely to actually compel [Lile] to incriminate himself.” Id.\n\nat 51, 122 S. Ct. at 2034, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 68. Regarding the transfer\n\nfrom a medium to maximum security area, Justice O’Connor noted that\n\nthere were no findings about how great a danger arose from such a\n\nplacement. Id.\n\n      But Justice O’Connor wrote that she did not believe penalties\n\ncould include longer incarceration or execution. Id. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2034–35, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69.        According to Justice O’Connor, the\n\nimposition of such outcomes for refusing to incriminate oneself would\n\nsurely implicate a “liberty” interest. Id. The logical implication of Justice\n\nO’Connor’s concurrence is that, while a “liberty” interest is not a\n\nprerequisite for stating a Fifth Amendment compulsion claim, the\n\nsacrifice of a protected “liberty” interest would, at minimum, raise\n\nserious difficulties under the Fifth Amendment. See id.\n\n      Wholly absent from Justice O’Connor’s opinion is the notion of\n\nbalancing the Fifth Amendment rights of a prisoner against legitimate\n\ninterests of the state.   Her opinion focuses solely on what constitutes\n\f                                   49\n\ncompulsion under the Fifth Amendment.        A majority of the Supreme\n\nCourt has not embraced the balancing approach in Justice Kennedy’s\n\nplurality opinion.\n\n      F. Federal Case Law Subsequent to McKune.           Subsequent to\n\nMcKune, federal courts have considered Fifth Amendment claims by\n\nprisoners in a number of contexts.      Shortly after McKune, the Tenth\n\nCircuit decided Searcy v. Simmons, 299 F.3d 1220 (10th Cir. 2002). In\n\nSearcy, the facts differed from McKune in that the prisoner claimed that\n\nhis good-time credits were impacted when he refused to incriminate\n\nhimself in a sex offender therapy program. Searcy, 299 F.3d at 1223.\n\nThe Searcy court concluded that, because the prisoner did not lose\n\nguaranteed good-time credits due to his refusal to participate in the sex\n\noffender therapy program, there was no constitutional violation. Id. at\n\n1226; see also Wirsching v. Colorado, 360 F.3d 1191, 1203–04 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (no Fifth Amendment violation where loss of good-time credits is\n\ndiscretionary).\n\n      Similarly, in Entzi v. Redmann, 485 F.3d 998, 1000 (8th Cir. 2007),\n\nthe Eighth Circuit considered a Fifth Amendment claim by a prisoner\n\nwhose supervised probation was conditioned on participation in a sex\n\noffender program. While in prison, Entzi refused to comply with a state\n\ncourt order that he participate in a sex offender education class as a\n\ncondition of probation.   Entzi, 485 F.3d at 1000.     The state filed a\n\npetition to revoke Entzi’s probation based upon his failure to complete\n\nthe program, but the state court dismissed the petition because it\n\nconcluded that the program violated the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 1002.\n\nEntzi brought a § 1983 action claiming that the state violated the Fifth\n\nAmendment by filing the revocation petition and withholding his good-\n\ntime credits for failing to participate in sex offender treatment.   Id. at\n\f                                        50\n\n1001. The district court granted summary judgment and judgment on\n\nthe pleadings against Entzi, and Entzi appealed. Id. at 1001, 1003.\n\n        The Eighth Circuit denied relief.      Id. at 1004.    On the issue of\n\nprobation, the court noted that the only consequence of the refusal to\n\nparticipate in the sex offender treatment program was the filing of a\n\nprobation revocation petition, which the district court refused to grant.\n\nId. at 1002. The mere filing of a petition, according to the Eighth Circuit,\n\nwas not sufficient compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.              Id.   With\n\nrespect to the good-time credit issue, the Eighth Circuit noted that, as in\n\nSearcy, there was no automatic revocation of good-time credits. Id. at\n\n1004.     Instead, the North Dakota Department of Corrections had\n\ndiscretionary authority to order, or not to order, such reductions. Id.\n\n        The Ninth Circuit faced a situation different than that in Searcy\n\nand Entzi in United States v. Antelope, 395 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\nAntelope was a convicted sex offender who was made an offer of\n\nsupervised release from prison. Antelope, 395 F.3d at 1130. The offer\n\nwas conditioned, however, upon participation in a sex offender therapy\n\nprogram where he was required to submit to polygraph examinations\n\ndetailing his sexual history.     Id.     Antelope refused to submit to the\n\npolygraphs on Fifth Amendment grounds because of the risk that he\n\nmight reveal past crimes that could lead to his prosecution. Id. at 1130.\n\nIn response, the state twice revoked his conditional liberty and sent him\n\nback to prison. Id. at 1131. In Antelope, the Ninth Circuit reviewed the\n\nestablished Fifth Amendment case law and proceeded to analyze two\n\nprongs     required   to   successfully      invoke   the   Fifth   Amendment:\n\nincrimination and compulsion. Id. at 1134.\n\n        With respect to incrimination, the Ninth Circuit found that the risk\n\nwas “real and appreciable.” Id. at 1135. Antelope was required to detail\n\f                                    51\n\nhis sexual history to a probation officer and submit to “full disclosure”\n\npolygraph examinations verifying his sexual history.         Id.     The sex\n\noffender therapy counselor testified that if Antelope revealed past sex\n\noffenses, he would turn over the evidence to prosecutorial authorities.\n\nId.   The counselor further testified that in the past his reports had\n\nresulted in convictions. Id. The disclosure form Antelope was required\n\nto sign specifically authorized the counselor to make such reports. Id.\n\n      The Ninth Circuit next turned to the compulsion prong. The court\n\nnoted while Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion in McKune rejected\n\nreliance on “the so-called penalty cases,” Justice O’Connor’s concurring\n\nopinion found only that the penalties involved in McKune were not severe\n\nenough. Id. at 1136. The court further observed that Justice O’Connor\n\nrejected the notion that “ ‘penalties [like] longer incarceration’ ” were\n\ninsufficient to trigger Fifth Amendment protection. Id. at 1137 (quoting\n\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2034, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n      Following Justice O’Connor’s opinion, the Ninth Circuit held that\n\nthe state could not sanction Antelope for his silence about other crimes.\n\nId.   Although the court recognized that the state had a legitimate\n\npurpose, the court stated that “[t]he irreconcilable constitutional problem\n\n. . . is that even though the disclosures sought here may serve a valid\n\nrehabilitative purpose, they also may be starkly incriminating.”       Id. at\n\n1138. As a result, the Ninth Circuit found that Antelope was entitled to\n\nKastigar immunity. Id. at 1140–41.\n\n      G. Discussion of Fifth Amendment Issue.\n\n      1.   Controlling authority in context of plurality opinions.    Justice\n\nKennedy’s plurality opinion in McKune—which imports the Sandin\n\nframework in determining whether a sex offender treatment program\n\f                                       52\n\nexacts an unconstitutional penalty under the Fifth Amendment—\n\nrepresented a striking departure from Fifth Amendment case law. The\n\napproach of Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion, however, is not\n\ncontrolling in this case. When there is no majority opinion, the holding\n\nof the Supreme Court is expressed by those members of the Court who\n\nconcurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds. Marks v. United\n\nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S. Ct. 990, 993, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260, 266\n\n(1977).    As a result, the standard articulated by Justice O’Connor is\n\ncontrolling.\n\n      2. Application of approach of Supreme Court precedent. The test\n\nestablished by Justice O’Connor’s concurring opinion is less demanding\n\nthan that of Justice Kennedy’s plurality.        The test to be applied by\n\nJustice O’Connor is somewhat opaque, but it is clearly a lower hurdle\n\nthan the “atypical and significant hardship” standard applied in Sandin.\n\nSee McKune, 536 U.S. at 48, 122 S. Ct. at 2032, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 66–67\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).        She stated that the case turned on the\n\n“minor” nature of the change in prison conditions. Id. at 51, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 2034, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 68.         Further, unlike in this case, Justice\n\nO’Connor emphasized that the period of incarceration was not extended.\n\nId. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2034, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69.\n\n      In    addition,   although    not   required   by   Justice   O’Connor’s\n\nconcurring opinion, Harkins has demonstrated he has a “liberty” interest\n\nin his earned-time credits.         In this case, by exercising his Fifth\n\nAmendment right, Harkins is automatically deprived of earned time to\n\nwhich he would be otherwise entitled.         See Iowa Code § 903A.2(1)(a)\n\n(2007).    We have held that a prisoner’s interest in earned time under\n\nsuch a scheme is a liberty interest under Sandin that is afforded due\n\nprocess protection. Reilly v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 783 N.W.2d 490, 495 (Iowa\n\f                                          53\n\n2010). The language in Justice O’Connor’s opinion strongly implies that\n\nthe presence of a “liberty” interest would be problematic under the Fifth\n\nAmendment. See McKune, 536 U.S. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2034–35, 153 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n       Justice O’Connor does state that the proper theory should\n\nrecognize that it is “generally acceptable” to impose risk of punishment\n\n“so long as actual imposition of such punishment is accomplished\n\nthrough a fair criminal process.”          Id. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 69.       But a defendant does not receive “a fair criminal\n\nprocess” in a prosecution in which the defendant’s compelled testimony\n\nis used against him. 6\n\n       My approach is consistent with the evolving federal case law. The\n\nlower federal courts, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, distinguish\n\nbetween loss of earned time at the discretion of prison authorities and\n\nloss of earned time that automatically results from an exercise of Fifth\n\nAmendment rights, both before and after McKune. 7 Compare Antelope,\n\n395 F.3d at 1137–38 (finding compulsion where offer of released\n\nsupervision from prison was conditioned upon revealing past crimes),\n\nand Mace, 765 F. Supp. at 850–51 (finding compulsion where probation\nconditioned on self-incrimination), with Ainsworth, 244 F.3d at 220\n\n(finding no compulsion where parole not automatically denied for failure\n\nto complete course), and Searcy, 299 F.3d at 1226 (finding no\n\n       6If, however, this phraseology in Justice O’Connor’s opinion should be\ninterpreted as broadly as suggested by the majority, then Justice Kennedy’s opinion\nbecomes the narrowest ground. The presence of a “liberty interest” would be sufficient\nunder Justice Kennedy’s opinion to extend Fifth Amendment protection to Harkins. See\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 41, 122 S. Ct. at 2029, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 62 (plurality opinion).\n        7Our decision in In re C.H., 652 N.W.2d 144 (Iowa 2002), is consistent with this\n\ndistinction. In In re C.H., there was no automatic termination of parental rights as a\nresult of the failure of the parent to complete a sex therapy program. In re C.H., 652\nN.W.2d at 150. In re C.H. is thus more akin to Woodard than this case.\n\f                                          54\n\ncompulsion where eligibility for good-time credits vested within the\n\ndiscretion of penal authorities).\n\n       In light of Justice O’Connor’s approach and the developing law in\n\nthe federal appellate courts, I conclude that, under the Fifth Amendment,\n\nthe State of Iowa must provide Harkins with immunity that is\n\ncoextensive with the scope of his Fifth Amendment privilege if it seeks to\n\nsubject Harkins to the loss of earned time if he declines to participate in\n\nthe SOTP.       Under Kastigar, it is clear that use and derivative-use\n\nimmunity       satisfies   this   requirement     for   purposes      of   the   Fifth\n\nAmendment. Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 458, 92 S. Ct. at 1664, 32 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 225.\n\n       In light of this analysis, I conclude that Harkins has established\n\nthat the State imposes an impermissible penalty for the exercise of his\n\nFifth Amendment rights. The State may force Harkins to choose between\n\nwaving his Fifth Amendment rights and losing earned-time credit only if\n\nit provides Harkins with use and derivative-use immunity from\n\nprosecution.\n\n       III. Preservation of State Constitutional Issue.\n\n       Independent state constitutional grounds for the right against self-\n\nincrimination are well established. 8 In a footnote, the majority indicates\n\nthat Harkins has not preserved his state constitutional law claim.\n\n       8See,  e.g., State v. Bowe, 881 P.2d 538, 546–47 (Haw. 1994) (holding under\nHawaii Constitution that coerced confession obtained by private party must be\nexcluded); State v. Isom, 761 P.2d 524, 528–29 (Or. 1988) (holding that Oregon\nConstitution barred impeachment of defendant with prior inconsistent statements\nobtained in violation of Miranda); Commonwealth v. Bussey, 404 A.2d 1309, 1314 (Pa.\n1979) (stating Pennsylvania Constitution requires proof of waiver of Fifth Amendment\nrights beyond a reasonable doubt); Zuliani v. State, 903 S.W.2d 812, 825 (Tex. Ct. App.\n1995) (rejecting federal harmless error rule under Texas Constitution where physical\nviolence applied to obtain confession); State v. Wood, 868 P.2d 70, 82 & n.2 (Utah\n1993), abrogated on other grounds by State v.

State, 693 P.2d 220, 222 (Wyo. 1984)\n\f                                          55\n\n       The issue of whether Harkins preserved his state constitutional\n\nclaim raises a close question. His primitive filings with the district court\n\nmention self-incrimination, but do not identify whether he poses a state\n\nor federal claim.        Ordinarily, when a party generically refers to a\n\nconstitutional claim with both state and federal counterparts but does\n\nnot identify specifically which constitution he or she is proceeding under,\n\nwe will consider the arguments raised under both constitutions. King v.\n\nState, 797 N.W.2d 565, 571 (Iowa 2011).\n\n       This case, however, raises a new procedural issue that we have not\n\nyet confronted.      The majority suggests that Harkins waived his claim\n\nwhen the district court entered a ruling based solely on the Fifth\n\nAmendment and he failed to file a motion under Iowa Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 1.904(2). In Meier v. Senecaut, 641 N.W.2d 532 (Iowa 2002),\n\nwe noted that a motion for enlargement was necessary to preserve error\n\n“ ‘when the district court fails to resolve an issue, claim, or . . . legal\n\ntheory properly submitted for adjudication.’ ” Meier, 641 N.W.2d at 539\n\n(quoting Explore Info. Servs. v. Iowa Ct. Info. Sys., 636 N.W.2d 50, 57\n\n(Iowa 2001)).     Under our cases, it is clear that the district court may\n\nconsider state constitutional claims when a party simply identifies a\n\nconstitutional principle that could have been brought under both\n\nconstitutions. King, 797 N.W.2d at 571. When the district court does\n\nnot consider the state constitutional issue, there is a question as to\n\nwhether the claim is preserved under Meier in the absence of a motion\n\n________________________________\n(holding postarrest silence may not be used against accused under Wyoming\nConstitution). See generally Mary A. Crossley, Note, Miranda and the State Constitution:\nState Courts Take a Stand, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 1693, 1717–30 (1986) (discussing various\nways state courts have departed from federal precedent in interpreting state self-\nincrimination provisions); 2 Jennifer Friesen, State Constitutional Law: Litigating\nIndividual Rights, Claims and Defenses § 12.09, at 12–112 to –115 (LexisNexis, 4th ed.\n2006) (collecting cases).\n\f                                     56\n\nfor enlargement of the district court’s conclusions.         Where a party\n\nclaiming constitutional rights does not distinguish between the Iowa\n\nConstitution and the Federal Constitution, the argument actually made\n\nis applied under both constitutions. Id. As a result, no party has been\n\ndeprived of the opportunity to address a new substantive argument if\n\nMeier error-preservation rules do not apply.\n\n      In this case, however, not only was there a failure to file a motion\n\nfor enlargement after the district court entered a ruling solely on the\n\nfederal constitutional issue, there was a failure at the appellate level as\n\nwell. The State argued that the issue of state constitutional law was not\n\npreserved.    In response, Harkins cited Fifth Amendment cases and\n\ngenerally claimed that his “Fifth Amendment rights and the right to due\n\nprocess” were violated. When faced with an explicit challenge regarding\n\nwhether he adequately raised a state constitutional claim with his vague\n\ndistrict court pleadings, Harkins had an obligation at that point to fish or\n\ncut bait. If he had raised the state constitutional issue in his brief, the\n\nState would then have had an opportunity to reply to his state law\n\nargument. Harkins did not do so, and the majority’s conclusion that we\n\nshould not consider the state law claim in this unusual posture is\n\nprobably correct.\n\n      I am, however, not entirely satisfied with this approach. A pro se\n\nplaintiff is not well schooled in legal niceties. This is not a case involving\n\na prolix pleading where the nature of the claim is impossible to\n\nunderstand.    We know exactly what the factual basis is for the claim.\n\nYet, we have consistently held that where a party raises only a federal or\n\nstate constitutional claim and does not mention or raise in an identifiable\n\nway the parallel constitutional provision, the claim under the parallel\n\nconstitutional provision is not preserved. See, e.g., State v. Palmer, 791\n\f                                      57\n\nN.W.2d 840, 844 (Iowa 2010); State v. Allensworth, 748 N.W.2d 789, 791\n\nn.2 (Iowa 2008); State v. Griffin, 691 N.W.2d 734, 736–37 (Iowa 2005).\n\nWe have further repeatedly stated that pro se litigants are not to be\n\nprovided special treatment in the appellate process. Colvin v. Story Cnty.\n\nBd. of Review, 653 N.W.2d 345, 348 n.1 (Iowa 2002); Johnson v.\n\nNickerson, 542 N.W.2d 506, 513 (Iowa 1996); State v. Walker, 236\n\nN.W.2d 292, 294 (Iowa 1975).          The question of whether we should\n\nreconsider this approach is not before us. As a result, I conclude that\n\nthe majority did not err when it declined to entertain a state\n\nconstitutional challenge on appeal.\n\n      IV. Conclusion.\n\n      For the reasons stated above, I believe the writ requested by\n\nHarkins should be sustained, the State’s writ annulled, and the case\n\nremanded for reinstatement of Harkins’s earned-time credits after\n\nMarch 22, 2009.\n\n      Wiggins and Hecht, JJ., join this dissent.\n\f",

STATE’S WRIT SUSTAINED; HARKINS’S WRIT\n\nANNULLED; CASE REMANDED.\n\n\n\n       Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Jennifer M.

The question presented here is whether section\n\n903A.2(1)(a) violates the Fifth Amendment rights of a convicted sex\n\noffender, when successful completion of the treatment program would\n\nrequire him to acknowledge responsibility for his offense.\n\n      We conclude there is no Fifth Amendment violation.           For the\n\nreasons discussed herein, we believe the State of Iowa may use earned-\n\ntime credits as an incentive for convicted sex offenders to obtain sex\n\noffender   treatment,    even   when     the   treatment     requires   an\n\nacknowledgment of responsibility.\n\n      I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      On March 21, 2006, Robert Harkins was convicted of third-degree\n\nsexual abuse following a jury trial. The court of appeals, in upholding\n\nHarkins’s conviction on direct appeal, summarized the relevant facts as\n\nfollows:\n             On August 27, 2005, Robert Harkins went out\n      drinking with some friends. The group ended up at the\n      home of [the victim]. After a short period of time most of the\n      group left, except for Derrick, Trisha, Harkins, and [the\n      victim]. Derrick, who was [the victim’s] former boyfriend,\n      passed out on the couch. Trisha went to sleep in one of the\n      bedrooms. Harkins laid down in [the victim’s] bedroom in all\n      of his clothes. [The victim] stated she believed Harkins was\n      sleeping or passed out, so she laid down to sleep on the\n      other side of the bed.\n            [The victim] testified Harkins rolled over on top of her,\n      and she told him to get off. Harkins pinned [the victim]\n      down and pulled her clothing off. [The victim] testified she\n      repeatedly told Harkins no, stating, “I told him no. I told\n\f                                     3\n      him to stop.”     Harkins proceeded to engage in sexual\n      intercourse with her. When Harkins stopped she kneed him\n      and pushed him off, then screamed at him that she had said\n      no. Trisha heard [the victim] say, “No, I said no.” Trisha\n      went to investigate, and met [the victim] coming out of her\n      bedroom, clad only in a blanket and crying hysterically.\n      Trisha stated she saw blood on [the victim’s] bed. Harkins\n      then left the home.\n             Trisha and [the victim] called the police, and deputy\n      sheriff Kevin Knoche responded to the call. Deputy Knoche\n      also saw blood on [the victim’s] bed. Deputy Knoche found\n      Harkins sleeping at the home of a friend. Harkins was not\n      wearing his underwear, but it was stuck in the fly of his\n      pants. Harkins denied having sex with [the victim] and\n      stated he could not recall anything like that occurring.\n              [The victim] was taken to a hospital for a physical\n      examination.      [The victim] had three tears, which were\n      bleeding, in the area of the perineum. Nancy Downing, a\n      registered nurse, testified she did not usually find tears that\n      were that large or bleeding at the time of the exam. Downing\n      testified [the victim’s] injuries were consistent with forced\n      sexual intercourse.\n             Harkins was charged with third-degree sexual abuse,\n      in violation of Iowa Code section 709.4 (2005). At the trial\n      Harkins testified he remembered everything about the\n      evening in question. He stated he and [the victim] had\n      engaged in consensual sex. He stated that in the middle of\n      having sex, he found out [the victim] had recently had sex\n      with Derrick, and he made a derogatory comment to her. He\n      stated [the victim] got mad and threw him out.\n            A jury found Harkins guilty of third-degree sexual\n      abuse. Harkins was sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n      not to exceed ten years.\n\nState v. Harkins, No. 06–0660, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">914032</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 28,\n\n2007).\n\n      After the court of appeals affirmed Harkins’s conviction, the district\n\ncourt imposed a special life sentence on Harkins pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 903B.1 (Supp. 2005), in addition to the original ten-year term of\n\nimprisonment. Harkins appealed the special sentence, asserting it was\n\nunconstitutional and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object\n\nto it. On July 22, 2009, the court of appeals rejected these arguments\n\f                                       4\n\nand again affirmed the district court. State v. Harkins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n502 (Iowa Ct. App. 2009).\n\n      Having been unsuccessful on his direct appeals, Harkins filed an\n\napplication for postconviction relief. There he alleged four different bases\n\nfor ineffective assistance, including an allegation that his counsel should\n\nhave advised him not to testify at trial. The application was denied by\n\nthe district court, and that denial was affirmed by the court of appeals on\n\nJanuary 22, 2010.      Harkins v. State, No. 08–2048, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">200408</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2010).\n\n      Meanwhile, Harkins was incarcerated in the Mount Pleasant\n\nCorrectional Facility. During 2007 and the first part of 2008, Harkins\n\nremained on the waiting list for the institution’s sex offender treatment\n\nprogram (SOTP).     On or about July 2, 2008, an opening in the SOTP\n\nbecame available. Harkins alleges, and the State does not dispute, that\n\nbefore he could participate in the program, Harkins had to sign a\n\n“Treatment Contract,” in which he “agree[d] to be completely honest and\n\nassume full responsibility for [his] offenses and [his] behavior.” Harkins\n\nrefused to sign the contract and to participate in the SOTP. In response,\n\non July 9, 2008, the Iowa Department of Corrections (IDOC) suspended\n\nHarkins’s earned time pursuant to Iowa Code section 903A.2(1)(a) (2007).\n\n      Section 903A.2(1)(a) states an inmate under the control of IDOC\n\nserving a category “A” sentence 1 is eligible for earned-time credit “equal\n\nto one and two-tenths days for each day the inmate demonstrates good\n\nconduct and satisfactorily participates in any program . . . identified by\n\nthe director [of the department of corrections].”         In addition to this\n\ngeneral statement, the statute also provides that “an inmate required to\n\n      1Harkins is serving a category “A” sentence because he is not subject to a\nmandatory minimum under Iowa Code section 902.12. See Iowa Code § 903A.2(1)(a).\n\f                                    5\n\nparticipate in a sex offender treatment program shall not be eligible for a\n\nreduction of sentence unless the inmate participates in and completes a\n\nsex offender treatment program established by the director.” Iowa Code\n\n§ 903A.2(1)(a).\n\n      Following the suspension of his earned time, Harkins filed the\n\napplication for postconviction relief at issue in this appeal.    Harkins\n\nargued, essentially, that the suspension of his earned-time credits for\n\nfailure to participate in the SOTP violated his Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination. In particular, Harkins alleged:\n      I have maintained innocen[c]e since day one. I had my\n      appeal and am now going through postconviction relief with\n      my case. I cannot enter treatment because this would be an\n      admission of guilt and would perjur[e] myself in changing my\n      story. Also it would hinder any chance at a new trial if I\n      would sign a confession.\n\n      The district court granted Harkins’s application in part and denied\n\nit in part. The district court determined that by conditioning Harkins’s\n\nearned time upon his participation in the SOTP, in which Harkins would\n\nbe required to acknowledge his criminal conduct, the State was\n\nunconstitutionally compelling Harkins to give testimony. However, the\n\ndistrict court found the testimony would be potentially incriminating only\n\nuntil March 21, 2009, i.e., the last day on which the State could\n\nprosecute Harkins for perjury based upon his 2006 trial testimony. See\n\nIowa Code § 802.3 (three-year statute of limitations).    Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court ordered Harkins’s earned time to be reinstated from July 9,\n\n2008 through March 21, 2009, but suspended as of March 22, 2009,\n\nuntil he participated in and completed the SOTP.\n\n      Both Harkins and the State filed petitions for a writ of certiorari.\n\nHarkins argued the district court should not have suspended his accrual\n\nof earned time as of March 22, 2009.      The State, in turn, argued the\n\f                                            6\n\ndistrict court should have upheld its original decision to suspend\n\nHarkins’s earned time as of July 9, 2008, the date when he refused to\n\nenter the treatment program.               We granted the two petitions and\n\nconsolidated the proceedings.\n\n       II. Standard of Review.\n\n       We normally review certiorari actions for correction of errors at\n\nlaw. Iowa R. Civ.

In his view, there was an important distinction\n\nbetween the mandatory, official sanction present in Lile’s case and “a\n\nmere risk of adverse consequences stemming from a voluntary choice” in\n\ncases like Woodard, Murphy, and Baxter.

Nonetheless, she went on to criticize the plurality for\n\nsuggesting that more serious consequences such as “longer incarceration\n\nand execution” could not constitute unconstitutional compulsion. Id.\n\n      Yet Justice O’Connor also criticized the dissent for its inability to\n\ndraw a reasoned distinction between the “criminal justice” cases such as\n\nWoodard, Murphy, and Baxter—which upheld more severe sanctions than\n\nthose imposed on Lile (e.g., loss of life in Woodard)—and the “penalty”\n\ncases such as Cunningham, Turley, Uniformed Sanitation Men, and\n\nSpevack.

Id.\n\n      In Justice O’Connor’s view, the critical issue for Fifth Amendment\n\npurposes was not necessarily the actual penalty or sanction, but the\n\ncontext within which it was imposed. She elaborated:\n              I believe the proper theory [of the Fifth Amendment\n      privilege against self-incrimination] should recognize that it\n      is generally acceptable to impose the risk of punishment,\n      however great, so long as the actual imposition of such\n      punishment is accomplished through a fair criminal process.\n      . . . Forcing defendants to accept such consequences seems\n      to me very different from imposing penalties for the refusal to\n      incriminate oneself that go beyond the criminal process and\n      appear, starkly, as government attempts to compel\n      testimony; in the latter context, any penalty that is capable\n      of compelling a person to be a witness against himself is\n      illegitimate.\n\nId. at 53, 122 S.

McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Justice O’Connor thus appears to allow\n\nfor the possibility that individuals who have been convicted through a\n\n“fair criminal process” can suffer significant adverse consequences,\n\nincluding a potentially longer period of incarceration, for choosing not to\n\nacknowledge their offense, provided the state was not engaged in a direct\n\neffort to compel testimony.

Both opinions, in the\n\nend, do not regard compulsion as a simple “How serious is the\n\nconsequence?” inquiry.     Rather, both of them recognize that a fair\n\ncriminal process may impose difficult choices on defendants to serve a\n\nvalid penological goal, without crossing the line into unconstitutional\n\ncompulsion.\n\n      C. Post-McKune Decisions of Federal Appellate Courts. In the\n\nwake of McKune, a number of federal appellate courts have had to decide\n\nwhether it violates the Fifth Amendment when a sex offender receives\n\nmore prison time, rather than just stricter prison conditions, because he or\n\nshe refused to participate in a treatment program that required him or\n\nher to admit past sex crimes.       For the most part, based on their\n\nunderstanding of the scope of McKune, they have rejected these Fifth\n\nAmendment claims.\n\n      In Searcy v. Simmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162490\"><a href=\"/opinion/162490/searcy-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2002), a case that\n\nhad been held by the appellate court pending McKune, the Tenth Circuit\n\nconcluded a Kansas sex offender’s loss of the ability to earn good-time\n\ncredits because he refused to accept responsibility for his crime and\n\f                                    17\n\ndisclose other possible sex crimes did not violate the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe court acknowledged that this specific situation was not expressly\n\ncovered by McKune. Searcy, 299 F.3d at 1225. Nonetheless, applying\n\nJustice O’Connor’s concurrence as the dispositive opinion, the court\n\nfound that Searcy had been convicted in a “fair criminal process,” and\n\n“[w]hile the potential for incrimination is not disputed, there is no\n\nassertion that the KDOC is using the SATP as a surreptitious means to\n\nobtain evidence for criminal prosecutions.” Id. at 1226–27. As the court\n\nexplained:\n      Mr. Searcy’s lost privileges and lost opportunity to earn\n      future good time credits are quite simply not the result of his\n      refusal to incriminate himself, but are a consequence of his\n      inability to complete rehabilitation the KDOC has\n      determined—in light of the serious offense for which Mr.\n      Searcy was convicted—is in the best interest for Mr. Searcy\n      and society.\n\nId. at 1227.\n\n      Ainsworth v. Stanley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200255\"><a href=\"/opinion/200255/ainsworth-v-commissioner-nh/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2002), decided on\n\nremand after McKune, reached a similar outcome. There the First Circuit\n\nheld New Hampshire could constitutionally deny parole in most\n\ninstances to sex offenders who refused to accept responsibility for their\ncrimes. That court commented that “Justice O’Connor does not purport\n\nto lay out any abstract analysis or unifying theory that would prefigure\n\nher views regarding the constitutionality of New Hampshire’s program,”\n\nand therefore “we have no clear guideposts.” Ainsworth, 317 F.3d at 4.\n\nHence, the First Circuit deferred to its previously expressed view that\n\nunder recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the compulsion\n\nanalysis “is more circumscribed in the prison context” and only\n\n“unreasonable” burdens are proscribed.      Id. at 5.   Reiterating its pre-\n\nMcKune approach, the First Circuit concluded that New Hampshire could\n\f                                      18\n\nsubject sex offenders who refused to participate in treatment that\n\nrequired acceptance of responsibility to the likelihood of a longer period\n\nof incarceration, because the overall burden was not unreasonable in\n\nlight of the relevant circumstances, including “the voluntary nature of\n\nthe program” (i.e., participation is a choice) and the state’s “valid”\n\ninterest in effective rehabilitation. Id. at 5–6.\n\n      Although the First Circuit purported to be following its own earlier\n\nprecedents rather than Justice O’Connor’s concurrence, one can argue\n\nthat its analytical approach is not that different from hers. The “factors”\n\nmentioned in its opinion, i.e., that the defendant was presented with a\n\nchoice within a fair criminal process and that the state’s purpose was not\n\ntestimonial, surface also in Justice O’Connor’s discussion of “proper\n\ntheory” of the Fifth Amendment. McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Relying expressly on Searcy and\n\nJustice O’Connor’s concurrence in McKune, the court found that the loss\n\nof an opportunity for a discretionary sentence-reduction credit “is not\n\namong the consequences for noncompliance that go ‘beyond the criminal\n\nprocess and appear, starkly, as government attempts to compel\n\ntestimony.’ ” Entzi, 485 F.3d at 1004 (quoting McKune, 536 U.S. at 53,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring)). This\n\ncourt found, therefore, no unconstitutional compulsion. Id.\n\n      Likewise, in DeFoy v. McCullough, 301 F. App’x 177 (3rd Cir. 2008),\n\nthe Third Circuit upheld Pennsylvania’s denial of reparole to a sex\n\f                                           19\n\noffender based in part on the offender’s refusal to participate in a\n\ntreatment program.         The treatment program would have required the\n\ninmate to admit his guilt even though he had obtained a new trial on the\n\nunderlying charges.         DeFoy, 301 F.App’x at 178.              Applying Justice\n\nO’Connor’s concurrence, the court reasoned that no unconstitutional\n\ncompulsion had occurred.             DeFoy’s sentence was not extended; he\n\n“merely had to serve the rest of his sentence, imposed through a fair\n\ncriminal process.”       Id.   Furthermore, “DeFoy was not denied reparole\n\nbecause he invoked the Fifth Amendment, but rather, primarily because\n\nhe chose not to participate in treatment.”                 Id. at 182.       Thus, the\n\nconsiderations noted by Justice O’Connor in her concurrence—i.e., the\n\nsanction merely forced the prisoner to serve out a sentence imposed in a\n\nfair criminal process, the prisoner was given a choice, and the purpose of\n\nthe program was truly rehabilitative rather than to obtain testimony, see\n\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 69\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)—were dispositive in overruling the Fifth\n\nAmendment claim. 3 DeFoy, 301 F.App’x at 182.\n\n\n\n\n        3At least one of these federal appellate decisions, i.e., Searcy, involved an\n\nautomatic loss of eligibility for sentence-reduction credits, similar to Iowa Code section\n903A.2(1)(a). Under the program at issue in Searcy, failure to participate in the\ntreatment program meant that the inmate forfeited eligibility for sentence-reduction\ncredits, but (as in Iowa) participation did not guarantee a reduction in sentence.\nSearcy, 299 F.3d at 1223 (noting that an inmate who refuses to participate in a sex\noffender treatment program “loses the opportunity to earn any further good time\ncredits” and “those credits . . . cannot be regained”); see also Ainsworth, 317 F.3d at 3\n(noting that “nonparticipation in the [sex offenders program] almost always results in\nan inmate being denied parole”); DeFoy, 301 F. App’x at 179 (noting that “it was the\nrare case that parole was granted without treatment”). As we point out above, Justice\nO’Connor’s concurrence rejects the notion urged by Justice Stevens in dissent that it\nmakes a constitutional difference whether “the negative outcome” follows directly from\n“the decision to remain silent,” McKune, 536 U.S. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring), or whether the decision simply makes that outcome\nmore likely.\n\f                                     20\n\n      The Ninth Circuit reached a different result in United States v.\n\nAntelope, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789030\"><a href=\"/opinion/789030/united-states-v-lawrence-antelope-united-states-of-america-v-lawrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2005), but the facts there were\n\nsomewhat different. The defendant had pled guilty to possession of child\n\npornography and was required to participate in a treatment program as a\n\ncondition of obtaining supervised release. Antelope, 395 F.3d at 1131.\n\nThe defendant had no Fifth Amendment objection to admitting the crime\n\nof which he had been convicted, but objected to having to disclose other\n\npotential criminal conduct in the course of the program. Id. Although\n\nthe court found a violation of the defendant’s right against self-\n\nincrimination, its overall interpretation of O’Connor’s concurrence does\n\nnot appear to vary from that of the other circuits. To the contrary, the\n\nNinth Circuit found that under her concurrence,\n      the compulsion inquiry does not dispositively turn on the\n      status of the person claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege\n      or on the severity of the penalty imposed, although these\n      factors may bear on the analysis. Instead, the controlling\n      issue is the state’s purpose in imposing the penalty:\n      Although it may be acceptable for the state to impose harsh\n      penalties on defendants when it has legitimate reasons for\n      doing so consistent with their conviction for their crimes of\n      incarceration, it is a different thing to impose “penalties for\n      the refusal to incriminate oneself that go beyond the criminal\n      process and appear, starkly, as government attempts to\n      compel testimony.”\n\nId. at 1137 (quoting McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, 153 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring)). A crucial point for the Ninth\n\nCircuit was that the federal government was sanctioning “Antelope for\n\nhis self-protective silence about conduct that might constitute other\n\ncrimes.”   Id.   These kinds of disclosures, the Ninth Circuit felt, were\n\n“starkly   incriminating”   regardless    of   their   potential   rehabilitative\n\npurpose. Id. at 1138.\n\n      D. Post-McKune Decisions of State Appellate Courts.

Each received an “executed\n\nsentence,” which under Minnesota’s sentencing scheme typically equated\n\nto a term of actual imprisonment of two-thirds that amount. 735 N.W.2d\n\nat 299. The term of actual imprisonment was subject to extension if the\n\ndefendant committed a disciplinary offense while incarcerated. Id. When\n\nthe defendants refused to participate in Minnesota’s sex offender\n\ntreatment    program,    those   refusals   were   considered   disciplinary\n\nviolations, and their terms of actual imprisonment were extended by\n\f                                   22\n\nforty-five days. Id. at 298. The defendants challenged these extensions\n\nas violating their Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n      In assessing the defendants’ Fifth Amendment claims, the Johnson\n\ncourt agreed that McKune was the relevant precedent. But it declined to\n\nfollow the “comments about sanctions that extend the term of\n\nincarceration” in both the plurality opinion and Justice O’Connor’s\n\nopinion on the grounds they were dicta. Id. at 304. Instead, the Johnson\n\ncourt ultimately concluded that under both opinions, “atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship” was the relevant benchmark. Id. at 304–05. That\n\nis, if the sanction amounted to such a hardship, it was “compulsion”; if\n\nnot, it was not. Id. As the Minnesota court put it:\n      [I]t is clear to us that a majority composed of the plurality\n      and Justice O’Connor (and likely the dissenting Justices as\n      well) agreed in McKune that consequences that impose\n      atypical and significant hardship in prison constitute\n      compulsion for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nId. at 306.   The court then went on to hold that forty-five days of\n\nadditional incarceration met the “atypical and significant hardship” test\n\nand therefore constituted unconstitutional compulsion. Id. at 306–09.\n\n      Two dissenting justices in Johnson disagreed with their colleagues’\n\nreading of McKune.     They maintained that neither the plurality nor\n\nJustice O’Connor had endorsed “atypical and significant hardship” as the\n\nstandard for whether compulsion was present. Id. at 313. At most, the\n\npresence of such a hardship was a necessary but not sufficient condition\n\nfor finding compulsion. Id. Discerning “no clear guideposts” in McKune,\n\nthe dissenters argued that Minnesota should continue to follow its pre-\n\nMcKune precedent that extending an inmate’s supervised release date\n\ndue to his failure to participate in a sex offender program was not\n\n“compulsion” in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 312–14 (citing\n\f                                        23\n\nState ex rel. Morrow v.

The\n\ndissent elaborated:\n             Numerous federal circuit courts have considered this\n      issue and held that extension of a supervised release date for\n      failure to participate in treatment is not compulsion. While\n      the majority cites cases that have held differently, I find that\n      the Supreme Court has not spoken clearly on this issue, nor\n      is there a national consensus that would compel us to\n      overturn Morrow. I would hold that extending an inmate’s\n      supervised release date because of his failure to participate\n      in a sex offender treatment program does not rise to the level\n      of compulsion necessary to violate the inmate’s Fifth\n      Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nId. at 315 (citations omitted).\n\n      We    have   some    difficulty    squaring   the   Johnson   majority’s\n\ninterpretation of McKune with our own. While neither Justice Kennedy\n\nnor Justice O’Connor in McKune precisely delineated the permissible\n\nouter limits of “compulsion” in the prison context, neither indicated that\n\nimposing an “atypical and significant hardship” would automatically\n\ncross those limits.   To the contrary, both opinions noted that in prior\n\ncases, like Woodard, states had been allowed to impose far more serious\n\nconsequences, such as a potential loss of clemency, on inmates who\n\nchose to exercise their Fifth Amendment rights.           Thus, both opinions\n\nfound that the question of compulsion had to be analyzed in context,\n\nwith particular emphasis (according to Justice O’Connor) on whether the\n\nconsequence arose as a choice afforded by a fair criminal process and\n\nwhether the underlying purpose was rehabilitative rather than the\n\ncompulsion of testimony.      In our view, the respective decisions of the\n\nTenth, Eighth, and Third Circuits in Searcy, Entzi, and DeFoy more\n\naccurately reflect this approach.\n\n      E. Applying McKune to This Case.              Based on our reading of\n\nMcKune, we find no Fifth Amendment violation here. The requirement\n\f                                     24\n\nthat Harkins participate in the SOTP to be eligible for earned-time credits\n\nwas part of “a fair criminal process.” McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).             Section\n\n903A.2(1)(a), which established this requirement, was the law both when\n\nHarkins was alleged to have sexually assaulted his victim, and when he\n\nwas convicted of doing so. Thus, from the moment Harkins committed\n\nhis crime, it was clear that if he was convicted and chose not to\n\nparticipate in the prescribed treatment program, he would not be eligible\n\nfor earned-time credits.     That was the set of consequences for his\n\nconduct prescribed by the legislature.\n\n      Encouraging a convicted sex offender to participate in a SOTP\n\nwhere he has to acknowledge his crime also serves important\n\nrehabilitative goals. The State of Iowa is not “starkly . . . attempt[ing] to\n\ncompel testimony.” Id. Rather, the undisputed purpose of the program\n\nis to get the offender to confront his or her past behavior so it does not\n\nreoccur. Harkins does not claim that he will be forced to disclose other,\n\nas-yet-unknown sex offenses. Cf. Antelope, 395 F.3d at 1137. In fact,\n\nthe only admission the State could obtain here is one it almost certainly\n\ndoes not need, since Harkins has been convicted and his conviction has\n\nbeen upheld on direct appeal.\n\n      The specifics of this case illustrate what the legislature might have\n\nhad in mind when it enacted section 903A.2(1)(a).            The evidence,\n\nsummarized above, supports a finding that Harkins committed a rather\n\nviolent sexual assault. Harkins’s original story to the police was that he\n\nhad not had sexual relations with the victim. At trial, Harkins changed\n\ncourse and admitted having had sex with the victim, but claimed it was\n\nconsensual.    Now, according to a memo that is part of the record,\n\nHarkins maintains, “I am not guilty and am not going to take the\n\f                                     25\n\nprogram.”       Under these circumstances, a rehabilitation program\n\nrequiring the offender to confront his past offense might be particularly\n\nbeneficial. We do not see the Fifth Amendment as a barrier to an earned-\n\ncredit incentive for Harkins to participate in such a program.\n\n         Both the plurality and the special concurrence in McKune\n\nindicated that compulsion in the prison setting is not a simple question\n\nof, “How big is the stick or carrot?”       Instead, Justice Kennedy and\n\nJustice O’Connor recognized that a convicted criminal defendant may be\n\nconfronted with choices, such as whether to take the stand at a clemency\n\nhearing or whether to participate in sex offender treatment, which might\n\nbe considered compulsion in other circumstances, but are deemed\n\nlegitimate exercises of state authority here.    We therefore need to ask\n\nwhether the choice arose as a result of the defendant’s conviction within\n\nthe criminal justice system and whether imposing the choice serves a\n\nproper goal of that system.     We have and we believe the answers are\n\nclear.\n\n         Thus, while a loss of eligibility for earned-time credits clearly\n\n“implicates a liberty interest,” Reilly v. Iowa Dist. Ct., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1587862\"><a href=\"/opinion/1587862/reilly-v-iowa-dist-court-for-henry-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n496 (Iowa 2010), it does not equate in this case with unconstitutional\n\ncompulsion. The State is not using a threatened loss of credits to try to\n\nextract testimony; instead, it is attempting to administer a bona fide\n\nrehabilitation program for sex offenders who have already been found\n\nguilty under a statutory scheme that afforded them all required due\n\nprocess.\n         We also find support for this conclusion in In re C.H., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1248800\"><a href=\"/opinion/1248800/in-re-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2002), where we addressed a father’s claim that his Fifth\nAmendment rights had been violated when his parental rights were\nterminated after he failed to complete a sex offender treatment program.\n\f                                          26\n\nWe made clear that “sexual offender treatment where the offender refuses\nto take responsibility for the abuse may constitute ineffective therapy,”\nand that the State of Iowa could terminate parental rights based on a\nparent sex offender’s “failure to obtain treatment for his or her\nproblems.” In re C.H., 652 N.W.2d at 150. We specifically noted that “a\nperson’s    exercise     of   a    constitutional     right    may     indeed     have\nconsequences”—without resulting in a Fifth Amendment violation.                     Id.\nJust as in C.H., where we held that a father who failed to complete a\ntreatment program due to his assertion of Fifth Amendment rights could\nsuffer loss of parental rights, so here we hold that a convicted sex\noffender who failed to complete a treatment program due to his assertion\nof Fifth Amendment rights may constitutionally have his eligibility for\nearned-time credits suspended.           If the loss of parental rights does not\namount to unconstitutional compulsion, it is difficult to see how the\nsuspension of earned-time credits would either—so long as in both cases\nthe State is not simply trying to obtain testimony for future use. 4\n       IV. Conclusion.\n       Harkins had every right not to be a witness against himself, a right\nhe actually chose to waive at trial by taking the stand. Now that he has\nbeen convicted as a sex offender, though, the State of Iowa may\nconstitutionally establish an incentive for him to obtain treatment in\nprison by withholding earned-time credits if he declines to participate.\n\n\n\n        4It is true we said in C.H., “The State may require parents to otherwise undergo\n\ntreatment, but it may not specifically require an admission of guilt as part of the\ntreatment.” 652 N.W.2d at 150. Thus, a distinction exists between the present case,\nwhere the SOTP expressly requires acceptance of responsibility, and C.H., where the\nState simply required treatment and admission of responsibility was part of the\ntreatment. Yet the more significant distinction cuts the other way. In this case,\nHarkins has already been convicted of a sex offense in a criminal proceeding; in C.H.,\nthe father had not been. Hence, there were more grounds for concern in C.H. about\n“stark[] government attempts to compel testimony.” McKune, 536 U.S. at 53, 122 S.

Iowa Dist. Ct./Harkins v. Iowa Dist. Ct.\n\nAPPEL, Justice (dissenting).\n\n        I respectfully dissent. I would hold that Harkins is entitled to use\n\nand derivative-use immunity under the Federal Constitution with respect\n\nto incriminating statements that he may be required to make pursuant\n\nto his participation in the sex offender treatment program (SOTP) in this\n\ncase.\n\n        I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n        The facts are simple and undisputed. Harkins has been convicted\n\nof a sex crime. The State of Iowa has determined that he should receive\n\ntreatment in prison for sex offenders.      The SOTP requires Harkins to\n\naccept full responsibility for his offenses and behavior. The program also\n\nrequires that Harkins agree to undergo a polygraph examination.            If\n\nHarkins declines to participate in the SOTP, he will not receive earned-\n\ntime credit.     Simply put, if he chooses to remain silent by not\n\nparticipating in the program, he will likely be incarcerated for a\n\nsubstantially longer period of time.\n\n        Harkins cries foul.   He filed without the assistance of counsel a\n\npetition in district court challenging the process as violating his privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination. Harkins claims if he participates in the SOTP\n\nand makes the required disclosures, he could be criminally prosecuted\n\nfor perjury because of his testimony in the underlying criminal trial.\n\nHarkins further asserts that the admissions required in the SOTP could\n\nbe used against him in a subsequent trial on the underlying offense if he\n\nis granted a new trial on postconviction relief.     He claims that he is\n\nentitled to use immunity.       In the district court, he did not identify\n\nwhether he was proceeding under the Federal or State Constitution.\n\f                                     29\n\n      The district court granted Harkins’s application in part and denied\n\nit in part. Harkins filed a writ of certiorari. In his pro se briefing, he\n\ndeclared that he was proceeding based on “the Fifth Amendment right\n\nagainst self-incrimination . . . and [the] right to due process.”\n\n      II. Analysis Under Federal Constitution.\n\n      A. Background to Fifth Amendment.              The Fifth Amendment\n\nprovides that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to\n\nbe a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. A brief review of\n\nthe historical background of the Fifth Amendment provides the context of\n\nmy consideration of this case.\n\n      After the Norman Conquest, ecclesiastical courts were established\n\nto settle disputes. Leonard W. Levy, Origins of the Fifth Amendment: The\n\nRight Against Self-Incrimination 43 (Macmillan Publ’g Co., 2d ed. 1986)\n\n[hereinafter Levy]. These courts were inquisitorial in nature.

Padfield, Self-Incrimination and Acceptance of\n\nResponsibility in Prison Sex Offender Treatment Programs, 49 U. Kan. L.\n\nRev. 487, 491 (2001). The most infamous of these courts was the “Star\n\nChamber.” See Mark A. Godsey, Rethinking the Involuntary Confession\n\nRule: Toward A Workable Test for Identifying Compelled Self-Incrimination,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 465, 481 (2005).\n\n      Star Chamber proceedings were classic fishing expeditions in\n\nwhich interrogators could roam far and wide in an attempt to establish\n\nmisconduct of persons under examination.          See Akhil Reed Amar &\n\nRenee B. Lettow, Fifth Amendment Principles:          The Self-Incrimination\n\nClause, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Rev. 807, 846 (2008).     A person appearing before the Star\n\nChamber had no notice of charges and was forced, under oath, to answer\n\nany and all questions. Levy at 50–51; 8 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence\n\nin Trials at Common Law § 2250, at 278 & n.43 (McNaughton rev. ed.\n\n1961). The Star Chamber presented the target with a classic Hobson’s\n\nchoice: answer questions and incriminate yourself or do not answer\n\nquestions and be punished for your silence.\n\n      Common     law   courts   eventually   supplanted   the   ecclesiastic\n\nauthorities and rejected, in large part, the inquisitorial approach. David\n\nHeim, Note, Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don’t—Why Minnesota’s\n\nPrison-Based Sex Offender Treatment Program Violates the Right Against\n\nSelf-Incrimination, 32 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 1217, 1226 (2006).             At\n\ncommon law, in addition to a right to be free from compelled testimony,\n\nan affirmative right to remain silent developed—a right that was\n\nrecognized both in court proceedings and in interrogations by agents of\n\nthe state. Id. These restrictions, however, were mere rules of evidence.\n\n      State constitutions enacted after the American Revolution, but\n\nprior to the constitutional convention, embraced the right against self-\n\nincrimination as a constitutional norm.        For example, the Virginia\n\nDeclaration of Rights provided “in all capital or criminal prosecutions a\n\nman . . . cannot . . . be compelled to give evidence against himself.” Levy\n\nat 405–06. The framers relied on these state constitutional precedents in\n\nfashioning the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id. at\n\n409. While it is commonly believed that state constitutional provisions\n\nwere modeled after the Federal Constitution, the opposite is generally\n\ntrue with respect to the Fifth Amendment. See id.\n\f                                     31\n\n      The purposes of the Fifth Amendment have been discussed in\n\nnumerous cases in both state and federal courts.

Framework for Resolution of Fifth Amendment Issues.\n\nWhile murky on the edges, the United States Supreme Court has\n\nestablished a general framework for analysis of Fifth Amendment issues.\n\nIt is well established that the Fifth Amendment applies in any\n\nproceeding, criminal or civil, in which officials seek answers that might\n\nincriminate the party providing the responses in future criminal\n\nproceedings.

There is thus no dispute that requiring\n\nstatements from a prisoner as part of a sex offender treatment program\n\nis within the scope of proceedings where the protections of the Fifth\n\nAmendment apply.\n\n      In addition, while the Fifth Amendment privilege is not always self-\n\nexecuting, United States v.

He has refused to participate in the SOTP\n\nexplicitly on self-incrimination grounds.\n\n      Finally, while the Fifth Amendment applies only where the\n\nstatements sought by the state might incriminate the person asserting\n\nthe privilege in future criminal proceedings, Lefkowitz, 414 U.S. at 77, 94\n\nS. Ct. at 322, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 281, there is no question in this case that\n\nHarkins meets this threshold requirement. The Iowa SOTP requires that\n\nHarkins accept responsibility for his offenses and behavior without any\n\nassurances of confidentiality or immunity from prosecution if he provides\n\nthe information required.\n\n      The remaining question of Harkins’s Fifth Amendment claim is\n\nwhether the SOTP compels Harkins to make incriminating statements.

Griffin, 380 U.S. at 609–10, 85\n\nS. Ct. at 1230, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 107. In closing, the prosecutor argued\n\nthat the jury could draw an adverse inference from this failure. Id. at\n\n610–11, 85 S. Ct. at 1231, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 107–08. The trial court also\n\ninstructed the jury that, while the defendant had a constitutional right\n\nnot to testify, the jury could draw an adverse inference from his failure.\n\nId. at 610, 85 S. Ct. at 1230, 14 L. Ed. 2d at 107. The Supreme Court\n\nheld that the comment of the prosecutor and the trial court instruction\n\nimpermissibly imposed a penalty on the exercise of the constitutional\n\f                                       35\n\nright to remain silent. Id. at 614–15, 85 S. Ct. at 1232–33, 14 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 109–10.

The Spevack Court noted that a penalty “is not restricted to a\n\nfine or imprisonment” and includes “the imposition of any sanction\n\nwhich makes assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege ‘costly.’ ”\n\nSpevack, 385 U.S. at 515, 87 S.

The\n\nCourt continued, warning:\n\n           “It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest\n      and   least    repulsive    form;    but     illegitimate  and\n      unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way,\n      namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal\n\f                                   36\n      modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering\n      to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of\n      person and property should be liberally construed.

Lefkowitz, 414 U.S. at 71–73, 94 S. Ct. at\n\n320–21, 38 L. Ed. 2d at 278–80.

Id. at 440, 104 S. Ct. at 1149,\n\n79 L. Ed. 2d at 428. The Supreme Court majority repeatedly framed the\n\nissue as one of “waiver” and “timely” assertion of Fifth Amendment\n\nrights.

While a timely\n\nassertion of Fifth Amendment privileges was not required in penalty\n\ncases, the Murphy Court noted that the state did not impose a penalty\n\nbecause the probationer was only required to appear before his probation\n\nofficer and discuss matters concerning probation. Id. at 435, 104 S. Ct.\n\nat 1146, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 424. The state did not require the probationer\n\nto surrender his Fifth Amendment privilege or face a penalty. Id. at 436–\n\n37, 104 S. Ct. at 1147, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 425–26.                   Once the probation\n\nofficer exercised his discretion to ask questions requiring the probationer\n\nto provide potentially incriminating answers, the probationer was\n\nrequired to assert the privilege. Id. at 437–38, 104 S. Ct. at 1147–48, 79\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 426–27. At that point, the state would have the option of\n\ndropping the inquiry or providing immunity sufficient to address the\n\nprivilege. 5 Id. at 435 n.7, 104 S. Ct. at 1146 n.7, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 425\n\nn.7.\n\n       The Murphy Court emphasized, however, that the probationer did\n\nnot lose his Fifth Amendment protection simply because he had been\n\n\n       5Justice   Marshall, joined by Justice Stevens in part and by Justice Brennan,\ndissented. The dissent recognized that the key issue in the case was whether the\nprobationer was required to timely assert the privilege or whether the privilege was self-\nexecuting. Murphy, 465 U.S. at 442, 104 S. Ct. at 1150, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 429 (Marshall,\nJ., dissenting) (asserting that the flaw in the majority’s approach lies not in analysis of\nconstitutional rights, but in finding that rights were not violated in this case because of\nMurphy’s failure to assert privilege).\n\f                                    39\n\nconvicted of a prior crime. Id. at 426, 104 S. Ct. at 1141, 79 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n418. Further, the Murphy Court implied that the outcome would have\n\nbeen different if the probationer had timely invoked his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivileges. See id. at 435, 104 S. Ct. at 1146, 79 L. Ed. 2d at 424–25. As\n\nnoted by the Murphy Court:\n      There is . . . a substantial basis in our cases for concluding\n      that if the State, either expressly or by implication, asserts\n      that invocation of the privilege would lead to revocation of\n      probation, it would have created the classic penalty\n      situation, the failure to assert the privilege would be\n      excused, and the probationer’s answers would be deemed\n      compelled and inadmissible in a criminal prosecution.\n\nId. Plainly, Murphy turned on the fact that the probationer waived his\n\nFifth Amendment rights by responding to the probation officer’s\n\nquestions. See id. at 429, 104 S. Ct. at 1143, 79 L.

Mace, 765 F. Supp. at 851. Thus, in\n\nMace, the court concluded that the privilege was self-executing and\n\nplaced the petitioner in a “classic penalty” situation. Id. The Mace court\n\nrecognized the legitimate state interest in rehabilitation, but observed\n\nthat citizens cannot be forced to incriminate themselves merely because\n\nit advances a governmental need.

While the majority noted that an offender who declined to\n\nparticipate was denied early release from prison, it drew a distinction\n\nbetween early release from one’s sentence, which was not a penalty\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment, and revocation of probation, which was\n\nsuch a penalty.    Morrow, 590 N.W.2d at 793.       The Morrow majority\n\nopinion, however, drew a sharp dissent which found the distinction\n\nunpersuasive and noted the fact that the State of Minnesota had a\n\nlegitimate interest in rehabilitating sex offenders had nothing to do with\n\nthe question of whether the admissions in Minnesota’s sex therapy\n\nprogram were compelled. Id. at 797–98 (Page, J., dissenting).\n\n      At least one pre-McKune court, however, focused on whether denial\n\nof parole or probation automatically followed the exercise of Fifth\n\nAmendment rights in sex therapy programs.

McKune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516893\"><a href=\"/opinion/2516893/lile-v-mckune/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1155 (D. Kan. 1998), the federal district court considered whether\n\na   Kansas   prison-based   sex   therapy   program    violated   the   Fifth\n\nAmendment rights of a prisoner, Robert Lile, who had been convicted of\n\nsex offenses.   At the time of his challenge, Lile had a pending habeas\n\ncorpus petition attacking his state court conviction.         McKune, 24\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 1154. Although he was not required to participate in a\n\nsex offender therapy program at the beginning of his incarceration, Lile’s\n\nprison counselor added the program to Lile’s inmate program agreement.\n\nId. at 1154–55.   After an unsuccessful administrative challenge to the\n\naddition of the program, Lile signed the modified program, but refused to\n\nparticipate in sex offender treatment in part because it required him to\n\nsign an “Admission of Guilt” form. Id. at 1155. He also objected to a\n\nprogram requirement that he provide a written sexual history of all his\n\nprior sexual activities, including uncharged criminal offenses. Id.\n\n      The consequence of failure to participate in the program included\n\ntransfer to a maximum security setting.      Id.   In a maximum security\n\nsetting, Lile would not have access to a personal television.         Id.   In\n\naddition, Lile would be placed in a more dangerous environment and\n\nwould not be able to earn more than $0.60 a day for prison pay.             Id.\n\f                                     43\n\nRestrictions would also be placed on visitation.         Id.   Further, the\n\nmaximum security setting limited the programming available to Lile as\n\nwell as the amount of personal property Lile could keep in his cell. Id.\n\n      The district court found that Lile’s Fifth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated. Id. at 1158. The district court found that, under the Kansas\n\nscheme, unlike that presented in Woodard, automatic sanctions were\n\nimposed for the assertion of Fifth Amendment rights. Id. Although the\n\nautomatic sanctions did not arise to a protected “liberty” interest, there\n\nwas no requirement that a liberty interest be implicated in order to\n\nestablish compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 1159.\n\n      On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\n\naffirmed. Lile v. McKune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160150\"><a href=\"/opinion/160150/lile-v-mckune/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1189 (10th Cir. 2000). At the\n\noutset, the court noted that a refusal to participate in the program did\n\nnot automatically disqualify an inmate from parole and did not lead to a\n\nloss of good-time credits. Id. at 1182. The only automatic sanction was\n\nthe transfer from medium security to a maximum security setting and\n\nthe resulting adverse consequences flowing from the transfer. Id.\n\n      Like the district court, however, the Tenth Circuit rejected the\n\nargument that a “liberty” interest must be implicated in order to\n\nestablish compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.          Id. at 1184.    The\n\nTenth Circuit agreed with the district court that “ ‘by grafting a protected\n\nliberty interest to a finding of compulsion, the standard is set too high.’ ”\n\nId. at 1184 (quoting McKune, 24 F. Supp. 2d at 1159). The Tenth Circuit\n\nnoted that the Supreme Court had held that threat of disbarment,\n\ndamage to professional reputation, and loss of income amounted to\n\nimpermissible compulsion without an explicit characterization of the\n\ndeprivations as protected liberty interests. Id.\n\f                                        44\n\n        The Tenth Circuit distinguished the case from penalty cases where\n\nthe Supreme Court had not found a Fifth Amendment violation. Id. at\n\n1186.     The Tenth Circuit thus found the case distinguishable from\n\nBaxter, in which silence was simply a factor that might be considered in\n\na prison disciplinary hearing, but did not involve any automatic adverse\n\nconsequences. Id. The court also distinguished Woodard by noting that,\n\nwhile the inmate who refuses to participate in a clemency proceeding\n\nmay affect his chances of receiving clemency, Woodard involved no\n\n“separate and distinct substantial or potent consequences” that were\n\nautomatically imposed by his refusal to participate. Id. at 1187. Finally,\n\nthe court noted that, in Murphy, the plaintiff was not actually required to\n\nmake incriminating statements. Id.\n\n        Although the Tenth Circuit determined that the Kansas policy\n\nimposed penalties that violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, the court nonetheless proceeded to balance Lile’s Fifth\n\nAmendment       right   against   the    prison’s   penological   interests   in\n\nmaintaining the program under the four-factor test established in Turner\n\nv. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89–90, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While the court determined that the Kansas\n\nprogram was rationally connected to legitimate governmental interests in\n\nrehabilitation and public safety, it found that Lile had no alternative\n\nmeans of exercising his Fifth Amendment right. Id. at 1191. The court\n\nalso concluded that accommodation of the Fifth Amendment right would\n\nnot have a negative effect on guards, other prisoners, or prison\n\nresources. Id. Further, and most importantly, the court reasoned that\n\nthe grant of use immunity or some form of privilege was an “obvious,\n\neasy alternative” to save the program from constitutional infirmity.

According to Justice O’Connor, the\n\nimposition of such outcomes for refusing to incriminate oneself would\n\nsurely implicate a “liberty” interest. Id. The logical implication of Justice\n\nO’Connor’s concurrence is that, while a “liberty” interest is not a\n\nprerequisite for stating a Fifth Amendment compulsion claim, the\n\nsacrifice of a protected “liberty” interest would, at minimum, raise\n\nserious difficulties under the Fifth Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme\n\nCourt has not embraced the balancing approach in Justice Kennedy’s\n\nplurality opinion.\n\n      F. Federal Case Law Subsequent to McKune.           Subsequent to\n\nMcKune, federal courts have considered Fifth Amendment claims by\n\nprisoners in a number of contexts.      Shortly after McKune, the Tenth\n\nCircuit decided Searcy v. Simmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162490\"><a href=\"/opinion/162490/searcy-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2002). In\n\nSearcy, the facts differed from McKune in that the prisoner claimed that\n\nhis good-time credits were impacted when he refused to incriminate\n\nhimself in a sex offender therapy program. Searcy, 299 F.3d at 1223.\n\nThe Searcy court concluded that, because the prisoner did not lose\n\nguaranteed good-time credits due to his refusal to participate in the sex\n\noffender therapy program, there was no constitutional violation. Id. at\n\n1226; see also Wirsching v. Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164372\"><a href=\"/opinion/164372/wirsching-v-state-of-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1203–04 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (no Fifth Amendment violation where loss of good-time credits is\n\ndiscretionary).\n\n      Similarly, in Entzi v. Redmann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797696\"><a href=\"/opinion/797696/bruce-entzi-v-don-redmann-ken-sorenson-kevin-arthaud-leann-k-bertsch/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1000 (8th Cir. 2007),\n\nthe Eighth Circuit considered a Fifth Amendment claim by a prisoner\n\nwhose supervised probation was conditioned on participation in a sex\n\noffender program. While in prison, Entzi refused to comply with a state\n\ncourt order that he participate in a sex offender education class as a\n\ncondition of probation.   Entzi, 485 F.3d at 1000.     The state filed a\n\npetition to revoke Entzi’s probation based upon his failure to complete\n\nthe program, but the state court dismissed the petition because it\n\nconcluded that the program violated the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 1002.\n\nEntzi brought a § 1983 action claiming that the state violated the Fifth\n\nAmendment by filing the revocation petition and withholding his good-\n\ntime credits for failing to participate in sex offender treatment.   Id. at\n\f                                        50\n\n1001. The district court granted summary judgment and judgment on\n\nthe pleadings against Entzi, and Entzi appealed. Id. at 1001, 1003.\n\n        The Eighth Circuit denied relief.      Id. at 1004.    On the issue of\n\nprobation, the court noted that the only consequence of the refusal to\n\nparticipate in the sex offender treatment program was the filing of a\n\nprobation revocation petition, which the district court refused to grant.\n\nId. at 1002. The mere filing of a petition, according to the Eighth Circuit,\n\nwas not sufficient compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.              Id.   With\n\nrespect to the good-time credit issue, the Eighth Circuit noted that, as in\n\nSearcy, there was no automatic revocation of good-time credits. Id. at\n\n1004.     Instead, the North Dakota Department of Corrections had\n\ndiscretionary authority to order, or not to order, such reductions. Id.\n\n        The Ninth Circuit faced a situation different than that in Searcy\n\nand Entzi in United States v. Antelope, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789030\"><a href=\"/opinion/789030/united-states-v-lawrence-antelope-united-states-of-america-v-lawrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2005).\n\nAntelope was a convicted sex offender who was made an offer of\n\nsupervised release from prison. Antelope, 395 F.3d at 1130. The offer\n\nwas conditioned, however, upon participation in a sex offender therapy\n\nprogram where he was required to submit to polygraph examinations\n\ndetailing his sexual history.     Id.     Antelope refused to submit to the\n\npolygraphs on Fifth Amendment grounds because of the risk that he\n\nmight reveal past crimes that could lead to his prosecution. Id. at 1130.\n\nIn response, the state twice revoked his conditional liberty and sent him\n\nback to prison. Id. at 1131. In Antelope, the Ninth Circuit reviewed the\n\nestablished Fifth Amendment case law and proceeded to analyze two\n\nprongs     required   to   successfully      invoke   the   Fifth   Amendment:\n\nincrimination and compulsion. Id. at 1134.\n\n        With respect to incrimination, the Ninth Circuit found that the risk\n\nwas “real and appreciable.” Id. at 1135. Antelope was required to detail\n\f                                    51\n\nhis sexual history to a probation officer and submit to “full disclosure”\n\npolygraph examinations verifying his sexual history.         Id.     The sex\n\noffender therapy counselor testified that if Antelope revealed past sex\n\noffenses, he would turn over the evidence to prosecutorial authorities.\n\nId.   The counselor further testified that in the past his reports had\n\nresulted in convictions. Id. The disclosure form Antelope was required\n\nto sign specifically authorized the counselor to make such reports. Id.\n\n      The Ninth Circuit next turned to the compulsion prong. The court\n\nnoted while Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion in McKune rejected\n\nreliance on “the so-called penalty cases,” Justice O’Connor’s concurring\n\nopinion found only that the penalties involved in McKune were not severe\n\nenough. Id. at 1136. The court further observed that Justice O’Connor\n\nrejected the notion that “ ‘penalties [like] longer incarceration’ ” were\n\ninsufficient to trigger Fifth Amendment protection. Id. at 1137 (quoting\n\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2034, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 69\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n      Following Justice O’Connor’s opinion, the Ninth Circuit held that\n\nthe state could not sanction Antelope for his silence about other crimes.\n\nId.   Although the court recognized that the state had a legitimate\n\npurpose, the court stated that “[t]he irreconcilable constitutional problem\n\n. . . is that even though the disclosures sought here may serve a valid\n\nrehabilitative purpose, they also may be starkly incriminating.”       Id. at\n\n1138. As a result, the Ninth Circuit found that Antelope was entitled to\n\nKastigar immunity. Id. at 1140–41.\n\n      G. Discussion of Fifth Amendment Issue.\n\n      1.   Controlling authority in context of plurality opinions.    Justice\n\nKennedy’s plurality opinion in McKune—which imports the Sandin\n\nframework in determining whether a sex offender treatment program\n\f                                       52\n\nexacts an unconstitutional penalty under the Fifth Amendment—\n\nrepresented a striking departure from Fifth Amendment case law. The\n\napproach of Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion, however, is not\n\ncontrolling in this case. When there is no majority opinion, the holding\n\nof the Supreme Court is expressed by those members of the Court who\n\nconcurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds. Marks v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Application of approach of Supreme Court precedent. The test\n\nestablished by Justice O’Connor’s concurring opinion is less demanding\n\nthan that of Justice Kennedy’s plurality.        The test to be applied by\n\nJustice O’Connor is somewhat opaque, but it is clearly a lower hurdle\n\nthan the “atypical and significant hardship” standard applied in Sandin.\n\nSee McKune, 536 U.S. at 48, 122 S. Ct. at 2032, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

In this case, by exercising his Fifth\n\nAmendment right, Harkins is automatically deprived of earned time to\n\nwhich he would be otherwise entitled.         See Iowa Code § 903A.2(1)(a)\n\n(2007).    We have held that a prisoner’s interest in earned time under\n\nsuch a scheme is a liberty interest under Sandin that is afforded due\n\nprocess protection. Reilly v. Iowa Dist. Ct., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1587862\"><a href=\"/opinion/1587862/reilly-v-iowa-dist-court-for-henry-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (Iowa\n\f                                          53\n\n2010). The language in Justice O’Connor’s opinion strongly implies that\n\nthe presence of a “liberty” interest would be problematic under the Fifth\n\nAmendment. See McKune, 536 U.S. at 52, 122 S. Ct. at 2034–35, 153 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 69 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n       Justice O’Connor does state that the proper theory should\n\nrecognize that it is “generally acceptable” to impose risk of punishment\n\n“so long as actual imposition of such punishment is accomplished\n\nthrough a fair criminal process.”          Id. at 53, 122 S. Ct. at 2035, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 69.       But a defendant does not receive “a fair criminal\n\nprocess” in a prosecution in which the defendant’s compelled testimony\n\nis used against him. 6\n\n       My approach is consistent with the evolving federal case law. The\n\nlower federal courts, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, distinguish\n\nbetween loss of earned time at the discretion of prison authorities and\n\nloss of earned time that automatically results from an exercise of Fifth\n\nAmendment rights, both before and after McKune. 7 Compare Antelope,\n\n395 F.3d at 1137–38 (finding compulsion where offer of released\n\nsupervision from prison was conditioned upon revealing past crimes),\n\nand Mace, 765 F. Supp. at 850–51 (finding compulsion where probation\nconditioned on self-incrimination), with Ainsworth, 244 F.3d at 220\n\n(finding no compulsion where parole not automatically denied for failure\n\nto complete course), and Searcy, 299 F.3d at 1226 (finding no\n\n       6If, however, this phraseology in Justice O’Connor’s opinion should be\ninterpreted as broadly as suggested by the majority, then Justice Kennedy’s opinion\nbecomes the narrowest ground. The presence of a “liberty interest” would be sufficient\nunder Justice Kennedy’s opinion to extend Fifth Amendment protection to Harkins. See\nMcKune, 536 U.S. at 41, 122 S. Ct. at 2029, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

In In re C.H., there was no automatic termination of parental rights as a\nresult of the failure of the parent to complete a sex therapy program. In re C.H., 652\nN.W.2d at 150. In re C.H. is thus more akin to Woodard than this case.\n\f                                          54\n\ncompulsion where eligibility for good-time credits vested within the\n\ndiscretion of penal authorities).\n\n       In light of Justice O’Connor’s approach and the developing law in\n\nthe federal appellate courts, I conclude that, under the Fifth Amendment,\n\nthe State of Iowa must provide Harkins with immunity that is\n\ncoextensive with the scope of his Fifth Amendment privilege if it seeks to\n\nsubject Harkins to the loss of earned time if he declines to participate in\n\nthe SOTP.       Under Kastigar, it is clear that use and derivative-use\n\nimmunity       satisfies   this   requirement     for   purposes      of   the   Fifth\n\nAmendment. Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 458, 92 S. Ct. at 1664, 32 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 225.\n\n       In light of this analysis, I conclude that Harkins has established\n\nthat the State imposes an impermissible penalty for the exercise of his\n\nFifth Amendment rights. The State may force Harkins to choose between\n\nwaving his Fifth Amendment rights and losing earned-time credit only if\n\nit provides Harkins with use and derivative-use immunity from\n\nprosecution.\n\n       III. Preservation of State Constitutional Issue.\n\n       Independent state constitutional grounds for the right against self-\n\nincrimination are well established. 8 In a footnote, the majority indicates\n\nthat Harkins has not preserved his state constitutional law claim.\n\n       8See,  e.g., State v.

His primitive filings with the district court\n\nmention self-incrimination, but do not identify whether he poses a state\n\nor federal claim.        Ordinarily, when a party generically refers to a\n\nconstitutional claim with both state and federal counterparts but does\n\nnot identify specifically which constitution he or she is proceeding under,\n\nwe will consider the arguments raised under both constitutions.

The majority suggests that Harkins waived his claim\n\nwhen the district court entered a ruling based solely on the Fifth\n\nAmendment and he failed to file a motion under Iowa Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 1.904(2). In Meier v. Senecaut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1803920\"><a href=\"/opinion/1803920/meier-v-senecaut-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2002),\n\nwe noted that a motion for enlargement was necessary to preserve error\n\n“ ‘when the district court fails to resolve an issue, claim, or . . . legal\n\ntheory properly submitted for adjudication.’ ” Meier, 641 N.W.2d at 539\n\n(quoting Explore Info. Servs. v. Iowa Ct. Info. Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2023260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2023260/explore-info-servs-v-court-info-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57\n\n(Iowa 2001)).     Under our cases, it is clear that the district court may\n\nconsider state constitutional claims when a party simply identifies a\n\nconstitutional principle that could have been brought under both\n\nconstitutions. King, 797 N.W.2d at 571. When the district court does\n\nnot consider the state constitutional issue, there is a question as to\n\nwhether the claim is preserved under Meier in the absence of a motion\n\n________________________________\n(holding postarrest silence may not be used against accused under Wyoming\nConstitution). See generally Mary A. Crossley, Note, Miranda and the State Constitution:\nState Courts Take a Stand, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 1693, 1717–30 (1986) (discussing various\nways state courts have departed from federal precedent in interpreting state self-\nincrimination provisions); 2 Jennifer Friesen, State Constitutional Law: Litigating\nIndividual Rights, Claims and Defenses § 12.09, at 12–112 to –115 (LexisNexis, 4th ed.\n2006) (collecting cases).\n\f                                     56\n\nfor enlargement of the district court’s conclusions.         Where a party\n\nclaiming constitutional rights does not distinguish between the Iowa\n\nConstitution and the Federal Constitution, the argument actually made\n\nis applied under both constitutions. Id. As a result, no party has been\n\ndeprived of the opportunity to address a new substantive argument if\n\nMeier error-preservation rules do not apply.\n\n      In this case, however, not only was there a failure to file a motion\n\nfor enlargement after the district court entered a ruling solely on the\n\nfederal constitutional issue, there was a failure at the appellate level as\n\nwell. The State argued that the issue of state constitutional law was not\n\npreserved.    In response, Harkins cited Fifth Amendment cases and\n\ngenerally claimed that his “Fifth Amendment rights and the right to due\n\nprocess” were violated. When faced with an explicit challenge regarding\n\nwhether he adequately raised a state constitutional claim with his vague\n\ndistrict court pleadings, Harkins had an obligation at that point to fish or\n\ncut bait. If he had raised the state constitutional issue in his brief, the\n\nState would then have had an opportunity to reply to his state law\n\nargument. Harkins did not do so, and the majority’s conclusion that we\n\nshould not consider the state law claim in this unusual posture is\n\nprobably correct.\n\n      I am, however, not entirely satisfied with this approach. A pro se\n\nplaintiff is not well schooled in legal niceties. This is not a case involving\n\na prolix pleading where the nature of the claim is impossible to\n\nunderstand.    We know exactly what the factual basis is for the claim.\n\nYet, we have consistently held that where a party raises only a federal or\n\nstate constitutional claim and does not mention or raise in an identifiable\n\nway the parallel constitutional provision, the claim under the parallel\n\nconstitutional provision is not preserved.
