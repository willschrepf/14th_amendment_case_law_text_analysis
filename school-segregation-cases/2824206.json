Lide, LIDE, MONTGOMERY & POTTS,\nP.C., Columbia, South Carolina, for Appellees.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nWILKINSON, Chief Judge:\n\nAfter a series of violent prison incidents involving members of the\nFive Percent Nation of Islam (the Five Percenters), the South Carolina\nDepartment of Corrections (SCDC) classified the Five Percenters as\na Security Threat Group (STG). Acting under its Security Threat\nGroup policy, the SCDC then transferred all Five Percenters to\nadministrative segregation or to maximum custody confinement. A\nnumber of those inmates filed suit, raising challenges to this policy\nunder the Free Exercise Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the\nEighth Amendment of the Constitution. The district court granted\nsummary judgment to the defendant officials of the SCDC, and the\ninmates appeal. Because the designation of the Five Percenters as an\nSTG was a rational response to a threat to prison safety -- a concern\npeculiarly within the province of penal authorities-- we affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\nI.\n\nThis case concerns the long-term segregation under the SCDC's\nSecurity Threat Group policy of inmates affiliated with the Five Per-\ncenters, a group which appellants describe as a religious sect and\nwhich appellees claim is a violent gang. In fact, it was the history of\nviolence involving Five Percenters that led to the group's classifica-\ntion as a security threat. In early 1995 three such incidents occurred\n\n                    3\n\fin SCDC facilities. That January a group of Five Percenters assaulted\nthree other inmates at Lieber Correctional Institution, requiring the\nintervention of corrections personnel. In a second incident that same\nmonth, a group of Five Percenters attacked three correctional officers\nat the Allendale Correctional Institution, beating those officers with\ntheir own batons and assaulting them with their own pepper spray. As\na result, each of the victims was hospitalized. The incident report for\nthe Allendale attack reported that \"these five inmates acted as a\ngroup,\" that they \"felt as if they were acting in a manner acceptable\nto the[ir] religious beliefs,\" and that they \"spoke of more violence to\ncome.\"\n\nThe third, most serious incident occurred in April 1995, when six\nFive Percenters and one other inmate staged a riot in the Broad River\nCorrectional Institution. Wielding knives, softball bats, and a variety\nof improvised weapons, the inmates attacked and severely injured\nseveral correctional officers in the prison cafeteria and yard. The\ninmates then seized one officer and two food service employees as\nhostages, leading to an eleven-hour standoff with law enforcement\npersonnel. Four officers were hospitalized as a result of these events.\n\nThe SCDC's problems with the Five Percenters were neither new\nnor unique. In 1992 an inmate in the Central Correctional Institution\nreported being stabbed and beaten by a group of Five Percenters. Fur-\nthermore, according to the unit manager of the Lee Correctional Insti-\ntution, a group of Five Percenters had been active in that facility as\nearly as 1993, stealing from and preying on weaker inmates and on\none occasion attempting to start a riot. In addition, SCDC Director\nMichael Moore learned that the Five Percenters had been active in\nprison systems in New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Vir-\nginia.\n\nOn June 16, 1995, SCDC Director of Security Kenneth McKellar\nsent Moore a memorandum referring generally to the Five Percenters'\nhistory of violence and describing specifically the Broad River hos-\ntage taking. In addition, the memorandum informed Moore that both\nthe New Jersey Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons had classified the Five Percenters as a threat group. McKellar\nattached to this memo a New Jersey intelligence report describing the\nFive Percenters as \"a group of individuals who espouse violence as\n\n                    4\n\fa means to an end.\" A federal intelligence summary, also obtained by\nthe SCDC, called the Five Percenters a \"radical Islamic sect/criminal\ngroup\" that \"is often boldly racist in its views, prolific in its criminal\nactivities, and operates behind a facade of cultural and religious rheto-\nric.\" Based on this information and the SCDC's own experience,\nMcKellar recommended and Moore approved the designation of the\nFive Percenters as an STG in South Carolina.\n\nThe SCDC's Security Threat Group policy defines an STG as\n\n          any formal or informal organization, association, or group of\n          three (3) or more inmates that have a common name, and\n          whose members or associates engage or have engaged in\n          two (2) or more activities that include planning, organizing,\n          threatening, financing, soliciting or committing unlawful\n          acts or acts of misconduct classified as serious threats or\n          potential threats to the safety and security of the public, the\n          Department, employees, visitors and/or other inmates.\n\nSCDC Policy No. OP-21.01.1 The SCDC Director may designate a\ngroup as an STG after consideration of, among other things, the\ngroup's history of unlawful activity in the SCDC or other prison sys-\ntem, its history of unlawful activity in the community, its organiza-\ntional structure, and its propensity for violence. SCDC Procedure No.\nOP-21.01(OP). This designation permits penal institutions to remove\nall inmates affiliated with the STG from the general prison popula-\ntion, to reclassify them to a higher custody level, and hence to\nincrease the restrictiveness of their confinement.\n\nClassification of an individual as an STG member requires\napproval up the prison's chain of command, including the approval\nof the prison warden and the SCDC Deputy Director of Operations.\nAn inmate who is classified as an STG member is notified of that fact\nand given an opportunity to respond. An inmate may be released from\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Citations to the STG Policy and Procedure are to the versions of those\ninstruments, dated May 15, 1996, that were presented to the district court\nand to this court. There has been no suggestion that these documents are\nnot representative of the STG policy and procedure in effect in June\n1995.\n\n                     5\n\fSTG status only if the Director removes the STG designation from his\ngroup, if the SCDC finds that it has misidentified the inmate, or if the\ninmate renounces his affiliation with the group.\n\nSCDC institutions proceeded to identify individual Five Percenters\nand to adjust their security classifications. Those inmates -- number-\ning approximately three hundred at the outset and approximately\nsixty-four as of March 1997 -- were confined in administrative segre-\ngation and in maximum custody, both of which require full-time in-\ncell confinement except when the inmates shower or take recreation.\n\nIn the summer of 1995 a number of those inmates filed suits in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of South Carolina. After\ntheir cases were consolidated, the appellants filed an amended com-\nplaint asserting claims under the Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nSpecifically, the inmates alleged that the designation of the Five Per-\ncenters as an STG violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. They also claimed that their indefinite high-security\nconfinement violated the Eighth Amendment.2 Their complaint\nnamed Moore, McKellar, and William Catoe, Deputy Director for\nOperations of the SCDC, in their personal and official capacities, and\nrequested injunctive relief and damages.\n\nThe Five Percenters moved for a preliminary injunction and the\ndefendants moved for summary judgment. The district court granted\nthe defendants' motion with regard to the free exercise, equal protec-\ntion, and Eighth Amendment claims. The Five Percenters appeal.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 Appellants raised three other claims that are not at issue in this appeal.\nThe first, a challenge to a ban on the possession of Five Percenter litera-\nture, was settled by the parties after the district court enjoined the restric-\ntion. The second, based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of\n1993, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., was withdrawn in light of the Supreme\nCourt's intervening decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. 2157\n(1997). The third, based on the Due Process Clause, has been abandoned.\n3 The Five Percenters also appeal the district court's refusal to certify\na class action in this case. The court reasoned that the joinder of all par-\nties would not be impracticable, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1), and chose\ninstead to consolidate all Five Percenter cases pursuant to Rule 42(a). We\ndo not think the district court abused its discretion in declining to certify\na class. See Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc. , 158 F.3d 742, 757 (4th\nCir. 1998).\n\n                    6\n\fII.\n\nWe first address the Five Percenters' claim under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment. Although the parties vigorously dis-\npute whether the Five Percenters even constitute a religious group, the\ndistrict court did not attempt to resolve this question. Rather, the court\nassumed -- as do we -- that the Five Percenters are a religious group\nentitled to First Amendment protection. We thus avoid the \"difficult\nand delicate task\" of examining the nature and sincerity of the\ninmates' professed beliefs. Thomas v. Review Bd. , 450 U.S. 707, 714\n(1981); see Patrick v. LeFevre, 745 F.2d 153 (2d Cir. 1984).\n\nOur review of the challenged SCDC action is nevertheless highly\ndeferential. Even assuming that analogous action outside the prison\ncontext would violate the Constitution, \"when a prison regulation\nimpinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if\nit is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987); accord O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz,\n482 U.S. 342, 349 (1987); Hines v. South Carolina Dep't of\nCorrections, 148 F.3d 353, 358 (4th Cir. 1998). 4 This standard\nreflects a basic reality of conviction and confinement: Although pris-\noners are not completely without the Constitution's protection,\n\"[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limi-\ntation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the con-\nsiderations underlying our penal system.\" O'Lone, 482 U.S. at 348\n(internal quotation marks omitted). For that reason,\"once the Depart-\nment demonstrates that it is pursuing a legitimate governmental\nobjective, and demonstrates some minimally rational relationship\nbetween that objective and the means chosen to achieve that objec-\ntive, we must approve of those means.\" Hines , 148 F.3d at 358.\n\nThe rationale for judicial deference is greatest when the mainte-\nnance of prison order is at stake. By using the language of rational\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 Although the parties debate the import of Church of the Lukumi\nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993), we think it\ncontrary to the teachings of Turner to transpose the doctrine of non-\nprison cases into the prison context. Indeed, restrictions that would\nclearly violate the Constitution outside the prison setting may be ratio-\nnally based within that setting.\n\n                     7\n\fbasis scrutiny, the Supreme Court chose the most deferential possible\nstandard of review for cases presenting such issues of prison adminis-\ntration. The Supreme Court also explicitly rejected heightened judi-\ncial scrutiny of prison security policies. Rigorous scrutiny, the Court\nnoted, is simply \"not appropriate for consideration of regulations that\nare centrally concerned with the maintenance of order and security\nwithin prisons.\" Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 409-10 (1989).\n\"Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexi-\nble strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to\nanticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the\nintractable problems of prison administration.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at\n89. In the difficult and dangerous business of running a prison, front-\nline officials are best positioned to foresee threats to order and to\nfashion responses to those threats. Hence, the \"evaluation of penologi-\ncal objectives is committed to the considered judgment of prison\nadministrators, `who are actually charged with and trained in the run-\nning of the particular institution under examination.'\" O'Lone, 482\nU.S. at 349 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 562 (1979)). When\na state correctional institution is involved, the deference of a federal\ncourt is even more appropriate. Turner, 482 U.S. at 85. Prison offi-\ncials \"should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed\nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional\nsecurity.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.\n\nThe SCDC's Security Threat Group policy has exactly that objec-\ntive. According to the SCDC, the purpose of the STG policy is \"to\npromote the secure, safe, and orderly operations of all SCDC institu-\ntions, . . . to facilitate the early detection of[STG] activities and mem-\nbers and to ensure, to the extent possible, efficient intervention into\npossible volatile situations.\" SCDC Policy No. OP-21.01. These are\nnot simply legitimate penological interests -- they are compelling.\nHines, 148 F.3d at 358.\n\nThe Five Percenters do not -- and cannot -- claim that the STG\npolicy itself is not rationally related to the furtherance of the legiti-\nmate end of prison security. The STG policy requires the assessment,\nmonitoring, identification, and evaluation of all groups \"whose mem-\nbers or associates engage or have engaged in . . . planning, organiz-\ning, threatening, financing, soliciting or committing unlawful acts or\n\n                     8\n\facts of misconduct.\" SCDC Policy No. OP-21.01. And once a group\nhas been designated as an STG, its members are identified, reclassi-\nfied, and separated from the general prison population. By removing\nthose inmates who systematically engage in violence and other\nunlawful acts from the general population and by increasing the\nsecurity of their confinement, the STG policy targets a core threat to\nthe safety of both prison inmates and officials. The nexus between\nthis policy and the maintenance of prison safety is self-evident.\n\nThe Five Percenters do, however, challenge the application of the\nSTG policy to their own group. Under Turner v. Safley, several fac-\ntors \"are relevant to, and serve to channel\" our consideration of the\nrationality of the SCDC's actions. Thornburgh , 490 U.S. at 414. First,\nlike the STG policy itself, the designation of the Five Percenters as\na Security Threat Group is rationally related to the legitimate objec-\ntive of penal security. There is ample evidence in the record support-\ning the reasonableness of Moore's conclusion that the Five Percenters\nas a group posed a threat to prison safety. Five Percenters had been\ninvolved in three serious acts of violence in the SCDC system in the\nfirst four months of 1995. One of those incidents involved an assault\non fellow inmates, while the other two resulted in the hospitalization\nof prison correctional officers. Additionally, Moore presented evi-\ndence that the New Jersey Department of Corrections and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons had identified the Five Percenters as a racist, vio-\nlent group presenting an organized threat to prison security. In light\nof the information that Moore had before him, the decision to desig-\nnate the Five Percenters as an STG was eminently rational.\n\nSecond, \"other avenues remain available\" for the Five Percenters\nto exercise their religious practices in administrative segregation and\nin maximum custody. Turner, 482 U.S. at 90 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Even in high-security confinement the Five Per-\ncenters remain free to pray, fast, and study religious materials.\nAlthough the inmates are unable to participate in group meetings,\nthey are not \"deprived of all means of expression.\" O'Lone, 482 U.S.\nat 352 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThird, the accommodation of the Five Percenters' asserted rights\nwould come at too high a cost. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 90. Prison\nadministration often involves tough tradeoffs. In the closed environ-\n\n                    9\n\fment of a prison, greater liberties for some may mean increased dan-\nger and intimidation for others. Because increased freedom for the\nFive Percenters would come \"only at the cost of significantly less lib-\nerty and safety for everyone else, guards and other prisoners alike,\"\nwe are particularly reluctant to interfere with the judgment of the\nSCDC in this case. Id. at 92-93.\n\nFinally, there are no ready alternatives to the SCDC's course of\naction. See id. at 90-91. The Five Percenters urge that the SCDC\nshould only segregate an inmate after making an individual assess-\nment of that inmate's dangerousness. But this would simply reimpose\nthe regime that existed before the STG classification -- a regime that\nMoore concluded posed an unacceptable danger to corrections offi-\ncers and to other inmates. When confronted with a threat to order,\n\"[r]esponsible prison officials must be permitted to take reasonable\nsteps to forestall such a threat, and they must be permitted to act\nbefore the time when they can compile a dossier on the eve of a riot.\"\nJones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, 433 U.S. 119, 132-\n33 (1977); accord United States v. Stotts, 925 F.2d 83, 87 (4th Cir.\n1991). Allowing prison officials to act only after a demonstration of\nindividual dangerousness would deprive them of the all-important\noption of prevention. The threat of violence here was a group threat,\nand prison administrators were entitled to address it in those terms.\n\nThe Five Percenters offer three arguments why the SCDC's actions\nwere unreasonable. Initially, the inmates protest that they are not a\nracist group and that they do not promote violence. They dispute\nsome incidents reported by the SCDC, contend that others involved\nonly a few inmates, and suggest that these were isolated cases. But\nto draw these inferences in the inmates' favor would turn Turner's\ncommand of judicial deference on its head. The question is not\nwhether Moore's conclusion was indisputably correct, but whether his\nconclusion was rational and therefore entitled to deference. See Jones,\n433 U.S. at 127-28. Confronted with multiple reports of an identifi-\nable group whose members not only threatened but had actually com-\nmitted serious, violent acts in the SCDC system and elsewhere,\nMoore's decision to designate the Five Percenters as an STG was\nmanifestly a rational action.\n\nNext, the Five Percenters contend that the application of the STG\npolicy to their group is irrational because it is not \"content neutral,\"\n\n                     10\n\finasmuch as it operates against the inmates on the basis of their group\naffiliation. But Turner's only requirement of neutrality is that the\ninterest being furthered be \"unrelated to the suppression of expres-\nsion.\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Here, the STG policy is not aimed at anyone's freedom of\nexpression. Rather, it rationally furthers the neutral policy of protect-\ning prison security and order. It therefore does not violate the Consti-\ntution.\n\nThe Five Percenters finally question the SCDC's policy of releas-\ning from administrative segregation those prisoners who renounce\ntheir affiliation with the group. But since the SCDC may classify\ninmates on the basis of their affiliation with the Five Percenters,\ndeclassifying those inmates who renounce that affiliation does not\nsuddenly render the policy irrational. We do not think prison officials\nshould be in the practice of prescribing -- or proscribing -- anyone's\nprivate religious beliefs. That is not their province. But it is up to the\nSCDC to determine when an inmate is safe to return to the general\npopulation. If the SCDC wishes to hinge that determination on the\nrenunciation of affiliation with a violent -- albeit assertedly religious\n-- group, it may do so.\n\nAlthough the Five Percenters would have us second-guess the\nSCDC in this most critical area of prison security, the Constitution\ndoes not mandate such intrusion. Because the SCDC's decision to\ndesignate the Five Percenters as an STG is rationally related to the\nlegitimate end of prison safety and security, it does not offend the\nFree Exercise Clause.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Five Percenters further claim that the application of the STG\npolicy to their group violates the Equal Protection Clause. But they\noffer no evidence that similarly situated groups of inmates -- reli-\ngious or otherwise -- have been treated differently under the STG\npolicy, much less that the SCDC has acted with a discriminatory\npurpose.5 \"There is nothing in the Constitution which requires prison\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 We therefore need not proceed to the succeeding question of whether\nthe inmates' differential treatment, had it occurred, would have been\n\n                     11\n\fofficials to treat all inmate groups alike where differentiation is neces-\nsary to avoid an imminent threat of institutional disruption or vio-\nlence.\" Jones, 443 U.S. at 136. The inmates have simply failed to\nshow that the SCDC violated their equal protection rights.\n\nIV.\n\nThe Five Percenters finally contend that their long-term segregated\nconfinement violates the Eighth Amendment. The inmates complain\nthat they are confined to their cells for twenty-three hours per day\nwithout radio or television, that they receive only five hours of exer-\ncise per week, and that they may not participate in prison work,\nschool, or study programs. These conditions are indeed restrictive, but\nthe restrictive nature of high-security incarceration does not alone\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment. Sweet v. South Carolina\nDep't of Corrections, 529 F.2d 854, 857 n.1 (4th Cir. 1975) (en banc).\nTo make out a violation of the Eighth Amendment, the inmates \"must\nshow both (1) a serious deprivation of a basic human need; and (2)\ndeliberate indifference to prison conditions on the part of prison offi-\ncials.\" Strickler v. Waters, 989 F.2d 1375, 1379 (4th Cir. 1993) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry has objective and\nsubjective prongs; the Five Percenters' claim founders on both of\nthem.\n\nFirst, the Five Percenters have not shown that the conditions in\nadministrative segregation or maximum custody work a serious depri-\nvation of a basic human need. See Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337,\n347 (1981). The inmates do not contend that the SCDC has failed or\nwill fail to provide them with \"adequate food, clothing, shelter, and\nmedical care\" or to protect them from harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU.S. 825, 832 (1994). And the isolation inherent in administrative\nsegregation or maximum custody is not itself constitutionally objec-\n_________________________________________________________________\nrational under Turner. See Benjamin v. Coughlin, 905 F.2d 571, 575 (2d\nCir. 1990); see also Salaam v. Collins, 830 F. Supp. 853, 859 (D. Md.\n1993) (\"Unless . . . plaintiffs can show that the challenged regulation\nimpinges on a constitutional right -- which in an equal protection setting\nrequires a showing of discriminatory intent -- the Turner/O'Lone [stan-\ndard] is not properly invoked.\"), aff'd sub nom. Calhoun-El v. Robinson,\n70 F.3d 1261 (4th Cir. 1995) (table).\n\n                     12\n\ftionable. Indeed, this court has noted that \"isolation from companion-\nship, restriction on intellectual stimulation[,] and prolonged inactivity,\ninescapable accompaniments of segregated confinement, will not ren-\nder [that] confinement unconstitutional absent other illegitimate\ndeprivations.\" Sweet, 529 F.2d at 861 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).\n\nMoreover, the indefinite duration of the inmates' segregation does\nnot render it unconstitutional. Appellants complain that they have\nalready been confined in administrative segregation or maximum cus-\ntody for over three years, and that they do not expect to be released\nin the foreseeable future. The duration of confinement in some of\nthese cases has been long, but length of time is\"simply one consider-\nation among many\" in the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Hutto v.\nFinney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 (1978); see Sweet , 529 F.2d at 861-62.\nAlthough the Five Percenters claim that their segregation has caused\nthem to become depressed, the only evidence submitted on this point\nwere the affidavits of a few inmates asserting that the overall condi-\ntions of their confinement have placed them under\"great stress\" and\ncaused them \"great emotional and physical suffering.\" Depression and\nanxiety are unfortunate concomitants of incarceration; they do not,\nhowever, typically constitute the \"extreme deprivations . . . required\nto make out a conditions-of-confinement claim.\" Hudson v.\nMcMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1992). A depressed mental state, without\nmore, does not rise to the level of the \"serious or significant physical\nor emotional injury\" that must be shown to withstand summary judg-\nment on an Eighth Amendment charge. Strickler , 989 F.2d at 1381;\nsee Lopez v. Robinson, 914 F.2d 486, 490 (4th Cir. 1990).\n\nSecond, the SCDC has not been deliberately indifferent to the\ninmates' needs. See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 303 (1991);\nShakka v. Smith, 71 F.3d 162, 166-67 (4th Cir. 1995). In fact, the\nopposite appears to be true. The SCDC's procedures for administra-\ntive segregation provide for periodic visits by medical personnel and\nfor the referral of inmates displaying mental health problems for treat-\nment. SCDC Procedure No. 1500.13. The Five Percenters do not\nallege that these procedures have not been followed-- indeed, two\ninmates attest that they are receiving medication for their conditions,\nand another states that he has refused such attention. See Taylor v.\nFreeman, 34 F.3d 266, 271-72 (4th Cir. 1994) (finding remedial mea-\n\n                     13\n\fsures probative of a lack of official indifference). Since the Five Per-\ncenters have failed to \"come forward with evidence from which it can\nbe inferred that the defendant-officials were . . . knowingly and unrea-\nsonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of harm,\" Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 845-46, summary judgment on this claim was likewise\nproper on the basis of the defendants' state of mind.\n\nV.\n\nIn sum, we hold that the long-term segregation of the Five Per-\ncenters is rationally based, and therefore that it does not violate the\nFree Exercise Clause. We further hold that the SCDC has not violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause or the Eighth Amendment. 6 We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nAFFIRMED\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 Since we hold that there has been no constitutional violation, there is\nno need to address the qualified immunity of the individual defendants.\n\n                    14\n\f",

Lide, LIDE, MONTGOMERY & POTTS,\nP.C., Columbia, South Carolina, for Appellees.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nWILKINSON, Chief Judge:\n\nAfter a series of violent prison incidents involving members of the\nFive Percent Nation of Islam (the Five Percenters), the South Carolina\nDepartment of Corrections (SCDC) classified the Five Percenters as\na Security Threat Group (STG). Acting under its Security Threat\nGroup policy, the SCDC then transferred all Five Percenters to\nadministrative segregation or to maximum custody confinement. A\nnumber of those inmates filed suit, raising challenges to this policy\nunder the Free Exercise Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the\nEighth Amendment of the Constitution. The district court granted\nsummary judgment to the defendant officials of the SCDC, and the\ninmates appeal. Because the designation of the Five Percenters as an\nSTG was a rational response to a threat to prison safety -- a concern\npeculiarly within the province of penal authorities-- we affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\nI.\n\nThis case concerns the long-term segregation under the SCDC's\nSecurity Threat Group policy of inmates affiliated with the Five Per-\ncenters, a group which appellants describe as a religious sect and\nwhich appellees claim is a violent gang. In fact, it was the history of\nviolence involving Five Percenters that led to the group's classifica-\ntion as a security threat. In early 1995 three such incidents occurred\n\n                    3\n\fin SCDC facilities. That January a group of Five Percenters assaulted\nthree other inmates at Lieber Correctional Institution, requiring the\nintervention of corrections personnel. In a second incident that same\nmonth, a group of Five Percenters attacked three correctional officers\nat the Allendale Correctional Institution, beating those officers with\ntheir own batons and assaulting them with their own pepper spray. As\na result, each of the victims was hospitalized. The incident report for\nthe Allendale attack reported that \"these five inmates acted as a\ngroup,\" that they \"felt as if they were acting in a manner acceptable\nto the[ir] religious beliefs,\" and that they \"spoke of more violence to\ncome.\"\n\nThe third, most serious incident occurred in April 1995, when six\nFive Percenters and one other inmate staged a riot in the Broad River\nCorrectional Institution. Wielding knives, softball bats, and a variety\nof improvised weapons, the inmates attacked and severely injured\nseveral correctional officers in the prison cafeteria and yard. The\ninmates then seized one officer and two food service employees as\nhostages, leading to an eleven-hour standoff with law enforcement\npersonnel. Four officers were hospitalized as a result of these events.\n\nThe SCDC's problems with the Five Percenters were neither new\nnor unique. In 1992 an inmate in the Central Correctional Institution\nreported being stabbed and beaten by a group of Five Percenters. Fur-\nthermore, according to the unit manager of the Lee Correctional Insti-\ntution, a group of Five Percenters had been active in that facility as\nearly as 1993, stealing from and preying on weaker inmates and on\none occasion attempting to start a riot. In addition, SCDC Director\nMichael Moore learned that the Five Percenters had been active in\nprison systems in New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Vir-\nginia.\n\nOn June 16, 1995, SCDC Director of Security Kenneth McKellar\nsent Moore a memorandum referring generally to the Five Percenters'\nhistory of violence and describing specifically the Broad River hos-\ntage taking. In addition, the memorandum informed Moore that both\nthe New Jersey Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons had classified the Five Percenters as a threat group. McKellar\nattached to this memo a New Jersey intelligence report describing the\nFive Percenters as \"a group of individuals who espouse violence as\n\n                    4\n\fa means to an end.\" A federal intelligence summary, also obtained by\nthe SCDC, called the Five Percenters a \"radical Islamic sect/criminal\ngroup\" that \"is often boldly racist in its views, prolific in its criminal\nactivities, and operates behind a facade of cultural and religious rheto-\nric.\" Based on this information and the SCDC's own experience,\nMcKellar recommended and Moore approved the designation of the\nFive Percenters as an STG in South Carolina.\n\nThe SCDC's Security Threat Group policy defines an STG as\n\n          any formal or informal organization, association, or group of\n          three (3) or more inmates that have a common name, and\n          whose members or associates engage or have engaged in\n          two (2) or more activities that include planning, organizing,\n          threatening, financing, soliciting or committing unlawful\n          acts or acts of misconduct classified as serious threats or\n          potential threats to the safety and security of the public, the\n          Department, employees, visitors and/or other inmates.\n\nSCDC Policy No. OP-21.01.1 The SCDC Director may designate a\ngroup as an STG after consideration of, among other things, the\ngroup's history of unlawful activity in the SCDC or other prison sys-\ntem, its history of unlawful activity in the community, its organiza-\ntional structure, and its propensity for violence. SCDC Procedure No.\nOP-21.01(OP). This designation permits penal institutions to remove\nall inmates affiliated with the STG from the general prison popula-\ntion, to reclassify them to a higher custody level, and hence to\nincrease the restrictiveness of their confinement.\n\nClassification of an individual as an STG member requires\napproval up the prison's chain of command, including the approval\nof the prison warden and the SCDC Deputy Director of Operations.\nAn inmate who is classified as an STG member is notified of that fact\nand given an opportunity to respond. An inmate may be released from\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Citations to the STG Policy and Procedure are to the versions of those\ninstruments, dated May 15, 1996, that were presented to the district court\nand to this court. There has been no suggestion that these documents are\nnot representative of the STG policy and procedure in effect in June\n1995.\n\n                     5\n\fSTG status only if the Director removes the STG designation from his\ngroup, if the SCDC finds that it has misidentified the inmate, or if the\ninmate renounces his affiliation with the group.\n\nSCDC institutions proceeded to identify individual Five Percenters\nand to adjust their security classifications. Those inmates -- number-\ning approximately three hundred at the outset and approximately\nsixty-four as of March 1997 -- were confined in administrative segre-\ngation and in maximum custody, both of which require full-time in-\ncell confinement except when the inmates shower or take recreation.\n\nIn the summer of 1995 a number of those inmates filed suits in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of South Carolina. After\ntheir cases were consolidated, the appellants filed an amended com-\nplaint asserting claims under the Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nSpecifically, the inmates alleged that the designation of the Five Per-\ncenters as an STG violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. They also claimed that their indefinite high-security\nconfinement violated the Eighth Amendment.2 Their complaint\nnamed Moore, McKellar, and William Catoe, Deputy Director for\nOperations of the SCDC, in their personal and official capacities, and\nrequested injunctive relief and damages.\n\nThe Five Percenters moved for a preliminary injunction and the\ndefendants moved for summary judgment. The district court granted\nthe defendants' motion with regard to the free exercise, equal protec-\ntion, and Eighth Amendment claims. The Five Percenters appeal.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 Appellants raised three other claims that are not at issue in this appeal.\nThe first, a challenge to a ban on the possession of Five Percenter litera-\nture, was settled by the parties after the district court enjoined the restric-\ntion. The second, based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of\n1993, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., was withdrawn in light of the Supreme\nCourt's intervening decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The third, based on the Due Process Clause, has been abandoned.\n3 The Five Percenters also appeal the district court's refusal to certify\na class action in this case. The court reasoned that the joinder of all par-\nties would not be impracticable, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1), and chose\ninstead to consolidate all Five Percenter cases pursuant to Rule 42(a). We\ndo not think the district court abused its discretion in declining to certify\na class. See Lowery v.

Although the parties vigorously dis-\npute whether the Five Percenters even constitute a religious group, the\ndistrict court did not attempt to resolve this question. Rather, the court\nassumed -- as do we -- that the Five Percenters are a religious group\nentitled to First Amendment protection. We thus avoid the \"difficult\nand delicate task\" of examining the nature and sincerity of the\ninmates' professed beliefs. Thomas v.

Indeed, restrictions that would\nclearly violate the Constitution outside the prison setting may be ratio-\nnally based within that setting.\n\n                     7\n\fbasis scrutiny, the Supreme Court chose the most deferential possible\nstandard of review for cases presenting such issues of prison adminis-\ntration. The Supreme Court also explicitly rejected heightened judi-\ncial scrutiny of prison security policies. Rigorous scrutiny, the Court\nnoted, is simply \"not appropriate for consideration of regulations that\nare centrally concerned with the maintenance of order and security\nwithin prisons.\" Thornburgh v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409-10 (1989).\n\"Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexi-\nble strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to\nanticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the\nintractable problems of prison administration.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at\n89. In the difficult and dangerous business of running a prison, front-\nline officials are best positioned to foresee threats to order and to\nfashion responses to those threats. Hence, the \"evaluation of penologi-\ncal objectives is committed to the considered judgment of prison\nadministrators, `who are actually charged with and trained in the run-\nning of the particular institution under examination.'\" O'Lone, 482\nU.S. at 349 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (1979)). When\na state correctional institution is involved, the deference of a federal\ncourt is even more appropriate. Turner, 482 U.S. at 85. Prison offi-\ncials \"should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed\nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional\nsecurity.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.\n\nThe SCDC's Security Threat Group policy has exactly that objec-\ntive. According to the SCDC, the purpose of the STG policy is \"to\npromote the secure, safe, and orderly operations of all SCDC institu-\ntions, . . . to facilitate the early detection of[STG] activities and mem-\nbers and to ensure, to the extent possible, efficient intervention into\npossible volatile situations.\" SCDC Policy No. OP-21.01. These are\nnot simply legitimate penological interests -- they are compelling.\nHines, 148 F.3d at 358.\n\nThe Five Percenters do not -- and cannot -- claim that the STG\npolicy itself is not rationally related to the furtherance of the legiti-\nmate end of prison security. The STG policy requires the assessment,\nmonitoring, identification, and evaluation of all groups \"whose mem-\nbers or associates engage or have engaged in . . . planning, organiz-\ning, threatening, financing, soliciting or committing unlawful acts or\n\n                     8\n\facts of misconduct.\" SCDC Policy No. OP-21.01. And once a group\nhas been designated as an STG, its members are identified, reclassi-\nfied, and separated from the general prison population. By removing\nthose inmates who systematically engage in violence and other\nunlawful acts from the general population and by increasing the\nsecurity of their confinement, the STG policy targets a core threat to\nthe safety of both prison inmates and officials. The nexus between\nthis policy and the maintenance of prison safety is self-evident.\n\nThe Five Percenters do, however, challenge the application of the\nSTG policy to their own group. Under Turner v. Safley, several fac-\ntors \"are relevant to, and serve to channel\" our consideration of the\nrationality of the SCDC's actions. Thornburgh , 490 U.S. at 414. First,\nlike the STG policy itself, the designation of the Five Percenters as\na Security Threat Group is rationally related to the legitimate objec-\ntive of penal security. There is ample evidence in the record support-\ning the reasonableness of Moore's conclusion that the Five Percenters\nas a group posed a threat to prison safety. Five Percenters had been\ninvolved in three serious acts of violence in the SCDC system in the\nfirst four months of 1995. One of those incidents involved an assault\non fellow inmates, while the other two resulted in the hospitalization\nof prison correctional officers. Additionally, Moore presented evi-\ndence that the New Jersey Department of Corrections and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons had identified the Five Percenters as a racist, vio-\nlent group presenting an organized threat to prison security. In light\nof the information that Moore had before him, the decision to desig-\nnate the Five Percenters as an STG was eminently rational.\n\nSecond, \"other avenues remain available\" for the Five Percenters\nto exercise their religious practices in administrative segregation and\nin maximum custody. Turner, 482 U.S. at 90 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Even in high-security confinement the Five Per-\ncenters remain free to pray, fast, and study religious materials.\nAlthough the inmates are unable to participate in group meetings,\nthey are not \"deprived of all means of expression.\" O'Lone, 482 U.S.\nat 352 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThird, the accommodation of the Five Percenters' asserted rights\nwould come at too high a cost. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 90. Prison\nadministration often involves tough tradeoffs. In the closed environ-\n\n                    9\n\fment of a prison, greater liberties for some may mean increased dan-\nger and intimidation for others. Because increased freedom for the\nFive Percenters would come \"only at the cost of significantly less lib-\nerty and safety for everyone else, guards and other prisoners alike,\"\nwe are particularly reluctant to interfere with the judgment of the\nSCDC in this case. Id. at 92-93.\n\nFinally, there are no ready alternatives to the SCDC's course of\naction. See id. at 90-91. The Five Percenters urge that the SCDC\nshould only segregate an inmate after making an individual assess-\nment of that inmate's dangerousness. But this would simply reimpose\nthe regime that existed before the STG classification -- a regime that\nMoore concluded posed an unacceptable danger to corrections offi-\ncers and to other inmates. When confronted with a threat to order,\n\"[r]esponsible prison officials must be permitted to take reasonable\nsteps to forestall such a threat, and they must be permitted to act\nbefore the time when they can compile a dossier on the eve of a riot.\"\nJones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109718\"><a href=\"/opinion/109718/jones-v-north-carolina-prisoners-labor-union-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132-\n33 (1977); accord United States v.

Allowing prison officials to act only after a demonstration of\nindividual dangerousness would deprive them of the all-important\noption of prevention. The threat of violence here was a group threat,\nand prison administrators were entitled to address it in those terms.\n\nThe Five Percenters offer three arguments why the SCDC's actions\nwere unreasonable. Initially, the inmates protest that they are not a\nracist group and that they do not promote violence. They dispute\nsome incidents reported by the SCDC, contend that others involved\nonly a few inmates, and suggest that these were isolated cases. But\nto draw these inferences in the inmates' favor would turn Turner's\ncommand of judicial deference on its head. The question is not\nwhether Moore's conclusion was indisputably correct, but whether his\nconclusion was rational and therefore entitled to deference. See Jones,\n433 U.S. at 127-28. Confronted with multiple reports of an identifi-\nable group whose members not only threatened but had actually com-\nmitted serious, violent acts in the SCDC system and elsewhere,\nMoore's decision to designate the Five Percenters as an STG was\nmanifestly a rational action.\n\nNext, the Five Percenters contend that the application of the STG\npolicy to their group is irrational because it is not \"content neutral,\"\n\n                     10\n\finasmuch as it operates against the inmates on the basis of their group\naffiliation. But Turner's only requirement of neutrality is that the\ninterest being furthered be \"unrelated to the suppression of expres-\nsion.\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Here, the STG policy is not aimed at anyone's freedom of\nexpression. Rather, it rationally furthers the neutral policy of protect-\ning prison security and order. It therefore does not violate the Consti-\ntution.\n\nThe Five Percenters finally question the SCDC's policy of releas-\ning from administrative segregation those prisoners who renounce\ntheir affiliation with the group. But since the SCDC may classify\ninmates on the basis of their affiliation with the Five Percenters,\ndeclassifying those inmates who renounce that affiliation does not\nsuddenly render the policy irrational. We do not think prison officials\nshould be in the practice of prescribing -- or proscribing -- anyone's\nprivate religious beliefs. That is not their province. But it is up to the\nSCDC to determine when an inmate is safe to return to the general\npopulation. If the SCDC wishes to hinge that determination on the\nrenunciation of affiliation with a violent -- albeit assertedly religious\n-- group, it may do so.\n\nAlthough the Five Percenters would have us second-guess the\nSCDC in this most critical area of prison security, the Constitution\ndoes not mandate such intrusion. Because the SCDC's decision to\ndesignate the Five Percenters as an STG is rationally related to the\nlegitimate end of prison safety and security, it does not offend the\nFree Exercise Clause.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Five Percenters further claim that the application of the STG\npolicy to their group violates the Equal Protection Clause. But they\noffer no evidence that similarly situated groups of inmates -- reli-\ngious or otherwise -- have been treated differently under the STG\npolicy, much less that the SCDC has acted with a discriminatory\npurpose.5 \"There is nothing in the Constitution which requires prison\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 We therefore need not proceed to the succeeding question of whether\nthe inmates' differential treatment, had it occurred, would have been\n\n                     11\n\fofficials to treat all inmate groups alike where differentiation is neces-\nsary to avoid an imminent threat of institutional disruption or vio-\nlence.\" Jones, 443 U.S. at 136. The inmates have simply failed to\nshow that the SCDC violated their equal protection rights.\n\nIV.\n\nThe Five Percenters finally contend that their long-term segregated\nconfinement violates the Eighth Amendment. The inmates complain\nthat they are confined to their cells for twenty-three hours per day\nwithout radio or television, that they receive only five hours of exer-\ncise per week, and that they may not participate in prison work,\nschool, or study programs. These conditions are indeed restrictive, but\nthe restrictive nature of high-security incarceration does not alone\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment. Sweet v.

This inquiry has objective and\nsubjective prongs; the Five Percenters' claim founders on both of\nthem.\n\nFirst, the Five Percenters have not shown that the conditions in\nadministrative segregation or maximum custody work a serious depri-\nvation of a basic human need. See Rhodes v. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n347 (1981). The inmates do not contend that the SCDC has failed or\nwill fail to provide them with \"adequate food, clothing, shelter, and\nmedical care\" or to protect them from harm. Farmer v.

Indeed, this court has noted that \"isolation from companion-\nship, restriction on intellectual stimulation[,] and prolonged inactivity,\ninescapable accompaniments of segregated confinement, will not ren-\nder [that] confinement unconstitutional absent other illegitimate\ndeprivations.\" Sweet, 529 F.2d at 861 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).\n\nMoreover, the indefinite duration of the inmates' segregation does\nnot render it unconstitutional. Appellants complain that they have\nalready been confined in administrative segregation or maximum cus-\ntody for over three years, and that they do not expect to be released\nin the foreseeable future. The duration of confinement in some of\nthese cases has been long, but length of time is\"simply one consider-\nation among many\" in the Eighth Amendment inquiry.

A depressed mental state, without\nmore, does not rise to the level of the \"serious or significant physical\nor emotional injury\" that must be shown to withstand summary judg-\nment on an Eighth Amendment charge. Strickler , 989 F.2d at 1381;\nsee Lopez v.

See Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (1991);\nShakka v.

In fact, the\nopposite appears to be true. The SCDC's procedures for administra-\ntive segregation provide for periodic visits by medical personnel and\nfor the referral of inmates displaying mental health problems for treat-\nment. SCDC Procedure No. 1500.13. The Five Percenters do not\nallege that these procedures have not been followed-- indeed, two\ninmates attest that they are receiving medication for their conditions,\nand another states that he has refused such attention. See Taylor v.\nFreeman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677346\"><a href=\"/opinion/677346/isreal-taylor-dannon-mourfield-donald-guy-wayne-moore-and-jimmy-jordan-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 271-72 (4th Cir. 1994) (finding remedial mea-\n\n                     13\n\fsures probative of a lack of official indifference). Since the Five Per-\ncenters have failed to \"come forward with evidence from which it can\nbe inferred that the defendant-officials were . . . knowingly and unrea-\nsonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of harm,\" Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 845-46, summary judgment on this claim was likewise\nproper on the basis of the defendants' state of mind.\n\nV.\n\nIn sum, we hold that the long-term segregation of the Five Per-\ncenters is rationally based, and therefore that it does not violate the\nFree Exercise Clause. We further hold that the SCDC has not violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause or the Eighth Amendment. 6 We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nAFFIRMED\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 Since we hold that there has been no constitutional violation, there is\nno need to address the qualified immunity of the individual defendants.\n\n                    14\n\f</pre>",
