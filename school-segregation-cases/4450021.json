Venue in Dallas County is proper in this cause under Section 15 .002( a)(2) of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because Defendant resides in this county.\n\n                                                FACTS\n\n         8.       Plaintiff and his wife are the owners of certain real property in Van Zandt County.\n\nPart of the property is a private driveway from their home entering onto Van Zandt County\n\nRoad 2319.\n\n         9.       Unknown to Plaintiff, Defendant Petruska and his wife had fraudulently filed\n\ndocuments in the real property records of Van Zandt County claiming an easement to use\n\nPlaintiffs driveway. No such easement existed.\n\n         10.      On or about February 14, 2014, Defendant Petruska was informed that Plaintiff\n\nwould be erecting a barrier along the driveway which would preclude any access from\n\nDefendant's property to the driveway. On or about February 15, 2014, Plaintiff was on his\n\ntractor transporting supplies for fencing on the driveway when he was met on the driveway by\n\nDefendant Petruska.\n\n         11.      Defendant Petruska began arguing with Plaintiff about an alleged right to use the\n\ndriveway which Plaintiff explicitly stated did not exist. Defendant Petruska then returned to his\n\nvehicle to get a weapon, what to Plaintiff appeared to be an ARI 5 assault weapon. Defendant\n\nPetruska walked onto Plaintiffs property and pointed the weapon directly at Plaintiff who was\n\nonly about ten (10) feet away, declaring he had a right to use Plaintiffs driveway. Defendant\n\nPetruska went on to tell Plaintiff that he was a Veteran of the war in Vietnam and suffered from\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder. Defendant stated, while pointing the weapon at Plaintiff, \"I've\n\nkilled a lot of men and you have not killed any and I am going to kill you.\" Plaintiff, in fear for\n\nhis life, put his arms in the air and told Defendant Petruska he was calling law enforcement on\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S ORIGINAL PETITION                                                                 Page 2\n\\\\Bdnt-fsl \\wpprolaw\\3191.003\\259143.docx\n                                                                                             RPI 0003\n\fhis mobile phone.         In response, Defendant Petruska walked across the property line to his\n\nproperty, still holding his weapon, and dared Plaintiff to call the Sheriff. Plaintiff quickly got on\n\nthe tractor and drove back to his house and called the Sheriff.\n\n                                      THREAT OF BODILY INJURY\n\n         12.      Defendant intentionally and knowingly threatened Plaintiff with imminent bodily\n\ninjury. Defendant pointed an assault rifle at Plaintiff from less than 10 feet away, and threatened\n\nPlaintiff with imminent bodily injury, expressing his intent shoot and to kill Plaintiff. Defendant\n\nstated to Plaintiff that Defendant had killed people in the past and that he suffered from a mental\n\ndisorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Plaintiff was in fear that he would be shot.\n\n         13.      Defendant's threat directly and proximately caused injury to Plaintiff. Plaintiff\n\ncontinues to suffer from apprehension that Defendant will cause him injury. When Defendant\n\nvisits the property Plaintiff feels forced to stay out of sight and to avoid any contact with\n\nDefendant.      This fear and apprehension has caused Plaintiff to suffer from nightmares and\n\ninsomnia, fear of leaving his home and inability to focus on anything other than the incident and\n\nsafety of his home and his wife at the times Defendant is at his home. Plaintiff now feels the\n\nneed to sleep with a weapon nearby. This severe apprehension and fear has caused damage\n\nincluding past and future pain and suffering, past and future mental anguish, loss of income,\n\nphysical impairment, past and future medical expenses and loss of consortium.\n\n                                            EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n\n         14.      Plaintiff would further show that Plaintiffs injuries resulted from Defendant's\n\nmalice. Defendant acted with the specific intent to cause substantial injury and/or harm to\n\nPlaintiff and to intimidate Plaintiff in granting Defendant a right to use Plaintiffs property. It\n\nwas Defendant's intent to intimidate Plaintiff into believing that an easement existed by utilizing\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S ORIGINAL PETITION                                                                 Page 3\n\\\\Bdnt-fsl \\wpprolaw\\3191.003\\259143.docx\n\n                                                                                             RPI 0004\n\fa deadly weapon to instill fear in Plaintiff, thus causing harm to Plaintiff.            Plaintiff seeks\n\nrecovery from Defendant for exemplary damages as provided by Section 41.003(a) of the Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code. As Defendant's conduct is described by the Texas Penal\n\nCode § 22.02 as an aggravated assault, the limitation of damages in Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code § 41.008 does not apply.\n\n                                            JURY DEMAND\n\n         15.      Plaintiff demands a jury trial and tenders the appropriate fee with this petition.\n\n                                      REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE\n\n         17.

Robert L. Johns,...\n\n                                                               3                                                     See More Trial Court Documents\n\n              In ruling on a motion for stay, the court should also weigh the private interests of the\n              plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously against the prejudice that will be caused by the\n              delay that will result from the stay. Plaintiffs assert that the criminal case against Nichols\n              is proceeding slowly and uncertainly, with no specific trial date. Nevertheless, Texas law\n              recognizes a right to a speedy trial. Therefore, the court concludes that consideration of\n              the burden to be placed on the plaintiffs does not weigh heavily against a stay.\n\n              The court recognizes that, even if convicted, Nichols' Fifth Amendment privilege may\n              continue throughout the pendency of his direct appeal. See, e.g., Frank v. United States,\n              347 F.2d 486, 491 (D.C.Cir.1965). Because the issuance and duration of a stay are\n              committed to the court's sound discretion, and because imposition of a stay lasting\n              throughout the duration of Nichols' direct appeal (if he is convicted) would likely be unduly\n              burdensome to plaintiffs' interests, the court contemplates that the stay granted today will\n              remain in effect only through sentencing. If he is acquitted, the stay will terminate upon\n              the return of a not guilty verdict.\n\n                                                               4\n              *3 The court has also considered the private interest of MSC in securing the stay and the\n              burden on it that would result were the stay denied. As discussed above, absent a stay,\n              Nichols faces a conflict between asserting his Fifth Amendment rights and fulfilling his\n              legal obligations as a witness in this civil action. This conflict may be largely, if not\n              completely, eliminated by granting a stay of appropriate scope. Moreover, the court\n              discerns no substantial prejudice to plaintiffs from granting a partial stay. Therefore, the\n              court finds that MSC's private interest weighs in favor of abatement in part.\n\n                                                             5\n              Because the court concludes that granting a stay will not unduly interfere with the court's\n              management of its docket, it finds that the court's interests do not weigh against a stay.\n              Additionally, the court holds that the interests of the public do not weigh against a stay.\n\n                                                           6\n              MSC seeks abatement of the entire suit, contending that Nichols is unable to participate\n              in discovery or in MSC's defense, thereby compromising its ability to defend itself. The\n              court is not persuaded that all discovery must be halted. There would appear to be a\n              great deal of discovery that both parties could undertake, including that concerning the\n              physical evidence from the accident, the extent, nature, and costs of the medical\n

              the extent that plaintiffs are precluded from taking Nichols' deposition and from\n               conducting any discovery that MSC can show, by motion, will or is likely to subject it to\n               undue prejudice by reason of Nichols' unavailability as a witness to MSC or to assist it in\n               its defense.\n\n               Based on its consideration of the above factors, and in the interests of justice, the court\n               grants in part MSC's motion to abate and, to the extent set forth above, abates discovery\n               in this case until such time as a verdict of not guilty has been returned or sentencing has\n

The court grants the request for ruling, and decides the motion today.\n\n                3             The court will not organize its analysis based on plaintiffs' arguments,\n

               on the personal nature of the Fifth Amendment privilege. While it is true that\n                              MSC cannot invoked Nichols' right against self-incrimination, it can certainly\n                              rely on the fact that he has that right to seek a stay of discovery.\n\n                4

References to \"Cmplt.\" are to the amended complaint\n2            Plaintiffs allege that Transworld Plumbing and Danica Mechanical are alter egos of the other corporate defendants\n             and share common ownership, management, facilities, equipment, employees, etc. Plaintiffs also allege that the\n             Andreadakises are the controlling officers of the corporate defendants. (Cmplt.111111-12, 18 and 21 ).\n3        Pursuant to a request made by my law clerk, counsel for defendants advised this Court that Judge Fried had issued an\n         opinion in the Criminal Case dismissing 25 counts. The remaining counts, however, contain allegations that are similar\n         to those present in the civil case .\n4            Plaintiffs assert that defendants' interests in not being forced to choose between asserting their Fifth Amendment rights\n             or defending the civil action are insufficient to warrant a stay. Plaintiffs argue that it is not unconstitutional to force a litigant\n         to choose between invoking his Fifth Amendment rights and risking adverse consequences in a civil action, or engaging\n         in discovery in the civil case and risking conviction . See. e.g .. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S.Ct. 1551,\n         1558, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976) ; United States v.

Even if a court may constitutionally deny a request for a stay, however, a stay of a\n         civil action may still be warranted in some instances.\n5            See Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings , 129 F.R.D. 201 (Pollack, J.)

Boesky, 660 F.Supp. 1494, 1497\n         (S.D.N.Y.1987)).\n            A fifth factor often cited by courts in this Circuit, the interests of persons not party to the civil litigation, is not applicable\n            here and has not been raised by the parties.\n8        In response to an inquiry by my law clerk, plaintiffs' counsel cautioned that the trial might not commence before late\n         1995 or early 1996.\n9        Most of the cases cited by plaintiffs for its assertion that judicial efficiency would not be achieved by a stay are inapplicable\n         since they either concern a pre-indictment motion for stay, a motion for stay after the defendant has pleaded guilty\n         in the criminal case, thereby eliminating any Fifth Amendment concerns, or a civil case involving different issues than\n         those present in the criminal case . See. e.g., United States v. Private Sanitation Industry Assoc., 811 F.Supp . 802\n         (S.D.N.Y.1992)( pre-indictment motion); Arden Way Assoc. v. Boesky, 660 F.Supp. 1494(S.D.N.Y.1987) (motion for stay\n         after guilty plea entered); FDIC v. Renda, 1987 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 8305 \"13(D.Kan .1987) (little overlap of issues between\n         civil and criminal case).\n10       Indeed, plaintiffs state in their memorandum of law that \"it may well be necessary to eventually depose the indicted\n         defendant officers.\" (Pl _Mern . at 21 ). Plaintiffs also assert that \"it is not at all clear at this stage how significant [the indicted\n         defendants') depositions will be to the lawsuit.\" This argument, however, is rejected as the Andreadakises, as controlling\n         officers of the corporate defendants, are principal characters in this case and their testimony will undoubtedly be critical.\n11       The fact that the other two defendants, Transworld Mechanical and Transworld Plumbing & Heating, Inc., were not\n         indicted does not weigh against a stay since plaintiffs themselves allege that all four entities are \"affiliated business\n         enterprises and alter ego of each other.\" (Cmplt.1126). See United States v. Certain Real Property, 751 F.Supp . 1060,\n         1063 (E.D.N.Y.1989) (staying case for both defendants although only one had been indicted).\n12       Defendants maintain that a stay is also warranted because there is an issue as to whether this Court or the National\n         Labor Relations Board has jurisdiction over this case which ca~ only be resolved after substantial discovery has been\n         completed. Plaintiffs counter that a \"potential question\" as to jurisdiction does not form the basis for a stay. As I have\n         granted the stay pending the resolution of the Criminal Case, I do not need to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\n\n     r        r f,.· 1\n                                                                                                                                   RPI 0243\n         1\n\fTrustees of Plumbers and Pipefitters Nat.

Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 461 (2d Cir.1991 ).\n             18 U.S.C. § 664 prohibits the embezzlement or conversion of any funds or assets of any employee welfare benefit plan\n             or employee pension benefit plan or any fund connected to either plan.\n15        The Supreme Court in HJ. Inc., while recognizing that continuity would be analyzed on a case by case basis, nevertheless\n          strove to give some guidance with respect to the concept of continuity, and stated that \"continuity is sufficiently established\n          where the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as part of a long-term association that exists for criminal\n          purposes .. . [orJ where it is shown that the predicate acts are a regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate\n          business (in the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating in an\n          ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'\" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 243, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.\n16        Defendants' reliance on First Nationwide Bank v. Gett Funding, Corp., 820 F.Supp. 89 (S.D.N.Y.1993), aff'd, 27 F.3d 763\n          (2d Cir.1994) , is misplaced. The alleged enterprise in First Nationwide was simply the association of a mortgage broker\n          and different borrowers who had engaged in a series of unrelated loan transactions. Not surprisingly, the district court\n          held that plaintiff had not alleged an enterprise since he failed to specify the structure or personnel of the enterprise or\n          how the various defendants came together as a group. Id. at 98.\n            Here, defendants are not unrelated entities, but are closely affiliated: plaintiffs have alleged that the individual\n            defendants are the controlling officers of the corporate defendants and that the corporate defendants are alter egos of\n            one another. Thus, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged an enterprise .\n17        See Center Cadillac, 808 F.Supp. at 230 (citation omitted).\n18        Section 1964(c) of RICO provides that:\n                 Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue\n                 therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains ...\n            Thus, to have standing to bring a civil RICO claim, plaintiffs must show that defendants' violation of section 1962 caused\n            an injury to their business or property. See Sedima SPRL, 473 US. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275; First Nationwide Bank v.\n            Gett Funding Corp , 27 F.3d 763, 767 (2d Cir.1994) (citing Hecht v.

The plaintiff in Bankers Trust, alleged that\n          it was fraudulently induced by a bankrupt corporation's officers into accepting only 17.5% of its outstanding claim from\n          the corporation. In dismissing the portion of the RICO claim seeking repayment of a lost debt, the appeals court held\n          that the lost debt damages were too speculative to state a claim since the plaintiffs RICO injuries could be reduced or\n          magnified depending on the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings\n            In First Nationwide, the plaintiff bank's RICO claim that borrowers fraudulently induced it to make nonrecourse loans\n            was dismissed where the bank had not yet attempted to foreclose on the loans. The appeals court noted that any loss\n            with respect to the loans could not be determined until the bank attempted foreclosure and \"only when [the bank's]\n            actual loss becomes clear and definite will the claims be ripe for suit\". 27 F.3d at768-69.\n\n\nEnd of Do cument                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters No claim to original U .S Government Works\n\n\n\n\n  ~   I     t'.Jc..'.1                                                 II\n                                                                                                                             RPI 0244\n\f72                            218 FEDERAL RULES DECISIONS\n\n Plaintiffs Response at 4 (emphasis added).          for sanctions, available to a prevailing party\n Contrary to the assertions in McGirr's Sup-         pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, shall be filed by\n plemental Declaration, Ms. Tharp, Plaintiffs        Defendant within 10 days of service of this\nVice President for Manufacturing testified,          Decision and Order.

Defendant\n    officer sought a stay of further discovery until the completion of criminal proceedings against him.\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    Plaintiff officer claimed that defendant officer harassed her. Defendant officer was indicted on a misdemeanor charge of official oppression for the same alleged\n    harassment. Defendant officer sought a stay of further discovery and a protective order shielding him from having to produce information that he believed would\n    implicate his Fifth Amendment privilege. The city was willing to produce all responsive information, even that which might have implicated defendant officer's privilege. Jn\n    g1anting defendant officer's request for a stay, the court held that several factors weighed in favor of a stay, including the degree to which the civil issues overlapped with\n    the criminal issues and the fact that defendant officer had been indicted for the same conduct that was the subject of the civil case. The court held that, with respect to\n    compelled statements made by defendant officer to the city's internal affairs investigators, if the statements were provided to the prosecution, allowing plaintiff officer to\n    discover them would not have violated defendant officer's Fif\\h Amendment privilege because the privilege only guarded against the improper use of the compelled\n    statements.\n\n\n\n\n    Outcome\n\n    The court ordered defendants to produce, with exceptions, all documents that had been submitted for in camera review. The court stayed further discovery from\n    defendant officer until he was convicted and sentenced, acquitted, or the charges were dropped in the state criminal proceeding .\n\n\n\n\n    ., LexisNexis® Headnotes\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                RPI 0250\n\fCivil Procedure   > ... >   ~ ...        > Pri vjleged Commu njcatlons • > General Overy jew ...\nConstitutional Law> ... > Eu r1da m enta!

Even where <i party has a legitimate claim of privilege with respect\nto certain questions or lines of Inquiry, that person may not be entitled to invoke his privilege to remain totally silent. Only where the court finds that he could\n!eg1tlmate!y refuse to answer essentially all relevant questions, because or the threat of incrimination from any relevant questioning is a person totally excused from\nresponding to relevant inquiries. Otherwise, a person Is entitled to invoke the privilege only as to genuinely tlireatening questions. A blanket assertion of the privilege\nwithout inquiry by the court is unacceptable. The court may conduct an in camera review of the items at issue to determine 1f the privilege applies. If, after such a\nreview, the court finds that the prlvilege is well·founded, the court may stay or postpone civil discovery or issue                     a protective   order.

In deciding whether to stay discovery in light of a party's Firth A1pendrn1:nt privilege, a court must balance the interests of the party asserting the privilege\nagainst any preiudice resulting to the other parties. To achieve that balance, the court uses a six-factor test: (1) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case\noverlap with those presented In the civil case; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendants have been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously, weighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; (4) the private Interests of and burden on the defendants; (5) the\ninterests of the courts; and (6) the public Interest.

A stay of\na civil case is most appropriate where a party to the civil case has already been indicted for the same conduct for two reasons: first, the likelihood that• defendant may\nmake incriminating statements is greetest after an indictment has issued, and second, the prejudice to the plaintiffs in the civil case is reduced since the criminal case\nwill likely be quickly resolved due to Speedy Trial Act consider•tions.

BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 24, 2002, Jessica Frierson (Plaintiff), an officer with the Terrell Police Department, initiated this civil action against the City oflerrell (City) and another officer,\nAlejandro Suarez (Officer), for alleged harassment under •12 V S.C. § 1983. On or about October 10, 2001, Office1 was indicted m state court on a class A m1Sdemeanor charge\nof Officral Oppression . r • for the same alleged harassm ent.\n\n[2] On December 3, 2002, Officer filed a Motion for Protective Order and to Stav Discovery or Alternative Motion fol' E><tension of Tim e to Serve Ob1ect1ons and Responses to\nD1scove1y (Officer Mot). In that molion, he requested               a stay of all discovery 1n this case under FED R C!V. P. 261cl pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. (Officer\nMot, at 5.) Alternatively, Officer requested that the Court grant him an extension of thirty days to respond or object to Plaintiff's discovery requests, and tl1at the Court issue a\nprotective order shielding Officer from having to produce infmmation that he believed would implicate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-1ncriminat1on in the state\ncnmmal proceeding. Id. at 8-9. On the same day, City filed its Motion and Brief to Strike Discovery Requests (City Mot), City primarily requested that the Court strike Plaintiff's\ndiscovery requests because th ey were mailed prematurely. (City Mot. at 1-2.) Plaintiff responded to both motions on December 9, 2002, and sought an order compelling City\nto produr.e all requested items.\n\nThe Court held a hearing on this matter December 20, 2002. During [3] the hearing, City stated that it was willing to produce all responsive Information, even that which\nmight implicate Officer's privilege. Officer objected to City's production of documents that might implicate his F1rt11 Arnen iJrnenl privilege . Officer admitted, however, that some\nof the requested documents -- for instance, his regularly maintained personnel Fiie and some internal investigative materials -- were discoverable and did not implicate his Eillh\nA<ne11 •J1n<;!lt privilege. Based on the motions, the response, and the oral arguments, the Court orally ruled that it would be inappropriate to stay all discovery in this case.\nOfficer and City were ordered to jointly review their respective discovery requests in order for Officer to determine which of City's responsrve information implicated his\nprivilege, and both defendants were ordered to submit to the Court for in camera review all responsive information that Officer believed would implicate his Fifth Ar11e11dmulj;\nprivilege. The submissions were to describe in detail, with supporting case law, l1ow each item l!Tiplicated Officer's privilege. Id. The Court also ordered City and Officer to\nproduce all responsive non-obiectionable documents [4] to Plaintiff within thirty days. On December 24, 2002, the CO(lrt issued a written Order to that effect. (Ord. at 1-2.)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                              RPI 0252\n\f Officer and City timely submitted separate sets of items for in camera review. However, only Orficer provided argument on how the requested Items would implicate his                                                               EJf1b.\nArnP[J[hnent privilege, Because City did not object to production, it saw no reason to present argument.

Protective Order\n\n\n1. Documents Produced by City\n\nCity submitted six categories of materials for in camera review pursuant to Officer's objection that they implicate his Fifth Amendment privilege because the statements were\ncompelled during the internal affairs investigation.\n\na. Appllcablllty of Privilege to Compelled Statements\n\nThis case 1s unique in that it is a federal civil action against a police officer who is currently under indictment in state court and who has already provided compelled statements\nto internal affairs investigators. Officer objects to Plaintiff's discovery from City on grounds that his statements to the internal affairs Investigators and City's act of producing\nthose statements would implicate his privilege in the criminal proceeding If discovered. While it is clear that Officer's Fi(th Amendment privilege would be implicated if discovery\nfrom him is not stayed, it is not clear that his privilege would be implicated by allowing Plaintiff to discover his statements [14] to the internal affairs investigators, City, or\nthe Terrell Police Department in this civil case.\n\ntf!l5.T The f1(th Amendment privilege is intended to protect an individual from being compelled to \"furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute\" him for a\ncrime.

If the\ninternal affairs investigators, City, or the Terrell Police Department have provided Officer's statements to the prosecution, then allowing the Plaintiff to discover them in this\ncase would not unconstitutionally furnish or disclose them to prosecution.\n\nAssuming that [15] the prosecution possesses or obtains Officer's statements, its use of those statements is restricted by the Supreme Court's decision In Garritv v New\nJersey 385 U.S 493 17 L Ed 2d 562 87 S. Ct 616 (196?l, which \"prevents                                                  !11!§.'Y any statements made In the course of the internal affairs investigation from being\nused against [police] officers in subsequent criminal proceedings,\" l u u: f ¢rpll tff411tt lt1rn PrPP\"\"\"lt1tl'f 975                               f 2d 148 $ 14 Q 0 j th qr 1991 1. Officer s statement to the  1\n\n\n\ninternal affairs investigators reflects that it was given unde1 a \"Garity [sic] Warning,\" and that if he refused to answer, he could be subject to termination. (Off. Sub. at Ex. B-\nl.) This warning specifically advised Officer that his statement \"cannot be used against [him] in any criminal proceeding.\" Id. In an analogous situation, the Ninth Circuit held\n\"that HN?'T the protection of the Fjrth Amendment privilege, when applied to statements by police officers in internal affairs files, must focus on the use of those statements\nagainst the officers who gave them. TI1e statements are not privileged from production to a subpoenaing authority, But the Fi(th Amqndment guards against any improper use\nof them.

According to these\ncases, the fifth Amendment privilege is implicated by the prosecution's J.W:, not possession, of Otflcer's statements.\n\nBecause neither side has had an opportunity to l>rief this issue, the parties shall be allowed ten days from the date on which this Order is filed to provide additional briefing\nsupported by case law.

Act of Production\n\nOfficer also objects that the City's act of responding to Plaintiff's request for production is a privileged \"act of production\" protected by the Supreme Court's decision in           ~\n\n~ r.l/C>   v. Hublicll 5 31111.6 27 . M Z L Cd.   ZsJ ] ·!. uto :;;, Ct. ?0)1 fZOOQl . The Hubbell case arose out of the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr into\nPresident Bill Clinton and Hiiiary Clinton's involvement in what was commonly called the \"Whitewater investigation,\" Hubbell, S:lO U,S at 30-3 1. During the investigation, the\ngovernment served Webster Hubbell, an attorney essociated with the Clintons, with a broadly-worded subpoena duces tewm seeking production of eleven broad categories of\ndocuments. ~·              The government did not describe the requested items with any particularity. Id. In his testimony before the grand jury, Mr. Hubbell asserted his              .Eltt.b.\nAr11e 11 dmeril privilege and refused \"to staL·e [20] whether there are documents within my possession, custody, or control responsive to the Subpoena,\" Id. The government\ngranted immunity \"to the extent allowed by law\" to gain the responsive documents, but later used those same documents to obtain a second indictment against Mr. Hubbell.\nId. On Mr. Hubbell's motion, the district determined that the government had violated its grant of immunity and dismissed the second indictment. Id. The government\nappealed. The appellate court reversed, deciding that the district court should have addressed \"the extent of the Government's independent knowledge of the documents'\nex istence and authenticity, and (Mr. Hubbell'sJ possession or control of them.\" The case was remanded, and the government petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari.\n\nJn the meantime, on remand, the governm ent entered into a plea agreement with Mr. Hubbell: portions of the agreement were contingent on the outcome of the petition for\ncertiorari. Id. dt 33 -34 . Despite the plea agreem ent, the Supreme Court granted the government's petition to \"determine the precise scope of a grant of immunity with\nrespect to tile production of documents 1n response [21] to a subpoena.\" ~. The Supreme Court explained that HN~ \"the act of producing documents in response\nto   a subµoena    may have   a compelled   test1mo11ial aspect. We have held that 'the act of production' itselr may implicitly communicate 'statements of fact.' By 'producing\ndocuments in compliance with a subpoena, the witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and we1e authentic\"' Id This \"act of\nproduction\" doctrine, as 1t is commonly referred to, clarifies that the act of responding to a compelled request may have a privileged testimonial effect if it \"could provide a\nprosecutor with     a lead to incriminating evidence,' or a 'link In the chain of evidence needed to prosecute.'\" Id.\n\nOfficer analogizes his case to Hubbell, and argues that City's act of producing ce1tain Items gives the prosecutor a \"lead to Incriminating evide11ce' or a 'link In the chain of\nevidence need to prosecute.\" (Officer Sub. at 30-31.) Officer claims that tile City's act of producing these items unconstitutionally compels hi:; privileged testimony. In Hubbell,\nthe privileged testimony arose out of the defendant's act of identifying and gathering (22] his documents responsive to a very broad subpoena directed to him. Plaintiff's\nrelevant requests for production are directed to City, and City's response requires no act by Officer that could be construed as his testimony. Thus, the concern in Hubbell -\nthe testimonial effect of a defendant's own actions -- is absent from Officer's case.\n\nIt is also detel'minat1ve that Oty does not object to its own act of production as privileged .        Is .t,l In fact, City has repeatedly stated -   at oral argument and in its in camera\nsubmission -- that it does not oppose Plamlirf's requests for production on Officer's Filth Amendment grounds. As explained in Hubbell:\n\n           It is doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession of the papers 1ises to the level of testimony within the protection of the Fifth Amendmen t.\n           The papers belong to the accountant, were prepared by him, and are the kind usuallv prepared bv an accountant working on the tax returns of his client. Surely\n           the Government is in no way relying on the 'truthtelling' of the taxpayer to prove the existence of or his access to the documents ... , The existence and location\n           of tl1e papers are a foregone [23] conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information by conceding that he 111\n           ract has the papers.\n\n\n\n\nliubtie/I 510 U.S . at 44 (emphasis added) (quoting frs/l(:r        1•   Uurt.:d :itdtes o)25 US J91 l 91 48 L. Ed. 2d 19 96 S r 1 1 s 49 11971ill. The items requested from City\nbelong to City, were prepared by City, and are the kind usually prepared man internal affairs investigation or day-to-day operations of the Terrell Police Department. Moreover.\nthe existence and authenticity of the items requested from City rnay be independently con finned by City or the Terl'cll Police Department. Thus, the prosecutor 1s n.ot relying\non Officer's \"truthtelling\" to prove the existence of or Officer's access to these items. Consequently, City's production does not implicate Officer's [24]              F1~h   Amendment\nprivilege,\n\n\n\n\n2.

Venue in Dallas County is proper in this cause under Section 15 .002( a)(2) of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because Defendant resides in this county.\n\n                                                FACTS\n\n         8.       Plaintiff and his wife are the owners of certain real property in Van Zandt County.\n\nPart of the property is a private driveway from their home entering onto Van Zandt County\n\nRoad 2319.\n\n         9.       Unknown to Plaintiff, Defendant Petruska and his wife had fraudulently filed\n\ndocuments in the real property records of Van Zandt County claiming an easement to use\n\nPlaintiffs driveway. No such easement existed.\n\n         10.      On or about February 14, 2014, Defendant Petruska was informed that Plaintiff\n\nwould be erecting a barrier along the driveway which would preclude any access from\n\nDefendant's property to the driveway. On or about February 15, 2014, Plaintiff was on his\n\ntractor transporting supplies for fencing on the driveway when he was met on the driveway by\n\nDefendant Petruska.\n\n         11.      Defendant Petruska began arguing with Plaintiff about an alleged right to use the\n\ndriveway which Plaintiff explicitly stated did not exist. Defendant Petruska then returned to his\n\nvehicle to get a weapon, what to Plaintiff appeared to be an ARI 5 assault weapon. Defendant\n\nPetruska walked onto Plaintiffs property and pointed the weapon directly at Plaintiff who was\n\nonly about ten (10) feet away, declaring he had a right to use Plaintiffs driveway. Defendant\n\nPetruska went on to tell Plaintiff that he was a Veteran of the war in Vietnam and suffered from\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder. Defendant stated, while pointing the weapon at Plaintiff, \"I've\n\nkilled a lot of men and you have not killed any and I am going to kill you.\" Plaintiff, in fear for\n\nhis life, put his arms in the air and told Defendant Petruska he was calling law enforcement on\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S ORIGINAL PETITION                                                                 Page 2\n\\\\Bdnt-fsl \\wpprolaw\\3191.003\\259143.docx\n                                                                                             RPI 0003\n\fhis mobile phone.         In response, Defendant Petruska walked across the property line to his\n\nproperty, still holding his weapon, and dared Plaintiff to call the Sheriff. Plaintiff quickly got on\n\nthe tractor and drove back to his house and called the Sheriff.\n\n                                      THREAT OF BODILY INJURY\n\n         12.      Defendant intentionally and knowingly threatened Plaintiff with imminent bodily\n\ninjury. Defendant pointed an assault rifle at Plaintiff from less than 10 feet away, and threatened\n\nPlaintiff with imminent bodily injury, expressing his intent shoot and to kill Plaintiff. Defendant\n\nstated to Plaintiff that Defendant had killed people in the past and that he suffered from a mental\n\ndisorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Plaintiff was in fear that he would be shot.\n\n         13.      Defendant's threat directly and proximately caused injury to Plaintiff. Plaintiff\n\ncontinues to suffer from apprehension that Defendant will cause him injury. When Defendant\n\nvisits the property Plaintiff feels forced to stay out of sight and to avoid any contact with\n\nDefendant.      This fear and apprehension has caused Plaintiff to suffer from nightmares and\n\ninsomnia, fear of leaving his home and inability to focus on anything other than the incident and\n\nsafety of his home and his wife at the times Defendant is at his home. Plaintiff now feels the\n\nneed to sleep with a weapon nearby. This severe apprehension and fear has caused damage\n\nincluding past and future pain and suffering, past and future mental anguish, loss of income,\n\nphysical impairment, past and future medical expenses and loss of consortium.\n\n                                            EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n\n         14.      Plaintiff would further show that Plaintiffs injuries resulted from Defendant's\n\nmalice. Defendant acted with the specific intent to cause substantial injury and/or harm to\n\nPlaintiff and to intimidate Plaintiff in granting Defendant a right to use Plaintiffs property. It\n\nwas Defendant's intent to intimidate Plaintiff into believing that an easement existed by utilizing\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S ORIGINAL PETITION                                                                 Page 3\n\\\\Bdnt-fsl \\wpprolaw\\3191.003\\259143.docx\n\n                                                                                             RPI 0004\n\fa deadly weapon to instill fear in Plaintiff, thus causing harm to Plaintiff.            Plaintiff seeks\n\nrecovery from Defendant for exemplary damages as provided by Section 41.003(a) of the Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code. As Defendant's conduct is described by the Texas Penal\n\nCode § 22.02 as an aggravated assault, the limitation of damages in Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code § 41.008 does not apply.\n\n                                            JURY DEMAND\n\n         15.      Plaintiff demands a jury trial and tenders the appropriate fee with this petition.\n\n                                      REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE\n\n         17.

Since search-and-seiz-       sonin1 is that the defendant has a\nure claims depend heavily upon their in-        choice: he may refuse to testify and\ndividual facts, 110 and since the law of        give up the benefit.\" When this as-\nsearch and seizure is in a state of flux,21     sumption is applied to a situation in\nthe incidence of such marginal cases can-       which the \"benefit\" to be gained is that\nnot be said to be negligible.

In these circumstances, we find it\n                                                intolerable that one constitutional right\n  The rule adopted by the courts below          should have to be surrendered in order\ndoes not merely impose upon a defend-           to assert another.

In ruling on a motion for stay, the court should also weigh the private interests of the\n              plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously against the prejudice that will be caused by the\n              delay that will result from the stay. Plaintiffs assert that the criminal case against Nichols\n              is proceeding slowly and uncertainly, with no specific trial date. Nevertheless, Texas law\n              recognizes a right to a speedy trial. Therefore, the court concludes that consideration of\n              the burden to be placed on the plaintiffs does not weigh heavily against a stay.\n\n              The court recognizes that, even if convicted, Nichols' Fifth Amendment privilege may\n              continue throughout the pendency of his direct appeal. See, e.g., Frank v. United States,\n              347 F.2d 486, 491 (D.C.Cir.1965). Because the issuance and duration of a stay are\n              committed to the court's sound discretion, and because imposition of a stay lasting\n              throughout the duration of Nichols' direct appeal (if he is convicted) would likely be unduly\n              burdensome to plaintiffs' interests, the court contemplates that the stay granted today will\n              remain in effect only through sentencing. If he is acquitted, the stay will terminate upon\n              the return of a not guilty verdict.\n\n                                                               4\n              *3 The court has also considered the private interest of MSC in securing the stay and the\n              burden on it that would result were the stay denied. As discussed above, absent a stay,\n              Nichols faces a conflict between asserting his Fifth Amendment rights and fulfilling his\n              legal obligations as a witness in this civil action. This conflict may be largely, if not\n              completely, eliminated by granting a stay of appropriate scope. Moreover, the court\n              discerns no substantial prejudice to plaintiffs from granting a partial stay. Therefore, the\n              court finds that MSC's private interest weighs in favor of abatement in part.\n\n                                                             5\n              Because the court concludes that granting a stay will not unduly interfere with the court's\n              management of its docket, it finds that the court's interests do not weigh against a stay.\n              Additionally, the court holds that the interests of the public do not weigh against a stay.\n\n                                                           6\n              MSC seeks abatement of the entire suit, contending that Nichols is unable to participate\n              in discovery or in MSC's defense, thereby compromising its ability to defend itself. The\n              court is not persuaded that all discovery must be halted. There would appear to be a\n              great deal of discovery that both parties could undertake, including that concerning the\n

              the extent that plaintiffs are precluded from taking Nichols' deposition and from\n               conducting any discovery that MSC can show, by motion, will or is likely to subject it to\n               undue prejudice by reason of Nichols' unavailability as a witness to MSC or to assist it in\n               its defense.\n\n               Based on its consideration of the above factors, and in the interests of justice, the court\n               grants in part MSC's motion to abate and, to the extent set forth above, abates discovery\n               in this case until such time as a verdict of not guilty has been returned or sentencing has\n

The court grants the request for ruling, and decides the motion today.\n\n                3             The court will not organize its analysis based on plaintiffs' arguments,\n

               on the personal nature of the Fifth Amendment privilege. While it is true that\n

Not surprisingly, the district court\n          held that plaintiff had not alleged an enterprise since he failed to specify the structure or personnel of the enterprise or\n          how the various defendants came together as a group. Id. at 98.\n            Here, defendants are not unrelated entities, but are closely affiliated: plaintiffs have alleged that the individual\n            defendants are the controlling officers of the corporate defendants and that the corporate defendants are alter egos of\n            one another. Thus, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged an enterprise .\n17        See Center Cadillac, 808 F.Supp. at 230 (citation omitted).\n18        Section 1964(c) of RICO provides that:\n                 Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue\n                 therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains ...\n            Thus, to have standing to bring a civil RICO claim, plaintiffs must show that defendants' violation of section 1962 caused\n            an injury to their business or property.

The plaintiff in Bankers Trust, alleged that\n          it was fraudulently induced by a bankrupt corporation's officers into accepting only 17.5% of its outstanding claim from\n          the corporation. In dismissing the portion of the RICO claim seeking repayment of a lost debt, the appeals court held\n          that the lost debt damages were too speculative to state a claim since the plaintiffs RICO injuries could be reduced or\n          magnified depending on the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings\n            In First Nationwide, the plaintiff bank's RICO claim that borrowers fraudulently induced it to make nonrecourse loans\n            was dismissed where the bank had not yet attempted to foreclose on the loans. The appeals court noted that any loss\n            with respect to the loans could not be determined until the bank attempted foreclosure and \"only when [the bank's]\n            actual loss becomes clear and definite will the claims be ripe for suit\". 27 F.3d at768-69.\n\n\nEnd of Do cument                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters No claim to original U .S Government Works\n\n\n\n\n  ~   I     t'.Jc..'.1                                                 II\n                                                                                                                             RPI 0244\n\f72                            218 FEDERAL RULES DECISIONS\n\n Plaintiffs Response at 4 (emphasis added).          for sanctions, available to a prevailing party\n Contrary to the assertions in McGirr's Sup-         pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, shall be filed by\n plemental Declaration, Ms. Tharp, Plaintiffs        Defendant within 10 days of service of this\nVice President for Manufacturing testified,          Decision and Order.

Defendant\n    officer sought a stay of further discovery until the completion of criminal proceedings against him.\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    Plaintiff officer claimed that defendant officer harassed her. Defendant officer was indicted on a misdemeanor charge of official oppression for the same alleged\n    harassment. Defendant officer sought a stay of further discovery and a protective order shielding him from having to produce information that he believed would\n    implicate his Fifth Amendment privilege. The city was willing to produce all responsive information, even that which might have implicated defendant officer's privilege. Jn\n    g1anting defendant officer's request for a stay, the court held that several factors weighed in favor of a stay, including the degree to which the civil issues overlapped with\n    the criminal issues and the fact that defendant officer had been indicted for the same conduct that was the subject of the civil case. The court held that, with respect to\n    compelled statements made by defendant officer to the city's internal affairs investigators, if the statements were provided to the prosecution, allowing plaintiff officer to\n    discover them would not have violated defendant officer's Fif\\h Amendment privilege because the privilege only guarded against the improper use of the compelled\n    statements.\n\n\n\n\n    Outcome\n\n    The court ordered defendants to produce, with exceptions, all documents that had been submitted for in camera review. The court stayed further discovery from\n    defendant officer until he was convicted and sentenced, acquitted, or the charges were dropped in the state criminal proceeding .\n\n\n\n\n    ., LexisNexis® Headnotes\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                RPI 0250\n\fCivil Procedure   > ... >   ~ ...        > Pri vjleged Commu njcatlons • > General Overy jew ...\nConstitutional Law> ... > Eu r1da m enta!

Even where <i party has a legitimate claim of privilege with respect\nto certain questions or lines of Inquiry, that person may not be entitled to invoke his privilege to remain totally silent. Only where the court finds that he could\n!eg1tlmate!y refuse to answer essentially all relevant questions, because or the threat of incrimination from any relevant questioning is a person totally excused from\nresponding to relevant inquiries. Otherwise, a person Is entitled to invoke the privilege only as to genuinely tlireatening questions. A blanket assertion of the privilege\nwithout inquiry by the court is unacceptable. The court may conduct an in camera review of the items at issue to determine 1f the privilege applies.

In deciding whether to stay discovery in light of a party's Firth A1pendrn1:nt privilege, a court must balance the interests of the party asserting the privilege\nagainst any preiudice resulting to the other parties. To achieve that balance, the court uses a six-factor test: (1) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case\noverlap with those presented In the civil case; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendants have been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously, weighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; (4) the private Interests of and burden on the defendants; (5) the\ninterests of the courts; and (6) the public Interest.

A stay of\na civil case is most appropriate where a party to the civil case has already been indicted for the same conduct for two reasons: first, the likelihood that• defendant may\nmake incriminating statements is greetest after an indictment has issued, and second, the prejudice to the plaintiffs in the civil case is reduced since the criminal case\nwill likely be quickly resolved due to Speedy Trial Act consider•tions.

BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 24, 2002, Jessica Frierson (Plaintiff), an officer with the Terrell Police Department, initiated this civil action against the City oflerrell (City) and another officer,\nAlejandro Suarez (Officer), for alleged harassment under •12 V S.C. § 1983. On or about October 10, 2001, Office1 was indicted m state court on a class A m1Sdemeanor charge\nof Officral Oppression . r • for the same alleged harassm ent.\n\n[2] On December 3, 2002, Officer filed a Motion for Protective Order and to Stav Discovery or Alternative Motion fol' E><tension of Tim e to Serve Ob1ect1ons and Responses to\nD1scove1y (Officer Mot). In that molion, he requested               a stay of all discovery 1n this case under FED R C!V. P. 261cl pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. (Officer\nMot, at 5.) Alternatively, Officer requested that the Court grant him an extension of thirty days to respond or object to Plaintiff's discovery requests, and tl1at the Court issue a\nprotective order shielding Officer from having to produce infmmation that he believed would implicate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-1ncriminat1on in the state\ncnmmal proceeding. Id. at 8-9. On the same day, City filed its Motion and Brief to Strike Discovery Requests (City Mot), City primarily requested that the Court strike Plaintiff's\ndiscovery requests because th ey were mailed prematurely. (City Mot. at 1-2.) Plaintiff responded to both motions on December 9, 2002, and sought an order compelling City\nto produr.e all requested items.\n\nThe Court held a hearing on this matter December 20, 2002. During [3] the hearing, City stated that it was willing to produce all responsive Information, even that which\nmight implicate Officer's privilege. Officer objected to City's production of documents that might implicate his F1rt11 Arnen iJrnenl privilege . Officer admitted, however, that some\nof the requested documents -- for instance, his regularly maintained personnel Fiie and some internal investigative materials -- were discoverable and did not implicate his Eillh\nA<ne11 •J1n<;!lt privilege. Based on the motions, the response, and the oral arguments, the Court orally ruled that it would be inappropriate to stay all discovery in this case.\nOfficer and City were ordered to jointly review their respective discovery requests in order for Officer to determine which of City's responsrve information implicated his\nprivilege, and both defendants were ordered to submit to the Court for in camera review all responsive information that Officer believed would implicate his Fifth Ar11e11dmulj;\nprivilege. The submissions were to describe in detail, with supporting case law, l1ow each item l!Tiplicated Officer's privilege. Id. The Court also ordered City and Officer to\nproduce all responsive non-obiectionable documents [4] to Plaintiff within thirty days. On December 24, 2002, the CO(lrt issued a written Order to that effect. (Ord. at 1-2.)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                              RPI 0252\n\f Officer and City timely submitted separate sets of items for in camera review. However, only Orficer provided argument on how the requested Items would implicate his                                                               EJf1b.\nArnP[J[hnent privilege, Because City did not object to production, it saw no reason to present argument.

Accordingly, these items shall be produced to Plaintiff within ten days of the date of this order.\n\nc. Act of Production\n\nOfficer also objects that the City's act of responding to Plaintiff's request for production is a privileged \"act of production\" protected by the Supreme Court's decision in           ~\n\n~ r.l/C>   v. Hublicll 5 31111.6 27 . M Z L Cd.   ZsJ ] ·!. uto :;;, Ct. ?0)1 fZOOQl . The Hubbell case arose out of the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr into\nPresident Bill Clinton and Hiiiary Clinton's involvement in what was commonly called the \"Whitewater investigation,\" Hubbell, S:lO U,S at 30-3 1. During the investigation, the\ngovernment served Webster Hubbell, an attorney essociated with the Clintons, with a broadly-worded subpoena duces tewm seeking production of eleven broad categories of\ndocuments. ~·              The government did not describe the requested items with any particularity. Id. In his testimony before the grand jury, Mr. Hubbell asserted his              .Eltt.b.\nAr11e 11 dmeril privilege and refused \"to staL·e [20] whether there are documents within my possession, custody, or control responsive to the Subpoena,\" Id. The government\ngranted immunity \"to the extent allowed by law\" to gain the responsive documents, but later used those same documents to obtain a second indictment against Mr. Hubbell.\nId. On Mr. Hubbell's motion, the district determined that the government had violated its grant of immunity and dismissed the second indictment. Id. The government\nappealed. The appellate court reversed, deciding that the district court should have addressed \"the extent of the Government's independent knowledge of the documents'\nex istence and authenticity, and (Mr. Hubbell'sJ possession or control of them.\" The case was remanded, and the government petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari.\n\nJn the meantime, on remand, the governm ent entered into a plea agreement with Mr. Hubbell: portions of the agreement were contingent on the outcome of the petition for\ncertiorari. Id. dt 33 -34 . Despite the plea agreem ent, the Supreme Court granted the government's petition to \"determine the precise scope of a grant of immunity with\nrespect to tile production of documents 1n response [21] to a subpoena.\" ~. The Supreme Court explained that HN~ \"the act of producing documents in response\nto   a subµoena    may have   a compelled   test1mo11ial aspect. We have held that 'the act of production' itselr may implicitly communicate 'statements of fact.' By 'producing\ndocuments in compliance with a subpoena, the witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and we1e authentic\"' Id This \"act of\nproduction\" doctrine, as 1t is commonly referred to, clarifies that the act of responding to a compelled request may have a privileged testimonial effect if it \"could provide a\nprosecutor with     a lead to incriminating evidence,' or a 'link In the chain of evidence needed to prosecute.'\" Id.\n\nOfficer analogizes his case to Hubbell, and argues that City's act of producing ce1tain Items gives the prosecutor a \"lead to Incriminating evide11ce' or a 'link In the chain of\nevidence need to prosecute.\" (Officer Sub. at 30-31.) Officer claims that tile City's act of producing these items unconstitutionally compels hi:; privileged testimony. In Hubbell,\nthe privileged testimony arose out of the defendant's act of identifying and gathering (22] his documents responsive to a very broad subpoena directed to him. Plaintiff's\nrelevant requests for production are directed to City, and City's response requires no act by Officer that could be construed as his testimony. Thus, the concern in Hubbell -\nthe testimonial effect of a defendant's own actions -- is absent from Officer's case.\n\nIt is also detel'minat1ve that Oty does not object to its own act of production as privileged .        Is .t,l In fact, City has repeatedly stated -   at oral argument and in its in camera\nsubmission -- that it does not oppose Plamlirf's requests for production on Officer's Filth Amendment grounds. As explained in Hubbell:\n\n           It is doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession of the papers 1ises to the level of testimony within the protection of the Fifth Amendmen t.\n           The papers belong to the accountant, were prepared by him, and are the kind usuallv prepared bv an accountant working on the tax returns of his client. Surely\n           the Government is in no way relying on the 'truthtelling' of the taxpayer to prove the existence of or his access to the documents ... , The existence and location\n           of tl1e papers are a foregone [23] conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information by conceding that he 111\n           ract has the papers.\n\n\n\n\nliubtie/I 510 U.S . at 44 (emphasis added) (quoting frs/l(:r        1•   Uurt.:d :itdtes o)25 US J91 l 91 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

The items requested from City\nbelong to City, were prepared by City, and are the kind usually prepared man internal affairs investigation or day-to-day operations of the Terrell Police Department. Moreover.\nthe existence and authenticity of the items requested from City rnay be independently con finned by City or the Terl'cll Police Department. Thus, the prosecutor 1s n.ot relying\non Officer's \"truthtelling\" to prove the existence of or Officer's access to these items. Consequently, City's production does not implicate Officer's [24]              F1~h   Amendment\nprivilege,\n\n\n\n\n2. Production by Officer\n\nOfficer produced documents and items labeled Exhibits A, Bl-12, and C.
